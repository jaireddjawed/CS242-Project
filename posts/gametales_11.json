        "text": "All Outta Bubblegum is one of those games that I’d gone cold on before getting very hot on it, and I think what made me want to come back to it was doing it live, as in, in a call with the clock ticking. I get to cram as much insanity as I can into two hours of play, and I MUST deliver on a climax worthy of the very end of every episode. Maybe it speaks to the tremendous energy I want to release whenever I play tabletop, and as GM I get to go totally thermonuclear to the laughter of my players. It’s also where the players get to do the same, too. In fact, it’s how you’re supposed to play the game.\n\nThe entirety of AoB’s rules are that everyone starts with a stack of eight points in Gum, and that’s your only stat. Every time you want to do something mundane, you must roll a d10 at or under your Gum score, and every time you want to do something badass, you must roll over that score. Succeed at either, great! Fail and you must give up a piece of Gum. You can also voluntarily spend a piece in order to auto-succeed at doing something mundane, and that means everyone has free reign to go totally nucking futs by the time an episode ends, and it’s amazing for, well, episodic play. Oh yeah, one last thing: if you’re out of bubblegum you can only do badass things but mundane stuff becomes entirely impossible. Also, if someone hits you dead red with a 10 on a kickass roll, you are immediately taken out of the episode/session. No ifs, ands or buts. If you're outta Gum and you're smacked by a 10, you're donezo. Down for the count. Outies. A goner. You're knocked right the hell out, too.\n\nThe fact that insanity is guaranteed for every session and that your pacing is basically up to the whim of the dice since suddenly, rolls can go south for a spell and leave someone an inexplicable superhero at 2 Gum while everyone else is at like 5 or so means this is an exercise in improv comedy that works best with a really mundane starting point for the most jarring contrast between the start of an episode and the end. This is something I mostly got from the One Shot podcast, where the setting was “you are all trying to reach your flights at an airport” and it ended with ghosts and magical girls and giant spiders. I was also influenced by a YouTube video where the plot was “you are all bubblegum shop owners in the same mall on what turns out to be the last two days of your lives.” That one ended with a climactic DBZ battle between the characters that ended with two of the three heroes dead and the third living just long enough to see a twelve-story-tall mall collapse on him from sustained bombardment by tanks and F-16s after pushing out a fourth, evil, GM-supplied shop owner.\n\nI spun this differently. My plot, one I’d done twice, was “You are all cats in the same cat cafe at a mall.”\n\n**ISSUE #0: The Kickass Cats Origin Story**\n\nThe first time I tried this, I had a team of cats where the plot quickly became that there’s a snooty pastry shop owner starting his own cat cafe and trying to run the cats out of town. However, that’s for later: for now, the cats dinked around, trying to outdo one another impressing the patrons. A particularly big cat, a huge Maine Coon, tried jumping around all the play furniture and inelegantly rammed one of those fuzzy towers made of cubbyholes you can buy for a cat before falling flat on his ass.\n\nThis was when I made my move, because one guy, a tiny cat I think we all agreed to call Baron, had managed to shed almost all his Gum through constantly trying to impress customers with asskicking rolls he had no real chance of succeeding: the cats in the other shop were attacking through the service hallways and were dropkicked back into the hall, so they responded with a giant robot made of mall strollers, a super-agile cat that fought with supernatural powers...and then, the owner of the heroes’ cafe was kidnapped when the villain tried to get her to sign over her cafe. To fight the remaining cats that weren’t all run off by the heroes, they got superpowers. One was big and fat and that was basically his whole character, so he weaponized his bulk. Another turned into a “mighty dragon cat” and another got really really high on catnip and had nip-fueled visions that told him where to go.\n\nWhat about Baron? Well, I’d already decided on something from a house rule of mine: if someone rolls really high on an asskicking roll or really low on a mundane roll, they don’t just succeed at what they do, they succeed epically. So when Baron decided to sacrifice a half-eaten cream puff early on to Catthulhu, he turned in a 10 and I decided to make it an insane Bayonetta-style summoning where Catthulhu sprung from the table, spiked the cream puff into the abyss like a football, and pawbumped Baron. Alright, so an Umbra Witch, a dragon-cat, weaponized lard, a cat trippin’ balls and a perfectly normal Maine Coon whose superpowers were just being really big and huge are all closing in on a ridiculously snooty patisserie with a sign that hurt to look at and hostages that kept dressing down their kidnapper for trying to make them sign a document that one, wouldn’t hold up in court and two, required them to not be bound and gagged to actually sign the stupid thing.\n\nThis was where I hadn’t quite figured out how to have longer, cooler-looking boss battles in such a simplistic system. Naturally, with all the cats burning through their Gum I said what amounted to “hit the guy with 10s a buncha times.” I tried to have a long enough boss battle by giving him multiple forms as a long-furred cat that absorbed the souls of his own allies to keep on fighting.\n\nI only realized what a dumb thing I had done when I crunched the numbers as I played...I’d decided the guys needed to hit 10s like several times and it had only dawned on me that giving the heroes a flat 10% chance to do a damage shot - not a kill shot, just a damage shot - was a terrible idea that led to a long fight that I aggressively shaved off just to make the fight bearable. It worked, the cafe was saved, and a second episode never quite took off.\n\n**ISSUE #1: Continuity Reboot**\n\nThat wasn’t the end. I learned my mistakes and took this idea to the group I’d been playing D&amp;D with nearly every weekend, and gave them the same brief.\n\nThere were two key differences: one, this was using Discord and Roll20, so I could fill a map with all kinds of ridiculous stores labeled with goofy jokes like “It’s Just Pocket Tees,” “Walter White’s Totally Legitimate, Yesireebob Drugstore,” and everyone’s favorite, “We Are Number One But It’s A Sporting Goods Store,” and two, probably because it was a direct result of Difference #1, rather than doing cute cat things, my friends wanted to cause chaos by dinking around in the mall, which I encouraged because I said the cat cafe this time around was very inconveniently placed in the middle of a food court, and worse, it was open-air, which meant the cats would just wander around and cause mayhem. They climbed into shirts in It’s Just Pocket Tees, tried to make off with a door-sized bar of chocolate in the Candy Store What Sells Candy And Everything, and kicked over everything in the PopStation Kiosk.\n\nThey were also totally aware that the first time I tried this, the cats got superpowers, so all they were waiting for was a reason, although they were having enough fun just screwing around with the mall. I figured they’d go to a store they haven’t visited yet and try to cause chaos, then once the time was right, I’d flow into something naturally.\n\nI...suppose I’d be tipping my hand as a storyteller if the next things that you read are “So they decide to mess with a gigantic store called ‘Frubby Fizzbird’s Pizza, Arcade, And Unexploded Ordnance Storage (Bring The Kids!)’”\n\n...so they decide to mess with a gigantic store called “Frubby Fizzbird’s Pizza, Arcade, And Unexploded Ordnance Storage (Bring The Kids!)” and I had to deliver because at this point I’d just made rooms to plan as hilarious setpieces for the cats to screw around with. I decided to cast the animatronics in Frubby’s as...even more deranged than Scott Cawthorn’s world-famous killer animatronics.\n\nSee, Frubby and his pals were drunkards who had grown to hate their job, Frubby most of all. I delivered this with all the grace and subtlety of a Gallagher punchline, which made me whisk myself into one of the most secluded parts of my house so I could really rant, and my performance of a slurred-voiced, totally sloshed purple Freddy bird thing went right up to eleven, killing my players laughing since once I’d gotten a handle on how Frubby needed to be totally over the top, I couldn’t slow down at all. Finally, the cats got noticed during one of Frubby’s performances and he decided that was the last straw, and all the animatronics yanked out Tommy Guns and opened fire, taking everyone in Frubby’s hostage while the animatronics all grabbed the unexploded ordnance in the pizzeria and tried to plant it all over the mall and wire it to blow.\n\nAnd so, it was time for the cats to get their own superpowers. Allow me to formally introduce your heroes:\n\nSoldier:420 (yeah, yeah, I know), who got his powers from a shopping spree at “Clarkson, May And Hammond’s Discount Assault Rifles And Hammers,” with the superpowers of...uh...shooting real good!\n\nLady Doctor Professor Weird, who got her powers from going into the extremely badly-lit “The Edgier Image” and gaining powers from the void, gaining darkness powers and a sweet cape. Pay attention to the “void” bit. That’ll be important before too long.\n\nPurrnobyl, whose powers came from two places: catnip and nuclear energy. Purrnobyl can fly and has atomic powers, or, well...that was me being all Superman and I just decided to throw in flight and super strength because once you’re a nuclear-powered Not Hulk there’s only so much more you can add to spice that up without getting gimmicky.\n\nCure Fuzz, who got her powers from the Infeasibly Large Precure Merchandise Shop (well, infeasibly large if you’re not in Japan, I suppose) and awakened as a not-Mahoutsukai Precure (think Cute Witch with totally boss magic wands and martial arts chops) with all the requisite powers...uhh...totally boss magic wands and martial arts chops. Whaddya want, Pretty Cure are direct fighters with wash-and-wear powers for facing direct threats.\n\nThis motley crew had two objectives: keep the bombs from going off and defeat Frubby’s gang. Soldier:420 would go for the direct approach and shooting out with the animatronics, while the others hunted for the bombs. Lady Doctor Professor Weird would suck the bombs into the void where they wouldn’t hurt anything and Purrnobyl and Cure Fuzz would use a combination of speed, strength and finesse. Thankfully the hunt went well with the rolls on their side, and soon it was time for the final showdown with Frubby, which I had to speed along because you really can’t keep a story running for that long when someone’s already running maybe like three or two Gum before it becomes stalling, and here’s where my friends surprised me.\n\nSee, I was not prepared for Lady Doctor Professor Weird’s player to go “I suck the whole pizzeria into the void” and for me to honor that when she succeeded. I wasn’t about to not reward that, so in Frubby and his gang went.\n\nWhole.\n\nOutta the game, but not killed, you’ll notice. I could use that for later episodes, where everyone’s Gum scores were reset and all the insanity could start again.\n\nOur heroes got a new cafe since the pizzeria was pretty much erased and an empty storefront remained, they saved the day without anybody even hurt, and became the city’s superheroes: the Kickass Cats.\n\n**ISSUE #2: The Easter Special**\n\nThe Kickass Cats returned for a game on Easter Sunday, so I cooked up an Easter Special. We open on the Kickass Cats enjoying their new cat cafe/arcade/superhero base and deciding to do what all superpowered cats do with their awesome powers: mess with the mall.\n\nA lot of it had to do with messing around with the other shops, and especially centered around the shop that took up their old place in the food court. I wanted to do a pizza place, but I blanked. So, I called it “More Pizza Than Is Strictly Safe” and my group once again filled in gaps that we could use for more comedy when they asked if it had a Leaning Tower Of Pizza. Immediately our heroes decided to mess with this, stealing slices and having the entire food court holding its collective breath on whether or not the thing was going to fall over. Eventually, with the rolls on their side they finally got the thing to tip over, which the whole food court greeted with riotous applause. Hey, it worked!\n\nHere’s where the plot began: The Easter Bunny himself visited the mall, and the Kickass Cats’ first instinct was to try to kick his ass, so it’s a good thing he immediately talked about what he was there for: he needed the Kickass Cats to investigate something at a mall-sized department store just for candy. See, there was a freaking enormous display stand for Similar To But Legally Distinct From Kinder Eggs, said to have been made with really high-end building toys inside. Y’know, like dinky little snap-fit model kits and stuff. Problem was that the things had gone missing, so the plot was essentially a high-stakes Easter egg hunt with an accompanying mystery: who the hell would steal a bunch of chocolate eggs with prizes in them?\n\nThe Kickass Cats got to work, though naturally they also used this opportunity to go find more stuff they’d like, like going into a section for Japanese sweets to find pocky, grabbing soda, sour candy, chocolate and peanut butter, all sorts of good stuff, as well as to look for the chocolate eggs.\n\nAs it turned out, our heroes were just finding the chocolate shells with no toys. Now remember that I’ve been improvising all of this from the word go, just making up the map beforehand and figuring out some way to save Easter. I threw out employees of “Fizzbird Entertainment” as a throwaway line, and when my players bit, I decided that was good as anything else, and so I fired away. In hindsight it was the best thing to go on since this was a disgruntled Fizzbird Entertainment employee who worked on the toys seeking revenge for his income stream being yanked out from under him, and had built the toys as a combiner robot weapon.\n\n...a really tiny weapon, because it was made up of toys that fit into bitty plastic capsules that fit into chocolate eggs, so it was a combiner that made...a suit.\n\nThat was another fight that ended with Lady Doctor Professor Weird sucking the villain into the void, with everyone sucked in whole, too.\n\nThat’s all the issues of the Ballad of the Kickass Cats so far, and you’ll notice they’re building a bit of a rogues gallery that’s stuck in the same place where they could all run into one another and oh hey, they seem to work well together, what with all being machines, little tiny machines, and at least one engineer...food for thought when it comes to future issues, eh?\n\nWatch this space, true believers.",

        "text": "* [&lt;&lt; previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/6x79po/vtm_jalees_kamal_villain_by_proxy_part_5/)\n\nThe game took a small jump of in-game time from late August to mid-November, which brought with it the complexities of Lady ST’s “extended downtime” mechanics. Which is to say, she didn’t exactly have any.\n\nWhen we resumed the next session, she informed us of the time jump and asked if there was anything we wanted to accomplish during the downtime. I was shocked that everyone was so nonchalant about describing pretty basic stuff. If Edvin had that much downtime to work with, then his character sheet would have really beefed up. I wrote a short note to Lady ST about needing to talk with her about it later, to which she nodded. I then wrote a note to Trev to remind him to check on the blood banks and see how much of the loan he had managed to pay back. Edvin did not want to hear from Jalees that the loan was not being repaid on time.\n\nElection day had come and gone, and a vast majority of the State Senate had been replaced by Gentle Moderates, including the Governor - “Abirah Shultz” was elected, and immediately drummed up an army to help with the handover procedures. The rhetoric and energy of the newly empowered Gentle Moderates astounded the rest of the administration into an advanced case of Lame Duck. The Senate and Governor’s office elected to push no changes through as they were assured - with the Gentle Moderates about to hold an 80% majority - that anything they did would be repealed and replaced before it could come into effect.\n\nHearing how the game had taken a strong political turn somewhat unsettled the other players. I didn’t mind, but I also knew the cause of the politics, and where I was taking it. The players had a short discussion about what the sudden change in political landscape would mean for the city, and how the unrest may bubble up into the Vampire courts of the state. Edwin let them talk, whilst taking notes about what they said, interested to see if he could attempt to pin the entire debacle on them in the end.\n\nLady ST waited for them to quiet down, then continued her recap of the downtime. The city had begun to flourish, people were out and about more, the nightlife had ramped up and the housing market was beginning to boom. As the heat of the summer died down, the city had begun to draw more people - and with more people came more eyes. A couple of minor Masquerade breaches had happened, and the Prince was cracking down on even the most innocent mistakes. “Until the city settles to its new equilibrium”, Prince Santino had said, “we must all be on our most guarded behavior.”\n\nThen Lady ST told us to roll for blood.\n\nWhich was kinda weird, given that we had just done this big thing about saving the blood banks and making sure our supply was stable and uninterrupted. She smiled and nodded when I brought this up, and said “Yes, and that’s doing fine, but you need to roll for blood.” I pondered if I could have opened up one of the various blood casks that I had hidden around my haven, but opted to play the part and roll for blood - I could always restock after we started for real.\n\nEdvin, Brain and Miser did rather well with 8 or better, King did alright with a 6, but it was Thea that was most concerning. Thea, you see… Thea had rolled a 1. A botch - a dramatic misfortune of a failure. Normally, a failure is something that sucks, but doesn’t immediately put the character in a position for a follow-up curb stomping. An attack may miss, but you don’t drop or damage the weapon. A botch is the difference between missing a jump between buildings and landing on the fire escape, and missing a jump between buildings and landing on the sidewalk.\n\nThea botched a blood roll, meant to determine how much blood we started at that session. Not only did she start the night with only a single point of blood ( after consuming one to wake that night ), dark red lines appeared on her skin, following the larger blood vessels. Not only was she starving for fresh blood, she was infected.\n\nInfected with something potent enough to show on a corpse.\n\nVampires aren’t affected by mortal diseases. They can be a carrier, but in general, they aren’t actually affected by the illness. AIDS, SARS, Cancer, Syphilis - nothing mundane. If you drink from a mortal with AIDS, and then drink from another mortal without a proper cleaning, or without cleansing the blood, then you probably spread AIDS to your next meal. Same with other blood-transmittable diseases. However, you don’t show any signs of being infected, at all.\n\nSo we were freaking out at least four different ways as Lady ST told us this, and Thea comes charging out not in a frenzy, but on the edge of one, and began rooting around for blood packets that were usually kept stock in the communal Fridge, but we were out that particular night. The rest of us, staring at her in shock, began to notice the dark red lines standing out against her skin, and began to freak out with her.\n\nWell, everyone but Edvin. Edvin had a plan. (okay, I had a plan. But Edvin was smart enough to know the plan too.) I handed a rather long note to Lady ST, she replied aloud with “That’s fine.” As Thea grew closer and closer to frenzy, the other members of the coterie grew more and more tense. Edvin finally broke the relative silence.\n\n&gt;Edvin: “Thea, dear, what do you seek in the icebox?”  \n&gt;Thea: “Blood, Edvin. I did not realise how hungry I was when we went to sleep last night. I am in considerable need.” - At least, that’s what she tried to say. It came out more like “BLOOD NOW!”  \n&gt;E: “Yes, clearly. Follow me into my workshop. Let us see if we can’t get you a little more presentable.”  \n&gt;Thea: “Well certainly, Edvin. If you have a solution to my predicament I will gladly follow you.” - again, probably. It sounded more like “BLOOD NOW!”.  \n\nAnd so Edvin guided Thea to his workshop, stuck a feeding tube down her throat, and broke the wax on one of his earthenware pots that he kept in various corners of the haven. As Thea was attempting to gnaw through the kevlar-and-carbon-nanotube-reinforced feeding tube, Edvin dumped eight points’ worth of vitae down the tube into her stomach. This had proved to be an effective way of bypassing the normal limit of how fast a vampire could actually swallow blood.\n\nOnce the two-ish gallons of blood had cleared the tube, he removed it and told her to lie still while she absorbed it. He went over to a rather large wall of drawers and began to pull various thaumaturgical bits and bobs out and arranging them on the floor. Thea was unaccustomed to the process of imbibing blood without the Kiss - i.e. without actually drawing it from a human - and the process is a little less pleasant without the added high from the Kiss. The food-tube method helps to bypass the inevitable issue of spills, as well. Edvin finished his arrangement of the thaumaturgical ritual of Purify the Flesh. Each ST runs it a bit differently, and Lady ST allowed me some leeway with the specifics. \n\n&gt;E: “When you’re ready, strip and sit in the middle of the circle.”  \n&gt;T: “Strip? Not likely.”  \n&gt;E: “Well, the ritual in question is particularly potent. If you begin it wearing clothes, or jewelry, or tattoo ink, even, it’ll be gone by the end.”  \n&gt;T: “You just want to see me in my birthday suit.”  \n&gt;E: “If I did, Thea dear, I would simply do so while you slumber during the day.”  \n\nThea thought about that for a while, and then stripped and sat in the middle of the circle. Edvin began to chant in Old Norse, and walked widdershins around the circle. He cut his palm and flicked blood on Thea as he completed his third, seventh and thirteenth revolution, and stopped on the seventeenth. As he walked, the impurities drained out of Thea. All impurities - drugs, dirt, bullets, disease, rot - anything that wasn’t a part of Thea’s natural state were removed.\n\nI passed all of my rolls, and so was quite surprised that the ritual had no effect. Well, it had a reduced effect. The dark red lines paled, and became light enough that an onlooker would have to be actively searching for them to find them. Edvin was flat-out surprised, and Thea was an appropriate mix of overjoyed and disappointed. Edvin, convinced that whoever had created the disease, had at least as good a knowledge of Thaumaturgy as he did, and likely even better. He picked up the ritual trappings as Thea dressed, and then sent her out in order to send a coded message to Jalees about the issue.\n\nHis response was neither enlightening nor heartening.\n",

        "text": "This story is about 4 characters, my Sister of Battle character named Sabiah Alba, a Guardsman from Armageddon named Fredrick Schmidt, a Vindicare assassin named Nicanor, and a psyker known only as the Jester. The Jester's player was at work for most of the session so he only becomes involved at the end of the story.\n\nI played a session of Dark Heresy tonight which took place right after my party had fought through a station infested with Dark Eldar. We were on a feudal world that the Eldar fleet had been seen around multiple times but hadn't interacted with the planet to anyone's knowledge. After landing on the planet we had gotten into disguises and entered the city. One of the first things we saw in the city was a large crowd around an inn that were talking about a murder inside of the in, upon investigating it turns out that the innkeep was killed in an \"animal attack\". We decide to investigate by claiming we are a group from the governor and require entrance.\n\nInside of the inn there is a brutal crime scene, blood everywhere. A few perception checks later and we discover that a painting on the wall has blood flowing out from it, the painting depicts a fight. The Vindicare assassin in the group looks at the painting and then gets the urge to keep looking, eventually getting the urge to paint something like it. My character decides to try and take the painting by kneeing the Vindicare in the crotch, this fails however the guardsman is able to stab the painting with his knife which breaks the curse. The painting lets out a bloodcurdling scream and bleeds a lot. We exit the building and demand that it be locked, while covered in blood.\n\nWe call an inquisitor to the surface to assist in investigation and find the source of the painting to be a painters shop in the north of town. We head there and begin talking to the painter, she doesn't seem to be a chaos cultist as we suspected however. We learn that she gets her paint from someone in the mountains, the inquisitor also discovers that the paint has blood as an ingredient. We're about to leave before my character hears wet footsteps from the other room. I point it out and she starts saying \"oh no it's just something that needs to go to sleep, it's fine\" we ignore her and I bust down the door. Inside is a large monster made of the paint, I throw a grenade into the room which does no damage to the monster and the guardsman closes the door. The monster tries to break through the door and I shoot it through the doorway, the guardsman follows suit with his plasma gun.\n\nAt this point the Vindicare realizes that the other paintings are giving an unnatural smile, he puts a pistol to the woman's head and yells \"stay back, or I'll shoot her\" the start looking worried and don't fight. At this point the psyker rejoins the party. After this the Vindicare yells a phrase he heard the demons he's fought before say to the paintings, the turn towards the party. The psyker hears the yelling and since he knows demonic yells to the Vindicare, \"that means kill them all!\", it was at that point the Vindicare realized that it was the Khornates who would yell that phrase. He then points at the other paintings and repeats the phrase, the paintings then realize what he meant and started killing the other paintings. At this point I got a really good roll on my damage and ended up doing 16 damage to the paint demon, still not killing it. After that we set fire to the paintings and booked it out of there. The psyker on the way out grabbed a painting, the painting contained 2 actively crying people on it, the psyker stabbed the painting multiple times as it screamed. (OOC we were told that the painting was of the painters family)\n\nThat's where we ended the session however it was the most fun I've had in a table top session in a while.",

        "text": "* [&lt;&lt; previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/6woxiv/vtm_jalees_kamal_villain_by_proxy_part_4/)\n\nWe now return you to your irregularly scheduled Jalees.\n\nAfter Lady ST and I chatted about the particulars of the deals, we agreed on a method that would ‘fix’ them all, and would get King back into the good graces of his contacts - as long as he didn’t go back to intimidation tactics. We all sat back down at the table, and I passed King a note - an open note - “Everything is handled.” He looked at the note and nodded, saying “Okay then. King owes Edvin a Life Boon.”\n\nThe rest of the group was curious, but Lady ST started speaking. She calmly detailed over the course of the rest of the week that the press releases and language coming out of the state legislators took a radical turn. Taxes on the wealthy would increase, long time laws would be rewritten in favor of the people, more consumer protections would be put in place, salaries and bonuses of Board of Directors and C-level executives would be scrutinized and possibly regulated, and the state would begin to fund a statewide fiber network for as many as was feasible.\n\nIn short, the politicians did a complete 180 practically overnight. Their rhetoric was on point: many were convinced that this is what they wanted all along, but they had been blinded by their party lines. By the end of the week the explosion of moderate politicians was termed a third party, the ‘Gentle Moderates’. Characterized by a willingness to hear other points of view, to compromise in good faith, transparency for campaign funding and lobbying, and the ability to back up claims with reliable sources.\n\nThis was being heavily supported by the people, and heavily opposed by big businesses and the few million- and billionaires that lived in the state. Many large businesses threatened to move out of the state, labelling anything that would cost them money as “anti-business”. Fresh waves of controversy were sparked as the election cycle, which many had thought closed long ago, was reignited.\n\nThe other players looked at me, mouths agape. I responded as Edvin - “I have always been a strong supporter of the masses. Sometimes the politicians in charge need to be told what is actually best. I’ll have to get some things set up in order to keep the business lobbies at bay, but this should work out heavily in our favor.” Edvin had already called Jalees and asked for a bit of help with the whole process. Jalees had been able to set up a large loan, in the neighborhood of 7 dots of Resources - something like $50 million dollars. In addition, Edvin requested whatever help he could muster on the influence front, to help whip the businesses into shape and keep the political pressure on to radically shift the balance of power in favor of the Moderates.\n\nJohn was informed that King’s contacts had all converted as well, and had considered their deals with him fulfilled. The support had begun to flow in from them as well, several charity galas had already been planned, and he - or a representative - were expected to attend at least a few of them. Being in a state of long days, even though midsummer had passed a month previous - and being beings of the night - the galas were graciously planned for well after the sun had set. King was rather nervous about the plans, but Edvin managed to convince Thea to accompany him, on the grounds of living up to the expectation of having a lovely woman on his arm, but moreso to have Thea keep an eye on him and rein him in if necessary.\n\nAlso during the week Thea, Brain and Miser had managed to settle out the issues with the blood banks, and with the check and loan agreement that Edvin had produced they were on their way to profitability, though it would take some months to start paying back the loan. Edvin was told that Jaless had done ‘some other, related things’ to help spin the state’s politics around. \n\nHe was rather surprised to learn from the news that one of Jalees’ ghouls was running in the gubernatorial race under the flag of the Gentle Moderates. His favorite ghoul, in fact. \n\nNow that the blood banks were back on track, Edvin immediate lost interest. He gave Miser some tips on running the business end, left it in Brain’s hands to tech up the process, and went back to doing Tremere things. Edvin had been busy running around on the off nights and meeting up with the rest of the Camarilla and Anarch NPCs. There wasn’t many of the latter, and they weren’t really Anarchs - they were just… they were Camarilla, but they said they were Anarchs. Edvin was less than pleased about that, and made sure to devote some time to educating them.\n\n\nEdvin’s true goal, of course, was building dossiers on all of the resident Licks. As he did this he uncovered a series of startling revelations:  \n\n* The Camarilla of the city were high fractured, and on the whole for incredibly petty reasons. By the numbers, Edvin’s group of 5 was the largest coterie in the Domain by half again - the majority of groups were either trios or duos, and many of the older, more feral or otherwise less welcome had been solo for many moons. As an on-again, off-again Sabbat member, Edvin was deeply upset by this revelation, that some of his brothers and sisters had so small a support network. One of Edvin’s goals was now to reunite these disparate groups into - ideally - a group that would willingly convert to the Anarchs, if not directly to the Sabbat.  \n* The majority of the groups in the city were relatively powerless, and had wearily settled to play the game of prestation in order to achieve what they were after. The level of interconnectedness of the Domain based on boons was astounding, and the Harpy would regularly nullify lists of boons between parties as either a mutual absolution of debts, or as some sort of horse trading behind the scenes.  \n* Nobody outside of Edvin’s group liked the new way the state politics were heading. All of the current powers in the influence and financial sections of the city had been thrown for a massive loop, and couldn’t find the source of the change. Every time they questioned the politicians in an attempt to find the source of the changes, even the most powerful Dominate and Presence tactics are easily rebuffed and ineffective.\n\nEdvin, always curious, and especially so when it comes to things that Jalees cooks up, offered to attend to one of these politicians. The Prince was hesitant, as he had already sent several Ventrue and Brujah to question a few quietly, and openly questioned him before those few gathered at Elysium, and got hit by a nasty surprise. Edvin looked the Prince straight in the eye, and said calmly, slowly, sotto voce, “There are times at which age has its uses, Principino Santino. Do not stand here.” I did this by passing a note to Lady ST with the wording, then openly asked to roll Intimidation, and was told it wasn’t needed. Edvin was given directions to the nearest politician of interest, and responded that the fool could be brought before them all.\n\nSo he was.\n\nState Senator Armando Gurerra was brought in and sat down in a chair, and his hood removed. As his eyes adjusted to the rather bright light, his gaze swept across Edvin, and a sudden change in demeanor overcame him. He began to rant and rave, shouting that he had found the wizard, and he tried to get up and pace.\n\nI shot Lady ST a questioning look, then jotted a quote down on a note and passed it to her. She smirked, and read it aloud:  &gt;\"Wizard! I see you! I see you, wizard! I see the things that follow, those who walk before and He Who Walks Behind! They come, they come for you!\"\n\nThat got everyone’s attention, and something fierce. King started to spout nonsense about Edvin being a traitor, Thea alternated between attempting to shout King down and questioning how the politician knew Edvin’s face, Brain began a monologue as he analyzed the possible motives of the reveal, and Miser rewarded the politician with a solid thunk of unconsciousness. That action was enough to refocus the room into something less like bedlam.\n\nEdvin held up a hand, and waited for silence. “I can explain this,” he began. He then proceeded to tell the story of his last several flights from cities across the world, and why he had to sleep on and off for centuries. He was being chased, not by a who, but by a what, and what’s worse, a group of whats. He told his story of the night of the signing of the Convention  of Thorns, and how Clan Tremere had earned the permanent ire of several members of different clans. He was not at the signing as the representative of the Tremere, but nonetheless he was still there.\n\nAs he continued the story, I kept one foot in reality while simultaneously leaning over into the surreal. I told a story about being hunted in the daylight, running from shadow to shadow in heavy wools with the passing of clouds, running from birds, rats, snakes and all manner of creature. I spoke at length about running through the African savanna, outmaneuvering packs of giant wolves, blood-crazed vampires and mortal hunters. On and on Edvin spoke, recounting his flight from that which followed him. \n\nIt was beautiful. It was artful. It was definitely more than 50% lies. It was almost assuredly more than 90% lies.\n\n&gt;Edvin: “To this day I still run, though I had been gaining ground for the last few centuries. I thought I would be safe here for a few decades, until my pursuers caught up. I see that perhaps I was wrong.”  \n&gt;Prince: “But who is it, what thing could want you so badly?”  \n&gt;E: “I have narrowed that down to two possibilities: My sire, whom went a different direction during the Convention, and decided to deal with me, or a group of those my clan wronged so long ago. Whether that means Assamite, other Tremere or the long lost Salubri, I know not.”  \n&gt;King: “I thought you said that you had started the shift in politics?!”  \n&gt;Prince + Elders: “He what!”  \n&gt;E: “King, how inopportune. Your Grace, I did indeed start the shift, although I quickly realized that the scope was much larger than what I could have accomplished on my own. I had originally thought that the source was simply that my coterie had been helping me, though as I talked to my fellow Primogen I learned that that was not the case.”  \n&gt;P: “You should have come to me, Edvin, before meddling in my affairs.”  \n&gt;E: “With respect, Your Grace, the mortals are not solely your affairs, and your authority is only over the Domain as related to the safety of those in it, and the enforcement of the Traditions. I do acknowledge that I may have caused some temporary pains, which I will make myself available to alleviate.”  \n&gt;P: *sputters*  \n&gt;E: “Now, onto the issue. I can do what I can to either corral or destroy the agents of my pursuers, as I do not think them present in the city as of yet. To date they have not seemed to have interest in those around me, so I would not be unduly concerned about your own safety.”  \n\nAnd with that, Edvin left.\n\nHe had a few things to talk with Jalees about before turning in for the day.\n",

        "text": "*A letter drafted in character, to be sent in response to the neighboring town of Shimmerbrook.*\n\nGentlefolk,\n\nYour plea for aid was received in Dire Maw, but I fear we cannot offer much help as we, too, face an ocean of undead. We shall send such information as we can gather and request that you do the same, in the interest of our mutual survival.\n\nThe star that fell this past fortnight opened new passages within the local mine, drawing miners in hopes of riches. The miners fell sick, and guards dispatched to enforce a quarantine were mysteriously transformed to walking bones that then attacked inquisitive youths. Gnolls attacked an aid caravan sent with medicines and were slain, but their bodies vanished before watchmen could return to the site of the battle.\n\nYouths once again slipped out of the forewarned village to visit the site of the starfall, where they report rotting wolves and gnoll skeletons that walk and fight. The valley created by the star’s impact is surrounded on all sides by dying vegetation, and in its center shines a violet star that whispers alluring invitations to all who look on it. Hundreds of bone gnolls work tirelessly, killing beasts and throwing their corpses into the crater, where they join a sea of writhing bones.\n\nA veteran formerly serving as sergeant of the guard, Atticus Finch, has behaved suspiciously throughout recent events, and is now wanted for questioning in connection to the supernatural deaths of five of his fellow guardsmen. We fear what influence may have befallen him, and urge you to be alert to strange behavior in your own ranks.\n\nOur militia, due to recent losses, is down to twenty-one reliable fighters: The captain, four veterans, and sixteen volunteers of little training. We have in our village some 475 souls including young, elderly, and infirm persons. We can arm perhaps one-third of those with basic weapons. Walls fifteen feet high of stone and wood encircle the village center and watchtowers overlook the approaches. We are bringing in as much of the crops as we can, but fear to send people out for any time or distance. Rising panic in the village may complicate efforts to coordinate further action.\n\nWe see many paths forward, all of them bad. We believe the town will fall if faced with the army we have witnessed, much less the horde it might become. Our number have too many elderly and infirm to travel safely to Shimmerbrook, even if only living gnolls were to threaten us. Many caverns surround the village, and perhaps the villagers could be separated and hidden, but it is certain many of them would perish. An attack upon the witching star itself seems suicidal, and it is not certain that it would stem the tide that approaches.\n\nWe now have turned to desperate measures. Our matron Zola searches the records for events like these, or for places of power or artifacts nearby, while rash volunteers attempt to delve the mines and search the ruined convent of the Silent Sisters.\n\nThe boy Rogen Browd and his drake arrived safe and whole, but with little understanding of the circumstances and deep in exhaustion. We shall keep him well within town walls at least until such time as he is fully recovered, and hopefully until the pressing dangers diminish. We ask that you send a more detailed report, as circumstances allow.\n\nDire Maw",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/6wt4p0/a_rippers_resurrected_session_gone_somewhat_awry/",
        "text": "Okay, so in our Savage Worlds: Rippers Resurrected game last night, we had a pretty epic fail.\n\nSo for a little backstory, Rippers is a game that takes place primarily in Victorian London, and you play members of a secret society of monster hunters called Rippers who kill monsters and implant themselves with monster body parts, so as to become stronger to fight more monsters. This also makes you go crazy; hilarity ensues.\n\nThe characters in question are:\n\nDylan (this is my character) – Itinerant occult scholar and secret magic user who summons dark powers and uses magic based around shadow. He’s also literally exchanged hearts with a witch so… he’s pretty emo. Surprisingly the toughest in the group, as he has some demon-hide Rippertech that increases his armor rating significantly, and ALSO has the most heavily armored coat.\n\nDoctor Moore – Our psychologist and Rippertech surgeon. He’s a lame old man who hobbles with a cane. The cane is 12-gauge, single-shot. He’s also on the run from Rippers he’s wronged, and so is operating under a false identity.\n\nBartholomew – Bart was a pirate who, through events we’re still kind of learning, was saved by a Rippertech transplant of vampire lymph-nodes that made him ageless. Which is why we have a 200+-year-old pirate running around with us. That, and the combination of other weird Rippertech he’s had installed (werewolf maw, demonic viscera that lets him move super fast, etc) have made him… somewhat unstable.\n\nTombstone (u/fissionmike)– A gunslingin’, tobacco-spittin’, walkin’, talkin’ stereotype of “‘Murrika’s the best!” He’s also got Arrogance as a hindrance, so he’s done things in the past that have gotten us into trouble, because he is super committed to the character (also the player’s a bit of a troll). However, he has recently been trained by the Vatican and has gained the “Miracles” arcane background so that he can bless us and heal us, and has started to lose the Arrogance. He’s shown more character growth than anyone else in the party. Also, he haaaaaates Rippertech. He thinks that man should not need to become the monster to defeat the monster (really, it’s just ego, we’re all pretty sure, but you get the idea).\n\nAlso, our DM is u/woeg.\n\nSo, our pirate Bart has stumbled across some documents stating that there’s a huge albino crocodile harassing Belgian troops that are occupying some territory in Africa. I honestly can’t recall if we knew specifically where – we just followed the documents. So we do some research (an integral part of monster hunting in Rippers), and determine that this croc has two weaknesses. One is that it’s vulnerable to gold weapons, and one is that it’s being controlled by something or someone, who is presumably less hard to kill than a giant throwback to the Triassic period.\n\nWe travel to this small port town in Africa, and some hijinks ensue based on previous adventures. Among them, Dylan’s somehow got a zombie clone in town that’s been killing people (though nobody knows how or why) and so he gets accused of dark powers (which he DOES have… he just hasn’t used it here, so he is somewhat perplexed).\n\nDylan gets run out of town. Bart runs away from Dylan’s clone (who he just killed for presumably at least a second time) and a bed full of snakes. We’ve all had bad experiences at this point with snakes, and things that hold snakes, so we all agreed that a snake-holdin’ bed was a good thing to get gone from. \n\nDoctor Moore has occasionally been possessed by the ghost of Jack the Ripper (he and Dylan kind of trade of that particular joy), and so he harbors… some ill will regarding prostitutes. However, he is a psychologist and a man of science, and so he makes it a point to visit brothels and offer medical care to the girls (and presumably boys, if any were there). Tombstone goes with him, but instead of his first use of Vatican-trained miraculous power to bless this doctor to heal the sick, he curses the doctor to make his healing less effective. \nBecause I reckon the Good Lord don’t take kindly to free medical care for those too unfortunate to afford it on the free market.\n\nThe DM is very specific to ask Tombstone’s player what his goal is with this and why he’s attempting to curse an ally who is performing a selfless act. And Tombstone’s response is “Because he called me ‘the help’ and I wanna fuck with him.” Newfound faith in action, you guys. However, God being who he is, Tombstone gets a blinding pain in his head and his power fizzles.\n\nSo around the time Tombstone gets a holy headache and Doctor Moore sees to the downtrodden, Dylan gets run outta town (and it took a few good persuasion rolls to prevent worse from happening). Tombstone and Bart go looking for Dylan. They stumble across a wolf made of shadows and proceed to freak the fuck out. In retrospect, it may have been a good idea for Dylan to tell his teammates about this new shape-changing ability ahead of time.\n\nDylan turns back into himself and tries to calm them down, which doesn’t work out super well, given that Bart has just re-killed one Dylan already. However, he manages to convince them it’s him with knowledge of their adventures together. At this time, Doctor Moore arrives and advises the group that he found a ceremonial spear with a gold spearhead (just-the-tip jokes begin and do not end for the remainder of the night) and the vendor also provided Moore with a box, saying “I was told to give this to someone with the skilled hands to use it.” In the box are a gold scalpel and a silver scalpel, and the inscription “JD”, which are the initials of Jack the Ripper’s actual identity (SPOILER FOR THOSE WHO DON’T KNOW THIS AND CARE, REGARDING THE RIPPERS SETTING… it’s John Dee).\n\nMoore also met a man named Nicunda who is a villager and was willing to guide us to where the big albino crocodile was supposedly laired up. In return, we would work with his village to prevent abuse from local Belgian forces, who have been tormenting and enslaving them.\n\nSo we start hiking through the jungle to Nicunda’s village, and stumble across a Belgian boat that has been washed up onto the trail from a nearby river, due to seasonal flooding. In it are a box of rusty and useless Belgian rifles, a box of rusty and useless bayonets, and a box of questionable ammunition. Dylan takes the one semi-usable rifle and 3 full magazines worth of ammunition. We continue on the trail to the village, and celebrate with the welcoming guests before going to sleep. Doctor Moore offers medical aid and heals quite a few of them, in fact helping a man who was believed permanently lame to walk again, etc. It went a long way toward the villagers’ goodwill, and belief in our capabilities.\n\nThe next day, we are woken up by shouting in Belgian. We awake to a Belgian officer and his sergeant shouting into the village, demanding to speak to the village headman. Dylan turns into a shadow-crow and flies out of a window to get an aerial view. Tombstone and Doctor Moore go to speak to the Belgians, while Bart stays in bed, nursing a hangover from the local equivalent of fermented goat’s milk.\n\nTurns out all the villagers have left the village and are hiding, and the Belgians have the village surrounded, and are accusing the villagers of having assaulted Belgian forces. Moore and Tombstone attempt to persuade the officer to leave the villagers alone, and suddenly Nicunda is captured and brought into the village. Tombstone and Doctor Moore, and the now-blearily-awake Bart, attempt to persuade the officer that Nicunda is merely there as our guide to hunt a giant albino crocodile. Doctor Moore presents logical arguments, Tombstone presents emotional appeals, and Bart argues in his chaotic fashion about how we got dinosaur-huntin’ to do. Presumably you can see why they seemed hesitant to believe us.\n\nHowever, something you should know about Rippers – Characters, and some powerful NPC’s, are “wild cards”, and get to roll a D6 in addition to any other roll or die type they have to make. So Doctor Moore and Tombstone both roll their persuade on this and fail abysmally. However, the officer is also a Wild Card, and so he rolls his Spirit to see if he’s convinced, and gets to roll two dice.\n\nHe rolls fucking snake-eyes, you guys. Snake-eyes is bad. Snake-eyes isn’t “he fails, so he absolutely believes you.” Snake-eyes is “he doesn’t believe you, until a giant white shape erupts from the edge of the river with a thunderous bellow, and a massive maw snaps closed on one of the Belgian troops before immediately vanishing into the river again with nary a ripple.  There is a stunned silence for several moments.”\n\nIn short, we convinced him. Tombstone managed to convince him that it’d be much easier to “occupy” the area if they were cordial and cooperative with the natives (that’s that character growth I mentioned earlier), rather than oppressive, and Bart managed to secure shiny new Belgian rifles, reliable ammunition, and further food and supplies, to aid in our mission.\n\nSo, the Belgians agree to leave the villagers alone, but will be “forced” to take them into “custody” if we don’t return with proof of the crocodile’s death in three days time. Nicunda is released into our care, and we make our way onward.\n\nWe continue up the river. The next day, we come to a lake, are suddenly beset by three crocodiles. These are normal, and so only mildly terrifying. However, something else you need to know about the mechanics we run; the DM uses these action cards from some other game, and we each get one at the beginning of the session, and we can possibly earn more throughout the night but we can only SPEND one per session.\n\nSo we’re fighting these crocs, and Dylan rolls to shoot one, and fails pretty badly. However, he spends his action card, called “erratic behavior”. There are several descriptions on this of what could happen, but Dylan chooses “a failure somehow becomes a success”. \n\nSo, it was determined that Dylan’s shooting roll was so bad that he accidentally grabbed the crappy rifle he found originally, instead of the good one he’d recently been given, off of his back. When he attempts to fire, the barrel jams and explodes, shrapnel flying out and hitting the crocodile, along with the bullets. Damage was rolled as standard for the rifle, and did enough damage to kill the croc in one blow. \n\nThe rest of the crocs were handled similarly, if less dramatically, and we continued on to the lake. A storm began to arise, and while you might think this is dramatic tension, it was actually done because Bart used his action card to negatively affect our mission (something along the lines of “your search is impeded”) which made it harder to track what we were looking for. By spending his card to negatively affect his goals, he gained two bennies, which are similar to fate points or action points in other systems. You can spend them to negate a penalty, to re-roll a failed roll, etc. Notably, the DM has bennies he can spend throughout the night, and Wild Card NPC’s have them as well. The Belgian officer couldn’t use his because you can’t spend a Benny on snake-eyes. Snake-eyes fuckin’ suck, yall.\n\nSo eventually we find ruins of a temple. The statuary, etc, resemble other things we’ve seen in Afghanistan, England, etc, so this is clearly part of the larger plot. However, we begin to hear drumming, and then a large albino crocodile erupts from where it’d hidden under some undergrowth… behind us.\n\nTombstone, guns a-blazin, almost takes the croc’s head off immediately. Like, he lays into that thing with holy, righteous, leaden fury. He and Bart take up the task of destroying the crocodile, while Dylan and the good doctor run (or in the doctor’s case, limply hobble along, slowly and lamely… he’s got a bad leg, is what I’m sayin’. He’s not fast.) into the temple to find where the drumming is coming from.\nIt should be noted that, as long as that drumming is going on, the croc is regenerating each round. We CANNOT kill it until we get this controller. \n\nDylan and the doctor eventually arrive in the main room in the temple and find the witch-doctor. Dylan holds his action, and is able to dispel the attack that the witchdoctor casts at them. Doctor Moore unloads 12 gauges of “fuck you” into the witchdoctor and, more importantly, his drum. \n\nThe beast outside, now out of control, is operating with less human intelligence, but more animal instinct. It kills Tombstone.\nIt was literally that fast. It bit the FUCK out of Tombstone, one-shotted him. And then he failed his vigor check, so he immediately bleeds out. It is the end of the ‘Murrikan dream, you guys. \n\nDoctor More began looking through the book for what Rippertech parts we could harvest from a Martyr. So, silver lining.\n\nBut! What’s this? Doctor Moore spends his card, which is something along the lines of “For Glory!” on Tombstone’s behalf. It’s a Hail Mary. So Tombstone and the DM go outside to talk while the rest of us figure out what we’re going to do. \n\nThey come back in, and they’re both grinning ear to ear. So; next round. The witchdoctor unloads a spell at Doctor Moore… and drops him. One-shot.  He at least makes his vigor check, so he doesn’t bleed out, but he’s out of the combat. And he’s already spent his card for Tombstone, so that won’t bring him back.\n\nDylan manages to kill the witchdoctor with a blast of darkness and shadow, and coup de grâce him, but we’ve already determined that his death isn’t the end of the croc… we’ve got to kill this thing.\n\nSo, outside, Bart takes the golden spear and charges the crocodile. This was a very Moby Dick moment… our mad pirate finally getting to stab at the great white beast he’s been hunting that nobody believes in the existence of. It was very cathartic, and we were all super stoked for him to finally go bananas with his Rippertech and a golden spear on this bastard lizard.\n\nBart misses. The gator bites Bart… and one-shots him. I’m not making this up you guys… it bites Bart, damn near in half, and hurls him like a chew-toy… toward Tombstone’s corpse.\n\nAnd here’s the Hail Mary, guys. Tombstone’s spirit rises from his corpse like the fucking Undertaker. His spirit, glowing white, rises from his corpse. Incandescent wings burst from his shoulders, and he catches Bart’s flying corpse. A beatific expression on his face, Saint Tombstone looks down and smiles in Bart’s dying face, says “Fight the good fight”, and Tombstone makes his “healing” roll. His normal roll, which is a d4, is currently a d12+2, because he is empowered by the will of the Divine, Our Father, the Lord God Almighty, and all the forces of life and creation are at this moment being channeled through this one act of will and self-sacrifice.\n\nFucking. Snake-eyes.\n\nI don’t know if you guys recall how bad that is. Snake-eyes is not “well that sucks.” It’s “Welp, I’m fucked.”\n\nSo, Bart does NOT heal. What DOES happen, is ALL of Bart’s Rippertech catches fire. INSIDE HIS BODY.\n\nSo his werewolf maw bursts into flame. His vampire lymphnodes burst into flame. His demonic viscera bursts into flame. He does make his vigor roll to not bleed out, but at this point he almost should not have bothered. He never even got to use the bite attack or extra actions from those mods.\n\nSo Dylan, our squishy caster who has ALWAYS gotten the shit end (Bart once exploded a sword into Dylan’s dick, you guys… he’s got BAD luck) is left alone to face this essentially uninjured and very angry dinosaur.\n\nHowever, the witchdoctor is dead, and the croc is enraged so it’s not running away. Dylan may not be a huge badass, but neither is he an idiot. So, discretion being the better part of valor, Dylan turns into a shadow raven and flies up into the trees, out of range of the croc’s stubby little legs. He takes the high ground. And he just keeps blasting shadows at this enraged crocstrosity until it dies to death.\n\nThe wizard survived, y’all. And without a scratch on him. I need a moment to let that sink in myself.\n\nDylan turns into a bird again and flies back to the village to get the villagers to help, and comes back to gather up his homies, who are stable, and Tombstone’s corpse. \n\nThe witch-doctor’s corpse is gone. This is not the first time, and it won’t be the last, that this freakin’ happens. We’ll be seeing him again. \n\nWe all get on Tombstone’s magic carpet (long story, and it really belongs to all of us, but he refused to admit that for some reason) and fly back to our lodge in London, and proceed to divide up his loot. I’m sure we’ll miss him, at some point. ",

        "author": "Hoshino_Yumemi",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/6wt2d5/battletech_megamek_rookie_mistakes_episode_i_i/",
        "text": "I have the habit of arriving late to things I totally fall in love with, and tabletop games are one of those things. Take Battletech, for example - I was one of the unlucky saps who got into the game through Mechassault, an inside joke for Battletech fans released on the original Xbox. Hell, I thought it was just Mechwarrior video games. I didn’t know what a rich universe I’d be diving into when web client thing Megamek would remove the barriers of cost and actually trying to find players in my area, and when one of my best friends would take me under his wing to learn the game I would gain a skilled teacher whose general understanding of tactics and broader strategy would give me a fast track towards being good at the game and telling stories about war, really.\n\nHowever, that was a long time ago at the time of this story...and to be honest it’s still a long way off now. For now, I have stories to tell on exactly what dumb stuff I did when I had no idea what I was doing.\n\nOne of my other introductions to the broader Battletech universe was Mechwarrior Online, which I was in for kind of from the beginning...and I suppose that's all I really want to say about that now, as things turned out. From there, I got a taste for fast-moving heavy mechs and nimble medium mechs, mostly because lights weren’t to my liking due to my aggression and assault mechs (heavier than heavy, basically) were big and meaty, but also bigger targets and really slow. From there, I had ideas in my head on how to do Battletech combat: dictate the line of battle by finding an offensive point and scrambling to it first, force my opponent to react to me, and for that I need to be fast and do direct damage quickly.\n\nThen I got a wrinkle from my friend: six units, at least two of them vehicles, since Battletech of course lets you play with tanks, powered armor, infantry...anything, really. I could understand the other limits he’d set for me: we’d be doing skirmishes with a certain Battle Value (every unit has a score based on all parameters of its performance; don’t go over a certain total score for your units deployed), and don’t go over a certain total tonnage (self-explanatory, but as we will see, bigger isn’t exactly better in Battletech). Total monetary cost on the other hand was no object, so with those limits I went off and built my forces from the catalog of every official book of units ever printed, along with a few customs put in by the devs. Nothing crazy though, I wasn’t about to cheat and neither was my friend.\n\nHe’d done his usual bang-up job, taking bigger mechs and lighter vehicles. I, on the other hand, had done the opposite, like I said - I’d make a run for the battle line of my choosing, and thanks to having more than 160 tons of weight to work with with my medium and light-heavy mechs, I took two big, fat tanks known as Demolishers.\n\nBattletech fans and longtime players will already know what fresh hell I’ve conjured for myself, but to the uninitiated, take a main battle tank and feed it steroids before stripping it of anything that makes a main battle tank usable in the real world, such as speed and the ability to hit anything that’s out of a range officially classified by military experts as “might as well throw shells by hand.”\n\nWhy, you ask? Who in their right mind would outweigh an Abrams by 20 tons to put two derpguns in a big ice cream scoop of a turret? Because those guns are huge. They’re AC/20s, automatic cannons which strip off 20 hit points from a single location if they hit, one 180+mm shell at a time. Putting two in a turret and hoping they hit the same location is a way to completely destroy that component and one-shot anything up to the bulkiest assault mechs. I wouldn’t know this until this skirmish, but they’re also a good way to suddenly do the 20+ damage needed to stand a chance of flinging a mech clean off its feet if it survives having a small battleship shell slammed into it. If my heavy flankers were meant to draw the battle line with a mixture of speed, bulk and firepower, these would come crashing through the door and push back a direct offensive.\n\n...which my new teacher used assault mechs for, and took small medium tanks that I immediately underestimated, not knowing those were his flankers. Plus, while Battlemechs are fancy, what with the ability to carry gadgets like jump jets, huge banks of weapons and neat tactics that work in the Mechwarrior games as well as they do in Battletech, like torso twisting to direct damage away from more critical areas, tanks are direct. They’re tough and mobile, and they’re cheap. The little mediums could easily ruin my day, which I wasn’t quite ready for…\n\n...but I wasn’t quite ready for my own Behemoths to ruin my battle just as easily. Actually, a lot of things went wrong in very short order, and the Behemoths were just part of the hilarious domino rally that was my baptism by futuristic Three Stooges sequence.\n\nSee, one of my first problems was not properly casing the map we’d chosen, because in one fell swoop I’d made things infinitely harder for myself by having my mechs advance in two-mech elements running up the sides of the map, alongside buildings. My thought was that the buildings would be a way to break line of sight and spring myself on my friend’s flanks. In reality, I didn’t have the mech firepower and my tanks didn’t have the speed. This version of Five Nights At Kerensky’s involved Star Colonel Foxy being an arthritic and noisily wheezing his way down the hall before stopping to suck wind, and with no way to maneuver or create properly intersecting fields of fire, all my advantages from speed were gone since to one side was building and the other was mech-sized alleyways. With no elevation to work with and very little forest to break line of sight with, I was trapped in the open with mechs stomping to a frontline very rapidly collapsing on me.\n\nWith my mechs out of position and my tanks not up to the job of mounting a pursuit, my friend’s tanks started needling at me and forcing me to pick targets, and with him using his leftover tonnage for heavier mechs built for deciding the frontline, I needed to rush forward with the slowest things on the map, make a heroic advance that could easily punch a hole clean through a heavy mech if Lady Luck was on my side, and that’s when the Behemoths decided to drop their pants.\n\nWell, their legs, really: one of my doofy future KV-2s got mobility-killed by a shot to the treads, immobilizing it and turning it into a fixed fortification. But it was okay, I still had a turret and...two guns that had none of the range to do any good as a bunker of some kind. As for the other guy, he was well out of position and bravely contributing bugger all to the fight, so my best chance became trying to park the next guy by his beached comrade to funnel the fight back to an ad-hoc defensible position while I got in the way of my own brilliant plan by initiating melee with my friend’s mechs. All I could think to do was knock the other mechs over because I’d completely lost faith in blasting my opponents at range at this point.\n\nThere wasn’t much else to say about that battle except that I got some licks in before finally being ground down, mostly due to pushing and shoving other mechs over so they could take damage from falling over, then from their pilots failing to get them back up and falling back over to take more damage. Eventually an internal component will get busted and ammo will eventually cook off from the damage, and if you don’t have a neat gadget called CASE, or its big-budget sequel, CASE II (screenplay by Joss Whedon), all that damage will probably blow the target to crap and then some. That’s how I got my first kills, essentially by watching as my enemies haplessly beat themselves to death. It’s the glamour that makes mech commanders so celebrated, isn’t it?\n\nThis set a precedent for my command style. I forget the name of the tank I’d used next, but as my training proceeded, I decided to switch to tanks that used the super long-range, hard-hitting Gauss Rifle, and that was only because if I got tracked, I’d at least have the range to threaten a larger area.\n\nWhich was prophetic, because like clockwork I’d managed to get that stupid thing tracked too, but worse this time, as I’d gotten it stuck on the rear lines, all out of position like a true newbie. I got beaten a second time, but that was when I figured I’d had it with tanks for a while. But not with vehicles…\n\nSee, my big break finally came with hovercraft. Fast, aggressive flankers, practically tailor-built for my style. I was always curious after seeing the wiki entry for the obscenely-fast Gabriel scout hovercraft, but this was no dinky five-ton race car: these were Bandits, 50-ton combat hovercraft made by Wolf’s Dragoons, who were really Clan Wolf, and so knew what they were doing when putting these things together.\n\nIt was a dream, and my first of my precious few victories...well, with a catch. See, hovercraft are annoying in their own adorable way, which is that whenever you try to drive them really fast and make sudden turns, they’ll have a chance to skid and in their spinning-out state they spend that turn out of position. Nothing bad, unless you’re trying to carefully choreograph a plan, which is why I went for simple and robust: flank, surround and show my teacher I was nothing if not a good student. I haven’t gone back to tanks yet, but hovercraft remain an essential part of my fighting style on the rare occasions I have a chance to play. My schedule’s filled with other games by now.\n\nI have other stories about my misadventures in Battletech, and this is just the first. Everything about this, really, just goes to show one important thing, which is that beginner’s luck ain’t always good. There’s just no way of telling in your first games or whatnot if what you’re doing is a good idea or a bad one, which is why it’s beginner’s luck, now isn’t it? Once you get into the swing of things, you graduate to making your own luck…\n\n...uhhh...good or bad, as this little series will attest.",

King and Thea would ask Edvin about various historical events, and Edvin would answer as if he had attended the event (usually he had, in one way or another). Brain and Edvin, with the occasional help from Miser, would be the group’s thinktank and investigators. Miser was beginning to have his own problems, stemming from his interactions with mortals, but not having the Presence Discipline in-clan, and having to learn it from either King - who was not interested in teaching him - or Thea - who didn’t have much to teach.\n\nMiser was also in charge of ensure that the coterie had enough clean blood in supply to cover their basic needs. Each Lick takes one point to wake each night, and some discipline powers cost one or more to activate. Thaumaturgy is particularly costly - any path usage is (at least) one point, and most rituals are 1-3 points each. Lately there had been some problems with the blood banks and mortal cults that Miser ran in an attempt to keep the blood flowing to the group.\n\nThis problem came to a head at the start of the third game, when we were informed that we were all down 3 blood from lack of feeding. Eyes turned to Miser, and he began to stammer apologies and excuses, but quickly stopped as he attempted to fade away. Edvin grabbed him and kept hold of him, moving him around forcefully when he attempted to Obfuscate.\n\n&gt;Miser: “I had to shut down some of the blood banks because they weren’t making enough money to keep themselves open. The cults are fine, but there are only so many people that those sorts of things attract.”  \n&gt;King: “The blood banks weren’t profitable, so you shut them down? You didn’t ask for help?”  \n&gt;M: “Profitable? [silly], they weren’t even close to breaking even. I noted it on the monthly reports for the past three months that some were being closed at the end of this month.”  \n&gt;K: “Does anybody even read those?”  \n&gt;Brain: “I do spot checks.”  \n&gt;Thea: “I don’t get them.”  \n&gt;Edvin, feeling a pressure building behind his eyes: “Okay! Let’s see if we can pool some money together and at least keep them up past the end of the month. King and Thea, that’s your part. Brain and I will go through the books with Miser and see if we can’t help him streamline the cash flow.”  \n\nThis threw Lady ST for a loop - she paused a moment and looked off to the side while scratching her cheek with her thumb. I’d guess that she expected us to do something more short term, and then deal with the decrease later. A strong, clean blood supply was too important to Edvin to let any changes go unchallenged or unchecked.\n\nI took one of my prepared notes that started “What does Brain think” and finished it with “went wrong with the blood banks?” and passed it over to Dilton. He thought about it for a long time, and wrote simply: “Further information required.” At least Dilton could stick to his character.\n\nLady ST had finished thinking and asked who should get focus first. I suggested that Edvin, Brain and Miser go first, because they would need to find out the information they needed, and then the players would have to figure out how to fix the problems as much as the characters would. The camera could swing back after the initial bit, and we’d have plenty of time to think of solutions.\n\nKing, in a rare moment of non-narcissistic thought, agreed. The whole table gave him a look, and shrugged.\n\nAfter Miser returned with the books - actual, physical books - at which both Brain and Edvin sighed, the trio dove into converting from physical to digital, and finding or writing a program to help them sort through all of the data and transform it into something more reasonable to dig through. Brain held the keyboard, with coding help from Edvin, while Edvin and Miser went through the books and entered them into a spreadsheet for later consumption. While Brain went through and categorized, filtered, sorted and otherwise massaged the numbers, Edvin helped Miser remember the correct answers to questions about suppliers, salaries, payments and such with a gentle touch of Dominate(3).\n\nAfter several hours, they came up with several holes into which money was disappearing. The largest were long overdue debts from several of the local hospitals, although the most out of place was the crazy salaries of a few of the board members. There was one location that continued to have problems with staff turnover, and another that had an issue of disappearing supplies. These major problems, coupled with general inefficiencies and lack of training, had caused the four of the seven blood banks to operate in the red for months. Brain set about thinking of a program to ponder how to maximize profits without being profit-oriented, and Edvin and Miser sat down for a heart-to-heart.\n\nMeanwhile, back at the ranch, a phrase which here means “the camera swung to the other group”, King and Thea were planning and plotting, and possibly scheming. King was relatively convinced that between the two they could get enough people signed on to do a charity event to raise money for the blood banks, at least short term. Thea was decidedly less convinced, but could not think of any other ideas, and so resigned to play along with the charity ball.\n\nThe real problem with this plan was that King had forgotten the nature of his relationship with most of his contacts - negative. King relied on blackmail, threats, overt or covert pressure, or otherwise being not nice. As King began to go through his Rolodex and contact people, he was continually hitting walls based on the fact. He started to call people he knew that he hadn’t been strong-arming and got a similar response. The local high class had decided that they had held up their ends of the bargain long enough, and if he couldn’t hold up his end their deal was finished.\n\nWhen Thea asked about what sort of ‘deals’ he had been making without their knowledge, King admitted that there were a few things that had “perhaps fallen through the cracks of night-to-night life”. The whole table had a groan for that one. It was about this time of the night when Edvin and Co. had uncovered what had been messing with the numbers, and relayed the information to King and Thea. Thea then relayed their progress, and we all took a moment to drink that in. King was “disgusted at the gross mismanagement of funds” while the rest of us gave him a steady look about his 10 deals ( of 12 ) that he had failed to follow up on.\n\nEdvin and Brain put their heads together and came up with a temporary solution - a loan from Edvin’s friends in the Old Country. It would be enough to cover them for a couple of months, but they would have to pay it back on time - or else. The long term solution would be to button up the leaks and then carefully monitor the situation over the next few weeks to gather information to improve the processes of the businesses…\n\nAt this point, Edvin may have lost the others with his rather impressive buzzwords.\n\nKing cut the rambling short and said that he would take Thea around to the board members with the crazy salaries and convince them to take a rather large pay cut ( 70 to 90 percent ). Edvin calmly reminded him that few would agree to that out of hand, and to be careful and positive - no threats, no blackmail, no intimidation. King’s only response was “I’ll do what I can.” Edvin noted that he would have to do follow-ups with those board members, and wrote off King’s efforts right then. King then tried to bully Brain and Miser into helping him finish out his ends of the deals, so that he could leverage his contacts again.\n\nIt went over like congealed slop.\n\nBrain started shouting about how King never helped any of them with personal business, and had “dug his hole his own [dang] self”. Miser did not have anything specific to say, simply “NO!”. Edvin, somewhat to his own surprise, agreed - with conditions. For every deal that Edvin made right, King owes him a boon based on the amount of effort it took to correct the issue.\n\n&gt;Edvin: “Or, if you don’t like the piecemeal nature of that arrangement, here’s a simpler one: You owe me a Life Boon, and I’ll fix all of the deals in a week.”  \n&gt;*Table gasps*  \n&gt;King: “No, fixing all of those deals isn’t worth that to me.”  \n&gt;E: “Really? Not being able to utilize any of your contacts and being our primary high society interface… that means you’re pretty useless to the coterie. Sounds dangerous for our well being. Since we know that you don’t hold your word with mortals, and you’re so concerned with me lying, perhaps thou doth protest too much?”  \n&gt;K: “I understand what you’re saying, and [flick] you. I don’t have to give a flying [flick] about the cattle, and you I don’t [flicking] like.”  \n&gt;E: “You are detrimental to the coterie, and liable to get us all into trouble. This is my official warning. Get your shit together, or you’re out.”  \n&gt;K: “You can’t [flicking] do that, Eddie. I let you into this coterie, and I’ll [dang] well kick you out.”  \nThea: “Wrong. We all agreed to accept him, and we’d all have to agree to remove him.”  \n&gt;E: “I was wondering what the actual process was. In that case, I’d like to call a vote to remove King from the coterie… ”  \n\nAnd this is where I did something special. I winked towards Trev and Dilton. I’m not sure if it helped, but I got what I wanted.\n\n&gt;E: “temporarily - for one week, or until he has corrected his deals with the mortals and won back their favor, whichever happens last. His current position in the mortal circles is tenuous, and may lead to breaking the Masquerade, which would affect us all. I vote yea.”  \n&gt;T: “Your reasoning is sound, but I don’t like leaving one of our own alone.”  \n&gt;E: “My offer of aid still stands. He will only be truly alone if he chooses it.”  \n&gt;T: “... I vote yea.”  \n&gt;K: “You what? You miserable little -”  \n&gt;Brain: “I vote yea.”  \n&gt;Miser: “I don’t like it, but you have your chance at redemption. I vote yea.”  \n&gt;E: “Your membership has been revoked, and can be regained as agreed. Godspeed, King.”  \n\nLady ST was shocked. Sabrina was shocked. John was a bit defeated at this point. He sulked for a bit, then loudly announced he was going out for a smoke. I asked to join him. I got the weirdest of looks around the table, but he didn’t say no. We stepped out onto the back porch and had a brief chat. It went something like this:\n\n&gt;John: “That was low.”  \n&gt;Me: “It was necessary.”  \n&gt;J: “How do you figure?”  \n\nI had two ways of going about this - either I explain how the group has been feeling about his personality, or I act like it was a ruse because I needed King to be an outsider for a while. I opted for a bit of both.\n\n&gt;M: “King is too used to getting his way, and [dang] the consequences. Not only did Edvin not appreciate being called a liar on his first night in town, he was pretty angry about how King runs roughshod around town and leaves it to the rest of the group to clean up his mistakes.”  \n&gt;J: “I’m just playing the character, man. No reason to split the game up about it.”  \n&gt;M: “Who said anything about splitting the game? I tried to give you an out. King needs to learn his lesson - and Edvin doesn’t much care how.”  \n&gt;J: “A Life Boon is pretty serious [silly] though. Justify that.”  \n&gt;M: “Easy. Would you rather have 10 Boons mixed between Minor, Major and Blood, or a single Life Boon?”  \n&gt;J: “Okay, easy point. How would he get through 10 things in a week, though? That’s a crazy promise.”  \n&gt;M: “That’d be something I’d work out with Lady ST. It’s a good story, and I think she appreciates good stories.”  \n&gt;J: “That she does. Alright, I’ll have King give the Life Boon. That was a pretty good box you made for him.”  \n\nIt was a rare moment, to have John grounded. There was a glimmer of hope that maybe I could break him of his narcissism, at least during games. It did not last.\n\n&gt;J: “And that means that you’ll have Edvin vote him back in, right? That’s only fair.”  \n&gt;M: “The terms are what they are. One week, or until King fixes his [silly].”  \n&gt;J: “That’s not what you said. I’ll talk to the others about this.”  \n&gt;M: “That is something you can do.”  \n\nJohn had finished his smoke, and I asked if he would kindly send Lady ST out. I wanted to talked with her about the deals while game was paused anyways. We had an enlightening chat.\n",

        "text": "Tl;dr - DMs collaborate and blind-side a character with both an anti-climactic side- villain death, and an emotional bitch slap because backstory and wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey stuff.\n\nMy current DM was running two groups through different versions of the same homebrew campaign. Our group had some trouble meeting over the summer, so DM decides to do a cross-over game. He brings three of his players into my group's world, and we have a JJ Abrams or Dan Harmon level of fuckery going on with the timeline.\n\nIn this cross-over session, my group learns first that different timelines exist, and second that ours is the far darker timeline. True evil still exists in the world, the rightful leader of the Northern Kingdoms was killed in an event that started a continental war, and the main god in the world is dying.\n\nWe bond with the new characters who aid us in our quest to collect the McGuffin and our DM realizes that while his first party's rogue (Skadus) was wronged by pirates in the past, and left for dead; my character (Hjalmund) was a pirate (Sergeant at Arms) before becoming a Cleric after his ship was destroyed by a monster from the abyss.\n\nSo he contacts me, knowing that I also DM and can be pretty cruel with manipulating a backstory. At first we think Hjalmund will be the illegitimate son of the Pirate who killed Skadus' family and marooned him on an island. Then DM suggests that, in the alternate universe, my ship was never destroyed, I never faced a monster from the abyss, I never washed up on the shore near a monastery, and instead became Captain of the ship I served on.\n\nWe talked about how things would work when we eventually merged the campaigns because my group got too unreliable to game with regularly, and decided that when Hjalmund came into the world, there was a time-paradox of some sort that resulted in the pirate version dying of a heart attack.\n\nAt the end of this session, we fly on a dragon's back to an island and see a ship on the shore. Skadus and Hjalmund immediately recognize the ship, and Skadus charges onto the deck interrogating the first person he finds (a cabin boy) about the Captain. Hjalmund is dumbfounded to see his old crew's ship in working order, and wanders onto the deck out of nostalgia.\n\nAs Hjalmund comes into view, the cabin boy looks up and joyfully exclaims, \"Captain!?\" and all Skadus could say for the next couple minutes was, \"Fuck you both!\"\n\nEdit: punctuation an unnecessary clauses",

        "text": "Let's take a ride back in time (about 25 years), to when a 386 could do good-looking 3D space combat with great frame rates, through the clever use of 2D sprites.  I had ripped through Wing Commander, and was killing it in the Secret Missions add-on, when the third mission in the Jotunheim system stopped me cold.  (Don't worry about names or jargon; I'll explain whatever's relevant.)\n\nSpirit and I were flying Raptors.  Raptors were the second best Confederation fighter craft:  Heavily armored and their weapons packed a wallop, but their low maneuverability was a liability in a dogfight.  Every wingman (basically the player's NPC henchman) had their own flying style, and by that point, there was no one I would rather have as my wingman than Spirit:  She was great at keeping enemy fighters off my tail (even if she did get knocked about quite a bit), leaving me free to go full offense on the hated Kilrathi enemy.\n\nThe mission started off with a properly tough fight:  Four Gratha, the most dangerous Kilrathi fighter craft, well armed and armored.  After we beat them, we faced four Jalthi.  Jalthi hit very hard, but aren't that maneuverable.  We wiped them up, but by this time Spirit had taken significant damage.  We proceeded to the location of the Confederation distress call that was the reason for the mission, only to be ambushed by a captured Confederation capital ship, the Gwenhyvar, supported by four Rapiers.  Surprise!  (Okay, not a huge surprise:  It had been foreshadowed.  As in, \"There's a legend about a ship named the Gwenhyvar that got captured intact by the Kilrathi...\" or some such.)\n\nSo the Kilrathi were flying Rapiers, the single best Confederation fighter, which could fly circles around our Raptors while sporting weapons from hell and \"God's own shields\".  Spirit was ripped to shreds in the first few seconds, and with all of them subsequently concentrating fire on me, I didn't last much longer.\n\n*Huh*, I though.  *There's a surprisingly hard mission.*\n\nSo I loaded my saved game, and tried again.  Spirit died in the battle against the Jalthi, and I lost to the Rapiers.\n\nReload.  Die.  Reload.  Die.  Repeat many, many times.  (There were probably breaks for school and meals in there somewhere.)\n\nReload.  Finally, I killed all the Rapiers, then blew up the Gwenhyver.  Yes, I could do it!  Spirit was still dead, though, and my Raptor was limping.  On the way home, four more Grathas finished the job.  Not that I would have saved the game with Spirit dead, in any case.\n\nBut hey, now that I knew I could defeat the four Rapiers and the capital ship, I figured I could save Spirit by doing the mission alone.  I started the mission, and commanded her to go home.  She refused to leave my side.  Damn it, Spirit!\n\nSo I kept trying.  Sometimes we both died, and sometimes only Spirit died.  On a good run, I could beat the four tough Gratha after the Gwenhyver, and then only had to mop up four wimpy Krants, heavy Kilrathi fighters with such weak weapons that they would have taken minutes to kill me if I'd cut the engines and just sat there.  But continuing the game without Spirit was just not in the cards:  The characters have continuing conversations/cutscenes that I didn't want to miss, and for all I knew, I would need Spirit as a wingman again later.  (Wingmen were assigned and rotated, but if the one you would have been assigned was dead, then you didn't get a wingman.)\n\nFinally, one magical time (probably 3:00 AM after a week of this), the first four Gratha damaged Spirit badly enough that, before proceeding to the next combat, she acquiesced to my order to go home!  Alone, I made short work of the Jalthi, flawlessly killed all four Rapiers and the Gwenhyver (just imagine a woodchuck tearing apart a pack of coyotes), took apart the last four Gratha while filing my nails, casually offed three of the weak Krants, started pursuing the last remaining Krant, and watched in satisfaction as it made a classic mistake.\n\nSometimes, a pursued Kilrathi fighter will try to shake you by stopping (because you can totally just stop in space), then turning ninety degrees, and gunning it.  When you see this coming, the response is an \"afterburner slide\":  You hit the afterburners to get yourself moving quickly toward their current location, then cut the throttle and turn in the same direction they did.  As they take off in their new course, you end up right behind them, with your guns positioned to send neutron-flavored death right up their tailpipe.\n\nSo I started my afterburner slide, reveling in the fact that I was about to finally conquer this mission once and for all.\n\nThat \"stop, turn, and gun it\" maneuver I just described?  Well, about one in twenty times that Kilrathi pilots do this, they seemingly forget to \"gun it,\" and just sit there like a deer in the headlights, waiting to get killed.  Guess what that bastard did this time, of all times.  I had about a tenth of a second to realize that I was headed, at full afterburner speed in a ship that maneuvered like a tractor, straight toward an unmoving heavy fighter, before we collided in a spectacular explosion.\n\nThat was it.  I was done.  All that hard work lead up to the perfect run, which was ruined by horrible chance and the weakest enemy in the whole mission.  I quit the game, and didn't touch it for a month.\n\nEventually, I got over my frustration, and figured, \"What the hell; it's a great game.  I'll give it another chance.\"  I then beat the mission (including saving Spirit) on my first try.\n\nFrickin' weird.",

        "text": "Here's a short story from a friend of mine.\n\nWhen I and my friends aren't in some tabletop game, we're often playing with characters and settings in freeform.\n\nOne of my best friends had a little encounter in a story I hardly remember, mostly because he never told me all the details. None of them are important except this bit, after all.\n\nSo, he was overseeing some dudes who decided they were going to be playing insurgents, or terrorists, or something of that sort. Irregulars with technicals (pickup trucks playing APC, basically) and RPGs and stuff. I know they at least had one technical to their name, and one RPG or some other recoilless weapon, balancing the massive recoil of an oversized projectile by projecting a bigass explosion behind the shooter from the back of the weappn.\n\nWhich our intrepid heroes decided they wanted to basically snap-shoot from their technical. It'd probably have been a lot more understandable if it didn't come from people who do military stuff and shake out ideas for gear regularly, usually with my buddy close by to check for plausibility and make sure everyone's making up their own ideas.\n\nMy friend gets a reputation as a hardass but that's only because he loves worldbuilding and believes in logic and awesome playing together to build an appropriate tone, and likes it when people are creative on their own initiative, not dumbly imitating.\n\nSo, given a perfect reason to become a killer GM and hand the whole party their pink slips, he instead decided to throw the players a bone, grab a dice roller and leave the players to the hands of fate...\n\n...which promptly punished the four Not-Al-Qaeda for not checking over their shoulders or reading the instruction manuals. Three were cooked and one survived, probably left alive to serve as a warning.\n\nOf course, this was all brushed off as part of the game, and hell, mistakes happen. But what a lesson, right? Ask yourself, players: do you really want to do that thing that only sounds good in your head?\n\nDo you really, really want to?",

        "text": "* [&lt;&lt; previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/6vm0bu/vtm_jalees_kamal_villain_by_proxy_part_2/)\n\n[So, no shit, there we were](http://www.theallguardsmenparty.com/), standing in the security booth, staring at each other while Brain dropped the other shoe - not only were we stuck on the inside of the facility until someone from outside could do a complete power cycle, but the power surge had disabled the mechanism that normally alerted the security forces had been damaged during King’s tampering. Either the security team has already noticed and sent a response team ( or teams, based on where the building is and what’s nearby), or no one would notice until the morning shift attempted to gain access well after dawn.\n\nKing immediately rounded on Edvin, eager to have someone to foist the blame on. Edvin said nothing, merely waited for King to finish and then shake his head once.\n\n&gt;King: “This is all your fault, Ed. I did what you told me to do, and now because of your directions we’re all [screwed].”  \n&gt;Edvin: “King, it is your failure that has landed us in this mess. If you did not have confidence in your ability to handle the task, you should have said so.”  \n&gt;K: “[Shove] off! You were the one who told me to mess with the computers. I was just following orders.”  \n&gt;E: “Isn’t that what a bunch of the Nazis said? There is still blood on their hands.”  \n&gt;K: “What are you prattling about?”  \n&gt;Thea: “We need to be gone. What’s our next step?”  \n&gt;E: “I have something that may help us out of this predicament, but it will take time and focus. I suggest that you three look after Miser and try to find any further information you can, and perhaps an alternate method of escape, should I fail.”  \n&gt;K: “Oh, no, no more suggestions from you, old man. We need to get out of here, and right now!”  \n&gt;E: “As I said, I require time and focus. Either be quiet or leave.”  \n\nEdvin turned to the security array, pondering how complicated the wiring was. He had access to both the Path of the Levinbolt, which may work to give enough of a shock to the system to force a power cycle, and to Hands of Destruction, which could simply age the mechanisms enough that destroying them would be easy.\n\nKing was not in the mood to leave Edvin alone.\n\n&gt;K: “No, if we’re going somewhere, then we are all going. I’m not going to let you out of my sight for a moment. You Warlocks always find an out for yourself and leave everyone else to hang!” King grabs Edvin.  \n&gt;E: “I suggest you release me, before I make you release me.”  \n&gt;K: “I’d love to see you- oof.”  \n\nEdvin elected to use the least damaging tool in his arsenal to deal with this - Judo, his Brawl specialty. Edvin went for distance, not damage, so King was simply thrown out of the door and down the hallway, about 12 total yards.\n\n&gt;E: “Now either let me concentrate, or I’ll save us both the trouble and boil your blood.”  \n\nAfter the other player’s laughter had died down, Thea and Brain picked King up off of the floor and went to collect Miser. Edvin calmly shut the door, noting the mix of fear and surprise in King’s eyes, and returned to the security array. Brain was significantly better than him at these newfangled electronic security setups, but if he had enough time Edvin was confident that he could figure the right way of kicking the system until it did what he wanted it to do. He took a quick look around, and then began to charge himself for Path of the Levinbolt. He had to wait a few seconds for the charge to stabilize, and then he reached out and touched what looked like the main power conduit.\n\nIt was, in fact, the main *network* conduit. He only succeeded in frying every network card, computer, server, router, firewall and switch in the building. The smell of escaped magic smoke was now wafting through the building, acrid and rank. Edvin was displeased, but ultimately decided that he didn’t care. His next course of action was to find a spot which would allow him to decay the lock and force his way out of the building. He hadn’t been in the building before, but the security room had a map of the building on the wall, and he was able to pinpoint a location - a set of double doors with magnetic locks which fail closed. Edvin went to find the others, and opened the closet door to find quite the scene.\n\nThe other three were beside themselves attempting to look for Miser, while Miser was sitting still in the chair that he had been left in. Thea and King had begun to pick up and move the metal shelves around, while Brain was attempting to ponder the chair and failing.\n\n&gt;Thea: “Edvin, thank [bob]. We can’t find Miser.”  \n&gt;Edvin: “You… what?”   \n&gt;King: “Ha, speechless. We can’t find the damn mudblood.”  \n&gt;Edvin: “You mean Miser? The one we *tied to a [fluffy] chair*? The one still sitting in the [fluffy] chair we tied him to?”  \n&gt;Others: “What?”  \n&gt;Miser: (dropping Obfuscate) “You can see me?”  \n&gt;Edvin: “Clearly. Come on, I’ve found an exit.”  \n\nEdvin led them down a passage and around a corner to a tight hallway that ended in a magnetically locked double door. While Edvin kept his walking pace, the others rushed forward, trying to open the doors.\n\n&gt;King: “Well [silly], the door’s locked!”  \n&gt;Brain: “It’s magnetic, power’s out, it’s failed to a locked state.”  \n&gt;Miser: “This was your bright idea, Edvin?”  \n&gt;Edvin: “Gentlemen, please stand back a few minutes.”  \n\nEdvin reached out and focused, running his hand back and forth across the magnetic locking mechanism, and whispering an incantation. In reality, the whispering was unnecessary, but he had to keep up the misdirection. With a skillful usage of Hands of Destruction, the magnet rapidly failed, and the door sprang open. “A small amount of effort and thought can solve all problems.” He walked through, into the night air, then held the door open as the rest of the gang rushed through.\n\nThe group made its way back to the Prince’s Elysium, Edvin presented his report with some help from Thea’s phone, and gave Prince Santino a significant amount of problems to ponder. Edvin’s report went something like this: “HelloPrinceSantino,IHaveComeToReportOnTheIssueYouAssignedMyCoterieToLookInto.” At least for a bit, once they got behind closed doors and Edvin had the powerpoint showing over the project he calmed down again. \n\nEdvin’s report was short, gorey, and specific: While the medical examiners were attempting to decide if the sudden head trauma had caused his car crash, or if the head trauma had been a result of his car crash, Edvin was confident that the answer was neither. The car crash was completely staged, and someone with immense strength, or immense speed, or both, caused the sudden head trauma, which had not killed him, but put him at death’s door. The killing blow had been sudden, forced, loss of blood - either a vampire that covered their tracks well enough that there were no bite marks or other indications, or something of a magical nature. Edvin had meticulous notes, clearly articulated facts and deductions, and an array of documents, pictures and videos to support his conclusion.\n\nHe was, of course, lying through his teeth. The mayor, a man of both advanced age and advanced weight, had died from a heart attack, knocked his head on the window, which caused an initial contusion, then crashed his car, mangling his limp body (which accounted for the loss of blood) and causing another, larger contusion on his head. All of this lead to a case where the M.E. looked for obvious trauma, found it, and didn’t look any further. And that lead to a point of leverage that Edvin could use to disrupt the local court.\n\n* [next &gt;&gt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/6woxiv/vtm_jalees_kamal_villain_by_proxy_part_4/)",

        "text": "I'm a gamer with eclectic tastes, which means I play a lot of weird games, or at least games with unusual histories that I'll remember somewhere down the line. I played Uniracers, for example, played it religiously without actually getting any good at it and didn't know of its history or the destiny of its developers and how they'd eventually make a bajillion dollars off of Grand Theft Auto.\n\nLikewise, I didn't have the slightest idea I'd be stepping into it big time with the mobile version of Godus, a god game by (in)famous gaming figure Peter Molyneux, but let's rewind to several years ago when this was first released. Touted as the ultimate god game, and honestly one of my first...what could you call it, civilization-building, kinda-sorta Farmville-ish...world-build-y things. I got it for my iPad because I figured it was a good sort of introduction to this kind of game, and that its graphics and mechanics sounded like fun on a big touch screen, what with rubbing the land to stretch and squash it layer by colorful layer to make the perfect land for my people.\n\nI also figured, hey, I'm Catholic, I know exactly what kind of god I'm supposed to be, which is God with a big G. Fellas in tunics, very Mesopotamian houses, cities, wandering in the desert, chosen people going forth and multiplying, yadda yadda yadda. I go to Church, I thought, I've got this. I can look after my dudes, basically build a people farm in a fancy-schmancy Eden on highly-stylized Earth.\n\nFor a while, I did great, or I sure as hell thought I was doing great. I was avoiding all the usual free-to-play traps, which of course this stupid game had in spades, but hey, I followed the rules, gathered Faith from my followers to power my miracles, learned more and more as I went to feed everybody, put them up on high, green spots and not all that much higher because more height apparently means more faith and not more oxygen deprivation, and went hunting around for the game's proto-gacha system to go grabbing societal evolution gubbins to advance my game. I liked building my buildings, amassing followers and then marveling at my world. I mean, hey! I'm God in this game, right? That's what I do, marvel at my mighty works and get my followers to marvel at my mighty works, get other dudes from other places to marvel at my mighty works and worship me. That's how this God dealio works.\n\nI was missing that last bit until the Astari showed up. They're your first...challenge, let's say, in the game. They're another civilization with their own gaudy-looking...mask-wearing Buddha-looking fella in a big...oyster...thing...idol. Yeah, they're a mess - they look like someone took a bunch of different non-Abrahamic religions' deities and smashed them together like Play-Doh of different colors, but like that Play-Doh ball, instead of getting Joseph's Amazing Technicolor Dream-Doh, they ended up with a stupid-looking homogenous poo ball with vestigial colors not yet squished out by the haphazardness of the hands working it to death. They're what makes you shift from just trying to keep your people happy to trying to keep them happier than a doofy party city that somehow doesn't have the ridiculous maintenance costs that my civilization has, with me using my godly powers to continually beautify my constantly faltering lands until by all rights my people should probably be blind from the sunshine, but I guess thats the price of expansion. Keeping everybody happier than the Astari was a chore. Whenever I wasn't at the screen my people suddenly somehow got grumpy, and they kept going to the Astari city thing, no matter how many Astari I'd ended up converting to my side to basically do nothing, so that foreshadows how much the game cares about the Astari, and I thought I'd cared more than that. The game really wanted you to pull some stupid stunts on the Astari, but beautifying the land to make these masked, hula skirt-wearing yahoos which the game seems to regard as little more than warm bodies was cheap, free if I was patient, and really reliable. Keep making everything in the Promised Land obnoxiously bright and fill the air with flower petals until all my faithful flock started dying from seasonal allergies or falling down a cliff when a wayward petal sticks them in the eye, and Astari would be packing their bags to crash in my homegrown believers' pads. Boy, this game didn't think too kindly of converts...\n\n...it also wouldn't abide by my careful approach. As time went on, I was more and more tempted to switch gears to the miracles that weren't very miraculous for their recipients: swamps and meteors. Eventually, because I guess this is what happens when you try to get a human with finite time and patience to play a being that conceptually is beyond those two limitations, I decided to bend and answered my inner Old Testament. After all, the only stipulation was that my people needed to be happier than the Astari, and from a certain point of view, \"less miserable\" is still technically \"happier.\"\n\nThe first thing I swung for was meteors, because if I was also supposed to be a fire and brimstone kinda God, much as I hate the idea myself, I'd do it once and be done with it. Besides, I figured that whacking their idol thingamabob would teach them a thing or two for badmouthing an omnipotent being and all his followers. Like, seriously, that's what they're introduced doing. Oh well, I'm overthinking this, I thought, as I reached for enough faith to drop a dinosaur-killer on the unholy genetic splicing of Venus, Buddha, Bacchus, Aku Aku and someone's kitsch hula-dancing dashboard ornament. So I drop one, and it slams into the city, dudes are on fire because a lot of Astari were outside that day, their happiness fell and that was that. As big and awesome as that was, it was a temporary thing, and so I reached for something else that I figured was a lot less deadly and far more annoying: swamps.\n\nSwamps are kind of like anti-beautifying-or-whatever-it's-called, and they're permanent to boot rather than temporary, barring removal from beautification or whatever this blessing thing I did is. They also make people grumpy rather than happy, so I figured if I laid some down I'd just sit there, watching as the Astari got grumpier and grumpier and more disapproving of their now-gross lands and would then pack up their things and move to where things were less scuzzy. I laid down a lot of these stupid things and watched as the Astari, fickle things they were, decided that maybe if their...Polynesian-Greco-Roman Buddha wasn't renovating the place, they'd go to a deity with a functioning public works program.\n\nWhich was where everything unraveled due to a lack of pathfinding and me forgetting that swamps are lethal to those who blunder into them. See, the Astari left their city in droves, only for me to be just too late to watching them all blunder into the same swamp and die there.\n\nAll of them. Hundreds of souls, sinking to their deaths like a horde of Lemmings in the hands of an inattentive player.\n\nThis was at a point where Godus was just a dude farm, a village-building simulator that just so happened to give you God's powers, and that was all that I'd signed on for it to be. I'd won, sure, but it was a very empty victory, standing atop a mountain I'd only proclaimed lonely because I'd kicked off the only other guy on the summit, and there, see? There was his body, still sprawled on the next crag down. The game had basically lost all meaning to me because I'd betrayed my principles just to get one over on a people who almost seem in hindsight like they were made just to be dealt with in such a way. Which is natural if you're looking for a model of Calvinism, I suppose, but not if you're trying to be good guy God, which I most certainly was trying to be, up until I failed with all the efficiency of a...thing...that fails...real badly...and deliberately.\n\nThe point is, there was nothing else. New civilizations weren't there to play around with for trade or advancement, the only one that wasn't mine was deliberately antagonistic, and the only thing I'd have to look forward to according to the progress tracker was just make bigger buildings for more dudes to sit in. I'd realized how...pointless...the game kind of felt. This wasn't Sim City, after all, and most importantly, the whole genocide thing put a really bad taste in my mouth. I decided to look online and see if anybody had decided to do any better than I did, and I don't know what I was expecting, but I didn't get anything except everyone who'd either wiped out the Astari or followed the same grinding path to villainy I'd followed.\n\nWIth no way to load a previous save outside a complete reinstall, and I had no patience for that because this is a mobile game that sucks your money if it doesn't suck your time, I decided I was entirely done. As if it was an apology to the now-extinct Astari, I got rid of all the swamps I'd made, and quietly left the game. At some point I believe I uninstalled the game.\n\nI did at least get a bit of lore I'm unsure what to do with, but doesn't that sound interesting? A god, or some religion, where a creator god had such hope for their people, created a cradle for them to grow, prepared them to grow great and stretch across the world...until a final transgression from that god caused them to leave in terrible grief. Now those people look up at an empty sky and pray not for the god's favor - they know their god existed and had their back. But now they have to go looking for their god, and it's doubtful they're in any hurry to come back from their side, so concerned that their next touch could wipe out another civilization.\n\n...what could bring that god back? Who knows. Could make a campaign out of it, probably.",

Read it here; https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/6sdlbu/homebrew_pnp_rpg_little_rascals_chapter_one_how/\n\nYou know… most villains I’ve heard of were pretty shitty dudes.\nLike really bad guys. Dudes that made their names because they we’re some kind of evil genius, misguided, broken souls… someone who had motivations and abitions that led him onto an evil path I guess.\nNot so my group of little rascals. No.\nThey just fuck shit up. I strongly belive thet they thrive in utter fucking chaos. They need it to breathe. And I am loving it.\n\nIn this session Roina is missing. Her player wasn't able to join us, but next time, she'll be back again!\n\nIf you wanna find out how they became pirates, stole some really expensive painting, killed a man with nothing but an exploding barrel and became known as the vile poisoners of Port Ica – all of this by accident! – then I’ve got a treat for you.\n\nOur story starts at dawn. The Lahndgank is at Port Ica once again; Logan, Quincy, Atticus and his mechanical spider Izi and of course Kiras row towards the docks. It’s a nice day, seagulls are shrieking, dockworkers are drunk at like eight o’ clock and the air smells like horseshit.\nIt smells like a fucking adventure.\nThey walk towards the city and talk to an old guy to ask him what happened yesterday. They tell him, that they heard rumours and don’t know anything, because they spent the night at sea. He tells them (well I did with my best old-man-Jenkins impression), that there was a slaughter yesterday. About twenty people run wide eyed into town, begun to rape and plunder, killed some people and at dawn themselves. Shit. Now they know what happens if the ship leaves while someone that was aboard when the infernal glyph was inscribed is still on an island.\nThey ask if he knows why that happened.\nHe shrugs and says, that he had no clue, but he thinks it was poison.\nNow for clarity; they left port Ica at 23:30 (11:30pm) to search for the sea witch. But they know, that they’ll be busted when the people start to assuming, that they could be connected to the massacre. So they start lying. And they do it badly.\nThey talk for a while and at some point the old man is irritated, because they told him that they left at dusk, but then Kiras tells him, that they sailed in the smooth starlight, at which point it becomes clear, that they botched it, so they give the old man a coin and go searching for the nautical archives.\nIt won’t be until later when they realise their mistake.\n\nThe nautical archive is a great library for sea maps, built into a giant blue nautilus shell, right in the middle in the city. Of course it’s not just a shell; there are walls, gates and fences, shelfs, lights and more. So they walk up front and ask a guard if they could get into the archive.\nHe tells them, that they need some papers that qualify them for entrance. They need the blue pass of port Ica.\nThey ask him, if the silver pass of the royal bank is also sufficient.\nHe grins and lets them in. \n“Only half an hour, lads! After shift turn you won’t be able to get out again, so hurry!” he tells them.\nAlright, no pressure.\nThey walk into the shell and  it turns out, that all the interior walls of the snail shell were cut out. There are enormous supporting pillars, gigantic shelfs opulently filled with a myriad of scrolls, tomes, map cases, racks jam-packed with parchment and crates bursting with quills, ink jars and all kinds of map makers tools.\nOkay. Fuck. Pressure. A fuckton of it.\nEverybody starts running around, manically trying to find a map that leads to the isle of the monkey king. Half an hour is not enough to look at every single map in this shitty room, heck half a year wouldn’t be long enough! While everyone else is panicking, Quincy walks around and let’s his fingertips wander around, feeling the leather of the scroll holders, looking for something… special. He is blind, indeed, but he has the sixth sense… a rare and mystic ability that allows him to navigate even though he can’t see (remember these traits that are purchasable at character generation?).\nSuddenly he feels something. Something special about this particular piece of… canvas?\nHe pulls it out of the shelf and calls for someone with functioning eyes. They all come together and look at the map. Indeed; it leads from Port Ica to the isle of the monkey king. On the back side is a portrait of a pirate that stands upon the carcass of an monstrous ape. Weird, but ok.\nThey try to take the map with ‘em, but one of the scribes warns them that it’s not allowed to take a map. But they can copy it for just one silver coin (about 10 bucks). Alright, that’s not too expensive. \nSo they have Kiras copying it.\nSo I tell him “Alright. You can give yourself any difficulty you want, but the higher you go, the easier will the navigation check be to sail to the island”.\n“Okay.” he says. “I want to make the worst copy possible.”\n“Nice, so roll… wait. What?”\n“I wanna make a really shitty copy. Like a child’s drawing or something like this.”\n“Okay, WHY?” I ask, completely confused.\n“You’ll see.”\n\nOkay, so he makes this unbelievable bad copy and then asks Logan and Quincy to ask a lot about the map. While they keep the scribe distracted, Kiras puts the bad copy into the scroll holder and shoves the original into his own holder.\nThe scribe tells them, that on this portrait is a man named “Captain Robert the Red” to be seen. Legend has it, that he conquered the isle and killed it’s inhabitans, the devil monkeys. \n\nOkay, nice, that’s cool, bye.\n\nThey walk out of the archive and try to look as if they belong there. They didn’t even cross the market place when they hear a scream;\n“Hold the thieves!“\nOkay, maybe this wasn’t the best idea. But nothing a good ol’ relentless pursuit couldn’t fix! Kiras sprints onward, racing across the field to reach the Lahndgank.\nAlright! Next one, Logan, roll for athletics!\n“No, I pretend to be a normal customer at the market.”\nOookay… Quincy? Same. Atticus? Also pretending.\nWell…\nSix Guards approach them, telling them to surrender. They tell them, that they have never been in the archive. The scribe steps forward, Kiras copy in one hand. He tells the guards, that these men are the ones. They try tenaciously to deny, but the scribe has the higher authority and they are arrested.\nNot too bad (I said to myself). I’ll take them to the guards post, empty their pockets and let them off the hook. What could go wrong?\nOh. Ohhh, naïve little me. A lot is the answer. A lot can go wrong.\nSo the guard leads them through the thigh alleys of Port Ica. As they come into an alleyway with some barrels, their batshit-crazy plan comes into action. Logan grabs an empty barrel and throws it behind him. At the same time Quincy whirls around and casts a push-spell.\nThey roll for a team-action and have a critical failure.\nWhat they tried was to knock the guards off their feet. What they managed to do was to bust the barrel mid-air and sprinkle the guards behind them with wooden shrapnels.\nWell. They tried to solve this without bloodshed. They fucked up. A lot.\nTwo guards go down, one of them screaming “My eyes! Oh gods, my eyes!” Two guards are behind  Quincy, one guard is in front of Logan. \nThe sound of swords getting drawn from their scabbards fills the ally.\n\nRoll for initiative.\n\nAtticus steps aside to indicate that he won’t get involved in this unnecessary violence. The guard nods and runs past him. He swings his sword against Logan who tries to dodge it, but with a fleshy ‘slurp noise the guard thrusts his sword into Logans arm. First he thinks that he has landed a great hit, then he realises that something, or rather someone, has grabbed the sword. With dread he looks up to see Logans eyes, his gaze has become a mad stare filled with bloody rage.\n(Remember the Traits you can purchase at character creation? This is ‘Frenzy’)\nLogan grabs the sword, rams the guard in the wall behind him and thrusts the sword (which is still driven into his arm) into the neck of the guardsman. \nAt the same time Quincy dodges a swing from one of his opponents, but gets a bad wound from the other. He then uses a move from his combat manoeuvres to punch the living shit out of the one guy. Logan runs up to him, slamming the sword madly in the general direction. The guard dodges, realising too late, that Quincy’s movepool for this round isn’t empty yet.\nA faint punching sound is to be heard from the ally, then it’s empty. \n\nThen a scream. The scribe runs for his life. Alarming the rest of the guardsmen.\nShit. Too noticeable to try to catch him. So they run for it.\nAs they arrive at the docks, they see that the Lahndgank is ready for take-off. But… Kiras didn’t remember to send someone to get the others.\nA cog is a boat for made for trading. I’ll try to explain the problem, but I fear, that my knowledge of the english language will fail me here; it lies pretty deep in the water. So it can’t come too close to the shore. Which means you need a dinghy to reach the coast. Aaand of course you need a dinghy to reach it. \nBut there they were; standing at the docks, a dozen guards behind them and their dinghy tied to their ship. Kiras didn’t remember to row back to the docks after he told the crew to make the Lahndgank ready.\n“Remind me to fucking barbeque that shard-damned cow…” curses Logan.\nThey run towards an old man with a little cockleshell, throw him a gold piece into his lap and jump into his boat, rowing like hell to reach the Lahndgank.\nBefore the guard could reach their own ships, they reach the open sea.\nDamn luckers.\n\nThis almost concludes the second session.\nAfter this, they tried to buy something at an island where they found out, that there was now a bounty for the crew of the pirate-ship “Lahndgank”.\nTurns out, that the old man at the docks told the guard what they told him and they thought, that they had poisoned their grog, which led to the people losing their minds and rampaging.\nSo now they’re known as the “vile poisoners of Port Ica”.\n\nIf you’ve enjoyed this little story, I am sure, that you’ll love what happened next. If you want to know how a sailor, two barmen, a traveling monster hunter, an engineer and a group of adventurers made their first step to become the greatest warmongers the blue sea has ever seen, found a cursed pirate treasure, established good relationships with a bunch of apes and talked to the rarest elementals the world knows of… then you’ll need to read Chapter 3 – The island of the monkey king!\nTill next time!\n",

        "text": "On a whim, I decided to run a short Pathfinder campaign over the summer set in the universe of the Witcher series. For those unfamiliar, it's like your standard Tolkien-esque setting except everything is shit. Humans are racist, elves and dwarves are oppressed, and everybody is frequently murderized by horrible monsters.\n\nI wanted it to be very character-driven, so we started at a reasonably high level, as low-level PCs would probably die often and horrifically in such a world. My players came up with:\n\nThorin, half-elf magus. Former Witcher of the griffin school who was exiled, but still lends his services as a professional monster hunter. Wields an intelligent sword possessed by a wraith. Has a chip on his shoulder.\n\nHagenbor, dwarf alchemist. Took a mutagen that gives him angelic wings, and attaches his bombs to arrows. Avid Gwent player.\n\nAe'Zeus, a blind life oracle/paladin. He's half elf and, well, he never knew his father. Provides ALL THE HEALS. Rides a white mule named Jaru'Solem. \n\nNone of us are religious, but I saw this as a great storytelling opportunity.\n\nOur story began in the south of the nothern kingdom of Kovir, basically fantasy Switzerland. Thorin, travelling alone, met Ae'Zeus on the road one night. \"Come and sit by my fire, friend,\" Ae'Zeus said, \"You look hungry. Here, have some of my food. I thought I only had enough for one, but... oh, look at this! I have enough for two.\"\n\nThey began travelling together, and stumbled upon Hagenbor, who was fending off a pack of nekkers (flabby-chinned goblins). The other two slew them while Ae'zeus turned the other cheek, although he did smite one that bit him on the hand.\n\nThe group journeyed to a small farming town, where Thorin takes a contract to slay a wyvern that has killed some of the townsfolk. Hagenbor just decided to take flight and soar over the nearby mountains until he spotted the beast's nest and destroyed its eggs with a large bomb, sending the giant reptile into a fury. Hagenborn led it back to town, where Thorin faced it down and Ae'Zeus provided so much healing no one ended up being in any real danger. I realized I would need better monsters.\n\nThe party collected their reward and hit the road, killing some drowners along the way, until they reached the mining town of Passwell. Ae'Zeus volunteered his time at the local temple, where he learned that none of the miners returned home from work a while ago, and none had dared to find out what had happened.\n\nSo they went. At the entrance of the mine, they met the guest character Ouee, a gnome dervish dancer, basically a living beyblade. \n\nThey descended into the darkness.\n\nInside, they found the torn-apart corpses of some of the miners. Corpses, of course, attract ghouls, which Thorin easily dispatched with lots of flame blasts. Further in, the group was ambushed by an ekimmara, a savage lesser vampire, on a staircase down a deep pit. Ouee began breakdancing around in an ankle-slicing whirl of blades. Ae'Zeus charged in, and put everything he had into a Lay on Hands on the vampire.\n\nUnfortunately, vampires in the Witcher universe are not undead. The beast was back to full health.\n\nThorin tried to swing across the pit to strike the creature in a swashbuckling fashion, crit failed, and fell 30 feet down, breaking several bones. Only several minutes afterward did Ouee remember that she had feather fall in her spell list.\n\nAfter a lot more trying, they felled the beast, and Ae'Zeus mended Thorin's bones. They strode further in, Thorin leading the way with his sword alight. They found that the mineshaft had broken into some kind of ruin. Within was the lair of three vampires. A finely-dressed higher vampire with a goatee lounged at a long table drinking blood from a wine glass, which he refilled from an iron maiden with a tap on the bottom. \n\nHe introduced himself as Count Nosferat. His two comrades were a hulking bestial vampire known as Brutus and a twisted mongrel called Skur. Ae'Zeus diplomatically reached a bargain of the lives of the remaining miners chained to the wall in exchange for the townsfolk leaving the vampires alone to hibernate.\n\nThe party returned to town with the few workers still alive and told them to shut down that mine. Ouee melted into the shadows and disappeared (Time conflicts with her player).\n\nThey hit the road once more, which led to the winter capital of Lan Exeter. The first stop was a dwarven blacksmith, from whom Thorin bought a new suit of armor and Ae'Zeus had a golden cup smelted from ore that Hagenbor had pocketed in the mine. \n\nThey took a contract from the City Watch and ventured to the riverlands in the north, killing some foglets and a hag that had been preying on merchants and travelers. Shortly after they returned for the bounty, they discovered that the town of Passwell had been completely wiped off the map.\n\nThe three joined a company of Watch men to go investigate. When they arrived, they found the city in ruin, the entire population slaughtered. Nosferat stepped over a pile of corpses and explained that the townsfolk hadn't stayed out of the mine, then sicced Brutus on them.\n\nThe monstrous batlike monster tore through the ranks of the Watch, until Thorin squared off with him. With a roar, Brutus charged at him and made his two attacks.\n\nBoth (already powerful) claw strikes were natural 20s.\n\nThorin was dealt so much damage he was knocked deep in the negatives, instakilled as Nosferat's lackey literally ripped him in half. For once, Ae'Zeus's healing could not save him.\n\nMeanwhile, a distraught Hagenbor flew straight at the Count, who in turn grew bat wings and engaged him in aerial combat. The dice fared much better in the dwarf's favor, who managed to shred one of Nosferat's wings with a well-placed exploding arrow, sending him plummeting off a cliff.\n\nWe didn't have any extra character sheets on hand, so I ruled that Thorin was critted so hard he was unable to pass into the afterlife. As his soul was bonded to his wraith-sword, he, too, became a wraith, and manifested a ghostly body to hold the sword. He also got a lot more in touch with the spirit he shares his bound vessel with. Her name was Elizabeth. She's a nice lady.\n\nA confused Brutus broke off the fight and went to drag his master somewhere he could regenerate. The survivors of the battle limped back to the capital, worried for the future. Ae'Zeus was approached by one of the soldiers. He was enraptured with everything the messiah had to say, and pledged his life to the cause. His name was Lukas.\n\nWith their first follower writing down everything Ae'Zeus said, the party rushed to the summer capital of Pont Vanis to both warn them and seek the aid of the Guild of Pyromancers that resided there. Along the way, they met Aglar, a druid of the winter forest, and his bear companion, Artemis. Both man and bear were quite fond of a sharp-smelling pipe weed.\n\nAs they approached the front gates, they noticed they were locked tight. A plague had stricken the city, and none were allowed in or out until the quarantine could be lifted. Ae'Zeus managed to talk his way in (he had 20 charisma) and immediately began healing the sick, joined by a local herbalist, Markov. Thorin skulked around in the shadows until he discovered the lair of a garkain, a plague vampire. He alerted the others, and they laid a trap for it, which didn't work quite as intended but they slayed it, regardless. As it turned out, the creature was the same malformed being Nosferat referred to as Skur.\n\nThe cure for the plague was made from the beast's powdered fangs and distributed through the city's water supply as Ae'Zeus proclaimed, \"I give unto thee the waters of life.\"\n\nJust as the city was about to be reopened, a shadow loomed over the horizon. Shambling toward Pont Vanis was an army of thousands of ghouls, with Count Nosferat at its head. Aglar heroically threw himself from the city wall, casting a raging blizzard around himself as he feather-fell toward the advancing horde. Ae'Zeus rolled a nat 20 acrobatics check to leap after him, landing on the hermit's back and surfing him to the ground. Thorin and Hagenbor could fly, so they, of course, had nothing to worry about.\n\nThe bear took the stairs.\n\nAs everyone else rushed to meet the army head on, Hagenbor rallied the Watch's archers, gave an inspiring speech in and out of character, and rolled a 20. Ae'Zeus had transformed into a being of holy fire, who doubled in size when hit with Hagenbor's critical bomb.\n\nAs the blizzard swelled, the swarm of necrophages collided with the champions of the faith, and thus began the Battle of Ice and Fire.\n\nThe fire-being Ae'Zeus tore through the front ranks, and while his faithful held the bulk off, he faced the Count, who, after a few minutes, broke off from the chaos and flew over the walls. Ae'Zeus pursued him, finding him in the city's library, lovingly referred to by the group as the Bookery.\n\nThe vampire lord had already found what he had been looking for, a detailed record of monster sightings. Through his otherworldly diplomacy, Ae'Zeus was able to learn that his ultimate goal was to find his beloved, a vampiress who had been buried alive 200 years ago by some angry peasants.\n\nDespite Nosferat's past transgressions, Ae'Zeus turned the other cheek, and agreed to help him in his endeavor. The vampire willed his undead army to retreat, and many lives were spared.\n\nWith this tentative truce, they journeyed north. During a series of chance encounters, including one where Ae'Zeus walked on water to save some fisherman, they met the blacksmith from Lan Exeter in a tavern. They decided to help him find a magic suit of armor he was looking for, since it was on the way. It lay in an ancient elven ruin, inside which they found Hagenbor's three estranged brothers, also searching for the armor.\n\nHagenbor killed his older brother (there was much older bad blood) and intimidated the others into visiting their mother once in a while. Further into the ruin, they found what they were looking for. The armor turned out to be an armored automaton, which Thorin possessed as his new body.\n\nAt last, they reached a small village in the northern mountains. Nosferat's beloved was buried in a sacred grove that lay within the domain of a Leshen, an old and powerful woodland spirit. Aglar, being of the forest, did a little ritual that allowed them to pass unmolested.\n\nOnce in the grove, Brutus and some ghouls dug up the stone coffin, but cut his hand on a chain that bound it. At the smell of blood, the coffin burst open, revealing that the once-beautiful vampiress had become a Vargeist, a monstrous thing of hate, loathing, and bloodthirst.\n\nIt was a hard fight, but they put her out of her misery. After respectfully cremating the body and beginning the journey back to the city, they discovered that the region had been invaded by the Nilfgaardian Empire.\n\nThe party formed the core of the resistance movement, waging a guerrilla war to disrupt the Empire. Though they were vastly outnumbered, Ae'Zeus's presence meant that their troops were nigh-invincible. He had acquired quite a following by this point, including his 12 Devoted:\n\nThorin\n\nHagenbor\n\nAglar\n\nArtemis\n\nLukas the veteran\n\nMarkov the herbalist\n\nStreuben the blacksmith\n\nThe Pyromancers Simone and Mathias\n\nThe fishers Petra and Thames\n\nJood the troll\n\nSadly, Ae'Zeus was betrayed by the last, and Jood, through his stupidity, let a company of Nilfgaardian soldiers through the walls. The general of the army offered an ultimatum: peace in the realm, and Nilfgaard would give the smallfolk food supplies during the hard winter that had just started, but Ae'Zeus, Nosferat, and Brutus must die.\n\nBeing the self-sacrificing type, the half-elf accepted, and he and his followers had one last supper, which I illustrated here: http://i.imgur.com/cXpM6nm.jpg He said his final farewells to them, and had a touching moment with Nosferat discussing the afterlife.\n\nThe three met the soldiers outside the walls of Lan Exeter, where they were put in chains and marched to the edge of the forest while debris was thrown at them by Nilfgaardian infantryman. The group could only watch in horror as their savior was hoisted up and crucified to the branches of a tree. The two vampires were given the same treatment. Wood and oil were stacked at the bases, and the general gave his sentence. Ae'Zeus murmured, \"Forgive them, Father, they know not what they do.\"\n\nThe trees were set ablaze, and the fires burned long and bright.\n\nAs the smoke cleared, it was evident that the two vampires had been burned to a crisp.\n\nAe'Zeus was still alive.\n\nHowever, he was no Targaryen, only partially immune, and his blackened, charred, but still breathing body was traumatizing to look at. The shocked general quickly stepped forward and gutted him with his hunting knife, finally ending it. Then, without a word, the army dispersed, leaving the messiah for the birds.\n\nHagenbor took his body down and flew it to the ruin where they found Thorin's armor, sealing it with a large stone. As they solemnly mourned him, Thorin gave a heartfelt speech about how rolling over for the Empire is a disgrace to His memory, and they needed to have one last stand. He rallied the faithful, and with the aid of some viking mercenaries, took on the bulk of the Nilfgaardian forces at the Battle of the Black Tree.\n\nIt was an awful, bloody battle. So many died that the veil between life and death rippled, and out of the aether crawled a being most Witchers never even saw in their lifetimes: an Arch Wraith, which manifested in the bones of Nosferat that the group had neglected to bury.\n\nThe kingdom became shrouded in darkness, absorbed into the Arch Wraith's realm. Within, it was all-powerful, and immune to all that were not a part of its story. Thorin led the survivors of the battle on a trek to its fortress, but knew the odds were against them. Morale was low.\n\nUntil Ae'Zeus came back.\n\nA shining beacon of light, he descended from the heavens, to the bewilderment of all present. He said very little, but the look on his face told them he was truly enlightened. Floating above the heads of the soldiers, he gave them the strength to carry on, until at last, the black gates of the dread fortress loomed before them.\n\nThe Arch Wraith conjured an army of skeletal minions to fight them, but the forces of good held strong until Hagenbor blew a hole in the gate, which Thorin reached through and removed the door bar.\n\nWith one last push, they stormed the keep, and engaged the Arch Wraith in a final showdown. It was not without cost, and even Thorin was knocked to one knee, but when all seemed lost, Ae'Zeus channeled so much he ended up dealing 36d6 damage to the wraith, which his player actually counted, picked up, and rolled. Regardless, it was more than enough to kill it.\n\nWith an explosion of holy light, the realm was returned to normal. Thorin and Elizabeth, now free of their earthly tether, floated into the sky, where they saw Ae'Zeus waiting for them with arms wide open.\n\nHagenbor looked around and realized that he was the only PC left. He got together with the remaining Devoted, and with Streuben's metalworking skills, helped invent the printing press.\n\nThe first book they printed was a collection of all that the Devoted had written of Ae'Zeus's teachings. Emblazoned on the cover was a man on a burning tree.\n\nThe book circulated quickly throughout the land, becoming the dominant religion, leading to political and cultural reforms that benefited all.\n\nAnd for once, at least for a little while, everything wasn't shit.\n\nTL;DR: Elf Jesus saves the world.",

        "text": "*[&lt;&lt; previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/6ve966/vtm_jalees_kamal_villain_by_proxy_part_1/)\n\nBetween sessions I talked with Lady ST for about two hours to try and narrow down exactly what she wanted me to do. There was a lot of vagueness when we began, and we ended with some fairly well defined requirements and goals for me. I’ll talk about the goals some other time.\n\nThe requirements were pretty simple - I played a standard Lick with a bit of bonus XP for being late to join, and I could have a single contact in the Sabbat as a “support” character. A character that would do their best to help me, but could only work through contacts, resources and various in-game methods. Naturally, I picked Jalees as my support character. She almost turned me down, too, which would have been unfortunate, and meant me walking away from the deal. We had a discussion on what all the support character could do and restrictions and yadda yadda, then we talked about the Tremere I wanted to play.\n\nOh, and I couldn’t start with Lure of Flames or Movement of the Mind. Apparently whoever played a Tremere in her last game did some high-lactose things with those, and so she didn’t like to give them out. Didn’t bother me at all. I wasn’t going to need them anyways.\n\nEdvin, a pre-Camarilla Tremere, was well over 600 years of age, and had been through more wars than most Licks had drank pints of blood. Edvin was terribly annoyed with the imminent Camarilla/Sabbat divide, and had left the Tremere proper almost a century before the First Anarch Revolt happened, spending his time alternately travelling the world and sleeping for a few decades. He was in torpor when the Convention of Thorns, the treaty that created the Camarilla/Anarch state and the precipitating event for the formation of the Sabbat, and did not find out until much later than many of his friends had gone to the Sabbat side, and that House Tremere was incredibly guarded against them, and their rituals.\n\nI tell you this history to tell you the advantages that Edvin had. Edvin was not affected by the Tremere curse which would reveal him as a traitor should he participate in Sabbat rites, and he was not beholden to the Tremere council by a blood bond. These, as well as his deep connections to the Sabbat, were his dark secret. \n\nAdditionally. Edvin had the social wombo combo: Enchanting Voice plus Soothing Voice, topped with Sanctity - a total of +3 dice to all social tests, and -3 difficulty to the same. Other highlights include his Thaumaturgy paths array: Blood 3, Countermagic 3, Levinbolt 2 and Focused Mind 2. I decided I would get Hands of Destruction later.\n\nWith that out of the way, we can get to the second game:\n\nI arrived to the second game with a (small) note pad, maybe 3 in. by 3 in. or so. I chose these, in a green-blue color, to use to pass notes. Normally, I intensely dislike anyone passing notes, because it is more effective - emotionally - for a player to know that something is coming, and their character to be blindsided. In this instance, because I had resources, goals and such that the players couldn’t catch wind of, I decided to bend my rule. I would, for the most part, stick to yes/no questions and try not to involve dice.\n\nI even found chances to pass notes to other players, to keep them roped in.\n\nI wanted to play Edvin as, by nature, curious. Even though he was well over 600 it should be natural for him to question things, in a measured and scientific manner. He could display bouts of obsession and laser focus, but for the most part he was measured and methodical. This often put him at odds with both King and, to a lesser extent, the other more beataturgy-oriented members of the local Camarilla.\n\nTo help illustrate this is our first real bit of action, investigating the death of one of the local mayors. The newspapers had been running several different stories on the why and how, and the medical community could not seem to pinpoint the cause of death. Prince Santino asked for a few of the medically trained members to look into the details and see if there wasn’t some hint we could give to point the poor cattle in the right direction, and the political process of electing a replacement was being hampered by the divisiveness of the articles.\n\nI used one of my pre-written notes here, as it was appropriate: “Did my nightly report have anything about this?” It turned out that Edvin had seen some information during one of his nightly reports from Jalees. Jalees had made a note that the medical community was in fact conflicted over the cause of death, but that the media uproar was being fanned by a third party, probably someone interested in securing the mayor’s seat with some ally of theirs.\n\nEdvin, though somewhat out of date on most topics, always made sure to study medicine first, and other advances later, although medicine was quickly being replaced with machines and computers on his priority list. Man advanced so quickly now, it was hard to sleep for hundreds of years at a time anymore. He volunteered to have a look at the data, and even to go out to the morgue and arrange to view the corpse and perform new tests, if the Prince liked.\n\nAnd so the PCs and I journeyed out into the deep night, growing ever longer now that midsummer had passed, and to the second least comfortable place for most people: the county morgue. For vampires, though, it should have been no big deal - after all, we weren’t more than half a step out of the grave anyways. Miser (Trev’s character) we would come to find out, has an issue with corpses - he has Major Phobia(Death).\n\nAfter his initial whining and a scare when he rolled for Fear Frenzy, we were able to strap Miser to a chair and forget about him in a nearby closet for a little while. Edvin convinced Brain, who was also scientific in nature though he leaned towards technology, to help him examine the body and Thea to record their findings. King was given the job of finding the security desk and looping or deleting the recordings of the security cameras that night. Normally, I would have switched Brain and King, but I wanted to get a feel for what happens when the group willfully sent one member to do something that another member was demonstrably better at. \n\nTo my surprise, everything went fine. King was able to shut the cameras off by faking a power surge, and delete what they had recorded that night so far. Between Brain and I we were able to find the true cause of death, which was quite different from the ‘official’ cause of death, and we left it to Thea to secure the intelligence until we needed to present it to the Prince. Problems only began to happen when we turned to leave.\n\nYou see, King hadn’t faked a power surge - he had caused a power surge. He was successful in disabling the security cameras, but he had also tripped power alarms and sent the outer section of the facility on lockdown until the system decided that the power had been properly restored. Brain led us to the security system, took a quick look at it, and relayed that the system wouldn’t reset until the whole building had gone through a complete power cycle - “It’s got to be all the way down, and then all the way back up.” - which was out of the question as he didn’t know the proper sequence.\n\nSo we were trapped, with two likely resolutions: \nThe security company noticed the issue and sent someone to investigate. This would mean people, which would mean explanations, lies and worming our way out, or murdering mortals and possibly breaking the Masquerade.\nPeople began to arrive for work in the morning. Morning means sleepy vampires, and our favorite thing in the world.\n\nSunlight.\n\n* [ next &gt;&gt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/6vum9a/vtm_jalees_kamal_villain_by_proxy_part_3/)",

        "text": "Hello, r/gametales, and [welcome back](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2gswud/vampiretmthe_short_story_of_john_random_and_the/?ref=search_posts) to [Story Time](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2h8xzq/vampiretm_john_randoms_revenge_glossary/?ref=search_posts) with [Jalees](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3bo141/vtmmedthe_new_adventures_of_jalees_kamal/?ref=search_posts)!\n\nMy ST friend is doing better, he’s almost back to full range of motion and he’s been able to return to work. No more motorcycle, but his new ride is significantly safer.\n\nFinding a game can be hard sometimes, especially with where I live relative to where a majority of the 20s-30s crowd is in my city. A few months ago I found a relatively low key game which was looking for someone to play the villain in an OWoD Camarilla game. So I roll up to the ST like, ‘what up? I got 2000 xp on my sheet, and I’ll make your player’s lives a living hell until they win or die trying.’ She asked if I had any references, I asked if she read r/gametales.\n\nSo the next Saturday I show up at her house early with a folder of sheets, reference notes, and a stack of disposable NPC stat blocks. I go over the plan with her, and giggle with evil excitement. I was told to go easy for the first two games, and then turn up the pressure to about 60%. Piece of cake.\n\nI’ve been there about two hours, and the players are due to arrive shortly, so I take a spin around the block to delay the surprise. I stop at a shop and pick up some game grub, as is customary for a new player to do, and get back about 20 minutes before the start of game. I introduce myself, and as it is so hard to find a game in my area, I know most of the other players by name or reputation, except for John C. McDouchebag, a guy with an ego measured in parsecs. He even introduced himself as “the local asshole”.\n\nI then understood why Lady ST was looking for a villain.\n\nAnd he is right - John is an okay guy, and a complete asshole. Now, I’m all for people being aware of their failings, and appropriately letting others know of their failings in an attempt to fix the problem. *However*, merely announcing “Oh, and I’m an asshole.” to everyone you meet does not allow you to ignore fixing your asshole-ness. That, in fact, makes it worse.\n\nJohn is accustomed to “preparing” people, and then putting the responsibility on them to police him. Given the general nature of most gamers is to be generous with others’ faults, this lead to a fairly decisive rift in the group. Lady ST, knowing all of her players rather well, knew that the temperature of the group was reaching past ‘boiling’ and into ‘clear and present danger’. She had spoken with John, several times, and he had failed to mitigate the issue. Two of the players, Dilton and Trev, had begun to ‘back him up’, in a sense, in that their characters had begun to just allow him to do as he pleased, and followed along in his wake. The third, Sabrina, seething from her character being subject to one too many sexual innuendos, was planning to leave if the shenanigans became any worse.\n\nDuring the first game is when John began having issues with me. While happy to have another player, he was dismayed at my choice of clans and backgrounds. I had two wild ones prepared, which Lady ST knew he would shoot down, one that was even worse than the ‘Assamite from afar’ concept, and one that was a little too straight laced for his style of play. I humored him by taking his objections at face value. The third and fourth more reasonable, both combat/social powerhouses with reasonable and obvious exploits. My humor was running out as he “politely object[ed], based on our current composition” - i.e. he was the combat/social stick, and he didn’t want yet another to muscle in.\n\nLady ST spoke up, “Okay, that’s it. It’s 20 minutes passed start and you’re being difficult. Whatever his next concept is it.”  \nI smiled and nodded, “Well, it has been a while since I played a Tremere.”  \nJohn was not happy, “No way, adding a Tremere would just-”\nLST: “No, John. He wants to play a Tremere, and you shot down his first four - FOUR! - ideas. Tremere is fine.”\n\nThe others maintained their silence, and I suggested that they start the game while I did up my character sheet quick. I make some random scribbles, and five minutes later I handed over my sheet to Lady ST, she gave it a cursory glance - we had already worked out the character ahead of time, the sheet that I had pulled out was more or less complete except for name and a few minor details. She handed it back with a nod and a wink, and we got down to game.\n\nSo Edvin Eyvindr (anyone care to guess what that roughly means?) comes up in the theatre like “HelloMyNameIsEdvinAndIWasSentHereByTheTremereToFurtherMyStudies. PleaseAcceptThisOffering,PrinceSantino,IThinkYouWillFindItToYourLiking.”\n\nNow, say that in one breath, monotone, eyes downcast, with only the slightest of pause on periods and commas. This is how Edvin talks to authority. To spare your eyes, I will try to do that only once or twice per story, as I can. Of course, Edvin told several lies in these two sentences. Okay, just the first one, anyways. He was not here to further his studies, and he was certainly not sent by the Tremere. However, there are no other Tremere in the city at the moment. Promotion! Edvin, by order of succession, was now the Tremere Regent in charge of the city’s Chantry.\n\nEdvin made his introduction, the Prince took a minute to compose himself after such an unusual introduction, and King - John’s characters were all named King, I’m told - decided that Edvin was lying. He was, but that’s not the point. King declared that Edvin was lying, and wanted to roll to confirm. Regardless, Edvin was hurt by the accusation, and responded that he was not lying. They competed, and Edvin came out with more successes. It didn’t hurt that Edvin had more dice to roll than King did.\n\nAnd a lower difficulty.\n\nEdvin was confirmed by the Prince, and King and company were instructed to make nice with the Tremere, especially seeing as none of the other Tremere had made it to Elysium that night. Edvin was convinced that the previous Regent had been handed something from on high, and told to do what was necessary, but he only shared: “The others should only be gone a short while. I will make myself at home in the Chantry while I wait.”\n\nThe game continued with a bit of light politicking, and a single relatively short combat with an Anarch that got “uppity” - i.e. in King’s way - and then a short feeding session before the end of game.\n\nI hung around a while to chat with the other players and get a sense of what they thought the problem was with the situation, and why they thought Lady ST had chosen to add a player so late in the game. Mostly non-committal from King and his two followers, but I was sure that I had let the cat out of the bag to Sabrina. She had a look on her face that was both pensive and knowing, and it scared the crap out of me. It wasn’t until she asked about where I went to college was I able to breath freely again. Thankfully, we had never met before. She was simply mistaken.\n\nThis would not be the last surprise I had to take with a straight face.\n\n* [next &gt;&gt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/6vm0bu/vtm_jalees_kamal_villain_by_proxy_part_2/)",

        "text": "I began playing World of Warcraft like many people did, on the same server as their IRL friends. We started on a server named Magtheridon, a popular PVP server at least partially due to its European counterpart housing some of the best players in the history of the game. This made leveling a chore. You couldn't go to any mid to late game leveling areas without being attacked by maxed out players at least once a day. This was made worse because we were playing Alliance on a largely Horde server. Understandably, a lot of the guild was upset at the state of things. We only had a handful of max level characters, after all, and we were sick of getting ganked. The breaking point came when the first expansion was released, Burning Crusade. Half the guild split, making new Horde characters on an RP server, Sentinels. \n\nI joined Sentinels during BC. I raised a few characters before settling on a undead rogue in the mid game content. That's when a guild mate made an observation. \n\n&gt;\"You ever notice how much more expensive the cloth is on this server? Like wool and silk are worth double what they are on Magtheridon. It's because people like to make RP outfits. You need lots of silk and wool and other mid-level items to craft a lot of cool stuff.\"\n\nThis got the gears turning in my head. If they were willing to pay double, how much more would a server pay? These were RPers, and having the right outfit was super important to many of these people, more important than powerful gear. So I continued to level up, save up my money, and farm as much cloth as I could. Finally, I was ready to strike. I went to the auction house and I bought up every last piece of cloth used to make early to mid game clothes and put up my own at quadruple the price. Then I took the cloth I purchased, sent it to an alt account, and put those up for five times the price, to make my price gouging look \"innocent\". It sold. All of it sold. And I used the massive amount of gold I raked in to do the same with mid level ore. In a single 24 hour period, the whole crafting economy on Sentinels got four times as pricey, and my character went from having a few hundred gold to having thousands. Even worse. It stayed there. Roughly four times as pricey for about a year, but a friend told me later (long after I stopped playing) that it never returned to the prices when I joined that server, and before it was merged with others, prices for mid level cloth were about double what they were when I started. But I wasn't done. No. I'd gotten a taste and it was time to head back to Magtheridon. \n\nMy main was a Mage. I spent a considerable amount of time making money by making portals and shipping other players to different cities in-game. For whatever reason, I chose to be a blacksmith. It was a bad move, Mages get no real benefit from being blacksmiths. An opportunity came around when they announced the next expansion was getting a new crafting system: glyphs. Glyphs required ink to make, so I dropped blacksmithing like a hot potato and picked up herbalism and started farming all the flowers, and carefully buying up high level flowers (but not buying out, as to not cause a price hike) in the few months leading up to the patch. On the eve of WoW patch 3.0, my plan was ready. I dropped mining and was by the crafting trainers with a huge cache of flowers for the new glyph making profession. I let others buy out the flower market. I already had mine. I set my eyes on the glyphs themselves. As far as I'm aware, I was the first person to max out the profession (at least until the new levels were unlocked) and start selling the high level glyphs on Alliance side. And I charged an arm and a leg. I bought up any competitor glyphs and resold them for massive value during the first 24 hours. The level 60-70 glyphs were solely my market for a few days, and I was charging dozens of gold a pop until the bubble burst. I made so much money, I vowed to do it again. \n\nWhen they added in glyph books during Wrath of the Lich King, I took a advantage of the system and bought up all the exclusive glyphs. You see, these books taught you a random special recipe, and you could only get those special recipes from those books. For the first month or so whenever a new glyph showed up, one that I or another seller wasn't already selling, I bought them up and resold them. You wanted a rare glyph? You came to me, or you hoped your guild mates had found it. I owned that market. I controlled the glyph market until I got bored and quit playing Warcraft during Cataclysm, with tens of thousands of gold in my bank. My friends thought I was a monster. I considered myself a capitalist, but what's the difference really? \n\nAll is fair, I guess, because Chinese gold farmers hacked my account multiple times since I quit playing WoW, and I haven't been able to use my Battle.net account ever since, and Blizzard stopped responding to my emails asking to get the account back. \n\nTL:DR - I ruined the crafting economies on two different WoW servers for fun and profit, then got hacked as some sort of divine retribution.",

        "text": "I felt like telling a story today, and this seemed to be the best place to put it.  \n  \nIt happened a decade and change ago, back during the Vanilla days of WoW, roundabouts the 1.3/1.4 patch time, on the small RP server Shadow Council. Back when raiding was done only by those with the dedication to play almost every waking hour, and when only those hale few had the outfits, mounts, and weapons to flash in Ironforge or Org to the awe and wonder of those still climbing the mountain.  \n  \nMy guild was not large, but it was fairly well known for community activism around that time. We organized hours long events in lower end zones to help new players navigate quests and complete events and dungeons (Alliance Assistance Day), we did treasure hunts where we hid people in hard to find places and used in-game lore to give clues...first to find got a prize in gold (and at that time, you usually didn't see your first gold piece until you were in the upper 30s, and the 100 gold for the mount at 40 (10g training, 90g for the mount) looked insurmountable) as well as some crafted or dropped blue gear upgrades, crafting materials, and perhaps a guided/guarded tour of some of the harder content in the zone.  \n  \nOn one of those Alliance Assistance Days, I was gathering materials for a raid I had that evening (I was also part of a 5+ guild coalition that made forays into Molten Core every few days. We rarely got more than 2-3 bosses in, but it was fun, and there were lots of drops and havoc to be had) when I found a man in need.  \n  \nHis son, in his exuberance at his father gathering so much gold, had bought TWO brand new mounts...two of the SAME mount.  \n  \nNow, in WoW, the vendors don't take back overpurchases, so he was stuck 90 gold down and in desperate need. After talking for a bit, he offered to sell it for whatever he could get to try and recoup costs. The best offer anyone could give was about 15 gold, and all of the offers were from max level people who already had mounts, and just wanted to short-change him, so I quietly messaged him and offered 50 to help him out. He gladly accepted, made the trade, and went on his way.  \n  \nWith that new mount, I headed down to Westfall to meet up with my guild, and a plan began to form. You see, we had a few members with...friendly rivalries, shall we say. Most predominantly, an Arms Warrior and a Marksman Hunter, both of whom were CONVINCED that the other would do better in the other class, as their current class and spec was worthless. Both arrived for the event, along with a few rogues, a family of Warriors (father, mother, and son all play Fury Warriors), and a few Hunters.  \n  \nThe day starts off well, quests are being done and people are getting closer to the dungeon that caps the zone, Deadmines, and a few of our higher level people are standing by at the entrance, ready to speedrun people through.  \n  \nEventually, I found a pair of questers, and offered them a deal: Agree to a Player Escort quest (they do NOTHING but follow the other person) and we give them a prize package of a dozen or so gold each, and we let the Warrior and Hunter finally figure out which one is better.  \n  \nWe had a 60 rogue stealthed in each group as a commentator for the run, and one of the rules was that if the escort died, the escorter had to run ALL THE WAY back to the front door to get them before continuing.  \n  \nWe setup a chat channel for the event, and got it started with great fanfare.  \n  \nBoth sides started at a good clip, and the commentators (a husband and wife pair of raiders) gave great play-by-play as they navigated frantically through.  \n  \nAt first, the teams were moving almost at pace, then they started to hit bosses. At the Furnace room, the Warrior lost his charge. He doubled back and charged through, shouting every obscenity he could think of, while the Hunter smugly continued on at a sedate and careful pace.  \n  \nUnfortunately, Mr. Smite had other plans. He cut down the Hunter's charge and required a LOOOOOOONG run back to the front door to retrieve them, which gave the Warrior JUST enough lead time to engage, and crush, Edwin Van Cleef. They rushed through the remaining back half of the ship, including poor Cookie the Murloc, and dove out the back exit of the Mines.  \n  \nWhile waiting for them to finish, we organized the rest of the raid in two columns along the hallway outside the exit, with me at the end. The Warrior emerged to a barrage of cheers and applause, and triumphantly /walked and knelt to receive his coveted mount.  \n  \nThey waited beside me until the Hunter's team exited, to equal cheers and applause, and he graciously accepted his defeat. As they exited the Mines, however, they were met with their final surprise.  \n  \nYou see, the event went on long enough that people in other zones had heard about it, and spread the word. We had listeners from Booty Bay to Menethil Harbor, and Darnassus to Gadgetzan...and easily 200 or more of them had rushed to Westfall to stand in a throng and greet the exiting heroes.  \n  \nThe sight was truly awe inspiring, to see a diverse community come together for no other reason than to celebrate a random player made event...with no reward other than a few screenshots and a great story to tell.  \n  \nEnjoy the little things, they may turn out bigger than you thought.  \n  \nAs an afterward, both the Warrior and the Hunter ended up making alts in the other classes and enjoying them immensely, but neither would give the other the pleasure of saying that aloud.  \nA few of our guild members wandered off to different servers (it was their mantra...one server per year, swapping factions each time) and brought our kit with them, starting Horde Assistance Days and later more Alliance Assistance Days across more than a dozen servers since. Glad the legacy lives on.",

        "text": "[The previous session.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/6lv1n0/tremulus_the_roaring_twenties_part_1/)\n\nOur actors for this evening:  \n***Vincent Yorke***, the artist. A bohemian by choice, Yorke made his first great art portraying the battered and broken veterans returning from the Western Front after the Great War. Only survivor of the White Lion attack. Haunted by the event. Played by Riley.  \n***Sally Sutterfield***, the fiance. Was betrothed to J.G. Wilder after a rather long period of courtship. Sally has been wracked by grief since J.G.’s death. Has gotten his money just the same.  \n***The White Lion***, the abomination. A slippery albino terror that stalked the tall grass, said to be a demon with the power to kill men with a gaze. Many have tried to kill it. All have failed. But now it’s coming to America. It is not happy.  \n***Audrey Ramirez***, the mechanic. A young Latina with a dim attitude on life but a love for assisting her pops at the family garage in Ebon Eaves. Generally grumpy. Played by Lindsey.  \n***‘Claire Voyance’***, the psychic. Operating under this stagename, Claire is an unmarried woman from France who entertains through the ‘mystical’ art of her prophecies. Wants to be respected/loved. Played by Abby.  \n***Mr. Meschin***, the stranger. Operating for ‘the Circus’ as a ‘talent acquisition agent’. Hideous smile and rather grotesque scarring of the face. Frightens children.  \n***Mark Malone***, the bookworm. A young man of Ebon Eaves that lets his mind wander and studies things perhaps best left untouched by mankind. Wholly unprepared for any of this.  \n***Mom and Pops Ramirez***, the parents. One owns the family ice cream parlour. The other the garage. Happily married and very eager for their daughter to chase her dreams. Too innocent for this world.  \n***Ebon Eaves citizens***, the townsfolk. All live in the coastal town of Ebon Eaves, Rhode Island. Stuff doesn’t usually happen here. That’s about to change.  \n***\nIt is May 1920. It has been six months since Vincent Yorke returned from the plains of darkest Africa clutching his dead friend’s rifle and hearing the shouts of the damned. Upon arriving Vincent moved away from his native Providence RI to the much more quiet Ebon Eaves, in the shadow of J.G. Wilder’s old summer home. Setting up in his small apartment, Vincent refused to speak of the expedition besides declaring that Wilder had been a madman for departing and attempting such a reckless and arguably suicidal task. Locked away with his paintings, chief of all the ghoulish postmortem portrait he made of Jimmy DeWitt, he sweated and toiled this time away, tapped by clients to create art. He sent some money to Sally Sutterfield to ensure he held up his promise to the expedition crew back in Africa. It does nothing to dampen the nightmares.\n\nAnd now the nightmare is coming home. Though the international uproar of J.G. Wilder’s death was at most only relevant for a week or so, a large outcry from the big game hunting community was determined to hunt down and conquer the man-killer. So it was that large roving bands used airplanes, armored cars, high-powered rifles, tracking dogs, local guides, and any savory or unsavory tactic under the sun. Its territory razed by flames. Its den quarantined and starved out. It had almost been too easy.\n\nNow successful, the White Lion mulls in a cage. It has been brought over from Africa to be displayed as a living trophy at a rather extravagant event on the yard of J.G. Wilder’s summer estate at Ebon Eaves. Vincent is not thrilled at this news, and is even more opposed to the request to attend the event and painting a portrait of the snow-white terror. But eventually, for the memory of his dead friends, gives in and agrees. It will be a rather raucous day full of fun, fireworks, and good time. Theoretically.\n\nThe Lion is brought by truck, having arrived in Providence and kept in its cage. A hefty tarp conceals it until the proper time at the ceremony, but the sound of it clattering and shaking inside is unmistakable. Neither is the scent of sweat, wet fur, and dung. The ceremony will be started by town officials who will call Ms. Sutterfield to the podium for a short but surely emotionally charged speech. Then Vincent will give a small send off to his departed friend and the maintenance crew will pull the tarp free as the band kicks into a rousing song. Wheeled onto a flatbed truck, the caged beast will then be driven through the town and on to Providence for study and captivity. Several circuses are bidding on the right to own this curious specimen, as well as zoos in the area.\n\nThe crowds of townspeople gather, as well as press officials from the larger centers of civilization like Providence, Boston, and Arkham. We find Audrey leaning against a light pole as the throngs of people push through the streets towards the town green. Claire happens to be standing next to her, having left her boarding house to examine the proceedings. She explains rather passionately that she had foreseen the capture of the beast and wanted to attend the event to ensure that her prediction was, as always, 100% correct. Audrey is unimpressed until a rather ragged man muttering to himself and clutching an easel parks his bike at their pole. The young woman spouts out at the man for blocking her view and taking her spot. Claire backs her up.\n\nVincent, whose mind has been slowly undoing all of the hard work the Providence therapist had put into it over half a year, snapped at the women. Waving arms and drooling a bit, he cast them aside verbally and stalked towards the stage. Claire remembered reading the newspaper articles that talked of the ill-fated trip to Africa and realized this man was Vincent Yorke. Audrey is unimpressed. Ever paranoid and knowing these two women now recognized him, Vincent took his bike away and brought it behind the wooden staging erected in the village green. He took his place at the creaky metal chair arranged for the guests of honor.\n\nAt about 11:30am the ceremony started. Sally thanked everyone that could attend and also extended her thankfulness to the brave men and women that had captured the beast, which had amounted to no less that three casualties and at least triple the amount wounded. She talked of her deceased lover and knew that he would be proud that this thing had been found and brought to proverbial justice. After all, mankind can conquer all. She started to break down and cry, and bid everyone to the next speaker...Vincent.\n\nVincent declined to speak.\n\nTo counter the awkward pause in front of the two hundred-odd people, the mayor quickly butted in and ordered the maintenance crew to pull away the tarp. The band kicked up with a jaunty rendition of the Star Spangled Banner. The faded fabric lilted on the green vibrant grass and the crowd gasped. The beast roared and the sound seemed to shake the bones of all present. It was clearly no normal beast of Africa, at least twice the size of a usual example. Pure white fur and mane with blazing red eyes of a usual albino pigment. It stalked and slammed against the iron bars that kept it from the delectable prey that just lay fifty yards away. Several members of the crowd started to broadcast their worry and back away, despite the promises of the maintenance team and mayor.\n\nClaire was instantly taken aback. This thing could not have been created by God, for the horrible unnatural aura that it gave off was a thing of terrible alienness. Vincent glowered at the old enemy that had haunted him ever since that fateful day. Audrey rolled her eyes at the obviously amateur puppetry work from the crew hiding beneath the stage, because that thing was so fake it was insulting.\n\nAnger and a taste for vengeance burned through Vincent’s veins. He mounted the podium and quickly ushered everyone away. There was a lot of confusion as the maddened artist ranted and raved for everyone to leave so he may ‘work in private’. The schedule had called for the maintenance crew to parade the beast on the back of a truck, but the wild-eyed artist chased them away with the promise that he’d been done in an hour. Audrey headed back home to the garage. Claire meandered along the commons to the coffeehouse for a quick drink and perhaps the attention of a young man.\n\nVincent started working half-heartedly, not even finishing the rough outlines of the beast before he stopped. Because he had a plan. And the timeline had just shortened itself. While he had been content with killing the beast later during the cover of night, he needed to act now before it could be transported far and away from him. He tossed the paint-stained canvas to the ground and brought out his DeWitt portrait, setting it up so that it may stare at the beast. He challenged and mocked it, telling it of the eventual demise at his own hands. The White Lion seemed disinterested.\n\nAudrey returned home to find her Pops in the garage working on Old Lady Wilkes jalopy. He welcomed his daughter back with a warm smile and the quick retort to get back to work. Her only break had been to see the lion and it didn’t matter if she was, as were her own words, disappointed in the display. Another customer pulled up and exited their black sedan. He was a tall, almost gaunt man with what seemed like burn scars or facial rash on the right side of his face. He walked with a purpose and introduced himself as a Mr. Meschin, and he needed someone to look at his car. Audrey agreed to check it out and received his business card. She got a bad feeling from him, watching with some distrust as he got into an entirely separate sedan.\n\nMeanwhile Vincent moved to the tall, long package he had taken with him to the ceremony. Inside lay DeWitt’s rifle. He chambered a round and glared at the lion, who had fallen asleep in the most mocking of fashion. Then the stage creaked. A tall gaunt man with facial scarring and slicked back silver hair stood waiting. Three associates stood close by. All were dressed in suits. All seemed to share the same apathetic expression. The gaunt man introduced himself as Mr. Meschin from 'the circus'. His employers were interested in the White Lion for its 'unique entertainment'. Vincent told them, in no uncertain terms, to shove off and leave him alone. After a tense session of staring they obliged, but made no effort to hide the fact they were watching him from their car.\n\nAt the coffeeshop Claire drank her favorite blend and discovered a book left behind by a previous attendee, titled *Avedissian*. It seemed to be full of odd scientific notation that was beyond her ability to comprehend. Scrawled on the inside cover was the name ‘Mark Malone’, and with having nothing to do Claire decided to return the book. Using the help of the Providence operator she managed to get the home number and called right away. A different man answered, but it turned out to be Stephen Malone, Mark’s older brother. He told Claire that he would send his little brother over to the coffeehouse to pick up his book and that she should chide him into being more responsible. The French psychic left the book and a note with the waitress and left to explore more of Ebon Eaves. She found her way to the front of the garage and called out to Audrey, who she had remembered seeing at the parade. Audrey directed her to the inside of the ice cream parlour, where Mrs. Ramirez was more than willing to dote upon her only customer of the night.\n\nVincent screamed at the White Lion, demanding that it show some shred of evidence that it could perceive what was about to befall it. It blinked at him with Jimmy DeWitt’s eyes.\n\nInside the garage Audrey found the leak in the fuel line of Mr. Meschin’s sedan. She rolled out from underneath it to find a patch kit.\n\nInside the ice cream parlour Claire tried pistachio ice cream for the first time.\n\nMr. Meschin and his associates watched Vincent worriedly.\n\nMark Malone was walking to the coffeehouse to get his book.\n\nAverage citizens walked the sidewalk, enjoying the nature of Ebon Eaves commons and the pleasant spring evening.\n\nThen it all changed.\n\nVincent lurched back, hands scrabbling for the rifle. He jutted the barrel right against the beast’s face, smack dab between those piercing eyes that had belonged to his friend. It goaded him, mocked him to shoot and end it. It used the voice of the dead, of Jimmy DeWitt and J.G. Wilder. Mr. Meschin and his associates were shouting at Vincent. The voices of the dead filled the artist’s ears. The latch of the cage opened.\nVincent shrieked the sound of a man being dragged to his death, flying into action and clubbing the lion’s face with the butt of the rifle. Mr. Meschin and friends were rushing towards the stage, pulling free slick black pieces of violence from inside their suit jackets. The lion roared a thousand terrible shrill voices, like some flute section of demons. Its face fell apart into a slurry mess as Vincent hammered at its muzzle. The head soon gibbered and slid apart, the hinge of the jaw moving too far back. Thick ropey tendrils of black dripping ichor shot free from the neck stump and started pushing the cage away. The metal strained under the unnatural assault.\n\nMr. Meschin and crew stood their ground at the foot of the stage, watching in mute horror as Vincent stumbled away from the shifting beast. Sloshing like water and now blinking through an unnatural amount of fetid eyes the thing slide up the bars to the roof of the cage and leapt free like a column of swamp water. Vincent slid away across the rough wooden surface of the stage and the thing leaked through the cracks onto the grass, knocking over the Jimmy DeWitt portrait at the same time. Vincent quickly rushed to help his ‘wounded’ friend.\n\nAudrey, Pops, and Claire walked outside to hear what the commotion was. Other onlookers were horrified at **whatever** stomped with sloppy footing across the stage. It held the shape of a lion but its fur was shiny and glowing as if reflecting the light. And the eyes!\n\nPops grabbed his wrench and ordered Audrey to call the police, fearing that the lion had escaped and murdered again. He started running over as Claire followed suite. A few other brave, or foolhardy, souls were in the process of corralling the ‘lion’ as it soaked through the wood and started to snake through the grass like a flash flood of obsidian evil. The lion form was taken again, lashing out at the crowd. Claire bumped into Mark Malone and ordered him inside the coffeehouse for his own safety. Ever the gentleman, he demanded that he would either follow Claire into whatever danger lay in the commons or see her into the coffee house as well. The psychic ran off and the man followed.\n\nAudrey rushed to her father’s sides as the echoes of the police sirens wailed eerily off the facades of all the stores surrounding the commons. He held his young daughter back, not sure what horrific sight lay in front of them. Claire and Mark stood not too far, holding each-other.\n\nA nervous police officer, sweating and desperately wishing for back-up, came skidding from his still running cruiser with a revolver drawn. He leveled it at the beast. It turned its head. Or at least seemed to. Its head and tail switched places by messily sliding along the surface of the body until raw spittle and hate roared at the nervous rookie. He started screaming and opened fire.\n\nAll six bullets struck the beast and none had an effect. As the cop turned to run the lion became a glossy puddle. A tendril of nightmarish proportions leapt from the grass and clutching the fleeing lawman’s ankle. His neck might’ve been snapped against the hard ground before he fully vanished in the chittering mass of eyeballs and mocking jaws.\n\nEveryone present soon felt that cold touch of primal fears inside. Fleeing was the only option. As more police sirens cried to the heavens Claire and Mark leapt through the door of the coffeehouse, slamming it behind them and forcing everyone to cower behind the counter. Audrey and Pops fled into the garage, slamming the heavy steel doors behind them. Pops, fully overwhelmed by the situation, babbled in Spanish to his wife to lock all the doors. Perhaps feeling like a knight of old, Vincent grabbed the DeWitt portrait like his shield and ran at the creature as it stalked for more prey. He shouted for J.G. to get the gun and help him, which fell on deaf empty streets.\n\nAudrey peered inside the parlour to see if her mother had complied with the feverish commands and cried out in terror. Her mother and spotted a fallen bowl in the street, one dropped by Claire when she rushed outside. It was so expensive to have such nice things for the family business, because it was struggling in such a deadbeat town. She needed to get it back.\n\nShe walked into the street.\n\nAudrey ran into the door in her attempt to stop her mother, and heard the horrific shriek. A panicked motorist was careening in reverse down the narrow road, slamming into cars and creating quit the havoc as the glistening pool of ink chased it. The car struck Mrs. Ramirez and sent her colliding into another car. She cried out in pain, her legs suddenly useless. She was only scant yards away from her daughter, who rushed outside to help her.\n\nLiquid death was upon them. Audrey felt some comfort in her hand. She had unknowingly grabbed her father’s pistol from inside the garage. He had always intended to use it if there was trouble. The young girl raised the handgun and pulled the trigger two times. The first struck the tarmac. The second struck the parked car. This had been one damaged by the fleeing motorist, the side crumbled and destroyed. Fuel leaked from underneath.\n\nThe roar of the conflagration was joined and soon surpassed from the horrific bone-shattering uluation of the demonic slime. Audrey and her mother were pressed against the ground as the stifling heat overwhelmed them and bathed the street in a brilliant display of sunrays. The thing cried and lashed and protested as it burned, slipping and falling into the storm drains. Audrey and her mother watched in horror as the last few dripping remnants chattered and made obscene sucking noises. Then there was nothing. Vincent approached and congratulated ‘J.G.’, in actuality Audrey, on her fine shooting and left for home.\n\nThe police scoured the street for nearly thirty minutes, urging everyone to stay inside their homes. Once it was deemed clear the town officials were confused as to where the ‘wild animal’ had gone to. All the witnesses reported that the lion had escaped and mauled at least one man, but there were no tracks to follow. In fact, there were no signs of the lion at all. Or its victim(s). The cage was stripped clean of even dust or hair particles. Still on high alert, but ultimately puzzled by the turn of events, the police moved their search elsewhere.\n\nAudrey went to work on Mr. Meschin’s car. It was a simple fix but took the girl nearly six hours as she kept losing track of herself after the events of the past few hours. Claire sat and talked with Mark Malone at the coffeehouse for about an hour, enjoying the free coffee that the owner gave to everyone. The two parted ways but Mark hoped to see her again in less stressful circumstances. And troubled Vincent sat alone in the dark, staring at the portrait of Jimmy DeWitt as he hung it back up. A jagged black scar cut across the man’s face. Man can conquer all.\n\nAnd not to far from the commons, a slimy proboscis floated its way from a storm-drain. A  feeble rat’s eye poking out into the world. Underneath Ebon Eaves the Thing waited and rested, feeding on vermin and enjoying the dripping darkness of the sewers. For it was old and wise, and knew that it can conquer all.",

So one weekend we load up and drive 12 hours to a game we had heard of that had a long history and good reviews. \n\nThere were some max lvl characters who were assholes to us right from the start. It was on of those \"my character is an asshole so you can't take it personal\" situations. For me though, the character is an asshole because you chose to make them one... so you reap what you sow. \n\n**My Character**\n\n* Race: Half Fae, neat little racial thievery ability that gives you a special article of clothing with an extradimensional pocket where you can store any object you can carry for 10 minutes. (pretty important since there were low level magics for tracking items to prevent theft)\n* Class: Alchemist, starts with any potions they have the starting gold to buy. The GMs gave us a bunch of extra starting gold since we were travelling so far so we thought taking advantage of this class was a good idea. \n* Potion of Feign Death: half the cost of potions of healing. \"The imbiber dies for 10 minutes and is then restored to full health.\"  \n\n**item of note** buddy was playing some kind of catman and loved to freak out strangers by eating raw beef. so he had a cooler of steaks in our cabin.\n\nSince the awesome campsite had lots of cabins, each crew of players got their own. You even have a GM come by and put an IC \"lock\" on your door to keep thieves and assassins out (not a physical lock, just a note to see a GM).\n\nNow on the first night of the game these dickhead old time players thought they did not need to follow the set rules on ranged weapons in the dark. The end result was one of their crossbows (tuned to fire a \"safe\" bolt about 40 meters) accidentally going off and hitting my GF point blank in the temple. They pseudo apologized and laughed it off, she spent the rest of the weekend in our cabin with a concussion (we did not recognize the symptoms, this was some time ago). I was pissed at them and ended up adventuring by myself most of that weekend.\n\nWell, apparently the team running the game had recently found themselves in possession of a large number of adult animal costumes. So that meant a circus came to town and the animals escaped. It was a fun concept for a day module and had folks scattered all over to get the rewards for returning whatever they could catch. \n\nIn this game, if you die you drop your gear and go tell the people at the registration table and then walk back to your body and are immediately revived. If you are low level there is little to no consequence to death so long as your gear is still there when you get back. At higher levels you can actually lose a significant amount of \"stuff\" (experience point loss and things like that). So one guy gets trampled by a rhino and goes off to record his demise. I watch as a half fae scoops up his body and slaps it in the fae pocket on her cloak. Pretty funny to see the guy lose it for a while when the GMs tell him his body is gone and that if he does not find it soon he is permadead. Pranks. She gave him back his body and we all laughed. \n\nExcept for the max lvl crew who could give a shit about the coppers we were excited about and decided to spend the heat of the day in their cabin. Not a bad idea since sunlight turns layers of furs, chainmail, and metal into a slow cooker.\n\nEven though it was the middle of the day on the Saturday, the stars aligned. I was walking through the tall grass and hear a roar. I find a sickly starving old lion. I run back to my cabin and grab a steak, douse it with a Potion of Feign Death and toss it to the beast. As soon as he swallows the meat I put the dead lion in my fae cloak pocket and race to the cabin of the jerks. With a GM watching I put my own lock on the only door and push my cloak through the small open window at the back of the cabin. \n\nA few minutes later and a full strength lion apparates into the middle of the jerks' cardgame. None of them were wearing armor and by the time they figured out the door was locked from the outside it was too late. \n\nWe never made the trip out there again, but we saw on their forums that a new set up rules updates had come out with some interesting changes to how potions, locks, and fae pockets worked. Thankfully they also banned crossbows outright.",

        "author": "batikartist",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/6szery/eclipse_phase_comet_express_episode_1the_basement/",
        "text": "Warning: wall of text ahead. Before the actual story, a bit of context on the system Eclipse Phase: it’s a largely story-based rpg, using a D100 system for most checks. The universe is set far in the future from our own, and specifically ten years after an event called the Fall, where most of humankind was wiped out by super AIs called TITANs. Many of the machines and mutants created by these TITANs still exist, but the actual AIs are all gone now. From the ashes of that Fall, giant corporations were quick to pick up the pieces and install themselves as the powers in our solar system (without FTL drives, humanity is mostly limited to the Sol system). With the exception of the Jovian Republic (a bio-conservative dictatorship, essentially), there aren’t governments anymore. A big part of this system though is that bodies (sleeves) can be made and upgraded, and “egos” (the mind of a person) can be saved and/or transferred to new bodies. The actual players are working for a company called Comet Express, and are being sent on a delivery run, right through Jovian-controlled space. No one knows why, but the Jovians shoot down every single Comet Express ship they see.\n\nFrom the beginning, these guys have been plagued with problems. They decided to go stealthy and chose the fastest, most maneuverable, stealthy ship they could from the selections I gave them. However, in a random encounter on the way there, a small space rock blew through one of their engines, effectively eliminating any bonuses they had. Knowing that if they got into a firefight they’d be done for, they decided to land on a nearby outpost that their assistant AI, Hans (basically a tutorial bot that has to be manually allowed to do anything but can freely converse with them), told them was nearby.\n\nOnce landing on the asteroid that housed Ulviq Station, they entered and looked for some way to repair their ship, finding the station curiously empty. After some time, they found a hidden hatch to a basement level and entered. One of the party members would choose not to enter here and instead pulled a table over the hatch, so he wasn’t there for the basement session. I did a private session with him to try to convince him to go into the basement, but that didn’t work and so he just controlled half of the monsters with me during the normal session. I might share his story at a later point since his character is a nut job, but that’s a different story. And these monsters were nasty. The basement beasts (or Children) were about the size of a person that looked almost like a scorpion-xenomorph, it saw through clicks and smell, and attempted to paralyze anything they could grab onto to be converted into further Children (and just to add a bit of flair, they had rudimentary speech capabilities, so every so often players could hear things about the Children converting the bad meat soon). Upon killing and opening up these things they seemed mostly alien, with some shriveled up human organs.\n\nInside the basement, they quickly learned that they would need four codes to escape, and so set to searching, already very wary as they found a dismembered corpse and heard clicking echoing throughout the rooms. Nothing really happened, until they split up, even though they had promised to stick together as it seemed too much like a horror movie (the lights were out, they were finding their way by using the screen lights of their portable tablets, and they were locked in a small, confined space). However, as soon as three of them stayed in the kitchen area to investigate the supplies while the other looked through the adjoining bedroom, the one in the bedroom (Onuf) saw one clumsily crawl out of a vent towards him. In what would be his only attack that hit this night, he stabbed the thing in the head. It was an impressive attack and Onuf wounded the thing badly, but another beast he didn’t notice jumped on his back, digging its claws in. Screaming for help, two of the three other players came running around the corner, just in time for the last player (Aiat) to jump beneath a desk that we had just hidden a beast under, with one more in the vents about to jump out. In an amazing feat of athleticism, Aiat stopped just before the maw could close on their face, getting on top of the table instead. This was in time for the guide of the group (Charles Snippy) to get around the corner where Onuf was and shoot the thing on his back, which collapsed, dead. As the last player (George) raced forward to kill it with his axe (keep in mind this man is basically the stat equivalent of a researcher/accountant), Onuf pulled his knife out to prepare for another stab as Charles shot the wounded one.\n\nThis had all happened in several seconds, and it gave the group enough time to turn around and see Aiat nimbly dodge two beasts as they jumped towards Aiat. Aiat was only armed with a fairly useless kitchen knife at this point, so was quite busy dodging. But Charles took aim with his sniper again, and shot one nearly dead, and so it fell to the floor, twitching. George then took his axe, screaming, running towards this beast…and tripped on the floor, missing entirely, landing next to a vent. Seeing the kitchen area fairly full, Onuf wisely decided at this point to just root through the dishes, eventually chucking them inside vents. As Aiat attempted to take the axe (failing), and then attempted to stab with their knife (failing), the beast sensed it was outnumbered and ran past George into the vent. George saw this and prepared to deliver a final killing blow…and missed, smashing the axe into the floor. \n\nLater on, the whole group was moving on to another room, and somehow ended up getting split up again. As Charles nimbly dodged a stinger coming out of a vent towards him (which got stuck in the vent as it tried to pull back), he dropped to the ground and prepared a shot. Aiat was so focused on this they didn’t notice a beast creep up behind them and plant a stinger right into their calf, pumping it full of some sort of venom. Onuf heard something in the next room and tried to go into a rage (he’s just a supervisor…sorry, I mean boss), running into the room with his knife and gun prepared-and running straight into another beast. Onuf’s attack did miss entirely, but the beast’s certainly didn’t, putting Onuf into unconsciousness and almost to death. Meanwhile, Charles had shot the beast in the vent and Aiat was attempting to get their internal nanobots to root out the paralyzing venom, all with a stinger still in their legs (they managed to get the venom to temporarily stop working, but it was still in their veins). Turning around, Charles shot the thing attached to Aiyat, blowing it to smithereens. \n\nAfter investigating their own wounds, they then realized they had heard Onuf scream and then quickly go silent, and so decided to investigate, and found him being dragged into a vent, with only his knees and lower legs still visible. After some discussion among themselves about whether he was worth saving (and also upon seeing him slip in up to his ankles), Charles estimated where he might not be, and took an incredible shot through the wall, directly hitting the beast, and nearly killing it. At this point they both heard a scream from the kitchen area, where they suddenly realized that they had no idea where George was. While Charles promised to deal with this beast, Aiat went running off towards George.\n\nRewinding a bit, George had decided to see if the group was hungry, and also if the beast would leave him alone if he made them some meat. Leaving the group, he went to the kitchen and started preparing steaks, using the food prep machine. While a crazy fight was going on in the other room, he basically just stood there and watched a microwave while his friends were in danger. It was going great, and he’d prepared six steaks, until another beast jumped on him, immediately attempting to dig its stinger into his cheek. The stinger dug in, but through sheer force of will George cut off any blood flow in his cheek, preventing the venom from spreading and forcing a lot of it out. By this time Aiat showed up and attempted to stab the beast (to which it crawled all the way around George to avoid it), then attempted to do so again (to which it again avoided the knife by crawling around his body back to the original position). What ensued was a slightly comical (slightly horrendous) scene as this beast crawled all around George while George fed it steaks (and so ignoring George unless there was a steak to be fed to it), and the beast and Aiat getting into an ineffective duel, which was ended as Charles showed up again to blast this thing off of George’s shoulder (using Onuf’s unconscious body as a mount for the gun). This was the last of the beasts (which they would find out soon), and so they soon felt they could relax and begin searching for the codes earnestly.\n\nAfter some time they found the codes and prepared to leave the basement, but not before doing some of their own work with the equipment and tools they had found. During this time, Aiyat touched a squirming pile of goop on the floor that was in the same place as one of the dead beasts. Luckily this player was wearing an enviro-suit, so the goop only attached to their gloves, and before it could travel too far up their arms the suit was removed and locked away. Aiyat also made another mistake which will likely have long term repercussions on the party, but they don’t know it yet. Remember those TITANs I mentioned earlier? Well they found an archived copy of one in a huge database, right next to a computer with files on it (which they declined to check out since that sounded boring). They were supposed to figure out it was a TITAN fairly easily, but instead they just figured out it was a super AI (which at least they were smart enough not to interface with). After some manual communication through audible binary (to prevent opening a mind to attack), that AI convinced the party to take a copy of itself with them rather than leaving it alone on this asteroid for the next thousand or so years. So now the party has an inert copy of the most malicious parts of a TITAN stored in a memory card, and it’s just looking for any opportunity to get its full-self free. If all goes according to this thing’s plan, these players have literally doomed the entire Sol-system, and every person in it.\n\nTL; DR: Players worked into my hands in a setting they knew was horror, some shenanigans ensued, and they have freed a copy of the super AI that nearly wiped out humanity.",

        "text": "Hi again everyone, I know I submitted a story less than 24 hours ago, but that dredged up so many memories, and since it coincides with the 9th anniversary of losing my father, I wanted to share with you a few different gaming stories involving him that you may enjoy. These stories don't focus so much on the gameplay itself, but the bonding of a father and son over a shared love of games.\n\n[Madden 92, Sega Genesis]\n\nMy dad's house was central for gaming during this time. A few other kids and other adults would frequently stop by for gaming sessions, usually with whatever football game we had managed to acquire. We were constantly at war with Madden '94 on Genesis. Constant bouts of back and forth between me and my dad. Sometimes I'd barely win, sometimes he'd barely win, and then he started a streak of completely blowing me out time and time again.\n\nWell I started practicing when he wasn't around. I studied the playbook, I practiced what I thought would work and wouldn't work, and I took my dad's playstyle into effect. It came time for my weekend with him (my parents split when I was super young), and I was ready. \n\nThe time came. I picked the best non-allstar team I could (can't even remember who I chose) and we threw down. My father being the considerate dad he was, decided to pause the game in progress occasionally to cook us a nice stir fry dinner. What followed was my father's usual bombastic whooping and yelling that would follow his ass beatings going completely silent as I ran up and down the field as if he weren't there. He grew progressively more and more angry each time he got up to check on the food, until the final score flashed up \"64-3\" and he went to fix us a couple plates.\n\n\"Ha! I won I won! You can't beat me! Yeah yeah yeah!\" in classic 11 year old annoying asshole fashion. I turned the corner mid \"HAH! I BEAT YOU! YOU SUCK!\" and he flung a splatula full of hot stir fry at me...which I promptly ducked. He made me scrub it off the wall, but that didn't make me stop giggling.\n\nA couple days later we had bowls of cereal at 1am, and laughed ourselves stupid just staring at that grease spot...that remained there until he moved 4 years later.\n\n[Christmas '95] \n\nI expected nothing from my father for Christmas. He hit a rough patch with finances, and there were a few weekends I couldn't go visit him because he couldn't feed me, or didn't have heat. I come over to his house after having Christmas with mom and the grandparents...and he hands me a wrapped box. I hesitate, because it's the size and weight of a games console. I look at him, and he just smiles down at me and tells me to open it. I quickly rip off the packaging...and a Sega Saturn is staring back at me. We (and I mean 'WE') eagerly took it out, hooked it up, and got to playing.\n\n[Virtua Fighter 2]\n\nMy dad never liked fighting games. I was always playing Street Fighter, or Mortal Kombat (or Eternal Champions or a similar title), and he didn't like the characters, or the fighting, or whatever. Well, I convinced him to rent me a copy of Virtua Fighter 2 on Saturn. I had seen it in the arcade, and never got to really play it before, and after the insanely positive reviews in gaming magazines, I was HYPED to play it.\n\nI had no idea what I had unleashed. My father watched intently as I played this new 3D fighter. He liked the design of the characters, he liked the realistic fighting styles, and more. For the first couple days we did literally nothing BUT play Virtua Fighter. I mean hours upon hours upon hours, from dawn til dusk. It was with a heavy heart that we returned that game to Blockbuster.\n\nOh but this story continues. Shortly thereafter we got hit with a massive blizzard. I'm talking school out for a week blizzard, and my dad couldn't work, much less even get there. But guess what? We pooled enough money together to buy Virtua Fighter, and once it thawed out enough for *some* people to get to work, he trudged a mile up the road in nearly a foot of snow to Circuit City to buy the game. The rest is bloody and competitive history.\n\nThere are lots of other little things here and there, because a lot of gaming I did during my formative years was with him. I wanted to take a moment to share a bit of that with you as I remember it. Thanks for reading!",

It was a druid tauren from the guild Battlegrounders.. His name was private. \n\nI was a dwarf priest exploring the barrens and visiting crossroads. I was alone, when i met a strange and large creature. I tried to wave but was met with a staff to my head. I died once, twice and after my priest had been ressurected 17 times i stopped counting. Minuttes turned to hours before i gave up for the day, unable to meet up with my friends ingame. Managed to play for 1 hour and 15minuttes the following day before he found me again and proceded to waste both our evenings. \n\nWeeks went by and my character became one of the best equiped priests in the game. I had several friends on the horde side whom would feed me intel on private and battlegrounders. Everytime i could kill and camp them i would. \n\nWe had some brush-ins with Nihilium (when they were ranked 1 worldwide) were we would camp their maintank and they would all leave the instance just to crush us with numbers:^) \n\nAfter nearly 1 year i get a message from a horde friend that battlegrounders are changing faction to alliance! Fuck, what was i supposed to do now? \n\nSeveral months went by and most guilds had BWL on farm. Battlegrounders had just managed to finish molten core and the first boss in BWL. \n\nBy now i had a plan, i would destroy my reputation and my own pve clan would probably shun me.

I sent private a message and told him i felt bad about the previous night. I gave him my login details for my priest and told him to enjoy him as i was quiting the game. \n\nI waited two long weeks before i took my priest back...! \"Private\" had added a new gamecard on my account(yay free gaming!) and made my priest gm of the guild. I disbanded the guild and sent \"private\" a message asking if he remember camping me all those years ago.. \n\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/6sva9m/mtg_outcheating_the_cheater/",
        "text": "This involves a somewhat popular card-based trading game, Magic the Gathering (MtG). I tried to strip out as many unnecessary details as possible to make it easy to read. Plus, I don’t remember them all.\n\nI usually am not the one to take revenge since I’m risk-averse. However, in this case, I found it was the most logical thing to do since I knew ahead of time that the other guy was going to try and screw me.\n\nThere was this fellow in my high school. His name was David. He was one grade above me and he was a complete asshole, a compulsive liar and a compulsive cheater.\n\nOften times during lunch hour, students would get together at the tables to play card games and such. I usually got involved in these games as well. David did too, but not as often.\n\nWhen he did, I watched him. Honestly, this kid fascinated me since he was completely blatant about his lying and cheating. I remember distinctly watching him play a game of Magic: The Gathering with another student and I would watch him take 2, 3, even 4 cards at a time when he should have only been drawing 1. His opponent was completely oblivious to this and was so concerned about her own cards to really pay attention to what David was doing. I just kept my mouth shut. Pretty soon he had something like 20 cards in his hand while his opponent had 4-5. It was very ridiculous.\nI usually avoided playing with him, but I must have played with him at least once. He would continue to cheat in the open until you called him on it. Of course, he would try to lawyer himself out of it or tell me I got it wrong. He would try to change the rules of the game to benefit him in the moment for his specific situation. He would throw a fit if you tried to argue and would only back down if you got the whole audience to agree unanimously that he was wrong. Playing him was an exhausting experience since you spend more time arguing and watching him than playing the game.\n\nIt was 1995 at the time, and I had played some Magic: The Gathering (MTG). I was nearly finished with this game since all the great expansions came out before I even got involved, and people with money held all the power cards. I had dropped my own money in the new expansion “Fallen Empires”, which turned out to be one of the worst expansions ever made in the game’s history. Therefore, I was pretty sour and was basically giving up the game since I didn’t see how I could ever catch up.\n\nA guy I knew, Alex, decided to organize a starter pack tournament, where the players had to compete with only the cards they got with the starter pack. This sounded like an interesting variation on the game, and I thought I might join to try and squeeze some fun out of this game I was quickly losing interest in.\n\nIncidentally, David joined this tournament. Now, his reputation was well known by Alex, but he let David join anyway. The logic being that he needed people, even if those people were assholes. There was only something like 5 people in the tournament so it was hard to argue with that.\nCan you guess whom my first match was against? That’s right. It was fuckface himself: David. Now, I didn’t want to lawyer and argue with David the whole game since that was no fun at all. If I was going to play him, I wanted to completely royally screw him over and embarrass him in front of the whole player tournament. A sort of preemptive revenge for the shit I know he was going to pull on me.\n\nKnowing that he was going to cheat ahead of time gave me some unique opportunities. I felt it relieved me of any ethical obligation to play a fair game. I needed to stack the deck in my favor, so to speak. Let me explain what I did.\n\nSo, each player was given a starter pack and one booster pack (MTG Revised Edition for those who care). This gave you an assortment of cards that made overall fairly weak decks. Most games resulted in waiting for the person to get enough land to play a monster and start doing damage against their opponent. Any sizeable monster in play usually results in that player winning since our decks were so weak.\n\nIn order to give yourself a chance of getting the right cards, you need to strip out all the fluff that was going to do you no good. So your cards were divided into your active playing deck and your reject pile. You only played with your active deck. At the end of the game, the winner gets to draw at random a card to keep from the loser’s active deck or your reject pile. It’s the winner’s choice. This is important later.\n\nMy deck had an unusually useful card for this sort of tournament called a Demonic Tutor. It essentially lets you go through your own deck and pick out the exact card you want. If I ever got this card, it would be my key to winning since I could pick out the only monster I have that actually does damage. So now I have two chances of winning. If I draw my monster or draw the Demonic Tutor.\n\nDavid also had an unusually useful card in his deck as well. I think it was some kind of rare card and he cherished it so much. I don’t remember what card it was, but I remember it did him no good against me. My goal was to completely win the match and then pilfer his Precious Rare “at random”.\nTo prepare, I took my uberpowerful Demonic Tutor card and oh so gently, put a tiny fold in the top right corner of the card. This way, if you put it in a deck, you can see it stand out from all the other cards. You only see this if you know what to look for.\n\nWhen we met for our match, we get to browse each other’s cards so we know what to expect. I browsed through his deck and took out his Precious Rare to admire. While David was too busy looking through my cards, I put the same tiny fold in his rare card and put it back in his deck. I didn’t have time to check if it stood out, so I crossed my fingers.\n\nNext we shuffled our cards. Since I could see where my Demonic Tutor was, I shuffled it carefully so that it was below the 75% mark in my deck. So when he cut my deck, there’s a good chance that the Demonic Tutor would end up near the top. If I didn’t end up getting this card, I have a second chance of getting the monster instead.\n\nLuckily, when he cut my deck, he cut it above my Demonic Tutor’s location, so I was good to go in that department. Next, I cut his deck, but since I could see where his Precious Rare was located, I made sure to cut the deck so that his card was as close to the bottom as possible and wouldn’t show up during the match. David was too self-absorbed to suspect that anyone other than himself might have evil intentions.\n\nThings are going well so far, and I’m starting to feel bad for David. I’m starting to question whether what I’m doing is the right thing. These doubts are quickly erased by subsequent events.\n\nWe start to play. My job here at this point was to watch him like a hawk and call him out every time he tries to cheat. And try he did. He tried to do the whole multiple card-draw on me. I called him out on it. David tried to act like it was an accident. This got the tournament organizer’s attention and David a verbal tongue lashing from Alex.\n\nAlex basically told David to stop acting like an asshole and play the game. This had the effect of crucially destroying David’s credibility and getting everyone in the room on my side. I shined a spotlight on his douchey ways, so to speak.\n\nNext thing he did was try to lawyer his way to do something that was clearly against the rules. Of course, I made a calm but loud enough scene for everyone to notice and eventually called Alex over again to adjudicate. Alex told him he’s full of shit and ruled in my favor.\n\nSoon enough, I had the Demonic Tutor in my hand after several turns since it was near the top. By this time, I had all that I needed but the monster. I pretended to act joyful and surprised when I threw down my Demonic Tutor and went rifling through my deck to get that monster. David’s face started to go red and his body was very agitated.\n\nThe next round, I threw that monster on the table with gusto! I celebrated with “Yes!” and “I can’t believe it!”. The other people in the room were starting to admire my skill and good luck. They were really watching my game now and clearly wanting to see me win.\n\nThe best David can do at this point is pull out a monster to block me or somehow get rid of my monster. Knowing that the only card that has a hope of achieving that is his Precious Rare safely at the bottom of his deck, I was inwardly confident, but acted nervous to lead him on that he actually had a chance of pulling one out.\n\nEvery subsequent round, I would attack him with the monster, pinging his life down. Of course, during this time, nothing good came out of his deck. Slowly, his chances for winning dwindled and his fury grew. Then it was over. I celebrated and other people in the room marveled at my amazing play style. David was so mad he was shaking. Whenever he spoke, he was petulant and angry.\n\nWhile I was making a big show of celebrating my good fortune, David had already planned and executed his next cheat. He took both his active pile and his reject pile and mixed them together as soon as the game ended. If you recall, these piles are supposed to be separate so that I could choose which pile to pilfer from. By mixing them up, he reduces the chance that I’ll randomly take any of his good cards, including his Precious Rare.\n\nI immediately called him out on it as he’s mixing them together. He starts arguing about the tournament rules and his interpretation of them. I make a big show of arguing and acting like I was cheated. Honestly, it didn’t matter that he did this since I could still see where his Precious Rare was. This final act of cheating showed his petulance and completely ruined any reputation he had in the room.\n\nI called over Alex the organizer to adjudicate and demand restitution. Clearly there was no way to unmix the decks unless you have an entropy reversal device, so the damage was done. Alex called David an asshole for what he did, and Alex tried to placate my hurt feelings.\n\nActing hurt and angry, I told him “Fine! Let’s get this over with.” David had a smirk under his face, thinking he’d finally pulled one over on me. Oh, how wrong he was.\n\nWhile making a show of concentration and trepidation, I spread his deck out and made a show of going after a card, but changing my mind a couple times. Finally, “at random”, I pulled out the card with the tiny folded corner and with drama turned it around to show everyone at the same time that it was the Precious Rare. Immediately David let out a scream of anger that made the whole room silent. He quickly packed up all his crap and stomped out of the room. But I had his Precious Rare.\n\nEveryone was overjoyed that I had completely and totally demolished David and dealt a slice of righteous karmic justice at the same time. We all agreed how much of an asshole he was and that he got what he deserved. Honestly it was the highlight of the tournament.\n\nDavid dropped out of the tournament after that and no one was sad to see him go. I never told anyone about my deception. I think people are happier thinking the universe conspired against David to deliver justice.\n\ntl;dr I outcheated the cheater by knowing the future.",

        "text": "I run a table at a friendly local game store. While not actually Adventurer's League (the official modules the company makes available), it serves the same purpose: allowing new players to dip their toes into the game and find a consistent party to meet up with. The group has evened out at eight players, so I actually encourage the occasional group split so that everyone gets the chance to shine a little and maybe grab some food or a bathroom break. I like helping out new players, and the party has fun, so it's usually a blast.\n\nYesterday it turned into a dumpster fire.\n\nThe primary players:\n\n* Grizz: Lizardfolk Rogue\n* Bevin: Aasimar Cleric\n* Skunk: Dwarf Cleric\n* Gorn: Dwarf Barbarian\n* Gerald: NPC Spectator\n\nOver the course of the first half of the session, the party had learned some important things:\n\n* Gerald the spectator was in a vault with their friend's corpse.\n* Their friend had an important McGuffin on him when a gelatinous cube ate him.\n* Gerald didn't kill their friend, and he doesn't seem all that bad for a floating abomination. A bit excitable, but not a bad guy.\n* Gerald had a friend named Steven who would calm him down by talking through some pipes when Gerald got anxious.\n\nArmed with that knowledge, four party members decided to retrieve the McGuffin from Gerald's vault. This shouldn't be hard because Gerald was an appropriate CR for the four of them, and he was no longer bound to defend that vault, so he could be reasoned with. Besides, they had a rogue and knew of a helpful NPC. Whatever path they took, they should be able to handle Gerald, and they seemed to discuss multiple possible strategies, so I wasn't worried.\n\nWhen they finally arrived at Gerald's vault, they enacted their cunning plan: push Bevin inside and let him do the talking. Bevin's player, however, was not aware that this was the plan. He had nothing prepared, and he was not a great improvisor. He went with, \"Hi.\" I tell him to roll Persuasion since I don't feel like dragging a conversation out of someone when they're clearly uncomfortable. He rolls... a natural 1. \n\nBut he has Inspiration! He can reroll!\n\nNat 2. \n\n...Whelp, it's time to start combat.\n\nThe startled Gerald immediately hits Bevin with a Confusion Ray and a Fear Ray, which seemed redundant because he was already frightened and confused. Gorn charges in to attack, and I think combat is on. Grizz also enters... and he grabs the McGuffin and runs back out the door. \n\nOkay, I guess they're going for a snatch and dash. Whatever. Let's see how that goes. Skunk is up, and he decides that he likes being on the other side of the door from Gerald. So he closes it, shutting Gorn and Bevin in the vault with Gerald. He then shouts, \"Steven!\" \n\n...I want to point out that they have never met Steven. They do not know what he looks like, they put no effort into finding him, and they have no clue what his schedule is like. Skunk was just hoping Steven happened to be nearby. He wasn't.\n\nAt this point, they have not tried a single available strategy. Instead, they have tried all of them at once, and it's not going well. Gerald took another turn, which left Gorn mildly injured and Bevin paralyzed, in addition to being confused and frightened. Gorn, meanwhile, was frustrated. He was annoyed by several instances of perceived cowardice in the rest of the party, so he walked up to the door, opened it up, and attacked Grizz, dealing more than half of Grizz's max HP in damage. \n\nGrizz freaks out because he didn't actually shut the door, grabs Bevin and retreats up a staircase. Skunk, liking the idea of retreat, dashes up behind, but Gorn - raging barbarian as he is - takes the opportunity to smack Skunk upside the head. \n\nGerald, of course, was delighted by this. That short fellow with the axe seemed alright by him, and they joined forces hunting down Skunk and beating him unconscious. Bevin, having recovered from his paralysis, but not his fear, ran away the moment he could, leaving Grizz alone. \n\nWe'll leave our friends where they are, Gorn and Gerald ransacking the vault and destroying priceless artifacts, Grizz trying and failing to stabilize Skunk with a Medicine check, and Bevin running for his life. Apparently, this is what happens when everyone comes up with a plan, and no one agrees on a plan.\n\nNo Geralds were harmed by this encounter.",

        "text": "This is an old write up i did concerning one nights attempt at flying in Cliffs of Dover, formally know as Storm of War (pre release) Full simulator mode. All that you read below is true.\n\n\n\nI climbed into the cockpit and settled my tight and perfectly rounded behind into the seat, resting my hand gently on the cold and lifeless joystick, lifeless for now, but soon to be a perfect extension of myself. I glanced sideways at the slowly dawning new day, the sun painting the lower edges of the horizon in delicate purples and mild reds. Looking ahead, i noticed traces of beer and spittle on the canopy, i reached down, grabbed my  silk scarf and wiped it clean until it appeared there was no bullet proof shielding in front of me, just the open sky and the extension of a mighty twelve cylinder Merlin, the best of British.\n\nToday...today was the day i would kill a man.\n\nMy other hand moved slowly down to the throttle, moving it slightly and feeling a nice resistance. I jostled in my seat..dammit ! The curse of such a tight butt made it hard for me to get comfortable, i blamed the way i was built, but foolishly smiled as i realised it was my strict regime of sinking a dozen pints every night and then running endlessly until i passed out through lack of food. A lock of golden wavy hair , tinged with an angry red, broke free from under my leather helmet and fell across one eye. A passing seagull winked at me.\n\nI glanced across the gauges with methodical eyes, time to get this show on the road. Magnetos on, throttle just under a third, primed the fuel pump and hit the starter..the Merlin barked and coughed, spitting flame and burnt fuel out of the exhaust on either side in front of me, the smell caused me to flare my nostrils as the propellor protestingly jerked around in small fits. Then she roared brutally into life, the plane shuddering as an yet untapped eight hundred and eighty hundred horsepower flowed through her, she burbling with a hint of that great might. A symphony of destruction as yet unleashed.\n\nAs i watched the temps slowly rise i thought of the feared Luftwaffe we were going aloft to battle. The Luftwaffe who had been destroying our coastal convoys with impunity, the Luftwaffe who had steamrolled Europe in mere weeks and smashed all air forces arrayed against it, the Luftwaffe who had the best pilots and planes in the world. I couldn't wait to get amongst them.\n\nI looked back at my wingman and flicked my wavy lock from my eyes, nodded to him and he waved pointed my hand forward in a gun and pulled the trigger, lets roll. I eased the throttle forward a notch and looking over the ladylike curves of the elliptical wing, saw the grass flattened around from my propwash, i gave the engine a quick rev, a slight touch of right brake and she turned on a dime to taxi out. \n\nOn the neat grass runway, where we often stood near our steeds and talked of air combat, our hands manoeuvring as if planes chasing each other with wide grins plastered on our unbelievably handsome faces, i trimmed for takeoff and held her on the brake, slowly brought the throttle up to half. I held her in this state a second longer, like an embrace.. she was inching forward now, desperate to break free and launch forward. My vision had narrowed to include only the confines of the cockpit, all senses attuned to what the Merlin was doing and how she felt. She was ready. I pushed the throttle all the way and released the brakes, at the same time using the rudder to counteract the torque..she leapt forward..and i was pushed back into the seat, shoulder harness tight against me, feeling as one with the machine, the whole plane trembling with power and anticipation at becoming airborne.\n\nThis would be my most graceful and important takeoff, it was what all of my flying had come down too, this one takeoff into combat this beautiful machine. If any jerry even dreamed he could shoot me down today then he'd best wake up and apologise to himself. If my flight instructor was watching, i knew he would be weak at the knees in seeing such a merging of man and machine, it was that truly that beautiful.\n\nThe tail of the Spitfire rose and i was on two wheels, level and shooting down the runway at over eighty miles  per hour..i quickly took my hand off the throttle where it was resting to once again wave my golden wavy lock away from my eyes and knocked my glass of rum all over the keyboard...WHAT THE PLONKING SHIT ?? WHAT THE CRAP WAS A KEYBOARD DOING IN MY COCKPIT AND WHY WAS RUM DRIPPING ALL OVER MY LEGS ?!?!\n\nI jumped up and slid my chair backwards into the wall, one hand still on the joystick just as my Spitfire became airborne passing ninety miles an hour, my other hand had snatched up the wet glass with an inkling of rum in the bottom, i looked at the keyboard, rum was oozing into every crevice like lava down a mountainside..i slammed the glass down in the liquid mess as my Spitfire hit a hundred and forty and watched as rum splattered across the canopy..WHAT EVEN !! I needed to get my shit together ! I needed to get my wheels up and trim for flight! I needed to wipe the fucking canopy ! I sat down and hit the rum soaked floor where my chair was moments before, dragging keyboard, joystick and throttles with me, cords leaping everywhere and rum dripping from the table that was now above me..SLAP MY GREAT AUNT!! I leapt up with a crazed look in my eye, my beautiful lock of hair askew, the throttle hanging over my shoulder, and watched as my Spitfire now doing nearly two hundred and shedding a wheel and my still lowered flaps, plummetted into the ground and fireballed across the English countryside, plowed itself into a barn and exploded, the engine seperating and ending up in a soft green summer field near a tractor. The camera panned out, now in third person, and i could hear the crackling flames as it zoomed ever higher over my failed sortie.\n\nMy wingman flew over the wreckage, his wheels softly thudding home inside the wells of his lower wing as he pushed further towards the clouds.\n\nI glanced at the carnage around me, an x52 pro joystick and throttle hotas setup scattered on the floor, lights still on. A Saitek Eclipse keyboard completely soaked in rum, also on the floor, looked again at the flames on the screen, rum all over my desk and walked towards the kitchen in rum soaked shorts to get a cloth.\n\nTomorrow..tomorrow i would kill man.

        "text": "Hi everyone! I was so happy to find this subreddit, because I loooove reading stories about gaming, whether videogames or tabletop. So I want to share with you a story I'll never forget, that caused me to buy a statue of my own character to commemorate the time I destroyed an Alliance guild and changed a server. \n\nBack in the days of Burning Crusade (the first official expansion for World of Warcraft) I was pretty heavy into PVP, the arena, and everything that entailed. I had my trusty Orc hunter with his battle hardened pet Ravager, and a bag full of fun engineering gadgets. My guild started to need more healers for raiding purposes, and since I had nothing going on in my life, I decided to start some new characters to fill that niche. \n\nI started a blood elf paladin, because blood elves were new and cool, and also an Orc Shaman. Being that this was a PVP server, sometimes you'll get an asshole high level player that will ruthlessly murder your low level characters and hound you relentlessly for God knows how long just because they're bored. So if I was getting ganked on one character, I'd switch to the other. After all, my friends and guild mates were often busy and couldn't babysit me so I could level. \n\nAs expected I would get ganked and camped all the time. Plenty of people would just crush your spirit, teabag your corpse, then move on with their lives. But I kept noticing people from one particular guild were the biggest offenders, and made it almost impossible for me to play sometimes. They liked to rule Outland (the new set of zones) with an iron fist. \n\nOf course I'd get pissed, log out of that character, grab my pvp centered (and well geared) hunter, and go stomp some filthy alliance. I could take down two or sometimes three at a time, but when that happened they would call in reinforcements and set up camp so I basically couldn't play. This became a problem because it felt like I suddenly became a target to them, as did others in the guild. If they spotted me or a guild mate, we were toast, and they'd bring as many people as they had to. \n\nAfter like a week of this nonsense, I took to the forum for the server. I called the guild out, and it turned into a flame war between horde and alliance. Threats were thrown around on both Alliance and Horde sides. Attacks across numerous guilds escalated over the following days, again targeting me or my guild mates. Many horde guilds took my side and started camping on the offending guild also. I was angry. They were angry. Something had to be done. \n\nBack to the forum I went. Harsh words were exchanged, and Zangarmarsh (the level 61-64 zone) was chosen as ground zero. We were going to war, boys! There was a PVP area in Zangarmarsh people would hang out in and fight, and at peak playtime, massive horde and alliance forces met to wage war for the zone and end the rule of the campers. \n\nHundreds of us spent hours fighting over this patch of land. Newbies would join the fight, and others would leave as needed. But one thing became clear: the fury of the horde could not be sated. The cities in Zangarmarsh were cleared out. Players couldn't quest in most places while we were duking it out, and it was glorious. Skeletons littered every inch of the zone, and at the end of the day the horde was standing after the alliance yielded. \n\nBack to the forums. Everyone honestly had a great time with this war I set in motion. We were chatting about who did what, who were the stand outs, stupid and funny things that happened, etc etc. But there was a caveat: it became an unspoken rule among the horde that the original offending guild was kill and camp on site. We took an eye for an eye, then kept taking eyes until the rest of the world was blind. \n\nThe Alliance guild effectively vanished within a few weeks. I didn't hear what happened to them, but they became super scarce to the point where they had to have hemorrhaged members due to not being able to play. I spotted a long member in a neutral city some time later, and I giggled to myself as the memories came back up. But after that, people didn't screw with me, and even Alliance members would great me by waving/bowing/whatever when they saw me out and about. \n\nI later heard rumors that most of that guild transfered to another server, but I can't confirm that actually happened.",

        "text": "Some years ago I found myself happily addicted to the Guitar Hero and Rock Band games. My favourite was Beatles Rock Band, as I really like the Beatles, and I was getting pretty good at it. Playing on the highest level (using all 5 buttons on the guitar) was like playing together with the Beatles for real. Add to that the great visuals in that game (which beat Guitar Hero's boring \"Here's your character on a stage\" stuff by a landslide), and you can see why I was hooked.\n\nI was also a massive stoner, and my favourite thing in the world back then was to roll a fat spliff then start playing Beatles Rock Band for hours on end, and even after the gazillionth time doing that thing where you look around the room and everything moves inward because your eyes have been focused on that guitarneck going into infinity for so long the movement is kinda burned into your retinas.\n\nSo one night I had playing and smoking for a long time. My song had ended and I was looking through the list of songs to see which I would pick next, when all of a sudden I noticed a song I'd never seen before: \"I want you (She's so heavy)\". This was also a Beatles song I wasn't familiar with. Needless to say I was intrigued, and very happy to be able to have a new song after 5-starring all that shit multiple times (Rock Band is a bit easier than Guitar Hero, but also to be honest I was pretty fucking good at it). I loaded up the song and started playing along.\n\nSo I play and the song was fun and all was good, I keep playing and playing, and at some point I think \"man, this song is pretty long...\" Of course I played on, and on, and on, and... I don't know if you know this, but weed kinda slows down time, everything seems to take longer... so what is already a pretty long track (especially by Beatles standards) seemed even longer to my stoned-as-fuck self. Then I noticed that the song also seemed to repeat itself, and had been for some time. \"Hmmm...\", I thought. \"Is this game in a loop or something? Meh, whatever\" - kept playing. Still didn't stop. I started to get a bit suspicious, but I didn't want to ruin my score so kept playing.\n\nThen I started noticing something... it seemed as if there was a slight noise, like white noise or something, underneath the music. Strange. Whatever, keep playing. The noise grew and grew, slowly but surely, and then I noticed that the screen seemed to get similarly noisy... I tried my best to ignore it, play it off as my stoned mind playing tricks on me or something, but the noise kept increasing, the song kept repeating, and at some point I couldn't really pretend it wasn't there anymore. I started freaking out a bit. Like... what was happening here? Is this game broken? Am I stuck in some kind of weird loop? Where did this song come from? Why had I never seen it before? More noise, more repetition, more paranoia creeping in, feeling really weirded out now, what the fuck is this - but kept playing because hey, what else are you going to do? And the noise keeps building, and building, and building, the song keeps repeating, repeating, repeating, I keep playing, playing, playing, freaking out, freaking out, freaking out until...\n\nCHOP.\n\nThe song ended abruptly, without warning, the screen went black. I was dumbfounded, questioning my sanity, talking to myself out loud at this point.\n\nThe game went back to the menu, and I decided it was high time (ha!) to go to bed because this was too fucking much.\n\nThe next morning I got up, and a bit apprehensively I started up the game again. I scrolled through the list and sure enough, there it was, \"I want you (She's so heavy)\". Started the song, played it through, same shit happened as the night before. I went online and looked up the song, and sure enough, the official recording was exactly the same! I laughed so hard, both at my idiotic paranoid stoner self, as well as the fact that when the Beatles recorded that song they probably knew goddamn well what they were doing, freaking out little stoners with this weird trick.\n\nI later ended up selling my entire Guitar Hero/Rock Band collection to a 15 year old girl who'd been scammed on Marktplaats (Dutch E-bay), and I really wanted her to have it and enjoy it as much as I did, but I still miss that game. I'd love to do another all-nighter playing Beatles Rock Band high as a fucking kite.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nedit: here's the song for your reference and listening pleasure: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-h-UWvGXlyU",

        "text": "#Here's a story about how Lego Island stole my innocence.\n\nI remember getting our first Windows 95 computer. Turning it on for the first time Christmas morning, finding that Santa wrote me a scrolling text screensaver message with my name on it, and had installed Lego island for me. My level of flabbergast was at maximum safe levels.\n\nI think Windows 95 may be the single most nostalgic thing for me personally, the 3D rat maze screensaver, the hovercraft capture the flag game, [that gorgeous startup sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHa7ZC6Z0), but that's a story for another time. Windows 95 was our first computer and because of that, we weren't knowledgeable about certain features of the software, such as clicking and dragging. This is important. I must have been six or seven years old at the time.\n\nYou need to click and drag your chosen character to the location on the map you want to start into actually leave the info tower and play. Because of not really understanding how to actually start the game, I spent most of the first week of owning it just exploring the Info Tower. I thought the Info Tower WAS Lego Island. The Infomaniac was my first video game friend. When I DID figure out how to leave the Info Tower, it was like leaving the Imperial Sewers for the first time in Oblivion. The whole world opened up. The island is really no bigger than a small suburban block, but it felt like an entire planet. I explored every inch of that world, from the store that was always mysteriously closed, to the pirate in the cave who would give you hints. The one place in the game I didn't like to go was the prison island. The Brickster was literally the scariest thing I'd ever seen in my life. It was the first time that a cartoon villain would talk to me directly. Hell, his head even tracked where I was and followed me as I walked around. Because of this, I really didn't like doing the pizza delivery missions very often. I spent most of my time racing and exploring.\n\nFor those of you who don't know, the \"main plot\" of the game doesn't trigger until a certain set of circumstances are met. One; you need to be playing as Pepper, and two; you need to have built a helicopter, and three; you need to deliver a pizza to the Brickster. Every time I played, I made a new save file and never really stuck with one. Mostly because I liked entering new names and not really understanding that my progress was saved, so sometimes I had a helicopter, and sometimes I didn't. Couple that with the fact that I hated delivering pizzas to the Brickster, and that I almost always played as Nick, it was **months** before I knew that there was a main mission to play. Lego Island was legitimately a safe place for me. I was a **very** sensitive kid, and easily frightened.\n\nOn one fateful day, the stars lined up. I chose Pepper, built a helicopter, and started the pizza delivery mission. It was supposed to go the usual way. I bring the pizza to Brickster, he doesn't like it and throws it away, and I get a red brick reward for getting there fast enough. That didn't happen. I watched as he slid open the bars to his cell and walked out. This was on par with some of the gaming creepypastas that you see from time to time. Just like how Link isn't supposed to frequently be electrocuted in the Ben Drowned creepypasta, the Brickster is **NOT** supposed to be outside of his jail, ever. I was legit having a mild panic moment. As he stole the helicopter and started taking apart the city, the other characters surrounded me and demanded to know if I was responsible for letting him go free. I felt like crying, I felt like turning off the game. My safe world was supposed to always be happy and friendly was being stolen from me. You have to remember that I was six, I really didn't understand how video games worked. I simply assumed that my game was gone forever if I didn't stop him.\n\nI was sent on a quest to find the pieces of the helicopter, and eventually try to catch him before he took apart the whole city. I failed, and was greeted to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNSDo__LPQU). I absolutely thought my game was gone forever. I thought my parents were going to yell at me for ruining the game Santa gave to me.\n\nThis game fucking ended my childhood.\n\nEdit: Holy shit, this is the top post of all time on /r/gametales . You guys are awesome!\n\nEdit 2: It's amazing how much my story resonated with so many people. Love responding to your comments and talking about this shit. I should point out that I'm being playfully overdramatic here. It didn't really destroy my childhood or anything :p",

        "text": "Does \"the pirates of the fantasy version of the Caribbean, searching for something like the cursed brother of the One Piece\" sounds appealing? Yes? Then, me lads and lasses, I've got a treat for you.\nThis is a documentation of the weird, quirky, strange and funny adventures of my group and myself. We play a homebrewed game (I'll explain the rules when necessary). We started a brand-new campaign that promises a lot of fun, action and feels and so I decided to write it all down.\nOne reason is that I loved reading steelshod, the other is so that we can look back once we're done.  And can enjoy the way we've come.\n\nThe setting is a simple (and weird) fantasy version of the Caribbean. Except, that it's located in the black sea. And that this sea is f*cking huge. It's a seafarer campaign with a focus on exploration, adventure and character development. And our goal is nothing else then Avalon... I mean Askard itself - the legendary isle of apples where the gentry of the fairy folk helped the population to build the greatest magical civilisation the world ever saw.\nBut on the way there is enough space for sea-witches, water elementals in the head of engineers, mutant mana monsters, pirate monkeys and sooo much more.\nInterested? Then all hands on deck!\nThis is about to get... beefy.\n\nBecause our first character is exactly this; beef. Or to put it more adequately, he is a bullling. Bulllings are one of many races in the word of Due'Garthan (old elvish for \"the garden\"). A Bullling is something like a small minotaur, but more human. His name is Kiras and he is the grand grandson of a sailor that wrote a logbook with 10 clues on how to find the lost city-isle of Askard. He is a sailor, a great navigator and knows what to shout when the battle is raging. He wants to become rich so that he can buy the freedom of his village that is under control of some pirates (imagine Nami’s backstory from One Piece). He seeks the treasure of “incredible wealth” his grand grandfather wrote about. He fights with two Axes and is a devout believer. Which god he prays to, do you ask? To the whispers of the witchwood-forest on his home island. A goddess of nature lives there, calling herself the “whisperess” and she’s someone we’ll meet soon enough.\nHis defining characteristics are his impressive agility and his weird habit to talk of himself as Kiras, instead referring to himself as “I”.\n\nOur next brave adventurer is no one else than the knowledgeable human Atticus, an engineer and golemancer. He is from the southern Somer-Imperium (Byzanz). Born with the powerful blood of the swartalfs in his veins he is an enchanter, one of very few in the world that can create a true artefact which magic will endure the tests of time. With him is his journeyman’s piece, Izabelle. She is an magical construct (imagine a dwemer spider from skyrim). His goal is to find knowledge to improve Izi from a lifeless automaton to an almost living being. He wants her to be his masterpiece.\nHe is incredible intelligent and a master in engineering, mathematics and golemancy. Yet he is frail and no combatant at all.\n\nAlright, we got a cow and a scientist, what’s next? A giant, female, one-armed, Spanish/Japanese Warrior from hell!\nMeet Roina. She comes from one of the many isles in the blue sea (the name of the oceans on Garthen are all colours) that is located in the territorial waters of  País (Spain). She lost her left arm in an ambush and carries a mysterious idunese (japanese) sword, engraved with strange symbols and encrusted with a broken ruby.\nShe will have to remain a mystery for now, because her backstory and the plot are a little… intertwined.\nShe fights with a katana and talks of herself as “us” and “we” instead of “I”. She is incredibly strong and enduring and with one arm as strong as normal men with two.\n\nLast but not least: the brothers bear. No wait. Wrong one. Do you know these best buddies that always play brothers in game? Well, that’s them.\nLogan and Quincy are the sons of the sea witch Calypso. Quincy was born blind and learned Kung Fu from one of the many war refugees from Xing (China). He is also an born mage, a rare and wondrous trait, especially on the sea. He is a good looking, but rugged chap with a tick for cleanliness and someone who is really infuriated by the bolts and gears that are left behind when Atticus was on deck.\nLogan on the other hand is the hardest, chain-smoking son-of-a-bitch that has ever scrubbed a counter. He is tall (yet not as tall as Roina, that towers with 2,12m/7ft over the rest of the crew).\nHe is pretty tough, brutish and mindful alike. He is strong in flesh and will and prefers heavy blunt weapons over girl Never to be seen without a dried leaf full of burning tobacco, he is the innkeeper of the “Lahndgank”.\n\nAnd, oh boy, let me tell you about the Lahndgank.\nYou’ll see, we’re Germans (sorry for my English btw, hope it’s readable). And the word “Landgang” means as much as “shore leave”.\nSo here’s the deal; Logan and Quincy have a boat, a cog, on which they’ve build a bar. This tavern-ship bears the name “shore leave” or “Landgang”. This is because the use the boat to navigate to bigger ships on the sea and sell their grog to the sailors. As you see, they are something like a shore leave for the boys. But then, why Lahndgank and not “Landgang”? Well… 6G (my very own homebrewed system) lists the skill “Read &amp; Write”. As long as this skill is at least on Level 1, you can read and write. Higher levels represent a deeper understanding about poesy, literature and stuff like that. And neither Quincy nor Logan have a level of Read &amp; Write. So… yeah. They pretty much paid an orphan to write the word on a plank. That’s that.\n\nOkay, now… oh. Oh! Are we ready?! YES we are, laddies.\nHold on to your grog, it’s gonna be a bumpy ride.\n\n  Charpter One – How we got our asses cursed  \n\n\nOr story begins on the Lahndgank. It’s the first cosy night of the year and many sailors of Port Ica (imagine Tortuga) are at the docs to have a drink.\nYou see, under normal circumstances I really hate the “y’all meet in a bar” start to a campaign. But this time it was different. I mean; hey! This time two of my players owned the friggin place! So how could I have resisted?\nLogan scrubs the counter and sells overpriced grog to drunken dockers. Quincy navigates trough the stuffed bar and serves food and spiced wine. He may be blind, but he memorized the tables and walks sure. Also he is able to use “sixth sense” a talent that allows him to notice what no other sense could. Talents like this are purchasable at character creation.\nAnd how the GM… I mean chance would have it; Atticus, Roina and Kiras are all at this very evening in Port Ica. And all of them heard that the lads on the Lahndgank serve some damn good grog.\nSo the PC’s meet for the first time. The usual stuff happens; some awkward roleplay because everyone tries to befriend random people and some backstoy is revealed.\nThen it happens. I start to tell them, that they hear some calls from the doc. Many sailors pay their meals and grog and leave as fast as they can. Suddenly, the Lahndgank is half empty.\nThen, a paladin, a rouge, a elven ranger, a bard and a wizard step on the gangplank. They’re pretty drunk and yell pretty loud.  \nIn 6G there are no classes. You’re not an fighter. You’re not defined by you combat abilities; it’s a point-buy-system where you can build the character you like. So what was going on was, that I wanted to make a joke about adventurer groups that cleared a dungeon and came to town to make party.\nBut this time, my players where on the receiving end. It almost escalated, but one of the more eloquent players de-escalated the situation and for a while everyone drank and sung.\nBut suddenly the wizard of the adventurer group, Tennek, started acting weird. First he started to mumble gibberish, then fire started to emerge from his hands.\nQuincy, a mage may I remind you, came to the brilliant conclusion, that something was wrong and tried to blast that crazy dude from the ship. A quick explanation of magic; there are five schools; Summoning, Transformation, Mind, Mysticism and Manipulation. If you want to cast a spell, then you’ll have to state what effect it shall have (no premade Spells). The GM thinks about it and tells you what dice you’ll have to use. The higher the dice, the harder the skill check. Then you’ll throw the dice. Your goal is to have roll a result that is as low as possible, but at least equal or lower than your skillrating.\nQuincy didn’t roll equal or lower. And if you fail a spell… then the best part of my day begins. I get to roll up an spellfail. And boy, spellfails make my day. Long story short; he ended up blasting his own consciousness out of his body without realising it. He instead assumed that he had catapulted himself forwards. Laughing he decided to tackle the wizard. So he rammed into him, kicking him out of his body as well.\nBefore anyone else could react, the wizard, now controlled by something else, blasted into flames, horns sprouting from his forehead and blazing eyes searching for something far, far away.\n“I am Hellebrandt.” he called. “Prince of the inferno. You, my child, go searching for the jewel of Askard. Find you cousin.”  \nThen he burned a symbol in the planks and fell to the ground, his horns shattering like porcelain.\nRoina decided to take him and throw him overboard.\nBut when they pulled him back up, one of his companions came to their aid. The elvish ranger. She introduced herself as Gleli and started crying as she saw the broken and screaming body of her mentor. So she decided to release him and stabbed him in the heart.  \nNow most of the guests of the Lahndgank fled.\nThe characters and the NPC’s came together to talk.\nThe NPC’s introduced themselves. Next to Glevi were also Khurir, the paladin, Gin, a young woman that just stood about 140cm high, but was a mad adrenaline junkie and a rouge moreover, Na’il the bard and last, but not least, Eawhee a “polynesian” healer and her dog aloha.\nWait, you might say. Who is this now? Yeah, well. Eawhee was the character my gf played in the first session. Initially I thought that she would not play with that group (she didn’t) but the players loved her character so much, that she was included as an NPC in their crew.  \nBack to the story.\nThey talked.\nTurns out, that Atticus had a semester about arcane lore. Remember how spells work? Skillchecks are pretty much the same. The GM gives you a difficulty (1, 2, 3, 4or 5, representing the d4, d6, d8, d10 and d12) and you try to get equal or lower to your skill. Easy. Yet he fails, but surprisingly it's Roina that tells the group, that the symbol that was burnt in the ground is one of the 13 glyphs of the infernal alphabet. To be more precisely; it is a symbol with the meanings like task, quest or work. So they talk and come to the conclusion that they need to do this task, because they have no idea what that rune will do to them if they just try to wander of.\nProblem: they don’t know where Askard is. You see, the mist in these seas is no ordinary mist. It’s magical. Islands can lie directly in front of you, and you could miss them. Sometimes these islands are stuck in time, simply weird, have strange conditions or are of an untypical biome. So what you need is a map. With a map you can find the island you’re searching for. But… no one knows where Askard is. Imagine Atlantis. Maybe it’s sunken, maybe the island has shattered into smaller islands, maybe it’s something else. So where do you get a map that leads you to the island no one knows how to get to? Well, you may know think; Kiras has the logbook. He knows!\nExactly. But there is another problem. Kiras decides to keep his trap shut. Because he fears that he’ll be double-crossed. It’s roleplay, and we others thought that if this is what he wants to do, then it’s his good right.\nSo what to do? Logan says, that his mother surely knows what to do. So the group sets sail to the island of Calypso.\n\nNow there is one thing that deserves a little explanation. What happened to Quincy and Tennek? As you’ll probably remember, Quincy (the blind monk) accidentally blasted his own consciousness out of his body and kicked then Tenneks mind out of his shell, too.\nSo what happened to them and why did nobody notice that Quincy wasn’t in his body anymore? After he blasted himself and Tennek into the veil (the plane between our world and the spirit world) they needed a few minutes to adjust themselves. Then they realised, that they were in the veil. So far so well, but what to do now? Tennek tells Qunicy, that they have 8 ours top to get back into the physical realm, or there done for.\nWell shit…\nAs you remember, Tenneks body was burned and stabbed because Glevi thought that it was the better option than to let him live as a cripple. So they need to find a way to save Tennek. But first they need to tell the others, because they remember, that Atticus said, that he was an enchanter. And an enchanter can bin spirits to gemstones. This could save Tennek. So all Quincy has to do is getting back into his body and then finding a gemstone that can house Tenneks mind. But this is the point where things get crowded.\nBecause Quincys body is empty no more; a spirit saw his chance and overtook it. Many higher spirits long to be free from their unearthly tether and roam the world of mortal men for their own amusement.\nCalendith is one of this spirits. Qunicy walks up to himself and asks if he could have his body back. Calendith says no. Well shit. This is the situation; while they’re talking, they realise that Calendith is a nice guy (for a spirit). He doesn’t want to be the reason that Tennek and Quincy fade away (which equals death in the spirit world). But he also doesn’t want to go back. So they have one body, but three minds that need one. But to bring Calendith to cooperating with them, Quincy has to make a deal with him; Calendith will leave his body (if necessary) but he’ll point out a new body, if he takes a liking in one. He’ll ask three times for a certain person. Quincy has then to help him steal that body or he can refuse this plead 2 times. If he were to refuse it a third time, then Calendith will reclaim Quincys body for good and watch his soul fade away.\nAfter making the deal, they decide to ask Atticus for help. He is confused at first, but understands the horrifying problem as Calendith in Quincys body demonstrates his abilities. They start to brainstorm, but the only thing they can come up with is to bind Calendith to an gemstone, so that Tennek and Quincy can share Quincys body. They find a gemstone (Na’il, the bard, found a small diamond on his last adventure), but it’s way too small to house Calendith. So Quincy asks if they could bind Calendith to Tenneks dead body instead. The spirit isn’t really fond of this idea, but he accepts. Turns out, that nobody on the ship knows ratshit about necromancy. So back to the drawing board. They decide to bind Qunicy and Tennek to the diamond, because they lack better options and are running out of time.  \n  \nThe group sails to the island of the sea-witch to ask for her council.\nAs they met her, they see an incredible beauty, no older than sixteen, but when she speaks she sounds like an old washerwomen. Scary.\nThey ask her for help and she deals with their shit after they needed almost half an hour to convince her.\nFirst she puts Calendith into a voodoo puppet (he is not thrilled about it, but hey, better than going back into the spirit world).\nThen she puts Quincy and Tennek into Quincys body, but puts Tennek to sleep.\nLastly she gives Logan a puppet that always points into the direction of the isle where she knew a sailor that told everybody that he found Askard.\nYeah, you guessed it; it’s the island where Kiras comes from.\nThe group gets back on deck and wants to sail to that island to find the logbook, but then Kiras steps up and tells them, that he has it. They were not pretty happy when they found out, that he had it all along, but it’s better than nothing.\nThe first clue to find the legendary island is; “On the isle of the monkey king, follow the kings gaze.”\nNice. But where is that island?\nKiras rolls for seafaring and remembers that in Port Ica (the place where they came from) is the great nautical archive. In there has to be a map to the monkey island!\n\nAnd this concludes our first session!\nIf you wanna find out how they became pirates, stole some really expensive painting, killed a man with nothing but an exploding barrel and became known as the vile poisoners of Port Ica – all of this by accident! – then you’ll want to read “Chapter 2 – The great snail”.  \nI’ll hope you had a fun read. If this post is weird or my style is questionable; this is my very fist post. If you have suggestions or constructible criticism, I’d be glad to hear it!\n\nChapter 2 - The great snail is out!

        "text": "So I was playing Heroquest; a late 80s board game that is a pretty much a very dumb'd down version of DnD. Great if you don't care to actually role play. Basically a dungeon is set up, and the 80's era Barbarian, Wizard, Elf, or Dwarf would explore the dungeon, fighting Goblins, Orcs, Gargoyles, Mummies, ext while a Dungeon Master sets each room/hallway up as you explore them with monsters or random objects like dressers, torture tables, chests.\n\nWhen you play you can search a room for treasure/traps/hidden doors; but only once per turn. \n\nWe were playing a homebrewed expansion her family created over the years, with new characters and everything. \n\nEnter, Rorc; a Rogue Orc. A character that's almost as strong as the barbarian but will not agro most monsters upon entering a room, and can convince a d4's worth of Orcs to fight with the group. The convinced orcs can't do **anything** but fight. No searching for treasure, no opening doors, no activating traps.\n\nAfter clearing a room of goblins, Rorc convinces another Orc to join his team.\n\n\"HAHAHA, RORC MIGHTIEST OF ADVENTURERS!! NONE AS SMART AS RORC!!\"\n\n(Rorc takes the opportunity to search for traps and the DM tells him there is one in the dresser)\n\n\"ORC! You live in room, are there traps here that could hurt Rorc!!\"\n\nThe orc then points at the very obvious crossbow hanging from the ceiling pointing at the dresser.\n\nRorc pauses at the ridiculousness of this trap.\n\n\"Of course I knew about *that* trap...Rorc not dumb! ORC! Activate the trap!\"\n\nRorc is reminded that the Orc cannot. It can just move and fight.\n\n\"Very well...ORC! Walk into the dresser!!\"\n\nRorc is reminded Orcs can't open doors\n\n\"HOW YOU CANT OPEN DOOR? Rorc orc, and can open doors!\"\n\nThe Orc gets confused, looks at closet, back at Rorc, &amp; makes a stabby motion with his dagger.\n\n\"NO YOU DUMB DUMB!!! LIKE THIS!!\"\n\nRorc arrogantly walks over to the dresser, and flings the closet open. \n\n(The DM) Rorc stands there, confident in his intelligence over the Orc underling. The Orc looks surprised at Rorc, as Rorc gazes down at his chest, he remembers the door was trapped as he notices an arrow sticking out of his armor.\"\n\n\"Rorc knew that would happen!!! Rorc just wanted to show Orc how dumb Orc is...\"\n\nRorc went on to have many adventures and gathered many a tale with his wizard companion Emanuel Phillipe Nerdstrom the third, otherwise known as \"RORCS adventures with NERD!!!!!!!\"",

the rest of the party doesn't know this at this point in the game.... \n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nWe left off having blown up 2 of Tesla's towers, with a 3rd one about a day's travel away, we set out, Salad napping on the back of the Gigantosaurus (Giga) while The inquisitor rides Fluffly Kzar rides his mammoth and so on.... we pass through some deep swamps and the mammoth gets bogged down a bit before  Fluffy lifts him out and carries him to the far side.... only to get everyone involved (kzar the mammoth, the inquisitor and fluffy) caught in this truly enourmous spider web... blehh... \n\nWhile everyone tries and fails to free themselves, a huge size spider begins crawling towards them... this was the effects of the 1st tower we didnt stick around long enough to see Fluffy's discomfort and concern at this creature wakes Salad (Permanent telepathic bond) thing is apparently the web was about head height for the Giga, so while the Paladin and elemental work to free the rest of the party, Salad directs the Giga to first chomp on the spider, then to swallow it hole the next round, killing it... the DM looked a bit crestfallen at that and I reminded him the Giga was not my fault at alll- he gave me that, He wearily agrees and we move on towards the 3rd tower\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nBreaching the 3rd tower went much like the first two, albiet with increased security, Salad and the elemental entered, while the rest of the group attacked the ground forces, Salad was forced to use more spells this round as there was a strong contingent of guards around the machine this time....however we succeeded and Salad began to wreck the machine, the elemental however decided to follow the machine's workings downwards, following along to a massive network of cables that could only lead into the citadel.\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe tower blows, this time summoning creatures from all kinds of planes to fight each other and everything else (like in China) we bemoan the loss and the stupidity of the elemental... the Paladin and Inquisitor both swear to ensure the receive their Canadian citizenship and as many medals as deserved posthumously (apparently thats why the elemental joined up in the first place, to fast track their immigration process) Salad kinda shrugs and is disappointed the elemental is gone but there are bigger issues to deal with.. you know like the Robo Lich that is gonna cause the end of the world?\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMoving towards the 4th tower we eventually come across a wide open glade, a feeling of foreboding fills us as we stare at the massive tree in the center of the glade, some detecting magic and evil, some reading of Salad's books determines its a Gnarlwood- a Treant that was planted in Unhallowed ground, and is extremely evil, it also exudes Evocation magic (important in a moment)\nThe party decides do engage the creature, the paladin coming forth to speak to it, Salad getting ready to... well you will see, YOU WILL ALL SEE!! \nThe gnarlwood shakes its branches and all sort of skeletons fall from the branches, animating and surging forth to attack us, The inquisitor sets up his double hackbutt and repeatedly missed a skeletal squirrel, it almost reached him before he finally hit.\n\nagainst the Gnarlwood, the Giga charged and chomped the gnarlwood, grappling it, instead of eating it though he merely held it and Salad directed everyone to stand back as he began the Arcane Ritual learned from the Black knight.\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nNow the ritual takes a long time to cast (rounds equal to your caster level) you must be touching them the whole time, and requires a will save at the end... \nThe party watches as the Gnarlwood begins first to glow softly then fade from existence and salad glows brighter and brighter, veins bulging as he nearly bursts from magical power- however the will save is passed and the Evocation power is his, reaching towards the 4th tower Salad wipes his hand across it as if wiping chalk from a chalkboard and the tower is erased from existence... He then falls unconcious.\n\nMechanically its pretty much save or die, needing a very high roll to pass the will save (approx 20% success change) with the power/failure being tied to the type of magic used by the creature, a second will save can be used to try and change the magic power to a different one.. Now the failure of the Evocation power is \"catastrophic failure of the spellcaster\" not spell, spellcaster... so yeah bad stuff... The good however- for Evocation its get the use of a single greater miracle- now I went to look up greater miracle it turns out there isnt a spell called greater miracle- miracle is a 9th level spell and does some ridiculous things (like plane shifting a whole army with no failure chance) I asked the GM and he told me to take the spell miracle and \"make it greater\" soooo fun times! Similarly Necromancy can be used to become a strong nearly indestructable undead, but failure turns you CE and almost mindless- with only the desire to kill all life, keeping all your spells and abilities intact and control over all the same minions, raising more whenever possible- scary stuff!\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSalad awakes in the guest room of Kalden's (Inquisitor) Tent-mansion with the inquisitor asking what the hell was that, Salad retorts that we all have our secrets, gesturing as best he can around the room, To which Kalden freaks out with A TENT IS A LOT DIFFERENT THAN HARNESSING GOD POWERS\n\nSalad just mentions that He paid close attention to the Black Knight's ritual and worked it out, but stressed how dangerous it was, Kalden wanted him to teach him but Salad refused- he also wanted Salad to write it down so he could give a copy to Captain Canuck, Salad also refused on the grounds if we wrote it down and Tesla beat us then he'd be even more powerful and unstoppable- lets not let that happen (also Why would Salad give his power over so willingly to people who at best have been meh about his necromancy, at worst he gets the stink eye for it and oblique comments about \"if this was on Canadian soil...\" )\n\nSalad is released and we rest for the evening, before setting out towards the Citadel of Nikola Tesla\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe elemental followed the power cables to the energy core of Nikola Tesla and began trying to wreck it unfortunately Tesla was able to stop him for the most part but not before damage was done. The rest of the part arrives and Tesla tells us about defeating the elemental and how we are all fools who will never stop him and blah blah typical evil villain stuff....\nThe Giga smashes the door down but is too large to fit inside, Salad uses carry companion to shrink him down, Fluffy however fits, so do the Skeletal apes so Salad and his menagerie enter the hall following the party. As we travel we determine a few things, 1) being that this was not really designed as a fortress or for human in habitation, its a horrendous mess of ups, downs, lefts, bizzaro twists, sloped corridors. We find ever larger workshops (both larger in the more expansive and larger in that the user was larger) filled first with defunct spybots then more and more advanced creations including the constructs we fought at the towers, then more complicated things, constructs with double jointed arms, better joints, crossbows built in... this leads us to believe scary stuff is ahead..... boy were we right.\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nWe enter into a grand hall, all dark, however darkvision is most definitely a think so we see spider like constructs clinging to the ceiling then dropping down to fight us. Salad flings up a wall of fire between us and them, they stride through it as if It was nothing, shooting bolts at Salad and bringing him to half health, hurting the Inquistor, but failing to especially harm the Paladin, Fluffy roars and chomps on one, Sir Micheal the Paladin duels a pair of them as the monkeys go wild and attack the constructs, wildly failing the rolls and flailing everywhere (in acutal seriousness I rolled about 8 3's in a row that session except for will saves) a set of them even knocking over a construct and nearly hitting Sir Micheal who dodged out of the way.  Kalden The inquisitor was the star of this combat with his double hackbutt mowing down constructs left and right, another pair of bolts hit Salad bringing him to 1 hp remaining, before Fluffy tears a construct apart as Kalden blasts the head off the last one.\nusing their Captain Canuck granted Divine powers Both Sir Micheal and Kalden heal Salad to full health, that was a rough one, but we made it. and at the end of the hall was a gargantuan door, all ornate and whanot- clearly the boss door, So we made sure we were ready to go and we went through it... Immediately after we entered I got to shout I told you so. \n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSo there we are, face to face with the Gargantuan robo-form of robo-lich Nikola Tesla, He rants a bit about progress and how we are ruining things but no matter we cant stop him.... blah blah evil villain monolouge, ham handed philosophy, blah blah, we point out that all he's doing is setting up himself as ruler of the world and etc. He claims to be doing nothing more than making life better for people (oh Zealots)  I set my skeletal monkeys to trashing as much of the machinery as they can get to. and the rest of us fan out/charge Tesla, I hit him and the machinery with a couple chain lightnings and flung fireballs around but by and large Salad didnt do a ton, Neither did Fluffy other than engaging and keeping the pressure on Tesla for Kalden and Sir Micheal to hammer him with shot after shot and attack, but Tesla wasnt a weakling he knocked Micheal against a wall, hit Fluffy for a heavy cannon shot wounding him heavily, leaving Kalden and Salad standing there going uh oh.... Salad found his weak spot (the back of his neck) and directed Kalden to take a shot there, and boom Tesla goes down crashing into the ground. Speedily the Spider-legged brain form of Tesla extricates itself from the suit dodging Salad's web attempt to stop him, smashing into the control panel and scrabbling to turn it one, He laughs at us via telepathy, he's won, the magic shall be drained and we will be nothing to stop him, mwahahaha. Kalden and Sir Micheal want to kill him but Salad stops them,the Machine begins to whirr, the ceiling doors open a path to the clear skies above the lost world. Sir Micheal grabs the Giga statue (carry companion) and flings it in the way hoping the mass of the Giga can stop it, The resulting beam blasts through the Giga rendering it to pieces. Down below Kalden flung manacles on Tesla and Salad began the ritual again, Tesla radiates all the schools of magic, an enormous amount of power availible,,\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nFar above us the magical energies hit the outer edges of our atmosphere but instead of dissipating they burst and tear and we can feel the cold of the void beyond, then looking up we see a figure that is immense beyond possibility, with a many tentacled face and arms that are beyond colossal it begins reaching down, first crushing the power core Tesla had built, spitting the elemental out and tearing it from the ground.\nIts now that Salad finishes the ritual and makes the will save, the only 20 I rolled that entire session couldnt have come at a more opportune time, as I *barely* make the will save (needed almost an 18, it gets harder depending on what Im trying to drain) because I rolled a 20 I got to pick 2 of the schools to use, first I chose Evocation, and Salad glowing even brighter than with the Gnarlwood reaches one arm to the sky hand stretched out wide, and an immense hand of golden light reaches forth up towards the void, and with a gesture Salad closes the void, Severing the arm of the monster beyond.... \n\nAs the glow fades from Salad, his skin stretches taught, his organs wither...  Salad is no longer a mere Necromancer, he has become a powerful undead. The brain of Tesla fades from existence and Salad is left standing alone with his companions. Regarding them all, and in a voice weighed by many years, by suffering and death beyond counting, The voice of Death itself speaks \n\n\"It is done\"\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSo that is the current end of the tale of Salad the Necromancer, and the major campaign as a whole, we will be coming back to these characters from time to time in the form of smaller serial adventures, that sort of thing, but by and large this is the end. so I figured Id do end of campaign Character Bios:\n\nPaladin Sir Micheal -Shining Angel of Justice: The Dragon gate gifted Sir Micheal with the ability to see what is just and right when he removes his blindfold, He has been wearing the Valkyrie's eidolon so long its almost a part of him, he bears a striking figure, glowing bright as day with 4 wings, glittering armor and a flaming sword. His zeal in pursuing what is right has not been lessened one bit, it has been tempered with pragmatism and he has begrudgingly accepted that *maybe* undead have some few uses in the world. He still gets the majority of his powers from Captain Canuck and retains his rant within the RCMP, Knows how to say \"you are under arrest in even more languages now\n\nFalcata -Elemental Master Chef: As we traveled Falcata gained more mastery over both his ability to change shape and his mastery of the fine art of gourmet cooking. within Baba Yaga's hutt he was able to claim a magical cook pot that has been transcribed with his cooking knowledge (as well as follows him around) a being able to shift from earth, to fire, water, air, or even pure positive energy is a rarity, possibly even unique, so he will likely want to stay out of the eye of those who would want to experiment on him.\n\nInquisitor Kalden Derova -Interrogator Imperatus and Sharpshooter Extraordinaire: Kalden kept in mind one of the main goals of the RCMP internal affairs, keep the other members in line, which he definitely did with Sir Micheal, ensuring that together they never strayed far from the path of law and justice, good and evil however are far more subjective to Kalden, what matters is that the law is upheld. He proved to be a crack shot, except for that time with the undead squirrel, and extremely good at finding out information people wanted to keep hidden. Enjoyed living in his fancy mansion tent for a long time while everyone else slept in their little camp tents unknowing that all the comforts one could want were mere steps away.\n\nThe Valkyrie - champion of the Norse gods and Summoner of beast from beyond: well for starters the player decided it was funny when I mentioned I didnt know their character's name, and they have refused to tell me since then.... The Valkyrie has focused more on their magical might recently, bequeathing their Eidolon onto Sir Micheal and taking up the bow, and other more esoteric means of attack such as summoning celestial gorillas or using their vambraces that shoot rocks at the enemy, Always an upbeat personality, and seeking to take in the sights of the world around her, the Valkyrie proved to be a strong companion, bestowing many boons upon those that fought alongside her, and maintaining a friendly demeanor, even with those that otherwise would be shunned.\n\nand lastly Zelac Blackstar- Salad the \"lich\" and Master of Dark Magic: While he is not entirely a lich he is still a powerful form of undead, blessed with incredible regeneration and resistances. Salad has grown vastly in power since he joined the party to stop magic from being drained out of the world, going from a fireball being the mightiest of his effects to using powers like Chain lightning or Circle of death, learning how to drain the essence of other creatures to perform feats of magical might beyond what should be possibly, but there is a cost, only Salad truly understands how hard it was to close the void, how close he was to failing and the Creature from the Void being loosed on the world. He seeks more power, to prepare the world for what surely will be coming back. He must become an avatar of death, one willing to sacrifice anyone, for if he should fail, then everyone will be consumed....\n\n",

        "text": "This story takes place in the others I have written. As a DnD group your past exploits are noted and saved in the world. If you became a war tyrant you stay one and your character can be fought later on and so on. \n\nAlso, if one of your past characters from years ago is being met or interacted with by a new group of people you may have never met the DM must call you and give you an opportunity to play your own character.\n\nThis story is of my paladin that is responsible for changing the wars between men and monster and killing four entire parties including his own. \n\nThe background is necessary for this to make sense. The word is separated into 2 major zones. The lands of men and the lands of monsters. These two lands are separated by a several mile wide inland sea with only 1 small land bridge crossing. This canal is patrolled by a kraken and other sea creatures. The land bridge, after many invasions of monsters over it, had a keep built upon it. This keep experienced much death and was the key point of battle for generations because it was the only safe way across the channel. This keep eventually became haunted from the shear amount of loss of life. So haunted in fact it became customary to just risk the channel, as no one made it through the keep alive.\n\nHere is where my party comes in. My party consisted of a sorcerer, fighter, rogue, oracle, and me a paladin. We were around level 15 at the time and worked decently well together. We had toppled evil liches and saved cities from certain destruction. However, the land of monsters was building an army something they had not been able to do for centuries due to constant infighting and natural violence of monsters. We were given the quest to once again destabilize these monsters by any way possible, and return them to fighting themselves. \n\nThis means traveling the channel or the land bridge. As a successful group we choose land bridge because none of us want to deal with water warfare. The DnD through the lore heavily attempts to push against this option but we cannot be dislodged from our choice. How bad could it really be?\n\nFast forward to the keep. We kill some risen skeletons and some duarger, no biggy right. Not until we provoke the spirit of the former commander of the keep. The commander as a soldier was so dedicated to his cause to defend the world of man and hold the keep he sacrificed all his men and his own life defending the keep. His dedication was so strong even in death he has defended the keep as best he can making it so treacherous to pass through. \n\nThe session ends with the party entering the commanders tower and seeing his ghostly form. The Dm then pulls me to the side after everyone goes home and asks me to do something very odd. He says he wants to have the commander possess me and fight the party by adding the graveknight template to me and changing my paladin levels to anti-paladin. He fully expects a 4 vs 1 fight to go the side of the party. I ponder this and eventually say yes under some conditions. First I build the NPC and I control my character during combat. He agrees.\n\nAs a power gamer and a DM myself I have a list of super synergy combos. On this list is graveknight and antipaladin. They go together like Pb and J. \n\nhttp://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/graveknight-cr-2/\n\nhttp://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/alternate-classes/antipaladin/#TOC-Cruelty-Su-\n\nTake a look at the links to see what I mean. So as a person who enjoys optimization and power gaming I do my best work making my new possessed  paladin. \n\nNext week next session I get possessed and the fight begins. I have ridiculous saves, smite for days, health for days, heavy fortification armor, and a +5 vorpal greatsword. This on top of my cruelties and natural spellcasting I am ready to party. I get a surprise round because getting possessed is rather surprising to the party. I proceed to quicken cast shield of darkness and eyes of the void. I am now radiating deeper darkness and can see through it. Deeper darkness is immune to see invisibility fyi. The party shoots some fireballs in and tries to cast see invisibility only to realize it does not work. I save against the fireballs and prepare for the shit show. \n\nI move into the party to blind everyone and cast black tentacles. This causes anyone who fails round by round saves to be grappled. The party at this point is losing there shit and the DM is starting to get pretty concerned. I take one glancing blow from the fighter whos swinging blind and a little fire damage from another fireball. The oracle is buffing as fast as she can and the rogue is lost because hes used to being the one who is invisible. I pick my first target. The oracle. The oracle is low armor and more spellcast based and she gets super smited with a power attack fueled full attack. She drops like a bad habit. \n\nThe sorcerer has now just started shooting randomly damaging me some, even with saves, and his own fighter. The rogue is trying to listen to where I am located so he can sneak attack me (Fortification armor ignores this anyway) and the fighter is useless without sight. Next up the sorcerer. Walk up and super smite him into nothing. The party is now pleading with me and DM to stop this. I am not listening and the DM keeps encouraging them to continue. The fighter starts a grapple with me finally and the rogue becomes grappled by my tentacles. \n\nI am just as strong as the fighter but neither of us is great with our fists and neither of us have light weapons but my touch can paralyze with cruelty. Now the fighter has high fortitude but with my template and antipaladin the save for my cruelties is rather high. It takes 3 turns to get my paralyzing cruelty through the fighters fortitude. During this time the rogue is blind and grappled. Finally I paralyze the fighter and as he is helpless I choose to coup de grace, which auto crits, which means I vorpal his head off. The rogue then watches as darkness engulfs him and I do the same to him. \n\nThe party is dead the world of monsters for future parties poors over the channel unchecked. My possessed antipaladin graveknight now forever guards the keep and raises the dead of fallen foes as his guardsman. He gains experience for every party that tempts their luck. \n\nI have personally wiped 4 full parties using these tactics and raised minions. Each DM tries to save the party by warning them through lore. It is some of the most fun I have had as a power gamer and I love being a small but powerful part of this every changing land full of old PC's most in small jobs or roles. It is truly an odd experience dropping in on a DnD game for one session and killing a party full of players you have never played with but the DM saw a note and gave you a call.\n\nPlease feel free to read my other entries that take place in this world.\n\nThank you,\n\nEdit: replaced true sight with see invisibility, missremembered ",

(cause they are LG aligned squares)\n\nPart 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5m7ymg/salad_the_necromancer_and_the_paladin_of_the_rcmp/\n\nPart 9: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/6pyc7n/pathfinder_salad_the_necromancer_and_the/\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nSo starting off I want to say that right about here Im calling it that Nik Tesla will be a Robo-Lich.... just because itd be awesome.\n\nfinding the ledge we were standing on far to small to sleep on we descend to the tropical world below, kinda, we decide that sleeping up in the branches of the hundreds of feet tall trees is probably safer than sleeping on the forest floor, Except for the elemental who turns to dirt and just lays there as a stealthy pile, and Fluffy who I ask to keep and eye out for us. This Tactic works relatively well, The branches large enough we can set up our tents and relax.\n\nPartway through the night I am awoken by a thought from Fluffy- something moving towards us in the tree tops.... I quietly awake the Paladin and get Fluffy to awake the Elemental (by pawing at the ground he was pretending to be) \nThe Paladin goes to wake the inquisitor.... only to be greeted by a butler at the door of the tent?!?!? Turns out this whole time the Inquisitor had a pocket mansion or whatever built into his tent....\n\nANYWAYS after the butler fetches the Inquisitor we gear for combat... only to see a number of huge Devil apes hooting and hollering at us from the next tree over....\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe combat was relatively brief, Salad using Circle of Death to kill off several, the Paladin killing a couple more and the Inquistor shooting one but then being thrown from the tree (its ok he can fly) as I directed Fluffy to just knock the tree over.... see Fluffy has a 55 ton pushing capacity.... sooo after a strength roll or two... TIMBEERRRRRR!!!!   and the fight was over. also I think the elemental tried to start a forest fire or two.\n\nDuring the cleanup and subsequent raising of corpses we find one that had been killed by an arrow to the back of the skull.... no one there was using a bow.... oooooo mysterious!!\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSo we have a couple options, we see 4 towers scattered throughout this lost world and The citadel as we took to calling it- option a) investigate towers- option b) bee-line for the citadel. we have 7 days till the end of the world, but its only a day/half day travel from tower to tower so we opt to investigate one.\ngetting close to the tower we peek out from some foiliage and see that there is a small compound, essentially the tower, a fence/guardhouse and a single building attached to the tower, guarded by these strange metallic constructs, humanoid in shape except for their heads which are semi opaque coloured domes...\nOf course we want to know whats inside... but Fluffly, my skeletal devil apes, the glowy angel and the dude hauling around a huge gun arent exactly stealthy.... so they stayed behind, as the elemental used their mimicking powers to look just like one of them, and I used project shadow to hide in the shadow of the elemental.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nSurprisingly it went off without a hitch and we got inside, and began to poke around, in the building attached to the tower there were banks upon banks of machinery and other strange devices and weird things showing changing flashing numbers we didn't understand so we went down the stairs in the back, to find a large circular room with only one large machine in the middle, reaching up to the roof and down to gods only know..  A panel on the side of the machine was open and one of the constructs was working on it, so of course we lept into action, first wrecking the construct, then using a mix of hydraulic push, lightning bolt and acid orbs to trash the machine..... and then we escaped as alarms were going off, displays flashing red the thing sounding like bad things were about to happen. we return to the party and they are busy asking us what the hell we were doing?!?! well we will explain in a sec, lets get further from the giant pylon of doom thats about to explode.....\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nWe hurry away and sure enough it explodes, with a strong magical wave, shredding anything in the area, including where we were standing only a short few minutes ago...\n\nDeciding to avoid any confrontations with whoever is sent to investigate we scurry away heading towards the second tower. Along the way we get caught in a huge net! after a minute of struggling we free ourselves and find a man riding a mammoth directly ahead of us, He introduces himself as Kzar and apparently he had been there since his expedition to the north pole went awry in 1920, the magical energies in the area slow aging and he's survived in this Jungle since, taming some creatures and hiding from others, it was him who killed the one Devil ape we fought he says as he warily eyes the 6 I have raised as well as Fluffy the Necro Dragon... We offer to help him get out of here if he helps us defeat Tesla, we explain how Tesla intends to drain the magic from the world and shoot it off into space, forcing dependency on his machines. Kzar agrees and we set off towards the second tower.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAt the Second Tower it was largely a case of rinse, lather repeat, we got inside and began poking around... Kzar was dissapointed as he thought we were gonna assault the tower.... cut back inside, a speaker crackles the life and a metallic voice addresses the elemental and Salad It's Nikola Tesla, he gloats a bit and says he was wondering if we were stupid enough to try the same thing twice- outside all the constructs begin advancing towards the forest, I direct Fluffy to charge, the Skeletons and other party members following suit...  The Paladin and Inquisitor wreck several of the constructs then my devil apes attack (for speed we roll once for the whole batch of them).... now see Devil apes have the ability to wreck/damage armor I crit and then the constructs failed their reflex saves- meaning that they both take the damage from the apes AND their weapons or armor take the damage, so the apes wreck all their shields making it a very one sided fight (they were based around shield bash damage) \n\nBack inside 5 of the constructs come down the stairs, its at this point we have the panel detached, and both the elemental in water form and Salad use hydraulic push to soak everyone in the room, the elemental became wind form and bugged out, and Salad used Chain lightning to... well annihilate everything- the constructs are naturally weak against electricity damage we learn, and the water boosts the damage by half again.... So we return to the heroes and tell them to bug the hell out, clearing the blast radius.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThis blast was far different, it stank of death... to the rest of the party it reminded them of the Catacombs of London (before Salad joined the party) but to Salad it was the every day feel of the same magic he used... necromancy.\nWithin the blast radius things begin to rise and attack the living or wander around aimlessly. Using spell craft and detect undead Salad looks for the biggest baddest undead in the are (I was honestly assuming it would be Fluffy) and was told there was something over that ridge.... I fly over the ride and cast command undead and it fails its saving throw, at that point the DM texts me the link to the creature's profile and I begin giggling uncontrollable, leading to full blown evil laughter.\n\nThe earth shakes... boom, boom, boom. the part members look at each other nervously, boom, boom, boom. Salad crests the hill riding his new minion, cackling wildly- an undead giganotosaurus. The Paladin turns to the Inquisitor and says \"well we may have let him get a little bit out of hand....\"",
