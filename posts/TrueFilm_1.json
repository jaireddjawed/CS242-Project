We're aiming for in-depth discussion just like you'd fine here, and we think there's a lot to talk about these days. There's a dizzying amount of original TV being created, the move to streaming has been a sweeping change in television, the dividing line between [movie star and TV actor](https://reddit.com/r/TrueTelevision/comments/q2ql06/how_come_for_a_long_time_in_the_usa_tv_acting_was/) has been erased, some TV shows aspire to be long movies [and others still embrace the episodic format](https://reddit.com/r/TrueTelevision/comments/10q08i0/poker_face_the_last_of_us_and_the_embrace_of_the/), and I'm sure some of you have thoughts about it. Maybe there's a show that never got the attention it deserved, or a show from the past that time has forgotten, or one from your country that most redditors aren't aware of, and it's worth a look? We'd love to [hear all about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueTelevision/submit).

        "text": "I'll state some of the positives first before getting to the grievances.\nThe confrontations and the suspense scenes were all executed masterfully, I was genuinely anxious during most of it. Especially the the fight off between brolin's character and the antagonist in the motel. Very few films have had such an effect on me .\n\nThe acting was very well done . Main reason for the immersion during the suspense sequences. I am no expert on cinematography and I have absolutely no idea on the technicalities of what makes a good shot and what doesn't.\nI can only judge the visuals relatively to other movies I have seen and they were pretty good ig.\n\nThe issues I have is with the plot and the character writing and the arcs.\nThere weren't much or any development for the characters. Most of them were like toys doing particular task that they were designed to do without much complexities or anything that is compelling. Brolin's character was trying to get away with the money. He was intelligent but not that much. He was arrogant and treated his wife poorly but still loved her to a certain degree. He didn't like the way his life was and took this huge risk for a dim hope for a better future. He probably had some bad memories from 'nam and probably felt that he deserved better for all his hardships. I am aware that I am contradicting my prior statements about complexities but this is nothing that hasn't been done thousands of time before hence isn't compelling. I am not implying that used tropes and arcs are automatically bad or anything but in this instance it felt bland without very much of an imagination .\n\nThe antagonist didn't have much to his character as well. All that I learned about him is that he likes killing people and doesn't really care much about the money or any other materialistic thing. He just does it for the rush of it. I can't help but compare him to the Joker and he very much feels like a discounted version.\nThe guy who was appointed to take care of the antagonist also didn't have anything to him. He was just a plot device used to tell the audience how ruthless the antagonist is. This kinda felt shallow.\n\nThe plot is very simplistic ; a classic mouse chase but with a distinct twist of sorts that the world is like ours, an unpredictable, irrational and absurd world where It doesn't matter if you're the king of the world or the main character, you can still die randomly. This was quite interesting tbh but not enough to overlook everything else.\nThe detective guy was just there showcasing his disbelief for mindless evil , affecting the plot in no way that matters.\nI don't really know what all the genius is about the ending tbh. All I got from the dream is that he will die one day as his father did. It's a metaphor about being hopeful in the face of despair and accepting one's own mortality. Please correct me if I am wrong.\nAll this just didn't feel all that extraordinary as everyone was making it out to be.\n\nOverall, a really average film which does not do much for me personally. Also I can't believe it won best picture over There Will Be Fucking Blood!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/11n1fwb/interstellar_shows_chris_nolan_at_his_most/",
        "text": "Like all impressionable film fans post The Dark Knight, Chris Nolan was a special, special film personality to me. The complexity of Inception somehow rose his status in my eyes (even if I was left a bit underwhelmed in the execution) and I thought TDKR was an admirable finish to the trilogy, flaws notwithstanding. Visiting his earlier films such as Memento, Insomnia &amp; The Prestige, I was convinced that Nolan was a building an excellent filmography and this man just could not disappoint. The greater the name you make in the world of film, the greater the expectations you set and so with the release of Interstellar, my appreciation for Nolan was at an all time high. \n\nI was terribly disappointed by Interstellar in that first cinema viewing in Fall 2014. A big reason was the poor sound design which made the dialogue not always clear and this made the sciency stuff sound even more complicated than it would have been otherwise. But then the last third began and the movie completely lost me and I did the unthinkable then. I walked out of a Chris Nolan film with a few minutes left to go. It just got too nonsensical for my taste. Although admittedly, there were stunning moments of cinema in between.\n\nI re-watched one of reddit's most favorite movies once again a few days ago and now with the aid of subtitles as well as my sour initial experience now quite removed, I did like Interstellar quite a lot. **Well at least 2/3 of it**. It's a grand movie and one of a kind. You watch Interstellar and no other movie can invoke the same, indescribable feelings this movie awakens in you. Marrying the setting of intergalactic space travel and the vastness of space with the intimate relationship between a father and daughter is a potent recipe. It is a skillfully executed concept &amp; Nolan banks on the emotion of the relationship between the father/daughter to drive the film towards it's more larger than life concepts.\n\nThe movie's marketing was not silent on how Nolan close consulted with the respected theoretical physicist Kip Thorne while making this movie, lending a sense of reality to the sci-fi ideas used in here. The mission is simple: to travel in another galaxy and explore 3 different planets from where positive signals were traced back from previously landed explorers so as to discover a planet for humanity to continue on. Nolan is assisted by a very inspired Hans Zimmer as well as a very talented vfx team to conjure up an impactful world which sucks you in quickly. The tension, pacing &amp; drama seldom take a misstep for the most part. You have to buy into the science though, even if it does not make sense to you.\n\nThen there are some dazzling moments of filmmaking which affirm why cinema is such a powerful artform and why films watched together in front of a large screen is a thing to cherish. If you ask me one of my most memorable scenes in my years of moviegoing, I can easily recall the famous 'docking scene' as one of those despite belonging to a film I had walked out of. Intensely chilling is how I would describe it. Impeccable imagery, hair-rising music &amp; powerful stakes on board. The words \"No, it's necessary\" have entered pop culture lexicon.\n\nImmediately after this masterwork of a scene, the movie takes a sharp dip imho. The characters enter a black hole and so does the movie you could say. The movie goes from being a believable science fiction to a fantasy in an instant. It is completely a fictional construct with what happens and Nolan gets to do what he loves: play with time. From this point on you either love the movie or hate it. There is no way to just sit there and be 'meh' about it. You wonder what was the point of the film. What did Nolan want to say? That love transcends time and space? Then why add so much science and sell it as a practically realistic film? And did the message even hit as well as he wanted to? The end leaves you perplexed. It is a shame because what followed before was majestic.\n\nMatthew Mcconaughey breathes a lot of life to Cooper, who like most Nolan characters, hasn't got much to show for. More than the human characters the robot characters of TARS &amp; CASE shine which isn't really a good sign. Jessica Chastain is also charismatic in her role but when is she not? The father/daughter relationship is central to the story but the resolution of this arc feels incomplete and unworthy of how it is built up. \n\nTechnically it deserves all the praises except for sound design I guess. Hans Zimmer's score is arguably the best part of the movie although it is funny that the much loved score only has a few core tracks (3-4) and the rest of the score seems to be build on top of these same tracks which keep in returning in various variations. But it is a testament to Zimmer's talent that the core 3-4 tracks are so hard hitting, haunting and deeply emotional. Perfect for the sound of intergalactic travel being driven by the power of love.\n\nNolan followed Interstellar with more grounded affairs like Dunkirk &amp; Tenet. These are colder and more practical films than Interstellar if you will. Nolan does seem to have changed post Interstellar in terms of aims/goasl although one can say that Tenet was an example that he hasn't. Oppenheimer is more Dunkirk &amp; Prestige than Inception/Interstellar. \n\nInterstellar is a film which will be remembered simply because it is one of a kind. It's a funny film in that it is riddled with flaws yet it is very fascinating. I can see someone enjoying this film 50 years in when some of Nolan's other, more complete pictures may seem dated or unenjoyable. He was able to tap into something special when dreaming up this film. It could have been a 2001: A Space Odyssey of our time. But instead it is something which was trying to become a 2001 and many other things and ended up saying nothing significant at all. It's a case of what could have been for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My rating: 6.5/10.**",

Having searched several other places and unable to find anything, posting here- hoping it can be accepted..\n\nthe last part is vague to my deeper understanding capability- especially the ending quote for father/son. Also, the part \"have a real relationship with a person that goes on for years, that’s completely unpredictable\" Does it mean predictable life is a poison for good relationship?\n\n\\*\\*“\\*\\*Andre: You know, in the sexual act there’s that moment of complete forgetting, which is so incredible. Then in the next moment you start to think about things: work on the play, what you’ve got to do tomorrow. I don’t know if this is true of you, but I think it must be quite common. The world comes in quite fast. Now that again may be because we’re afraid to stay in that place of forgetting, because that again is close to death. Like people who are afraid to go to sleep. In other words: you interrelate and you don’t know what the next moment will bring, and to not know what the next moment will bring brings you closer to a perception of death!\n\nYou see, that’s why I think that people have affairs. Well, I mean, you know, in the theater, if you get good reviews, you feel for a moment that you’ve got your hands on something. You know what I mean? I mean it’s a good feeling. But then that feeling goes quite quickly. And once again you don’t know quite what you should do next. What’ll happen? Well, have an affair and up to a certain point you can really feel that you’re on firm ground. You know, there’s a sexual conquest to be made, there are different questions: does she enjoy the ears being nibbled, how intensely can you talk about Schopenhauer in some elegant French restaurant. Whatever nonsense it is. It’s all, I think, to give you the semblance that there’s firm earth.\n\nWell, have a real relationship with a person that goes on for years, that’s completely unpredictable. Then you’ve cut off all your ties to the land and you’re sailing into the unknown, into uncharted seas. I mean, you know, people hold on to these images: father, mother, husband, wife, again for the same reason: ’cause they seem to provide some firm ground. But there’s no wife there. What does that mean, a wife? A husband? A son? A baby holds your hands and then suddenly there’s this huge man lifting you off the ground, and then he’s gone. Where’s that son?**”**  \n― André Gregory\\*\\*,\\*\\* *My Dinner With André*",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/11mwwnq/japanese_film_festival_independent_cinema/",
        "text": "This past December, the online Japanese Film Festival returned again, [this time with a focus on independent films](https://jff.jpf.go.jp/watch/independent-cinema/film-lineup/). I enjoyed the few films I caught from the early 2022 edition, so I made sure to watch all six currently released films. I wanted to share some impressions to see what other people thought of the selections and to encourage anyone who hasn't checked them out to **check them out before they leave on the 15th!** Six more will be added after these six leave on the 15th.\n\n[Double Layered Town](https://jff.jpf.go.jp/watch/independent-cinema/film-lineup/double-layered-town-making-a-song-to-replace-ourpositions/): \n\nThis is a documentary centered on [Rikuzentakata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rikuzentakata,_Iwate), a town that was destroyed by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami and subsequently had its city center rebuilt 10 feet higher than its original location. Some workshop participants visit, record the stories of the victims, recount them for the documentary and then help write short stories based on what they've heard. I've seen some reviews argue that this movie is playing too much with the idea of \"telephone\" regarding memories and records, but I didn't quite read it that way. I don't think the point is the *faultiness* of memories, but also the issue with simply trying to understand the pain and suffering they experienced. It's not only that you literally can't *remember* what the victims tell you, it's that you have very little frame of reference for actually processing it so you simply have to process it the best ways you can. You can hear this come through in some of the hesitancy and embarassment when the workshop participants have their talking head segments. That’s not to say that people are totally wrong for thinking this concept doesn’t totally work. Ultimately the most interesting part as a non-native viewer is the stories from the day of the disaster, not workshop participants retelling it. It’s still kind of interesting because a ton of stuff about the 3.11 disaster hasn’t made it’s way overseas. \n\n[Dryads in a Snow Valley](https://jff.jpf.go.jp/watch/independent-cinema/film-lineup/dryads-in-a-snow-valley/): \n\nI really enjoyed this one, we essentially just follow some rural neighbors around in [Niigata Prefecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niigata_Prefecture), in one of the snowiest towns in Japan (380+ inches a year!). I'm not sure what the formal name for this kind of documentary is, some kind of naturalist hangout/people watching I suppose? We follow these neighbors and basically hang with them as they go about their daily lives. They thatch a roof, rebuild a house, shovel snow, sing and dance, cook and care for farm animals (note: there’s one scene where a baby goat has &gt;!its horns removed!&lt; which you might find hard to watch if you’re not used to farm practices). There’s not a lot “to” this documentary, but I love learning about the daily lives of people outside of metro city centers, and I could easily watch like 5+ more hours of this. \n \n[Wonderwall](https://jff.jpf.go.jp/watch/independent-cinema/film-lineup/wonderwall-the-movie/): \n\nThis one is a short, 68 minute drama based on a real life dorm, [Yoshida/Konoe dormitory at Kyoto University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshida_dormitory,_Kyoto_University) (the [JP Wikipedia page may be of more use](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/京都大学吉田寮) to you). If the dorm looks like something out of an anime, you may in fact have seen it in [The Tatami Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tatami_Galaxy)! The dorm is notable for being the oldest standing dorm in Japan, being student run, and for being embroiled in a conflict since the late 80s with the University that wishes to tear the old structures down. This one *mostly* worked for me, but I think it needed probably about 5-10 minutes more at the start to establish *why* the dorm is so special to the students and how exactly the culture works there. It's briefly brushed on in a little overview scene, but I think it really could have used the extra meat to give the viewer more attachment to the dorm. There's also a good little  &gt;!switcheroo!&lt; in here that actually gave me a little surprise. If anyone knows of other good movies on the Japanese college student movements, I'd like to know what they are!\n\n[Somebody's Flowers](https://jff.jpf.go.jp/watch/independent-cinema/film-lineup/somebodys-flowers/): \n\nThis one is a drama focused on a family caring for a father that has developed Alzheimer’s and dealing with its impact on their lives and lives around them after a suspicious death at their apartment. I thought the main character (the son) played a brooding and conflicted son carrying grief very well. There’s also a scene towards the end &gt;!in an elevator!&lt; that just worked really well for me. The grief in that scene relates to a different kind of family death than the ones I’ve experienced in the last few years, but the expression in that scene of &gt;!the rage and resignation at those who offer you pity!&lt; really resounded in my bones. \n\n[hottamaru・days](https://jff.jpf.go.jp/watch/independent-cinema/film-lineup/hottamaru-days/): \n\nThis is a short film (37 minutes) and absolutely the \"weirdest\" of the six films. I don't think you could nail it down exactly, it's part music-dance-ASMR-soundscape experimentation based on \"house spirits\" exploring a musician's house. In fact, the audio is so important that the short film opens with a note from the director advising you to watch with headphones and the sound cranked up. Definitely do listen to that advice if you watch this one, the audio is a huge part of the experience. More than any of the other five, I think this will be one most people either really love or really hate, and I'm curious what anyone else who saw this thought of it! Personally, I found that the scenes that worked the best were generally the ones that had the musician (real life J-Pop artist Shibata Satoko) involved in some capacity. It’s probably my least favorite of the six, but it’s also probably the one I’m going to remember the most. \n\n[Leaving on the 15th Spring](https://jff.jpf.go.jp/watch/independent-cinema/film-lineup/leaving-on-the-15th-spring/): \n\nThis was probably my favorite movie of the bunch. It’s not quite an iyashikei, but it’s in a genre adjacent. It's a solid twist on the \"country kid goes to the city\" trope. Instead of the kid being headed off to the usual Tokyo, Osaka or Kyoto, the kid is headed to Okinawa. She lives on [Minamidaitō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minamidaitō,_Okinawa) a real life island that is so small that it lacks a high school, so if kids want to continue their education they’re forced to travel to the big island. This sets a classic conceit for a family drama, with a few twists to make it unique. Does a parent accompany the kid to the big island city and split apart the family? How long will the parents stay apart? Then you have the classic question of if the kid will ever even return to the island? The soon-to-be high schooler in this kid is played by Ayaka Miyoshi who you might recognize as either a former member of the idol group Sakura Gakuin, or as the star of the recent [Dance with Me](https://boxd.it/lZfi). She plays the role excellently, and I thought the actor playing her dad [(Kaoru Kobayashi, heard in Princess Mononoke and starred in 2014’s Midnight Diner)](https://boxd.it/3KVF) also played his role really well. I also have a particular soft spot for traditional Japanese instruments and the sanshin features pretty prominently here! Like I said, this is a pretty classic trope for a story, but I thought the setting provided a unique enough twist to feel different and worthwhile.",

However, I've always felt that for allegory to function, the underlying story needs to function *without the allegory,* and it feels like in this case it absolutely doesn't.\n\nChopping off one's own fingers is one of the most extreme things you could do; in a sense it's even more brutal than unaliving yourself. This is compounded by the fact that Colm is doing this to get Pádraic to leave him alone so he can pursue music, but pursuing music becomes much more difficult (if not impossible) when you start cutting off your fingers. And then the justification for this most extreme, grotesque act is... you don't want to talk to someone anymore?\n\nI feel like no connecting link of the logic makes sense. Colm would never cut off his own fingers, Colm would never expect cutting off his own fingers to get Pádraic to leave him alone, Colm has much better options to get Pádraic to leave him alone which aren't mentioned or pursued, etc. The central conflict seems entirely manufactured and fundamentally unreal, in a way that clashes with the tone which is otherwise genuinely serious and paced/set to broadcast realism.\n\nThe early part of the film really hooked me, and fixating on an odd, seemingly mundane conflict about a dude dumping his friend wasn't an issue, but as soon as Colm cut off his finger the film lost me, and never got me back. I've seen nothing but endless praise for the film, which honestly just confuses me; is there something I missed? Does this not bother anyone else? Are people willing to engage with an allegory even if the underlying narrative doesn't function?",

        "text": "I read this film as a warning about the dangers inherent in trying to self-identify as being a part of something, the blindness that can be caused by desperately wanting to belong to a group/people/nation/tribe. I felt that the journey into radicalization by Detective Gold felt maybe a bit rushed, but that could also be the point: to show us how people looking for a home, a country, an identity can be easily targeted for manipulation by extremist groups.\n\nThe ending is very bleak and devoid of any hope. After Detective Gold has been manipulated into committing a violent crime against the neo-nazis allegedly connected to the candy store murder he’s investigating, he is subsequently blackmailed for it by his ‘own people’, aka the Zionist group he is (manipulated into) feeling he desperately belongs to. They want him to betray his principles as a cop (which is probably the biggest part of his ‘real identity’) and his ‘real family’ (as his partner Sullivan calls earlier in the film), which he has already done by failing his team at the drug bust he was supposed to be at (wthis ultimately costs Sullivan his life).\n\nAs Gold finally enters into the police office, he is devastated and hears that “he’s off Homicide”. Only then is the final gut punch delivered: the candy store murder wasn’t actual part of some big neo-nazi plot, it was just a robbery. Gold has been drawn into a rabbit hole of anti-semitic conspiracy theories by this extremist group, looking for meaning, clues and connections to his personal life and identity where there weren’t any. He has started “cumming with the customers”.\n\nAfter thinking about this, I’m still left with a big question about the scale of the manipulation by the Zionists, about what was actually a ruse to lure Gold in and what wasn’t. In my head, there’s two distinct possibilities:\n\n1. The Zionist group did really believe that the murder of the old lady was part of an anti-semitic conspiracy by neo-nazis. In that case, the manipulation of Gold by the Zionists is fairly subtle: they pulled some strings to get him assigned to the case so they could play into his sense of identity as a Jew, but only the blackmail part was really a ‘set-up’. While in this case their methods are obviously still dubious, you could argue that their motives are justified, as they are convinced that their people are in danger of attacks by a neo-nazi group.\n\n2. The Zionists knew all along that it was just a robbery and the whole thing was an elaborate set-up: the way the father at the crime scene says “it never ends, does it” where Gold can hear it, leaving the ‘Grofasz’ note on the roof outside the victim’s family house, the clue to the 212 group left at the library, which led him to their group and so on. In this scenario, there is an added scale of deception: they are not only playing into his Jewish identity, but in addition creating a fake neo-nazi plot to really lure him in. Their methods and motives become much more obscure then, since they knew that there never was any threat from a neo-nazi group.\n\nIn either case the group manipulated Gold to carry out their work and his sense of self is completely shattered by the end of the film.  \nBut in the latter case, they would have actually actively created a deception for him on top of it. So I do think it matters quite a bit which interpretation you follow, both plot-wise and thematically, as it sheds a light on what the motives of the Zionist group were and how we are supposed to think of them. I wonder how other people viewed this.",

        "text": "So, let me just clear that in the beginning itself that it's just my opinion on the film and I respect the opinion others hold about the film as well and would love to hear from all of you on the same as well. To begin with, despite hearing a lot of bad things about the movie, i still dived into it as i was excited about it since it was announced. Though, i had zero expectations. \n\nBut as soon as i hit on that play button,  i never once found myself out of the place or disinterested in the film. It kept me glued to the screen mostly but lacked a couple of time might be due to the fact that it wandered around to so many places that eventually end up contributing nothing to the film's core idea or soul. \n\nHowever, it still doesn't seem to me like a bad movie. It was enjoyable, and fun most of the time. I agree that some of you might not like the graphics such as a woman peeing on someone's face or the shit pouring upon a man, but, if you look at the setting of the film then you will realize that it's an absurd world and this is how the creator has envisioned it to be. While it could be called Damien Chazzele's version of Hollywood on acid, let's just be honest, he never promised anything else. \n\nThe film was somewhere in the middle, and that was the biggest problem of it I felt, which could be the reason why most people hated it. I never felt connected to the characters. Their relationships and downfalls failed to evoke the kind of feeling they should have left us with especially when Brad committed suicide or margot robbie decided to stay back and accept fate. \n\nI guess during editing, he missed the mark because the scenes that should have shattered the audience emotionally, mostly left them oddly cold and numb despite the film being all out-and-out drama. \n\nHowever, it doesn't fail to entertain in my opinion. You could easily watch the film and come out of it without feeling what did I watch or what a waste of time it was. Each and every actor in the film did a fantastic job and they made you believe that this world existed or exists and we are a part of it. The sets were extravagant, and the cinematography does capture the essence of this fast-paced world where time runs faster than you imagine when you are at the top. As the film progresses, you can see that it gets a bit slow for brad as his stardom starts to fade away. \n\nAt one point, it was almost there with the \"Wolf of the wall street\", but then lacked to build a relationship between the audience and the characters. Though I do have another opinion about it as well, the reason to present the movie so cold on emotions could be because he wanted to depict clearly that it is indeed a cold world and there is no place for emotions or warmth in this world. \n\nYet, I feel it managed to keep me entertained, and hooked to the screen till the end. Yes, it was stretchy at parts, especially the ending, which I feel he ruined by not ending the movie at the theatre itself when the camera zooms out to show the people sitting in the hall, while the character is having a breakdown or experiencing a euphoric moment.",

        "text": "**Do the Right Thing** (1989) is a cult racial thriller directed by Spike Lee, a well-known black director whose films are always surrounded by heated debates, provocative questions, and criticisms. In this timeless film, the heat, need, and nonsense of a cosmopolitan neighborhood dissolve mutual understanding and empathy, leaving the human body covered in sweat.\n\nChoosing to cover an American film on a racial theme raises the question of its relevance to the harsh realities of modern Russia, particularly Siberia. While modern Russia is a more multinational and multiracial state than the United States, America devotes significantly more words, paper, and film to understanding and confronting racism. This is due to specific historical reasons that cannot be reduced to arguments about *the dying West* and *Russia rising from its knees*. My country's history is replete with conflicts on racial and national grounds, some of which we are witnessing today. Many such conflicts are culturally reflected in a sketchy, confused way, partly due to inappropriate optics and partly due to a ban on reality which is being implemented in Russia right now. Thus, the story of African Americans, American Italians, and Koreans who can't get along can tell us a lot about the Russian reality, where racism has the same devastating effect on the human body.\n\n*Please note that I may not be able to avoid spoilers in this text, even though I will try to reveal the film's ending in general terms. Therefore, if you plan to watch Do the Right Thing, I recommend finishing the film before reading my text.*\n\nIn recent years, Spike Lee has stated that only white viewers ask why the main character throws a rubbish bin through a pizza shop window in the climactic scene of his film. However, the author believes that viewers of all races were likely pondering the actions of the characters, and that Lee's rhetoric transforms the film's conciliatory process into an accusatory one. The author notes that while the film's elements were likely conceived as a means of integrating national culture into a multicultural society on terms of unqualified equality, Lee's rhetoric and actions in the film suggest that these elements have become an end in themselves.\n\nThe author questions the effectiveness of actions such as putting a piece of paper on a burnt wall or assaulting a man for a broken tape recorder, suggesting that these actions do not effectively combat the heat of racism. The author argues that the actions of the characters in the film are driven by blind hatred rather than self-defense, and that the violent actions of the multi-ethnic crowd only serve to answer senseless hatred with senseless hatred.\n\nThe author notes that while the director himself becomes a hero in the film, this is a testament to the film's ability to incorporate real characters and events relevant to the issue of race relations. The author suggests that a truce may be possible in the midst of destruction and turmoil, but that this truce is fleeting and fragile. The author also notes that there is no place in Spike Lee's art for love that penetrates racial barriers, and that love only smolders within closed, relatively stable communities. The author questions whether there is a more effective alternative to the use of brute force to enforce respect for history and culture. The film's finale suggests that the portrait of the history may either be supplanted by opposing viewpoints or hang alone on a neighbor's wall.\n\nThe filmmaker's surprise at the persistence of racial anxiety and tension may be understandable, given the passage of time and the various efforts made to promote racial equality and understanding. However, it is also worth considering the complex and systemic nature of racism, which cannot be easily solved by a single film or even a series of social initiatives.\n\nMoreover, it is important to acknowledge that the persistence of racial tensions is not solely the fault of one particular group or individual. Racism is a deeply ingrained and pervasive problem that affects individuals, institutions, and societies in complex ways. Therefore, it is crucial for all of us to continue engaging in open, honest, and respectful dialogue about race, and to work together towards a more just and equitable future.",

It’s creepy and yet unfortunately realistic - we’ve all known a Carrie White, an outcast.

The film is preaching nihilism but trying to shine a positive light on it which to me is an extremely millennial and childish ideology. The best things I can say about the film are that it has a couple solid performances, a handful of cool shots, and great editing. The only part I found particularly creative was when Evelyn and Joy became rocks and communicated through on screen text like a silent film with the aesthetic of a bad motivational poster. I can barely understand how this film was green-lit much less was nominated for best picture. The scene where Joy beats a group of people bloody with giant dildos seems to me the perfect metaphor for how this film beats it’s audience over the head with its thinly conceived and incredibly pretentious message.\n\nAm I missing something or are there others who felt this way?",

        "text": "For my last video I covered what I viewed to be the main issues of the new Ant-Man threequel (link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfVHyL\\_0tQQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfVHyL_0tQQ)). In the video I focused more broadly on how the pandemic negatively impacted creative choices in the film, but I wanted to focus in on a more specific point regarding technology and less so the overall quality of product. \n\nIt was reported that Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania would make use of the Mandalorian's virtual studio known as The Volume. I’ve always felt that the show made good use of that technology to create a false sense of space and depth. But I found it hard to put my finger on exactly how the Mandalorian managed to make the world feel immersive while Quantumania did the exact opposite. \n\nMost of Quantumania suffers from a soundstage feel where most scenes seem like a small minimalist set that is expanded by a slightly out-of-focus CGI panorama (The Volume walls allegedly). My only conclusion to draw would be that the Volume is a very poor creative match for Marvel. They are infamous for not having pre-visualization done in time for when the cameras start rolling. But the Volume is at its most advantageous for productions where the virtual elements have been built out- if not polished yet- so that the camera can react to a simulated environment while the actors have something to react to besides a blank green screen. \n\nYou could also say that lack of pre-planning in blocking is also an issue as the actors in Quantumainia just seem to stand on their marks and their movements are stiff and minimal. Compare that to the Mandalorian who reacts authentically within his environment and his (virtual) surroundings. \n\nI guess what I’m getting down to is that PLANNING is the big difference between the two. The Volume comes alive in the hands of creators that have the entire scene mapped out including extensive pre-production elements. It works poorly with a company like Marvel which struggles to get elements together before shoot dates due to the amount of spinning plates they're trying to balance. \n\nBut that is just my read of why this new technology works great in one scenario and terrible in another. I’m interested to hear what some of you all think- especially those of you with a more detailed understanding of how the Volume functions within the full production process.",

The OP received downvotes not only on the post itself, but on almost every single comment they made.\n\nIf you thought the thesis was bad, that’s fair. If you thought the argument was poor, that’s fair. If you thought the tone of the post was condescending, that’s also fair.\nBut! I can only quote the rules of this specific subreddit: “Be civil and don’t downvote opinions. Nothing is less conducive to discussion than a discouraging tone.”\n\nI know that by posting this, I myself is breaking the rules and maybe that makes me a hypocrite. And maybe this post will be removed. But I really think tolerance of other’s opinions, even if “badly” formulated, is the most important thing for a subreddit dedicated to in-depth discussions.\n\nSo again, please be civil. Just a little prayer from a strong supporter of this subreddit. Thank you",

Look for example Stanley Kubrick, somebody who did nothing else than adapting other people's work. Vladimir Nabokov, Anthony Burgess and Stephen King all took great issue with his changes. And yet he's regarded as one of the most innovative and distinctive auteurs in history.\n\nOr just look at an adaption like Starship Troopers; the whole film is basically a biting satire of the ideas presented in the book, characterizing them as fascistic and dystopian. It's a great film, and very disrespectful to the writer.\n\nAnytime I try arriving at a definitive conclusion I always end up in the same confused place, so I was hoping to hear some differing ideas.",

        "text": " In Toy Story 2, the antagonist, The Prospector, argues that toys should not engage with children. He insists that these relationships are superfluous because they are doomed to fail. The rest of the Roundup Gang comes to the conclusion that they should engage with these relationships, because it's better than sitting behind glass at a museum.\n\nBut my question is, is the Prospector really wrong? Of course, he was wrong to force his beliefs onto the toys. And it makes sense. Sitting behind glass at a museum sounds like a miserable existence. And I get the metaphor. It's preferable to take risks and open your heart even if you're scared of being heart.. versus rotting in seclusion.\n\nBut my question is, is this message flawed at all? While yes, it's certainly better to open your heart and engage with people, despite the risk of being hurt - would you really want to enter a relationship that is absolutely certain to end? The relationship toys have with their owners is not just \"oh, this might end one day, but I'll take the risk.\" The children \\*will\\* outgrow the toys and leave them. It's a certainty and they know it. Can you imagine entering a romantic relationship with someone who tells you upfront they're going to leave you one day? It just sounds like a horrible cycle for the characters.\n\nA possible rebuttal is that the toys don't always revolve their lives solely around the owners and have each other. Showcased especially by Woody telling Buzz he can handle Andy growing up because he'll still have Buzz afterwards. Perhaps it's okay and healthy if the person knows and accepts the relationship is finite. So, what do you all think? I'm not necessarily stating if it's flawed or not, but I'd like to see a discussion about this.",

        "text": "I saw *Tár* last night and I enjoyed it, but it was kind of a frustrating film because I feel like Todd Field was too coy a storyteller.\n\nSo much of what does happen in the film is only subtly hinted at, and there's a mountain of backstory that's never mentioned in the film, but again, only vaguely hinted at.\n\nIt was a stark difference from his previous film, *Little Children,* which painted with more broad strokes and hit its plot points with greater conviction and gusto.\n\nPerhaps the disjointed presentation was meant to convey how all of our lives can seem a bit like a blur in retrospect. And perhaps the fact that we saw no flashback scenes between Lydia &amp; Krista (aside from the one dream sequence) was to convey how she was trying to repress her time with her due to the guilt.\n\nGiven the runtime, I think more time should've been spent actually giving us some scenes of Lydia, Francesca, and Krista in Peru together. There were plenty of places that could've been trimmed to accommodate this, and I would've liked to see the characters in that context.\n\nSo much of the environments they're in are so perfect, so pristine, I would've liked to see a scene of Lydia, Francesca, and Krista in Peru, by the fire, listening to the native singing.\n\nInstead of having the opening credits over black, I think Field should've shown us something and established the theme of sexual tension before the interview scene.\n\nIt was a good film, but I can't help but feel like it's still a rough sketch. Like a draft that hasn't been inked yet, and is missing a few pages.\n\nI'd watch it again, though. Now that I've filled in the gaps.",

One that popped up was of course _Triangle of Sadness_.\n\nWe're not particularly 'art house' film buffs, we go into movies for escapism and relaxation, but this looked like an interesting mix of social commentary and some amusing story line, so we went for it.\n\n(There's spoilers here, natch...)\n\nGeneral\n\nThe movie absolutely had a Kubrick feel to it.  The cinematography, with long slow paced silent shots (the discussion between Carl and Yaya in the hotel room being a good example.  That was 10m long, and had only about 30 words in it).\n\nI feel that the trailers really sold the movie in a direction it didn't go.  Woody Harrolson's part was relatively minor, and it looked like it might be something akin to _The Menu_ - but that wasn't it at all.  It was dark and sad and intense and thoughtful, and yes, disturbing in a lot of ways.\n\nSpecific plot stuff\n\nOkay, so the BIGGEST one for me is the ending.  In the imdb trivia section, it states that Abigail does in fact kill Yaya on the beach, though it's not shown.  I just don't understand WHY?!?  Jealousy?  Was Yaya such a horrible person and Abigail was in love with Carl?  Was it just pent up anger at the class divide between her (the skilled, competent lower class worker and the rich but ultimately useless upper class)?\n\nI feel the movie had a problem with, on the one hand, being a great social commentary on the entitled ultra rich, a weird mix of a love triangle, and a vaguely gross comedy (I can't tell if everyone getting sick at the Captain's meal was supposed to be comedic). \n\nThen there was this vague handwave about pirates.  They were there or not there?  A grenade exploded on the deck, and there was the view from the 'pirate' boat, but that was all there was.\n\nSome of the characters I thought were absolutely brilliantly portrayed.  Dmitri the russian 'shit' dealer was perfect.  Abigail character was enigmatic.  Paula (the cruise director) was clinging so hard to her rigid view of How The World Should Be.  \n\nOthers were mystifying.  Jarmo (the software engineer) was a weird mix - very difficult to identify with.  He seemed to 'grow into' his space as he's the one who ultimately killed the donkey, something the others couldn't do, but I feel his character space was wasted.\n\nSo, an interesting movie.  I'm not sure I can recommend it as \"this has something that people want to see\" - maybe I'm missing something?",

A propaganda film designed to inspire the troops to resist the Allies, this film follows the Prussian troops defence of Karlberg from the French in the Napoleonic Wars. Veit Harlan (infamous for the antisemitic film Jud Sub just a few years prior, and the only filmmaker to be tried in the Nuremburg trials) directs with over 5,000 German troops, otherwise meant to be at the Western and Eastern fronts that were now failing, acting as extras in the giant battle scenes. The budget for this film looked astronomical.\n\nVeit Harlan in an interview (and it was a documentary on him that I watched prompting this post) stated that he filmed very brutal and violent battle scenes costing up to 2 million reichsmark. Scenes of doors being blown up, a Prussian leader's gory death, a baby being blown up and buried. Goebbels saw these scenes as too violent for his propaganda, meant to inspire the German troops, not depress them, and ordered all this footage cut.\n\nMy question is -- is this cut footage still available? Is there some film restoration place out there that restored the film as the director originally intended?\n\nI'd be interested to see this bizarre Nazi propaganda epic, with the full scenes it was supposed to have. Although part of me also suspects that this may have been apologia from Veit Harlan for his involvement in making propaganda for the Nazis, as the documentary made clear he was not one for moral self-reflection in his career, and viewed his time making movies under the direction of Goebbels and being complicit in the propaganda as sacrifices he had to make to make movies.\n\nIt's an interesting discussion, and I'm sure even in the state it was theatrically released the film would be a memorable watch.",

The wave of emotions that this movie made me feel, from the feeling of dread and regret as you watch Jim Carrey’s character delete all of these beautiful, once-in-a-lifetime memories, to the strange feeling I felt at the end of hope coupled with doubt, just absolutely blew me away.\n\nI’m 20 years old and had never seen it before, until my dad offered to show it to me since we both had the day off and I’m home from school for a week. For whatever reason, this movie suprised the hell out of me and impacted me in a way I never thought it would when we started watching it. It also sparked an interesting conversation between my dad and I about how important memories of failed relationships are, and how we are both of the opinion that those memories are too important, the good and the bad, to be let go of.\n\nSuch a great film and one that I will surely be talking to my friends and family about for a while. Just wanted to share my thoughts and say that I am thoroughly impressed.",

        "text": "I'd like to preface by mentioning that I have seen a lot of films, (maybe not as much as an art house film buff) but more than average. I have also seen a lot of space films, including the Alien franchise, interstellar and other dark space epics.\n\nSo why have I not seen 2001? Especially after seeing all these other great films which are quite similar? Well, ignorance to be honest and laziness. \n\nThe fact that the film is a U rating (UK) and being from 1968 put me off all these years, but now I have gotten older and appreciate film a lot more, I can give these classics a go.\n\nKubrick is familiar to me already, after watching The Shining, Clockwork Orange, Full Metal etc, you know the presentation is going to be good, so I did expect that.\n\nWhat I wasn't expecting however is how impressive the visual presentation 2001 was for 1968! The space ships in space and internal sets were exceptionally well presented along with the final scene of visual lights etc.\n\nAlthough I can see this film was ahead of its time in terms of film production, the actual message behind the film (although subjective to a degree) was equally as impressive. I have my own thoughts about how this film has poked the inner self, to question why we are here, which I guess is why this film has stuck with me since watching it.\n\nYou can defiantly see the movie has influenced lots of space flicks since, such as Alien - as different movies came to mind throughout the film.\n\nI wouldn't want to overhype this film, as I understand in some peoples minds this film has already been overhyped. But what I would say, to those who are a little shy of older films, is to give this one a try, especially if you enjoy space and how man may progress beyond Earth some day.\n\nMy format experience was from the DVD remastered version, the quality was excellent - played on a Sony Blu-ray player on a 50\" 4k TV.",

It wasn’t doing anything special compared to the other series of psychological horror, A24-esque films we’ve gotten over the past decade. I want to say the director was ***trying*** to make it contrived to appease mass audiences, because it doesn’t feel like a film meant for people who likes psychological horror.\n\nThe characters felt entirely unrealistic. You can really feel when a film is treating their characters as plot devices more than living breathing beings. No depth there at all. The film asks way too much of you in regards to the plot circumstances too. And when the female lead figures out how to get away…man, it felt lazy, half concocted and just thrown in. They really must have cut a LOT from this film, I’d be curious how the directors cut would enhance some of the themes and storylines. \n\nIt wasn’t bad necessarily, but it wasn’t good. I’d rank it on par with Old (the Shyamalan film). Pretty average, teetering on bad, but intriguing in premise enough to want to finish it.",

There's definitely still some errors in here, but there won't be *that many;* it should be fine for casual use. If you want to use this for something serious, note that I was trying to make the listings consistent, not perfect (If two people both gave the wrong information, I didn't even try to fix it, I only fixed things where people submitted contrary information).\n\nAlso note, this is the combined director and critics' poll, because they didn't tell us who was in which poll.

I don't think it's necessarily the black and white factor either but more tone, setting, just general eeriness.

I’d like to consider myself a pretty seasoned film buff but for some reason or other I’ve never actually watched anything by Kurosawa until recently and damn was I missing out.\n         The first thing that absolutely stuck out to me was just how damn gorgeous this film was. Every single frame was worthy enough to print out and hang on my wall. The one scene that sticks out to me was the all out carnage and beautifully constructed chaos of Tazaemons raid on Tokuemons gang hideout when Sanjuro is escaping the town by pretending to be a dead body in the that weird vase thing. It was so good! The wide view of all the destruction in the town with a vase carrying a supposedly dead body framed perfectly in the mid ground perfectly encapsulated the entire vibe of the movie. Another part that absolutely knocked my friggin socks off was when Sanjuro initiates the gang war between the two clans for the first time and climbs up on top of the platform in the middle of town to watch them fight. I loved the camera movement when Sanjuro moved his head to the left and the camera panned to the left with him to bring one clan into view, then when he moved his head to the right the camera moved with him to show the other clan. Maybe it was just the fact that it was one fluid cut but for some reason it impresses the hell outta me.\n       The antagonist in my humble opinion, is just another one of the reasons why this film is a masterpiece. Ushitora is by far one of the best villains I have ever seen plainly because of just how bad he is, and damn does he look cool as hell being it. What I love about him as a character is he flies in the face of everything that makes a samurai a samurai. He lies, he kills without honor, and instead of getting his hands dirty he uses thugs to rough people up. It’s no mistake that the very first scene we are introduced to him, he approaches the mayor of the town and says “wanna see something interesting?” Before pulling out a handgun and firing it, shocking everyone. And his death scene…….. holy shit was in completely in character for him. After Sanjuro disarms him (pun intended) by throwing a dagger into his shooting arm and slicing him in the belly, the mayor comes out banging on the prayer drum for all the fallen in the village  only for Ushitora to rebuke him and tell him to not bother praying for him because he’d be banging on that drum for years. Oh my god I love it!!! And when Sanjuro approaches him, he lies and says that he’d feel naked dying without his revolver in hand. Since Sanjuro is unfamiliar with firearms he reluctantly passes it to him because Ushitora lies and tell him it only holds two rounds. Right before he’s able to shoot him, he bleeds out. This perfectly shows the character of both men. Sanjuro, being an honorable warrior obliges his dying wish and Ushitora being a dishonorable killer attempts to kill him by lying and taking advantage of his honor. They very much are the yin to each others yang.\n      These are just a few of my thoughts about this masterpiece. What do you guys think?",

        "text": "SPOILERS:::\n\n \n\nDavid Lynch is in many ways known for being surreal and supernatural. However, the supernatural aspect is questionable in the majority of his works. Obviously there is no real supernatural element to The Elephant Man, The Straight Story, or Blue Velvet. Dune is a sci-fi based on a novel so its kind of in it's own category.\n\nWild at Heart is a interesting one. It doesn't seem supernatural for most of it but the elements of wizard of oz, especially with the good witch which adds a fantasy element. Of course it can be argued that these fantasy aspects are all in the characters' heads.\n\nI think Mulholland Drive and Lost Highway are mostly up to interpretation. The popular theories of both films would argue that what's happening is entirely psychological but there are definitely other ways of looking at it. The bum outside winkies and the blue box certainly seem supernatural but are they only dream symbols? Lost Highway might be more possible to claim it has supernatural aspects because of the Mystery Man who doesn't really have a clear explanation and the fact that the whole film is a mobius strip.\n\nEraserhead seems to be more in the category of supernatural in my opinion. The film has been described as a dream in which things are amplified and distorted from reality but there are so many supernatural aspects. Mutant babies, man made chickens who squirt blood, and a women with giant cheeks who live in a radiator. It can be argued these are all distorted versions of real life or fantasies of Henry Spence but what makes it really supernatural to me is the concept of the man in the planet controlling things. It is kind of a metaphor but so is most things in Lynch.\n\nThe two Lynch works that I can say are most supernatural are Twin Peaks and Inland Empire. Twin Peaks obviously has the black lodge, the white lodge, Bob, The Angels, Judy, The fireman, the woodsmen, dopplegangers and countless other supernatural beings. FWWM painted a picture that it could all be the characters' ways of dealing with Trauma but season 3 doubled down and made it clear there are more and more supernatural beings and alternate dimensions. Everything in the Twin Peaks universe represents something but it is more than metaphor in how it influences the story.\n\nIMO Inland Empire is most like Twin Peaks in that it also features supernatural beings controlling things like the Phantom, The rabbits and the whores plus the whole concept of a cursed story makes it more clear. There is tons of metaphor in Inland Empire but again the story doesn't work at all if you can't accept the supernatural, especially towards the end when Dern's character dies, wakes up, travels through different dimensions, skills the phantom and breaks the curse.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on David Lynch and the supernatural? What films do you think show reality and unreality?",

        "text": "This article contains a lot of film stills. For a fully illustrated version please click here -[https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/placing-kiarostamis-and-life-goes-on-in-context/](https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/placing-kiarostamis-and-life-goes-on-in-context/)\n\nI’m not sure why Kiarostami objected to positioning his three films, *Where is The Friends House?*, *And Life Goes On*, and *Through The Olive Trees* as a trilogy, but they are all certainly tied tightly together. Perhaps it was important to him that each one stand alone on its own merits, which they do. They are all masterful movies, each one with its own complex mixture of documentary and fiction, but they do gain quite a bit of depth when seen in chronological succession. \n\n[**Where is The Friends House?**](https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/kiarostamis-where-is-the-friends-house/) is the first film and is a relatively straightforward narrative. It concerns a young boy trying to find his friend who lives in a neighboring town. It is a beautiful film, one of Kiarostami’s best. It’s simple, and deeply moving. \n\nKiarostami completed filming *Where is The Friends House?* in 1987 in a small rural village called Koker. Three years later, an earthquake shook Iran, killing 50,000 people and leaving countless others homeless. *And Life Goes On* is a film about Kiarostami trying to make his way back to Koker over closed highways and collapsed roads to see if the young boys he filmed in 1987 were still alive. \n\n*And Life Goes On* combines truth and fiction, scripted and spontaneous, actors and real people, to produce something uniquely compelling and insightful. Kiarostami himself is not in the film. He is played by an actor, Farhad Kheradmand, but the journey is real. Kiarostami was there with Kheradmand as they searched for the young actors. The destruction they saw along the way, the people they spoke with, and the painful stories of death and chaos that they heard are real. Even with so much of the film having all these elements of a documentary, Kiarostami manages to shape the search for the boys into a replaying of *Where is The Friends House?* Both films are about someone searching for a young boy somewhere in the tangled and disordered streets of Koker. In *Where is The Friends House?,* a boy named Babak Ahmadpour (his name in both the movie and real life) is searching for his friend Mohammad Reza. In *And Life Goes On*, the roles are sort of reversed, in that Kiarostami is searching for Ahmadpour.\n\nKiarostami has an incredible knack for taking something very small and very simple and imbuing it with immense import and meaning. The whole film is just a man looking for a kid, but through symbolism and resonance, the journey expands into a universal story about destruction, persistence, intimate connections, loss, and hope. \n\nKiarostami’s stand-in, Kheradmand, has his son with him in the back seat. The boy is maybe 10 years old. Having a second person in the car is an opportunity to have spoken dialogue that reveals their thoughts. However, Kiarostami also uses the son’s naive egocentrism to illustrate how each person must process this immense tragedy in their own way. The child wants a bottle of Coke and they find a few dust and rubble-covered bottles in the wreck of a store. The boy reaches for one and is annoyed that it is warm. He’s only a child and his lack of a larger empathetic insight is simply a sign of his immature emotional development, but it gives the audience a chance to see the difficult relationship between a spectator and a victim. I know I watched the footage of the earthquake from my cushy couch in my heated living room with a nicely chilled soda on the coffee table. \n\nWatching the suffering is painful and part of our natural response is to find ways to separate it from ourselves, to contain it. Without any thoughts of racism or nationalism, we create an “us and them” dynamic to comfort ourselves. “This didn’t happen to me, or my family and friends, it happened to them.” Kiarostami emphasizes this point by allowing us to see and feel the class difference between the city-dwelling, upper-middle-class film director, and all the considerably poorer rural people he encounters.\n\nThere are other layers to the film. Kiarostami repeats a few scenes from different points of view. We see some of the landscape more than once as it passes by the car window. It lends a dreamlike quality to the journey. Kiarostami is always shifting the level of reality in the film.\n\n*And Life Goes On* was also released under an alternate title, *Life, and Nothing More*. On the poster is a quote from one of the quake victims who said, “The Earth moved and we didn’t.” This quote and the alternate title help to further expand the scope of the film. “The Earth moved and we didn’t” could refer to rural Iran’s being stuck in the past. It could also mean that the Iranian people were strong enough to weather the earthquake. Either way, Kiarostami focuses on the endurance of the victims. All through the film, we are faced with rubble and dust, but in every scene of destruction, there are dozens of people hard at work trying to regroup and rebuild. Kiarostami’s love and admiration for the people of Iran is always evident in his films.\n\nKiarostami has strong neo-realist sympathies, and so seeks out the “everyman.” His productions rarely use professional actors, and generally do not contain much artifice like crane shots or elaborate lighting. He looks for real people with real stories. He finds drama in ordinary places amidst ordinary people, but even with his pursuit of straightforward connections to reality, he allows for layers of distinctions. He uses formalist hints to remind the viewer that no matter how naturalistic the movie may appear, there is an element of constructed narrative. There is a storyteller, behind the story. Between the audience, the story, the storyteller, and the performers, there is an ever-shifting relationship that governs our perception. If you see *Where is The Friend's House?* first, you will know who Kheradmand is searching for. You will remember the sweet boy who so earnestly sought his friend. However, in watching *And Life Goes On,* Kiarostami searches not for that boy, but for the actor who played the boy, who happens to go by the same name and live in the same place as that boy. Is Kiarostami searching for the real boy or the character the boy played? What is the true connection between the real Kiarostami and the real boy?\n\nThe last film in what is referred to as *The Koker Trilogy* is *Through* *The Olive Trees*. It is an even more complex tangle of truth and fiction. It depicts the making of *And Life Goes On*. Personally, I find it the least compelling of the three. Kiarostami tries to fashion a self-referential exploration of how we tell stories, but ends up producing something a little too academic and self-centered. The first two films have a compelling story at their core. The last film is more like a reflexive onion that is intellectually interesting, but has less of a solid story to ground it.\n\nEach film can stand on its own, but they enrich each other by progressively breaking apart the inner workings of not only filmmaking, but of storytelling itself. These themes and ideas would continue to be at the center of all of Kiarostami’s work for the rest of his career.",

But I also think Citizen Kane was also Welle's greatest folly. I think Hollywood felt intimidated by Welles because of Citizen Kane and Welles really became public enemy #1 with the only person that could ruined anyone in the U.S, William Randolph Hearst.\n\nAfter Citizen Kane, Welles lost control of The Magnificent Ambersons and was butchered and 40 Minutes of the film was cut. The Stranger was one of few films that Welles made that had little interference. The Lady from Shanghai had lots of Studio Interference. His Macbeth was truncated. His Othello had 3 different versions. Touch Of Evil has Studio Interference. The Trial, Chimes At Midnight, and F for Fake were along with Citizen Kane and The Stranger were the chosen few that Welles had complete control over.\n\nNot only that Orson Welles had a lot of Projects that were unfinished (Don Quixote, The Deep, The Merchant of Venice). and Films he wanted to make (Heart Of Darkness, Santa, The Life Of Christ, Moby Dick, Around The World In 80 Days) exc. as Welles couldn't find funding or he couldn't finish them. Although one film, The Other Side Of The Wind was finish and released on Netflix.\n\nDo you think Hollywood hated Orson Welles?",

The list ends when the top 100 from critics and top 100 from directors are all included.\n\nYou can find the letterboxd list [HERE](https://letterboxd.com/rant423/list/2022-sight-sounds-greatest-films-of-all-time/).

All I knew about this film beforehand was the [gorgeous title track by master of Portuguese guitar Carlos Paredes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwhV1ivYNsQ) and one particular shot, commonly used as the film's defining image in recent times - [a young, shy couple, staring at each other](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzg5ZTIxYjQtMjlhNS00NDA2LThkMmMtZjUzMzRiYzU0MGYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjMwNDQwNA@@._V1_.jpg). That was all I knew of the plot, too - young adult from a rural region goes to the big city during our dictatorship years, meets a girl of a similarly lower class, sweet romance (or a heartbreak a-la *Brief Encounter*) ensues. I grew up with these stereotypes, this ingrained idea of *Os Verdes Anos* as a monument to naivety, youthful love, the simplicity of a life long ago.\n\nIn some ways, this film is, and achieves, that. It first lulls you (lulled me, at least) into this blooming, gentle romance between Júlio, a poor shoemaker coming from the countryside and who is almost paralysed by the hustle and bustle of a big, intimidating (and as we come to find out, corruptive) city, and Ilda, maid to the arrogant (and incestuous) upper-class.\n\nExactly what makes the movie so beautiful to watch, is the same thing that ends up causing the unforeseen tragedy in the plot. You're lulled into a romance with its backdrop in a growing city, full of beautiful vistas and great buildings - it's shot so well, starts so tender, and again naïve, that you forget the subtle, darker sides to Lisbon until they all suddenly strike at once and the story takes a decisive, dark and admittedly brutal turn. They hint at it from the very beginning - Júlio is not picked up at the train station by his uncle, who gets convinced by his friends to join them for beers and tremoços. Right from the very beginning it warns the viewer: well-intentioned people can be brought to the dark here. It's a joyful scene that opens the movie - beers being filled and friends having a good time as the credit rolls in - but it is also an omen, foreboding that not all is light and sun in Lisbon.\n\nAfter that, you're introduced to the two lovers, who meet after Júlio (again, a newcomer to the urban world and still wholly innocent - green), gets locked inside a residential building by accident and does not know how to leave without the help of Ilda. They later meet again and hit it off, travelling through the city together in what is maybe the most aesthetically gorgeous part of the movie - their walks through the old city of Lisbon are delicious to watch, especially for any Portuguese person or anyone who has been to Lisbon. I was stunned that there used to be so much greenery - together they walk through hilly areas, countryside, the untamed nature of a burgeoning city whose urban sprawl was afoot, but had not yet reached further surroundings. Of note is also the famous dressing room scene, where Ilda dresses in her bosses' chic clothing - perhaps of the greatest scenes in Portuguese cinema history, with a [brilliant millisecond of unspoken passion by Júlio that I just couldn't get out of my head](https://imgur.com/a/tn8m32S). \n\nWhat happens after this halfway point is, as I mentioned before, a dramatic turnaround. I'll leave the details of the ending out so you can experience it by yourself, but the city and its people finally show their true colours (in black and white) here. Júlio's innocence gradually corrupted. Ilda finding herself between the rough misogyny of society, a boyfriend rapidly shifting toward darkness, and bosses a world apart. The until now unfelt sensation of looming tragedy. It all sets in astoundingly quick - before you even have time to realise things have changed. A lot of criticism online for Os Verdes Anos stems from this rapid decay, and sometimes the pacing can feel off (particularly due to censorship cuts of important and character-building scenes by our secret police, PIDE), but you get to the end, think about it and realise that unhappiness awaited Ilda and Júlio from the beginning.\n\nThe final shot, in the words of Manoel de Oliveira, present \"Lisbon as a claustrophobic dead-end; more than a political regime - a country that does not offer a future to its inhabitants.\" A man overwhelmed, beaten, defeated by urban life. Incapable of melding into a society that was not built for people like him.\n\nOs Verdes Anos is a world of paradoxes. A country rapidly developing on the surface but profoundly stuck in the past. A relationship that's blooming but not destined to go anywhere. A dictatorial regime solely of image, presenting itself as the saviour of a country and people it is entirely disconnected from. Love and violence, innocence and corruption. It is the green of a young tree against darkness of a midnight street.",

It was a decision made by its creator who feels that the main plot of the series has run its course and the character arcs have been resolved to a level that he can confidently end it with this season.\n\nI feel this kind of thing is usually a rarity in succesful franchises/ TV shows. Usually if something is success it would keep running as long as it making money. Even if the main plot of the series has long since concluded and the character arcs have already been resolved, the franchise wil keep going on because it still makes money despite the fact that artistically the franchise has done everything it had set out to do.\n\nLook I get that entertainment business is well a business. I understand that studios need to make money to keep the business going on and art will be a secondary concern to that. If MCU movie no. 31 will even get Disney 100 million more than it cost them to make and distribute then obvious they will keep doing it.\n\nAt the same time it is so damn frustrating though as a consumer. Stories have value for me because they end. I want to follow the characters that I care about to the natural end of their arcs and not through bland repetitive entries when its pretty clear that it is time to retire the franchise. It is natural to want to see the media you love end on a high note rather than a disappointing whimper.\n\nYes I know I can just watch standalone films. And those are obviously great too. But I really do love serialised storytelling. I love following a story through the years where I get the satisfaction of looking back from the end of the road and seeing how far we have come. It is what makes TV shows like Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, Mad Men so great to me. And I just wish that the major Hollywood franchises that I love would also operate on that basis rather than to chug along for the sake of chugging along.",

Watching all the interviews and award show speeches where he jubilantly, effusively triumphs with one emotional speech after another. The late show, tonight show, SAG awards, Golden Globes, ect. It's exciting. Heartwarming. His story is so powerful! His life has such a dramatic arc! Soon enough I was getting sucked down a similar Michelle Yeoh rabbit hole.\n\nThis got me thinking again about an idea that has popped up here and there in my movie-enjoyment experience the last couple years. I'm sure this idea has been studied by people smarter than me often enough: when we see a famous actor on screen, an actor we have some idea about as a person outside this movie, are we seeing their character or are we seeing the actor? Obviously this effect is minimized in the case of lesser-known actors, and character actors who effectively are unrecognizable part to part. This stops being minimized in the case of famous character actors, actors who are publicly famous for their ability to transform into this or that role, Daniel Day Lewis being the classic example, Christian Bale being a sort of hybrid of the above two celebrities.\n\nI'm of the belief that we – the audience we – conscientiously choose to see famous actors when we knowingly make the choice to buy a particular ticket to a Hollywood movie with a known Hollywood actor. Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, Tom Cruise, Will Ferrell, Leonardo DiCaprio are all examples that jump to mind. These male celebrities are of such an elevated public status that I believe it is impossible for them to completely 'dissapear' into their movie characters in the eyes of the audience. Their celebrity is too bright by association. And more so, I don't believe they are even truly intended to fully disappear into the movie, in the mind of the director, in their own minds (at least subconsciously, regardless of what they say in interview), and, relevantly here, in the minds o the audience ourselves. We get something out of seeing a famous person on screen, and it's not their raw acting ability as we classily describe it. It's not how good they can 'play the character.' We go to see them exercise an element of themselves. They ring a bell in the culture, and it stirs something in us.\n\nThat brings me to the 'special story' movie celebrity. Key Huy Quan. Michelle Yeoh. Their story of redemption in the eyes of the media of the past two months feels now impossible to separate for me in the consumption of the 'Everything' movie. I can't watch that movie again, and see Raymond's face, and not think of Key Huy Quan's golden globe acceptance speech. I can't unwatch the speech. I am now connecting the two inside my mind. And... it feels good, but is it art? Does it matter? Can I separate the art from the artist? Should I? Much of Hollywood production and the star engine is based on answering most of the previous questions with \"no.\" And now, we have this different sort of 'ringing the bell.' It's the 'uplifting artist' story. The 'redemption arc' story. The 'racial representation' story. I've not yet seen The Whale and I know already that - should I do go and see it - I will be completely unable to separate my appreciation of that film with my youtube binging consumption of his tearful acceptance speeches. It's the 'Redemption arc' Brendan Fraser 'Whale' story. All mashed together in my head. Can I separate the stories? Should I? What if I enjoy the redemption arc Brendan Fraser story? What if it motivates me to see the film? What if it – in my own mind – increases my enjoyment of the film?\n\nAs social media expands, I see this sorts of micro-meta narrative mixing of art and artist – actor and movie – happening more and more. Whereas the only meta narrative in town used to be typically Hollywood star and Hollywood movie, the meta-narrative has expanded to cover new ground: where the viewer has watched tons of videos online of a particular actor and has formed an extensive inner concept of the actor in their mind before the lights go down in the theater. This can happen with TV actors'. There's the underdog meta-narrative, the Asian representation narrative, the LGBTQ representation narrative, the Nic Cage narrative, each of which have youtube channels, fan channels, access to all kinds of interview and public speaking content for all the actors we could possibly want, filling up our heads. \n\nBecause I wanted to see it in 3D, I went and saw Avatar (way of water) in the theaters. I was struck during two of the previews: one for Mission Impossible (how many is this one?) and Creed 3. Tellingly, both of these previews for top-billing Hollywood blockbusters chose to go 'meta' instead of the traditional route; The Mission Impossible trailer spent three minutes showing behind-the-scenes documentary coverage of Tom Cruise's crazy bike/cliff stunt. The Creed 3 trailer spent most of it's runtime showing documentary-style interviews of the actor/director explaining the philosophy behind the movie and what he was hoping to get across in his dual role. Both of them put the actors - Tom Cruise and Michael B. Jordan – and their processes, their philosophies, their true-to-life personalities as people - front and center in their advertisement of the movie, rather than a trailer depicting the actual plot, action, and on-screen characters of the movie that one would conceivably (I guess not anymore) be the draw.\n\nIt feels odd.\n\nI don't have anything else to say, this is long enough, I just wanted to write that out and post it.",

        "text": "Hi guys!\n\nAs I am digging more and more into world cinema, I would say I have arrived at a pretty good understanding of European art cinema. Although there are big cultural and artistic differences between countries and directors it is pretty easy to recognize some recurring patterns and themes. And the distinction between American and European cinema is of course the first to be joked about when talking about art house vs Hollywood stereotypes.\n\nHowever I have only scratched the surface of the third big player, Asian cinema (African and more will be investigated further for sure!). But I have a hard time pinning these movies down. So far I would say that they have very humanistic themes and a lot clearer and on-the-nose messages. But! Maybe that’s just the films I have seen so far.\n\nSo I was wondering if anyone here could give me some basic informations about Asian art cinema, old as new. What are some characteristics and recurring themes?\nI would love if someone could do a comparison of Asian and European art films!\n\nThanks in advance:)",
