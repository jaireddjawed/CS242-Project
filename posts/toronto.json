The \/r\/Toronto monthly meetup will be this Saturday, March 11.\n\nCome drink, eat, and hang out with us on the second floor of The Artful Dodger at 7 p.m. The Artful Dodger is located a short walk from Bloor-Yonge station, at 10 Isabella St.\n\nWe keep a close eye on the post comments leading up to and throughout the event. So drop us a line here if you have any questions!\n\nIf you've never been to an \/r\/Toronto meetup, don't worry about not fitting in. There are a few of us who come out regularly and will certainly welcome you. If you've joined us in February you're very likely to see some of the same people you met last month!\n\nThe Artful Dodger has been hosting our meetups for over 8 years now. It's not mandatory, but if you are able, we would appreciate it if you could support The Dodger by ordering food and drinks, which are quite affordable compared to other pubs (especially chain pubs).\n\nWe are also exploring ways to notify people when the meetup is happening (without doxxing). Please let us know in the comments if you are interested in getting reminders about the meetup!\n\nCan't wait to see you there!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**New to the meetups?

Here is the [**petition**](https:\/\/actionnetwork.org\/petitions\/sign-the-petition-to-make-high-park-car-free) and [**email campaign**](https:\/\/actionnetwork.org\/letters\/send-an-email-to-make-high-park-car-free). \n\nFirst, some background: the city's High Park Movement Strategy started a study of High Park back in 2021 to \"improve mobility within the park, while prioritizing safety, accessibility and the park\u2019s ecological integrity.\" A large portion of the study looked at the car-free weekends and the [results](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/torontobiking\/comments\/10g1sfg\/results_are_in_for_the_high_park_movement\/) were overwhelmingly positive!\n\nIt seemed like a slam dunk decision to finally make High Park car-free, as Central Park in NYC did back in 2018. That is until the emerging direction of the High Park Movement Strategy was shared, and it was revealed that they are looking to implement a variation of Strategy 3 instead of the incredibly popular car-free Strategy 1 (which was the runaway winner, including among the majority of families with young children and park users with disabilities). You can learn more about the 4 strategies [here](https:\/\/www.toronto.ca\/city-government\/planning-development\/construction-new-facilities\/parks-facility-plans-strategies\/high-park-movement-strategy\/). Not only that, but instead of expanding on the car-free weekends, they are considering eliminating them altogether.\n\nSo...\n\n* Despite the fact High Park is jam-packed on weekends and busier than ever\n* Despite the fact **75% agree that the road closures have had a positive impact** vs only 13% disagreeing\n* Despite the fact highest priority was placed on \"reducing the amount of motor vehicle traffic within the park\" and lowest priorities placed on \"offering direct vehicular access to interior park destinations\" and \"maintaining car parking within the park\"\n* Despite the fact families\u00a0with young children, park users with disabilities, and seniors\u00a0**all**\u00a0ranked \"offering direct vehicular access to interior park destinations\" as their lowest priority out of 13! possible options\n* Despite the fact 44% strongly supported Strategy\u00a01 (car-free) compared to only 12% strongly supporting Strategy 3\n* Despite the fact that Strategy 3 has more people in total opposing it (42%) than it has actually supporting it (37%)\n* Despite the fact that people felt most strongly that **Strategy 1 (car-free) would meet the High Park Movement Strategy goals by making the park safer, more accessible, and improving the park's natural environment** (Strategy 3 for comparison came in 3rd out of only 4 possible options)\n\nDespite all of this overwhelming evidence and feedback, which they themselves took great time and effort to gather through a number of engagements from nearly 20,000 respondents over the course of 2 years, the city is leaning towards a strategy that has more people in total opposing it than it has actually supporting it. Meanwhile, a car-free High Park, which was the runaway winning strategy during this whole exercise and would actually meet the High Park Movement Strategy goals of \"prioritizing safety, accessibility and the park\u2019s ecological integrity,\" would be eliminated altogether instead of being expanded on.\n\nThat is why the Car Free High Park Coalition is sending this letter to the City of Toronto re: The High Park Movement Strategy and the future of High Park.

While it would \\*technically\\* permit multiplexes in Neighbourhoods, it currently includes a 10 metre height restriction (ideally this would be a least 13 metres), setback requirements, and (most importantly) a very restrictive Floor Space Index that would render them effectively impossible to build in massive parts of the City. \n\nThe **Floor Space Index**, for those who don't know, is basically the ratio between the total floor area of a building to the total size of a lot. Some parts of Toronto require FSIs as low as 0.6, which simply makes it impossible to build a fourplex that also meets all the other requirements from the City. At the first public forum held yesterday, attendees were overwhelmingly upset with this in particular. If you want to actually build multiplexes, the FSI limit for them should at least be 2.0 citywide. \n\nIn general, it is very clear that this proposal is focused more on not offending NIMBYs than it is actually getting multiplexes built in the city. \n\nMore Neighbours Toronto, who are probably the biggest YIMBY group in the City, [put together a very good summary](https:\/\/www.moreneighbours.ca\/news\/analysis\/making-sense-of-the-multiplex-proposal-1) of the proposal - alongside their suggestions on what needs to change. \n\nYou can sign up for the public forum [here](https:\/\/www.toronto.ca\/city-government\/planning-development\/planning-studies-initiatives\/multiplex-housing\/).","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1677082607.0},{"title":"Toronto Daily - Feb 23rd 2023","author":"thetorontobot","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/toronto\/comments\/119p7pf\/toronto_daily_feb_23rd_2023\/","text":"#Welcome to the Toronto Daily Thread.\r\n\r\nThis thread serves two purposes:\r\n\r\n**1)** To collect and make visible new posts in smaller Toronto based subreddits.\r\n\r\nFeel free to visit, comment and be generally helpful in posts indexed below.
