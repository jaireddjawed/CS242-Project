No more. Time started when my mates got there at 6pm, even though I had only just got in a taxi. Had to order in the car, or we'd run out of time. \n\nDecent food, sure.\n\nThey were happy to sell us drinks at 7pm, pints all round, then we paid the bill and 5 minutes later they're directly asking us to \"move to the bar\" as someone else has the next slot... and given the apparent queue, there were no seats in their bar, so most of us ended up abandoning half full drinks... Don't sell drinks to people if you aren't going to give them time to enjoy them eh?\n\nIt's so much more brazen than it used to be, if there are no free tables, be realistic with waiting customers, don't turf people out to make space. Restaurants have been managing capacity pretty well for decades, knowing how long a table will \\*probably\\* be used for etc. But now they're allowed to openly tell you you've run out of time, and you're basically unwelcome, albeit with a smile.
