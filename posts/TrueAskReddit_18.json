        "text": "[This podcast episode](https://www.cjr.org/podcast/podcast-the-twitter-bot-economy.php) from CJR explores twitter bots and how they work. I began to wonder how I can avoid seeing tweets from those bots, and how Twitter might get rid of the bots.\n\nThe trick on both sides is how to tell bots from real people. Technically and procedurally, Twitter already has a mechanism in place to do that: verified accounts. And yes, in theory, anyone can apply to have their Twitter account verified. In practice, however, Twitter seems to only actually do this for accounts that are \"in the public interest\" and that are relatively active.\n\nBut imagine that Twitter would start taking this verification thing much more seriously: on the one hand, they'd have to allow anyone to verify their account, and to invest in making it hard to get a fake account verified. On the other hand, the Twitter app should suppress bot tweets by showing only tweets from verified accounts by default (to do that now, you need to know about, and manually apply, [a filter](https://socialmeditation.wordpress.com/2013/04/30/filter-twitter-searches-by-verified-users/)).\n\nWith these (admittedly expensive) safeguards in place, using Twitter as a propaganda tool would become much harder and much more expensive. The question is: what would Twitter's incentive be? I'd say severe damage to its brand, in response to some public outcry or other, that might do the trick. If only Twitter were currently in the middle of some big political upheaval over its undue influence in some kind of political process, like an election or something!\n\nWhat do you think? Can this problem be solved, and would this be the way to go?",

Even in a traditional life goal like follow the bible and live a life devoted to god; it tends to create a lot easier decision making, less wasted time and greater achievement of this goal and ultimately more happiness and satisfaction. \n\nSo do you think most people should try to conceive of a life goal or do you believe that maybe life is too complicated for a solitary goal? Do you believe it is not all that critically important?\n\nAlso, those of you who do have a life goal, what is it? ",

        "text": "Reading some different discussions on the DeepFakes issue and i have come to the conclusion that either side of the issue has very bad and consequential results in the long run. Ill start from the beginning with the disscusions. So the side that is more jovial and understandable is the disscusion of legal vs illegal. People seem to understand that if it becomes illegal it is a slippery slope to other forms of parody content being regulated as well. Which goes against the constitution as fair use (AKA parodies) falls under freedom of speech. But it being legal may go against another persons fundamental right to liberty if the AI generated content technology is misused. This one ive come up with a simple solution to which leaves no grey areas and that is that all AI generated content legally must be easily identified as fake by either having a watermark or a disclaimer to avoid missue. The main problem with it tho is that government entities and mainstream media could use this tech to brainwash a population which would create a very dim utopian society... This is where it gets tough because that alone makes me think it should be illegal but then again its the same as the gun debate. If it werd outlawed the only people who could use it is the cordupt and the dishonest.... On the other hand it being legal makes it easier for smaller media outlets to use to create fake interveiws and ect. Literally fabricating news which could possibly be used in such a way as to brainwash people..... Two solutions i can think of are 1. Abolish the internet. 2. Become anarcho capitalist causing the fake news to mean nothing because there is no power from anyone over anyone else everyone would be on the same level.... Any thoughts on this issue?",

        "text": "Millennials scoff at stories of the trials &amp; tribulations of the baby boomers, for whom grit played a disproportionately and perhaps unrealistically large role from the perspective of the former. \n\nThis clash of generations will only become worse because technology will create lives of infinite convenience — in light of advances in automation and medical science in particular. As I’m sure most of you are aware, universal basic income/negative taxation are frequent talking points for managing this transition (dubbed the fourth industrial revolution). The google ceo himself appraised the current state of ai as being a more critical turning point than the invention of fire or electricity.\n\nI don’t think utilizing future technology is a bad thing. In fact it will be far better for humans at every level/scale at which its impact is examined on society. And contrary to opinions of survivalists and those with less extreme opinions on that side of the political spectrum, I don’t think the consequences of technology, from lives of convenience to transhuman beings, amounts to mere crutches that will ‘spoil’ or disable us in the event of a regression, because of how unlikely a regression is. \n\nAgent smith was right in his iconic [dialogue](https://youtu.be/JrBdYmStZJ4) with Morpheus in *The Matrix* — in that generation after generation of suffering gets old and pathetic. There is more to life than infinite population and thus economic growth, and that is where we have to consider other ways to merit our lives than the ability to overcome mere hardship after hardship. A life of pleasure, art/creativity, philosophic discourse, or at least eudamonia is better than a game (that is our economic pyramid) where only a few can succeed in any sense of the word, and by any definition.\n\nIf you disagree with the possibility that things won’t go south after a new economic order, please explain as that would be a significant counterargument personally.",
