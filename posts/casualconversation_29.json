A few days after that I saw a man in a similar condition running on the street. Coincidence maybe, I thought. \n\n\n\nThen I had a dream where I was trying to climb a tree and kept falling off. The third of fourth time I fell from the tree, I woke up. The next day I went to visit a school friend for the first time since he moved to my city. Just as I reached his house, I saw a group of kids surrounding a tree, and where one boy kept trying to climb the tree but kept falling off after a certain point. Just like my dream! \n\n\nI'm experiencing similar incidents almost every alternate day now. The frequency has increased from once in two weeks to almost every alternate day. \n\n\n\nWhat is this and why is it happening to me? Is this black magic? Do I have black magic powers? I even had a dream where I was a stock broker and kept calling my clients to buy a stock, and the next day I checked and the stock was up 30%. \n\n\nHas anybody experienced sometime similar? If yes, please share your stories.",

Once I got home I noticed the oranges were mushy, bruised and just not in a good state. Instantly I knew what was happening. My loins were radioactive! The gamma rays from my nethers were irradiating my pant fruit. Like citrus in a coalmine, these soggy oranges were a harbinger of my demise. I had cancer and my these poor oranges proved it!\n\nAlas resigned to my faith I went through the 5 stages of grief and came to accept my death.\n\nAt that moment I woke up and was filled with renewed energy, joy and gratitude! Like a near death experience without the risk. All my stresses, concerns and dissatisfaction melted away and my whole world felt brighter, more hopeful. \n\nLife is beautiful and worth living. \n\nEverytime you're down think of oranges in your pants",

The manager didn't even explain why i didn't have to work there anymore she just straight up told me i dont have to come everyday, so i didnt even know, and so i didnt explain(not that it's gonna change anything but it will make me feel better)\nbut from what i remember i was speaking really loud enough, and i worked pretty fast. I even had lunch late all the time. I worked very hard but they say i didnt even try??? B hired me to work for her after this, but i dont like it because: i only do calls and say the same sentence multiple times, my only colleague is her since i work at her house, the work is draining bc theres no presenceof real people, i work longer and the salary is lower than A. I know i can find another job, but i have no experience(im a student waiting for university to start), almost all the jobs I can do involves little to no verbal interaction with people, which is something i need to experience more to improve on. Literally the only job that is perfect for me rn is A. I think it was unfair that i got rejected, i know the world is always unfair, but still i want a second chance. Is it ok to interview at A again and hopefully get hired? Or is it wrong/weird? Since they already hired a new part timer who is apparently better at the job.",

For a long time I was afraid to create unless I could do it \"right\" and my friend gave me the idea of creating something intentionally ugly. So I aimed to and ended up creating something I liked in an odd way. \n\nIt gave me this weird idea to just follow any artistic urge I wanted and test the waters with them. So I did just that. Eventually, I had a batch of about 100+ weird songs. Ranging from beautiful to \"wtf is this, it's literally just someone slamming on the piano\", to random spoken word journal entries over ambient backing.  The idea I had today was to finally bring other people into it. To try to make friends through it, and to open up my eyes to other weird ideas people might have.\n\nI've done everything from\n\n*  Literally just slamming on a piano\n* Using processing to sample images of my friend's face into audio form\n* Creating some really lovely ambient tracks\n* Auditory journal entries over different random tracks\n* Having two A.I bots chat over an A.I written chord progression\n\nToday I'm looking from ideas from you guys, though. Anything auditory goes (as long as it doesn't break copyright and/or other laws). If you want to tell a story for me to back with a piano track? I've gotchu. If you have some weird item that makes a neat sound in your house? I'll use it. If you just want to leave a creepy message for me to incorporate somehow? I'll be slightly concerned but I'll use it!   \n\n\nI'll likely only use 10 or so ideas so I can still have room to explore ideas of my own, but I'll gladly credit you and send you the link to the finished product :)\n\nI'm also down to hear from some other creative minds on here in general! \n\nHave you ever tried to do any 365-day experiments?\n\nFor musicians, have you ever explored making experimental/noise music?\n\nFor the people who aren't too creative, have you ever done any experiments of your own that seem adjacent just to see if you can?",

The employment agent(companyB) who recommended me explained it was because apparently i was slow and i talk too softly even though there's a lot of people, but from what i remember i was speaking really loud enough, and i worked pretty fast. B hired me to work for her after this, but i dont like it because: i only do calls and say the same sentence multiple times, my onky colleagues is her since i work at her house, the work is draining bc theres no presenceof real people, i work longer and the salary is lower than A. I know i can find another job, but i have no experience(im a student waiting for university to start), almost all the jobs I can do involves little to no verbal interaction with people, which is something i need to experience more to improve on. Literally the only job that is perfect for me rn is A. I think it was unfair that i got rejected, i know the world is always unfair, but still i want a second chance. Is it ok to interview at A again and hopefully get hired? Or is it wrong/weird? Since they already hired a new part timer who is apparently better at the job.",

Eh it’s something for someone like me who barely has any confidence in her looks. Btw I am not bashing my mom y’all. It’s just funny to see the amount of sass this woman holds. NGL it's goals.

        "text": "So I'm curious to know how much you are aware of ChatGPT or other types of AI on the Internet. There are AI's across the Internet that can generate advanced Art and answer practically anything you want. I used ChatGPT a few weeks ago and played chess with it, and... well... ChatGPT sucked at chess. But ChatGPT is not made for chess. It's made to answer most questions.\n\nSo I currently hold a B.S. in Comp. Engineering and I went through courses that I considered complicated. Programming exercises that seemed too challenging for me, especially in topics like Data Structure, programming in Assembly, or any Differential Equation exercise... These topics take a lot of work. And then there's ChatGPT. I uploaded a few problems I found online, and just like that, it solved it. Differential Equation is one of the most challenging topics in math, and ChatGPT solved a few DE problems like a walk in the park. It also solved a few Python and C++ problems I gave it. \n\nTo add more to this, just so you are aware, to hack a computer, you would need a network scanner (If using Kali or any Virtual Machine) and a few software you'd had to run to hack a victim. Softwares like a Network Scanner, Packet Sniffer, DNS Spoofer and so on... Well, I asked ChatGPT if it could build a Network Scanner and a Packet Sniffer in Python, and it did.\n\nThis honestly scared me. AI and Automation are slowly taking over. Programming jobs will become obsolete thanks to this. This applies to Retail, Many Engineering Branches, Tech jobs, Manufacturing, and so on... \n\nDon't get me wrong, we as humans can advance exponentially through AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. But at what cost? \n\nA Law called \"Moore's Law\" talks about Technological Singularity. This means that technology progresses exponentially. That's why over the last 100 years, most of the advances have come in the last few years. But soon, we will reach a point where we simply cannot keep up. \n\nAny thoughts on this? Do you view AI as a positive or negative thing?\n\nAny Opinion is welcomed.",

        "text": "So, let me tell you a story about my failed attempt to sell a grill. I thought I had the perfect marketing strategy to prove to potential buyers that this grill was worth their investment. I said I would make them lunch or dinner on the grill to show them how amazing it worked. But little did I know, this plan would backfire in the most hilarious way possible.\n\nI set up my grill on the front lawn, with a big sign that read \"Free Lunch or Dinner with the Purchase of this Grill!\" I thought it was a brilliant idea, who could resist the promise of a free meal? Apparently, everyone.\n\nPeople started to trickle in, drawn by the smell of sizzling meat and the prospect of a free meal. I happily grilled up steaks, burgers, and hot dogs for my guests, all the while extolling the virtues of my beloved grill. But as soon as the meal was over, they would say their goodbyes and walk away, without even considering buying the grill.\n\nI couldn't believe it! I mean, sure, I was a little hurt that no one wanted to buy the grill, but I couldn't blame them for wanting a free meal. Who doesn't love a good burger, am I right? So I decided to double down on my efforts.\n\nI started to make more elaborate meals, like roasted chicken and grilled vegetables. I even bought fancy cuts of meat and seafood to entice people. But still, no one was biting. I was getting frustrated, and my waistline was expanding. I mean, I had to eat all of that food too, right?\n\nAt one point, a guy who seemed genuinely interested in buying the grill came by. I was thrilled! I put on my best grill-master show, flipping burgers and tossing veggies with flair. I was sure this was it, I was finally going to make a sale. But after he finished his meal, he just said \"Thanks, that was delicious!\" and walked away.\n\nSo, if you're in the market for a grill, come on down! I'll grill you up a feast, and throw in a free meal plan too. Who knows, you might just end up taking home a great grill along with a new friend (who's really good at grilling).",

Last night we got into a fight because a joke about going back to being friends got a little out of hand. We both made big mistakes so I place no blame. Afterwards he sent me a paragraph about the things in our relationship he's been feeling uncomfortable about. Before that moment I had no discomfort or red flags that had caused me to want to break up. His paragraph ended with \"I don't want to break up, but there a quite a few things we should consider.\" I wrongly assumed that he broke up with me. He later explained it wasn't like that. Today we talked in person about the messages he sent me. He told me he wants me to decide if we should break up or try to make things work. I'm really hurt and unsure of what to do. I told him I needed space and I wanted a break, a week, to decide. What should I do? Should I try again? I feel very hurt, but I love him and only want the best for him.\n\nIf you have anything that might help me let me know.",

Kind of serious but mostly tongue and cheek he asked me to name 5 songs. \n\nI had seen a meme about the “millennial/gen x wearing a band shirt they can’t name a song from like The Rolling Stones” type thing. Wearing my Beatles shirt at the time, I thought I should prepare a response for the very unlikely chance I get asked. \n\nSo my coworker asked, and I said I’ll name 5 songs but you then have to name 5 different songs and he did, and I chose mostly more obscure Beatles songs like maxwells silver hammer, for the benefit of mr kite, rocky raccoon and 2 others. \n\nHe named 5 songs as well. Evidently he’s an old rocker and still has some guys he plays with. And then everyone clapped, jk. \n\nBut it was funny.

Another example, I don't generally cook cause my mom does it, and she's never taught me. I decided some days ago to make something to eat. They judged EVERYTHING I did. From my technique of making the dish to my movement and the ingredients I used. My older sister said something along the lines of \"Mammy what happen to (my name) I find she come out (idk if this sounds weird to you, but where I'm from we have a lot of slang.

I'm not allowed to drive until I've healed up a bit, so I can't go out unless someone drives me, and my husband is a teacher so he's gone all day. I can't really change my clothes or tie my shoes so I couldn't even go for a walk or workout today, and since I can't get the dressing wet, I couldn't shower after exercise either. I can't cook or do most of my usual chores around the house. I can barely use a computer - typing this post largely one-handed is taking forever. I work from home full time but there isn't much I can do for my job when using a computer is this challenging. I ended up spending most of today watching YouTube, napping, and eating way too much sugar.\n\nI've also struggled with depression my whole life and this isn't helping. (Before anyone asks, I'm on meds and see a therapist biweekly, I'm not in crisis.) I just feel very stuck and helpless. Mom's coming on Friday to help with a few things I can't do alone, but I'm on my own all day tomorrow until my husband gets home - and chances are he'll be out late.\n\nApologies for the rambling post, lol. Any suggestions of things I can reasonably do are more than welcome. Thanks in advance!",

I wish to conduct my Undergraduate Research Project under the supervision of Professor Klaus Kesler. I would like to invite monolingual and bilingual participants to assist in my experiment which aims to assess perspective-taking and belief judgement in these two groups. The experiment in question requires individuals who are either: Monolingual English speakers; or Bilingual speakers of English and one other language to participate. The experiment consists of answering questions on a simulation on screen. It takes around 20 minutes for a participant to complete the experiment.\n\nParticipants must: Be the age of 18 or above and speak either just English fluently or English and one other language fluently.\n\nOnly information about age, gender, and performance will be collected. Results will be made anonymous\n\nIf you are interested, please feel free to private message me for more information",

He's in my home state of Missouri in hospital, and I have been flying home nearly every weekend for the last few months. \n\nA \"guest\" came into the restaurant extremely upset because I hadn't responded to her email about planning her birthday. I apologized and tried to explain I was visiting my father in the ICU and wasn't responding to emails quite as quickly as usual. \n\nI said we could still accommodate her and I'd even give her a discount for the inconvenience. \n\nShe said this shouldn't matter as her dad was once hospitalized and it never affected her work performance. Her father who was also in attendance, said \"I get you're going through something or whatever but now I'm having doubts you'll be capable of planning my daughters special day\".\n\nI snapped back and said \"nothing, including his daughters birthday will ever take priority over my family.\" \n\nThey relayed my statement to my general manager who gravely apologized for my callous behavior and gave them a free bottle of wine and desserts on the house. I was reprimanded.\n\nI submitted my resignation that same night and my last day will be the 10th of March. \n\nI'm really struggling with the fact that I have so much to a company that thought so little of me. So let me hear it, give me your best quitting story!",

About halfway through I realize she’s copying my answers. I go ahead and fill out everything incorrect, and only changed my answers to the right ones in the final few seconds.

        "text": "I’m a super anxious, socially awkward person and I’ve been on my medication for almost 10 years now. It’s an anti-depressant but I’ve found I’m still incredibly depressed. They aren’t working the way they should. I don’t have a family doctor so I would have to go to a walk-in clinic. How do I talk to you he doctor about changing medication? Or how do I go about the conversation in general. I don’t know how to talk to people when it comes to my needs and I always rush any conversation to try to get out of it as fast as I can resulting in me not getting what I actually need. I guess all I’m asking is how do I go about even talking to them without feeling like I’m going to die from social anxiety or embarrassment? \nTIA",

I’ve been worried about the job market, my future, life generally and money, people not liking me etc. \n\nWhat happened recently was a lot of terrible things happened at once and I just cried for days. It was crazy sobbing and panic attacks etc. now I feel so damn stable. It’s the most stable I’ve felt in years. I have no real reaction to anything. Im calm in a way I’ve never been before.\n\nI have no anxiety or stress and I’m just completely calm. Even if something stressful happens I’m pretty calm.\n\nIt’s super weird!!!! Idk if the anxiety will come back but I feel it’s gone. I feel like I don’t have any more tears left.",
