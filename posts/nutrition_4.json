Best way is to try out supplements and see how you feel. \n\nI went to do a micronutrient blood analysis and found I have some things near the red areas. The doc then gave me a list of things to supplement and I asked if I couldn't achieve that by eating a more conscious plant-based diet with some meat every 10-15 days.\n\nHe said, because of the way our soils have changed and how we did agriculture in the last few centuries, the plants just don't provide enough nutrients anymore. Additionally, modern work- and lifestyles have higher demands than in the past, which requires higher nutrient intake. With this he concluded we need to supplement in any case.\n\nI was wondering if that is fair or true at all. \n\nAs I said in the title, I am not thinking about insufficiency, I am thinking about optimal intake.",

Now i’m cutting but I play volleyball in the spring so I’m nervous i’ll be doing too much cardio. I also started doing hot pilates to tone my core. I started my cut March 1st and today is March 6th and volleyball starts today. Rn I’m eating 2700 calories but should I increase it to account for the weight lifting, volleyball, and sometimes pilates?",

(source: WHO, McKinsey)**  \nAnd that a single of those imbalance can lead to unsuspected effect on your day to day life?   \nMy team at Biostarks is opening the pre-launch page of our new longevity biomarker test kit - a market premiere in at home self-testing with 35+ **essential micronutrients,** **hormones** , and **longevity markers** and markers of oxidative stress.\n\n[Here is the pre-launch page](https://biostarks.com/longevity/prelaunch?utm_source=Reddit&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_term=nutrition)\n\nThe story page might be a bit sassy - but we had to make it appeal to a larger audience beyond longevity/biohacking enthusiasts 👻 Sorry if this all sounds a bit commercial and bootstrapped at the same time, but we are more of a team of scientists and longevity enthusiasts than a big co with heavy marketing $. And the tracking is to better understand our audience.\n\nThere is 5+ years of R&amp;D behind the project. We have built a quite unique mass-spectrometry platform on which we already market our nutrition and sport test-kits (see [biostarks.com](http://biostarks.com/)), the later test-kit being used by several Ironman champions, Matt Fraser (5x world champion of Crossfit) and the OG. A lot was built around IP that was developed for the World Anti Doping Agency.\n\nWe have also built a digital companion around it and platform mostly aims towards helping user better understanding their metabolism baseline, what deficiencies they have and what type of health related impact they might induce, etc. We do make recommendations around diet but no upselling of supplements or so!\n\n[Please feel to register](https://biostarks.com/longevity/prelaunch?utm_source=Reddit&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_term=nutrition) if you are interested about the launch this mid-march, we will offer solid discounts in the first 48h of launch, or sharing is caring if you know anyone interested! 🙏\n\nAlso happy to engage on 1-1 basis for questions or here, looking to build the conversation with fellow nutrition aficionados or simply healthier lifespan enthusiasts!",

My issue then comes from sleeping-as I'm taking in all my food for the day during a four-hour window or so, all of that food obviously isn't going to completely digest before I go to bed, and what usually happens is a rough night of sleep involving multiple bouts of waking up thirsty and hot.  How do you all prevent this?  Do you simply give yourself several hours after eating before going to bed or is it different after taking in a day's worth of food over just a few hours?\n\nI'm not necessarily looking for any lectures about my process or how I should be treating my fasting window, unless it's relevant; I'm moreso looking for a way to make my current plan/situation work so I can sleep better.\n\nThank you!",
