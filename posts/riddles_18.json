I quickly ran to the girl's side and found out that she was dead.  After that, I saw a male student on the 5th floor looking at this place. I think the murderer should be him. \n\nThe police then arrested the male student. The student said:   \n\nI walking at upstairs that afternoon and suddenly heard screams, so I rushed over.  I found that the handrails on the 5th floor fell off.  So, I looked down and saw a girl lying on the floor. Then I saw that the teacher was looking at me too.  \n\n30 minutes later, police found a note inside the victim's drawer which wrote:  \n\nDo you want to know what happened to you? See you at the balcony at 5 pm.  \n\nPolice also found a broken eyeglass at the crime scene.  After comparison, this eyeglass prescription is much higher than the eyeglass in the victim's house.  \n\nAccording to her classmates, except for the class, she does not wear glasses.  According to the family, she had lost her memory, she goes to the 5th floor because of the note.  \n\nWho killed the victims, how did it kill? \n\nCan you guess the answer?  Try solve it before you see the answer!\n\nAnswer: [https://youtu.be/fStEhri1mnQ](https://youtu.be/fStEhri1mnQ)",

        "text": "\" **Scenario:** It was days since Nessie have invaded Scrapia, and the community were at peace. Although, Tony had a **GUT feeling** that something bad will be coming soon. Little did he know, that bad feeling came sooner than he expected! Screams were being heard at the fountain of mad milk, which is turning darker and darker.   \n\n\n**Tony:** I knew that something was coming... especially after that Nessie puzzler!  \nAfter a moment, the black substance that used to be mad milk was forming into a person. A black, slimy, and disgusting figure was formed, and **IT** shouted:  \n\n\n**IT:** WHO HERE HAS KILLED MY COMRADE?!  \nTony walk towards IT with a face of despise. He looks carefully at this figure, and noticed that the lips were covered in brown bubbling substance that he doesn't know what is it. The jacket had 20 boxes, but around 25% of them were empty.  \n\n\n**Tony:** It was me, Tony!  \n\n\n**IT:** HOW DARE YOU KILL MY COMRADE! YOU SHALL BE PUNISHED!!  \n\n\n**Tony:** I challenged him to a puzzle, and he lost. It is not like I fought him with a guns, bombs, or swords.  \nAs IT's head is slowly become more red, full of hatred and temper for losing his comrade, he thought of something that would truly be worth the attack.  \n\n\n**IT:** THEN TONY, I CHALLENGE YOU TO A PUZZLE! IF I WIN, THEN YOU WILL ALL GIVE ME YOUR SOULS!  \n\n\n**Tony:** I won't let you kill anyone!  \n\n\n**IT:** WHO SAID ANYTHING ABOUT KILLING?  \nIT teleported a saint, one of the kindest players in Scrapia, who always believed in the community, plunged his teeth onto her neck, and started to sucking her dry! While everyone thought she was losing her blood in panic, Tony noticed that she wasn't losing any blood!   \n\n\n**IT:** BLEH, BITTER TASTE! ANYWAYS TONY, WANT TO KNOW THE PUZZLE NOW? OR WANT ANOTHER EXAMPLE?! I COULD GO FOR SOMETHING MORE SWEETY!  \nTony thought hard about the matter, of why exactly did this THING bit the girl's neck, but no blood came out, but something DEFINITELY came out of her neck. He was a bit terrified of what exactly is \"sweet and bitter\" for this thing as he started at some scammer, but he had an idea...  \n\n\n**Tony:** I'm ready!  \n\n\n**IT:** WHAT IS SOMETHING SWEET FOR BRIGHT, AND WHAT IS SOMETHING BITTER FOR NIGHT?  \nTony thought of it very carefully for the matter, he looked at the poor saint holding a peace sign in a fragile state, and the scammer with a pleasure feeling as he watches the saint become weaker, as if she is slowly loser her will to believe in good.  \n\n\n**IT:** WELL?! DO YOU WANT TO PASS?!  \nThe moment he heard this, he immediately said:  \n\n\n**Tony:** Xxxx xxx Xxxxxxx! IT was starting to burn up in flames, and he shouted: ***\"CON..GRATU..LATION! YOU***\n\n***GRA..DUA..TED!\"*** A teddy bear that half of his body was white, and half was black, and it just disappeared after a moment. and Then. he got a phone call from someone he wouldn't expect.. An old friend.... \n\n**Format: So... What did Tony say?** \\*\\*Hints:\\*\\* 1) Dialogue of IT 2) Symbolism, find them (Maybe find important words and mentions in the story could help!) 3) This reminds you of something you MAY have wat\\[ched?\\]\"\n\nThe Xxxx xxx Xxxxxxx is the format of the answer. So what I know is that he answer is 3 words...\n\nA few failed answers that I've tried are: Cake and Cookies, Tart and Popsicle... I cant think of anything else!",

        "text": "(Don't forget your spoiler tags!)\n\nDetective Mista was in quite a conundrum. A 3rd Grade teacher, Mr. Zen, let his students out to lunch and recess. During this, Mr. Mista, who was acting as a guest speaker to teach the kids about occupations, came in the classroom to discuss with Mr Zen, but instead ended up discussing the knife in his back with the man on the other end of the 911 line. He couldn't participate in the investigation, but luckily, a friend of his, Mr. Parks was put on, and they relayed crime theories in their free time.\n\nDay 1.\n\nMista inquired, \"So what did the investigation turn up?\"\n\n\"We got some things,\" replied Parks, \"Starting with the victim, he was actually breaking dress code on the day of a crime.\"\n\n\"Do tell.\"\n\n\"He was wearing a shirt that exposed his shoulders, which is forbidden by 'schoolhouse law'. Additionally, in his left pocket we found a note saying 'Meet with Gerald at...'\"\n\n\"At ...?\"\n\n\"A bit of blood must've dripped down to his back pocket, cause the part with the time is too stained to read.\"\n\n\"Rats.\"\n\n\"We've al-\"\n\n\"Wait, just who is this Gerald character?\"\n\n\"School counseler and prime suspect. There were shoe tracks coming in and out of the victims room, and we found out Gerald's got mud on his shoes. No motive though, so there's room for doubt.\"\n\n\"So as it stands now, in between when the students left and when I found the body, which I believe is about a one hour period, there was a point in time in which the victim wasn't alone.\"\n\n\"Yup, and no proof of any other periods has been found. Anyway, we also found a crack in the victims window, and the area around it was a bit rough. Wasn't there before apparently, indicating there was a srtuggle between the victim and killer.\"\n\n\"Wait, when I found the body, he was sitting in his chair. What kind of struggle ends in a chair?\"\n\n\"We think the body was moved. Can't be 100 percent sure, though. There was also a music player in his room. Used to play songs for the kids, and when they're not there, songs for himself. It was paused on John Quer's 'Winter in July'.\"\n\n\"How do ya know?\"\n\n\"I hit play. Shame too, he must've had some dang good tastes.\"\n\nDay 2.\n\n\"Alright some new stuff came up,\" Parks said, \"First up, we got that note analysed.\"\n\n\"So what was the time on it?\" asked Mista.\n\n\"Place, actually. It said, 'Meet with Gerald at the principal's office.'\"\n\n\"Clearly didn't do that.\" \n\n\"Yep, questioning confirmed it. There was also a security camera under the music player. Managed to get some footage.\"\n\n\"That's great! It could turn this case on it's head!\"\n\n\"Well, um... I've got a copy, let me just play it for you.\"\n\nParks inserts a DVD in his hand into Mista's home player.\n\n\"SLAM!\" goes a door on the TV.\n\n\"🎵That's the way things be nowadays,\" a voice on the TV sings.\n\n\"Gerald, sometimes you can be such a-\" the victim seems to say.\n\n\"🎵IIIIIIIIT'S WINTER, IN, JULYYYYYYYYYYYYY! Thaaaat's whyyyyyyyy...🎵\" another voice sings.\n\nAfter a while, the door yet again goes, \"SLAM!\" It is barely heard through the singing.\"\n\nThe DVD cuts out there.\n\n\"Y-You can't even see anything!\" Mista blurts out.\n\nParks replies, \"Some rascal put a Post-It on it. Plus, it seems like the only noise that isn't drowned out by the unusually loud music, is Grealds unreasonably loud usage of doors.\"\n\n\"So we should still can't confirm  or deny a struggle occuring. Why'd the tape just end?\"\n\n\"Not entirely sure. Either way, it's all we have. Last thing, we managed to find out that the victim died instantly from his wound.\"\n\n\"Thank you for sharing!\"\n\nParks proceeds to leave.\n\nAn hour later, Parks gets a call. On the other end is Mista, and he seems to have figured something out.\n\nWhat did he find?\n\n\n",

It's a Sith legend told to our youngest acolytes. \n  \nDarth Pestis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, who one day happened across an ancient Sith power in a long lost tomb on Korriban.  It would have been his if he could only answer the Ravager's Riddle correctly, but he could not.  The apparition spoke it to him the moment he entered the chamber:\n\n\"Answer my question correctly, and powers of the Force beyond your comprehension shall be yours.  Fail, and all power here shall be lost....... \n  \n**During three years of peace,**\n\n**a passionate counsel of six conspired,**\n\n**to gain the combined strength,**\n\n**that was truly required.**\n  \n**The power, raised by just three, they did eventually obtain,**\n\n**then split it across three Empires who would jointly reign,**\n  \n**Yet to gain true victory,**\n**to break each chain,**\n\n**speak the number aloud that shall be allowed to remain.**\"\n  \nPestis thought for a while, then spoke his answer loudly, confidently..... Then he was instantly cut off from the Force, his power and the ancient power leaving Korriban forever.  He was killed by his Master after returning to him with the tale.\n  \nThis, my young apprentice, is why you should learn your lessons well.  \n  \nWhat was the answer Pestis gave?  What was the proper answer, and why?\n\nEdit:.

It's a place so honest that the villagers don't even understand the concept of a lie and trust implicitly everything they're ever told. There are few visitors, and all who do happen by are trusted in their every utterance. The village suffers from one, and only one, minor problem: three of its citizens have B.O..\n\nEvery villager in Bodourville is too polite to inform another villager of his or her miasmic condition, or even to discuss it with other, non-offending villagers. Everyone in Bodourville is also so polite that when someone realizes that he or she has B.O. he or she makes the voyage to the lake at the top of the mountain at the dawn of the very next morning to bathe and returns to his or her shady abode well before noon, ridding him- or herself of the affliction for weeks to come, as the villagers of Bodourville have a very relaxed lifestyle, a cool climate, and a genetic disposition to being very scent-free. But just like normal people, the villagers are unable to smell their own body odour in the unlikely event that they do have any.\n\nOne afternoon, a visitor arrives and, as all visitors are required to do, makes a brief address to the entire village at the daily congregation in the town hall where all inhabitants interact with, and smell if they can, every other villager. The visitor departs later that day. Three mornings later, at dawn, the three citizens with B.O. set out to the top of the mountain to bathe. Upon their return, all is right again in Bodourville.\n\nWhat does the visitor tell them?",
