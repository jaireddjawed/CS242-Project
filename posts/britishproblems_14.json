        "text": "So I was served this cake at an informal gathering recently. I originally thought that it might be from the Italian Genoa which is the Italian word for the city Genoa and is the origin of said cake originating from the sweet Christmas cake of the  16th Century called pandolce.\n\nApparently the modern vernacular of the British Genoa cake is just a repository for any left over scraps from the kitchen, an abundance of raising, orange peel and any other leftover things are thrown into this so called cake. The British Genoa cake adheres to no tradition or rituals of any kind and seems to just loosely borrow its form from an ancient Italian cake of the same name, the British version has sullied this simple and elegant Italian classic to include any leftover things that one might find in the kitchen or pantry.\n\nGenoa cake is an absolute abomination and I would vote it perhaps the worst British cake in existence, it is literally just a conglomeration of all of the leftover scraps and bits and bobs that might have been used in other more worthy bakery projects.",

His inflection and everything about how he said this lead me to think that he was disrespecting me, so I cut him off and told him to leave me alone.

        "text": "I saw a post earlier on someone coming into the office with the Flu and it really got me frustrated at the state we find ourselves in when it comes to companies snubbing WFH and the general direction it's heading.\n\nTry as we might to forget and it often seemed like some weird twisted groundhog-day-esque dream, the early days of 2010 had us all scrambling around on video calls with our managers and teams about how to enact some remote contingency to our current working lives.\n\nAnd in a sick, perverted state of mind, I welcomed it with open arms.\n\nFor years prior to 2010, I'd led a campaign for a public sector company (that one in London that does all those things with tubes and ULEZ zones...). It was called 'Smart Working'. It was a rollout of many different things. BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) to allow for work emails etc on your own devices. Flexible working requests, but also, Working from Home. It was a concept that was considered equally-if-not-more productive than time in the office and was taking off in a lot of departments.\n\nSadly, it didn't take off in my department. Why? My boss (we'll call him Mr X) hated it. I remember being in a managers meeting, with other managers in my department and he stated he \"Didn't trust people at home to do the work required, if he wasn't there to see them\".\n\nFast forward two years and we know what happened. I'd left said London for Transport company prior to this, but I remember speaking with ex-colleagues who worked for Mr X during *those* two years. They hated it. He didn't like the fact he couldn't see his colleagues doing work and attributed *any* mistake, to not being in the office. Then would just take pot-shots at people he thought weren't pulling their weight, based on nothing more than intuition. He'd monitor Teams statuses and ask where they were if they were inactive after 10 minutes. Pure hell.\n\nSo I had a takeaway from this. When I led the Smart Working program, it was important to stress about measures. Measures are an easy way to ensure work is being done, without looming over people. Measures should be in place anyways, regardless of where one is working. So I decided to make sure my staff would understand their goals and when they were required. That a rather vague description of it, but it just gives managers confidence in how work is coming along. It's monitorable.\n\nNow, I'm a **BIG** advocate for WFH. I see no reason why jobs can't be 90% or more WFH for all office based employees. I tell my staff, in any job, I don't care where you do your work from, as long as it's done and on time. And that's not coming from a place of dictatorship. It's one of flexibility and understanding. You're paid for your experience and level of productivity. In my eyes, you're not paid to be paraded around the office like a show pony, for something that adds no level of productivity.\n\nI won't hire someone in a full-time position, when I know they don't have enough work to fill their full-time capacity either. I draw back to my days at London for ULEZ. Far too many people were hired in many a department, for no more than possible cover during holidays. This meant, you have umpteen FTE's, with ~~nothing to do~~ lots of spare time. Now, as a manager, you could possibly understand Mr X's position, worried that his staff were just being paid to sit idly by at home. Hard analysis of your department and what they do, would realise you only need 3 FTE's, not 6. That's another key aspect of the WFH puzzle.\n\nBut I digress. The problem we have nowadays, is that people are starting to get the announcement of more and more days required back in the office. Not learning a thing from the last two years.\n\nAnd why? Because for every Mr X in the world, you know there's thousands more. All with this archaic mindset that when they can't see their staff, they immediately jump to the assumption that their staff are sitting on their fat lazy arses, playing a game of \"let's see if I can get this peanut in my belly button\". \n\nIt makes me sick that this stigma of WFH hasn't been eradicated, unless you're a software developer where it's considered the norm. We've had people had their salaries reduced in companies where they wish to work from home full-time. Why? By that reckoning, do you pay more for people who commute further? \n\nWe still sit in Teams meetings when we're in the office. So the 'cohesion' route is just patter for senior management to make themselves feel good. All for what? To show our face? To take part in elevensies? We all work less when we're in the office, because we spend circa 2 hours commuting and half the time listening to Sophie's date last night, or how Linda's kids are doing at f-ing swimming lessons. Is it good for our mental wellbeing? Probably. Is it good for productivity. Probably not.\n\nPresenteeism then rears it's ugly head again. We have those who feel so guilty about taking a day off sick, they decide to spread their nasty disease around the office, all because Mr Senior Manager wants to see bums on seats.\n\nAll this, in the last year and I've yet to hear sound reasoning or see a graph that shows me \"Time in Office vs Productivity Output\" and a big upward trend....",

I even paid extra for \"signed for\", just didn't pay for enhanced compensation which screwed me over in the end. \n\nThe worst part is, I dropped these off in the parcel shop, and the tracking status literally stops there. There was never any updated tracking saying the courier has scanned and taken it out for delivery, Just gone from their system. I could even understand if it got lost in a van somewhere, but literally 0 recorded updates after it was dropped off? Evri are completely incompetent and I assume someone during the process just stole them.\n\nYes i did frustratingly go back to the parcelshop and try snuff out if theft was possible or if they knew anything - they themselves say its got nothing to do with them, \"take it up with Evri my friend\". Ebay also direct the blame onto Evri and refuse to give any compensation. As I didn't purchase the enhanced compensation, Evri can only give £25 per shoe with loss claim, which is less than 10% of the actual price. Oh but at least they are refunding the postage.\n\nOn the plus side, I sold another pair 2 days ago, used Royal Mail special delivery by 1pm which has £500 insurance. Packed, dropped off and delivered in 1 day. This was packaged the exact same way. I should've just used them in the first place.\n\nWhat an expensive life lesson. This guys are the worst.",

It would be a bit obvious when they count and see an indent of where you did vote.\n\nPlus, why would they bother going through all that when they could just throw your vote away and fill in a blank one?",

So either the Evri driver is a lazy liar, or they have invisible vans driven by blind drivers who can't see the two occupants of the house in the windows.  Which do you think Evri will claim?",

How about you?” \n\nI know it’s just politeness but it’s just so repetitive. Worst one is when you speak to the same person half an hour later and they ask you again. Yeah I’m the same as I was half an hour ago. Bit hungrier then I was but nearly lunch time.\n\nI’m a millennial, you’re lucky I’m answering the phone in the first place, so just tell me what you want and we can hang up and get back to our busy lives. Many thanks 🤦🏻‍♂️😂",
