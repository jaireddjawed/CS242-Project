        "text": "To glaze over the background information: the party has finally found the lair of the BBEG Wizard, but a trick by the wizard has trapped three characters in a cage with an Antimagic Field--A Summoner, A Magus, and a Fighter.\n\nThe Fighter unfortunately has a magic-powered heart which immediately fails and he quickly dies of cardiac arrest.\n\nThe BBEG Wizard comes in. The two remaining party members in the cage are both fairly impotent without magic, so discussion between party and Wizard commences for a while, as he performs the standard expository monologue. \n\nHe explains his master plan is already in progress. Regardless of whether we agree with his plan, we are too late to stop it.\n\nIt's about this time that the Magus pulls out his whip. A weapon he used so rarely we all had forgotten he'd dumped several feats into specializing in it.\n\nSpecifically, he is able to grapple people with it.\n\nBefore anyone realizes what is happening he's lashed out of the cage with the whip and grappled the Wizard who stands about 15 feet away. He starts to pull the Wizard, who frantically tries to loose himself, but fails--in seconds he is pulled up against the bars of the cage...\n\n...within the Antimagic Field.\n\nThe Magus pins him against the bars by wrapping the whip around him and begins to strangle him. The Wizard frantically struggles, but his frail body is no match for the Magus' strength and martial training. The Summoner jumps in and helps tie the Wizard to the bars with some more rope, and then, in a fit of rage he reaches through the bars and begins to ineptly stab the Wizard with a crossbow bolt.\n\nThe results are brutal and inefficient.\n\nBleeding and gasping for air, the Wizard struggles on in vain, round after round he fails to escape and slowly succumbs to his torturous death. His magical contingency that should have saved him in just such a life-threatening situation goes off...but fails because of the Antimagic Field.\n\nThe Magus finishes the job by drawing his revolver and firing point blank into the Wizard's back several times. The Wizard slumps against the bars, dead. \n\nThey step back, having defeated their foe, but still trapped in the cage. All they can do now is hope that their friends outside can find them in time to reverse the dead wizard's plans...",

        "text": "So, yesterday I played Aberrant the first time with my brother (also a newbie), my best friend, and his two friends, one of which was GMing. Important to know this was set in an alternate World War-less 1940s Austria.\n\nMy brother played Ferrus, a magneto-type manipulator, my best friend was Lilith, a french succubus supermodel (maxed out appearance with empathic manipulation and quantum vampire), his friend was Cannon, an armoured artillery guy who shoots biospikes and I opted for Lykaon, a physical-focused animal master with claws heightened senses and a fondness for wolves.\n\nNow, we had already thwarted a train robbery, Lykaon personally killing six of the nine bandits, and infiltrated a military base for information on an incoming convoy, and from those missions it was clear we were a dysfunctional group. Cannon already hated Lykaon, having a military background, disliking Lykaon's feral fighting style and Cannon having a protective fondness for Lilith whereas Lykaon expressing outright lust (Lilith expressed the same but nothing came of it).\n\nNow, knowing the weapons convoy we had to sabotage was headed through a forest, and as Lykaon's pet dire wolves had both been shot in the train robbery, they had to be left in town with a vet. So instead, with a day to spare, Lykaon travelled the forest gathering an army of wolves, stags, bears, squirrels and birds to his command to use as a main attacking force, the rest of the group agreeing to meet later. Felling a tree into the road with his bare hands he awaited the rest who had prepared with disguises and weapons of their own.\n\nThe group arrives, the army ready, and the convoy...was nowhere to be seen. A day passes and the animals are about to eat each other, when a jeep in the opposite direction approaches the blockade. Being warned ahead of time and panicking, Lykaon sent the stags to hustle about the road further down with him nearby in the bushes coaxing them into not running from the jeep. The jeep slows to a stop in front of the deer, honks...honks again...honks a third time and fires a pistol into the air. The deer don't move. Reenacting the Family Guy scene of Peter backing out of his driveway, blocked by a brain-damaged horse, the jeep begins nudging the deer trying to scare them off. Nothing. Finally the soldiers give up and try to drive around them, Lykaon orders them to attack. The soldiers are baffled by it but unhurt, they shoot one stag and the rest scattered and they zoom past towards the blockade. Lykaon sends a swarm of birds but the car's too fast. The jeep zooms towards the blockade and Ferrus uses his magnetism to flip into to a lethal crash. The party is now on edge, worried that the convoy was meant to meet further along the road and that their intel was bad.\n\nSure enough though, a day later and a fancy car followed by a large truck meet the blockade. Everyone in position, but due to the wait the animals had to be recalled so there was a delay. After a few moments of confused soldiers trying to move the tree the party attacks. Lykaon throws a sapling into one guard and gets shot at, resisting a full-on injury from his first bullet wound; Cannon smashes the fancy car and is protected by his armour by the driver's pistol. Ferrus magnetizes the truck and car together and open fires with five floating tommy guns. The Novas hold down the soldiers until the swarm of animals attack, the soldiers fleeing into their truck and barricading it.\n\nFerrus kills the two in the cab by barraging it with bullets, but then the passenger from the fancy car emerges and cuts down a bear (just below us in power) in a moment with his sword. His face was hidden and when Lykaon gave him a good clawing to the chest no blood seemed to be drawn so the party referred to him as Mecha-Hitler. However, Lykaon's claws had weakened him enough for a biospike-to-the-head to kill him.\n\nNow we had four soldiers firing out the back of the truck anytime animals tried to enter. Lilith forced them to feel bravery in hopes it would send them out but instead Lykaon could hear them opening up the weapons crates. Lykaon figured the best answer was to flip the truck, and called the remaining two bears and Cannon to help.\n\nBut Cannon refused. He said he did not want to get close to the truck while they were pulling out weapons, and was afraid it would flip and explode and kill them all. Lykaon called him a coward and berated him for being the more cautious despite having natural armor. Lykaon proceeded with just the two bears and failed the roll with 5 successes, requiring 6. The truck wobbled and almost tipped but then a soldier poked his head out and blew off the head of one of the bears with an anti-tank rifle. Lykaon, now furious with Cannon, ran around the other side of the truck and told the animals to disperse. Ferrus used his powers to disable the powerful gun, and three soldiers piled out, one with the broken rifle, another with a working one and the last with a flamethrower. The working rifle hit Cannon and injured him, the other just clicked and Lykaon merely leapt over the flames to dodge them completely.\n\nThe fourth soldier fiddled with a bomb inside and its countdown became audible. All of us fled and made the saves to get away in time, unlike the soldiers. The job was done, but with the character flaw Vengeful, Lykaon was not appeased. He collected his share of the money, patched himself and his wolves up and left the group permanently, not only because of Cannon, who had it out for him, but also because the other two refused to take his side or help.",

        "text": "So, this is a tale all about how even if you play a Mary Sue chaos marine, doesn't give you the right to be a massive cockbag.\n\nThe cast.\n\nXurden: Night Lord, has managed to stay unaligned thus far, also a total bro.\n\nHermesaalon: Thousand Sons sorcerer, obsessed with tzeentch, is constantly cleaning his armor.\n\nCarl: The imaginatively named world eater berserker of khorne. Current party meme is either \"SHUT THE FUCK UP CARL/ WARP FUCKING DAMMIT CARL. Our parties loveable idiot, lowest INT score I've ever seen on a space marine.\n\nXandamion: Word Bearer priest. Also a total jackass in game and irl.\n\nArch Magos Koriel: My character,Heretek healer and artificer, follower of Nurgle, master artificer, and chirurgeon. Only non chaos marine in the party.\n\n\nSo  our tale takes place just after our ship was boarded by loyalist ultramarines.\n\nThe main boarding squad was dead, our night lord and berserker were off hunting down the survivors of the other squad.\n\nXandamion is bleeding out on the deck where he talked a lot of shit and got his asshole rocked by an ultramarine sergeant. \n\nHermessalon or \"the herm\" is using his powers to help root out the survivors, his rubric marines are standing guard for me while I work on our resident priest.\n\nSo, in the past xandamion was usually a dick to everyone. We knew he would betray us. But then again it's black crusade and that shit is encouraged.\n\nSo with him in negative hp, and bleeding onto the deck I go to work.\n\nNow irl the entire time his player is bitching about the dm making the ultramarines sergeant too powerful (despite the rng gods hating him and his lack of imagination in combat) \n\nBeing tired of his bitching like the rest of the party, I decide to fix this. Normally being a master chirurgeon it wouldn't be too awfully difficult to patch up a few chain sword and bolter wounds.\n\nSo instead of healing him, I promptly use my bonesaw to cut his fucking head off.\n\nNow I did this through notes with the dm. So while the rest of the party is hunting, the sorcerer is distracted, the only people who saw me do it was the rubric marines, and being soulless robots, they ain't gonna say shit.\n\nI harvest his progenoids, and a few other organs that I wanted and left him.\n\nNow, when the dm lets him know that he has been very much so dismembered, and he promptly lost his shit.\n\nDm's response \"it's black crusade, it would be weird if you guys didn't try to kill each other from time to time, you just lost out.\"\n\nSo afterward while the other party members are scavenging his armor for parts, Carl rips an arm off of the corpse and tapes it to the head of one of the rubric marines with the statement \" look! He's a real boy now!\"\n\nCue Carl being berated by the sorcerer for doing things to the rubric marines again.\n\n\nOh that Carl...\n\n",

        "text": "Not my story; all credit to /u/LegionofMisfits at their post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/3363gu/the_most_surreal_experience_ive_ever_had_in_skyrim/).\n\n___\n\nI was making a journey North to kill a dragon at Mount Anthor. I'm playing a mixed restoration / alteration archer / witchhunter type character with Frostfall, No HUD, RN&amp;D, Hunterborn and a few other mods to aid in the immersion.\n\nIt seemed perfectly normal. I collected as much food and drink as I could carry and set out from the Nightgate Inn through an old mountain trail called Wayward Pass (which is a really cool location, if you ever want to check it out). Along the way I passed a couple of wolves that ignored me and I was just about to the summit of the pass when a blizzard hit.\n\nNow when I say blizzard, I don't mean that there were a bunch of snow effects blowing across my screen. I mean 0-visibility, my cloak and padded clothing did nothing and my body temperature plummeted. I pulled off to the side of the trail and found a level spot to pitch my tent. I had brought along enough firewood to create a sizable fire, despite the wind and cold, and I sat in my tent and downed some of my food while I waited for the storm to subside.\n\nI waited for two days. The wind and snow didn't let up. I knew that if I tried to head back down the mountain to the Nightgate, I'd likely freeze to death. Worse, if I encountered any sort of enemy along the way, my borderline-hypothermic state would make me easy prey. Going up the mountain wasn't an option either, so I just waited.\n\nDuring that time, I exhausted nearly all my food and water reserves. I had 1 serving of water left in my skin, and bout 3 pieces of salted meat in my pack by the time the storm let up. I had no wood to light another fire, should the need arise, and I figured it was best to simply forge on through the pass before the weather took a turn for the worst again.\n\nLuckily, I made it to the summit and began the trek down the other side without too much incident. And that's when it happened. I heard hooves clopping on snow and thanked Talos for sending a pair of elk my way. I crouched and saw them before they saw me: a buck and a doe coming straight my way.\n\nI got off to the side of the trail and readied my bow, and as the buck ran past I shot it. I couldn't believe my luck. I'd have fresh meat enough to keep me going until I could reach Mount Anthor and back, hopefully. I almost shot the doe as well when something that I have not seen in 900+ hours of playing happened.\n\nThe doe stopped and instead of running from the crazy, pelt-wearing white guy with a bow, it just looked at the dead buck. And then it bugled. If you've never heard an elk bugle, look it up. It's a sad - almost creepy - sound by itself. And here was this female elk looking at what I realize in retrospect was likely its mate and doing the elk equivalent of mourning.\nThen it looked at me and bugled again. Didn't run. Didn't attack. Just took turns between bugling at me and its dead partner. I had never seen this before, and I was understandably taken aback.\n\nI stood there for a good 45 seconds, slowly but surely freezing to death as I watched this scene. And then I did something I never do. I broke my cardinal rule and booted up console, selected the elk and typed \"resurrect.\" The buck jumped up and together with the doe, they both ran up the mountain back the way I came.\n\nThose two elk made me feel real emotion in a fucking Fantasy RPG. And for that, I couldn't just keep walking. Enjoy your lives, you beautiful, majestic bastards.",

Titus lowered his visor and drew his sword. The archer took refuge behind a sack of grain. Grethor readied his staff and Omega drew his sword. Titus slowly raised his shield and edged forwards. \"Who goes there!\" he shouted at the source of the noise that disturbed the party. Omega and Grethor stood against the wall in the ruins they were searching. Grethor motioned a finger to his lips for silence. Omega nodded and gripped his sword tighter.\n\nThe knight stood his ground as a small girl walked out from a hut, it's roof burned and battered. She looked at the knight, rags clung to the girl like they were sewn to her skin and her boots were torn at the seams. She clung to an old book that was almost her size. The knight kept his weapon and shield raised. He had seen many a sorcerer use spells to their advantage and their tomes were often a source for dark and powerful magicks.\n\n\"Lower your tome and speak child!\" The knight ordered. The archer watched over the sack of grain, her bow ready for any action that could cause havoc for the party. Omega watched silently.\n\nThe child shook her head. \"I... I can't let go of it sir.\" she replied. \"If I do then he will hurt you.\" she shook with fear, whatever \"he\" was it had caused the child great pain and suffering the knight thought to himself.\n\n\"Child, we can help but we need to know what it is that will hurt us.\" The knight slid his sword over his shield. As he did Grethor nodded to Omega and they slowly moved around the ruin. The child darted her eyes from the knight to the other two adventurers moving from the ruin. She looked to Omega and panicked, \"Oh no.\" she cried. \"Another one!\" She stepped back and nearly stumbled. \"You're here to take the tome aren't you! You want him to come back!\"\n\nThe party slowly stepped towards the girl. Omega looked confused, \"Grethor. Another Omega?\" He asked the wizard.\nGrethor scratched his beard. \"Lower your guard lads. This isn't gonna need weapons.\" he reasoned. \"Child we're not gonna hurt you. Omega is a friend of ours.\" He crouched so he was around the same height of the child. \"What's troubling you lass?\"\n\nThe child seemed to calm. \"He... He's not like him?\" she asked nervously.\nGrethor tugged at his beard again, \"Lass you're gonna have to tell us what Him is first.\" He pointed a finger at Omega. \"He is one of us. He just want's to see the world.\"\nOmega waved excitedly. \"Omega is he! Him is not Omega. Omega is friend because he is not him and him is not a friend because him wants to come back. Omega is here because he is not him and Omega isn't him because him isn't here!\" He smiled and looked at grethor for approval.\n\nGrethor looked  at Omega who seemed rather proud of what he had just said, \"Do you see how confusing this is now lass? What is it that scares you?\"\nThe girl slowly put the tome under her arm. \"My name is preeta.\" she began slowly. \"I used to live here before some bandits came and destroyed it all.\" At the mention of bad guys Omega looked around the forest, what if they came back? He thought to himself. \"My mother told me to run to the forest and find the north cave. I had seen it many times with my father so knew it was a safe place to run to. The bandits didn't chase me. They continued to kill everyone they could and burn the huts. Mother said she would find me when it was over. I hid there for the day, noone came to find me and it got cold and dark. I gathered some sticks from the mouth of the cave and made a torch. When I heard the bandits marching I hid deeper in the cave so they didn't see my torch.\" She paused and moved the tome to her other side carefully.\n\nThe wizard smiled, she had been alive for so long out of instinct not luck. \"You're a smart one lass. Most men I know would have left the fire on and given themselves away.\"\nThe girl smiled dryly, \"My father taught me what to do in case we were attacked. He had left me alone in the forest once to see what I would do. I learn quickly.\" she boasted. \"The cave was alot deeper than I thought, I found a dry spot just out of the reach of the wind. I couldn't see the mouth of the cave so I rested with the torch next to me for heat. Then I heard him.\" \n\nShe stopped seemingly shaken. \"He spoke to me for the first time. He asked me my name and why I was here.\" She paused, \"He told me to come further into the cave. I don't know why but I did.\" she continued. \"I followed his voice down the cave, then I saw it.\" she moved the tome to her other arm. \"The tome was on an altar, the candles adorning the walls left no wax trails and glowed a fierce blue. I saw the tome and he spoke again.\" She breathed, \"He said he would help me get the bandits. He said he would save my parents..... he said he would save us all. All I had to do was pick up the tome and he would come to me.\"\n\nGrethor slowly placed his hand on his belt, \"Lass. Who is it that came to you?\" he asked carefully. The old man had seen alot in this world but he was hesitant to see what it was she had seen.\n\nShe looked down at the tome, \"Krathul.\" She began, \"His name is Krathul.\" she breathed slowly, \"I picked the tome up and heard the voice again. The tome was written in a language I couldn't read but with each word I could hear the words in my head. He explained that the tome was his prison. The words were a lost language known only to mad men and skeletons, he explained that he was a powerful general who commanded a race lost to men in the times of need. He told me his stories as I read his tome. The words became clear to me, almost my native tongue. I sat in that cave for what seemed like days as he told me about his fall. As I finished the tome I read the final words in his voice.\" she paused and looked at the party, fear struck their eyes. \"Thrygune Mikeltas.\" she said slowly.\n\nOmega looked to Grethor for a reaction. The wizard picked a lump of wax out of his ear and flicked it into the bushes nearby. \"Sorry lass. Doesn't ring any bells. He doesn't sound too bad though.\"\n\nPreeta looked nervous, \"He wasn't. Until the bandits came back.\" she said with a pale look in her eyes. \"The more I read the more he spoke to me. He told me about his race and how they were the finest race to live. They left our realm to ascend to a new plane of life. An aspect we couldn't comprehend. He didn't want to leave. He explained to the tribes elders that they could live as gods. They could enslave anyone they wanted and destroy them with their power if they resisted.\" She swallowed, \"They disagreed with him. They explained our future and told him that they could not intervene or enslave the humans. Eventually we would find a way to break free and they would be destroyed. They chose to leave our realm and find a new home instead of eventually being destroyed.\" She moved the tome again, \"They told him he would not come with them and sealed him within the tome. Each word sealing his fate.\" She slowly pulled her sleeve up and revealed what looked like runic markings, \"The tome slowly poured into my body. These marking were once on the page. He lives within me and within the tome. I managed to understand enough of the tome to write a seal into it. That is all that stops him from destroying me and becoming whole again.\"\n\nGrethor smiled, \"You really do learn fast child.\" He said honestly, \"But if you have him under control how can you be scared of him?\"\nShe looked up and met the wizards eyes, \"If the tome leaves me he will destroy me and be reborn. As I began reading the tome again and again to learn how to destroy him I no longer craved food or water, I forgot what it was to be human. I felt my heart stop and breathing became something only necessary for speaking. He taught me to live past death. I lost myself in the tome..... that's when the bandits investigated the cave.\"\nShe paused, \"I don't know why but when they charged I ordered him to attack, He burst from the tome in a form I couldn't comprehend.\" She tightened her grip on the tome. \"His anger made him wilder, he attacked the bandits viciously and without mercy. They swung at air and screamed like children at the sight of him.\" She shuddered. \"When it was all over I stood clutching the tome. He looked at me without eyes, I knew he was angry at me for ordering him but I couldn't help feeling like a friend to him.\" She raised the tome to her chest. \"I ordered him back into the tome and he couldn't resist my commands. He angrily snapped and shouted at me as he went back in. I still hear his voice in my head and in the tome.\" She looked at Omega. \"He says you serve the wrong person and that you shouldn't be serving people who are less than you.\"\n\nOmega looked at the girl and the tome, \"Omega is not servant.\" he began confidently, \"Omega has friends who fight for him so Omega fights for them.\" He stood confidently. \"Omega will never hurt them or ask them to do anything for him. They are friends!\" He finished with a smile before crouching like the wizard did to her height. \"Preeta and Krathul can be friends. They just need to promise to help eachother.\"\n\nGrethor smiled, \"The lads right. We'll protect you if you protect us. We can help lass.\"\nPreeta spoke gently, \"I can summon him if you want.\" she asked. \"He tends to stay in a solid form for conversations.\" she paused, \"That's why I got scared of Omega. He looks like you do when he is in solid form.\"\nOmegas eyes lit up, \"Another Omega? Krathul is an Omega?\" He asked with glee.\nGrethor looked at the construct, \"Maybe lad. Let's see.\"\nPreeta nodded and spoke a few words into the tome, The ancient book flung open and shining dust flew out of the centre. The dust assembled into a tall figure, crystalline and shining he stretched out and looked at the party. He raised a finger to Omega, \"You serve no purpose to this party.\" he began in a deep voice. \"Seize the tome from the child and we will rule together!\" he ordered.\n\nThe adventurers drew their weapons ready. Krathul laughed, \"Your weapons will serve you as well as the girl will in your party!\" he boomed. \"Prepare to-\"\n\"KRATHUL SIT.\" Preeta interupted.\nThe crystalline construct slammed into the floor and grunted. He tried to move but seemed stuck. \"SNIVELLING CUR!\" he bellowed before his head buried itself into the ground in shame.\nOmega began laughing. The party nervously withdrew their weapons. Grethor mopped his brow, \"Child you're scared of him?\" he began. \"Omega here has more free will than this thing! Does he roll over or play dead?\" he joked.\n\nPreeta smiled, \"You're not scared of him?\" she began. \"He only takes simple commands. I can't make him stop talking but his pride is his biggest weakness.\" She looked at Omega who was now inspecting Krathul for markings like his. \"Does yours take commands as well?\"\n\nGrethor looked at the girl, \"Omega isn't a pet lass.\" he explained. \"He was a training construct  and his camp got attacked. He ran for safety and stumble into us.\" He brightened his tone, \"He's just like you. He ran and made new friends.\" his eyes rolled onto Krathul who was now being poked by Omega. \"Albeit, less angry than him.\" He coughed, \"Omega.\" The construct leapt to his feet. \"You're now part of our group so you get a vote in all ordeals that concern the party.\" He looked at the construct. \"When we vote we all choose what we want to do. Whichever option has the most votes is the one that we choose to do. No arguments just fair voting. Does that make sense?\" He asked.\n\nOmega scratched his head, \"Omega chooses one of the options that gets brought up and if more people choose an option than the others it get's chosen?\" he asked inquisitively back to the old man.\nGrethor laughed, \"Yes lad. Something like that. We're going to call a vote on letting the lass join us. We have to share supplies with her and the final prize so it's a decision we have to make carefully.\" He looked at Preeta, \"Lass you get to make a reason that you should join us. If you want to of course, Then we will vote.\"\n\nPreeta looked at the party, \"I would like to join you. Maybe Krathul will warm to you eventually.\" she said confidently. A muffled yell of defiance came from the crystal like structure on the floor.\nGrethor tapped his staff on the floor three times. The party gathered around him. A audible crack came from the tree as the bard stumbled out from his lookout post. Preeta looked up at the emerald cloaked stranger and jumped when the archer stood from behind the grain sack.\nGrethor spoke in a clear voice, \"Preeta, we are going to vote on your acceptance into our group. If you have anything to say that will help your cause please state them now.\" he stood back in line with the others.\n\nPreeta began to speak, \"I do not eat, I do not drink and I do not sleep. If you can put up with my endless scrolling of the tome and Krathul occasionally being a pain.\" she paused as a muffled laugh sounded from behind her. \"Then I will use Krathul to fight and keep him under control. I will watch over your camp at night and will swear my allegiance to you if need be.\"\n\nGrethor stood forward again, \"Preeta has spoken her views. If you would vote for her acceptance raise your weapon to the sky. If you decline then drop it to the floor.\" He stood back and raised his staff. \"You may begin.\"\n\nThe party slowly raised their weapons. The bard withdrew a dagger and held it up before winking at the girl. Omega withdrew his dagger and pointed it up. Grethor smiled, \"It's unanimous lass. You're in.\" before walking forward and greeting the new member.\n\nAs the party introduced themselves to the new member(s) Omega sat next to Krathul, \"Omega is happy that Krathul is friend now.\" He said to the construct.\nKrathul turned his head to the construct, \"You know little about what I am to you.\" he spat and slowly attempted to move, \"I will make sure that when I am free you will be the first to-\"\n\n\"SIT\" Omega chirped in with perfect accent and tone. He watched as Krathul crashed back into the ground. The party turned and saw Omega giggling to himself again. \"Grethor look! Omega learned a new spell!\" he shouted in glee.\n\nPreeta stood in shock, \"How?\" she asked, \"It took me months to learn how to do that!\"\nGrethor smiled, \"Omega is a copycat master.\" he said proudly. \"He can mimic anyone perfectly after meeting them for a bit and boy is he getting good at it.\"\nOmega looked at the party. \"We finish quest now friends?\" He asked excitedly.\nGrethor dusted the dirt off his cloak, \"Yeap lad.

        "text": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/32wxj9/dd_like_this_a_story_of_a_construct_and_his/   - Part 1!\n\nSeems alot of people liked my last story about Omega and how he met the adventure party as well as his uncanny ability of copying people!\n\nIn this encounter the party show their acceptance of Omega and he shows that he remembers some mannerisms from his time at the camp!\n\n--- Start of story ---\nThe party ventured forth from the Inn, Omega waved at the kind staff... well he waved at everyone. It was his new thing to show he was friendly and after learning it he did it everywhere. Grethor chuckled, \"Looks like you're enjoying ya'self there lad.\" \n\nOmega turned to the wizard, \"Omega saying not hello to our new friends!\" he said with glee. Grethor smiled and caught a tear from his eye. The aged man had seen many things in his travels but he was still adjusting to the fact that he had a 6ft tall indestructible child with him. Still it was a heart warming sight to see the construct so happy with making friends.\n\nAs they left the borders Grethor began explaining small things to the construct. He pointed to their travel route and said \"This is a road. It's smoother than the grass and less likely to bog us down.\"\n\nOmega nodded, \"So we travel on roads.\" the construct looked around the path seemingly taking notes. \"So we don't get bogged down or get lost?\"\n\nGrethor smirked, \"You're learning fast mah boy.\" he said and put a hand on the shoulder of Omega. \"Now lad, you remember what happened when you left home? With the bad people?\" he chose a serious tone but kept a calm pace. One thing Grethor had learnt was that Omega seemingly picked up on emotions despite not really having any himself.\n\nOmega shuddered slightly on the thought. He had never considered the camp anything but a place he was put together and where he lived for so long. \"The bad guys killed the trainers. I ran away because I didn't know what to do.\"\n\nGrethor looked at Omega, \"Sorry lad. Didn't mean to upset you just wanted to explain something about travelling.\" he cleared his throat, Omega watched with eagerness. \"Now when we met you my friends had their weapons out ready to attack. You remember right?\"\n\nOmega nodded, \"Very scary. Wasn't sure if to train or to run.\"\nGrethor smiled, \"Well they did that because they didn't understand if you were a friend or a bad guy. See sometimes people have to fight others like you did in training at the camp. It's not nice but we have to protect ourselves while we travel.\"\n\nOmega looked at the other adventurers. It was hard for him to understand that his new friends were once prepared to hurt him. \"Omega wants to protect friends. Omega is best at fighting and is adept mage.\"\n\nGrethor laughed again, \"For someone connected with gears and cogs lad you've got alot of heart.\" he looked at the construct, \"Well sometimes lad, bad people might try to get us when we travel. We can only defend ourselves and sometimes we might have to kill them.\" Grethor paused, \"If they attack, we'll need you to fight.... you ok with that pal?\" he asked hesitantly.\n\nOmega took almost a serious tone and stopped in his tracks. The party stopped in awe as the construct knelt before the wizard. \"You ok there lad?\" Grethor asked in a confused tone.\nOmega took the sword the party gave him off his back. \"Omega promises not to run, Omega will fight to save Grethor and his friends from bad guys. If Omega has to kill Omega will and Omega promises that he will stand shoulder to shoulder with anyone who tries to stop us.\"\n\nTitus the knight and Grendell the bard began clapping. The rest of the party joined in as Omega stood up. Grethor began clapping for the construct. \"Lad, we would be honoured to fight with you.\" he said as he wiped a tear from his eye. \"And we will never back down with you by our side.\" Omega looked around the party. Everyone smiled and clapped for him and his speech.\n\n\"So Omega is....\" he paused for lack of a better word. \"Adventurer?\" he asked. Titus who had remained silent since meeting the construct walked towards the construct and removed his helmet.\n\n\"Yes Omega. You're one of us now.\" and handed Omega an armoured glove. \"My name is Titus and this is a gauntlet I found on our last adventure. It's too small for me but I think it will make a nice addition to your already armoured frame.\" The man stood the same height as Omega, \"May I attach it to your hand Sir?\" he asked politely.\n\nOmega smiled, \"Titus...\" He started, \"Omega, likes...his present.\" he spoke slowly, constructing words into a long string like Titus did. With each word he looked to Grethor in approval and with each word the Wizard smiled and nodded gently to encourage him. \"Omega, says yes to you putting his glove on.\" He sped up towards the end to show he had learnt the knights phrasing.\n\n\"You're going to need a side arm if you're gonna fight with us!\" a voice called out from behind Omega. The construct turned and saw the archer walk towards him holding a small blade. \"This will serve you well if you're in a rush and the sword we gave you is too unwieldy.\" She said. \"I will attach it to your hip so you can draw it fast if you need it.\"\n\nOmega smiled at the archer. \"Thank you. All of you. Omega is thank you full.\" he turned to Grethor as Titus and the Archer walked away. \"We adventure now friends?\"\n\nGrethor stood in awe of his party. He had travelled with the worst of the worst as well as the noblest of lords and never had he seen such kindness towards anyone. \"Well. I suppose you'll be needing something from me!\" he said smiling, \"I can't give you steel or gold lad.\" he gestured as he removed a vial of clue liquid from his satchel at his waist. \"But I can give you some protection of my own. Hold out that hand without the glove on lad.\" Omega nervously raised his hand as the Wizard poured the contents of the vial over the back of Omegas hand. He drew a symbol into the liquid that rested on the constructs hand and began saying a incantation. Omega watched in awe and with a flare of clue light saw that the symbol was now shining on his hand. \"All done lad.\" The wizard said releasing his grip on the constructs hand, \"This will protect you from some magic spells. Gives you a fighting chance against mages now.\"\n\nOmega looked at his hands. His \"birthmark\" as Grethor had called it was shining brightly through the fabric on his glove and the symbol Grethor had etched into his hand was shining brightly on the other. \"Thank you friends.\" he said slowly, \"Omega will be unbeatable now!\" he finished as the party poured into laughter. \"We go get the bad guys now?\"\n\n\"Yes lad.\" Grethor chuckled. \"We're ready to go.\" he said smiling as the party began following the road again.\n\n--- end of introduction to Omega getting his gear ---\n\nThe dm told us about some options we could investigate to continue our quest. We decided to look into some local ruins to see if anyone could point us in the right direction. As we searched we come across a young girl clutching a mysterious tome. Who was our latest member of the Games Society who wanted to join DND.....\n\nOk so apparently Reddit has a character count! Will make a part 3 now!",

Infiltrate and investigate a dangerous crime family operating in the same system of Mon Calamari. Me, a thug extraordinaire and soldier named Tarek, and a Scoundrel named Jodon, are in charge of teh difficult operation. Most of the time we are a more \"kick doors, shoot everything\" kind of guys and we are good at it but this time, the soldier has a plan. We had forged documents, a cover identity as weapon dealers, some secret hyperspace routes and even photos of fake merchandise. We manage to get received by the crime lord and, of course, our weapons are confiscated. Thankfully, we are smooth talkers who knows about technology and weapons and they don't see our bluff. Too bad that now we have the definite proof that those guys work for the Separatist...In the form of GENERAL GRIEVOUS in their dining hall. Let me get this straight: we are alone, unarmed against a pissed off crime family and GENERAL GRIEVOUS. No time to panic. Before Grievous snatched the commlink, I manage to send a message to our troops and to the other two jedi party members. The cavalry is coming! We are forced to jump inside a fish tank where there is an angry Kraken inside! The scoundrel is thrown first and he he manages to actually fight it off with a makeshift harpoon! While the soldiers try to throw me in, I struggle with one of them, biting his hand with a natural 20 and taking his blaster! I blow the brains off of the other guard and I start to hold the gangsters and Grievous for a while while I wait for the others. No one manages to hit me, even! Not even Grievous. When our Jedi friend arrives, he blows up the tank by deflecting a bomb, sending the Kraken right on top of Grievous! Meanwhile, I manage to find a secret elevator when I see the water flow in the secret door. The group is saved and manages to fight another day, after wiping out the criminals and spanking Grievous' skinny butt.",

        "text": "*The following is an account of actual in-game events as experienced by a character I've created. The quotes are lifted from the game, and 98% of what happens is true, verbatim, and chronologically correct. The other 2% is dramatic embellishment that you should easily be able to recognize. After playing for an hour or two, I will be writing up the events of my playtime as a story for those who prefer reading over watching to enjoy.*\n\n*If, however, you prefer watching (or like both), you may watch Dei'Thuin's adventures on [Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/maltease)!*\n\nUpon meeting her, Steward Eminwe was a much kinder, albeit busier, person than Advisor Norion appeared to have been. She was very amiable and happy to have some help. She was currently in the process of preparing some shipments for the queen, but had heard tell that there may have been some shifty characters about the crates and sacks the nights before. She needed Dei'Thuin's help to investigate and, as before, he gladly obliged.\n\nThe storehouse was right next door so he popped on over. The crates appeared to be nailed shut, which he supposed was a good thing considering none immediately looked to have been tampered with, but she had asked that he make sure to investigate thoroughly and he had promised her he would. Thus, he picked up the nearby crowbar and started prying open crates.\n\nThe first four containers he looked into contained nothing of great import. Grain, apples, etc. None looked, smelled, or even tasted of evil. The last crate he pried open had a great deal of cured beef and he was convinced, as was his monkey, that it was edible and fine, but as he was closing the crate he noticed a hole in the lid. It was much too perfectly round to have been natural, and it was stained around the edges as if something had been poured through it. He grabbed a slab of meet from the crate, tucked it safely into his bag and returned to the steward.\n\nHis return was met with swift recognition. Eminwe thanked him profusely and asked that he hold onto the meet and bring it to Watch Captain Astanya, as the Watch Captain would be very interested in seeing this. Though Dei'Thuin really would have preferred to give it to her as he was now walking around with both classified plans and poisoned meat, he reluctantly agreed. Eminwe didn't give him much of a choice anyhow, as he bustled away as soon as he stammered out a reply.\n\nHe went toward town and quickly found the Watch Captain. A short, mean-looking woman, she seemed to recognize him immediately. Apparently word had travelled quickly of his usefulness, and Astanya appreciated his initiative. Because of all the good press, even, she asked if he wouldn't mind helping one of her guards with a situation just inside town. Apparently that had trapped a known low-level criminal in his home but he refused to come out and talk to any member of the Guard.\n\nThis all seemed very suspect to Dei'Thuin. The Watch Captain, and everyone else but Norion, had all seemed very rushed, but not in the sense that they had anything to do. They all just seemed to want to get rid of him and push him along to the next task. He chalked this up to paranoia from being so extremely dehydrated before and agreed. He tried to hand off the evidence he had found but Astanya pushed it back into his hands, saying that there was no time and he must quickly go to the house.\n\nDei'Thuin's beastial friend gave him a worried look. Even the monkey thought this all reeked of fish, but he wasn't exactly in a place right now to refuse a command from the Queen's guard. He put both pieces of evidence back into his satchel and made off in the direction of the home.\n\nIt was a very easy residence to spot, it turned out, because the whole place was surrounded by Guards in shining metal armor. One particularly decorated fellow was shouting at the door about 20 feet away from it, asking for the resident to please exit so they could discuss matters. A muffled, quiet reply came from inside the house and the guard threw his hands up in dismay. \n\nAs the presumably ranking officer turned to speak to the two gentlemen behind him, he spied Dei'Thuin approaching. “Please step back, we have a situation here,” the guard said. Dei'Thuin explained that he had been sent by Watch Captain Astanya to assist, and the guard's shoulders sank as if a great weight had been lifted from them. “Ah, help from the Captain. Excellent,” said the man. He introduced himself as Watchman Heldil and re-explained everything the Captain had already told Dei'Thuin. The man inside refused to come out and, anytime the Watchmen approached the door, threatened to kill himself. He was also actively wanted by the Crown and was in possession of valuable information.\n\nDei'Thuin, at Heldil's insistence, approached the door. “Get back! One step closer and I'll slit my throat,” came the response from inside to Dei'Thuins footsteps. He explained that he was not a member of the guard and simply wanted to talk. After a quick back and forth and explanation that the gentleman inside didn't have much of a choice other than to let Dei'Thuin in, the door was unlocked and the monkey led the way.\n\nOnce inside, Dei'Thuin saw that the man had pointed ears and yellow-green skin. For a moment, he was lost in thought as more memories came flooding back. Him in front of a pool of water, dipping a hand in and taking a drink. The water rippled for a moment and then smoothed, and he saw himself. Dark-skinned, long beard and those same, large, pointed ears. He came back to reality and realized one hand had drifted up, touching the tip of his left ear. He quickly dropped it back to his side.\n\n“You're no guard. Thank the stars. Quickly, we don't have much time,” the olive-skinned man told Dei'Thuin. He went on to explain, almost too fast for Dei'Thuin to understand, that he knew this was all just a distraction and that Dei'Thuin needed to act quickly. Captain Astanya, he said, was corrupt and a member of a group called the Veiled Heritance.\n\nThis group, the man said, was planning and assassination of the Queen at the temple she was supposed to be speaking at very soon. They had supposedly bribed members of the Queen's staff to get the speech moved to this town so they could have the Captain in their pocket. The only evidence this man had was what he had seen and heard. He insisted that Dei'Thuin must inform the Queen and save her life, then they were interrupted by the Watchman bursting through the door.\n\nThey approached and quickly apprehended the pointy-eared man. Heldil turned to Dei'Thuin and said, “Good work!” Dei'Thuin suddenly felt queasy, unsure of how to proceed. He asked what was to be done with the man in custody. Heldil assured him he would receive a fair trial by the Captain, but in the meantime would be locked in a cell. He thanks Dei'Thuin for his assistance and advised him he should report back to the Captain, who had moved to protect the Queen at the Manor House. Dei'Thuin thanked the Watchman and left to meet the captain.\n\nIt was a short hike to the Manor House and Dei'Thuin enjoyed it. The fresh air felt good in his lungs and though his muscles had ached and begged to be stretched when he had awoken on the boat, they now felt limber and eager for movement. The monkey seemed to be enjoy the bustling town as well, hopping to and fro, growing more curious to his surroundings and they stepped further toward the town's center.\n\nBefore they reached the center, however, they came upon the manor house, outside of which stood the Captain. Dei'Thuin waved his hand and approached, informing her that he had assisted Watchman Heldil with great success. The captain's normally mean-demeanor looked a tad off. She looked aggressive, like he had done something wrong. “By order of the Crown I am placing you under arrest for plots against the Queen,” she said to him.\n\nObviously confused, Dei'Thuin asked what was going on and what proof she had. She beckoned one of her guards to take his satchel and search it. “It would seem you're in possession of classified documents belonging to the Crown, as well as some poisoned food. That alone is enough to lock you up.” The Captain smirked evil, “Thank you for your assistance,” and Dei'Thuin felt a sharp blow to the back of his head.\n\nAs the world went dark around him, his last image was that of the Captain pulling out a pair of iron shackles, bearing down on him and grinning evilly. Despite this sudden, albeit not entirely shocking betrayal, his thoughts turned to his monkey friend. The only friend it seemed he truly had now. Who knew when the Prophet would contact him again. He'd tried help this Port Town in any way he could, and he now found himself wrapped up, yet again, in affairs he deemed much to large for himself. He seemed to be the type of person who had a penchant for destinies that didn't belong to him.\n\nRight now, however, seemed to be a great time to sleep.",

His body still ached, his mouth, eyes, and insides were still dry, but he felt distinctly...alive. Dense might have been a better word for it, in a physical sense. The floor beneath him rocked gently. The air smelt of salt and water, not to mention warm sand. He took a deep breath of the humid air, savoring even the small amount of moisture it brought into his lungs. Off to one side, he heard the sound of small, shuffling feet. \n\nAs he opened his eyes he felt a hand slam into his cheek, palm presumably open, and his face erupted in pain. His eyes flew open and he saw his monkey friend grinning down at him, open hand still in the air. It whooped at him a few times and started bouncing excitedly. Dei'Thuin glared at the beast and sat up.\n\nThough not quite sure where he was, he got the distinct feeling it was inside of a boat. The air, sounds, and gentle rocking were all a dead giveaway. He was in a room with two sets of bunk beds, someone lying sound asleep on the bottom bunk on his left. Their snores were easily drowned out by the muffled sounds of waves coming from outside.\n\nHe glanced toward the door and, startled, saw the ghostly apparition of a familiar old man. “Ah, Vestige, we meet again. Come here, we must speak.” The old man's ghost beckoned Dei'Thuin closer and was obliged. They had been separated, the Prophet informed him, and Dei'Thuin had been dropped into the sea. A kind soul had fished him out, but that's as far as the Prophet knew. The old man himself was in a dry place, full of ash and battle. Dei'Thuin had won this lottery.\n\nThough the Prophet couldn't tell Dei'Thuin what to do or where to go currently, he said his current goal was to figure out a way to repay Lyris' sacrifice. He couldn't leave her to Molag Bal, and he had to act fast. The Prophet said he would be contacting Dei'Thuin soon, and with that he disappeared. The monkey whimpered as it sat on its haunches next to him. He knelt down and petted the creature's head, soothing its fears. He was uncertain as well, but they couldn't just stay on this ship. They ventured out into the hallway to find their way out.\n\nThere were plenty of crates and barrels out here filled with food and presumably water or spirits. He saw an open bag of apples and all but threw himself at them, devouring 3 full apples in the span of about 2 minutes. Their juice dripped shamelessly into his dark beard and he felt himself rejuvenating with every bite. As he finished, he noticed an empty satchel lying next to the crates and bags of fruit. He picked it up and filled it a third up with apples. He tossed one more to his monkey and made for the stairs leading upward at the end of the hall.\n\nAt the top of the stairs, laid into the wall, was an ornate, golden symbol in the shape of a shield. He had absolutely no idea what it was or meant, but it certainly looked gorgeous. He turned and saw behind him what appeared to be the door to the outside. Gladly, he stepped through and into the bright coastal sunlight.\n\nAs he opened the door, a voice bellowed from across the ship. “Ha! I was worried you'd never wake up. You slept all the way from Khenarthi's Roost. Right through the hurricane!” Dei'thuin crossed the deck and the man who had spoken to him, mug of beer in hand, introduced himself as Captain Tremouille. Apparently a Khajiit named Razum-Dar had scooped him from his watery grave and paid the good Captain a large sum of money to bring him to this port. \n\nWhen pressed, the good-humored captain said Razum-Dar was last seen heading to a fort on Khenarthi's Roost named Eagle's Strand. The this ship wouldn't be heading back that way for a long while, Tremouille recommended Dei'Thuin talk to a boatswain at the docks named Sugar-Claws for assistance. Dei'Thuin gave his thanks and disembarked from the boat with his monkey.\n\nThe docks were buzzing with activity. People selling fish and freshly imported fruits in ramshackle stalls spotted the beach. It all looked delicious to Dei'Thuin, but he was on a mission to find Sugar-Claws. He tried to stop some of the people rushing around him but none had the time, or the desire, to answer his questions. He was suddenly very aware that he had no money and nothing to offer anyone should they decide to help him. This was a problem.\n\nThus, he approached an uppity gentlemen whose named turned out to be Norion. Advisor Norion, to be precise, and it luckily turned out that Advisor Norion needed a great bit of help. It seemed the Queen's Guard had tracked a burglar to a nearby warehouse, and this thief was believed to in possession of some very delicate plans that belonged to the Crown. Norion asked if Dei'Thuin would head into the warehouse to investigate, and he happily obliged.\n\nMonkey in tow, Dei'Thuin confidently strode into the warehouse only to be met with a stomach-turning site. A man dressed in black thiefs attire had another man, dressed in commoner garb, by the collar of his shirt and held a knife to his throat. They exchanged a few quick, quiet words and the black thief plunged his knife into the commoner's neck, spilling to poor man's blood down his front.\n\nWith a flash and some smoke, the black thief disappeared and the dead commoner fell to the floor. Dei'Thuin, both confused and frightened, stood in silence for a moment. He'd just witnessed a murder, and with the invisibility tactics the actual perpetrator just used he had a feeling it may be pinned on him. Not the best foot to start off on in a new town. He hustled to the corpse and searched the commoner's pockets for anything at all. He found a roll of parchment labeled, “Property of the Queen's Guard” and breathed a heavy sigh of relief. This, at least, would give him some traction.\n\nHe nervously left the warehouse and returned to Advisor Norion, handing him the scroll. He explained what he'd witnessed, fearing Norion would call the guards any second, but the Advisor seemed nonplussed. “Feh, some kind of criminal feud, I'm sure,” Norion said disgustedly. He handed the plans back to Dei'Thuin and asked that he hand them off to Watch Captain Astanya, but recommended that he find another person who may need his assistance: Steward Eminwe.",

        "text": "So, after the events of Part 2, the only thing the characters know is that their bard has just been sucked into a rent in the fabric of reality which then closed behind her. They had known this character for all of a day, maybe, so no one had any reason to be especially torn up about her (apparent) death, and the party moves on through the dungeon with the sorcerer taking up the Jakkawab. He uses it almost immediately on a group of vampires he finds in the armory, and gets the effect which reverses gravity for three seconds within a certain radius. All the PCs fall onto the ceiling and back down, getting a bit bruised, while the vampires were a little worse off; they fell onto the ceiling and were impaled by the metric fuckload of weapons in the armory. The fall back to the floor drove the weapons in deeper, and I just assumed that enough shit had impaled them that something had to have pierced their hearts, killing them. \n\nA few rooms later, the group enters an entirely empty chamber. The floor, walls, and ceiling were entirely flat, nothing at all was in here. Yet the sorcerer rolls to loot it. We all chuckle and let him roll. Fucker gets a one god damn hundred. I am baffled. Bamboozled, even. So I tell him that his character digs down, through the floor, out of the pocket dimension, into a cave miles underground on the material plane where he finds another ancient and powerful dwarven relic, then jumps back up and reappears in the room. Y'know. As you do.\n\nThat wasn't even the real shit here though. Motherfuckers are going up a few stairs, fighter is leading the way. He sets off a trap and takes a wee bit of damage, ain't no thing. Then he opens the door at the top and barges into the next room, alone, and is faced with three powerful devils. They rush toward him, and I have him roll initiative. He rolls a 20. Confirm the critical? He rolls another 20. Once more for shits and giggles? A third fucking 20. \n\nOh baby a triple!\n\nHis next roll was an 11 or something, but at this point no one cares because people are losing their shit. Chaos and pandemonium. Screaming and laughter. V-JDayInTimesSquare.jpg. This is the first triple twenty I have ever witnessed in nearly four years of tabletop gaming. So what does the fighter do? He takes the fucking initiative. Son of a bitch seizes the fabric of time in his hands, reaches back and retroactively dodges the trap, erasing the damage he had received. Then he steps forward, the devils standing frozen before him, and fucking kills them instantly. He gets all the experience from the encounter and levels up. What do the other player characters see? They see the fighter open a door, then suddenly there is a trap that has gone off ineffectually and the fighter is just standing over three dead devils. We all basked in the glory of this for some time, and I ultimately decided to give that character a permanent +3 to initiative.\n\nAnd finally, after three damn separate posts, the story of that ONE fucking session is complete. There will be more tales to come, but for now I reiterate, one last time: I regret nothing.",

        "text": "After the positive comments I got on my first post [God King of the North in the South](http://redd.it/30iqf0) , I figured I'd share some more stories about our mad, 302 year old wizard, Griffin Dawntracker.\n\nThis was well before the viking incident as I like to cal it. The Party had just completed their first major quest. hey had delivered their mysterious cargo to a mysterious man in the independent city of Lyn'Thain. This quest was their first and is also very important to the main story though they didn't realize it at the time.\n\nAnyway, at this time, they had the entire sandbox of my world to explore at their leisure. Naturally, they had no idea what to do with this limitless freedom. Thankfully, I'd set up a system to deal with that particular problem specifically. Basically, there is a guild dedicated to the collection of news and information, including mercenary contracts and the like, and distributing them for a \"finder's fee\"\n\nThe Players took a contract to guard the caravan of a gnomish scholar who wants to secure and explore a nearby ruin for historical artifacts etc. They are joined by two other NPC mercs (this event is also prior to when the samurai, who happens to be Griffin's nephew, joins the party btw)\n\nTo skip ahead, the ruin was infested with bugbears who had been bullied into serving something stronger referred to as \"the boss\". After slaying several groups of them, they entered the final chamber of the ruin where they saw a large vault door, some ancient books which disintegrate as they touched them, and guarding it all, an Ettin and his 4 bugbear captains. The Ettin, this one unusually smart for it's race, sent his bugbears to fight the party of 7 as a means of gauging their abilities. After two of them died, he himself charged violently. His first mace missed the paladin by inches, the second slammed into the monk and knocked him across the room. (After both a reflex save and tumble check) The Monk landed on his feet and slid to a stop, balancing on the balls of his feet and his fingers (badass moment) but he'd lost almost all of his health. At this point, the Cleric (Kaladin) and Griffin began discussing options. The Paladin and the Cleric decided to both expend some healing on the monk as he is one of the party's front line fighters. Meanwhile, the Wizard began laughing maniacally and pronounces excitedly\n\nGriffin: I cast *Web!*\n\nWe all look at him like he'd lost his mind. \n\nMe: Griffin... you know that's basically just a magic net, right? The Ettin is going right after you and your one move is to use a magic net on it? One small strength check and he'll end you.\n\nGriffin: Yep!\n\nOther Player:Griffin, it's pretty much a utility spell. It's almost worthless in combat...\n\nGriffin: We'll seen about that.\n\nProceeds to cast web.\nI think to myself, \n\"well, it's been a good run for you griffin. But you've done f***ed up now.\"\nEttin laughed at the puny net.\n\nEttin: You idiots. This ain't gonna stop us! We're gonna grind you to bone dust.\n\nI rolled the strength check to rip off the net. \n\nEttin rolled a 1.\nF*** me.\n\nEttin spends turn flailing it's arms wildly but to no avail. Now, the monk had made a recovery and decided it was payback time. He charged the netted beast and used stunning palm. Success, the Ettin was now both netted *and* stunned.\n\nF***. Me.\n\nThen the cleric got clever too. He cast heat metal on the Ettin's weapons, then just sat back with a \"now we wait\" face. In the meantime, the fighter and paladin were finishing off the bugbears. Griffin's turn rolled around and he announced that he had done all he could to finish this as he had no spells remaining. This left it to the monk. The Ettin didn't stand a chance. The monk, using flurry of blows, put the absolute beat down on that Ettin for two turns, landing all but 1 of them, and two of them were critical hits. y the time the Ettin was un-stunned, he'd lost over half of his health and had started taking damage from his weapons which had surprisingly (to him) become red hot to the touch. Unarmed and netted, the monk landed another stunning palm. Not to be out done, the rogue climbed the thing's back and landed a backstab straight into the space between it's two heads which killed on of the heads, and sett up the monk for his killing blow, a vault from the monster's bent knee (it fell to one knee from pain) that lead into a reverse roundhouse that snapped the neck of the other head. \n\nWith the fight over, everyone was congratulating the monk on his performance when her reminded them.\n\nJudeas(Half-Orc Monk): I would have died before touching him if the fight had been fair. I owe this victory to Griffin.\n\nGriffin was reclining against a pillar, laughing to himself. He then stands up straight and in his gruff old voice shouts proudly!\n\nGriffin: Utility spell, eh? Who says Utility spells are worthless?!\n\nEDIT: I think I've fixed the grammar and format errors. If anyone sees any, feel free to point them out.",

After playing for an hour or two, I will be writing up the events of my playtime as a story for those who prefer reading over watching to enjoy.*\n\n*If, however, you prefer watching (or like both), you may watch Dei'Thuin's adventures on [Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/maltease)!*\n\nTamriel. That word struck a nerve, a good one. A couple flashes of memory hit him like a ton of bricks. The smell of fields of flowers, giant mushrooms the size of homes, snow-capped mountains with wind roaring at their tips. It physically rocked him back on his heels, but he held fast. That was home. He was almost home. But why was it up to him, and not the both of them?\n\nLyris explained that she couldn't go with him and the monkey. The cell could never be empty; the only way to get someone out of the cell was to replace them with another living, breathing soul. Not a Soul Shriven, she corrected Dei'Thuin, but a living person. Since she was the only one here who fit the bill, she would have to be the one to replace the Prophet. Dei'Thuin, with his limited knowledge, tried to find a way around it. He couldn't.\n\nShe had obviously already resigned herself to this fate, and Dei'Thuin need only do what he was told, much to his chagrin. She asked him to protect her while the transfer occurred, and he obliged. She stepped onto the viewing platform and the runes at her feet began to glow that familiar blue. She lifted into the air, as if floating, and her limbs snapped to corners. She squirmed and winced, but Dei'Thuin couldn't watch for long. A Daedra had appeared on the right and was making for Lyris. He quickly stepped between the two and felled the beast in three heavy swings. Instead of crumpling like the others it erupted into bright white light, all of which flew over Dei'Thuin's head and landed on top of one of two pedestals flanking the viewing platform.\n\nJust as quickly as the first, a second Daedra appeared on Lyris' left and, using the last bit of his strength, Dei'Thuin dealt with it equally. The same light erupted from the chest of the second Daedra and flew to the empty pedestal. Both balls of light split and formed identical structures: Two pyramids, one pointing up and one pointing down, on either side of a dark sphere. Lyris screamed in agony as twin streams of light poured from the spheres and into her sides. Dei'Thuin, unsure of what to do, approached the structures. He reached out with a hand and just as his finger brushed the sphere the whole structure collapsed in on itself and the stream of light was cut off.\n\nStartled, he looked up at Lyris and caught a flash of brown-orange at the other pedestal. The monkey had climbed the side of the rock ornament and was reaching out with his own tiny hand toward the sphere. As soon as it touched the sphere, the monkey let out a short scream and was thrown back a couple of feet. Dei'Thuin rushed toward the monkey, seeing smoke rising from its body. He picked it up and hugged it close to him, willing it to live. He felt it breathing, albeit shallowly, and the weight lifted off his shoulders. They were going to make it.\n\nLyris screamed again and her body shook. The Prophet's body, still hanging suspended in his dark blue prison of smoky liquid, mimicked the movement and, after a moment, both bodies flung toward each other. As they slammed together, a huge, dark blue vertical circle flattened out from the point of impact and, as if rebounding, the Prophet's body flew forward and landed in a heap on the viewing platform. Dei'Thuin looked to the prison and saw Lyris' body silently fly into the spherical cell where it stopped with a painful looking jerk. Dei'Thuin felt the monkey squirm with life in his arms as he stood and moved toward the Prophet.\n\nThe old man stood with great difficulty and addressed Dei'Thuin regally, thanking him for his efforts and vowing that Lyris' sacrifice would not be in vain. Though there was not a way they could free her at this moment, the blind man told Dei'Thuin, they would hopefully achieve that once they had returned to Tamriel. The Prophet spoke of machines called Anchors, Daedric inventions that acted as connections between Tamriel and Coldharbour, pulling the former toward the latter. They could use these as a way to return home, but as the Prophet was blind he would need Dei'Thuin, whom he called the Vestige, to guide him.\n\nThey made their way, monkey cradled softly in Dei'Thuin's arms, up the stairs behind Lyris' new prison and through what he hoped was their final door. Then, suddenly, they were outside. It was still the cold, unforgiving dark outside of Coldharbour, but it was outside none-the-less. If he looked up he could see the swirling clouds around the tips of the great metal spires that reached toward them like hungry hands from a pit. There, in front of them, was a large contraption filled with more swirling blue energy, but not dark like the prison. This was light, and would have been welcoming if it hadn't looked so ominous.\n\nAs if to drive home that last point, a huge beast made of the familiar blue and black energy rose from the depths of the machine and placed its massive hands on either side as if to pull itself up. A thundering, raspy, familiar voice shook Dei'Thuin's mind again, “WELL DONE MORTALS, BUT THIS IS THE REALM OF DEATH ITSELF. THE ARMIES OF UNLIFE ARE ENDLESS!” Erupting from the ground in front of this gigantic energy beast came what appeared to be a hastily thrown together mass of skeletons. Dense, heavy, and awfully mean-looking, the magical beast pulled itself to its feet and lumbered its way toward Dei'Thuin.\n\n“Fight! I'll protect you,” shouted the Prophet. Dei'Thuin placed the monkey on the ground and ran past the monster, pulling its attention safely away, and then fight he did. It was easily the most exhausting battle he'd been in today. At first every swing seemed to just bounce off the skeleton beast harmlessly. It would reach down with its massive, bony hands and try to grab him. Luckily, its grasp was fragile and he was able to break free. Dei'Thuin used his speed to his advantage, moving around its feet quickly and swinging at its lower vertebrae. Eventually he managed to weary the thing, shattering a few bones and eventually felling it with a few lightning blasts from the old man's staff.\n\nWeary, bloody, and probably broken from the day, Dei'Thuin fell to his knees. His monkey, weak though still lively, rushed to his side and leaned on his leg. The Prophet spoke quickly, saying something about Nirn and skyshards and reattunement. Dei'Thuin was too numb to care at this point. The prophet conjured a large white-blue crystal and pointed at it. Dei'Thuin got up unsteadily, walked to the crystal and placed a hand on it. Warmth spread up his arm and all over him, a welcome contrast to the bone-shriveling coldness of this place. He would be glad to be rid of it. As he stood, monkey heeling once more, the Prophet moved toward the chasm the giant energy beast had risen out of, and had since disappeared from, and began speaking to someone named Akatosh. Dei'Thuin gathered it was a dragon god of some kind, likely dealing with affairs he still wanted no part of. As time went on, however, he felt more and more that he no longer had a choice in it. The prophet yelled over the roaring wind of the now boiling energy within the anchor, “Hurry! We must go now!” The old man then, rather unceremoniously, leapt into the energy and was carried gently upwards on its currents.\n\nDei'Thuin looked down at his monkey, the only thing from this place he felt a real connection to anymore. It looked up at him and grinned that toothy smile while making a couple of deep, throaty whoops. Dei'Thuin smiled weakly, picked the monkey up, and meandered to the edge. He turned and took one last look at the place that, in such a short time, had taken him on such a tumultuous ride. He shook his head and fell backward, passing out with his monkey nestled safely in his arms as the currents of the Prophet's spell carried him smoothly upward, returning him to his home.",

A hulking Daedra in spiked armor, complete with imposing, black, horned helmet held a prisoner by the neck. He was choking the poor soul and holding him up in the air as if he were nothing. After a few gasps and a bit of struggling, the Daedra hurled the prisoner backward onto a bed of metal spikes jutting out of the wall. Then it turned its attention to them.\n\nThree oven-like forges laid behind their foe, fiery with burning corpses no doubt. The light shone on the black armor of the Daedra as if it had just stepped out of a pool of water. Dei'Thuin didn't have time to stand in awe of the setting, as the monster took toward him with a mace. Lyris first swung, followed by Dei'Thuin, and both blows struck hard against the metal armor. It dazed the Daedra and Lyris stood proud, almost wallowing in her small victory, but Dei'Thuin had learned to take his chances. He struck again, cracking the armor much to his surprise. The warrior stumbled backward but brought his mace to bear. It flamed at the top, then he brought it up and back down quickly as if he were cracking a whip.\n\nFittingly, from the top of the mace came a long, thick strand of solid flame. It came down right across Dei'Thuin's shoulder and burned like hell. He winced and backed away, unwittingly giving his foe an opening. Luckily, Lyris took the chance to blindside the mace-wielder with her ax, chopping right into his neck. The chop knocked it straight to the floor, but it wasn't yet dead. Dei'Thuin quickly stepped forward and, before it could stand again, thrust his sword into the nape of its neck victoriously.\n\nWith that, Dei'Thuin felt a surge of relief come over him. He felt brighter, more agile, and most certainly stronger. Though he still did not prefer it, it was quickly getting much easier to wield the heavy sword he had found. He also felt a strange tickling near the back of his neck in the same spot he had placed his coup de grâce on their enemy. Without thinking, Dei'Thuin blinked and the world went fuzzy. Sound was muffled, but still audible, and Lyris looked around confused. He looked down at himself and realized he could see the floor, but not his body. Then, just as quickly as it started, he was solid once more. The fuzzy feeling had left and he stood in relative silence, the burning fires behind them breaking the quiet only just.\n\n“The god of brutality knows of your escape. Hurry!” The old man's voice rang in his mind like a church bell, startling him into motion. He and Lyris bolted down the long room toward a large, black door. It looked an awful lot like an exit, and he hoped it would be. This place was getting stifling. It took them both, but they heaved one of the two heavy doors open and stepped out into cool, refreshing air.\n\nLaid out before them was a cold, desolate, rocky landscape. The sky was dark blue, almost black with cloud cover though there was no storm. A river ran through the valley beneath them and its water glowed blue like the crystal in his cell. It looked refreshing, and though he ached for liquid he resolved not to drink from its depths. Best to leave as much of this place here as he could. A row of chained prisoners stood stock still on the small bridge that crossed the river, waiting for orders.\n\n“The God of Schemes can see every part of Coldharbour. We need to distract him,” Lyris said urgently. She quickly reminded him that their immediate goal was to blind a Sentinel, and pointed across the river to a high cliff. That was their target. Without a moment of haste, Dei'Thuin took briskly down the ramp from the door they'd just exited to the ground below. As he drew nearer he saw an old, decaying battlefield. Siege engines spotted the landscape like acne on a scarred visage. They decayed and rusted, left alone for ages it seemed. As he rushed toward the river, a Daedra not unlike the first two he had slain stepped from behind one of these with a flaming sword held high in intimidation. Dei'Thuin quickly dispatched of this enemy with two heavy swings, leaving it lifeless on the ground as he had so many others.\n\nHe crossed the river using the very same bridge he had spied from afar, not taking the time to assist the prisoners. They didn't seem to notice him anyhow, so he felt no guilt. Just up a soft incline that led to a much steeper grade, he saw a large, jagged semi circle covered in spikes sticking out of the ground. An obvious path ran through the center of it. The piece itself looked largely ceremonial, and while he was intrigued he simply did not have the time to stop. He rushed through it and up the slope. As he tired, he took a sharp right and continued to climb. Though the hill wasn't terribly tall, all things considered, he was still in considerably poor shape. Yes, dispatching the large Daedra with the whip-mace had invigorated him a small amount, but he was still heaving with fatigue and his mouth was drier than the hottest deserts.\n\nSoon he crested the slope and stood looking at a large, flat circle made of black stone laid flat into the ground. A waist-high wall surrounded the whole thing, giving a small amount of protection to the swirling mass of smoke and light floating ominously in the center. It looked unmistakably like an eye, with the addition of a bright cone of light coming from its pupil. It moved hurriedly and in a jerking fashion, as if to catch even the slightest movement. It was luckily looking away from Dei'Thuin currently, and that meant it was his chance. He crouched down and moved as quickly as he could toward the swirling mass that looked more solid with every step he took.\n\nOnce he was within striking distance, he thrust his sword directly into the back of the eyeball and was met with a loud, piercing screech as the eyeball shuddered and rolled upward. After a moment he yanked the sword from within the smoke and with a soft *poof* the entire eyeball disappeared. He heard hurried footsteps behind him, followed by the breathless voice of Lyris. “Quickly, while he's blinded we must get to the prophet's cell!”\n\nDei'Thuin stole down the ramp he had just climbed, each step a leap forward as the descent proved much easier than the ascent. He went back through the ornamental circle he'd come through and looked around, spying a large portal-shaped device back across the river. Lyris rushed toward it and Dei'Thuin followed suit, but as they approached the centerpiece of the structure was lit by blue flame and a thundering, grating voice shook his mind. “NONE CAN ESCAPE MY PRISON OF COLDHARBOUR,” it shouted.\n\n“Hermaeous Mora's wagging tongue, the door is warded! We'll never get in this way,” shouted Lyris in disgust. “Destroying the Sentinel must have triggered these wards. We'll have to find another way in.” Lyris thought for a moment and a name came to her, suddenly: Cadwell. When pressed, she claimed that Cadwell was the oldest of the Soul Shriven, those who had been sacrificed to Molag Bal and left to rot in Coldharbour. Apparently most of his, and Dei'Thuin's, kind eventually went insane, but not Cadwell. He was already insane when he arrived, which made him the most sane creature in this place. Typically he could be found by the river, so they made off.\n\nThey found Cadwell by the river indeed, sitting with others around a campfire will playing a lute and singing songs as if this was the merriest place in the world, all while wearing a pot on his head like a hat. Pleasant enough, if a little eccentric, Cadwell was kind enough to advise them that the entrance to the Prophet's Enclosure could be found at one end of the river, just inside the mouth of a cave. He called it the Undercroft. If they stuck to the light and held their noses, Cadwell said, they would quickly find a ladder that would take them straight up to the Prophet. While he was speaking, Dei'Thuin's monkey cautiously walked up to the man. The monkey sniffed, reached out with a hand and swatted at a loose piece of cloth hanging off of him, then looked up at the old Soul Shriven. It made a couple of low whooping sounds and bounced a little on its feet, then quickly ran back to Dei'Thuin's side, heeling by his left leg obediently.\n\nLyris and Dei'Thuin took off down the river, following its winding bank. “Cadwell seems to think this Undercroft is a delightful place. Probably means it's a deathtrap. We'll have to be careful,” Lyris advised. Eventually the bank ran out and they had to trudge through the water. At this point, the monkey took to Dei'Thuin's shoulder again, safely out of the way of the glowing liquid. Just as Cadwell foretold, at the end of the river they saw the gaping mouth of a cave, surrounded in luminous blue mushrooms, with a heavy metal door set a hundred yards back into it. Lyris ran forward and tried to push the door open to no avail. She slammed her fists on it, giving it a couple of good shoves with her shoulder, but could not get it to budge. In a huff, she turned to Dei'Thuin, “The sooner you get that door open, the sooner we can get out of here.”\n\nUnappreciative of her tone, but weary from the atmosphere of Coldharbour, Dei'Thuin set about looking at the lock. He couldn't remember ever having picked a lock. His hand absently slipped into his pocket and he felt a small metal object. It was thin but long, perfectly suited to fit in the lock before him. How convenient. He slid the pick into the lock and proceeded to mindlessly fiddle with it. He felt five pins he could push up, each one deeper than the previous. After pushing on the first one, he felt it wiggle and quickly stopped pushing, fearing he would break the lock. Instead the pin remained locked into place. With growing confidence, he did the same with the next four pins and then turned the pick as if it were a key. Without ceremony, the door swung open with a loud creak and they were in.\n\nIf ever there were a labyrinthine cave dungeon, this was the model it took after. The caves wound left and right, the walls covered in moss and more of the glowing blue fungus. For a time, they thought they were safe, but at the first intersection they came upon Dei'Thuin felt a shift in the air. From the crossroads rose, as if being pulled upward by the chest by a magical fist, the skeletal remains of a long-dead warrior. Still wearing the helmet and armor of its former life, and still wielding the same short sword, it took after Lyris and Dei'Thuin.\n\nThough they were quickly dispatched, the skeletons kept rising as the two made their way through the cave. They would jump from around corners and come to life behind them; their creaking bones the only give away to their presence. It was tiring work, and they would be lying if they said the fragile creations didn't get a few good shots in, but by the time they finally reached the final hallway they were glad to be passed it. The monkey, however, had seemed to enjoy the trial from his constant seat of safety within the shadows. He was grinning and bouncing up and down on the ground next to Dei'Thuin. He had been taking a liking to the beast, but in this moment it made him more weary than happy. Still, he had made a promise to himself that they would both make it out of this place.\n\nThe only thing standing between them and the door to their salvation were two demon heads placed on the walls on either side of the hallway. They both spat blue fire and smoke at timed intervals, with only a brief moment of pause between the two of them; a synchronicity error that had surely come with age, rather than by design. After a couple moments of brief planning and rhythm, Lyris stole through the path just before the flames began again. Dei'Thuin followed shortly thereafter, monkey safely on his shoulder.\n\nThe chamber they entered walking through the door was much smaller than he thought it would be, but he quickly realized it was more of an alcove than a chamber. The real deal, so to speak, lay just beyond the other entryway on the opposite side of the room they were currently in. He could see a tumultuous dark mass of smoky liquid suspended in mid-air just through that opening and his stomach dropped. He had known, certainly, that they were dealing with dark magic of a high caliber. It just hadn't really hit him until this moment. Blame the adrenaline, he supposed. Still, pressing on was his only option. He and his monkey had come this far, there was no turning back.\n\n“The prophet's gate should be just ahead. Quickly, now, we haven't much time!” Lyris sprinted toward the open doorway at the other side of the room and Dei'Thuin followed. They quickly reached a sort of viewing platform that looked directly at what Dei'Thuin could only assume was the Prophet, suspended in his dark jail. “Alright,” said Lyris. “The good news is we made it here in one piece, and the Prophet looks unharmed.” Dei'Thuin wanted to say that no one ever describes a truly good situation with ‘the good news is’ unless they're trying to disguise a bad situation, but he held his tongue as Lyris continued. “Now the bad news. It's going to be up to you to keep him safe and get him back to Tamriel.”",

After playing for an hour or two, I will be writing up the events of my playtime as a story for those who prefer reading over watching to enjoy.*\n\n*If, however, you prefer watching (or like both), you may watch Dei'Thuin's adventures on [Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/maltease)!*\n\nDei'Thuin woke up cold, wearing naught but shredded rags. Each breath stretched his lungs as if they'd been shriveled and dried; cured like slabs of pork. Dei'Thuin groaned and rolled onto his back. The floor was textured, made of rough stone. It sapped the warmth from his body greedily and stuck to him like flypaper. As he tried to open his eyes he realized they too were dried out. He blinked feverishly at the pain, trying to coat the inflamed orbs with whatever tears he had left. After a moment, he was able to wearily take in his surroundings.\n\nHe could see his breath in the dim light of his...room? The ceiling looked much like the floor felt underneath him. Cold, unforgiving, thrown together hastily yet somehow eons old. He stood with great effort and rubbed his watery, burning eyes. The barred door made this feel more like a cell. The crackling fire next to him begat lies of warmth and comfort. He looked where he had been lying: a thin leather mat and a bundle of hay as a pillow. Both were wet from where his body had been, and he realized now that though his skin, eyes, lungs, and everything about him felt dried out and paper-thin, his clothes were soaking wet.\n\nThere were other mats lying about the cell. None had bodies on them, or even remains. He was sure that at some point in the recent past the mats had been in use, but now they remained empty. This was just as well, he preferred to be alone. Or did he?\n\nNow that his wits were slowly coming back to him, he realized he didn't know much about himself. His name was Dei'Thuin, of course, he knew that. He couldn't remember much else. How he came to be in this cell, why his clothes were wet, who his parents were. This frightened him. With no memories, how was he even a person? Was it not the core of humanity that was made up of our past experiences? How would be press on? He was obviously alone here, with no immediate sounds of help or foo--\n\nDei'Thuin's existential melt down was interrupted by a little, high-pitched vocal chattering coming from the corner. There, near the fire, sat a brightly colored brown-orange monkey. Its tail was long and as it sat on its haunches he noticed it had a slightly withered appearance as if it hadn't eaten properly in a great deal of time. The monkey looked up at him, tilted its head to the right, barred its teeth in a wide smile and breathed heavily for a few seconds, not unlike a chimp, and then went back to poking at the very edges of still-burning fire.\n\nA contrasting light caught Dei'Thuin's eye near the door. It was blue, coming from a crystalline structure about waist-high. This, unlike the fire, was comforting. Its light reached deep into the room, almost outshining the fire from where he stood. It didn't pulse or flicker or scream for attention, all it did was shine a soft, calming blue. He took a few steps toward the door mindlessly, meaning to inspect the crystal.\n\nA great cacophony sounded to his left, and many people ran past holding weapons and torches. A woman stopped right in front of his cell. “Whoa there,” she said. She was a giant of a specimen, blonde-hair and armor-clad. “Are you alright?” She stared at Dei'Thuin for a moment expecting an answer. Just as he was about to speak, she continued, “The name's Lyris.”\n\nLyris took a sudden step back and heaved her ax high above her head. Dei'Thuin instinctively took a step back as she brought her weapon down on the lock to his cell door with a great groan, shattering it into a million pieces. “Hope you've still got some fight left in you, you're going to need it.” Though he didn't know much of anything about himself, he was positive that he was not the person to look a gift-horse in the mouth. He eagerly stepped through his newly-opened cell door.\n\nBeyond his previous confines he found a room lit primarily with a cold, blue glow coming from a far away wall. It looked as if some sort of horrible, jagged lamp hung from the ceiling and cradles a ball of blue fire in its claws. There wasn't much else to the cave, save for the dead bodies strewn about the floor. Lyris quickly moved to a fire on the other side of the room and knelt next to one of the bodies. “Dead”, she said somberly. “Must've been the runt of the litter.”\n\nDei'Thuin took a look and thought the body looked sizable enough to him, but he decided not to bring it up. She didn't seem like she had time for banter, much less him being a smart ass. She reached underneath the corpse, apparently looking for something, and Dei'Thuin noticed a large sword lying next to the body. He quickly snatched it up, though it admittedly didn't feel quite right in his hands. Much too heavy and slow. He could swing it, but he felt he would prefer a smaller, quickly weapon that could strike a touch more deftly.\n\nLyris stood and drew her ax again, “Keep your weapon ready and stay sharp. This place is full of surprises”. She spoke gravely and Dei'Thuin didn't particularly like the tone, but she was the only one here and she was suddenly running off so he decided to follow. The walls of the cave flew past them as they ran and he didn't catch sight of much. A couple more corpses and a ground-standing version of the metal-lamp he'd seen in the previous room, but as they entered another open room a flash of red light and smoke appeared out of nowhere directly in front of them. From this, as if stepping through a doorway, came a humanoid creature with horns wearing armor covered in spikes. It wielded its ax as if it meant to put someone in their place. His first impressions of the creature screamed “Guard” more than anything.\n\nLyris immediately attempted to lay into the creature, but it was nonplussed. He rebuffed her attacks and quickly turned its attention to Dei'Thuin. As it drew closer, time seemed to slow down and his instinct kicked in. He brought his giant sword up above his head and, in one great swing, brought it down squarely on the shoulder of the beast. His sword dug in and left a deep, unforgiving gouge as the horned thing fell off his blade into a dead slump on the floor. \n\n“Keep moving, there are more Daedra on the way,” spoke Lyris. She said this as if it were sport, hunting these Daedra beasts. More and more he was regretting following this woman, and he fully expected it to lead, somehow, to his ultimate demise. Still, now was not the time to question new friendships. He hurried after as she sprinted down the next hallway.\n\nThey entered a large chamber supported by multiple stone beams that were connected to the ceiling. On one side there was a great metal door that three small humanoid were busy trying to open. Dei'Thuin stopped, readying himself to help, when they spoke, “Don't stop now! Keep moving! More guards are on the way!” \n\nLyris chimed in as well, “Let's keep moving.” Not given much of a choice, Dei'Thuin sheathed his weapon and sprinted to catch up with the fleet-footed Lyris. As they took down the next hallway, he heard a familiar chattering. He looked behind him and saw that brown-orange, long-tailed monkey keeping pace with them, mouth grinning playfully. Dei'Thuin couldn't kept but show it a confused smile as he turned to keep running. \n\nShortly thereafter, another puff of smoke and light gave birth to an almost identical Daedra creature as before. This one, however, seemed to be prepared. It bolted for Dei'Thuin with its weapon held high and as it began to bring it down time slowed once more. Instinct-driven, Dei'Thuin threw his sword in front of his face, deflecting the blow and putting his foe off-kilter. He all but threw his sword across the room trying to slash at the monster and managed to fell it, once more, in one strike. Almost immediately after its body his the floor, however, another flash of light and smoke begat a different kind of horned-beast. This one wore robes and carried a staff with its tip aflame.\n\nIt took a moment to notice Dei'Thuin, but once it had the beast threw one hand to the side and starting wiggling its fingers as a pulsing, fiery glow grew between them. He didn't like the looks of that at all, and as time slowed again he shoved the flat of his sword against the Daedra and the fiery glow disappeared. Much as last time, though this time seeing his opportunity fully, he brought his sword in a horizontal arc and turned the creature into a bloody pile on the floor. He didn't relish in all this killing he was suddenly doing, but he'd be damned if he wasn't getting quite good at it.\n\n“Let's get out of here, my friend,” Lyris sighed. Friend is right, Dei'Thuin thought, I just saved your ass. They moved toward a door on the other side of the room and suddenly a shaft of light shot down from the ceiling. It brought a horrible, high-pitched ringing with it and turned into the glowing, purple, translucent outline of an old man. He bore a staff in one hand, a satchel strung across his body and was draped in old, tattered-looking robes. Lyris stopped in her tracks, “The prophet!”\n\n“Greetings, Vestige,” the ghostly old man lazily spoke. His voice was bellowing at times, other times soft and airy, and yet occasionally it bit like he was trying to spit the words out of his mouth before they had a chance to poison him. “Like you I am a prisoner in this place. You must rescue me and I, in turn, must rescue you.” This last bit rang with finality. Dei'Thuin didn't like that.\n\n“Hold a moment. Come here, we need to talk,” Lyris said. Dei'Thuin turned to her, confused and convinced that he might be hallucinating, or possibly dying. Either way they seemed safe so now was as good a time as any for some questions to be answered. Just as they settled in to talk, Dei'Thuin felt a tug on the leg of his rags. He looked down to see the monkey quickly scampering up his thigh and onto his shoulder. He went to shove it off, but the creature just moved to his other shoulder out of the way. He swatted again and was met with the same response. If he were healthier, maybe a little more hydrated, he would've done away with the beast. But the scrappy thing had grown on him, and seemed genuinely friendly, not to mention lively in a place riddled with such death. For now, he would keep the monkey. At least to see it back to the world of the living.\n\nHis aching, tired, dry mind was blazing with a thousand questions, but Lyris guided the conversation swiftly. She explained that they were in a place called Coldharbour, the home of those who had been sacrificed to the God-Deity Molag Bal. She told him he was dead. One would expect a revelation like this to rock a person to their core, but for Dei'Thuin it rang hollow. He'd been through so much just in the last 5 minutes that being dead hardly seemed like such a setback. They were revolting, and seemed to be making some decent headway anyhow. He had faith. Perhaps it would turn out misplaced, but it was there.\n\nHe, like many others, had been sacrificed in Molag Bal's name by a Worm Cult worshiping the Daedra. What stood now was only the remnants of his former self, which explained the memory loss but not the Great Drying. He supposed that would be a question for another time. For now they would need to free the Prophet from his prison, which was watched over by servants to Molag Bal called Sentinels. They shared a sort of hive mind, so damaging one would blind the others, which is good because Dei'Thuin didn't know how much more of this he had in him.\n\nThough he did not like the idea that he was getting wrapped up in some sort of Cosmic War, this was the life he was going to live now, at least for the foreseeable future. Who knew was was on the other side of that door? It could be his death, or possibly his salvation. He unsheathed his sword and, Lyris at his back, pushed the golden gateway open. There was only one way to find out.",

        "text": "Figured you might all enjoy a tale from my first time playing a construct character. Not sure what edition this is set in as it was a few years ago but i'll try and tell the stories as best I can! (As well as keep them short)\n\nI created a construct who was designed as a weapons testing dummy essentially. Omega. Strong, durable and fast but was pretty much a baby. Omega was designed as a teacher aide. You show him an overhead swing and he'll mimic it, that kind of thing.\n\nI wrote a small backstory (albeit some plot-holes at the level of his innocence) to how mhe met the existing party.\n\n--backstory--\n\nOmega had virtually no knowledge of what the world outside of the training camps were. He had great strength but didn't know how to use it and his only knowledge was how to swing a sword. When the camp he was training was attacked by marauders he didn't know what to do and fled. Omega wandered the forests for days until he found a small camp of adventurers. Hiding in the bushes he watched as they laughed and talked around a fire. Omega had only ever seen others at the camp and even then no one had tried to talk to him. As he sighed audibly the camp turned, the archer raised his bow and yelled.\n\n--start of roleplay--\n\n\"WHO GOES THERE.\" Omega panicked, he had seen archers before and knew the arrows could fire at range, he slowly raised from the bush timidly.\n\n\"What is that?\" the archer startled. The adventurers slowly grabbed their weapons and moved forward. Omega darted back behind the bush. Were these the bad guys who attacked the last camp?\n\n\"Settle your weapons down friends, you're scaring it.\" the old man at the back said, closing his book. \"If he were any danger we would be dead.\" he commented making his way to the bush.\n\nOmega saw the white haired old man kneel by the bush, \"Are you ok in there lad?\" he asked. Omega felt easier, about it and held his hand out. \"See harmless lads!\" the old man repeated.\n\nOmega stood up and brushed himself off, \"Cap..... tain?\" Omega asked nervously. The only interaction he had before this was saluting the captain of the camp when he was given a order.\nThe party looked shocked as the old man replied. \"Haha! He talks! Aren't you a special one! I am Grethor. We are friends, we have no captain or leader.\"\n\"Except gold.\" the bard spitted as he lifted the wine bag to his mouth.\n\nOmega looked around. \"Friends? No captain?\"\nThe party laughed. \"Now you're getting it son!\" Grethor replied. \"Come sit down with us and tell us your story.\"\nOmega slowly walked with Grethor to the fire. He looked around nervously as the party sat in awe staring at him.\n\nThey spent the evening trying to find out some more information about the construct. \"So what is your name?\" Grethor asked kindly. Omega slowly responded. \"It\" he looked to Grethor nervously for approval.\n\nGrethor scratched his beard, \"It?\" he replied, \"That's no name for something so magnificent as yourself my lad! Is that what they called you in the camp?\" Omega nods.\n\n\"Well what about that symbol on your hand? Do you know what it means?\" Omega never thought about it before, he shook his head. \"No.\"\n\nGrethor smiled, \"It's the symbol Omega lad.\" he paused, \"That's what we'll call you! Omega!\"\n\nThe party laughed in unison, omega didn't understand what was so funny but he threw in a laugh to feel comfy. \"So omega is friends with friends and Grethor?\"\n\nGrethor smiled, \"Yes lad. Omega is a friend to Grethor and his friends.\" as he patted Omega on the back.\n\n-- end of roleplay for the evening --\n\nI'll fast forward a bit to when we got into some of the action so to speak, the party learn that Omega was a training dummy who essentially would be taught how the enemy fights and would teach soldiers how to defend and fight back etc. He was still innocent to fighting though as he had never killed and would often use his strength without thinking in situations that would not call for it.\n\nOmega would also use his original purpose (As a movement clone of sorts) to learn new things. One situation had him trying to run on all fours to move faster (I needed a 19+ natural to learn this successfully) and he would often watch mages with fascination (Despite having a spell chance of 1) and had an extensive knowledge of spells based off his copying skills and learning the right tone words and gestures.... often ending in hilarity and mishaps.\n\nEventually the party made it to a town where they were meeting a brothel keeper who had a quest for them and how Omega learned a new spell.\n\n--inside brothel-\nGrethor approached the bloodstained bar before motioning for the party to stay behind him. \"Come with me lad.\" he motioned to Omega, \"Let's meet an old friend.\" Omega hadn't met anyone since he met the party. \"More friends?\" he asked with glee. The innocence of the construct brought a tear to grethors eye. \"Yes lad. More friends.\" he replied.\n\nBehind the bar was a short man with a heavy black beard and short hair. \"Grethor, you're late.\" he spoke with a gruff voice. \"Been keeping your beds free for a few days now. Lotta business coulda been had.\"\n\nGrethor didn't break his smile, \"My dear Arek, how delightful to see you again.\" Arek smiled seemingly putting his previous grimace aside, \"And you pal. Who's the new lad?\" he gestured at Omega with a hand. \"Name's Arek lad. Old pal of Grethor here. See he roped you into his adventure as well then?\"\n\nOmega nervously took the short mans hand, \"Omega.\" he said before looking nervously at Grethor, \"delightful to see you again.\" Grethor laughed before turning to the flabberghasted arek, \"Sorry Arek. Omega here is a one of a kind construct. Doesn't understand us fleshies.\" he said in jest, \"Do ya lad?\"\n\nOmega nervously looked between the men. \"Arek friends?\" he said to the short man. \"Omega is sorry about fleshy issue.\" he said nervously.\n\n\"Bahaha, poor sod doesn't know what to do with himself!\" Arek belted out in tears. \"Yeah we're friends pal.\" he replied, \"Shall I fetch the map for you then Grethor?\"\n\nGrethor took a more serious tone, \"Sounds a plan Arek. We'll set off come morning once we've planned a few things out.\" Arek nodded and moved to the other side of the bar behind the wall. \"Best be coming with me while i sort it. Don't wanna scare the customers do we?\" he said dryly.\n\nOmega and Grethor moved to the end of the bar with Arek before the short man begun moving his hands and reciting a chant. After a few seconds a small portal opened up and a skeletal hand clenching a bottle slowly arose from the portal. Arek snatched the bottle as the portal faded away.\n\nOmega stood in awe, \"More friends in portal?\" he asked Arek excitedly.\nArek laughed, \"Trust me pal, no one who is in there is a friend of anyone.\" as he turned to Grethor and began talking business.\n\nOmega sat examining the floor trying to see if the portal was magic or if it was a hidden room. He whispered to himself and moved his hands trying to not be noticed by the old men. (OOC at this point I got told to roll 3 dice. 20, 20 and 2) A blinding light illuminated the area as the portal was opened, skeletal riders clung to skeletal horses, nightmarish visions wailed through the room and screams filled the air.\n\nArek sprinted to Omega \"ENUK ENUK KUNETI\" he screamed as the portal closed around them. The bar stood in silence as everyone tried to come to terms with what just happened. Grethor began laughing, \"Sorry old boy! Forgot to say he was a copycat!\"\n\nArek began shouting at Omega berating him for his actions before realising Omega had no idea what he had done. \"Just don't do it again.\" he said sternly to Omega.\n\n---end of interesting stuff in encounter---\n\nIf anyone liked this i'll post more either in the comments or another thread.",

        "text": "So, I just returned from my first ever Encounters session at my local Game Empire (my first time playing 5e), and I've come away with a few fun moments I thought I'd share.\n\nWe were four players, seated at the overflow table. Our DM had only run a game once before. We are playing Princes of the Apocalypse. Everything went pretty smoothly.\n\nI play a Half-Elf Warlock with a Great Old One as a patron. There was also a Human Warlock whose patron was a fiend. There were also two Fighters - a defensive Dwarf and a greatsword-slinging Goliath.\n\nWe were on our way to investigate a ghost sighting, when we detected an ambush. I quickly began a trend of using my Awakened Mind feature and speaking abilities to derail things (in this case, their composure).\n\nAfter combat (we chased down and tied up the goblin to serve as a multipurpose tool), we entered a spooky cairn/crypt thing.\n\nInside, we were confronted by a specter, who told us to leave. I played the foreigner, and spoke to him in Sylvan. The DM countered by having him respond in kind, but I was able to get a better read on him for my efforts.\n\nWe feigned departure, long enough to witness him pass through a wall, then turned around and tried to test him by chucking the goblin at the wall he had entered, revealing a secret door into the burial chamber.\n\nThe specter appeared and attacked, and we tussled for a while (with the fighters growing frustrated at their ineffective attacks), before the Goliath decided to turn his sword on the coffin.\n\nAn animated sword appeared from within, then entered combat. The Dwarf hopped into the coffin and attacked the skeleton within, which then rose up and entered combat as well.\n\nThe Warlock squad took out the specter, but we were not having any luck with the sword or skeleton (who kept regenerating after each blow). Until - that is - I cast Dissonant Whispers on the sword. Though it passed the saving throw, half damage was enough to reveal our path. As the sword was damaged, so too did the skeleton suffer.\n\nOur objective now clear, we all turned out attacks on the sword. I won the killing blast, destroying it and inventing glitter at the same time. I collected the dust, a locket on a chain that belonged to the deceased, and some gold for my efforts.\n\nThe party then decided to try a short rest within the tomb, setting everything up as it had been before we entered to be safe.\n\nWe were shortly disturbed, however, by the voices of a few cultists, who clearly wanted to enter combat with us.\n\nStriking again with my new favorite feature ever, I rolled a Deception check with Awakened Mind, hoping to speak to their thoughts with the voice of the specter.\n\nI rolled a natural 20, completely derailing the planned combat the DM was hoping to spring on us. I (as the ghost-voice) commanded them to leave, and they did so.\n\nWe left the cave shortly thereafter, and the goblin attempted escape. He had been tied to the Goliath, and bit him on the arm to get away. This time, the natural 20 was against us, and he knocked the Goliath down to dying, before attempting to run away (the rope would have none of this, however, and he was knocked prone as the rope snapped taut).\n\nWe quickly killed the goblin for his treachery (we were originally planning on releasing him into the custody of the local constable back in town), and then watched as a pair of wolves appeared to drag away the body. However, the rope struck again, as they were not expecting the weight of our Goliath fighter on the other end.\n\nThey eventually snapped the rope and disappeared, and we were left confused, but overall victorious.\n\nAnd that is why I now know what I'll be doing on Thursday nights for the foreseeable future. :)",

        "text": "My name is Freck, master illusionist and high-ranking gnomish intelligence agent.  I was sent on assignment to investigate the primitive humans and report my findings back to the gnomish capital.\n\nI used to think humans were stupid.  For the most part I still do, but now I'm working with them to save the world.  I figured I had better write this down now, before the war starts, so that my brilliance will be preserved for future generations.\n\nThis story starts in a bar (because most good stories do) after a few too many drinks (another ingredient for a good time).  Somehow I had managed to bring a tame troll into the bar without the owner protesting.  I'm still not sure whether that was for fear of angering the troll or because of the handful of gold I laid down to get his attention, but my drinking companion and I were left alone for most of the night.\n\nAt this point I need to clarify something.  Back then, the humans didn't know gnomes existed.  We were fairy tales, legends.  Ever since our continent got blown to hell a few centuries ago we've been a little leery of making contact with the outside and stay hidden in our cities above the Boiling Sea.  With my stunning talents I had a glamour up that made me appear as a human almost as attractive as my true self.  The big reason I needed to explain this now is this: I, the cunning, handsome, disguised gnomish spy with a troll friend named Brunhilda, was NOT the strangest thing that walked into the bar that night.\n\nFirst, there was the big guy in the gilded armor.  It was obvious he'd never been in a bar before from the way he tried to walk in without touching anything.  His friend looked more comfortable, a soldier type wearing the colors of the human city Brecken.  They sat, ordered, and waited, casing the place like I was supposed to be doing.  Then a really big guy, a cinder block wall of a guy, walked in like he owned the place.  He had this sword strapped to his back that was almost as tall as he was.  If he had been any manlier he would have died from testosterone poisoning.  He and the other two noticed each other, and he sat with them.  Now, this doesn't sound remarkable just yet, just your standard meet-up for adventure or a drug deal.\n\nBut then there was the sheep.\n\nThe sheep had followed Mr. Bigsword in, while somehow evading the notice of half the bar.  This was strange enough in itself, but when Mr. Bigsword's steak arrived the sheep tried to make off with it.  Gnomes are not the kind of people that keep herd animals, but I was pretty sure sheep weren't carnivorous.  This was about the time the soldier noticed the sheep.  He snatched up the sheep with incredible strength and speed, which surprised the sheep so much he turned into a naked man.\n\nI graciously conjured some pants onto Naked Man, apparently convincing him that he could magically produce clothes in the process.  This had the whole bar's attention, but the festivities were interrupted when two half-dead town guards were thrown through the front door.  Some guy outside demanded Mr. Bigsword come out or blah, blah, blah something threatening.  At this point in the night I was pretty drunk, so I don't remember exactly what he said.  This sent the whole bar into a panic, and Golden Boy, Soldier, and Mr. Bigsword started interrogating the guards.  A quick illusion later and they were convinced that Mr. Bigsword had lopped the guy's head off trying to threaten him.  It was funny after a few drinks, but probably a dick move, I admit.\n\nNot long after this the guards turned into vampires.  The clever bastard outside had figured out a way around the whole \"having to be invited in\" thing when he threw these two bozos with bite marks in with us.  Naked Man turned into a wolf and went to town on one of their faces, and I managed to turn the busty barmaid invisible long enough for her to escape through the cellar.  My troll friend Brunhilda shoved me behind her to protect me.  This was nice but limited my field of view and led to me accidentally shooting Naked Man-Wolf in the ass.  Again, I was pretty drunk at this point.\n\nWe only finished off the first vampire after a struggle, and Brunhilda died going after the second.  The voice from outside made it clear we were going to have to leave the bar sooner or later when he lit the place on fire.  Soldier managed to sneak most of the rabble out of a window upstairs while the voice outside was rambling and we prepared for a fight.  At this point I think, \"Hey, vampires are afraid of holy shit, right?\" and disguise Golden Boy as an angel.  It wasn't much of a stretch.\n\nSo we charged out into the night, and a few of the vampire lackeys ran off at the sight of Golden Boy, but the boss didn't buy it.  He was tough, almost killing Golden Boy and Big Sword while they and Soldier took on his minions.  At this point I was out of bullets and ideas so I mostly watched from a distance.  The fight dragged on, and everyone was looking pretty ragged, when Naked Man-Wolf turned into Naked Man-Cow and kicked the boss vampire in the head, which dazed him long enough for the others to finish him off.\n\nThe five of us talked after the fight and figured we should check out the other vampire sightings up north, so I ended up with a lead and bodyguards out of the deal.  On the whole, not a bad night.\n\nAlso, it turned out Mr. Bigsword was the lost heir to the long-forgotten human empire or some shit, but more on that later.",

        "text": "I reiterate: Despite the batshit insanity which has resulted from the fastness and looseness with which I play as a DM, I regret nothing.\n\nBefore I begin Part 2, something worth mentioning: during the bullshit events of Part 1, our party's fighter (played by the shitbag who formerly played our druid) decided to roll to \"stop the madness.\" Fucker critically succeeds. Neither I nor anyone else in the party wanted to stop what had been set in motion, so we put our game faces on and set to work on a loophole. Fortunately, we managed to subvert his efforts thanks to circumstances of his own making; in the previous session, he had drawn from the Deck of Many Things and wound up imprisoned. As such, he was entirely unaware of the madness going on with the rest of the party and the interdimensional portal, and based on the MGIFB principle (Metagaming is for bitches) he could not roll to stop something he did not know was happening. However, he had critically succeeded, so some madness had to stop. I reasoned that in the context of being imprisoned somewhere by magical means, \"the madness\" for his character would refer to said imprisonment. Therefore, he was set free and returned to the party with his possessions restored.\n\nNow, on to the story for which this tale is named: the events which resulted in a god damn Greymarch and one player character death...sort of. After the Deadlands portal closed, the party continued to explore the dungeon, got up to some shenanigans. They met a disguised Rakshasa and managed to call his bullshit and kill him, then they encountered a group of something. Not important to the story what they were, point is the bard shot the Jakkawab at them twice simultaneously. He got the result whereby he was sucked into the Warp. The Warp is part of Warhammer 40K lore, basically an alternate dimension full of madness and super-demons. Bard's player knows this, knows it means certain death for a mortal. Being the most chill fucker since the god damn Buddha, he takes it in stride and hands me the character sheet. But he does point out that I need to roll for the second Jakkawab shot. I do so, and the result that comes up is: a piece of the cheese that was once Orcus (we turned the demon prince of the undead into cheese and blew him to pieces earlier) appears in front of you. Any who eat it gain the powers and responsibilities of Orcus. Everyone else was excited, but I ruled that since the wielder, the bard, was now in the Warp, it appeared in front of her there. Everyone's heart sinks, but then I meet the bard's player's eyes.\n\n\"Roll reflex.\"\n\nHis face lights up. He grabs a die and the entire party leans forward. He rolls a 17. I roll for the demons of the Warp coming to devour his soul. They get a 16. The bard reaches the cheese with moments to spare. As the Jakkawab's user, she alone knows what this cheese does. I ask the player, \"Do you eat the cheese?\"\n\n\"Uh, yeh.\"\n\nBard becomes the fucking Demon Princess of the Undead, overpowers the foul Warp-dwellers and rips open a portal back to the Abyss. The Abyss, due to previous madness, is currently being devastated by a perpetual meteor shower, so she can't stay long. I ask the bard/demigod, for his final act as this character before it becomes an NPC, where he would like the newly minted demon princess to go with the handful of his followers who have survived.\n\nNow, it's worth noting that for the past few days, the player had been telling me how he wanted to lead a Greymarch, kill the Mad God to restore balance in the universe, then kill the other Mad God (a lot of crazy shit happened) and claim his power. I repeatedly told him that this would not be possible.\n\nSo what does he do as one of the most powerful beings in the universe? He gathers an army of the undead from the Material Plane and goes off to the Nine Hells to find the secondary Mad God and kill him. He reasons that, as the heir of Orcus' power and responsibilities, the former bard would want to avenge the destruction of his realm, which had been brought about by the Mad God. I accept this reasoning, and Vice, Demon Princess of the Undead, marches her army on the Nine Hells to slay one of the mightiest gods in the universe. And what does she say as her armies amass before the gates of Hell?\n\n\"There will be a Greymarch!\"\n\nStay tuned for the bullshit finale of this fucked up session, Part 3: Oh Baby A Triple!",

        "text": "There's three stories here (sorry, but they're all so short...).\n\nSo I'm a huge fan of Betrayal at House on the Hill. I discovered the game two years ago with a group of my friends. The first two stories are from that summer; the last is from last summer.\n\nBy the time this story happened, we were so familiar with the game we'd memorized all the common haunts, so \"The Heir\" was familiar territory. Around that time, in part because I main Professor, was getting almost all of the Traitor roles. This was no exception.\n\nAt this point in the game, we'd revealed the Mystic Elevator and the goal. Unfortunately for me, there was no way to really protect the goal with assassins (open end). So I targeted the Mystic, the surrounding room, and a couple others. I wasn't sure which of two heroes would be their Heir, so I didn't immediately use any close ones or the Mystic one. I, of course, sprang the far away ones when they bumbled into them.\n\nFast forward a few turns. Now, I knew who it was, and he had the items he needed. He was coming towards the Mystic. He was low on health, and a lucky assassin could have killed him. It didn't. But now he was down to critical stats. Of course, he just needed to get a basement floor and I would lose.\n\nHe rolled for Mystic. 0. Roll for damage. 1. What I couldn't do, the Elevator had just done. GG.\n\nNow for the second story. It was a new one for us: the evil duplicate one. We had one guy on the verge of death. I had the music box. The pair of us raced his duplicate to the Mystic. And then it happened. He caught up to us. But then I realized: His sanity was one. He could NOT escape the music box. I felt bad for him, but I got both human and monster at once.\n\nFast forward a year, and to an all-nighter. It was 5 am, and two of us had to go at 8. Plenty of time for a Betrayal game. So we decided to add a twist: TWO traitors. Whichever won first got the victory, so they had to compete (and we'd pass on the second haunt if both were \"kill everyone\" haunts). Feeling good about this, we started. Half an hour later (we play fast), we got our haunts. Two hours later, we still hadn't finished working out the political situation. We didn't finish by 8, so I didn't see the end.",

        "author": "L-Hand-Suzuki-Method",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/32nznm/dd_35korvis_the_idiotic_sorcerer_and_the_virtue/",
        "text": "I had the pleasure, years ago, of playing D&amp;D with a group of mostly good people. And there was also Korvis.\n\nKorvis wasn't poorly designed. He had a selection of standard spells, some utility and some damage ones. He wasn't especially poorly written. He had a raven familiar and wore a hood with raven-feathers on it. Hell, that's just good branding. No, the main problem with Korvis was that he was as dumb as a sack of hammers dunked in a pot of boiling soup.\n\nIn the beginning of the campaign, he was a complete prick. He would never choose diplomacy, and constantly threaten NPCs. Not very smart for a level 1 sorcerer. Not a great idea to talk shit when you have 4HP and a party who's not supporting your actions. I can recall on TWO separate occasions when he used colour spray on an enemy who was in close combat with the party's fighter. The fighter was an agility-based dual wielder, so obviously he didn't have a lot of constitution. The first time it happened, it was a gamble, and an honest mistake. The second time, he was having tussle with several wights.\n\nThat was when the party remembered that undead are immune to mind-affecting spells.\n\nAfter they managed to cobble together the fighter's various squishy bits into a rough semblance of order (resulting in a lot of empty potion bottles and an exhausted cleric), the party decided that Korvis was no longer allowed to use Colour spray at any point during the game. Korvis plead that he had a limited spell selection as a sorcerer and that was his only non-lethal option to date. The party was largely unsympathetic. So Korvis went full-lethal.\n\nIn retrospect, this is maybe where things really started to go bad. Ever have a stupid magic user with no non-lethal spells? It ain't pretty.\n\nKorvis was a gambler. He shot through friendlies, noncombatants, rolled fireballs through flammable structures, and generally ran around the battlefield hooting and slapping his ass between acid and lightning bolts. He single-handedly lampooned several diplomatic discussions by filling his hand prematurely and “intimidating” the opposing diplomat by just maiming him a little. In his defense, it was hilarious the first couple of times. But he never crossed the line of seriously damaging a party member again. And the only other arcane caster was an entirely pacifistic wizard. He was a pain in the ass, but he was the heaviest puncher in the group, so the group dealt with it. Besides, they were making good progress in the campaign, so spirits were high.\n\nIt was when Korvis died the first time that we transitioned from being a prick to being a living legend.\n\nThe party had been trying to locate a certain person of interest for their employer ('employer' in this instance meaning the deranged evil wizard named Nicodemus who had bound them to his will and magically tattooed them to monitor them and inflict pain) for some time. The target is a legendary assassin. The party decides to split up for the day and gather some information – no combat, no aggression, just ask some questions. They were around level 4 or so right now, so even the squishiest of them should be able to run from a gang of thugs. The party was an odd number, so Korvis volunteered to be the group of one. Now, at this point, Korvis looked pretty scary. He had more raven feathers all over his outfit, and various trinkets and totems of a vaguely intimidating magical nature. He didn't look like the first target of a mugging. So the group agreed he would probably be fine alone.\n\nEverybody took different districts, and Korvis ended up walking in the industrial part of the city, looking around, asking some pointed questions, paying those who wouldn't talk without gold, and ominously waving his superfluous staff at those who needed a little intimidation. Eventually, he sits down to have a hot dog from a vendor cart, and a man sitting behind him says he's heard that Korvis is looking for someone. He invites Korvis to meet that someone that night, 8PM, at The Gilded Whore (The DM was bad at making up pub names). Korvis nods, and the nondescript man goes on his way. Korvis goes back to the Inn with the rest of the party for dinner… and doesn't mention the encounter to the party. Not a word.\n\nKorvis tells the DM he's gonna go alone to the meeting. He thinks the party's not taking him seriously enough, and he wants to handle this alone to show them he's not just some asshole who can only fling a fireball. The DM asks:\n\n“Are you sure?”\n\n“Yes.” Said Korvis.\n\n“That might not be a good idea...”\n\\\n“I'm doing it.”\n\n“I mean, the guy's a renowned assassin who doesn't want to be found… and you might have found him.”\n\n“I'm not scared of some coward who stabs people in the dark.”\n\n“...Are you sure?”\n\n“Yes, goddammit! I go there alone, and I tell nobody.”\n\nSo Korvis goes alone. The whole party is astounded by the singularly chowderheaded decision. Korvis gets to the bar, which is down a series of dark streets. Korvis doesn't give a shit, because “Ravens have no fear of the night.” Our eyes nearly rolled out of their sockets. The rest of the party sits back and gets the popcorn ready, because now they know he's fucked. Korvis goes to the bar, and sees the nondescript man from the hot dog stand. He informs Korvis that the assassin couldn't be here, but politely requests Korvis stop looking for him. Korvis does not agree to this, and indignantly leaves, walking out the front door. He takes no defensive measures of any sort. Mage armour? No. Shield? No. Remember, he ONLY has lethal spells. So he just turns his back on a room full of pissed off hired killers and walks away, arms-a-pumping. I guess it didn't matter that he turned his back to them, because he got shot in the chest. By four arrows. Simultaneously.\n\nEver heard of the spell Arrow split? Turns one arrow into d4 arrows, if I remember correctly. Does standard arrow damage, but they can all hit.\n\nKorvis fails 4 reflex checks.\n\nKorvis wears cloth armour.\n\nKorvis is a level 4 sorcerer.\n\nKorvis took CON as a dump stat.\n\nThat amounts to four “fucks” and one dead damn bird mage. He's taken to negative fourteen HP. This means he is dead. No save.\n\nKorvis asks the DM if he can say something as he dies. The DM decides to show mercy, and says “You can have one word.” Korvis knows what it is.\n\n“NICODEMUS!”\n\nRemember those magic tattoos that I mentioned? They're like two-way radios. Nicodemus would hear it, especially if asked for by name. So, pop quiz, hotshot. You're a big, evil wizard man who has to bind cronies to your will constantly to get any work done, and they've resisted you every step of the way. Then, suddenly? The bloodthirsty idiotic sorcerer asks you for a deathbed favour. What's your play? Because Nicodemus' was to cast a teleportation spell, cast time stop, do a little jig, grab the stupid raven-bedecked moron, and pull him into his own private pocket dimension for a little meatball surgery.\n\nNow, as Korvis is deader than disco, he can't just heal him. Reanimate dead won't work, because Korvis' heart looks a bit like a meaty spaghetti strainer. But you know what necromantic spell Nicodemus has access to? Trap Soul. So he sucks Korvis into a geode or something and preserves the body. The party has to do without Korvis for a little while until the “repairs” are complete (the party noted the use of language, here).\n\nSo, the party tracks down the assassin and finally takes him down, because now they have an amount of people that about equals the challenge rating of the fight. A week passes, and Korvis is returned to them. Most of him, anyways.\n\nThe solution that Nicodemus went for was to cram a soul-gem into Korvis' old body, after patching it up a bit and outfitting it with some magical veins. Essentially, Korvis is a shittier, magical Iron-man, who smells vaguely of rot. He's like an undead who can still be affected by colour spray and has to always wear a hood lest villagers try to burn him to death just a little. And moves slower. All in all a series of nasty debuffs, but hey. He was at least immune to pain. Not in any way immune to Nicodemus' thrall, though.\n\nThe campaign continues, and Korvis mostly avoids talking to NPCs. It was probably best. Eventually, the group's fighting their way through a colony of giant , sapient ants. One of them chops off Korvis' gangrenous head, which funnily enough doesn't kill him at this point. Why would it? His mind is in his soul gem, in his chest. It does blind him, though, as his gem's not wired to any eyes. During the combat, Korvis feels around until he finds something head-shaped and puts it on his shoulders. A few seconds pass, the magic wires in his body find the optic nerve, and the lights come back on. Several hundred of them. At different angles. Korvis' vision seems oddly segmented. He goes to say something,  and makes an odd chittering noise. Finally Korvis realizes what the rest of the group has been watching in horror. He's put on the head of one of the ant-men. What's worse, he likes it. Says it looks badass.\n\nSo now he's a shitty, rotting magical Iron man with a giant ant head. Who later rode a giant crocodile like it was Falcor from The Neverending story. For a moment.\n\nThe campaign continued to progress, and Korvis, never one to be kept down, managed to continually irritate the party right until the final confrontation. The party's shaken his thrall and seeks to destroy him… or die trying. That old chestnut.\n\nWhen finally they get to Nicodemus, they realize that he's a full-blown Lich. And they've searched every inch of this pocket dimension, and his Phylactery isn't here. Nicodemus cackled.\n\n“You fools… I put it in the safest place in the world. You safeguarded it this whole time, for me.”\n\nThe party turns as one to gape at Korvis' chest-bulb. Nicodemus had made Korvis' soul gem his phylactery, tying his life to Korvis'. It was like a shitty Dragonheart kinda deal. \n\n“Now you are faced with a choice… you can either let me live and depart, or take the life of one of your own com--” The last word was probably going to be “companions,” but we'll never know, because the Wizard shot a disintegration spell at the soul gem, mid-monologue. He had learned exactly ONE offensive spell.\n\nKnow what kind of damage disintegration does to objects? Fucking massive, that's what kind.\n\n Nicodemus had failed to account for the fact that Korvis was an irritating shit and the party wouldn't be especially sad to see him go. His last words weren't an otherworldly shriek, they weren't a threat of vengeance, and they weren't “NOOOOO!” Nicodemus' last words were the same as Korvis':\n\n“Oh.”\n\nOh, and Korvis didn't know this beforehand. He got to sit and watch as everyone else escaped the now self-destructing dungeon (Nicodemus was your standard load-bearing villain), regain their freedom, and wrap up their post-campaign rewards and story elements. And when it was all said and done, the DM turned to the now-silent player of Korvis, and said:\n\n“And THAT is why if the DM asks you 'Are you sure?' that many times, the answer is 'no.'”\n\nIt was a good lesson for the group against wanton and flagrant stupidity.",

        "text": "After getting through the beginning of this part of the adventure tonight, I feel a powerful urge to tell the story. While we're running HotDQ out of the book, the DM is making quite a few alterations (both by using the bonds generated from the back of the book and the trinkets we roll to start with or find in the game), as well as some slightly different encounters to keep us on our toes and make things more interesting. The characters in this telling are:\n\n&gt;Lex Tolinus, the Dragonslayer: Responsible for scaring off the dragon Lennithon from Greenest and defeating Cyanwrath, the Cult of the Dragon's champion, in single combat there. A half-Drow arcane trickster rogue with an ego even bigger than his accomplishments would suggest. The \"leader,\" or so various NPCs believe.\n\n&gt;Diana Rhine, Sword of Bahamut: A paladin from a noble family, trained by an enemy of the Cult of the Dragon and sent to investigate them, her arrogance has been tested more than once as fate seems out to get her. Her belief in the providence of her mission and the competence in herself and her companions is more than enough to get her through, however.\n\n&gt;Skoras al'Jira, the Shrouded Surgeon: Little is known about the tiefling cleric, other than his professed faith in Kelemvor, noble judge of the dead. The adventurers found him under attack by cultists and kobolds and rescued him, adding his prophetic auguries and blade to their own cause. His fascination with the dead has caused unspoken tension, however. A strange book he bears allows him to raise the dead, though they owe his allies no loyalty.\n\n&gt;Arroc, the Turncoat Captain: A former captain of the Cult of the Dragon, Arroc was captured during the raid in Greenest by the village's saviors and offered to betray his fellow cultists by leading the heroes to the nearby encampment. Though most of the group doesn't trust him, he has been given the right of freedom, and chosen to stand by their side, at least for the immediate profits and lack of imprisonment while he does so.\n\n&gt;Tim, the Late Prophet: A prisoner of the cultists, Tim was rescued at the same time the heroes found Leosin, a monk investigating the cult. He told the governor of Greenest that he had foreseen fire and destruction visited upon the village, and was informed he was somewhat late in his warnings, having arrived days after the raid. He accompanies the group for his own indecipherable reasons.\n\n&gt;Baltazar Whiteeye, Bahamut's Bulwark: Once a tribesman in the far north and a deserter of a grand army, Bahamut found peace amongst a monastery to the Platinum Dragon, and used his knowledge of war to serve the god of justice and honor. He is the first to preach of providence and keeping faith, and trusts all of the group to accomplish great things.\n\n#\n\nWhile Tim, Skoras, and Lex circle around above the entrance to the hatchery, Baltazar, Diana, and Arroc enact their part of the plan as the vanguard and attract the attention of the guards across the cliffs. While the two faithful of Bahamut strike down kobolds and ambush drakes, Arroc goes missing, and the other group presses the attack at the cave’s mouth.\n\nOne of the guards there cuts his own throat, and his blood begins to boil and coalesce into tentacles that grapple Skoras, pulling him into the seething liquid. The three members of the strike team see another guard within the cave, kneeling in prayer and chanting as the pool of blood expands and sinks, turning the ground around the body into a broiling mire of blood. Skoras struggles to escape and strike at the chanting cultist, but grows weaker and sinks deeper the longer he remains within. He finally escapes, pale from loss of blood, while Lex and Tim kill the chanter, ending the blood magic and the battle at the cave’s mouth.\n\nMeanwhile, Diana and Baltazar have made a game of the vanguard duties, racing to see who can strike down the most foes and exchanging banter the whole time. When they run out of foes, Diana goes to join the others, while Baltazar remains behind a few minutes longer, concerned about Arroc. He finds several dead ambush drakes outside of the camp’s gates, already dead, but not harmed by any weapon.\n\nSkoras rests on the cliff a moment while Lex and Tim enter the hatchery. Arroc comes up behind them, wounded and bleeding, but reporting the victory of the vanguard. Diana arrives as well, with Baltazar bringing up the rear. By the time the dragonborn shows up and congratulates Arroc (on a job the others did not ask about), Lex has gone ahead to scout the cave mouth. Baltazar lights his incense and heals the others of their wounds, and the group enters the hatchery.\n\nLex points out a staircase that, to the untrained eye, blends perfectly with the cave walls, and warns against a trapped step. The group discovers giant mushrooms; Skoras identifies the purple ones (which take up one side of the cavern) as dangerous, and leads the group through them safely. When they reach a crossroads, Lex guides them down a path with his glowing gemstone (which, to all the others, is still just a chunk of coal). They begin to see signs of light down the tunnel, and hear a voice in Draconic that Lex and Baltazar recognize as Cyanwrath, the half-dragon champion of the raiders of Greenest. Lex goes ahead to scout out the room, discovering it as a massive temple to Tiamat, carved out of the natural cave. Cyanwrath discovers the Dragonslayer, and bellows a challenge, while the cultist guards and kobolds present stand down, not wishing to anger their master.\n\nLex is ready, however, and launches his gemstone (with no small amount of providence) directly into Cyanwrath’s open maw, causing the half-dragon discomfort that he repays with two quick slashes of his greatsword. The smell of ozone fills the chamber as the party files in; they are warned that if they interfere in any way, the guards will enter the fray as well, and likely kill Lex. They are forced to watch as Cyanwrath prepares to bring his wrath down on the Dragonslayer, ending his grudge once and for all.\n\nBut he is undone by the gemstone. Instead of meeting the same end as his childhood friend Kate, Lex is saved by a miracle, as the destructive energy of Cyanwrath’s lightning breath backfires, electrocuting him into submission, as well as killing a nearby guard and lashing out at Skoras and Diana (who are thankfully unharmed). Lex approaches the fallen champion and slits his throat to recover the stone; Cyanwrath, conscious enough to recognize he has been defeated, does not fight back or beg, but accepts death with honor. Baltazar stands over the fallen champion’s body and takes up his greatsword.\n\nThe guards flee, dropping their weapons and armor. Skoras kills one before the man can escape, however, and uses his entrails as the focus for an augury, learning that there is a horrible trap within the room, centered on an ornate chest in front of the shrine to Tiamat. Tim notices the carvings of dragons (which primarily resemble black dragons) have holes in their mouths that line up with the treasure, and Lex finds a pressure plate underneath it, set to trigger if the chest is moved or lifted. Inside, they find a wealth of gems and jewelry, most of which belongs to the people of Greenest. Lex stashes it in his sack, with Diana’s reminders that they should be returned to their proper owners. While warned by Skoras not to touch the chest, Lex attempts to remove the ornate inlay from the chest. When he pushes it off the plate, there is a click and an ominous hiss from the mouths of the statues.",

        "text": "The Dreamsea had tested me and I prevailed. Washed up on my home shore I confidently lead my fellow travellers into the smuggler's cove. The Cove was the only way to get back to civilization, short of climbing up some sheer rock cliffs.  \nA small stream gave away the cove and we entered the rock where the stream exited, inside was a small jetty, an overturned rowboat and a skeleton clutching a sword in one hand and a note in the other, slumped against a rotting post upon the jetty.    \n\"Stand back\" I said with an air of confidence, as I drew my rapier from my belt and eyed the onlookers. I turned my full attention to the skeleton and drove my rapier into it's chest, where it's heart would be if it was alive. The rapier blade cut into it's ribs and planted itself into it's spine. The Skeleton jolted with the impact and collapsed.  \n\"Ah... guess this isn't one of those ones that comes to life then.\" I murmured and put my rapier away. Cass, the half elven entertainer, bent down to pick up the note and read it. Explaining it was some sort of apology letter to the deceased's wife about being stabbed and not making it home, the skeleton was also wearing a small key, about it's ragged clothes. I compared the key to my own that I wear around my neck, it is a strange key I found at sea and I do not know what it unlocks. The skeleton's key had no resemblance and Cass pocketed it.  \n  \nKaiden dipped his feet into the water and then went in after them... investigating the overturned boat. He lifted the vessel and looked underneath. That's when some of the most manic crabs I've ever seen came shooting forth from the shifting sands about the boat and they must have caught him by surprise as he dropped the boat onto himself, trapping himself underneath it.  \nThe crabs however were outside the boat and turned their attention on us. They seemed to hunt by movement, a point I couldn't quite get across to my companions during all the panic. I stood atop the wooden jetty and assisted by skewering a few of the crustaceans as and when I could. Luna did not fare well against these non-humanoid targets and they crawled about her, pinching and snapping, they drove her to the floor and were about to eat when Aggarak made crab paste with his hammer, and bound her wounds with his healing magic.  \n\nAfter the chaos and the Halfling escaping his underwater coffin we took stock of the room and noticed a rope leading to a hole in the ceiling, in a dark, damp corner. The rope snapped under the weight of the halfling so we tied one of our own ropes to him and he climbed up and replaced the rope, allowing us to climb up with ease.\n\nWe walked down a twisting corridor and came to a room with a large table, like a meeting room, at the end of the table a spirit sat, immobile. The spirit locked in on us when we entered the room and boomed in a voice louder than mundane shouting. “WHO DARES TRESPASS IN MY DOMAIN!?”  \nResponding to this question I step forward, torch in hand and yell back; “Captain Vash Weston, the man who will become Pirate King!”.  \nAlthough looking back it may have been more rhetorical than I realised at the time. Six skeletons raised up from the table and began to attack us, after waving my torch in the skeleton’s face my comrade Thal’galan destroyed the thing’s skull and it collapsed. When it started to pull itself together I bravely ran through them, [over the table](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgWJUKzgvR4), leaving Thal’galan heroically surrounded as I waved my torch at the Spirit. Luna, my mute elven companion understood and shot the spirit with arrows which I don’t understand but I’m not complaining. Eventually everyone realised and we’d disrupted the spirit enough to move it onto the next world. Behind his seat there were a couple chests worth of coin and assorted useful tat like scrolls, artwork, gems and silver chalices. I played a quick diddy and summoned up an invisible servant to carry the coin chest, then led my fellow ransackers into the light.\n\nUpon leaving I spied that we were merely a few stone’s throws from the Spyglass Inn and it was late. I suggested we drink, sleep, eat and then depart for Shine in the morning, as it was a few hours travel and the roads are less safe at night. My drinking buddies seemed a little parched and as such we rented a room for the evening and then spent as long as possible avoiding actually going to it in the Bar.  \n  \n[Part 2 - Mutiny!](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3241tw/dd_5e_the_singing_pirate_mutiny/)",

        "text": "I'll preface this story with the disclaimer that I play it fast and loose with the rules as a DM. I let my players get away with a lot of shit, and I have a policy wherein the players roll for everything, even if it's silly, and if they critically succeed, whatever they're attempting goes horribly right. This policy tends to result in the sort of events recounted herein. Know that I regret nothing.\n\nFirstly, I'll address why the title of this tale includes Deadlands, when the events took place during a D&amp;D session. In my last post, I mentioned how I had the party find the Jakkawab, an artifact with powers of utter fucking madness on par with the Wabbajack, with its own table of crazy effects. First door the party opens leads to a dining hall, guarded for some fucking reason by two mummies and a mummy lord. Well below the party's level, I didn't expect these guys to be more than a speed bump. But the bard decides to shoot the lord with the Jakkawab. I roll on the table, and it opens an interdimensional portal to the Deadlands: Hell on Earth universe. I'd added that result to the table at the request of the sorcerer's player, who was the Marshal of that Deadlands campaign. As foul air spilled through the portal, we rolled to determine which of a few possible locations in the HoE setting the portal might open on to; as it happened, it opened up right next to the majority of our party. Then the bard fired the Jakkawab again.\n\nThis time, the result was that everyone within twenty feet of the target swapped memories at random. The immediate reaction of the players was panic; were they within twenty feet? Was their shit about to get ruined? I pulled out my map of the dungeon and started frantically counting grid squares. Lo and behold, they were safe. But this portal between universes...it did not account for distances. All of the player characters from the Deadlands campaign (except, ironically, mine) were caught in the blast radius. Counting the three mummies and a couple NPCs, there were eight people affected. The couple of the group, our ace driver and petite LMG user, both ended up in the bodies of mummies, one mummy switched with another mummy, essentially unchanged, our old man ended up in the young woman's body, the NPC who hired our group wound up in the body of our driver, a random guard outside got the boss's body, and mummies wound up in the old man and the guard. All this bullshit destablized the portal and sucked the mummies through, along with the dining table, into the Deadlands world before closing. The sorcerer's player has said that the madness of this event had one additional side effect: a pistol appeared in the Deadlands world, with only three chambers in the revolving barrel. Each shell casing is engraved with a face, howling in madness.\n\nMy players' characters in the D&amp;D world will never know what happened to those mummies, or where that portal led to. Most of the players in the Deadlands campaign aren't even aware of my D&amp;D campaign, and we aren't going to tell them. Next Deadlands session will be interesting, I expect. Meanwhile, we decided that what we had done, devastating the plot of a campaign in a completely different RPG, couldn't be charted on the Henderson Scale of Plot Derailment. And so we made our own scale, named after the bard who initiated the event: The Blackbard Scale of Remote Derailment.\n\nAs great as all of that was, the best part is this: it all took place within the first hour of the session. Be on the lookout for Part 2: And There Will Be a Greymarch.",

        "text": "When I was younger, I used to go to a larping camp that went by the name “Renaissance Adventures.” It was a fantastic place that gave me my love of fantasy, and set me on the path to other tabletop RPGs like D&amp;D.  \n\nThe camp was awesome, but the rule system was easily exploitable. Since the camp drew in many kids that had a knack for science and math, the results were some very creative bending of the rules. This tale is a second hand account of one of the most legendary exploits in the history of the camp, which forever changed the way that magic worked in the game. \n\n It was lunchtime, sometime in the middle of the summer, and raining. Because of the weather, all of the campers have been confined to a small shelter in the middle of the park. The space was too small to actually sword fight and all of the quest leaders( camp’s equivalent to DMs) were on lunch break, so there is nothing to do. In order to stave off boredom, one kid was reading the camp’s rule book and came across an intriguing discovery about one of the spells in the game: move element.  \n\n It’s a simple spell that moves up to a cubic foot of any particular substance that is of the mage’s element (either earth, water, fire, air, ect) at up to 1 mph. But, the kid found a detail about the spell, the speed at which you could move the cube could be affected by multicasting. \n\n  RA had a stupid rule regarding if you multicast spells. If you cast multiple instances of a spell on the same target, then it doubled the effect of the spell. Since the rules said that speed was also affected, after just four instances of the spell the cube would be 256ft^3 and travel at up to 256 mph. Since air resistance was never mentioned in the rules, the only factor that restricted the speed was how many times it was cast. In that particular group there were six kids, who could cast the spell up to four times per day, so let that sink in for ya.\n\nThe exploit was quickly conveyed to the kids comrades, and his companions added to the bullshit idea. Another camper had a skill that allowed him to store dormant spells in an artifact(in this case a small stick) and unleash all the instances at will. Now there there would technically be no limit on how many times the spell could be cast( granted they would have to wait a full day after casting 24 instances of the spell into the artifact). They had, in effect, created a small tree branch that could launch supersonic mountains at whatever they wanted. \n\nThe kids laughed at creating an infinite speed cannon as the thunder outside continued, foreshadowing their evil scheme. But one of the kids piped up, they couldn't make something go at infinite speed because of physics.\n\nQuick crash course: as something approaches the speed of light( 670,616,629 mph), it gains mass. In order to even go the speed of light you would need an infinite amount of energy to push that mass. \n\nThe group divided into two sides: physics loyalists, and magic bullshiters . The bullshiters argued that the words “up to” in the rules meant that they could transcend the barrier, and that the universe that the camp took place in must have different laws of physics due to the magic. The loyalists argued that everything as we would know it would break down if that barrier didn't exist, and thus the universe must at least have the barrier as one of the laws of physics within the universe. \n\nThe argument continued, and the group finally decided that there was only one way to solve this problem. They went to the oldest quest leader at the camp and the writer of the games rule book, who will be called Steve. \n\nAnd thus a bunch of kids, many of their ages having not reached double digits yet, began to talk to a grown man about physics.\n\nThe conversation went something like this:\n\nKids- “ Hey Steve is the speed of light a constant in your universe?”   \n\nSteve- “.................................What?”\n\nKids- “ Are things incapable of going faster than light?”\n\nSteve- “...........uh..................I think so.............”\n\n(Bullshiters look disappointed while Loylaists look smug)\n\nOne Loyalist- “Well, as we keep casting the size will increase, so we could try to see how big we could make that.”\n\nSteve- “What are you guys working on.”\n\n(kids explain the nearly lightspeed mountain spell)\n\nSteve- “.....................No. I need to fix that.”\n\nThus Steve changed the rules about multicasting the speed of move element, but the group basically repeated the same shenanigans on countless other spells, and Steve had to remove the entire concept of multicasting from the rules.\n     \nTL;DR- preteens figure out how to make shit go really fucking fast.\n\nThanks for reading my first gametale. \n\nIf you have any feedback that could help me improve my writing it would be much appreciated.

So one day this one individual decides that, as his group is traveling through the woods he is going to go fight a bear. I, before starting this campaign, tell one of my friends said if anyone devices to fight a bear or something that is going to run into a Werebear or a dire bear.  So this guy sits there and says he is going to go out and fight a bear so I just an act my contingency plan and I send them up against a Werebear. He gets his ass handed to him and proceeds to sulk for like the next 10 minutes or so until they get to the next town. It is largely populated by orcs but for some reason he decides that he is going to start a fight in the tavern. Beforehand I had set up this huge ass table from 1 to 20 of things that he would potentially run into if someone decided to do so because I knew they were going to do this I set it up as one being they don't find anything to they find something really weak 2 something a little bit stronger so on and so forth until 20 when they really run into something they abso-fucking-lutely cannot handle. I roll a 20. He elects to start a fight with a large gang of orcs. They are all lower level but there's like 8 of them against him and they aren't much lower. I say to him, \"you could probably run away or goad them into fighting you one at a time. \" he tells me that this is the only way to gain the respect of an gang of Orcs is to fight them all at once. One of them grapples him and in 5 e you get an advantage to trying to hit someone who is being grappled. Long story short he gets his ass handed to him again and proceed sulk some more.",

        "text": "So there we were, enjoying drinks and meals in a friendly enough, if slightly run down tavern, as D&amp;D parties are so very wont to do. Myself--a blind child necromancer, her adoptive elder brother a hearty Dragonborn, their traveling retainers and his squire, and the rest of our eventual party at their respective tables. As you'd probably expect, things don't stay quiet for long, and an unexpected vampire attack leads to a shattered tavern door and a surprisingly challenging fight on the lawn outside. The outcome? An entire pack of slain wolves, one vampire eventually on the run, and a whole lot of injuries for the party being nursed.\n\nUpon returning to the tavern to lick our wounds, however, things seem off. Very off. Will saves are made all around, upon which we discover the tavern is ruined, decrepit, unused in years, and the charred corpse of the barkeep is still rotting and burnt in his place behind the counter. The food? Moldy, musty, you name it. The drink? Flat, warm piss-ale. Needless to say the party is horrified, especially upon discovering that a Haunt, more or less, has sprung up around the tavern, having built the illusion in the first place. Not the spirit of the barkeep, however, but the spirit of the tavern itself.\n\nDuring much of the ensuing discussion and flight back into the lawn outside, our two more aggressive companions argue back and forth about simply burning the building to the ground, destroying the spirit, and so on. It takes the necromancer some time to even grasp that the cause of the issue is an undead spirit, but once she does, she takes charge. Communing with the tavern, she discovers that the barkeep had fallen asleep one night, the tavern on a rather secluded path that didn't see much business. Knocking over a candle or torch, the tavern went up in flames, leading to the remains of its proprietor and the burnt out husk we'd been deluded by. Naturally, the necromancer is less than pleased about the idea of *burning the building down*, for fear of enraging the angry spirit even further. With more communication, she discovered the tavern had merely wanted to continue its purpose aiding weary travelers, even if that meant feeding them rotted food and stale drink. When the vampire attack had broken the door, the spirit's own delusions had been shattered, and it was reminded of its actual current state, sending it into a frenzy.\n\nDetermined to lay the spirit to rest instead of simply burning the place down or otherwise destroying it, the necromancer laid out a Magic Circle and urged the party to find anything un-ruined by the fire. The spirit would, she theorized, be coerced by her into an undamaged vessel that still bore a strong imprint of the tavern, even something as simple as a coaster with the tavern's logo emblazoned on it. That being done, the group could then burn down the tavern to prevent future guests from being caught in its web, while the spirit is bound to the one remaining remnant from its glory days. \n\nWith the party finding an undamaged stein, the ritual commenced. After some back and forth Religion and Arcana checks and saves against possession of *herself*, the spirit was successfully contained within the stein, the necromancer bound the Magic Circle around the container itself instead of the ritual area, and the building was free to be demolished. BUT, surprise of surprises, the stein became a magical item for our dear blind necromancer!\n\nA magical item fully rolled off of random charts, and yet so wonderfully appropriate. Reasonably enough, the now-sentient stein communicated telepathically, via emotion, mostly. Appropriate for a spirit, sure. However, the stein also is possessed--no pun intended--of bouts of belligerence, whimsy, and emotes *very loudly*. With a preference for alcohol. It also has an Aspiration and Goal, which, of course...remains being the perfect Tavern. It also has bouts of being argumentative and a tendency to encourage fights. So, the stein spirit rescued from a tavern is a loud, belligerent drunk that encourages getting into spirited tavern brawls. But that's not all! Our blind young wizard's spirit also is possessed of a pair of spells that basically, used together, replicate Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion--allowing, once per day, the interplanar creation of the spirit's tavern, as seen in perfect condition in its heyday. The *only* negative roll of this particular girl's sudden amazingly perfect spirit?\n\n...If you are more than ten feet away from it, it causes blindness.\n\n",

        "text": "[The buster squad was experiencing some down-time](http://redd.it/314rwc). [Pratena the punchy cyclops, Thoth the shabti magus, and Barrel the halfling rogue](http://imgur.com/a/4xfYd) were all enjoying a brief period of peace and quiet before the next mission came in, and relaxing in the meantime. They had earned it.\n\nWell, not Rose the dullahan ranger. She hated down-time. Her fleshy comrades could get tired, but she couldn’t. She didn’t even need to sleep. And at 3 in the morning, nobody was keen on her working the forge, her only pastime. So she stood, waited for dawn, and pondered things like her recent past. A lot of stuff had happened to her recently, and she had plenty of time to dwell on what might have gone wrong. It wasn’t fair. She should be doing something, ANYTHING, not just standing around and waiting for the next thing to happen to her.\n\nFar in the distance, she heard the train whistle. It was too much.\n\nPratena woke up swinging, her panicked punches slamming into whatever objects were closest- this turned out to be her snack fridge and the supports of her bed. Thoth had cannoned out of his clothy tomb and promptly tripped into the more traditional stone one he had brought up from the basement. Barrel had panicked, knocked over his bedded laundry basket, and was now frantically trying to get himself upright. No creature deserves to be woken up at 3:00 AM by an angry dullahan screaming “I WANT TO STEAL A TRAIN!”\n\n**THE BUSTER SQUAD IN: THE PAIN TRAIN**\n\nOnce things had settled down, a convincing argument was made for why this particular heist should happen- One, the train was crazy valuable, Two, it was in the hands of an unpleasant fascist government, Three, it was carrying a lot of awesome cargo, and Four, TRAINS ARE SO FUCKING COOL OH MY GOD I WANT ONE. This was all the flimsy moral justification the party needed to go gallivanting off and wreck the shit of the moderately nefarious Gnome Hitler and his midget Not-Nazis.\n\nNow, the party came up with several plans to get to the train- illusions and disguises, sabotaging the tracks, insta-growing a tree in some important bit, and even having Thoth lie on the tracks and force punch it off the rails as it went over (which Pratena objected to, as she could punch a hell of a lot harder- this started a long, heated, and ultimately pointless debate). Finally, things were agreed upon- the party would grab the train in transit, with a minimum of civilian casualties and damage to the engine.\n\nIn order to do this, they had to sweet talk some very warlike orcs. Things started on a fairly positive note when said orcs charged the party on sight, brandishing weapons and screaming in the traditional orc greeting. Thankfully, Pratena and her orcy nature managed to talk them down by suggesting (using very small words) that there could be a lot MORE violence, bloodshed and glory in the name of the almighty war-god if they were to assist in the capture of the train with all the shooty-sticks inside. The orcs agreed, on the condition that the orcs would get all the cars and the party would get the engine.\n\nWith that, things were sorted and the party prepared to board... by teleporting from a dead standstill into the cabin of a train (which they couldn't see), that was also moving at 100 kilometers per hour. Luckily they had the foresight to cast feather fall beforehand.\n\nAnd that was how the party slammed face-first into Gnome Hitler and his own personal M1 Abrams tank. Awkward.\n\nA lot of german screaming later, Barrel rushed into the engine to slow the damn train down while soldiers started erupting from the previous car. Gnome Hitler tried to make a run for the tank, but Pratena grabbed him in her vice-like grip and started squeezing him like a stress toy. Attempts to shut him up were interrupted by an impressive volley of gunfire from the incoming soldiers, who apparently didn't know (or perhaps care) that their leader was in the line of fire. Oh, and backing them up were about four clockwork soldiers, rushing in to tank hits and lend assistance with their freakishly large strength and damage reduction.\n\nIt was a bit of a tight situation, but the party rallied magnificently. Thoth went on construct duty, flashing through them with his storm step (but failing to dodge the retaliatory spear stabs), keeping them off the rest of the group. Pratena and Rose were furiously trying to stop the gnome army from getting into the tank, using the now-unconscious Das Fuhrer as a bullet-shield while they tried not to get shot to pieces. When this didn't quite go as planned, Rose used one of her spells that she had prepared for just this occasion- Jam Barrel. As the last of the soldiers disappeared down the hatch, they aimed their mounted guns straight at Rose, and... *click*. It's beautiful sound to hear when you're at less than 20 hit points.\n\nMeanwhile, Barrel had successfully wrangled the train down to a pace where the orc horde was speedy enough to jump on and give the remaining soldiers some trouble. Unfortunately, the clockwork soldiers were still in business, and they were still assholes. But happily, they can't see invisibility, and Thoth went incognito right as the injuries were starting to pile up. So the metal men went after Pratena, who bitch-slapped them through the walls of the train car with her busy fists. It's amazing what you can do with a well-placed bull rush when you're perched on top of a tank mounted on a speeding locomotive. That done, the party made haste to stop the gnomes inside the tank before they got it fully operational with its two thousand hit points and prodigious damage reduction. Pratena wrenched off the hatch, Barrel dropped a bundle of fuse bombs inside, and Thoth used Fire Breath directly into the cockpit... where they were trying to reload the explosive shell of the main cannon.\n\nThere's nothing that stains clothes quite like a superheated meat-geyser. On the plus side, the tank got a really nifty paint job. On the minus side, Thoth picked exactly the wrong moment to inhale.\n\nThe party then successfully stopped the train and met up with the orc horde, who had thoroughly pacified the remaining soldiers. There was now a rather frantic debate on what exactly constituted as the \"engine\" and what was the \"cars\", because *seriously I want that fucking tank*. So did the orcs, who were champing at the bit to turn it into their own personal seige [waAAAGHon](http://redd.it/2o32j0), despite the fact that they had absolutely no knowledge of engineering or mechanics. It's big and it's armored and it can move, let's stick a bunch of skulls on it and crash it into some gits! Eventually a compromise was reached, where the party would take the tank for three days to \"clean it out\" (read: decommission the weapons and reverse engineer everything). The orcs agreed, because even they took issue with entering a cockpit filled with two solid feet of liquefied nazignome and metal shrapnel.\n\nThe party hauled the train engine and the tank off into the sunset, but returned after four days, prompting a lengthy argument about whether three was bigger or smaller than four (they decided it was smaller, because three extended fingers was closer to being a fist). That done, everyone involved congratulated themselves on the spectacular success of the mission and threw a huge party, complete with a festive piñata that for some reason screamed obscenities in high-pitched german. This festive mood was spoiled when an invisible creature wrenched the bulkiest part of the engine out of the train and dropped it directly onto Barrel's head. Did I not mention that Barrel was being stalked by an invisible creature with a vendetta? Because he was.\n\nAll eyes traveled up to the attacker, barely visible by the old arrow that had permanently lodged in its chest, floating about forty feet above the ground. Once everyone had seen it, it started to speed off over the landscape, making good time. Unfortunately, the attacker had made three major mistakes:\n\n* 1: He had stuck around to gloat and let everyone fix their eyes on the only bit of him that was visible.\n* 2: He had neglected to account for the fact that Thoth knew the haste spell and always had it prepared.\n* 3: He had just fucked with both Rose's friends, and Rose's new toy.\n\n&gt; Rose: I TAKE ALL OF THE OFFENSE.\n\nThere was a high-speed chase across the landscape, the party just barely keeping their quarry in sight by way of precisely-aimed smoke bombs and area-of-effect attacks that tripped up everyone in them. Then their opponent remembered that flight could go in THREE directions, and started to rapidly ascend- this would not do at all. Pratena hurled Barrel, with his kukris outstretched...\n\nHe fell short.\n\nRose heaved up a boulder, and Thoth force-punched it directly at Barrel's feet.\n\nHe sprang off of it and used the extra height to sink both of his daggers into the invisible creature's exposed back.\n\nBarrel clung for dear life as the creature writhed, belting him across the face with a nasty punch that nearly forced him off.\n\nBarrel maintained his grip, swung around, and drove his kukri into what was probably the creature's eyes.\n\nThey both started to plummet. Barrel maneuvered the falling opponent so that he was surfing the injured creature down to the ground.\n\nRose ran ahead and set her spear upright, directly in the path of the plummeting creature.\n\nBarrel struck a three-point landing as his long-time nemesis was impaled chest-first onto Rose's flaming spear.\n\nThe party made a proud march back to their, erm, party, proudly waving their freshly-caught kill. Except, as it turned out, it wasn't a kill- despite everything, the invisible creature was still alive, but quickly dying! This started a heated argument, where everyone was trying to figure out what they wanted more- to kill their hated rival or to sell his horribly broken and dying body to a gaggle of friendly mad scientists. The decision was made significantly easier when they discovered that the invisible creature's blood was a potent ingredient for invisibility potions.\n\n&gt; DM: Remind me, what was your alignment, again?\n\nWith two loose threads neatly tied off (and [YET](http://redd.it/2yhmob) [ANOTHER](http://redd.it/2vbty4) small government completely decapitated), the party dusted their hands and headed back to base.\n\n...\n\nWhat do you mean there’s more? Isn’t this story long enough already?\n\nWell, here a little tidbit before this twist springs on you- long ago, the party had been recruited into their current position as mercenaries by one scary-ass cyclops dude who wielded a ballista and a minivan-on-a-stick as his go-to weapons. Said cyclops dude was currently on scouting duty, as some hubub in the east (around where the base used to be before its big relocation) had been giving rise to a lot of hostile summoned monsters.\n\nWell, said badass cyclops guy was then seen frantically trying to crawl back into the base, trailing a large streak of blood, the ragged stumps that used his legs, oh and A GODDAMN T-REX ROLL FOR INITIATIVE!\n\nThe entire party chipped in on the brief, but intense, battle. Pratena got bitten and grabbed in the thing’s mouth, but it offered an excellent vantage point to punch the overgrown lizard directly in the eye. Defeated, the T-rex seemed to dissolve into mist, leaving pretty much everyone confused. And then Pratena found the box with the note addressed to her.\n\n&gt; SUP PRATENA? -Love, [Sleazeball](http://redd.it/2rxzcc).\n\n[NEXT TIME ON “100 ways to tell your enemy to jam a pineapple into their rectum”, OLD FRIENDS AND WHY DON'T WE JUST NUKE THEM?](http://redd.it/36n9dy)",

        "text": "The next installment of your favourite (I hope) insane assassination duo Rattleshirt and the Harlequin.\n\nPrevious posts:\n\nPart 1. According to the story arc this one is the latest occuring event. [**The Harlequin and the Bear Man**](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/30xcuj/the_harlequin_and_the_bear_man/)\n\nPart 2: The earliest occurring event in the story: [**Rattleshirt**](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/31lyq5/the_harlequin_part_2_rattleshirt/)\n\nPart 3: Lord Mordai.\n\n\nThe Harlequin heaved the body into the trash pile, hastily covering it in garbage to make sure it wouldn't be seen. Rattleshirt stood back, gnawing on what looked like a finger. The Harlequin dusted himself off, put the papers he took of the body into his pocket, and began walking to the city gates. Rattleshirt joined him. \n\n\"Next time I would like a warning when you decide to stab someone in the throat\" The Harlequin said after an uncomfortably long silence.\n\n\"We all want things we may never get, clown.\" Rattleshirt replied, taking another bite of the finger.\n\nThe Harlequin sighed and continued walking. Rattleshirt chewed for a few seconds and spat the finger's bones into his hand and shoved them into his pocket. After almost an hour of walking, The Harlequin and Rattleshirt had made it back to the Legion's encampment. Almost immediately after entering the camp they were approached by a guard bearing the symbol of Lord Mordai 'Master of Diplomatic Relationships.'\n\n\"Excuse me sirs. Master Mordai has requested your presence at his tent.\" The guard said, saluting. \nRattleshirt froze. Then slowly turned his head to the guard. He walked up to the guard to the point that their faces were almost touching. The guard was still saluting and trying to not look scared to have a bone covered, madman inches from his face.\n\nRattleshirt broke the silence after a few seconds \"If you so much as dare come within arm's reach again you'll find that your throat will gain a great urge to leave your body. Do you understand?\"\n\nThe guard's face turned white \"....Y-Yes Sir.\" He sputtered before briskly walking away.\n\n\"Worthless child had better learn to never waste my time with his presence again.\" Rattleshirt said, turning towards Mordai's tent. The Harlequin remained silent. The two approached Mordai's tent and the guards outside parted to let them through. The Harlequin looked around the tent of Lord Mordai. It was filled with paper scrolls, books, and ink wells. In the center of the tent was a large desk, far cleaner than the rest of the tent, it was organised. Behind the desk sat a tall creature with two large horns sprouting from the side of his temples, twisting up above the back of his head. \n\nMordai looked up. \"Ah gentlemen, glad you could make it. How was the get together with our good Captain of the guard?\"\n\nRattleshirt spoke up \"He won't be a problem anymore\"\n\n\"Excellent\" Mordai replied. \"Now we should be able to gain a foothold in this city as the late Captain's replacement is much more.....Practical. He realizes that if there's and army sitting outside your gates it's best to do what ever the army says.\"\n \n\"Also, I found these in his pocket. some kind of order paper.\" The Harlequin said, handing a sealed envelope to Mordai.\n\n\"Ah thank you, I'll have a look over these now. You are dismissed\" Mordai said, immediately opening the envelope and reading the enclosed letter.\n\nThe Harlequin began walking out, but stopped when he saw Rattleshirt wasn't moving.\n\n\"Coming, bone man?\"\n\n\"I'll catch up with you later. Mordai and I have something we need to discuss\" Rattleshirt replied.\n\nThe Harlequin shrugged and left the tent. A few silent moments passed in the tent, Mordai's quill scratching away on a piece of paper. Eventually Rattleshirt spoke up.\n\n\"Why'd you let him leave?\"\n\n\"Let who leave, Rattleshirt?\" Mordai replied looking up from his desk.\n\n\"The clown. You told me he'd be helping me on a single task then I could eat him.\"\n\n\"Ah the clown.\" Mordai said returning to his work. \"Sorry but the plan's changed, he's much more useful to me alive. You'll just have to find some random person to eat like you usually do.\"\n\nA smile began to dance across Rattleshirt's lips \"Is that your final decision?\"\n\n\"Is that your final decision what?\" Mordai said, raising an eyebrow.\n\n\"Is that your final decision, sir.\" Rattleshirt replied.\n\n\"Yes it is. You are dismissed. I will send for you next time I need you. Also you'd better not kill the messenger again. Believe it or not they aren't cheap\"\n\nA wicked grin spread across Rattleshirt's face \"Of course, sir.\" Rattleshirt said before leaving Mordai and returning to his own tent.\n After night had fallen Rattleshirt stalked across the camp grounds, being careful to avoid and patrolling guards and large patches of light. Rattleshirt moved swiftly and silently back to Mordai's tent. He carefully cut a hole in the tent on the opposite side to the entrance and slipped through. Instantly seeing Mordai asleep in his bed Rattleshirt quietly approached his unconscious body. Rattleshirt's grin gleamed in the darkness as he pulled a small vial from his robes and poured it down Mordai's throat. \n\"Mordai's an old man after all and he could die at any point. At least he's dying quietly in his sleep.\" Rattleshirt mused to himself as Mordai's body began to spasm and froth started pouring from his mouth. Rattleshirt left as quickly and quietly as he'd come. That clown would die by his hand, but he knew he was difficult to pin down. Rattleshirt would need help. \n\nHe thought it was high time he made some powerful friends. So he began his work. \n\n",

        "text": "Hello, friends. Tonight I come to give you my first recount of my small circle of friends recent D&amp;D Shenanigans. I'm not often one to share, but this...Is definitely worth it. First, some background.\n\nOur level 3 party is helping with protecting a small, militant village on the edge of a wild, uninhabited area of the world known as the Wildlands, which is cut off from \"Civilization\" by a queer ravine of undetermined depth. Access is highly limited, which is a godsend for all involved, as it greatly limits the nasties that cross over. Said village was attacked by a surprise attack of a gigantic mass of kobolds, lead by gnolls -- However, from the wrong side of the chasm. Our party set out to find them.\n\nThe party? Yours truly, the barbarian. A war cleric, a dual wielding ranger, a bow ranger, a druid, and a noodle-armed wizard with the odd habit of being able to outroll me in strength checks (to my utter disgust).\n\nOur druid knows the area. The rest of us are essentially travelers that have volunteered to help. After some headaches, the druid tracks down the forward camp. Lo, and behold -- Newly constructed bridges. They are finely made; Not typical gnoll handiwork. He informs us of the deed.\n\nThe plan is made: We commandeer all the oil we can, grab as many able bodies as the (newly weakened) village can spare, and we go out to stop the breeding kobolds and scatter the gnolls to give the town time to recuperate, minus our druid, who disappeared because \"Druids do weird shit sometimes\" (Meh, his player couldnt make it that day. Sall good)\n\nSetting the scene: 25 able bodied fighters (B-listers for certain) armed with swords and hand-crossbows. A loaded, open wagon filled with barrels of oil, with torches on the outer frame. The party's surly misfits moving ahead. We spot the camp; Horribly constructed wooden huts, with a larger hut near the center. We contemplate hailing the entire area in flaming bolts as a precaution, but it's shot down. \n\n*\"We have no idea if the gnolls have prisoners. Let's not be murderers today.\"*\n\nThe wagon continues trundling forward and we move ahead. The barking begins. We have gnoll wolfriders, 3 or 4 of them coming across the open plain between us and the camp. Our rangers open fire, with one being absolutely deadly with her bows....The other, less so. The wolfriders are quickly whittled down in the crossfire and if any survive, it's often just the wolf retreating. We escape without much harm, despite the gnolls trying to fire-and-retreat.\n\nThe weakened survivors return. More gnolls see their battered state and scatter, kicking open the doors to the smaller huts. Oh, there were prisoners inside, alright. But not ones we were hoping to save. Out come *dozens of kobolds* whipped into attacking us. Thankfully, despite being only moderately trained, having brought along 25 semi-archers with us saved us more grief than I can imagine. The party's only level 3 at this point, after all i must remind. The kobolds reach me, the barbarian and I quickly set in to mowing them down before the little shits manage to surround our squishier people. After having a horrible first few sessions earlier in the campaign, I say that this is my therapy session for letting kobolds continually bring me down to 1 hp and leaving me clinging to life. They're being dropped like flies, and it felt **so good.**\n\nThey're gone, and gnolls have begun massing. We take the fight to them. Partway through the fight, our cart is attacked and set ablaze by the surviving wolf rider with flaming logs he's picked up from the large bonfire going in the center of camp. Alot of the oil sets ablaze, but we carry on. The bridges won't take, and it's obvious our caution has let our initial plan turn what should have been a \"Dash and burn\" into an all out slog into a meatgrinder. Things look a little harrowing for us, truthfully.\n\nThen the fun part starts. Across the Wildlands Ravine, we see him: A gnoll Overlord. Just sittin' there. Staring at us with a shit-eating grin with a handful of pack lord bodyguards. Covered in gaudy, cheap jewelry and human remains war trophies. Our eagle-eyed wizard sees all. We can't get to him, and he's seemingly content letting his lessers do the job. At this point I was glad to see him delegating.\n\nSlowly, surely, the gnolls attacking us are pushed back, or distracted as now, finally, the bridges are beginning to catch fire. One is gone, two is gone. The guards with the oil cart kick the burning barrels at the gnolls and set more than a few ablaze to give themselves space and save the single unopened barrel from catching. \n\n A new threat emerges to the sound of the Overlord's immense pleasure. We finally near the center of the camp and a giant, red mass bursts from the larger building and bullrushes the cart. It's a fucking Red Slaad.\n\nEdit: Right. Record scratch, folks. A red Slaad. Just being knocked around by Gnolls. Weird, right? I forgot to mention. Before we've tracked down the gnolls, we've come across another party-relevant baddie by the name of Metzger. Nice guy. Slaver extraordinaire. Incredibly flamboyant bastard with the penchant to enslave and sell every other creature he sees to the other half of every other creature he sees. Two points to the genius who puts together where a band of marauding Gnolls got such a beastie?\n\n Our wizard gets an incredible roll and tells us literally everything about it in the span of 5 seconds. And then a moment of horrible realization sets in for him. He knows that the Slaad has a control gem. The Slaad's head looks like it's been busted open in the past and healed over somewhat. That overlord has some fine, if not tasteful jewelry. Including an impressive necklace....A plan is quickly put into place with our druid, and our archer ranger.\n\nI and the Cleric rush the slaad in an attempt to slow it down. We whack away at it -- It ignores us entirely. It sets in to the front ranks of the people guarding the saved cart and tears them apart with each claw and bite it can get off. The plan is set into action, and holy shit you guys it was beautiful.\n\nOur wizard calls on his familiar to go and pester the Overlord (read: Give the wizard Aid). This dinky little raven. It does so, and flies off, in an attempt to bite a retaliation swing. The DM fudged game mechanics a bit to make this work, but in a Rule of Cool fashion, it worked off gloriously. After the raven distracted the Overlord, operation \"Lolwut\" commenced. The wizard, and druid act in concert. The wizard blasts off a scorching ray, hoping to sear the necklace's chains and get it off the otherwise untouchable Overlord's neck. **He gets it!** The druid, now in falcon form, divebombs and gets it before it even hits the ground! The overlord has no reaction to him leaving his threatened space!\n\nBUT WAIT! Those of you who read this far may ask: What about the bodyguards!? Yeahhh. The bodyguards still had their reactions. The one that could reach him snaps out with his weapon and hits the little 1-hp-as-a-falcon druid and pops him out of birdform before he can take off. But it's still his turn, the druids. He has a flash of movement left. He has another wildshape! The guy who can reach him used his reaction!\n\nI like to imagine the druid ran off 15 feet, turned around, made a jerking motion with his spare hand, and laughed just before becoming a falcon again and beginning to fly off across the ravine. All of us are raving. So much could have gone wrong! BIG GODDAMN HEROES moment for certain.\n\nWe ask if we did the right thing. The DM laughs and says that YES, goddamn it. We got the control gem for the Slaad. The Slaad immediately stops attacking people, and drops our dwarven Cleric it had grappled a moment before.\n\nThe rest of us are confused until the wizard tells us the planned worked, and we hear yet again that goddamned Overlord. The laughter was cut short. He's now genocidally furious. He's shrieking things I can't begin to fathom and suddenly starts bursting towards the bridge, knocking over his lesser packmates in his rage. More than a few tumble into the ravine in shock.\n\nGnolls are packed onto both remaining bridges, stunned for a moment to see their leader charge into battle so suddenly. I suppose they didnt see our lucky moment of Dickery. The first of the remaining two bridges has two small, controlled fires burning on it, and it's beginning to groan from stress and strain. \n\nI have a thought, and Dash to the side of the bridge available to me, hoping to cut the Gnoll's advances short, if just for a few more moments. The druid commands his new pet red Slaad to the bridge as backup. I get there long before it does. the Overlord is hulk-charging his way onto the weakened bridge, shoving his own men out of his way. It's never stopped howling and spitting in a frenzy. It's managed to dash 3/4 of the way across the bridge and will very shortly make horrible work of me. **Now's my time to shine.**\n\nI attack the weakened, charred ropes of the bridge with my Greataxe. The already unstable bridge completely gives way. The Overlord and his pack scramble to hold onto anything, but every last one of them botch any attempt at a dex save to grab on to a more strong section of the bridge, and they all plummet to the bottom of the for-all-i-know endless ravine.\n\nI just became the cause of death for 10 Gnolls and their overlord in a single swing of my axe. I am laughing the most horrible, shittiest laughter, both in character and out as I see what's actually occured here. The gnolls that werent on the bridges BOLT as soon as they see their leader take a dive, and completely abandon the fight, and their main camp on the opposite side of the ravine.\n\nEveryone cheers wildly. It's *incredible!* And made even more so when we learned we weren't even meant to fight the Overlord at all. Not yet. He was originally felt to be driven off and come back for revenge. He was going to be the boss for the party around 4 or 5 levels later when he came back for revenge. But how would he not attack us after we steal his greatest, most expensive slave from him? Thank every deity out there he couldn't. I was at half health and on my final Rage. I would've been cut to ribbons.\n\nSo much could have gone horribly wrong. But we pulled off our Big Damn Heroes moments and I have never been more convinced that sometimes, RNGesus really is looking out for us. Thanks for reading. \n\n",

        "text": "[Link to Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/31i4p0/pathfinder_gallopavo_shipping_company_part_1/)\n\nPart 2 is actually the first session we played together, and for me, it was my first session of Pathfinder/DnD ever. It picks up where Part 1 left off.\n\n**The Story**  \nSuddenly, the door opens and in walks a gnome, and even by gnome standards, he is small. He introduces himself as Felxium Corwor McGiddle. He thanks us for accepting the company's job offer and asks them to follow him further in to the building for a training session.  \nAs we travel through the building, it is noted that the building rather quiet and quite empty. At the end of the hall, we enter into conference room without a table with some chairs on one side and a single occupied chair on the opposite side. The occupant of this seat is an elderly gentleman gently dosing in his seat. At Felxium's instruction, we take a seat and he rouses the old man and the old man begins the training seminar. He cast some illusion on the wall that basically functions as a projector (it was probably Prestidigitation).  \nThe seminar is... well, a training seminar, talking about how the company does this and that, and how lucky you are to be working there, yadda yadda yadda, blah blah blah, no one cares. Out of character, I jokingly mention rolling Fort saves to not fall asleep. I forget if the DM actually told me to do it or if I did just because, but I roll and fail some arbitrary DC. Baldric sleeps through the entire seminar.  \nAnywho, after the seminar is over, Felxium again asks us to follow him into another room. In this room is a desk and a single filing cabinet. Felxium walks over to the filing cabinet and begins opening it... and the drawer just keeps coming... Like half-way across the room and there is still more left. It was a Filing Cabinet of Bureaucratic Efficiency. Felxium strolls along this drawer until he finds what he is looking for... Our contracts.  \nThese contracts are huge. Five inches thick, about 500 pages in length, heavy, and extremely thorough. They detailed everything that could possibly go wrong, including many different ways that we could possibly die, exactly what we are required to do in order for us to get paid, and about 400 pages worth of legal bullshit. After giving these to us, Felxium then gives us Pens of Bureaucratic Efficiency that signs out names for us...  \nAfter all the legal bullshit was out of the way, we then head to the loading docks to meet our driver and get on our way. This is where we meet Theno the Angry Halfling. Theno and Felxium say goodbye, we say goodbye, and we head off from Claybrook to our first stop on the way to Westport, Copperton.\n\nIt takes a few days, but we finally crest a hill and there is Copperton. As we are walking to Copperton, we pass by some \"drunks\", one of which bumps into Zadok and then bumps into me, stealing some coins from my pocket. Being diplomatic, Baldric stops the \"drunks\" and calls them out on stealing some gold off of me. They of course pretend to not know what we're talking about and claiming that they didn't steal anything. We tried threatening them and when that didn't work we decided to kill them.  \nThese guys weren't actually drunk. They were bandits/thieves. The combat was a relatively simple, uneventful low-level encounter... With one exception. First round of combat, Ricard cuts one of the bandits completely in half with a max damage crit. After that, it was really easy to clean up the other two guys.  \nAfter the skirmish, we put one half on each side of the road along with a sign warning bandits that this will be them or whatever.\n\nWe get into Copperton, deliver our packages and go to the local tavern to spend the night. Before heading off to bed, everyone has some drinks, including Emily. Which is when Lucius finally gets his revenge... He spikes her drink with a potion of polypurpose panacea with the hallucination effect.\n\nThe next morning, we leave Copperton. By midday, we reach a forest, but about an hour into the forest, we come across some trees blocking the path. Due to their size, we have to go back and take an alternate route. This upsets Theno greatly.  \nSo the alternate route goes through a less-traveled section of the same forest. And we soon find out why it's less-traveled.  \nAs we traveling through the forest, we feel an odd presence, like something is following us, watching us. Not long after, we hear a voice telling us to get out. We ignore it, even taunt it a little. We go on a little longer when we hear the voice again, this time louder and angrier.  \nRounding a bend in the road, we find the path blocked by large, overgrown plants. Roll initiative, bitches. Suddenly, we are attacked by invisible feys, atomies to be specific. The atomies, thanks to their size, team up, mostly 2v1 with everyone except Baldric and Lucius. The fight is pretty difficult. We're outnumbered and we aren't rolling very well.  \nEventually, we start to turn the fight around and the bastards suddenly disappear. It is about this time that we start getting shot at from somewhere in the forest. The atomies then begin reappearing and attacking us again. As we are still winning the fight, but getting lower and lower in health, around us, the plants begin to grow in size and grow thorns. Yay, entangle... \n\nThis is where shit gets really difficult...\n\nAll but one person in the party beats the Reflex save. The majority of the party is suddenly significantly slowed, taking damage per turn, all on top of being attacked by feys and some unseen enemy. Any guesses as to the identity of this enemy?  \nIt takes a few rounds, but we finally finish off the rest of the fey and begin hunting for our unseen foe. After a while of slowly getting out of the entangled area and Baldric nearly getting killed by this unseen archer, Lucius finally gets mad enough and throws a bomb at a random tree... And the tree screams in pain... Figured it out yet?  \nIT WAS A FUCKING DRYAD! Oh, my God! It tooks us nearly an hour to find this dryad who was hiding as a fuucking tree. A tree, as it turns out, I had been talking about casting Light on... We almost got TPK'ed by a tree!  \nAfter finding the Dryad, we begin trying to kill it, but, apparently, tree-shaped Dryad's have really good AC. In fact, the only one who was able to hurt it in any significant way was Lucius and his touch attack bombs.  \nWe finally get it low enough, but it runs away by Tree Striding...  \n\nWhatever... We get on our way and get out of that godforsaken forest. We make it to the next town along our route and that is where the first session ends.\n\n**TLDR: Nearly TPK'ed by a tree!**",

        "text": "A friend of mine started a small Dungeon World campaign the other night with a group of people who have never RPed before. He hadn't prepared a setting, so we were to make up characters on the spot and he figured he'd wing it for our first session.\n\nI made a grumpy, very old farmer and part-time thief named Leslie. His hands are shaky and his farm is pretty pathetic. All he really has going for him is a hoard of goods which he has accumulated after decades of compulsive stealing. He is emotionally sustained by the resentful yet paternalistic affection he has for our group's bard (who received his first instrument from Leslie as hush-money for staying quiet about the farmer's thieving hobby) ....and the mysterious love he has for his goat.\n\nThe GM decides to start the game immediately after this goat is stolen. The goat was ostensibly stolen by a wizard. My poor old thief is hysterical and witnesses (the other players) are asking him what is so important about this goat.\n\nSince I have no idea why Leslie's goat was stolen by a wizard, I glance at the GM. He doesn't have something specific in mind either. He thinks for a second and mumbles something about a Goat of Holding, then takes it back.\n\nToo late, seed planted.\n\nAs it turns out, this wizard just ran off with Leslie's life savings. The rather simple farmer had been using this goat to store his hoard for years. It never occurred to him to question the magic behind this storage system... If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\n\nWe embark on a ridiculous quest to track down Leslie's goat. After many interrogations, an impromptu noseflute performance, an owlbear, and a high-speed donkey chase, we eventually find ourselves facing off against a group of doomsday cultists. For whatever reason, they want to accelerate the end of the world. Poor Leslie is forced to watch as his pet goat levitates above the cultists' alter and rips open into a massive inter-dimensional rift. \n\nBy the end of two short sessions, our heroes -- a bard, a druid, and an old thief (now lugging a drugged and bound wizard) -- find themselves in another dimension all because a damn goat went missing that morning.

Specializes in heavy weapons and autofire.\n\nRee'tak, the Twi'lek noble (supporty face). Enlisted the help of the other players to help kill her own overprotective father.\n\n*THE STORY*\n\nOur party went to Mon Calamari for a mission and ended up going fishing. They wanted to keep some of the smaller fish that they caught, so they bought a fish tank and installed it in the middle of an interior bulkhead on the ship, so that it could be viewed from the front and back.\n\nNow, this fish tank had no mechanical benefit, other than providing line of sight through a small section of wall. The fish themselves were practically inconsequential, or so I thought. But my players would get a kick out of feeding the fish, despite me never describing them or the tank beyond just \"fish\" and \"fish tank.\" \n\nHaneta fed the fish often, and one day, he fed them three separate times. Jason takes a small plushie that he bought on Mon Calamari and stuffs it into his grenade launcher, then points it at Haneta yelling, \"Stop feeding the fish so much, or they're going to get fat!\" \n\nJason's player says that he's going to shoot the plushie at aneta, so I make them roll initiative. Haneta beats him, and runs into a side room, drawing his pistol. Jason gives chase and fires the plushie at Haneta. Using a grenade launcher. He misses, and the plushie bounces against a wall behind Haneta. Haneta picks up the plushie and throws it back at Jason, failing to hit as well. Jason picks up the plushie again and throws it back, missing Haneta again. He says, \"If you don't give up, I've got five more real grenades!\" \n\nAt this point, Haneta tries to shoot Jason's grenade launcher. He misses, and Jason drops the grenade launcher, pulls out his heavy repeating blaster, and fires at Haneta using a feat that allowed him to make a normal attack rather than an autofire attack (which would have damaged Haneta, even on a miss). Haneta dodges out of the way, then switches to stun and makes an attack against Jason himself. \n\nHaneta scores a critical hit, which tickled Jason and made him angry. But he failed the opposed initiative check to make Jason flat-footed against his next attack. Now, with shots being fired, the other party members start rushing from the cockpit down to the cargo hold. Jason fires at Haneta, dealing over half of his HP in damage. Haneta starts screaming, \"I set to nonlethal!\" over and over again. He runs past Jason, out of the room. \n\nRee'tak manages to catch a glimpse of this through the fishtank, so when she moves forward, she draws her pistol and says, \"Ok, everyone calm down or I'll shoot both of you!\" Jason drops his gun and runs up and punches Haneta, taking away almost all of his HP. Haneta retreats away from Ree'tak, running around Jason to give himself cover from the interloper, and again fails to hit Jason with a stun shot. \n\nRee'tak decides to close the room's doors to prevent either of them from getting out, then goes to watch the fight through the fish tank. At this point, Jason's player just says \"F*** it\" and pulls out his repeating blaster pistol, intent on dealing enough damage even with a miss to knock Haneta unconscious. He rolls a natural 20. Haneta had been using his force points before that, so he only had one left to avoid dying. Jason immediately made a Treat Injury check, and the party continued on to Nar Shaddaa.\n\nTL;DR: So our scoundrel almost died because another player didn't want our pet fish to get fat.",

        "text": "I had found passage aboard the merchant ship “Mayflower”, Captain Trent had agreed that for my services (mostly entertainment and the occasional seafaring duties) that I was granted free passage to Shine as he had cargo destined for the Coastal Jewel. The journey took several weeks and I got to know the others reasonably well, although they were slightly taken aback when I introduced myself as “Captain Vash Weston, the man that will become Pirate King!”; they must have been shocked, they’ve probably heard of me.\n\nWe were almost at our destination, almost home to Shine, when it happened. The Captain, had called his passengers to his quarters for a meal. Captain Trent was making a toast to good travels when it happened; A cannonball came crashing into the captain’s quarters. Some of the glass from the shattered window covered me as I brought my longcoat up to prevent the worst of it and the doors burst open and I recognised some of the crew with swords in hand as crew of the Mayflower, but they were obviously intent on harming the captain.\n\nMutiny. The word shakes me with anger at just the thought, the betrayal, the treason, the realisation shook me to my core; I don’t remember drawing my rapier and dagger but as the first worthless excuse for a sailor waved a cutlass in my general direction he was shocked when my rapier found his stomach, cutting deep. He barely had a chance to cry out in pain before I stepped into him, dagger to heart as I watched his eyes flicker from anger, to fear, to a lifeless acceptance. I looked up, my vision blurry and my fellow diners had culled the rest. Captain Trent had shot one with a flintlock pistol he drew from a bandolier, I met eyes with the captain and looked at me, and the body by my feet. He beckoned me over to him and put away his Pistol.\n\n“I have a precious cargo I am charged to deliver to Captain Roberts in Shine, a week from today, swear to me you will deliver it and I’ll see you onto a rowboat.”\n\nI recognised the name, Captain Roberts, a member of the Council of Thirteen Pirate Captains and Lords. I had met him in passing during my time on the White Hydra and I found him pretty inspiring. “Captain Trent, you have my word from one Captain to another, I will uphold this duty.”\n\nThe rest of the gathered guests seemed to murmur something that resembled agreement, and I figured it would be helpful to have some crew to assist in this task. Captain Trent then took a chest from a secret compartment in his desk and handed it to me. [The chest was ornate, with a draconic design](http://www.themusicboxcompany.com/images/dragons_wizards_knights/Dragons%20Wizards%20and%20Knights/Dragon%20Box%20with%20Celtic%20Design%206408ytc.jpg); I recognised it immediately as one of three lost chests of Draksis, rightfully mine as I was destined to become pirate king, but I could haggle out that detail with Captain Roberts once I had delivered it to him. I secured the chest in my bag and nodded to Trent before following him onto the deck.\n\nAs we ran onto the deck a familiar smell assaulted us, burnt gunpowder and blood, a harsh metallic scent and all around us was death and treachery. Not all of Captain Trent’s crew were disloyal, and a fierce battle raged around us, another ship had broadsided us and was coming in to board us. The ship was in view and for a moment I faltered, It was the Dreadnaught, the Vendrikar Pirate Scourge Blackdog’s ship. Blackdog was a behemoth of an Orc, known throughout the Dreamsea as an extremely pragmatic pirate devoid of anything resembling a moral compass, and his ship, the Galleon known as the Dreadnaught was far larger than our trading vessel, outgunned us to a degree that isn’t even comical and has a crew at least two hundred strong, we didn’t even have half a full complement of our original fifty thanks to the mutiny. Captain Trent moved through the melee with a pistol in both hands and shouted at us to get in the rowboat, we obliged him and wished him luck as he dropped us into the sea below… it wasn’t the most graceful of exits but it was quick. I grabbed the oars, being unsure of the sea-worthiness of the rest of my crew and began rowing.\n\nWe had covered a reasonable distance when we noticed them, two rowboats giving chase to us, a stern looking Bosun (I’m guessing but he looked like a Bosun to me) on one, being rowed by two pirates, and another rowing two pirates on the other. A few of us mustered up some spells to throw at them, the Gnome Kurtious plinked away with magic, I asked the Half-Orc Aggorak to take over rowing and I managed to channel a Thunderwave through my violin in their general direction when they were close, though none were thrown overboard. The ranger Luna managed to land a few shots with her longbow and for some reason the gnome summoned a flying jellyfish onto the second boat, that caused enough confusion for it to drop out of the chase. The Bosun got close enough to start to swing a club at the back of our ship and I was almost shot with a crossbow bolt from one of the rowing pirates. Thal’galan’s rapier managed to strike true enough, eventually, and the Bosun went overboard, the rowing pirates were injured and demoralised enough to give up the chase and we continued rowing, knowing Shine wasn’t too far away.\n\nI was confident in my ability to navigate this particular sea, it was close to home after all. The weather got a little choppy and I took over rowing again. The storm gathered for what seemed like hours of rowing in the wet and the wind. The sea threw us about the rowboat and threatened to capsize us more than once. I remember one wave I was sure would be the end of us approaching, and I remember shouting a warning. The next thing I remember is the sun beating down on me and the sand on my face, I got up, brushing myself off with a combination of Prestidigitation and good old fashioned shaking, as I went around the beach with a head count, kicking the others awake. I couldn’t see the boat but I still had half an oar, and everyone was present. They seemed a little upset at the fact we had sunk the rowboat but I reminded everyone I had safely captained us to shore, and I knew where we were… it was an isolated little cove, but I had washed up here before. Apparently they did not find the fact I’d washed up here before as reassuring as I thought they would but I guess you can’t please everyone. We took a short rest, gathered our senses and checked the general debris and flotsam about this abandoned cove. I told them I knew of a smuggler’s den we could pass through that lead to this beach and would be able to get us to Shine in a day or two. They discussed it and decided to trust me, as they still needed to get to Shine. The smuggler’s cove was pretty close by, but it wasn’t exactly how I remember it.  \n  \n[Part 1 - Prelude](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/311ywh/dd_5e_the_singing_pirate_prelude/)  \n[Part 3 - The Smuggler's Cove](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/32fwan/dd_5e_the_singing_pirate_the_smugglers_cove/)",

The Salamander was using his Wall of Fire (can use 3 times / day) and controlling the battle field pretty well.\n\nTo stop the Salamander using more magic, the cleric thought that using a silence spell would be a good idea. It would neutralize his spell casting abilities or make him move out of the fire blaze room he was  in. It's a reasonable idea but then came the Wombo combo!!\n\nSo the whole room the Salamander was in was under the effect of silence. The next time it was the cleric's turn, he announced, all triumph and confident, he was doing the spell Sound Lance (I started laughing inside but said nothing) and was saying it was a very good spell and would do 10d8 of damage. With great anticipation he used the spell and I gave a very good detailed description of what was happening and when the spell hit the silenced area and dissipated, everyone looked at me with their jaw dropped....and then a burst of laughter echoed through the room. \n\nThe next 10min everything stopped while people where trying to stop laughing ",

He was raised in an alienage and all of his friends and family in there where killed by bandits, leading to an intense hatred of them.  \n--Hafthulln Bjornsson, the Nordic Paladin who worships the god of law, Tyr, and tries to be a straight shooter, despite having to deal with Carric's antics. His entire tribe was destroyed by Frost Giants and he can't help but go into some kind of blood rage when he sees them.  \n--Limpbizkit Bindtwarden, the Gnome Bard whose name no-one truly knows and so he changes it almost every time the DM mispronounces yet.  \n--Aaitoire Surefist, the Elf who was raised in the Dwarven Continent as a monk from a young age. He tries to be a good person but is constantly interrupted by Carric.  \n--Vistra Fireforge, the Dwarfish Cleric who is adventuring with the party as a means of protection while collecting the tithe for her god.  \n\nThis part will be a direct continuation to the previous one in that it occured in the same session and directly after the events that where written about there.\n\nAs the fog dispersed and the party took a moment to collect themselves, they decided to start looting. The Necromancer was the first thing they looted, finding a large red ruby and some coinage.\n\nThe party have delt with some Necromancers before and also found a red ruby on them, which upon an arcana check they had determined that it was some kind of powerful dark magic infused artifact. Last time they decided to get it disenchanted and destroyed properly at the wizard's college and that was also the plan this time.\n\nLimpbizkit then used his Locate Object spell to attempt to locate an emerald as he was looking for something big and expensive to offer up to his god. The spell led him to a room containing a treasure hoard of sorts as well as a large emerald that glinted as he held it. This instantly tipped him off to some kind of magical enchantment on the emerald so he called over Carric to come and check it out.\n\nCarric had no idea what was going on with the emerald, however Gotrek the Druid asked if he could have both of the gems to examine them. As Gotrek held one gem in each hand, Carric noticed that the arm holding the ruby was shaking, so he smacked the ruby out of his hand, smashing it on the floor.\n\nGotrek then refused to speak.\n\nCarric was a bit freaked out and so cast Detect Thoughts and asked Gotrek what he had seen. Gotrek told the party that both of the gems where extremely powerful magical artifacts. The emerald is what is refferred to by most as the \"World Seed\" or \"The Daughter of Gaia\" and all that is known about it is that it is the key to a perfect world. The ruby on the other hand is one of the 7 Rubies of Kelemvor and if all are collected together at once then they can be used to summon and control Death himself.\n\nCarric, realising that he was completely over his head, took the World Seed up to the surface and prayed to Gaia to ask what the hell was goiong on. He suddenly had two visions, one of a utopian world that definitely wasn't theirs and one of their world but filled with darkness and destruction. Carric told the party about these and then they decided to return back to town to talk to a priest of Gaia to see what they should do with the World Seed.",

        "text": "My new favorite psionic power is Skills As One, a 1st level power that allows you to share the highest skill rank between people in your hivemind-thing. That is, if you use this power and target 6 people with it and say the skill 'Swim', if one of the members had 6 ranks in it the rest would be considered to have 6 ranks in it until the spell ends.  \n  \nIt isn't formally written into that spell, but in some of the other similar spells you could do this to STEAL the power from another creature. If you cast the spell 'Senses as One' on a creature with blindsense, you can actually gain that AND MAKE THEM LOSE IT for the rest of the spell. For funs, my DM said I could do the same with Skills as One.  \n  \nTurns out, there is a lot of stupid stuff you can do with that. My current list:  \n  \nTake away the Escape Artist skill from someone stuck in a grapple. Doesn't matter how slippery a rogue is if they suddenly lose every rank in escape artist.  \n  \nTake away Knowledge (religion) from a cultist. We believe they worship an elder god, possibly Hastur, but the knowledge DC is so high we cna't actually know that in game. Interestingly, that means that if you take away a cultists Knowledge(religion), THEY can't remember either. There is no better way to incapacitate a divine spellcaster than removing the very name and existence of their god from their mind.  \n  \nTake away racial Acrobatic ranks from some normally graceful creatures. Turns out, Redcaps think it is EXTREMELY rude to take away a faeries natural grace in the middle of a fight, and the one I discovered this with ignored my party and just kept trying to attack me. Thankfully, the Acrobatics bonus it provided me meant that I could just walk away from it, forcing it to provoke attack after attack of opportunity that it normally wouldn't ever take.  \n  \nIt isn't all fun and games. Right now, the entire fey race has declared war on me for ripping their fey abilities out of their bodies and using it as my own, and I'm like 90% sure that Hastur is sending an avatar of himself to the material plane to stop me from giving his cultists existiential crises. But if he ever shows up, I will take away HIS knowledge (religion) and so he forgets who he is!  \n  \n(from what I can gather, adding people the collective is NOT a mind-affecting ability, since mind-affecting means it only works on creatures with an INT of 1 or higher, and you can add creatures to the collective if they have a WIS of 1 or higher. NOT mind-affecting! and any spell you cast on a member of your collective loses the mind-affecting properties!)  \n  \nPsionics get WEIRD sometimes.",

        "text": "First post here.  I'm on mobile, so I apologize in advance for any mistakes.  I'll try and fix what I can in the future.  Anyway...\n\nSo this story happened a while ago.  May 21, so somewhere in the middle of season 4.  I greatly enjoyed the ARAM game mode.  First champ rolls come up, and I get Rammus.  I still had my two rerolls, and I'm debating doing so.  But two things stop me.\n\n1: I know that we'll probably need a tank, as anyone on our team with a tanky champ is likely to reroll for one that fits better into the ARAM playstyle.\n\n2: I really like Rammus.  I don't get to play him a lot, though, as I don't usually get to pick him in a normal game.  Usually I'm support, and when I am jungling, there are some champs that I'm better with.  It would be nice to get to play him again.\n\nI also had just recently purchased the Full Metal Rammus skin, but that most certainly had no impact on my decision.\n\nI can't remember the make-up of the teams, but I was correct in assuming I'd play the role of tank.  They did have a lot of poke-heavy champs, including a Braum and a Nidalee, whereas we had a more teamfight oriented team.\n\nSo I fully immerse myself in my role.  If there was a skillshot coming at one of my teammates, I'd eat that right up.  Grab the Horn and build straight tank to rush at them and initiate.  Peel for anyone low on health and running for the health packs.  Just tank things.\n\nIt's a good fifteen or so minutes into the game, and both of the tier one towers are down.  That's when one of the other players say their first words to me.\n\n\"By the way, Rammus, the other four of us are on Skype, and we're calling you Batman.\"   A couple of the others agree, and I type out, \"well I hope I can live up to the name.\"\n\nBut on the inside, I'm thinking.  I am the tank they need.  I am the powerball that smashes down the wall of injustice.  The taunt that pulls villains away from the innocent and defenseless, and into retribution.  I am Rammus.  I am the tank.  I am Batman.\n\nTLDR: Okay.\n\nWe struggle through a few more teamfights, taking and losing the second tower.  But finally, we manage to push through, and win the game.\n\nI think the best part of the game, though, was at the end game chat.  \"Thanks Batman.\"\n\nThings like that don't happen too often, but when they do, they're amazing.  Even this long after, when I haven't even played for the longest time, I think back and it puts a smile on my face.",

        "text": "(This is a story version of a game of Sentinels of the Multiverse, where players are superheroes fighting against a common foe in an all-or-nothing scenario. Either all the heroes win, or all the heroes lose. The heroes, villains and environment can all do damage to each other. Bolded names are cards in the game)\n\nPete Riske, known to his friends at Freedom Tower as the ever-optimistic **SETBACK** is out enjoying a fine spring day in **Megalopolis**, when he trips over a black cat that had dashed into his path. Stumbling down a steep hill, he accidentally knocks over Harry's Hot Dog stand, sending it rolling the rest of the way down the hill and into an alley.\n\nWhen Pete hears the expletives coming from the alley, he thinks he might have hurt someone and rushes to check. What he finds is **BARON BLADE** and **FRIGHT TRAIN** covered in relish and sauerkraut and extremely angry.\n\nPutting in a call to Freedom Tower to call for backup for his imminent beating, Pete runs from the alley, quickly donning his costume. Well, quickly for him. He trips a few times trying to get into it, but still manages to  run far enough that he bumps into his backup.\n\nRyan Frost, the man whose body requires a special suit in order to function at temperatures above his namesake, **ABSOLUTE ZERO** descends.\n\n\"Seriously, Setback, how hard is it for you to stay out of trouble?\" \n\nFright Train arrives first, more intent on dealing a **Crushing Blow** to Setback than anything else. The fact that the luckless regenerator responds to such force with a simple \"Owie!\" only serves to piss him off.\n\nBaron Blade loads up his launcher with **Regression Darts** firing at Setback. The negative chemical solution inside those darts makes Setback unable to do anything for now. But Setback feels the Force of Karmic Retribution swing in his favor, a burst of healing energy flowing through him. He takes a Risk, knowing that it may bite him later on, but this time he and his ally are blessed with **Surprising Fortune!** \n\nAbsolute Zero feels more power coursing through him and in return, he creates a spike of ice between him and Fright Train, with the intent to **Impale** him. That should slow him down.\n\nTheir fight has attracted the attention of **Police Backup** who even though their weapons are ineffective at best, still ping away at the Baron and Fright Train with their handguns.\n\nSetback can't resist taunting the man-mountain, and finds himself caught in an **Improbable Grapple** and thrown against the tracks for the Monorail.\n\nBaron Blade activates his dreaded **Impulsion Beam** limiting what the heroes can do for the next round.\n\nDespite the pain he's in, things are **Looking Up** for Setback, as he manages to smack the Baron solidly. Setback can already feel the weight of his terrible luck on his shoulders, but still takes a Risk again. This cause him to have a **Plucky Break** and deals another blow to the Baron's body and pride.\n\nAbsolute Zero calls upon the power of **Hoarfire** to burn Baron Blade, and freeze Fright Train. But the effort strains him, and he winds up burning and freezing himself. Still he strengthens the imapling ice on Fright Train. There's no way he's letting him down that easy.\n\nThere's a creaking from above, and the police backup fall back as they release the fight has led to a **Plummeting Monorail!** Absolute Zero, the Baron and Fright Train all take significant damage from the thankfully empty train. Setback manages to skirt around disaster.\n\nFright Train goes **Off The Rails,** hurling the ice spike at Setback and breaking free to bring his fearsome fists against Zero's frozen frame.\n\nBaron Blade decides the time has come for a **Vengeful Assault** and strikes at Absolute Zero again.\n\nSetback is hurting, but thankfully, there's a **Silver Lining!** The same regression serum that Baron Blade had used on him earlier is also the source of his rapid regeneration. It's time to take another Risk, leading to Fright Train feeling the force of **Cause and Effect** Even his armored physique can't do much to protect him from the psychic backlash brought on by Setback's luck. However, Setback feels it as well.\n\nAbsolute Zero triggers his **Null-Point Calibration Unit** and uses the power of Thermodynamics to convert what would be a painful blast of ice into healing power for himself.\n\nThe Monorail from before falls a bit harder on them, dealing damage to Absolute Zero, Baron Blade and Fright Train, and getting them trapped in **Close Quarters Combat!** In this tight space, both sides are limited to doing melee damage to each other.\n\nWith his **Unstoppable Momentum,** Fright Train pounds away on Absolute Zero. He's almost out of the fight, but so are the Baron and Train.\n\nBaron Blade chooses to **Turn the Tables** on Absolute Zero, knocking the armored hero out of the fight. Before he passes out completely, Zero says \"It's in your hands now, Setback. God, we are so screwed.\"\n\nSetback performs a **Reckless Rush** driving the Baron through the window of the previously crashed monorail. He takes a Risk again, and shows himself to be a **Fumbling Fool.** This knocks away the radios that the Baron and Train were going to use to call in backup.\n\nBoth Baron and Fright Train approach Setback, ready to turn him to paste, but a sound from above causes him to smile.\n\n\"You guys forgot something very important.\" He takes a step out of the wrecked monorail train. \"The 10:30 express going the other way!\" He's already on the run, and Baron Blade and Fright Train are crushed under the force of another **Plummeting Monorail!**\n\nOf course, no bodies are found, so those villains will be back again. Setback brings Absolute Zero back to Freedom Tower to rest and recuperate.\n\nThe End.",

        "text": "This campaign is getting so ridiculous that at this point i have decided that I will start chronicling the adventures of the party i am currently DMing.\n\nIntroducing:  \n--Carric Firespear, the wiseguy Wizard that doesn't completely believe in magic, assuming that it is all just tricks. He was raised in an alienage and all of his friends and family in there where killed by bandits, leading to an intense hatred of them.  \n--Hafthulln Bjornsson, the Nordic Paladin who worships the god of law, Tyr, and tries to be a straight shooter, despite having to deal with Carric's antics. His entire tribe was destroyed by Frost Giants and he can't help but go into some kind of blood rage when he sees them.  \n--Limpbizkit Bindtwarden, the Gnome Bard whose name no-one truly knows and so he changes it almost every time the DM mispronounces yet.  \n--Aaitoire Surefist, the Elf who was raised in the Dwarven Continent as a monk from a young age. He tries to be a good person but is constantly interrupted by Carric.  \n--Vistra Fireforge, the Dwarfish Cleric who is adventuring with the party as a means of protection while collecting the tithe for her god.  \n\nThe session started with the party leaving the hill fort of Granite Peak, apart from Aaitoire and Vistra who stayed to train the villagers to protect themselves now that all of the men (more or less) are dead, to find the Orc Staging camp. As they traveled through the woods in the rough direction of where they thought the camp was, they came across a Dwarfish Druid named Gotrek Maulbeard who told the party that he was the protector of the forest and that he knew where the camp was and would help then destroy it.\n\n\nHe also made fun of Carric quite a bit, and more effectively than Carric did to the Dwarf, but that is a different story.\n\n\nThe group waited til nightfall after staking out the Orc Camp, which they believed contained about 15 Orcs and an Ogre that they had taken as a sort of \"Siege Beast\". As night fell, Carric and Bjorn snuck into the camp, released the Ogre, and proceeded to charm him into attacking his captors. A battle ensued where the party fought with the Ogre and Gotrek, who had turned into a Brown Bear and was decimating whatever he touched. After managing to clear out the camp, including a One-Eyed cleric Orc that forced Carric to drop to his knees and beg, they had a rest outside the camp before descending into the cave in the middle of the camp that they believed contained the wizard and his Spectator, a powerful beast that shoots magical rays from its many eye stalks.\n\n\nThey journeyed down into the cave and were met with a massive, dark, cavern that they proceeded to walk across. Carric threw a firebolt down the cavern to shed some light on the situation. As the bolt flew down the cavern, it briefly revealed a large, green, multiple eyed Spectator that began to shoot death rays at the party as they advanced. At the same time, a Necromancer appeared next to Carric and attempted to flay the skin from his body but failed. Limpbizkit was already on guard and quickly proceeded to create whispers inside the Necromancer's head, terrifying him and forcing him to flee back into the darkness.\n\n\nCarric stopped to shout to the beast and ask for its orders. It told Carric that he was not here to talk to a filthy half breed such as himself, to which Carric told him not to be a cunt. The spectator then fired multiple wounding rays at Carric who was instantly knocked out and flung across the room. While this happened, Bjorn and Gotrek ran towards the beast, attempting to attack it. As they approached however, the beast floated upwards into the darkness.\n\n\nLimpbizkit ran to Carric's aid and brought him back to the world of the living, Carric then threw a firebolt at the creature. A few seconds later, the Necromancer appeared once again and this time succeeded in flaying Carric's chest, knocking him unconscious and throwing him across the room. Again. \n\n\nThe beast, hidden in darkness, continued to fire wounding rays at Bjorn, knocking him out. Gotrek healed him back to consciousness. Meanwhile Carric and Limpbizkit decimated the Necromancer with their magic.\n\n\nAs soon as the Necromancer died, Carric shouted up to it, telling it that it's summoner was dead and that his task was complete. The beast told Carric that this was now his home and that they where trespassing. Carric proceeded to tell him that they would leave and never bother him but the beast was unsure as to whether he could trust them. Carric was frustrated and told the beast that in that case they would destroy him. Carric was then struck with both of the beasts wounding rays and was thrown across the room once more, knocking him unconscious. At the same time, Gotrek turned back into his normal self and used his magic to restrain the beast with roots that grew out of the roof.\n\n\nBjorn proceeded to throw a handaxe at the beast with the aid of Gotrek to guide his hand through the dark, the handaxe striking its jaw and shattering it. Limpbizkit healed Carric, again, and Carric threw his scorching rays at the beast in anger. The 3 physicists in the party then spent 5 minutes figuring out if Bjorn could throw the Dwarf up to the Spectator. He, sadly couldn't.\n\n\nThe beast broke its bonds and floated high up into the darkness where no-one could see it, firing wounding rays down upon Bjorn knocking him out. Carric, realizing that the beasts rays work through line of sight, crouched down and cast a minor illusion of a smoke cloud on himself. Gotrek followed his lead and dragged Bjorn towards Limpbizkit, casting a fog cloud on top of all 3 of them.\n\n\nCarric decided to run over to the fog cloud and threw a firebolt up into the darkness, miraculously hitting the beast and killing it.\n\n\nPart 2 of this session will be up as soon as i have finished writing it.",

        "text": "Long time no see, guys. Sorry it took so long, it's been a long time since these events took place, so I had to jog my memory for a bit. Now, without further ado, lets get on it!\n\nWe start in Nagoya, the home province of Oda Nobunaga, great unifier of Japan. Our heroes have been summoned here, as it were, by Nobunaga himself. However, each character starts off separate from the rest, each having to make their way to the castle where Oda Nobunaga is holding a feast. Upon arrival, the characters set themselves to joining the festivities. Bubba, being the chef character he is, immediately pulls aside the cook at the party and begins cooking chicken himself. My character is trying her hardest to be inconspicuous, as is Lee. Both of us being Ronin, we are looked down on by society, so we don’t want to draw too much attention to ourselves. Not to mention my character is a woman, and this is 16th century Japan. You’ve seen Mulan, you know what happens. (Yes, I know Mulan was Chinese, just roll with the analogy) Yamaha started mingling, as did the centipede samurai, who just so happened to lose track of his centipede. Which also happens to be venomous. Joy.\n\nOur group members then each individually set out to begin hunting the centipede. We eventually find it by Bubba. And it’s drooling all over the chicken. Drooling with its *poisonous saliva*, mind you. So, we then calm down the centipede and get it back to its master. Yay, problem solved! But then, some chicken goes out. Some of the *poisoned* chicken. And the plate with this foul fowl is headed to none other than Oda Nobunaga himself.\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n… oh shit.\n\nThanks in part to a good fortitude save on Nobunaga’s part, he survives *oh thank God!* He then demands the chef who would cook such horrendous chicken, and Bubba manages to convince the daimyo that it was the chef he took over for. Now, this event is kinda important, as it sets a precedent for how his character does things later on. It is after this that Oda Nobunaga pulls us aside into private chambers. He then tells us our mission – to spy on Kyoto for him. He then supplies us, and the next day we head out on our grand quest!",

        "text": "As has been previously established, I DM fast and loose when it comes to rules, except the Rule of Cool. I rigidly adhere to that. Thus, when somebody rolls double twenties, logic and reason fly out the window for something incredible to happen. I figure that such rolls are so rare that it's not much of a risk. But at our last Sunday, I learned the folly in my reasoning.\n\nAfter the session before this one, the party was short three members, so our sorcerer decides to search the city for interesting people to recruit. He rolls poorly, and I tell him he finds an interesting goat. He rolls to inspect why this goat is interesting. I chuckle, then watch the first double 20 of the session.\n\nFuck.\n\nI determine that the sorcerer has found Mjoll, king of the goats, and that as a reward for learning his secret, he gives the sorcerer his metaphorical crown; all goats in the world now recognize the sorcerer as their king. The session proceeds as normal. New party members are recruited, and a new mission is assigned: an invading army of demons nearby has mysteriously disappeared, and the local king fears that this could be a portent of something worse. So the party investigates (poorly) and ultimately finds a giant sinkhole. Everyone climbs or flies down, but the paladin opts to jump headfirst, hoping that his pauldrons will break his fall. I assume he's gonna snap his neck but let him roll. Second double 20 of the session.\n\nFuck II: The Refuckening.\n\nSo this cheeky son of a bitch gets his pauldrons imbued with the permanent ability to break any impact he takes head-first, regardless of the velocity he's travelling at, with no harm whatsoever to him. In any case, after some random NPC made a couple deals with Bazzracath, the friendly neighborhood bargain demon, the party was able to enter a pocket dimension to which the demon army had been taken. They take a few doors, and end up fighting three iron golems. Everyone rolls initiative, and the NPC werewolf gets a 20. And then another one. Third double 20 of the session on an initiative roll.\n\nFuck III: Revenge of the Fuck.\n\nSo the son of a bitch skips the enemies' first round and gets to act twice on each of his turns for that combat. As you can imagine, the foes are quickly dispatched, and it's time to loot. Paladin rolls a 98. So I tell the cheeky shit that he's found The Wabbajack. Everyone is pleased with this, as madness has returned. Later on, they decide to loot a broom closet, and everyone finds, predictably, brooms. Except our newly minted bard. Her player rolls a 100.\n\nFuck IV: Electric Boogaloo.\n\nAt this point I give up, throw my hands in the air, and decide this motherfucker gets The Jakkawab, an entirely new artifact created by the second Mad God, who came into being during last session's multiverse-fucking, which functions similarly to the Wabbajack but with an entirely new set of effects. I am crafting the tables for it as I speak.",

He flew back from the force of the hit, his back slamming into the wooden barricade around the edge of the arena. The crowd's cheers drowned out him out as he cursed himself for falling for such an obvious feint. He spat at the ground in front of his opponent. \n\"That was a pretty good hit for a milk maid.\" the Harlequin said getting to his feet.\n\nThe man, known by the crowd as 'Klug', lunged forward and threw a few wild punched vaguely in the direction of the Harlequin, which he managed to dodge with ease. The Harlequin's specialty was not exactly straight up 'honourable' fighting, he was more of a silent, '*stab you in the throat while you sleep*' kind of guy. He fired two punches into Klug's mid-section, who barely noticed, and sent a knee up to the Harlequin's chin, gaining some distance. Klug stood, catching his breath for a moment and charged forward. The Harlequin nimbly dodged to the side, planted a foot on Klug's lowed back, and pushed, sending Klug through the wooden barricade. Klug flopped to the ground and a nearby Dwarf declared him knocked out and the fight over. After making sure Klug wouldn't choke on his tongue he approached the Harlequin and handed him 3 silver pieces and another 2 for winning.\n\n\"Is that it?\" asked the Harlequin looking at the 5 coins in his palm.\n\n\"If you want more you're welcome to enter a death fight.\" The Dwarf replied, returning to attend Klug.\n\n\"You know what, this is fine.\" the harlequin said, closing his hand.\n\n\"I thought so.\" the Dwarf said, dragging Klug to a barrel in the corner.\n\nThe Harlequin pocketed the coin and waltzed over to the bar, trying not to make his limp from the fight too obvious. He sat down next to a man in black robes covered in bones while he waved down the barkeep for a drink.\n\n\"Unhappy with your winnings clown?\" The bone man asked, taking a bite of some meat he was holding.\n\n\"I was just expecting....more I guess. Ah well, it will get me a room and food for a week. Anyway, down to business. Who's our target?\"\n\n\"Mordai wants us to relieve the Captain of the guard from his position.\" The bone man replied.\n\n\"Simple enough, where is he.\"\n\nThe bone man pointed to a man in uniform, drinking loudly in a corner.\n\"Oh.... well that's convenient.\" The Harlequin said looking up, \"So what's the plan...\" he said looking back and noticing the Bone man was gone. \"Damn it Rattleshirt\"\n\n\n\nSo you know, this story is set **before** [The other one](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/30xcuj/the_harlequin_and_the_bear_man/) Called **The Harlequin and the Bear Man** and other stories coming will probably be in chronological order from Rattleshirt\n\nEdit 1: The bone man in this story is the same as in the last story because, chronologically, **The Harlequin and the Bear man** occurs after **Rattleshirt**",

        "text": "This is a continuation of a comically deranged all Dwarves campaign set in a hellish Mad Max style wasteland (which looks an awful lot like [this](http://jjpeabody.deviantart.com/art/Arid-Desert-Landscape-490369744)).\n\nPrevious Installments: \n\n [Chapter One: Alcoholics Make Terrible Miners](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2sg7ze/pathfinder_alcoholic_spelunking_an_all_dwarf_party/)\n\n[Chapter Two: Duergar-a-gogo](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2vc31u/pathfinder_alcoholic_spelunking_all_dwarves/)\n\n[Chapter Three: Siege Breakers &amp; Earth Shakers](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2xpf9r/pathfinder_alcoholic_spelunking_all_dwarves/)\n\n[Chapter Four: From Hell’s Heart I Bleed On Thee](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2z9vzo/pathfinder_alcoholic_spelunking_all_dwarves/)\n\n---\n\nSix young drunkards from the backwater mining town of Azamek set out into the wastelands on a mission: to reclaim an indefinite number of vaguely defined artifacts that belonged to various forgotten dwarven ancestors. The party roster currently as it currently stands:\n\n* Glorin Thunderbeard, a hippogriff-riding marksman who likes to throw tridents at things, and hates dragons.\n\n* Barazun the Beer Bane, Cleric of Hanseath, the Dwarven god of revelry and berserking. Weapon of choice is the Holy Headbutt.\n\n* Jozen Firebeard, a bagpipe maker with a knack for knowing tidbits of obscure lore while forgetting basic details about everyday life.\n\n* Sven Earthbreaker, a bartender with access to bizarre Lovecraftian magic and power over probability.\n\n* Dravona Goldspade, a blacksmith’s apprentice who dual-wields hammers, and is probably the sanest dwarf in the party.\n\n* Durgen Granitehand, the world's quietest NPC and official party mascot. Swings a hammer, but rarely hits anything.\n\nAfter instigating and winning a minor war with a Duergar settlement that happened to lie under their town, the six merry maniacs struck off into the wastelands on the advice of a talking painting and a slightly magic ring. Their destination: the Dwarven city of Kadharaz, from which no word has been received in thirty years or more. They made it exactly two days outside of town before everything went pear shaped. \n\nThe first morning any of them spent on the surface, Glorin (the party’s only survivalist) noticed fresh scat near the base of the rocky outcropping they’d camped on. A pugwampi gremlin was sniffing around it, but scampered off as the dwarves approached, and no one thought anything of it. As they marched on, ever so slowly through the wastes, Sven noticed buzzards circling on the far side of another rocky pile. Glorin spurred Rockbeak, his hippogriff mount, over to check it out, but found only hyenas gnawing on some long dead carcass, which scattered when they saw the flying beast approach. \n\nThe topic of finding their way home once they reached Kadharaz was broached, and then quickly followed up with the topic of finding Kadharaz in the first place, as they had no map and their only direction had been \"about three weeks Northeast.\" Jozen volunteered to keep a map, but as the party had neglected to bring any parchment or writing implements (needed the room for more beer), he had to settle for marking simple shapes on his bagpipes with charcoal and hoping he'd remember what they meant.\n\nNight fell without any more significant events...but on Jozen and Barazun’s watch shift, they noticed the faint flicker of illumination coming from the far side of another crag, and Barazun swore he could hear laughter. They awoke the rest of the party on the spot, and Barazun was convinced that light and laughter out here meant some sort of orcish celebration. When his comrades were skeptical, he added that maybe the orcs would have beer, which the dwarves were already running dishearteningly low on. The party agreed to investigate the matter more thoroughly in the morning. \n\nMorning brought only the remains of a campfire surrounded by hyena tracks, with ashes and blackened stones but curiously no wood. Jozen suggested that perhaps there had been a fire elemental here, and as he didn’t actually have any answers, proceeded to spin a wild lie about this being the legendary meeting place of all the various tribes of the wastelands, at which they held congress every ten years. His comrades ate it up. \n\nWith nothing better to do, the party went to harass the “orc dogs,” as they named the hyenas. Glorin got it into his head to have Rockbeak drop a boulder on one of them, and when they found a pair of hyenas skulking in the shade of a crag he proceeded to attempt exactly that. Which is precisely when everything went tits up. \n\nGlorin was fixated on dropping a rock on the hyena, so he pulled ahead of the other dwarves and landed on top of the rocky spike the “orc dogs” were shading behind, in the hopes of prying loose some stones to drop. This got the attention of the half a dozen gnolls that happened to be trying to sleep through the day, who began peppering Glorin with arrows. And so the valiant alcoholics sprang into action to aid their friend...very slowly, as dwarves don’t move quickly under the best of circumstances. \n\nBarazun, as is his habit, doubled in size while Jozen began to belt out his raging song. Dravona and Durgen advanced, hammers and axes at the ready, while Glorin tried to get the hell out of Dodge, only to come within range of a gnoll that seemed to hold a fire in its hand. As he turned to flee, the gnoll hurled the fire at the ranger, scorching him badly. Which is about when Sven began to chant in Aklo before turning into a white furred gnoll. \n\nThe hyenas ran straight at the advancing dwarves, but Barazun was already past them, and entered the fight by headbutting a gnoll to death in a single blow. The gnolls around him nocked arrows, but his increased size afforded him the opportunity to smash another of them before it had time to fire. The others shot him point blank and then ran as fast as their legs could move, scattering in all directions. \n\nDravona, Sven, and Durgen dealt with the hyenas, but the fire-wielding gnoll left something in her wake as she escaped, a fire elemental that set Barazun ablaze before Glorin could bring it down with the glaive he’d taken from the infernal several weeks past. As Sven tended the the cleric’s wounds, Glorin ran the gnoll down and executed him gruesomely.\n\nThe party reconvened at the rock spire the battle had occurred around, and while most of them went over the gnoll bodies looking for loot, Sven dragged the only still-living gnoll away from the rest and proceeded to sacrifice him violently to his eldritch masters. The resulting cloud vortex and beam of cold blue light suffusing his body with unholy power was enough to make the rest of the party walk several paces away from him for the rest of the day. \n\nThe following day was uneventful, save for Jozen sighting a sandstorm in the distance. Luckily it didn’t appear to be headed in their direction, so Glorin wrote it off as harmless. Near dusk they came upon the wreck of a chariot and a gnoll skeleton, both left bleached and brittle from years beneath the harsh desert sun. Sven smashed the gnoll skull, “just to be safe.”\n\nThat night Sven dreamed of a mountain crawling across a dry salt sea, swarming with living things and ringing out with the sounds of song and grinding metal. He saw his masters hanging in the sky, the Old Ones...and woke up to another day in the wastes, unsure of what it meant. \n\nSix days out of Azamek now, almost a third of the way through their trek, and near midday Glorin spotted what he thought to be more gnolls, keeping pace with the party about a half mile to the East. Jozen recalled a famous battle in which a few warriors had held off a much larger enemy force (forgetting that this was his own embellished story of the party’s victory in a Duergar siege a month previous) and the party found a pair of rocky spired that they could hunker between and fortify. Sven spread oil and caltrops liberally around the campsite while Glorin and Jozen took up sniping positions high up on one of the crags, Dravona and Durgen hid behind the other, and Barazun stood in the open, acting as bait. The dwarves waited for gnolls to appear...and appear they did, but not quite as expected. \n\nWhile five gnolls rushed out of the darkness from the East, bows drawn and shots forcing Jozen and Glorin to take cover, several chariots like the wreck they’d encountered the previous day burst out of the darkness...to the West. Drawn by a pair of hyenas each, the chariots had archers mounted behind the drivers, who shot at Barazun and retreated into the darkness before anyone could retaliate. Next came a larger chariot pulled by massive dire hyenas, an iron maiden bolted to the front holding a terrified gnome like an insane ship’s figurehead, carrying only the fire-wielding gnoll that had escaped the other day. The Fire Gnoll, as the party began to refer to her, threw a fireball at Barazun before she, too, was out of sight again. \n\nBarazun enlarged himself, Sven called up a fog bank to cover their position, and Glorin and Jozen shot at the gnolls advancing on foot. They reached Sven’s oil line, and he ignited it with a spark spell, catching all but one of them off guard and igniting their armor. Dravona and Durgen, meanwhile, readied their crossbows for the charioteers’ next pass, a plan forming. \n\nWhen the chariots came around again, the two of them aimed for the same hyena, their bolts bringing it down together. As the hyena dropped, the cart flipped and its passengers were thrown free. Barazun smiled, head above the fog, and strode up casually to deliver a killing headbutt to the driver as he tried to rise. The Fire Gnoll’s next pass threw a flaming sphere into the fog, but it missed anything important. \n\nThe gnolls advancing from the East, meanwhile, were having a rough time of things. After being pincushioned by Glorin and Jozen’s bolts, they’d been set on fire and then trapped in fog. Now, as they reached the caltrop line, they began to howl and take flight, wounded and limping. One made it through the fog to find itself directly behind Barazun, who smashed it out of the way with his hammer. Sven took the opportunity to step out of the fog bank and try to get a line on the Fire Gnoll.\n\nThe enemy was weakened, and Glorin went for the Fire Gnoll while Barazun laid waste to the rest of the pack. Rockbeak dropped down from above as the Fire Gnoll pulled her chariot about for another pass, and Glorin caught her with his glaive. Desperate, she turned her dire hyenas to charge at Sven and Dravona, and one of them managed to nearly disembowel the mad spellcaster. Dravona and Durgen employed the classic technique of ‘backpedal wildly while firing as many bolts as possible,’ and Jozen managed to drop one of the last chariot’s hyenas with a bolt, flinging the driver sideways while the archer pulled a miraculous roll to come up on his feet and put an arrow straight into Barazun’s belly. \n\nGlorin swooped to the rescue, catching the Legolas Gnoll from behind and severing its head cleanly with his glaive. Seeing that her dire hyenas were all that stood between her and the dwarves, the Fire Gnoll attempted to flee once again. But Barazun had other plans. Imbuing his throwing shield with the might of his god, he hurled the disk a hundred feet across the desert...where it smashed cleanly into the runaway gnoll’s skull, killing her instantly. Dravona and Durgen dispatched one of the dire hyenas, and Glorin distracted the other with gnoll meat long enough to free the gnome imprisoned on the chariot’s prow. \n\n\nWounded and exhausted, the dwarves fell back to their makeshift bulwark. After the gnome had been revived, she introduced herself as Fijit Farwalker, freelance cartographer of the wastes, and asked pointedly why the party's only map was a crude sketch on the side of Jozen's bagpipe. She revealed that she had been mapping the wastelands when the gnolls captured her, only surviving by convincing the gnoll alpha that gnomes could see the future. In exchange for the safety of travelling with a group, Fijit promised to guide the party to where they were going. \n\nBright and early the next morning, the dwarves set about repairing the chariots and attempting to win the loyalty of the hyenas. They were understandably excited to cut a week or more off their travel time each way, despite Fijit's warnings that if they wanted to reach their destination quickly, they had two basic choices: cut through the territory of a local dragon that commanded a gnoll pack many times larger than the one they had just faced, or go around and into that sandstorm they'd sighted days ago. \n\nIt remains to be seen just how crazy these dwarves really are.

        "text": "The campaign I play in is built around the king of the realm putting together a paramilitary party of adventurers for the purpose of finding a number of powerful magical relics. The DM admitted that the campaign was based heavily on the anime series Legend of the Legendary Heroes. I wish I was making up that name. It's on Netflix.\n\nAs tends to happen, most of the group decided to be Elves because of their Dexterity bonus. First, there's Ren, the Wood Elf fighter-that's-really-a-ranger, complete with the raised-by-wolves backstory. She doesn't quite understand human social norms, and has trouble interacting with people. She's also one of the best archers I've ever known, better, in fact, than the party's actual ranger. She's played by a man who's been playing for quite a while.\n\nNext is the actual ranger. Her name is Helja (pronounced Hell-yuh), and she's a dwarf. She's also withdrawn, but that's because she's played by a woman who's pretty new to 5e, and tends to have trouble with the mechanics. That said, she's quite enthusiastic, and plays Helja's mistrust of people quite well. \n\nThe party bard is a half-elf named Eigen Fun-shin (pronounced Eigen Function, yes we're all nerds). He is one of the more interesting character concepts I've come across. He decided that his character would be mute, and communicate entirely with the Message cantrip. This led to many wonderful moments when he tries to talk to someone outside the party, and they think they're going insane, hearing voices in their head. It also means that, in combat, he has to spend his entire turn to communicate with the party.\n\nMy character is Charybdis the Half-Orc paladin. She used to be the chief of an Orc tribe, but got sick of the stigma the world associates with Orcs. She eventually left the tribe, took up Gond's blessing, and set out to help the world accept Orcs. She took up the Protection fighting style, hoping to earn her allies' favor by defending them. She also hopes to show Orcs how to get along with other races better. I'm fairly new, so Charybdis is far from optimized for anything.\n\nThe party's other paladin is a Half-Elf named Tariel (Yes, a letter away from Tauriel. He had previously built a druid named Mithrandir. This is what happens when LOTR fans play D&amp;D.) Now, Tariel is played by a guy who's been playing for a while, and gotten VERY good at character creation and optimization. His paladin could easily beat up mine, and Tariel knows it. Tariel also decided that he hates Orcs. The role-play of this was fun enough that we all tolerated it. What was more annoying was his habit of regularly mentioning Mithrandir in out-of-character conversation, routinely suggesting bringing him in or mentioning that Mithrandir would do well in this situation.\n\nThe warlock was a Half-elf named Tanya. She was fairly weak of body and spirit, easily influenced by her friends. She was also quite a pyromaniac, learning almost exclusively fire-based spells. Furthermore, she was fiercely patriotic. Her player had some experience, and played Tanya quite well. \n\nWe were all serving in the military of the nation of Drexel. Our Commanding Officer (CO) told us that His Highness wanted to put together a special, not-quite-official division to hunt down ancient, extremely powerful artifacts. Drexel's neighbor to the north, York, was beginning to hear the first hints of revolution from the Diven States, the occupied territory that used to be another nation before the Great War. So, we were tracking down these artifacts before they could fall into the wrong hands. The king gave us a blank check to support our operations, and the full power of the Drexelian Royal library's vast archives. We decided to call our party Foxglove.\n\nOver the course of several missions, our characters developed quite well. I quickly stopped considering Tariel a paladin. He acted more like a barbarian with some divine magic, always rushing in while the rest of the party was still putting together a plan of action. (Intelligence and Wisdom were his dump stats.) At one point, he rushed headfirst into a darkened room from which could be heard the sounds of Orcish conversation. I was going to try to talk to them, but Tariel broached hostilities first. As it turned out, there were about five orcs in there. As soon as he entered, every single orc in the room shot him, and he went down. I had to run in there, taking several arrow shots myself, and drag his dumb ass back out of the room to heal up. The rest of the party definitely liked Charybdis more than Tariel. Ren explicitly stated that, if push came to shove, she would side with Charybdis. At one point, someone suggested that Foxglove needed a leader. I piped up \"Yeah! Someone who shows courage tempered by caution. Someone who plans ahead, someone who puts the mission first. Someone like Helja.\" Out-of-character, she looked up from her sheet and at me, with a shocked \"What?!\" I told her that she would be a great leader. She responded that no, if anyone, our leader should be Charybdis. At this point, the DM reminded us that we had a CO already. \n\nSince I'm actually male, everyone regularly forgot that Charybdis was female. Eventually, I began to keep track of the number of times this happened. When it had happened n times, my response was \"For the nth time this month, I am female!\" Often, Tariel would respond with a comment along the lines of \"She's so ugly, what's the difference?\" I made Charybdis give him an unamused look, then burst out laughing out-of-character.\n\nAs the difficulty of our quests ramped up, so too did the political situation continue its slow boil. Eventually, a small town in the Diven States revolted against its occupying York forces, and the rebellion began. Our CO transferred us to the front lines, as part of Drexel's aid to York. The new CO told us to go the Diven States, posing as commoners, and recover an artifact before the rebels could find it. The path took us through a forest.\n\nAs we hiked between the trees, the sounds of the forest began to change. First came the rustling, slowly growing more and more ominous. Then we started seeing faces in the leaves, and human forms among the trunks of the trees. As the party struggled to ignore these apparitions, the human figures began getting bolder, and gesturing at the party invitingly. However, they didn't seem to realize that four of the party members were female, all heterosexual. Helja gestured back sarcastically, and Charybdis shouted \"Sorry, I don't swing that way.\" Eventually, one stepped out onto the path. Ren fired a warning shot at her feet.\n\nWhen the arrow buried itself in the ground in front of the figure, the surrounding forest grew tangibly colder and deathly silent. The figure growled at the party, then withdrew. A rock flew out of nowhere, and nearly killed Tanya. At this point, the party saw a tree stand up, and begin walking towards them. Then another, and another. Three Treants were bearing down on the party. Three wooden behemoths, denoted Siege Monsters in the Monster Manual, large enough to use castles as punching bags, intent on the five of us. We began running.\n\nAs the party tried to run past the first Treant, it kept knocking us back, very nearly one-shotting all of us. I knew this was hopeless. The party could probably run past the other two, since they weren't quite on the path. However, this one would most likely kill us all. I looked around at the party, and said \"Goodbye, Foxglove. It's been an honor.\" I grabbed Tariel's leg as he prepared to ride away, looked him in the eye, and said \"Remember me for this.\" Then I cast Compelled Duel on the Treant, and began running the opposite direction. The last the party saw of me was a retreating form running back down the path, quickly obscured by a wooden behemoth running after her.\n\nA farmer living near the edge of the forest found the rest of the party, and led them back to his home. As they settled in and talked with him, they mentioned in passing that they had had another companion, who had died to the Treants. Everyone remembered to refer to Charybdis as female this time. Tariel commented that it was just as well, at least they were rid of the Orc now. Ren piped up \"At this point, I'm going to punch him.\" This tiny, wiry little elf walked up to this tremendously strong, armored Paladin and punched him in the face, out of loyalty to her fallen friend. \"She died for us!\"",

        "text": "^(The system tag refers to the World of Warcraft Tabletop RPG^4, which is based on some variation of DnD 3e rules.)\n\nSome years ago I tried my hand in DMing and decided to run a session at an upcoming con. I borrowed two players and the DM from our then recently finished Mountains of Madness campaign (which we ran in seven consecutive days for maximum player madness) and prepared characters with them, so we could quickly start with the session at the con, though I also expected one or two strangers to join. The adventure I had planned was for level five characters, so of course they convinced me to upgrade it to level seven, so they could take all those awesome feats in the rulebook. At that point I made a grave mistake and casually mentioned that there were additional source books and the rules were compatible with pretty much any DnD 3e source. Never say that.\n\n***\n\nOne of the player was playing one of the twin characters I had lying around^1, another was content with playing a full sized ogre^2 (none of that halfbreed stuff) and the third approached me with a blood elf necromancer.\n\n***\n\nMe: Uh, were did you get that?\n\nHim: Here, it's right there in this rulebook.\n\nMe: So it is. Well, alright. But did you read that mandatory LE alignment?\n\nHim: Yup.\n\nMe: Well, then the rest of the party will want your head.\n\nHim: Only if they know.\n\nMe: Of course. Well, it does play nicely into the start of the adventure, as you will be meeting the others in a prison. Can you give me quick a rundown of your character's ability?\n\nHim: Sure, it starts with this [generic magic stuff] and due to this feat I can permanently raise two undead creatures of this class. I chose two dragons.\n\nMe: What?! There are dragons in that creature class?\n\nHim: Well, small ones. Anyway, they are both level five, so it is not unexpected that I may have encountered, slain and raised both of the dragons.\n\nMe. Hm. Well, since it's in the book... But you can't have them anywhere near you, they must remain beyond the horizon. Fifteen minutes to call them, plus five rounds to get into melee range.\n\nHim: Sure, I can live with that.\n\n***\n\nLater at the con we got indeed two other players, one playing the other twin^3 and another rolled up a troll priest on the spot. Introductions were made, the adventure set on path and the merry group went on their way to reaquire an outpost from those wretched dwarves. I duly noted that travel is much more fun for the players when language barriers are strictly enforced.\n\nThe first encounter was a nest of harpies who blocked the shortest way to the outpost and, as such, of course had to be quickly erradicated lest they inconvenience the players. At that point I realized that I had seriously underestimated the characters' strength. The Big Boss Harpy landed only one hit on Yoda, then was literally plucked out of the sky by the ogre and the other harpies were mere decoration to the fight.\n\nAs the adventure was designed to be short, they quickly arrived at the outpost. The blood elf convinced the others to wait to dusk, so she could call on the dragons in advance to minimize waiting time. I allowed for them to approach to a one minute approach time as the outpost was at a mountain side.\n\nAs dusk came, they attacked and quickly dispatched even the quickly-leveled-up-and-beefed-up-guards. I literally conjured up additional enemies to where the characters couldn't see, but it wasn't enough. At least the squishier group members took some minor damage, but overall the outpost was conquered without problem. So as the players celebrated a victory, the two dragons emerged from the mountaintop and swooped down. \n\n***\n\nThem: Oh, now those are the actual enemies of this encounter!\n\nMe: Actually, those are not mine.\n\nThem: What.\n\n***\n\nThe troll priest got the short straw and was killed in two rounds, the ogre being next as the dragons ganged up on him. The blood elf herself wasn't all that threatening, but managed to keep the twins busy. In the end, one dragon was down, the other non-functional, the ogre dead, Yoda dead and the blood elf faced off the badly injured other twin.\n\n***\n\nThen, her player looked at the map:\n\nHim: Wait, I'm carrying a barrel of blackpowder, right?\n\nMe: Yes, as part of the ammunition for your mortar.\n\nHim: I have it on my person? I have the packrat feat, I can easily carry it.\n\nMe: Well you certainly didn't leave it standing next to the camp-fire. [Troll priest] made sure of that.\n\nHim: Cool. I light it. With my flintlocks.\n\nBlood Elf: Wait, wait, you're right next to me!\n\nHim: And you just wiped out the party. I'm just finishing the job.\n\n***\n\nIn wise precaution I had a table for explosions of blackpowder handy. It did indeed do the job.\n\n***\n\n^1 To give you a taste: A goblin dual-wielding flintlock pistols as main weapons. Secondary weapon? *A mortar.*\n\n^2 Strength of 20, Intelligence of 5, Reach of 4 squares with a big spear\n\n^3 Dual-wielding rapiers with all possible bonuses. Think Yoda with two lightsabres.\n\n^4 [http://www.wowwiki.com/Warcraft_RPG](http://www.wowwiki.com/Warcraft_RPG)",

        "text": "**The Setting:**  \nGallopavo Shipping Company is a mini-campaign, a vignette meant to be the backstory for flavor-text for a larger campaign... Yeah... It was intended to last 3 sessions/weeks, but wound up \"lasting\" 5 weeks, because we had to skip a week due to low attendance. It lasted 4 because the GM underestimated how long the combat would take. Anywho, the PC's are hired by a company known as Gallopavo Shipping Company in order to protect a shipment of mail, packages, and a large crate containing a statue of a mayor. Sort of bodyguards/delivery boys.\n\n**The Party:**\n\n\n* Baldric Variel (Myself): Human Bard, plays a masterwork violin. Good at playing the violin and that's about it.\n\n* Lucius Lasunder: Human Alchemist, he specialized in blowing shit up.\n\n* Henry Eisen: Human Inquisitor of Abadar. Almost died, but didn't thanks to a miscommunication between the GM and the player.\n\n* Emily: A small orphan girl who follows Henry around. Magically talented. Smacked people with a CLW wand when needed.\n\n* Ricard Ontenette: Human Fighter. Was great in combat, scoring the most kills... I think. Resident sunder-monkey. Saved the party's bacon during the second encounter in the campaign.\n\n* Theno: Halfling Driver. DMPC that drove the mail cart. Surprisingly good with a light crossbow. Abrasive and cynical.\n\n* The final PC, Zadok Eleazar, was only around for the first 2 sessions. He was a Half-Elf Fighter. GM claimed he was sucked into the Realm of Adventure due to the lack of attendance, I personally think we just left him on the roof of an inn/rest stop we stopped at for the night (I'll get to this later).\n\n**The Story**  \nBaldric was the first to arrive in the Gallopavo Shipping Company lobby. The lobby is nicely furnished with some fine, comfortable chairs and potted plant here and there. Opposite the double door entrance is a desk for a receptionist, however, the chair behind it is empty. There is some light music playing, but Baldric doesn't care for it.   \nHe finds a seat near the receptionist's desk and pulls out his violin and begins playing so he can drown out the music being played by the company.  \nThis is how Ricard finds the lobby when he quietly enters. He sits down closer to the doors, but says nothing.  \nNot long after, a filthy man in a long dark coat enters and sits in one of the chairs, sullying it for all eternity. He pays little attention to the swordsman, but eyes the bard's violin greedily, wondering how much he could get if he stole it.  \nRicard, having been mesmerized by the music, finally finds his manners and introduces himself and tells a little about why he joined up for this outing.  \nBaldric, suddenly realizing there were people in the room, falters in his performance, stops and then starts up another song, but soon stops playing because he realized that Ricard spoke to him (that slow reaaction time, amirite?). Baldric greets Ricard and offers up his name.  \nBefore Lucius can properly, or as properly as Lucius can, introduce himself, Henry enters, followed closely by Emily. Having heard Baldric's music from the street, they enter with Henry quizzing Emily on the song and it's composer. Henry, who was quite the music connoisseur, complimented Baldric on his performance, suggesting he quit adventuring and join an orchestra.  \nAfter the Henry enters, Lucius comments on Henry's fine attire, questioning its practicality for travel, and then properly introduces himself with, \"Pleasure to meet you and all that. Name's Lucius Lasunder. My friends call me Lu.\" He was, of course, lying. Lucius, being a drug dealer, was lying. He didn't have friends, he had clients.  \nIgnoring the Inquisitor and his small squire, begin a conversation about music and magic, wherein Baldric reveals he is a Bard and Lucius an Alchemist.  \nTheir conversation is interrupted by the entrance of their fifth and final compatriot, Zadok. Zadok, being rather gruff (and lacking in the CHA department), gives his name and asks the gathered group who they are. (Author's Note: At some point prior to Zadok's entrance, Henry and Emily introduced themselves.)  \nBaldric, being the ever-friendly and outgoing fellow that he is, stands and introduces himself, \"Baldric Variel of Casterly Bay. These two fine fellows are Henry and Ricard. The young lady is Emily. The other, not-so-fine fellow is Lucius.\" Baldric then extends his hand towards Zadok, which he takes and attempts to crush as a test of the \"hardness\" of Baldric, which Baldric attempts to match, earning some respect from Zadok.  \nTaking offense at his introduction, Lucius replies, \"Don't listen to Baldric. I'm a honest craftsman of potions and hardworking entrepreneur! I just travel a lot, tis all. You'd be all nasty too if the road was yer home.\"  \nBaldric retorts, \"The road is my home and yet I do not smell of everything I have ever seen. Enough of this.\" At this point, Baldric casts Prestigitation, using it to clean up Lucius. \"And yet, the smell still lingers.\" sighs Baldric.  \nSurprised at his sudden cleanliness, Lucius thanks Baldric and begins muttering about finding a way to bottle it up so he can sell it as a detergent. Unfortunately for Lucius, Baldric's comment about the smell piques the interest of Emily. She exclaims that she can make him smell better and casts Create Water over Lucius, completely drenching him. She giggles, but is quickly smacked on the back of the head by Henry, who appologizes for his charge's rash actions.  \nBefore returning to his chair, Baldric casts Prestidigitation again to dry off Lucius. Once returned to his seat, Baldric begins playing again.  \nAfter that, nothing much happens except for some minor banter. The group chats while the bard plays, until the owner of GSC enters the room and introduces himself.\n\n**Post Scriptum**  \nIt is at this point that the first session picks up. Everything before took place on a forum in a Play by Post style. Despite how long this is, this is a rather cutdown version of what transpired. I could copy and paste over the posts if anyone wanted to read the full thing. Henry's player alone create a massive wall of text just about him and Emily entering the lobby. LOL.  \nAnyways, till next time.",

James Champion went to look more closely at the car only to disappear in a flash of light, later revealed to be an alien flash-bang grenade. \n\nUnphased by their partner's sudden disappearance, John Dang and Old Man Jenkins quickly discover and follow an inhuman set of footprints to an alien spacecraft.

John stealthily sneaks through the alien ship, while Old Man Jenkins happily strolled about choking every alien in his path to death.

During the scuffle that insured, Old Man Jenkins attacked the orderlies using an alien corpse as an improvised club. Finally the Lake Forge Inspectres did what any sane man in that situation would do, they cheesed it into the woods leaving the asylum workers with the only proof of their sanity (they ditched the alien corpses) and a bunch of bruises. \n\nI have yet to run Inspectres again but when I do, the stories will wind up here.",

        "text": " ( pretty awesome dungeonworld oneshot, tale is told in a quite subjective re-narration by my character )\n\nI've got SUCH a headache. For the love of Eidyia..... Well ,let's start at the beginning. Just a simple tavern in a simple town in the kingdom of xxx, some dragonfolk live here. But eh, gotta start your search somewhere . so we were just sitting there, minding our own business and of course a couple of barbarian orcs trying to hit on us. Us, that's Aisha, the weird rangergirl with her giant pet tiger, Biggs, the twitchy halfling and a rather blank fighter guy. We've been on the road together for a couple of weeks by now, so I knew how much to trust and rely on these guys. Not farther than I could throw any of them. And I suck at throwing stuff. Anyway, orcs trying to make a pass on Blondie and the crazy halfling out of the blue stabbed the guy. Guess I could have seen that one coming. So we got a dead orc on the ground and his orcfriends obviously are about to drop their shit. I tell you. This headache is gonna kill me. So I rose the guy from the dead, acted like everything is fine and let him sit next to me. Orcfriends started to cheer and everyone was happy I guess. Oh yeah, I can reanimate corpses. Did I fail to mention that in my last letter ? Sorry sis. On the plus side, I have a big zombieorc to carry my stuff now. Though apparently the little show drew the attention of a few of the dragonfolk soldiers on us who were stationed in that town I guess. Big chief-kinda-guy approached me and pressed his legion-badge into my face, guess he wanted to cause us trouble. Some so-and-so much legions, dragonarmy, bla. The usual. 'So where's your secret tattoo all the cool guys have?' I asked him. He looked at me like I just made that up (which of course I did. Surrounded by idiots, I told you ) too embarrassed to admit his lack of knowledge he caved in and all is fine again. Except for , of course, it wasn't. The brain-dead rangergirl started to ask where dragon babies come from.... Like, seriously? My headache is killing me at that point and it wouldn't be far worse if I'd actually bang my head against the table. I just left at that point. Hell do I care if she gets torn to shreds. The fighter, Gunderson, chose to follow me. He does show signs of brain activity after all. We knocked on some doors for a place to sleep and Gunderson managed to get us beds in a nice ladies house. He also did get some , so, nice for him. My zombieorc Knut, or Kanot, or whatever his former name was, kept guard . I'm really growing fond of him. Doesn't talk, does as he's told, is not causing any trouble. Talking about Knut, not Gunderson, if that wasn't clear.\n\nThe next morning started out quite interesting. Some red dragon 'Firestorm' gathered quite the army at the outskirts of town. Nice show we got to witness. Especially after a wizard suddenly appeared in the middle of their forces and started to rip them apart like nothing I've ever seen. Then, as fast as he appeared he was gone. Leaving behind hundreds of dead and mutilated bodies. One of the remaining officers asked me to deliver a letter to xxx, the capital. Promised some nice amount of coin, so who am I to refuse to help those poor soldiers. I looked around for a bit and found a badge of command on a body and a nice corpse of a horse I was able to reanimate. She was missing a bit of face, but with a little magical makeup no one would notice. I called her Natasha. While I did those things in a rather discrete fashion, guess what the idiot halfling rogue did. Yupp. Looting the dead. Such a goddamn wildcard. Anyways, to all our surprise the remaining soldiers weren't too fond of this sacrilege. Who would have though. Anyone? No? Fine, whatever. Idiot gets chased, idiot gets caught, Miranda's gotta help that little shit again. So I created a distraction and we all managed to escape. At some point I gotta ditch those morons or bad things will happen. Oh right, future Miranda, give me the I told you so .. Funny...\n\nFew days on the road to the capital, at least I had a horse now. Nothing weird could happen here, right? Sigh.. So the weirdest shit happened: suddenly a naked goblin accompanied us. No clue where he came from but he didn't say anything but hello. In that god awful high pitched voice. I told you about my ever growing headache right? So that goblin just rode with us, all the time asking for food. If he wouldn't get any he'd get pissy and thunderclouds literally would appear above us. I tried to let my orcpal hit him but the goblingthingy just made my zombies hand disappear. Got it. Strange incredibly powerful batshitcrazy goblin. Better play along for now. Next day we heard some people ahead of us. Merchants maybe. Way layers more likely. Let the crazy ranger-rogue duo deal with that. Gunderson and I took another path to the capital. Did we get rid of them? If only. Couple minutes later some random guy with an arrow in his back rushed past us on a horse cart, chased by our very halfling on another cart. They seemed to have fun so who am I to judge. Pretty sure we would meet them somewhere in the capital. Sadly I wasn't wrong. I parked my best friends Knut and Natasha in a local stable where we met Aisha, who told us something about tons of gold and a three-day party marathon Biggs was doing. Really couldn't care less.\n\nSince our rations all went into a bottomless pit that is the goblins mouth we had to get some money for food and shelter. Good thing we were promised some money for delivering that letter. We left the goblin with Knut and the animals and made our way to the great castle, which was rising proudly above the midst of the capital. Luckily there was no sign of the halfling. We approached the gate and got welcomed by some grim dragonfolk guards. Not as much welcomed as rudely stopped in our path. We explained the letter story, though those two weren't accommodating at all. Guess sometimes you gotta push a little. I charmed on of them with a bit of sweet talk and he let us in without a problem. The captain we gave the letter to didn't say much. The letter wasn't more than a report of the wizards attack. Though we would be rewarded for further information on that bad guy. Couldn't care less. Money was to be received outside by one of his of subordinates. I just want to say outright that I don't care much for money. You obviously need it to get food and a place to stay so I'm kind of depended on getting paid for the work I do. I don't care if I get rich by doing so, I have other motivations. But! If a contract is made, and a reward is promised, then I better not get screwed over after the work is done. We were promised 150 gold pieces for delivering the letter. The grumpy officer with the chest of money gave us 80 pieces. Now even the less smart, like, let's say, Biggs, would understand that 80 does not equal 150. Arguing about this discrepancy were to no avail, though we were offered to fill our bags in their pantry. Oh, how very generous. They would soon learn that it has consequences to not uphold s bargain made with yours truly.\nBack at the stables the fighter dove into the food he got like he hasn't had anything to eat in days. Now that I think of it the goblin probably ate all his food and he did not eat in days. The tales of the pantry made the goblins eyes widen with excitement though. How much harm could a little hungry goblin probably do to a great castle's pantry. A little hungry magically incredibly powerful goblin. Wouldn't it be Irresponsible though to let such a menace get loose into the nice pantry of the nice dragon people. The nice dragon people who cheated me out of the money that belonged to me. On the other hand, it would be pretty irresponsible to let s poor little goblin starve to death. I really couldn't bear his big sad eyes. Also don't fucking screw me over you dirty little lizardpeople!\nBack to the castle I went. Little goblin with me. One of the guards, still charmed by my outstanding personality, or maybe the charm spell, who could really tell? Was eager to let me into the castle again. His buddy not so much. Please, boys, don't fight over me. They did. My new friend won and I passed him and his bloodied sword with an impish smirk. Once inside I let the little bugger loose in the pantry and made sure to get out of the castle before anyone could see me. The lonely guard outside went a bit overboard with his smitten act. To be honest, the killing his pal part might have been an indicator. He followed me and tried to pull me into a dark alley. I thought about slitting his throat with a dagger though I never really was a fan of physical violence. At least not done by myself. I rather let do. Anyway, I chose the smarter approach and showed him the badge I got from one of the officers a few days back. He ran off pretty quickly after that.\nYou'll see what you will get for messing with me, I muttered as I made my way back to the stables.\n\nWe kinda went into a tavern and reunited with the now drunk halfling. I really wasn't in the mood of enduring more of their shenanigans so I went for a bit of peace and quiet in the halls of my church. There was a temple of Eidyia close by so I made my way there. It was a nice little temple with maybe twenty to thirty clerics. I experienced a warm welcome as I expect from my brothers and sisters of my church and I went for a tranquil place in one of the aisles for a prayer. Just a few moments of uninterrupted prayer. Shouldn't really be to much to ask for. But there are these idiots I know. I heard a lot of arguing coming from outside and all of a sudden Aisha dove straight through the hall and out of a window. I could not believe my eyes. What in Eidyia's name was this little nutjob doing in my church? Okay, so she obviously followed me. But why? Just why? If she wants to go to a church there are countless other open churches around. Was it just to annoy me? Not unlikely. God, this much imbecility just hurts. Better not think too much about it I was telling myself as I slowly massaged my temples. It was quiet for a bit afterwards. Heavenly quiet.\nAnd then it all happened:\nSomeone screamed outside. It was a horrific scream of pain and terror. The windows of the church broke and bottles of fire flew into the hall, exploding on impact. People started to panic and ran aimlessly into all directions. Those heading for the main door got stopped in their tracks as tongues of fire came hissing through the wooden cracks of the heavy oak door. More disturbing than the screams of fear and agony though was the maniac laughter coming from outside. 'I will fucking kill them. I'm gonna rip out their beating hearts and make them eat em'. I tried to send all the priests and clerics down into the basement into safety before I made my way out through a side door .I couldn't quite believe that the morons were actually capable of such a random and at the same time sacrileges act but I would make sure it was the last time. As I walked out through fire and burned corpses I spotted the crazy imbecile named Aisha. She was just about to throw two more flasks of what I assumed to be alchemical fire. I can't tell if it was for my sudden appearance or her own stupidity but the flasks exploded in her arms. She lit up like a torch and at the sounds of the approaching guards she started to run into the crowd. Having a screaming and burning crazy lady running towards them, the people jumped out of her way, leaving her no chance to disappear. I was close behind her but she was faster and about to get away. The guards still a couple of feet behind me. Had to act fast. I casted an image of the deepest and most horrific scenery of the void upon a chair that was in her way. The visions of horror made her turn on her heels but instead of running straight towards the guards and myself she made a sharp turn and jumped into a shopwindow. She really has lost the last of her marbles. I tried to tackle the burning girl but she was a step too fast and made her way up to the roof. A few rooftops, missteps and fallen guards later I had cornered Aisha. She tried to jump but slipped, barely keeping a hold of the gutter. I leaned forward. I just wanted to know the reason for this irrational act of savagery. She wouldn't answer me. She did however blame Biggs to be the mastermind behind all of it. Hard to believe since the little halfling has the intelligence of a dead mouse but throwing fire at random stuff surely fit his style. I stared at Aisha but before I could throw her off the roof she let go of it herself and fell to her death.\nThe remaining guards arrived and I told them about the devious halfling. We were just about to descent from the roof as the city was quaked by an enormous explosion. Blazing pillars of flame erupted where the castle used to stand. 'Hmm', I thought to myself 'the goblin did quite some work.'\n'Do you see what happens to people who mess with me?' I said in a dark and momentous tone as I slowly made my way down to the charred remains of what used to be a rather crazy human girl. 'I'm gonna make you pay, you little bitch,' I whispered to her as I scenically started to raise up her body. The burned flesh retracted to make space for a cold and inhuman skin covering Aisha's new beautiful and expressionless face with eyes as blank as an empty piece of parchment.\n'Aah, finally silence' I said in joy as I walked with my new toy through the masses of shouting and screaming citizens and soldiers back to our tavern. 'Now for that little halfling'..",

The planet itself is Jupiter sized large and fully frozen during Pre-Scream it was a luscious climate controlled water world with a few small islands dotted around and one floating city. But after the Scream almost all the population was decimated, the planet climate control devices fell into disrepair and the planet finally fell into its current frozen state, the floating city fell into the city swallowed by the ice. But now its re-inhabited by billions of people in bubble cities all over the globe salvaged from tech found in the ice and from tech brought in by the Imani Megacorp. Now the bubble cities ar full with skyscrapers in the middle bottoming out to higher class housing all around and underneath the surface of the planet and the cities have been dug massive subterranean caverns miles and miles across and deep. these are full of housing districts and the backbone of the industry using the thick ice to cool the machinery and to melt it down for water. using huge holes cut into the ice to vent the steam and heat from underground some of these steam plumes can be seen from space (imagine Jupiters volcanic moon Io)\n\n \n\n**Camera focuses down and into the planet**\n\nAs we zoom down into the planet we see the back of two people stood outside a seedy bar in the underbelly of one of the subterranean cities next to the spaceport, we pan round and into the faces of Clyve and Boris as they walk into the bar.\n\n \n\nThere is a small amount of people inside, a lone barman cleaning uncleanable dirty glasses behind the bar and the man they are looking for is in the corner they wander over him wary of the silence of the place clyve strides over puts out his hand and says \"osias I presume?\" the man looks up from his drink he has been nursing to the hand and to the face of the man it belongs too squinting into it he nods to the barman and takes his hand \"I am and you are?\" Osias seems suspicious of the two but thats mostly from a inset suspicion of offworlders that have come to the prosperous Adlia looking for work. The barman arrives and puts two drinks in front of clyve and boris in dirty looking glasses. Boris and Osias also shake hands making introductions making idle chit chat as two men walk in behind them.\n\n \n\nOne of these two men is in full business suit with a small Imani Megacorp emblem on the front of his lapel, and the other is a mining looking gentleman in full overalls and grease on his hands and face, this man approaches the group first with the other standing a respectful distance away... but enough to listen in. the man sticks out his hand in a southern drawl says to the group \"I'm Mr.Grief don't mind the name plenty others don't, I represent the mining company 'The Spiker Society' and we have a job for you when you pick up your ship\" all the group but Osias shake his hand and ask what it is. he explains that several ships of theirs have gone missing in sector 504 Katla around the planet Bernaldez. and would now like to hear a seperate ship to transport some mining equipment to a moon orbiting bernaldez hoping a ship not with the company would maybe throw off whatever is taking their ships, they also ask that if they can find the last ship lost and take its cargo then they will double the money. with this Mr.Grief leaves and the Imani representative steps forward and goes by the name of Mr. Bouza and explains to Osias directly that the meeting to finalise the deal is in one hour and not to be late and leaves. and with this Osias encourages the group to drink up the drinks he bought them. (and through a incredibly bad physical effects saves roll of 1) Boris takes a swig and instantly runs to the bathroom to throw up. Clyve on the other hand downs his drink.\n\n \n\nAfter Boris cleans up they take the freight elevator to the surface city where the skyscraper of Imani Megacorp stands tall and proud in the center of the city. Outside is crew member number 4 Kim Su waiting for the group, as the crew approaches them he steps forward and shakes each hand with a casualness he introduces himself but purposefully does not yet mention his MES. as the group make introductions the walk into the Lobby of Imani Megacorp as they walk in too the black marble lobby there are no desks no chairs to sit just multiple elevators all marked with different sections of the business ranging from \"finance\", \"Business Deals\", \"Public Relations\", \"corporation meetings\" etc every elevator has a certain function. The group take the \"Business Deals\" elevator to floor 405 and get out to a single room marked with a door saying \"Aethers Gift\" the group talk amongst themselves and let Clyve go in to make the deal as he is the only one with business expertise. as he goes in he is greeted by a white room with a single chair and a large screen with a picture of a revolving Aethers Gift model on it (http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/029/f/f/starship_wip_2_by_rebelmoon-d389tjv.jpg something like this just slightly fatter on the underside is how I envision it)\n\n \n\nHe speaks to the room but nothing happens. He takes the lone seat and instantly the screen flashes to the Imani Megacorp logo and to then a static picture of a bland business man just an everyday looking John Doe. He is a cheap hologram in terms of function a PR VI. He speaks in a robotic monotone to Clyve and asks about the deal with him. through a series of confusing sub menus CLyve ends up arguing with the VI with the VI talking in spansih, german, cantonese, italian and back to spanish for ten minutes until finally settling on English. When it comes to finalising the deal it offers a deal of 9000 credits per month. Clyve tries to haggle down to 7k per month. The VI asks if Clyve is a native Adilian to which he answers no and the price jumps to 12k per month. Osias strides and the VI recognises the bio-signatures of a native Adilian, Osias enters his Adilian security number (social security number.. of the fuuuuutuuure) and manages to get the price down to 7k as Imani love and reward hard working employees and Adilians.\n\n \n\nWith this the group manage to get aboard the Aethers gift alive and feeling good about their first success in a way. And the prospect of arleady having a job to do.\n\n \n\n**PROLOGUE ENDS FINAL SCENE**\n\n \n\nThe scene cuts to the inside of the bridge of The Aethers Gift, the crew are slowly taking their respective seats the camera is looking into the ship with the front of the brdge behind it. Boris takes his seat in the Pilots seat and starts booting up the Ship, setting his gun next to his seat he wipes a bad of sweat from his brow, Kim takes a seat behind the mound of screens to the right of Boris in the bridges comm suite a micro version of the actual comms room in the ships belly, Osias sits close to Boris left his computer is aimed diagonally to the left of the cameras view he turns his head to Boris and confirms the course is plotted. Clyve stands next to the door to the bridge which is still open.\n\n \n\nOutside the ship the engines heat up from a cold black to a dull orange until flames start to spit out in full throttle behind as the launching platform is upwards through the ice shute to the surface of the planet and to space itself.\n\n \n\nBack in the ship Boris winks to the camera pops the collar of his jacket and punches the launch sequence of the ship which instantly full thrust takes off into space.\n\n \n\nBehind Boris, Clyve falls out the bridge door due to the sudden thrust and the screen cuts to black.\n\n**END OF EPISODE 1**\n\nEdit 1\n\nI'd like to thank everyone who joined me and became part of the group and for everyone who read and applied to my original post there was a lot. and I'd like to thank jp and the gang for bringing me back into the SWN numbers fold that's why I decided to share this.

        "text": "[Welcome, once more, to the merry tales of havoc and mayhem that are my pathfinder campaign](http://redd.it/307b54). Again, I introduce you to [the humble players- Rose the dulluhan ranger, Barrel the halfling rogue, Pratena the cyclops murderchild, and Thoth the shabti magus](http://imgur.com/a/4xfYd).\n\nNow that we're all acquainted with them, let's switch perspective to something comple- no? Okay, fine. Our adventure begins with Rose finally getting word back from the resident linguist, at last discovering just what the hell was written on her hand. It was a love letter. And because the purpose of a dullahan is to obey its Duty (which is written on its hand), Rose had no choice but to obey the only things in the letter that could be construed as orders- a pleading request to return to the writer.\n\nThe rest of the party became very appropriately alarmed when Rose determinedly marched off into the sunset without saying goodbye to anyone. When people tried to stop her from going, she stepped on them. And she didn't even say a single word. The party managed to hobble her enough so that they could keep pace in their horse-drawn cart, and followed her to her eventual destination.\n\nThere's a lot of things you might expect to find at the end of a long, mysterious journey. Generally, you do not expect to find [a twelve-foot-tall drunkard wallowing in his own misery](http://i.imgur.com/OitHIRC.png) and bickering with [an impish version of himself](http://i.imgur.com/ovg2Nz2.png), which has been impaled onto the column of a gazebo. Rose's arrival sparked something akin to hope in the drunkard's eyes, and the party's demands for explanations fell on deaf ears. The drunkard appeared to be having an intimate moment with Rose (who was screaming internally), the little impish creature was sarcastically screaming for help, and the party was just plain screaming.\n\nWhat little information emerged was that the drunk apparently thought Rose was his lost love, and that the little imp was some sort of magical creature that had been captured and forced to recreate scenes from the drunkard's past. Rose was at once incredibly curious as to her previous life, and horrified that she apparently didn't have a choice in shouldering the role again. The drunk saw how she didn't remember, and vowed to show her who she used to be. The imp grumbled, did something, and the whole world went wobbly.\n\nRose- or the dullahan part of Rose- was treated to a trip down memory lane, passively watching as the drunk recounted the events of her old life. The party were strung along for the ride, but things got a bit muddled on the way in- the body that they all ended up occupying was not theirs. According to the drunk, it used to be Rose's, before she died. Accusations, explanations and general exclamations of dismay tumbled out of one mouth, all at once, in a great torrent of screamy word salad. The drunk was convinced that this was the imp being a jackass, and sicced the phantoms of his memory on the party.\n\nThe battle played out like a bastard child of Pathfinder, Time Fcuk and Everyone Is John- each player was present (including Rose), but only one could take the helm at any given time, and in order to switch who was driving, someone had to burn an action. In theory, this should have been a huge disadvantage, but the party pooled their efforts and managed to turn the rather addled body into a screaming whirlwind of kukris, fists, and furious magic, which was also armored up to the eyeballs. The horrifying apparition screamed, casted, shanked and suplexed its way through all the nasty memories of the drunkard, each time managing to plant a little more doubt in his mind. Then Pratena got impatient, ran forward, and kicked him squarely in the groin.\n\nThe reel of memory spun one last time as the drunkard curled up in agony- the party landed square in his worst memory. As it happened, it was the memory of fighting an Oni warlord- specifically, an Ice Yai.\n\nPratena and Barrel both took the offensive immediately, with her doing a full-body tackle that nearly pinned the giant on the spot. Barrel followed up with a couple of nasty sneak attacks, but paid for it when the Oni's turn came around, and he ate the full force of a Polar Ray and the Oni's signature icy missile. Rose stepped to the fore and casted- of all the stupid things- [Marid's Mastery](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/marid-s-mastery). It was inspired. The Oni was immediately crippled. It took to its enormous heels while summoning flunkies and using ranged spells wherever possible, but Rose's massive armor rating and flaming spear advanced on him and brought him to his knees- which, conveniently enough, was inside Barrel's shank radius. He plunged both of his kukris directly into the thing's third eye.\n\nThis done, the team immediately set about bickering as to how the hell they were going to get out of there. This was hampered a bit by the fact that they were STILL all using the same mouth. The four-way conversation bounced around the topics of the memory spell's effective radius, what would happen if they killed the imp, and just how in the hell they were going to get Rose back into her body. Speaking of which, the body was still present, and- Oh yeah. It had been told to be a protective and affectionate person, and so decided to take revenge on the mean thing that had kicked its \"boyfriend\" in the nuts (after providing \"comfort\" in an emotionless monotone). Rose's body charged. Pratena stepped up, dodged the first strike, grabbed its arm and bit down directly onto the hand bearing Rose's Duty with her steel-reinforced teeth.\n\nAnd just like that, everyone was suddenly back in their own form. Rose profusely thanked her cyclops friend (not minding the hideously mangled hand, she could just reforge it) while Thoth was reeling and Barrel was being tormented by the damn imp. After an escalating screaming match, the imp said it would be HAPPY to let them out of cry-me-a-river-ville, just as soon as someone removed the damn spike that was keeping it under the drunk's control. Acting on impulse (and momentarily ignoring the unanimous chorus of \"*DON'T DO IT YOU IDIOT!*\", Barrel pulled the spike out and the illusion vanished. They were back in reality, and the imp was decidedly gone, except for the smug cackling.\n\nBarrel spent the next five minutes furiously trying to undo what he had just done while Rose and Pratena explained to the drunk that no, she was not his dead girlfriend, and to just let things go. it was very heartwarming, except for the part where Pratena's speech synth lapsed into a scottish accent and started swearing. An entirely different flavor of swearing started when Rose offered the drunk a job at their mercenary organization- to put it mildly, Barrel took exception to this. It was eventually agreed that the drunk could join them if there was no funny business- and, at Barrel's insistence, he would have to spend the three-day journey walking instead of riding the party's sweet-ass cart.\n\n[NEXT TIME ON \"A three-car pileup on memory lane\", ALL ABOARD THE LOOT TRAIN AND WRITTEN BY M NIGHT SHAMAMALAMADINGDONG!](http://redd.it/32cbx6)",

        "text": "This was Warhammer Fantasy 2nd Edition, played with two groups and me as the game master. The groups were led by the Wolfen brothers, the 2nd and 3rd sons of a small noble house. The brothers hated each other, and Magnus von Wolfen, the elder brother and a formidable warrior, had sworn to take Johann von Wolfen, a pretty evil mage, down if they ever crossed paths. \n\nThe \"good\" group, led my Magnus, had accidentily awakened the spirit of a powerful necromancer, Isthar the black. The necromancer took the form of a wraith but was trapped within the ruins of an old temple. Magnus and his companions were able to escape the wraiths icy grasp, but were unable to destroy the creature. \n\nA few months later Johann and his companions heard rumours of an evil creature hunting an abandoned temlpe and decided to investigate. Instead of fighting the wraith however, they talked to it. Isthar promised to give them all rich rewards and tutor Johann in the arts of Necromancy if they helped him get several thungs he needed for a ritual intended to resurrect him. They agreed, not knowing that Isthar had talked two other fledgling necromancers into collecting things for him too. \n\nTwo years later the ritual was ready, and Isthar set the date for the next Geheimnisnacht (\"Night of Secrets\", one of only two nights a year in which both moons would be full. These nights are enhancing the power of magic and are used for all kinds of evil deeds while decent folk cover at home and prey). \n\nSadly for Isthar one of his necromancers, Frederik Sattler, had realized that the wraith would have no more need of servants who were alive if he managed to get resurrected. He contacted Magnus von Wolfen and his companions and leaked the information about the ritual to them. They decided to assemble a small army and strike during the ritual, destroying the wraith and all of his servants in one strike. \n\nDue to various schemes the \"good\" group managed to lure a group of orcs to the temple, promising their boss a big fight (orcz lovez tha fightin'). They assembled nearly a hundred soldiers, led by several priests of Sigmar. And as a master-move by the groups mage they contacted the undead inhabitants of a lon-destroyed town. These creatures had been cursed with undeath by Isthar and were eager for revenge. Thus Salah al Din and his undead Arabian warriors promised to show up and bring their cursed blades to the fight on the side of good. \n\nJohann von Wolfen and his companions had prepared everything. Johann himself had become quite a proficient necromancer and had assembled an army of walking dead. Hundreds of zombies and skeletons were buried in the dirt around the temple, awaiting the call to arms. Jägershausen, a mighty warrior and ally of Johann, stood ready to lead the higher level undead (wights and a couple of spirits) in the defense of the temple walls themselves. Ghoule and fliying, undead *things* were controlled by Isthar himself and another necromancer. Thus the stage for the confrontation was set. \n\nUsually this would have been 3 vs 3, with 3 players in each group. But I decided to make this thing BIGGER. I organized a huge table with ruins on it and dozens of miniatures. One new player took the role of the NPC necromancer. One other was playing Salah al Din, another one was the head priest of Sigmar. One final new player was the orc boss. \n\nThe whole battle took most of a day to finish. We played from noon until nearly the next morning. But it was worth it, and everyone had heaps of fun. \n\nThe warriors of good (the priests, soliders, PCs and the Arabian undead) closed in on the temple from all sides. They first thought things went too smoothly, but then the dead started rising from the mud. There was an army awaiting them. The unlikely allies did not hesitate though, and went in with everything they had. \n\nIn the middle of all of that, the titanic forces of magic unleashed by the ritual started to draw daemons from the warp, horrible creatures that brought unnatural mist and minor earthquakes with them. The daemons were attacking whoever proved to be near them and added a factor of even mroe upleasant surprise to the battle (I had a random table prepared on which I rolled every couple of rounds to see what effects the huge concentration of dark magic would have on the area).\n\nThe Sigmar priests fell won by one, but they took many undead with them. The soldiers were advancing more slowly, but they were being surrounded my more and more minor undead. Salah al Din and his wights had fought their way through to the temple walls and crossed swords with their kindred undead there. The good player characters were heavily damaged by the NPC necromancer (very cleverly played by one of the \"new\" players) but finally managed to take him down with a shadow-magic spell and a holy blade, thus making a flank of Isthar's servants collapse. They ran for the temple...\n\nJohann von Wolfen had assumed his own fortified position and killed many attackers. He was too cautios, however, to face his brother and the Sigmar priests, even though he was mostly fresh and they were fairly heavily wounded. He was still hesitating when loud horns started blaring over the battlefield. The orcs had arrived! \n\nEveryone held their breath. Greenskins were notoriously unpredictable. Which side would they attack? \n\nAt first it seemed the orcs were happy to fight both sides, crushing both living and dead under their huge choppa blades. Then the shadow mage from the good group had a nice idea. Mobilizing most of his remaining power he cast a huge illusion in the shape of a green hand, the hand of Gork (one of the orc gods), pointing towards the position of Johann von Wolfen. The young necromancer and his retinue had to helplessly watch the orc leader and his biggest, meanest grunts race towards them, eager for a good fight. And a good fight they got...\n\nIn the meantime Salah al Din, one remaining priest of Sigmar, Magnus von Wolfen and his one remaining companion (the shadow mage had suddently been felled by one of his own men, but that is a different story), Rudolf (a really powerful warrior) had fought their way into the catacombs under the temple. There they faced the spirit of Isthar himself and his remaining bodyguard. Even though the forces of good nearly crumbled when the necromancer took control of a few of Salah al Din's followers and turned their black blades against their former allies (killing the priest of Sigmar) the cursed lord himself fought his way trough. Isthar and Salah al Din matcher their wills, the one demanding obedience with all his power, the other refusing, fueled with all his hatred. Salah al Din prevailed. His blade wounded the wraith, and that wound broke the spell. Isthar was hacked apart by magical weapons, destroyed for ever. After that the \"good\" group decided to get out of there...\n\nIn the meantime Johann von Wolfen and his retinue, both undead and alive, had lost to the orcs. Jägershausen escaped barely, but Johann perished (without actually ever directly fighting against his brother, who was at one time only a dozen meters away from him) under the giant axe of the orc leader. \n\nSaid orc leader attacked Salah al Din shortly after and was cut down, thus leaving the cursed lord with control over the battlefield. Salah al Din looked up to the rising sun, raised his black sword one last time and finally felt the chains of Isthar's evil magic fall away from his body. Having found his revenge after three hundred years he crumbled to the ground for eternal rest...",

        "text": "Explanation: I recently bought a Wii U, and this was one of the first games I bought for it... I went in blind on Hardcore mode (No respawns.) A choice I don't regret... I haven't finished the game, and request that you guys don't spoil the ending/plot twists for me before I do. \n\n[SPOILER WARNING]\n\nI assume that Micheal was a pretty ordinary guy prior to whatever caused the zombie apocalypse, he was an assistant manager. I'm not sure what he assisted to manage. But he could swing a Cricket Bat to save his life...  seeing as how he did it 100+ times.\n\nAfter escaping a large horde of the undead by fleeing into Shadwell train station, he met his first friend, the Prepper. Mister the Prepper helped him get acclimatized to life in undead London by way of radio. Not long after, he met his second friend; the Cricket bat.\n\nNow let's jump to the first time he was happy he wore brown trousers.\nHe was happily sneaking around Brick Lane Markets, minding his own business, about to enter a supermarket. Who knew that a block where the streetlights were out would still have power to the alarm system? Not Micheal, not the Prepper, well this experience would teach the both of them. Micheal froze dead still^1 as sirens blared out into the cold streets of nighttime London. He quickly realized how stupid standing still was and panicked, turning tail and fleeing as fast he could sprint. Shame he was surrounded, shame he collided with the reincarnation of a police officer and it's damn shame for the undead that Micheal must have been a professional cricket player in his off time.\n\nDodging snarling Bobbys and what, from a distance could have been mistaken for a staggering drunk woman, Micheal had somehow sealed himself inside the grocery store, and by somehow I mean he was goddamn lucky that he knocked over the living impaired cop-pa that had broken down the alarm-rigged door and proceeded to slam and lock a heavyset door on the inside of the supermarket in the deformed faces of London's finest corpses, muttering a thankful \"f@#k the P*o*lice\" he ventured into the supermarket, and thus learned his first lesson about corpse disposal 'always, Always! take off their heads. Because the \"dead\" dead people started not being so \"dead-dead\".\n\nNow, he did escape that supermarket, he made it all the way back to the safehouse, and after a little nap was absolutely not ready for; Brown Trousers 2; Electric-brown-a-loo.\nNow, the average person probably buys bread, milk, and whatever else they need, Micheal however, grabbed Molotovs, too bad whilst a good designated hitter, he was, a terrible pitcher. Fighting seven coffee-deprived commuters in a cramped subway tunnel smelling intensely of smoke and blood was clearly not a strong suit of Mr Cambridge, and the many missed molotovs made things much hotter.\nBut being backed into a corner without any ammo and lungs full of smoke is definitely not the best place to be, now after battering down a few of the monsters assaulting him, he had an idea, one so bad it *almost* caused his death, you see, he had a landmine, he found it in a room of the safehouse, now, he didn't know the range, intensity or really anything about them, but it must of seemed a better option then death so...\n\nHe pushed the Remaining zombies out of the small room, closed the door and threw down a landmine, Micheal hid himself in the corner, and when the zeds walked through...\n\nWell. He didn't die, but I think that the Anti-climactic death of Michael Cambridge, Assistant Manager, part time Cricketer can wait until tomorrow.\n\n...Oh yeah, BOOM! he survived... barely, and proceeded to limp back behind the protective doors the Prepper had prepped and sleep of his near death experience.\n\n^1 I may have dropped the gamepad.",

Once in there our paladin decided to pray to his god for protection. To make fun of him, our wizard then decided to pray to Tymora, the goddess of luck. I rolled a dice just to see if i should make anything happen and rolled a 1. What then followed was the sound of 12 zombies banging on the door. This is a 1800 xp encounter and is more xp than a \"Deadly\" encounter. They fled through the back door and used rope trick to climb into an inter dimensional portal 15 ft in the sky, pulling the rope in behind them. The zombies broke down the door and ended up hording below the portal. The party was essentially trapped in this portal for an hour until they where deposited back on the ground. The wizard had the wonderful idea of leaning out of the portal and casting fire bolt repeatedly for an hour to kill all of them on his own.",

        "text": "My name is Vashiel Weston, but my friends call me [Captain](http://i.imgur.com/Jn9KDvA.jpg). This is the story of my quest to become the King of all Free Sailors, the Pirate King, and claim the legendary hoard of Draksis.\n\nDraksis was a pirate, Draksis was also a Dragon. Legends say his lust for gold and power alienated him from even his own kind. He formed an army and ruled as a Pirate Admiral, amassing wealth, power and magic as his pirates did his bidding under the command of his Dragonborn generals… his reign was unchallenged, his rule over the sea absolute and his hoard was unfathomable. Then Dragons ceased to be… It’s a mystery that has the scholars of Heca purplexed, the Dragons just vanished. Dragons were always reclusive but suddenly they were just gone, and whilst eggs were still around they would not hatch. Dragonborn, few there were, became wandering vagabonds devoid of purpose or sought new devotion elsewhere. Of course all assumed that Draksis was also gone if his kin had all vanished and that meant his hoard was ripe for the taking, and whomever would claim the Hoard of the Dragon Pirate would surely wield influence and power worthy of the title Pirate King.\n\nCryptic clues and rumours became twisted and warped by time, muddled and confused by countless retellings and lack of consistency. I have spent my childhood enamoured by the idea that any one man could possess such freedom. To put himself against the trials of the open sea and should he be worthy he would discover the largest hoard ever gathered and lay claim to it. To be revered and remembered as the Pirate King. To be able to be truly free, to not be left wanting or needing for anything and to be able to go anywhere, do anything; that is the true prize granted by the hoard though many are blinded by simple goldlust.\n\nI have discovered one truth, there are three chests. I do not know what is in these chests, or how to open them, or where they are, or how they lead to the hoard; but there are three chests and they are the key to Draksis’s hoard.\n\nWho am I to pronounce myself the next Pirate King? Well, I was a young boy from [Shine](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/2hta54/just_finished_my_worlds_first_city_shine_the/), an affluent port city which is known around the Dreamsea as the Coastal Jewel. I was raised by my Aunt and Uncle who operate a Tavern on the docks known as the Kraken’s head. My uncle Brandt is a retired Whaler who spends his retirement laughing, brewing ales and smoking a pipe. He is covered in a map of scars from his time at sea. His Wife, my aunt, Siglinde runs the Tavern and she’s a massive Valkyrie of a woman, aging far more gracefully than my Uncle, with just a few grey specs in her blonde hair.\n\nBeing raised in a Tavern was an experience, at a young age I learned to entertain, I would watch Bards practise during the quiet hours, as they were staying for free as long as they entertained. I would ask questions and some were happy to tutor me. I learned the Violin first, and one day one of the retiring bards entrusted me with his Violin that had be crafted by masters, he told me I had a true Talent for the Violin and asked that I do the instrument justice. It was with that Violin I uncovered my magical talents, which I channel through song.\n\nMy Aunt and Uncle raised me as my Mother, Ekaterina Weston, died during my birth. I have never forgiven myself for killing her, and neither has my father Ceowulf Weston. Ceowulf refuses to tell me anything about her and is constantly away from Shine, working. He was working when I was born and he wasn’t there, my uncle says that missing my birth and my mother’s death caused him to work even harder and now he returns to Shine maybe once a year. He’s a Navy Officer, a respected captain and we’re not on good terms.\n\nI got into a fair amount of trouble as a teenager, me and my best friend Zook, a Gnome apprenticed to the local artificer, played many a prank on the \"Shiners\" who are the local thieves guild. When I was sixteen Zook joined the Navy and the day he sailed off for basic training I made a choice. I was going to be a Free Sailor, I would apprentice on a ship as my uncle had taught me how to sail, and I would never answer to another again. I would take my Freedom.\n\nI stepped aboard a merchant ship and never looked back. A few months later, by chance, I noted one of the ships docked was the White Hydra, a ship belonging to Ballast Boot Ethel, a Pirate Captain on the Council of Thirteen. Ethel got her name from the metal boot she wears, he lost her lower left leg years ago and uses her heavy metal boot as a weapon occasionally. I talked and sang my way onto the ship, and I sailed with the White Hydra pirates for a few years. The White Hydra mainly targeted smugglers and criminals, using black market information and targets to get prime hauls. We spent a time in Vendrikar, the region of the Orcish nobles where I witnessed slavery that wracked me to my core. We did raid some ships that used slave labour to row and I broke their shackles whilst my crew took the cargo; I feel no remorse for what happened when we left that ship, whatever fate befell the crew once I had made the slaves their equals.\n\nRecently I received a message from Brandt, urging me to return to Shine as he had news for me that would be best discussed in person. I explained my situation to the White Hydras and with some reluctance left the ship in a port town where I could find passage to Shine.  \n  \nI have found passage on a merchant ship which intends to deliver some trade goods to Shine. It is a large ship and there are several other passengers;  \n**Thal’galan**, an older… guessing mid-thirties, lightly armoured Half Elf armed with sword and shield. He carries himself like military but doesn’t seem like a hard-ass, currently a bounty hunter.  \n**Luna**, Thal'galan's travelling companion, she’s an Elf, looks like some sort of tracker, which matches their story of being bounty hunters. She has a bow and doesn’t speak.  \n**Castiel**, or “Cass” as he likes to be called. A half elf, carrying a Lute. An entertainer and performer.  \n**Kaiden**, a Halfling, apparently he’s a big deal back where he’s from, a regular hero among his people. Set out to adventure, he reminds me of a Shiner, just like those thieves in the way he holds himself.  \n**Kurtious Nod**, or “Kurt”, a Gnome, has kept himself to himself. I don’t know much about him at all.  \n**Aggarak**, A burly half orc in armour, He’s got a great big hammer and a shield. I also recognised that holy symbol he carries, a follower of Zeus. He is dressed well and apparently has some sort of noble background to his name… one of the Vendrikar families.  \n  \n[Part 2 - Mutiny!](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3241tw/dd_5e_the_singing_pirate_mutiny/)",

        "text": "This is the story of a group consisting of:\n\nA murderous DM\n\nA insane tiefling bard\n\nA snooty as all hell high (so high up his own arse) Elf Wizard\n\nThree dragonborns, one black, one gold, and one red\n\nBlack was a very, very suspicious dragonborn sorcerer (of the wild type)\n\nMr. Goldilocks was a big paladin super hero man guy\n\nRed was the new guy, cleric\n\nA dwarf cleric, who didn't do much this session\n\nAnd me, the absolutely retarded Half-Orc fighter. Cliche. Didn't do anything at all.\n\nOur massive group at this time was doing a campaign where on a caravan ride we spotted a big burning town under siege from some sort of Dragon. Of course, our little goody two shoes team decided to go down there, and as we did we found the Dragon Cult, cultists who wanted to make a mass grave and turn a dragon into a Lich to rule the world.\n\nEven walking into this place was a bad idea, we had multiple fights and after the evil tiefling murdering a defenseless bandit, had a party internal conflict. Luckily it didn't get SO far into a brawl, or we were toast.\n\nWe had found a woman under siege from nine kobolds, so we slaughtered the lot and saved the woman and brought the woman to a keep that was constantly under siege by the cultists and drakes and various other things. The Governor told us heroes to go and defend the Sally Port, one of the various entrances to the keep, and it's outer door had been smashed open.\n\nWhat happened was a bunch of kobolds, a knight, cultists, a drake that bit me, almost me after the noobie tried to swing a mace, and an acolyte son of a gun dying. We rebuilt sally port using the Mend cantrip, and went to go talk to Governor Man Person Importanto.\n\nHe said we needed to go rescue people, so we went down a secret passageway and fought a bunch of rats, then almost at the end found a grate above us. We smashed the lock open, and looked up. We found the cultists EVERYWHERE. We hid back down, as one of us was almost already dead and we had no other option, we went back.\n\nApparently that wasn't a good idea.\n\nAfter we had intimidated our way back in and pulled levers to make the tunnel collapse, we tried to have a little short rest, when a massive, adult, blue dragon started attacking us.\n\nOur plan was to get through the sally port as they broke open the main gate to escape the keep, and it'd have worked if it weren't for the insane tiefling bard who went up to heroically distract the dragon with a song, as blue dragons are susceptible to that kind of stuff. The dragon was not impressed.\n\nThe dragon had a conversation with the bard, in which we started chanting outside how the dragon was amazing to further the bard's point of managing to reach it's name to others. We even took the Governor's armor off (after he had almost become ash- barely alive but somehow alive) and put it on a corpse and gave it to the dragon, the dragon wanted one more from us.\n\nThe dragon wanted us to open the gate so the cult can run in and murder everyone. Well, we weren't about to let that happen, but the tiefling was! She tried to go there, but the paladin shot a blunt arrow at her and drove her to him, then tried to reason with her. It didn't work so he tried to punch the tiefling in the face. Charm paladin, charm goes off, bard has successfully charmed paladin into not punching her in face.\n\nSo, tiefling goes off to open the gate with the red dragonborn who would make a shrine to the dragon to buy time for the Black dragonborn, who was currently discussing with the Governor and the rest of the siege guards to fire ballistas at the dragon as a last chance defense. Tiefling knows she can't pick up the bar, so she's fine, but to make sure that the dragon knows she's trying, she tries anyway.\n\nROLLS A 20\n\nHuge pound bar is magically lifted up by the 8 strength bard tiefling, and basically everything is going to shit. However, the Black Dragonborn is acting now, and he's about to fire a shot at the big baddie dragon.\n\nNow, keep in mind that the dragon has an AC of 19-\n\nROLLS A 20\n\n6d10 damage, gets 21 (facepalm) party screwed at this point, however all the other siege guys are about to fire their ballistas also, but keep in mind that the AC is still 19, and the dragon is about to fire lightning at the dragonborn firing and the governor pushing the ballista, and they're about to be zap-\n\nTwo miss, one rolls a 20. 6d10 points of damage, gets 27, attack interrupted, the dragon literally says \"fuck this I'm out\" and flies off, leaving the cult siege to it's own devices.\n\nEveryone surviving in the keep is patting us on the back and we're at the table losing our shit.\n\nBest part?\n\nWe're all level 2.\n\n(I'd like to state this is my first reddit post and here on Gametales, so if you have any advice, advice give away!)",

        "text": "So, let me preface this by saying I'm still very new to D&amp;D. I started what was for most of us our first campaign of D&amp;D a month or two ago. Our DM however is pretty experienced to my knowledge, though. \n\nAt any rate, last week, our DM was out of town, so instead of just skipping that week, I decided to try my hand at it. I searched around online a bit for a good one off, and settled on the Mines of Madness.\nHad a total of three players, and as soon as they finished creating their high elf cleric, half-orc fighter, and dragonborn fighter, we were off!\n\n**Mines of Madness spoilers ahead!**\n\nFor those of you who have played Mines of Madness, you may remember that there's a outhouse placed about 30 feet outside of the mine entrance with a nice sign that says, \"KEEP OUT.\" \nHowever, we're talking about adventurers here, so that sign may as well have been a warm and friendly invite to go inside. ...Which is exactly what our Half-orc fighter did. Completely ignored all warnings, walked right in and sat down to take a poop. \n\nOnce again, for those of you who have played Mines of Madness, you probably know what happens next. For those of you who don't, that's exactly when a Purple Worm errupts from the ground and swallows the outhouse, and whoever is inside. Everyone rolls for initiative, and as soon as it's the worms turn again it retreats back down it's whole. What I probably should have done is just killed off the half-orc then and there. Only to rename the character and have him just so happen to walk up as the worm retreats as a completely different person.\n\nInstead, I figured if he got swallowed whole, he probably isn't dead, and let him fight to get out. Took some acid and bludgeoning damage from being digested, but over all was in decent health. He was constrained and only had heavy weapons on him, so cutting himself out didn't seem to be in the cards. The only obvious solution was to climb back into the mouth, and try to break it open. As soon as he made it back into the worms mouth, he was promptly bit and almost killed. When the worm went to swallow him, he managed to grab onto a small tooth and hold on for dear life.\n\nAll the while, our dragonborn fighter and high elf cleric decided the best course of action was to follow him down and try and fight off the worm. So they slide their way down the spiral hole left by this purple worm, and immediately jump into action. They get some good hits in but so does the worm. A sting here, some poison damage there, and our dragonborn isn't looking so hot.\n\nBack inside the worm's mouth, the half orc swings around to try and break some teeth, maybe convince it to open it's mouth enough from him to escape. He succeeds in breaking some teeth, but not opening it's mouth. So while the battle rages on outside, he tries to pry it open.\nI let him roll a strength check, and he rolled a 19. I was sure this was it, our half orc would escape, get some nice heals, and this would be a short dungeon. Instead, the worm got a nat 20, adding up to 28. As the half-orc began to open the worms mouth it promptly clamped shut, killing him in the process.\n\nWith a now free mouth, the worm made relatively quick work of the remaining two adventurers and ate them as well. Why our cleric used no healing spells is beyond be, but oh well. I was pretty okay with it, as I wanted them to go through the main entrance anyways.\n\nHowever it is worth noting that they did almost kill the worm.",

        "text": "The Band of Somewhat Respectable Heroes    \n\tThe hull of the ship slowly bounced along the waves as it continued its journey to Ezamir. Hidden behind some of the ship’s cargo, in the darkness of the cargo hold, sat six men; waiting in silence for the end of their two week long journey across the Northern Sea. The thick scent of body odor hung heavy, a constant reminder of the hundreds of passengers, ailed with some unidentified sickness that had quickly infected many of the ship’s voyagers. The six that were hidden were some of the lucky, unlikely to become one of the dozens who had been thrown overboard. In under the deck days passed like weeks and most sense of time had been lost. Without any view to the outside not even sundial wrist bands could give one a sense of how long they had been traveling.    \n\tThe cargo hold had remained silent, broken only by the coughs of the sick and the weeping of the mournful; constant reminders of a fate that could end short the goals of anyone: young or old, strong or weak. For one the silence had driven him to his breaking point; and, despite the danger he could be in upon being discovered, the brave Bladeling rose to his feet and spoke. “I am Kane. I have left my hometown to escape the horrors left behind by the Spellplauge. I have set out to forge a new life; for, as the Spellplauge began its infection, many of my family members became Plaugechanged and I took it upon myself to put them out of their misery. I have not been so fortunate. Left to live with the horrors of what I have done and the Spellscars to give me constant reminders.”\n\nAs the Bladeling returned to his seat, the silence now broken, a Halfling rises and introduces himself as Halzier. “I too left for Ezamir for a new start, a place where my wife and daughter could live happily, away from the tyranny of King Zogaz. But the plague infected my daughter and she had to be thrown overboard. The loss was too much for my wife and the grief weakened her causing her to become ill.” As tears began to stain the Halfling’s face he tried to move on and asked the only human in the group why he had set out for Ezamir.\n\nIn reply to Halzier’s inquiry the human introduced himself as Jonn Fiedlerson and began to tell his tale. “I have scoured the known world searching for a destiny that was bestowed upon me at birth. For at the time of my birth a star shot across the sky, brighter than the moon and closer to the ground than any I have heard of. When I was born the heavens came to the over-world and it has been my journey to seek out the reason I have been chosen. Each night I have vivid dreams of a world much like ours, but different. Where crossbows can shoot their arrows at tremendous speeds and night can become day at with the mere push of a button. I now return to visit my family in Ezamir, no progress made in finding the star or what these dreams may mean.” \n\nThe man continued on with wild stories of adventures in far off lands but was rudely interrupted by a Genasi who cut in rather abruptly. “My name is Vanri and I much like you,” he started; nodding at Jonn “Have set out to uncover a mysterious secret. For when I was younger I partook in time travel research within my clan of wizards. However as we felt our search for a way to modify the progression of time was drawing to and end an experiment went horribly wrong. I cannot recall what spells we had conjured that day but I awoke alone, at the mouth of a river I knew should have been surrounded by houses. But I soon discovered that, along with my village, all recorded history of my home had never existed. Now I travel with no purpose but to find answers to the tragedy that I alone have bared for nearly fifteen years.” \n\nAs Vanri finished his tale a Githzerai rose and began telling his new-found comrades his story. “I am Zane, worshipper of Bahumut. I have decided to travel to Ezamir to recruit allies in quest to avenge the death of my best friend. King Zogaz had him assassinated and for that I must get justice. I spend each day knowing the man who sentenced my best friend to death still lives without remorse. So I have set out to gather riches and fame to become the most powerful warlord to have ever existed and get justice for my friend.”\n\nGithzerai returned to his seat and the group fell quiet; looking to the Deva. There was no response, the Deva observed in silence but contributed nothing to the conversation. However, his silence was cut short as tentacle bashed through the hull of the ship, causing its passengers to be thrown towards one side and grasping the Halfling tightly within its suction cups. The others could only watch in horror as Halzier was quickly drawn out into the frigid waters of the north and his life quickly became naught more than a memory. The hull of the ship began to fill with water and it became plainly visible to those who remained that nearly half the ship had also been torn off, leaving hundreds to spend their final moments struggling to find a breath of air as the ship dragged them down to the ocean’s floor; the final resting place of the forgotten.\n\nThe Deva quickly sent out a prayer and rose to his feet. He could recall noticing that one of the cargo crates tended to move more than the others and lifted the canvas covering what he discovered to be a cage. Upon a quick examination the Deva discovered an extremely odd creature whose nightmarish figure was matched by its elegant beauty. The creature was not like anything he had ever seen before, with the form of a bear but the coat of an owl. The Deva could see the fear in the creature’s eyes and scattered trail mix in the water lapping at their feet.\n\nAs the Deva had begun what appeared to be a rescue of an Owlbear the others followed panicked passengers onto the deck. Once the deck came into view it soon became obvious that this tentacle had not belonged to just an everyday squid, but a giant Kraken. The adventurers stood in horror as they watched people being thrown overboard and drowned. Zane quickly darted behind the captain’s quarters to hide himself from the view of the terrible creature and devise a plan of action. Once Vanri had climbed up the stairs onto the deck he immediately conjured an illusionary chest of untold riches to draw the panicked sailors and peasants away from the giant beast. The lucky few that were drawn towards the treasure were immediately given orders by Kane to throw the broken mast onto the Kraken, which was blown off as rubbish coming from a mere peasant. The fight had begun to feel helpless as the Kraken continued to send dozens to their deaths and the mighty adventurers had not even begun to fight back.\n\nMeanwhile, the Deva smashed the lock that had been holding the Owlbear within its cage and, with a look that seemed to reveal a mutual understanding, the Owlbear swiftly followed the Deva up the stairs and onto the deck. The Owlbear, overwhelmed by the sights and sounds of its new-found freedom attempted to flee towards the ocean that had become level to the half of the ship that was going under. The Deva watched with a heavy heart as his newest companion ran into the clutches of the monster lurking in the dark water surrounding the ship. At that moment the Deva found a purpose, a reason to fight; to save the life of an innocent creature. With a shout of anger the Deva was able to give hope to those who had given up, driving them to clamber back onto the deck after jumping overboard like a bunch of cowards. With the right motivation the battle to save the bear had begun. With close combat nearly impossible to initiate while the Kraken remained within the frigid waters of the North Ocean, Jonn released a blitz of mean-spirited comments towards the Kraken enraging it into dragging itself onto the deck. As the adventurers begun to attack they quickly realized that with each hit the grasps of the suction-covered tentacles would tighten further and it became clear that the Owlbear was not going to survive much longer. Vanri saw his opening he let loose a burst of nearly uncontrollable magic dazing the Kraken and causing it to release its grasps upon the adventurers. \n\nKane hit the deck hard and heard crying coming from the hull of the ship. He quickly raced down the stairs towards the source of the sound and, to his disbelief, found a baby Orc wrapped in a brown sheet which had been drenched by the water that was rushing into the hull.\nA cry of “You shall not escape my torment Kraken!” filled the air as Zane plunged his sword deep into the flesh of the Kraken causing a rush of blood to begin pouring onto the deck. The Kraken, weakened and bleeding drowned its final victim and let out a shriek of pain as the Owlbear, enraged by the attacks of the Kraken, let loose two powerful clawing attacks and killed the horrific beast.\n\nThe adventurers looked around and a feeling of sorrow rushed over them. They were the only ones who remained. Besides the crashing of the waves, silence. The adventurers slowly began to regroup and figure out a plan of action. Vanri searched the Captain’s quarters of a map that could give them and idea of where they had become stranded, but besides an edition of “The Lust Half-Orc Maid” nothing of use could be found. Kane, identified the Orc as a male and asked Vanri to magically un-soil the baby’s pants. The Deva, who had fought valiantly to save the Owlbear, attempted to enhance the kinship he had created with the Owlbear, however instead the owlbear jumped into the ocean and swam away. Zane saw mountains and the party took pieces of wood and swam to the nearest land that was visible.\n\n",

        "text": "The Harlequin and The Bear Man. Story based on 5e session with a friend\n\nThe Harlequin sat at a table in the tavern. It smelled of blood and sweat and you could almost taste the stale liquor in the air. Most of the people were crowded around a large fighting ring in the center. The Harlequin was waiting till evening when some of the more wealthy patrons of the bar would be around, as he'd gambled his money away and needed more. He'd resolved to \"dance for his dinner\" as he had heard some low life bard tell him through a large mug of ale. \n\nAs he sat and waited a man he recognised strode into the bar. Well when I say man I mean it in the broadest definition of the word. While he was technically a man he was the size of a bear and just as strong. The Harlequin raised his hand and waved to him calling his over. As he sat he shook the table and the Harlequin said \"Good to see you again Braud. What brings you to this neck of the woods?\" \nTo which Braud replied \"Well I'm quite glad I found you here, I have a proposition for you\"\n\"Do tell\" The Harlequin replied.\n\"I suggest, considering your financial state, a way for us both to make a bit of cash\" Braud said waving for the barman to bring him a drink\n\"Go on.\"\n\"As I'm sure you are aware, this fine establishment has a fighting ring for all sorts to earn some money. Only down side is all you get is three silver pieces for fighting. I suggest we rig a fight. One of us takes a few hits and goes down, we both get our silver. But one of our mates on the side place a large bet on one of us to win. Then we split the cash 50/50. Whatcha think?\"\n\"That sounds like a fine deal to me friend, but who's our third man? I'm pretty new here and the only person I know is you. The guy I work with is no where to be found either.\"\n\"Mmm, good point...\" Braud said craning his neck searching the bar. \"Ah I've found our man\" He said nodding his head toward the other side of the tavern. An old man was sitting in a wheel chair beside a man on par with Braud in height and size. Braud rose from the table and walked to the old man. They exchanged a bit of conversation and Braud returned\n\"We're good to go if you are?\"\n\"Who's taking the fall?\"\n\"I will\" Braud replied \"You'll have worse odds so we'll have a bigger payout\"\n\"Let's do it\"\n\n\nThe next thing he knew the Harlequin was inside the fighting arena up against a man who would make a bear jealous. But he knew the plan, he threw out punches and kicks here and there, occasionally taking a couple of hits, but it was all part of the act. He fired out a kick that Braud would have barely felt yet it threw the bear-man off his feet. The Harlequin flipped backwards and waited till his opponent was back on his feet then flew at him for the final strike. The Harlequin shot a jab into the big man's chin then a roundhouse kick across his face. Except he missed. At the last second Braud had dodged both attacks with agility that shouldn't have been possible for a man of his size. The last thing the Harlequin saw before blacking out was Braud's fists coming down on his head. \n\n\nWhen he regained consciousness he became aware of the taste of blood in his mouth and pain on his cheeks. Braud was standing over him, a wicked smile on his face. The Harlequin slowly got to his feet backing away from Braud to the edge of the arena. \nThe Harlequin breathed \"The fight is yours friend, I'm done\"\nTo which the crowd replied with chuckles. The Harlequin's heart leapt into his throat as he realised what he'd gotten himself into.\n\n\"This fight's to the death mate\" cried a voice from the crowd\nAs the Harlequin gathered himself and his thoughts Braud said through his wicked grin, \"Sorry friend, it's nothing personal, really.\"\n\nThe Harlequin pulled himself off the ground, drew two of his daggers from their sheaths, and spat blood onto the ground. \"If it's to the death you're going to have to work for it\"\n\nBraud's smile somehow grew wider and he darted forward, faster than the Harlequin was expecting. He barely had enough time to duck under the blow before it was sailing through the space where his face used to be. After ducking the blow he moved closer and buried one of his daggers into Braud's stomach and the other into his back. Braud cried in pain and stumbled backwards to the center of the arena. The Harlequin fell back and drew his other two daggers preparing himself for the next attack. He was caught somewhat off guard however when the stitching along Braud's back began to tear apart. As the stitching tore, out from inside Braud's lifeless body came a man wearing black robes and a lovingly crafted suit made of what looked like human bones. \nAs this robed figure emerged from Braud's skin it looked straight and the Harlequin and said \"I told you, clown. It's nothing personal. You just forgot to pay the wrong people\"\n\nThe Harlequin realised that it was probably high time to cut his losses on the fight, and he promptly decided it was high time to leave. He threw his knives at the robed man and sprinted in the other direction, throwing down a pile of caltrops as he went. The bone man laughed and began the chase.\n\nThe Harlequin ran, he ran faster than he had ever run before, leaving the bar far behind him. He looked back but his pursuer was no where to be seen. He quickly took a turn and climbed up the side of a building, catching his breath behind a chimney. Then he heard footsteps, he looked up and saw the bone man running along a nearby rooftop, heading straight for him. The Harlequin started running again, they lept from roof to roof, each trying to gain ground on the other. After a few minutes the bone man was beginning to fall behind. \"This is my chance\" the Harlequin though to himself. As he dropped from the rooftop he tore off his colourful jester's clothes,  pulled some clothes from a nearby line and threw them on while running towards the crowded streets. He quickly merged with the crowds and managed to catch his breath. He risked a sideways glance at the rooftop he'd come from and saw the bone man standing there. He looked down at the ground averting his gaze. When he looked back up, the bone man was gone.\n\nThe Harlequin believed it high time he left this city. So he began his work.\n\n\n\nThis is based on a 5e session I did with a friend. Let me know if you want to hear it from a RP perspective rather than as a story.\n\nPart one of a few (not sure at this point) will write more if people want it\n",

        "text": "TL;DR- my pack of badasses got said asses of badness handed to them by an inanimate object despite months of death defying bravery and cunning. Walls are scary, apparently.\n\nI've been DM of a homebrew campaign that I'm honestly quite proud of, riddled with OC and based off of 3.5 structure. I've posted exploits of this party before, but yesterday's session is definitely worthy of note.\n\nFor reference, the party consists of three players, my best buds. One is playing Captain Nathaniel Flint, a blend of the player's personality and Jack Sparrow with a pinch of Barbosa, infamous for wielding his trusty blunderbuss to devastating effect (and my chagrin for letting him have it). Another embodies Chatya, the sassy and quite lovely privateer on a personal mission to hunt down and kill her traitorous brother, and an expert marksman who proudly owns but has never used the first prototype sniper rifle for the flintlock age. And finally there is Darek, a self proclaimed \"Drunken Monk\" who has an obsession with collecting knives, and follows Flint with an unexplained blind devotion.\n\nThis trio has done it all. They've busted out of prison and overthrown a tyrant and his goons in his own fortress. They've navigated the largest ship on the seas out of landlock during a magical hurricane that by rights should have turned it to scrap and killed them all. They've singled out a serial killer from amongst the pack of refugees on their decks as he picked people off one by one. They snuck in to the most impressive fortress on the continent, fought their way to the queen of the Eastern Empire, and smuggled her out of a coup in the midst of chaos as an entire city roid-raged from the overdose they received from a corrupt religious leader and would-be usurper, whose guilt they would later miraculously prove despite the widespread belief that he was their savior from a terrible curse. They've outmaneuvered a flotilla of better manned and better armed craft, avoiding cannon and mortar fire after sneaking aboard and assassinating a commodore and two captains with ease. They ventured into a frozen wasteland, survived the predators within, and tracked down a pocket of dwarves that had been in hiding for centuries working to awaken an elder god. \n\nBut what they couldn't survive was a rock wall.\n\nThe party is piloting their enchanted vessel over the treeline of an island surrounded by magical wards in search of the sole surviving wizard on the planet. They are quickly catching on that this is no ordinary jungle, as they've already been attacked by ninja unicorns, and a thoroughly confused lich still trying to figure out what manner of sorcery was being used against him as the entire pirate crew riddled him with holes a la volleys of musket fire. Poor Darek, in the middle of a very determined bout of stabbing the dead thing floating above the ship, found himself prey to less than accurate fire, which felt anything but friendly. The lich flees but can't escape the final well-placed shots of Chatya and her trusty pistols, and Darek sets to work pulling bullets out of his flesh. \n\nNo sooner does he finish than calamity hits, as all aboard fail to spot the shimmering aura of an anti-magic field that sends the ship plummeting back to earth. They brace themselves as best they can as tons of wood, canvas, metal, and provisions crashes through branches and vines to come to a deafening halt. Their hull in ruins and their crew not much better off, Flint stays behind to supervise efforts to cut down some trees and haul the ship out of the field on rollers as Chatya and Darek scout ahead for a route to the plume of smoke they had spotted before the crash.\n\nDirectly ahead of them lies a depression, about two miles in diameter at its longest, it drops an undetermined depth in a sheer cliff face, filled with trees. To the left are foothills to a solitary mountain peak, they appear to be an easy path but very exposed, and to the right lay a series of rivers, nine of them, the middle three very broad and presumably fast and strong. They choose the pit.\n\nConveniently, a massive tree toppled against the cliff face near them, and provides an easy descent to the ground 300ft below. Once down, they went full \"Apocalypse Now\", trudging warily through the humid bog, eyeing the trees above them and the ferns and brush around them with borderline paranoia, when a flash of blue shoots through the foliage to their right.\n\nThey confer in whispers and Darek slinks into the shadows to circle around and Chatya carries on, her rifle clanking against tree trunks, jostling her pack carelessly as she strives to seat it more comfortably on her back and sighing in a monotone about how scary it is to be just one girl all alone in this strange place. Before long, Darek watches as a lizard the size of a large cat, its skine a bold blue, skitters out onto a leaf, gripping it desperately as it bows under his weight until the top of his head is resting on the soil. The strange creature reflects on his new perspective for all of three seconds before releasing the leaf in a flourish, it snaps upright as he rolls over in a lightning quick movement and disappears after the woman's voice just as blindingly quick. Chatya tries her best to soothe the skittish thing, thinking it may be the wizard's familiar or at least a pet, and while Darek continues to watch from his spot in the brush, a copy of the first lizard scurries onto his back, peeking over his shoulder intent on its cousin. Darek has blended in so well it takes the animal a moment to realize it's standing on a living thing, and as the fact dawns on it it panics. As it makes to leap off of him he snatches it by the snout and holds it against him, trying to calm it with gentle petting. The lizard sits in his grasp completely tense, and after the third stroke clenches its whole body even tighter, it's tail rigid and quivering in the air, and Darek feels a jolt race through his arm leaving it numb. The lizard lets out a screeching hiss and races away, and at the noise the first one flees as well. Darek stands and announces \"So they shock you\", and they agree they might as well go back, not willing to venture into the swamp they had discovered without greater numbers.\n\nBack at the ship Flint has kept a wary eye on the treeline as his men set to work to fell some trees, slow going with the injuries they sustained in the fall. Chatya reports their findings, and the crew urges them to get to the wizard before nightfall, they want whatever help he can provide to get them out of the jungle before things that go bump get hungry. So the two captains and their loyal drunkard step off into the pit once more.\n\nAn hour of careful travel passes and the trio is hip deep in tepid murky swamp water, occasionally sloughing away a mass of algae that has collected against their torsos. The water sloshes against trunks and reeds and slows their movement, and the ambient noise of countless bugs and birds is raucous. They make their way to a small hill poking its head out of the wet and sit back to back for a small rest. \n\nThen they hear something slip into the water.\n\nThe surface, calm since their reprieve, ripples once more, and the culprit is nowhere in sight. They hold their breath, weapons drawn and hearts pounding as they scan in every direction for minutes that feel like hours. But nothing happens. With a renewed sense of paranoia the group eases back into the drink, trying for land whenever possible. Atop another hillock, they catch the sound of a gentle, purposeful slosh in the water, as if something just out of sight moved with graceful determination to overcome the environment and achieve perfect stealth. They can see nothing from their position, but when they advance again, they spot a solitary track in the muddy bank of yet another hill, an average sized footprint, ending in four distinct claw marks. There is no other sign of life, but they know they are not alone. \n\nFrom this point on, the land is no longer in sight until shore, an expanse of a good 50 ft sits between them and the end of the bog. Darek lifts up his spear, nods to Chatya and Flint, and eases into the water once more as his friends set up position on solid ground, Flint watching their backs as Chatya kneels and peers down her sights to cover him. \n\nHis movements are painstakingly slow, sweeping forward to avoid losing balance as he goes ankle, then knee, the navel deep, when his feet catch on some form of roots and he struggles to free himself. He looks back to Chatya, affirming that she has his back, and he begins to saw away at the roots with his spear to cut loose. His motions cause the water to bob in growing waves, and pockets of reeds in every direction begin to sway with the ebb and flow. Something catches Chatya’s eye- a single reed, at first in tandem with the motion of the others surrounding it bows forward to point directly at Darek! She shouts a garbled warning, aims below where she believes the reed might end, and fires, but too late. A dart flies and sticks into Darek’s shoulder, and his arm grows numb as he pulls out a 5 inch thorn, whittled into a thin point, one end frayed open with a knife and the other stained a faded red from some unknown substance. He blinks, shakes his head furiously, and yanks his ankle free, taking up a defensive stance as Chatya reloads, staring intently at the offending reed, which now floats out into the open with no sign of its owner. Knowing his disadvantage, Darek pushes forward, determined to get to land where his agility can come back into play. Another dart flies, this time from his left, but neither he nor Chatya can determine the point of origin. Now up to his chest, he abandons any defensive posture and swims hard for shore, trusting his friend with his life. As he nears the shore Chatya beckons Flint with a gruff “We’re leaving!” before sloshing into the water herself, grimacing again at the damage this must be doing to her new boots. As Flint turns to follow, he sees that Chatya has frozen, glancing to her side, musket at her hip pointed towards the reeds not 20 feet away. He sees it then, a monstrous frog, barely peeking out of the water, staring intently at her, reed in its mouth. There is surreal pause as frog and woman stare into each others wide eyes, the black abyss of each other’s barrels hovering in wait. The frogs cheeks push, the trigger glides back, and another poisoned dart flies as bone and brain matter scatter across the water. A burning ache spreads across Chatya’s gut as she pulls the dart from her leather armor, and she decides the pain is nothing a woman hasn’t dealt with before. \n\nOutraged croaks sound from the reeds ahead, and two javelins sail towards them. The pair sidestep and unload every pistol they have into the concealment as the javelins pierce the air where their hearts had been moments before, and the reeds rustle as unseen enemies flee the onslaught. Taking the opportunity to quickly reload, Flint and Chatya then hoist up their arms and powder as they swim on their backs to keep it dry. They hit the shore that Darek has secured, and “tactically relocate” into the jungle ahead as quickly as possible. \n\nThey’re not out of the jungle yet though! (I apologize for that pun) As they run, Darek in the lead, another of their blue friends exposes itself on the trail, directly underfoot. Darek reacts quickly to leap over it, but unwilling to leave it at that, decides in midair that he’ll use the butt of his spear to flick the nuisance out of the way before Chatya or Flint need worry about it. He effectively flings it face first into a tree, and it smacks off the bark and hits the ground running, hissing as it darts straight for his ankle. Without hesitation, he spears it, pinning it in place as it lets out a high pitched hissing death shriek. The wail is immediately echoed not once, or twice, but over and over from every direction as the brush and trees begin to rustle violently. Chatya spends no time waiting to see what is in store and forces past her sodden companion, sparing little breath (“What did you do NOW?!”) before sprinting full tilt for the opposite wall of the pit. The lizards have swarmed from everywhere at once, a good 70 or more hell-bent on retribution. Darek reaches the wall and begins scrambling up with ease, but Flint’s beer gut is complicating his ascent and his old age worsens things. Chatya simply can’t find a good handhold, and she starts to panic. Backs against the wall, she and Flint draw again, ready to go down shooting, but Flint grins as he realizes the bulk of the horde are coming en masse right at him. He waits until the last second, and then lets loose a cone of smoky death as more than half of the lizards become a pulpy unrecognizable mass. Flint scrambles up the wall with newfound youth as the remaining foes screech from a safe distance, but Chatya simply can’t find her way up more than ten feet. As the wave surges forward to wait beneath her again, she leaps off the rocks over reptilian heads and makes for a nearby tree. Darek has caught drift of her struggle and sidles over to a suitable outcropping, tying off a bowline and dropping what rope he has to aid her climb. Chatya struggles up the branches and leaps from the tree, snatching at the rope and blessing years of manipulating rigging for callused hands as she dangles 40 ft above ground. The daunting ascent begins, and Chatya and Flint are desperately unprepared for the challenge. Even Darek, nimble as he is, loses hold once, but takes full advantage of his newfound ability to slow his fall to catch himself once more and carry on, leaving his comrades far behind. With trembling hands, sweat dripping from their faces, the pair clings to the rock, 60, 85, 120 feet up. \n\nAnd then the rock crumbles under Flint’s feet.\n\nHe plummets to the pit floor, and Chatya doesn’t even hear the impact. She rests her head against the wall, grimacing as tears fill her eyes, not for her friend but for herself, as she knows she’ll never make this climb. “I want to go back,” she whimpers. “Why the hell did we go into this pit?” She reaches out for another handhold, tests her fingers and begins to heave up, and she loses her grip. She falls, a gasped “No!” slips from her lips as she desperately grasps at the cliff face, and the two captains are no more.\n\n\nHope you guys enjoyed this as much as we enjoyed playing it! FYI- I handwaived the deaths for sake of excellent characters and epic plot, and respawned them at the top of the cliff to finish off the rest of the session. Happy gaming!\n",

        "text": "*RuneQuest has some of the most evocative combat that I've ever been a part of running, and I wanted to share the combat from the first session I've gotten to ran so you can see what I mean. This is basically a narrative retelling of exactly what happened blow for blow.* \n\nAs the boat erupted into chaos, our heroes, Gresh, Ealric, and Grimcytel, slowly found themselves back to back for what was likely their first meeting. Being slowly surrounded by combat, they locked eyes with the nearest pirates and drew their signature weapons. Ealric, seemingly paralyzed by the first real combat on his life let his opportunity for a quick first strike go by, but Gresh acted just as fast and fired an arrow into the left leg of one of the pirates, impaling her. Grimcytel faced off against a woman with superior reach, and threw his dagger at her to try and make an opening, but the dagger bounced off of her armor. In retaliation, she swung her longsword at Grimcytel's head, but with a brilliant flourish of his cutlass the blow was knocked aside. The man that was standing in front of Ealric took a testing stab towards him with his spear, but his point was off the mark. Finally, the woman in front of Gresh pushed forward and closed distance with Gresh.\n\nEalric responded to the missed strike with one of his own, thrusting his spear forward exactly like he was taught, but a combination of the shifting boat, the slippery deck, and a nearly perfect parry from his foe's spear caused him to slip and tumble down to the ground. Gresh alarmed at his companion falling, and at his foe's closeness, drew his cutlass and prepared to strike back. Grimcytel took this moment to try and slip under his opponent's guard, but her footwork was just simply better than his and he was stuck outside of reach. She responded with a quick swipe of her longsword which he barely managed to knock aside. \n\nUnfortunately things turned for the worst when the spearman standing over the fallen Ealric thrust his spear downwards, burying its head into Ealric's chest. Ealric went still. Gresh suddenly realizing the danger of the situation went for a beautiful swipe at the chest of his opponent, slipping through a part of her armor, and causing her blood to start to spill, but she managed to grit her teeth through it and keep fighting. Grimcytel and his opponent shared a few blows but nothing connected, and Ealric's opponent pulled his spear from Ealric's back.\n\nIn a beautiful maneuver, Gresh swiped down at his opponent’s leg, cutting deep enough to hobble her and causing her to fall to the ground as her leg could no longer support her body. Grimcytel realized that he needed to get to a better position and attempted to back off and regroup with others, but as he did this his opponent swiped down at his left leg cleanly biting deep into it. Grimcytel managed to endure the blow, but he was severely wounded and he was stunned from the pain. His opponent took his moment of pain to reclose the distance and the spearman also stepped forward and engaged him.\n\nIn a purely horrifying maneuver, the spearman trusted his spear forward with the strength of kings and stabbed through Grimcytel's wrist so cleanly that his hand was hanging by threads of flesh. Gresh realizing that the battle was entirely lost, backed up and jumped over the side of the boat hoping to regroup at a later time. Then the storm hit.\n\nEven more chaos happened as waves and rain smashed into the boats and everything seemed to go dark for Gresh.\n",

Thinking I'm going to die anyway I break off a spring off my bed and I start trying to pick the lock on my door for probably the 20th time since I had been there, though this time i managed to open the door. Though this ended up fucking me over as well since the angry ass guard managed to hear the sqeaky door as it opened. At this point I was pretty sure I was going to die since the only thing I had on me to defend myself was a bed spring. When he got too me I went at him with my trusty spring. And with a single high roll killed him instantly with a stab to the eye with the wire from the spring. After somehow killing the guard I grabbed his terrible(though better than a spring) short sword and started up the stairs from the dungeon that had been my home for almost a year. After I had armed myself, I headed through the massive temple complex trying to find my way out. Instead I found a very small room that looked like it was used as a nursery, contained my son sitting in a small wooden crib. Having a sudden fit of maternal instincts kick in, I scooped up the kid and continued trying to find my way out. Coming into a central chamber with huge statues of demons lining the marble walls. And sitting in a small spiked evil looking throne on the other side of the room was the demon lord of the temple. Looking at her I knew I was about to get fucked up, she was twice as powerful as I was and probably would take the entire party to kill her. Since I knew I was going to die, I thought I would be funny so I just tried to lightly throw my short sword at her, but instead I got yet another perfect roll aaaaand I chopped her head completely off. And as if on que my party burst into the room, looking rather bloodthirsty. Only to see that I had just singlehandedly saved myself and I had waited an entire year when I could have just busted myself out.",

Anyways after we had returned we hit the taverns for a bit of drunken tomfoolery. During this drunken tirade my character, I whom after drinking waaaaay to much dwarven mead, stripped put on a crown and began dancing on top of one of the tables. unknown to me apparently the crown and several of the other trinkets i had put on were pretty fuckin cursed. Lucky for the other members of the party only I, a dhampir assassin, and his ingame best friend, a female human sorcerer, actually put the shit on. Because if you take it off it transports you to a temple, where your supposed to give your soul to a Demon lord as part of some ritual that the drow in my game did, and after a bit i took the crown off and next thing I knew my drunk naked ass was sitting in a circle of seemingly angry cultists, right next my friend who began puking her guts out thanks to failing a constitution check, I who had also failed a check passed out in my drunken stupor. The sorcerer attempted to fight off the demons and, by some miracle, landed a perfect roll on a cone of fire spell that gave her the time to escape, while my happpy ass snoozed on the floor. When I woke up, I was on a cot with a gown on getting stared at by some red skined demon chick who stared me down like I was a piece of meet. Saying what the hell I opted to try to seduce her and thanks to a high persuasion I then proceeded to have sex with a demon lord, but a little homebrew rule we have is that when sex happens if you role anything under a 3(on a 20 sided die) boom pregnant.

        "text": "This one might be a bit long. So my friend and I co-dm a 3.5 campaign in our own custom setting we call Treloth with a seriousness level ranging from a 4 to a 6. Our group is pretty big, consisting of an incredibly flamboyant Half-Elf Paladin (wears heavy armor, a tricorn, and a scarf), an Alcoholic Elf Sorcerer who can drink dwarves under the table, a Human Fighter who apathetically cleaves through battalions with his great sword, an unusually polite Half-Orc Monk who has a unique talent for torture, a human cleric of Pelor who only speaks when he is confused and surprised (Nothing but \"WHAT?!?!\" from this guy), An elf rogue who is inherently too lazy for his profession and typically forgets to check traps and charges for loot rather than stealing it (the fighter puts him in a choke hold if they find a loot room), and an Ancient Grey Elf wizard who almost exclusively learns utility spells which he uses in unconventional ways and is almost assuredly totally  insane (Once rode a horse out in front of an enemy army, 10,000 strong, and proceeded to display his privates prior to their siege). They are also traveling with an NPC, the Wizard's Nephew, a Grey Elf Samurai (Long Story). \n\nThe players were around level 5 and were approaching this massive sea that's smack dab in the middle of one of Treloth's continents. The Wizard, though crazy, is also remarkably perceptive and astute (compared to the other players) and correctly guessed the approach of some seafaring missions. He decides to equip himself appropriately. He demands that I allow him to find a horned viking helm. After several shop keepers turning him away, I finally let him have it. He was even willing to deal with some kind of spell fail but I thought the image of a 302 year old wizard charging into battle with a horned helmet was too funny to pass up so I made the helmet Magical. 15% spell fail while wearing it originally, increase spell success by 15%. Basically null. He then proceeds to strut around town informing the townspeople of his status as the Viking God King of the North. One man tried to inform him that they were in the south but he claimed that;\n\n\"My Power is so great, I reversed the poles. WELCOME TO THE NORTH LAND MY SUBJECT!\"\n\nEveryone brushed him off as nuts. That is, until, he found a random beggar by the docks. He wants to roll to convince the guy that he is indeed a God King. I think to myself, \n\n\"this should be dumb. Give it a DC 25 since his charisma sucks ass\" \n\nHe rolls a natural fucking 20\n\nThis beggar is totally convinced. The wizard then gives him a huge sack of money and tells him to spread his gospel. The beggar spends the next hour raining gold coins down onto any poor people willing to listen to him, which became a lot. He now has his own religious following in this random port town, so what does he do next? He goes sprinting towards the docks screaming \n\n\"The God King lives. I take my bride, the sea. LET US MATE!\" \n\nand he jumps into the water like a psycho. His people rejoice. The other players have to fish him out of the water before he drowns.They never go back to that town but they still worship the God King of the North... in the South.\n\ntl;dr Crazy Wizard buys viking helmet and bribes beggar to tell others he is a God \n\nEDIT: Fixed Spacing. \n\nAddition: Thanks for all of the comments everybody! I have tons more stories about Griffin the 302 year old wizard and all of his friends and it makes me happy to know other people like them. :)",

        "text": "Hey guys! The following adventure has happened during my \"World of Dead Gods\" campaign (more about which you can find here: http://redd.it/2zkzi4 ). My players wanted to make a lot of money in a few months because they were planning to buy a manor and create a school/academy for both fighters and mages alike there. It is part of their long - term plan to lead an army. So to make money they came to a place filled with dangers and opportunity in equal measures: Morkoth, the Black City. \n\nMore about the city can be found here: http://redd.it/30adxq ). The TL,DR version is: Morkoth is a huge coastal city built upon the ruins of a city created by a mysterious race, the \"Ald\", who disappeared hundreds of years ago. It is a lawless place that welcomes outcasts and criminals from all other lands and is effectively ruled by the Black Guild, an extremely powerful circle of mages/alchemists who do weird experiments and create horrible beings. \n\nOne of the PCs, Vestor Rothrak, has actually been born in Morkoth and learned his skills of thievery and assassination as a street urchin and later a gang member. Vestors own crew was wiped out by a famous arenafighter named Dorki \"Threetoth\" and his men after being betrayed by his own right-hand guy, and he was looking for revenge too. \n\nAs the PCs arrived in the city they began exploring it. They took residence in the \"House of Banners\", a fairly high-class tavern in the Diplomat - quarter, one of the safest areas in Morkoth (surrounded by a wall guarded by soldiers from one of the many embassies). Getting in there and being allowed to stay did cost them quite a bit of money, but they decided that it was worth it. \n\nVestor, who had brought some of his agents with him, told them to gather interesting gossip and news and look for money for themselves. He then started to break into various small shops in Mudtown, a task that was easy to do with his level of skill, and brought him a nice little profit. He also rented a shabby little appertement somewhere in Mudtown. \n\nLoros started contacting various Galeru fighting schools and also looking for work as a hunter, capturing rare and dagerous water-animals for various purposes.\n\nSandro started mixing with the upper class on the Aldhill immediately and found out his character was pretty good at playing cards. He would proceed to earn a small fortune from gambling, even making it into the final rounds of several larger tournaments. He also was able to form \"friendships\" with several decently powerful people who were working for one Goldlord (i.e. member of the Gould-Council) or the other. \n\nAregar did was Aregar does best: looking for someone to fight. He found his opportunity in one of the many arenas in Morkoth: the Arena of Wings. He fought two fights there as the \"masked gladiator\", winning both fairly easily, even though he had to take on decent opponents. \nWith these wins he walked to the biggest arena in Morkoth, the Silver Arena, owned by Goldlord Muretan, and said he wanted to be one of the top fighters there. The arena manager, looking at the newcomer, and hearing he was froum outside the city, offered him a unique opportunity: make a name for himself forever. If he where to fight the current arena champion Encratis and survive, he would be richly rewarded and the whole city would know the name \"Aregar\". \n\nThis was a fairly interesting scene for the player, because he was fairly sure his character didnt stand that much of a chance against the arena champion (keep in mind, this is a city of a million people with a LOT of dangerous fighters around). The character Aregar however, firmly believes he can win against whoever he faces. Thus the player, fully knowing about the danger he was in, made his character accept. \nAfter a while, when hearing about the exploits of Encratis, who was nicknamed \"the God of Death\" and had fought 92 battles in the arena, winning them all, and even beating 15 men at once in one fight and a \"Redclaw\" (a massive, bearlike creature capable of ripping apart the better part of a regiment of soldiers and one of the Black Guild's better known creations) in another fight, the bad feeling got even worse. And then he heard that people did not bet on his victory, but instead were merely betting how many \"drumbeats\" this new contester would survive against Encratis...\n\nVestor had made contact with a rogue member of the Black Guild in the meantime (an old man named Vorcicer who for some reason totally freaked him out) and was buying a steady supply of poisions and little gadgets from him. Sadly these actions did not remain hidden from the eyes of Lemor, Vestor's former second-in-command, who had betrayed his friends and in the last few years risen to the position of a sub-commander for the \"Streetwolves\", the biggest and meanest streetgang in the eastern part of Morkoth. Lemor couldnt find Vestor easily, but he knew his old \"friend\" would be back soon enough, and thus paid quite a bit of money to everyone around to keep an eye out for Vestor and alarm him (Lemor) as soon as he is spotted. Lemor also put together a deathsquad of about a dozen of the meanest, most ruthless streetfighters he could find, and told them to be ready to capture Vestor dead or alive...\n\nSandro was starting to become good friends with a man called Orafal, a skilled duellist and high-ranking member of the organization of a Goldlord called Kyros. Sandro helped Orafal to provoke the sun of one of his rivals, a young man named Kobben, into a duel, and was second to Orafal during said duel in which Kobben was killed (completely \"by accident\" of course, since the duel was only supposed to go to first blood). Kobben's father, a merchant named Machiel, was less than pleased. This would lead to unfortunate consequences for Sandro later on.\n\nVestor and Loros had started breaking into houses on the Aldhill itself in the meantime. These were very well guarded, but the combination of the PCs skills and their magic made them a formidable duo, striking several times and disappearing without too many problems, earning them a hefty sum. Their usage of magic during the breakins would, alas, soon be noticed by the Black Guild, who hated it when someone else used magic in Morkoth, especially when said mage drew attention to himself (and breaking into houses of powerful people does draw quite some attention). \n\nIn the meantime Vestors agents had heard about a big gangwar in the western part of Morkoth. There the two rivals gangs of the Darkhands and the Lionsons had joined forced with a few smaller gangs to challange the ruling gang, the Bloodfalcons. Their leader, Boss Orrik, was losing ground and starting to get a bit desparate. Vestor's agents indicated that he might be willing to pay a huge sum to whoever helped him out. The Bloodfalcons controlled a huge part of the city and were basically an army, thus they would have a nice pile of money hidden away somewhere. The PCs thought they might get to that money, one way or another...\n\nIn the meantime the day that Aregar had to face Encratis, the God of Death, in the arena, had dawned. The players were all really nervous, but Aregar (the character) was not to be stopped. The fight would become a duel that would enter the legends of Morkoth. The two gladiators faced each other in a circle of metal pillars with dozens of wicked blades stikcing from them, so that each wrong step could lead to a quick and bloody demise. \n\nAregar took his best shot, used all the magic he had in a covert way (bosting his own strength, endurance and stamina) and fighting on the highest level he might have ever had, but Encratis was better. Still, Aregar managed to wound the champion, a feat that had not been accomplished by anyone for years, and thus the crowd decided to spare him, even as he was lying in the sand, bleeding from a deep wound to his upper leg muscles. He did survive the wound with some help, even managed not to lose his leg, and henceforth became known in Morkoth as \"the Survivor\". \n\nThat was just the beginning of my player's adventures in Morkoth. Many more things were yet to come, and many secrets to discover. Stay tuned and thank you for reading! Comments and questions are appreciated, as always. I am aware that this might be a bit much content, expecially because you guys dont have as much information about my world as the player have, but I hope it was a fun read! \n\n ",

        "text": "Biffo Proudbottom was a small folk with great ambitions, greater tails, the plucky spirit of most hoobits (otherwise called small folk, but never another name that is copyrighted), and a general distaste of stairs. These stairs in particular. They had already spent almost two days walking down a spiraling stair only to find out that the chamber it ended in was not, in fact, the end of it all.\n\nAt least he could see a further than the next few steps. The room he was in was vast... easily extending further than the meager light of his lantern. Biffo turned around, looking into the... well, he wasn't sure what that room was. It was decidedly odd in construction. A foyer, he supposed. Maybe some sort of gateway. It separated the spiral stair from this huge room by a couple score of paces.\n\nThe vast chamber though, stretched out in front and to either side. No ceiling was visible and the floor was an unknown distance below. He'd dropped a coin and never heard it hit a floor. He was currently perched on an ironwood landing with stairs descending to his right.\n\nBehind him the rest of the party, he wasn't sure yet if he'd call them friends, were busy arguing with each other. One had gotten trapped in a giant pit. The others had figured out how to free him... but not until after they had ransacked the several nearby rooms. It was a matter of no small contention.\n\nBiffo looked through the railings, trying again to see something down below. Best he could tell there was some sort of sullen red glow. Were they high enough that he was looking at a cloud? Stranger things, he supposed, had happened to hoobits before.\n\n\"I really don't want to walk down more stairs,\" he sighed. A glance over his shoulder, eyeing the archway and the beginning of the spiral stair. \"Or walk back up that spiraling nightmare.\"\n\nHe hefted his shield and started back to tell the others the bad news--that a new stairway awaited them--when inspiration struck. He stopped and hefted his shield a few times. \"Yes... yes, that will do nicely!\"\n\nTen minutes later, he was at the top of the new stairway. He tested the the straps, making sure he was secure. Grinning, he leaned forward.... His shield, well oiled, began to slip down the stairs like a sled down an icy hill. The lantern strapped to a pole, itself strapped to his back, bobbed about but lit up the stairs well enough he saw the first turn in time. A lean and a jerk and he shot around the corner. Laughing maniacally, he raced down the stairs!\n\nOnce, twice, three times careened his way through the switchbacks. As fast as he was going, he wasn't too sure of the distance between each... at least a hundred paces! He was moving so fast now that instead of a rapid, drum-like, thrum his shield was making a ripping, buzzing noise beneath him.\n\nAnother one! Lean! Twist! Grip!\n\nThat was close! He barely saw that one in time, and he was going so fast that... wait. There seemed to be more light than his lantern....\n\nOh my. The stairs above him were guttering to flame. His bottom was becoming rather warm. \"Next time, don't use lamp oil!\"\n\nAnother switchback. He was going too fast!\n\nWith a tremendous crash, he burst through the railings, his attempt and turning doing little more than turning him sideways as he flew through the air. Tumbling. The lantern died. He was sure he was close behind!\n\nWith a loud bang Biffo hit the wall! Then suddenly another! He was in a corner? But now he was flying into the darkness, a line of fire swooping in and out of view above. A sudden thud was the only warning as he crashed back onto the ironwood... and immediately shot down the steps.\n\n\"I beginning to regret this!\" he wailed. At least he was moving a little slower, he could dimly see the next switchback ahead, lit by flecks of falling embers from above. The turns came again, and again, as he raced down the stairs. Embers drifted about him, like Hellish snow.\n\nBones aching from the continuous buzz of impacts, he once again lost control and shot past a switchback. Twirling through the air, he saw a beautiful and awful sight. A shower of red motes, like a vast curtain, stretching away to one side and another. Again he crashed into a wall, bouncing to another, spinning, and another! And then he was skipping across some surface. Was it? Could it be? It was!\n\n\"The floor!\" Biffo shouted with glee.\n\nHe slid across the floor, by some miracle still upright, spinning slowly as his speed abated. Laughing. Crying. Whooping.\n\nA turn. The shower of motes with a crazy zig-zag of gentle fire where friction-heated oil had started fires in the ironwood.\n\nA turn. A cloud of red dots, more sullen and darker than the fire.\n\nA turn. The embers were dimming as the tough ironwood shrugged off the flames.\n\nA turn. What were those red dots? They were above him, but not by much. About as high as a human's head, he thought. An awful lot of them, too.\n\nA turn. He was moving sliding at an angle, the wall to one side, the cloud of red dots to the other. At least the spinning was slowing down. Maybe he'd get a better look at....\n\nA turn. \"Why, that's quite funny, they almost look like...\"\n\nA turn. He swallowed. The wall, with its comforting embers scattered at its base, was quite far away.\n\nA turn. \"Eyes...?\"\n\nBiffo skidded to a stop.\n\nTo one side was the giant wall, with a staircase of more steps than he could imagine, zigzagging its way to the spiral stair far, far above.\n\nOn the other, were red eyes. Hundreds. They weren't reflecting the dying fire behind him.\n\nThey glowed from within. A bright red glow that was somehow dark. Nefarious. Evil.\n\nThousands of eyes.\n\n\"Don't mind me,\" Biffo whispered.\n",
