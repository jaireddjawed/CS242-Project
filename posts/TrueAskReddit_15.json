        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/87fjst/how_does_it_make_any_sense_to_compare_nations/",
        "text": "This has kind of puzzled me for quite some time. When we compare a massive giant like say the USA to a country like UK, and say that \"oh the USA has the largest GDP in the world,\" is this really even a sensible thing to say considering the fact that the USA is like a massive bloc that represents 50 separate states combined? These separate states are practically like their own nations. Look at a state like California; wouldn't it make more sense per say to compare California and UK as opposed to UK and USA? The only reasonable way to compare this is to run it up against the EU, or China, or India, which are all also unions of various states (although EU is actually just a trade agreement). \n\n\"USA is a superpower\" is often heard in global media, but let's just step back and analyze this statement for a second. We are saying that this collective block of 50 states in North America is a super power across the world. The same could be said for EU if they had a united army.\n\nTLDR: I'm basically lost as to why a combined bloc that represents 50 separate states is compared to individual tiny states across the world, and then have it referred to as some power powerful entity. Would it not make more sense to only really compare the USA with other things that represent multiple states and/or some entity which also takes into account multiple states?\n\nIn any case, I hope I was able to explain this in a way that makes sense. Cheers!\n\nEDIT: People seem to think I’m only referring to comparisons of GDP. I mean a comparison really of any sorts. People say USA is mostly a cultural unity, I think you guys are mistaken. I don’t understand how it really makes sense to compare a 50 state bloc with any other smaller state.",

        "text": "Is it possible for a new site to pop up that would A) Become popular B) Not be bought outright by a giant like Facebook, Google, or Amazon and  C) Respect it’s users privacy? \n\nNow obviously, the very nature of social media sites is subject to putting yourself out in the open. There will never be total privacy, but what I’d like to see is a respect towards users: complete transparency regarding how their data is being used. Not being subjected to a flow of information from third parties trying to warp opinions and influence elections. I understand companies wanting to use your data to sell you products or services, but things get more dicey when you add a company like Cambridge Analytica into the mix.\n\nI look at the sheer influence of corporate giants, our politicians in bed with said giants, and our government’s complete disregard for privacy/lack of regulation if certain big businesses, that it’s hard for me to imagine there ever being a social media site that wasn’t used for nefarious purposes. Perhaps it’s the cynical nature in me speaking. \n\nYes, we should vote locally and support politicians who champion policies that speak to  the average voter, but time and time again, it looks as if money seeps in and plays a major role in how our country is influenced. With that comes outside parties taking advantage of the flow of information. With how intertwined money, lobbyists, and politicians are, how is it possible to enact change when the very nature of our election process largely favors the candidates with the most money?\n\nIs it pipe dream for a social media site that 100% respects its users to exist nowadays? Is it inevitable for outside influence to seep in and infect the original vision of said site? \n\nI don’t mean to get on too much of a tangent. You could also factor in first past the post, the news cycle of bombast and outrage, and the two party system. There’s been a lot of different issues going through my mind the past year or two, and I’ve seen how they influence how they influence different facets of our government. I personally struggle to see how a social media site that reaches that masses while simultaneously respecting its users could ever come to fruition. Not to mention third parties like Russia.\n\nWhat’s the sub’s thoughts on this? ",

        "text": "Before the Internet, censorship in wartime was pretty 'easy', comparatively speaking. Letters would be blacked out, newspapers would be limited by what they could print, etc. \n\nBut how about now? The Internet is a vast network that is practically impossible to block off, creating a gigantic informational nightmare. As a crude example, Private Joe in Country A is part of an army group that is being moved quietly to prepare for deployment, and his wife posts about it on Facebook. Voila, Country B's agents can easily check their location, cross-reference with other data from other facebook accounts, reddit, instagram, etc., and build up a pretty good idea of what troop movements are happening. \n\nHow do you think governments will act in the event of war to stop information leaks? Try to halt access to the internet? Enforce or even ban forums like Reddit? How would you even start to restrict online gaming when I can log into a MMO and chat with someone from the other side of the world? \n\nI should note, I don't mean war as in largely one-sided wars like Iraq or ISIS. I mean full-scale war with relatively-evenly matched parties, like Russia, China, the US, etc. ",
