When she told me which college I was kind of shocked because it is an extremely religious school that teaches stuff along the lines of how the earth is only a couple thousand years old and that Genesis 1 is to be taken literally (so all of creation was made in 7 days). \n\nI got curious and looked up the curriculum and as I expected, no coursework on evolution, literally just general bio, genetics, cell bio, and organic chem. Also marine biology for some reason. In fact, there were more theological course requirements for bio majors than biology courses. \n\nI don't know her personal beliefs on evolution or whatever, but I am a little worried because she told me that she wants to do grad school for genetics and I'm wondering if she'll even be accepted into any grad schools with that curriculum? How do you even teach genetics under the belief that evolution isn't real? I'm also wondering if they'll present misleading ideas under the pretense of \"science\". I'm also pretty sure the program was added only a couple years ago and she would be the only person there pursuing that major (pretty small college)\n\nI don't want to tell her not to go there, but also I want her to be successful and I don't want her set up for failure.",

I may go for my masters a couple years down the road, but right after I graduate I want to get a good feel for what it’s like to work in the biology field before considering additional school. I’ve gotten some great insight from a couple of people on here, but I just wanted to make a post to see what other ideas come up. I feel very lost and nervous about post graduation so I will take absolutely any advice and suggestions.\nThank you in advance :)",

I do it by what feels like activating/flexing a tiny muscle that's near my throat (it's hard to pinpoint where, it's a strange feeling difficult to locate) and it releases adrenaline. It makes my heart beat faster, it dilates my pupils and it gives me this electricity-like feeling in my body. It feels like a low cost version of adrenaline, just without the fear or the sweat. I can only do it for a few seconds before it gets unbearable and if I do it too many times then I feel drained and have to wait for a bit before doing it again at full force.\n\nI've read on some random forum posts about other people who can do that but there's never been an official explanation or name for that phenomenon. What happens exactly in my body when I do it? What's the thing I'm activating?",

        "text": "For some reason, after however many intense bio courses, I still don't fully get gametes vs somatic cells.\n\n* Each and *every* cell in the human body has 23 chromosomes in sets of homologous pairs (46 individual chromosomes total). One of these pairs are the sex chromosomes (#23). So this means, in every single cell of our body, we have sex chromosomes. Additionally, each chromosome in a homologous pair have the same genes but may differ in alleles.\n* BUT these sex chromosomes (#23) are not synonymous with *gametes*. Which are exactly the same as somatic cells just *not in pairs*. So they have 23 chromosomes flat, with the 23rd still being the sex chromosome? If it's not in pairs, does that mean female gametes only have 'X' and males only have 'Y' (even though in haploids its XX and XY respectively?). Additionally, how does a gamete \"decide\" which of the homologous pairs to have (and thus which alleles will be passed down) out of the 2?\n\nWhere am I wrong/right? I hope my questions make sense and someone can clear my confusion!",

I have been diagnosed with few concerning things that can as well lead to worse things. (Im still going under more doctor appointments) That is not the main reason. So two days ago I was in terrible state and woke up on the hospital, apparently my watch sent the alert to the medics.\nI haven’t told my family yet, my family isn’t very close. As well it is quite complicated.\nIm 24 and I have always been very healthy and I have kinda been the ‘’healthy image’’ of everyone in my family. Mentally and physically.\nBut it seem by the day my body is shutting down, im very physically ill. I work a lot and not working and not be able to focus on my studies has caught on my mental health.\nIm not sure how to tell people about it, as well I can tell im in denial of my physical health. Which is understandable since I have never been sick like this and when ever I get sick, such as cold and more I always get full recovery fast. But now is way to serious.. \nDoes anyone have some advice? From their own history or others?\n\n(Excuse my English, my mother language isn’t English)\n\nThank you very much!",

        "text": "In 2016, an observation had been made in Israel's Negev Desert of an unlikely union between a pack of Arabian wolves and a single striped hyena.   At first, it could be dismissed as kleptoparasitism, with the hyena shadowing the wolves for an easy meal, except that the hyena was found in the middle of the pack.  In a desert, this doesn't sound ideal, but in fact, both species benefit from this union.  The hyena takes advantage of the wolves' higher speed and agility, whereas the wolves, in turn, exploit the hyena's stronger sense of smell, its ability to crush through bone and dig through burrowing prey like tortoises and even its skill at breaking open tin food containers!  This, clearly, is an exciting find, especially in a place where peace is so sorely needed.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut the fact that this mutualistic behavior has not been mentioned again in the seven years since the first discovery has cast some doubt.  Was this alliance ancient and that we were a bit late to catch up?  Or was this a one-time fluke?",

Microcaecilia unicolor is an amphibian species and I am having a hard time finding its approximate longevity data. I don't know if there are research groups that study these organisms. I request that fellow biology enthusiasts/ biologists of this forum help me find resources or the answer to my query. I shall be much thankful if someone could help me out here.",
