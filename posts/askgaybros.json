Despite pretty loud and clear enthusiasm from them all.

There is no ambiguity here, so don't try to argue that. \n\nBut in the end, 7 committed to a day later, and all flaked. Lesson: Meet NOW, or you never will. Don't wait til the next day.\n\nEdit: Apparently my decision to not wait for guys anymore has really ruffled some feathers. \n\nLook guys, I'm not telling you what to do, and I'm not denying the potential success stories in waiting. \n\nBut from my own experience, that just does not work for me. So I'm not waiting anymore. TBH, I'm getting older and have wasted way too much time to online strangers that I've never met.

I discussed how most of my friends and family at this point have gotten married and drifted off, I don't know any other gay people where I live and I've found it difficult in my area to meet other gay people people so I've been feeling very lonely and needing a change. Others informed me that it is common for young gay men in rural areas to relocate to city\/ bigger metropolitan areas and suggested that maybe it can be something to consider.\n\nI've thought about it, have been listening to other people's advice and am considering making the move to a city.\n\nMy thing now is what city should I move to? How do I know what city would be good for me? Aside from how the social scene may vary from city to city, there's other factors at play too such as the job market, the pay (I'm a nurse) and affordability as a single person on one salary... I know the most obvious answer would be to go visit different cities, explore and see which would be a good fit but that is expensive and I can't get that much time off of work.\n\nSo long story short, some feedback and advice from you all may help guide me in my decision making. What city do you currently live in? Where have you lived and or traveled to and which cities would you recommend that are gay friendly and easy as a young gay man to put yourself out there and meet people? I don't want to make a move to a city that has little opportunity and be stuck in he same position I am now.\n\nWest coast cities are all beautiful but the cost of living is super expensive and not really doable on a nurses salary. Same with Florida, cost of living in cities like Miami has tripped and nursing pay remains low; same for Denver. I've heard conflicting information regarding Arizona cities. Chicago is less expensive that other mega cities but I've gotten mixed feedback on nursing pay.\n\nTexas cities all have popped up numerous times, especially Dallas and Houston. The cost of living is very affordable for such large cities and Texas remains one of the highest paying states for nurses; not to mention the climate is warm\/hot which I like. However, when I mention pondering the idea of relocating to Texas, everyone asks me why I would ever even consider relocating to such a Red, conservative anti-lgbt state from Connecticut which is very democratic, even if the cities in Texas offer more opportunities.\n\nI guess they have me second guessing myself. Since Connecticut is so democratic and everyone suggests it's more gay friendly as a result, then what am I doing wrong that I am hain so much difficulty meeting people? Is it just because there aren't any huge cities in CT that is making it difficult? Like I said, I don't want to relocate and be worsoff than I am now and people have me worried that it's me, not Connecticut and that I will have the same problem no matter where I go.\n\nSorry that was long winded. So any suggestions on different cities would be great. Also, does anyone have any experience with CT?

I have many interactions with straight people all throughout middle and high school about my sexuality. \n\nHomophobia is homophobia, and there isn't much reason to distinguish when is worse or the worst. I'm just tired of the sentiment that \"Women aren't homophobic\" or \"Women are more accepting\". While that may be statistically true, they can also be horrible allies. \n\nOften times, I'll have female friends that out me to someone else, because me being gay is a \"fun fact\" to get to know me better, they dont understand the weight of that information. That I'm \"one of the girls\" which, isn't just not true, but also objectifying and condescending. I'm not a gay best friend to flaunt around like a piece of jewelry. \n\nIn other cases, I'll meet women who are way too curious about my sexual life. They ask me if I like to top or bottom, and what kinks I enjoy. I understand it's a part of girl talk, but what really bothers me is when they make a lot of sexual jokes or they insist on preferences when I've already told them I don't enjoy certain acts, it almost feels like theyre imagining me doing them. It feels like I'm being fetishized. \n\nI've had women flirt with me or try to touch me because they heard I was gay, either they're trying to embarrass me or turn me straight, I don't really care, it's just gross overall. \n\nNot to mention how they intrude on our safe spaces because they are \"tired of getting hit on\" only to hit on gay men around them. \n\nI guess the point I'm trying to make, is that I've had more experience with straight women objectifying me and crossing boundaries than I've had with straight men hating me. The times I've met homophobic straight men, they usually keep it to themselves. I'm not saying violent, hateful straight men don't exist or aren't scary, it's very real, and makes me panic at the thought. \n\nI just want to see some gay folk share the same sentiment or experiences they've had with straight women.","upvote_ratio":0.54,"created_utc":1678676787.0},{"title":"When more guys want you after you start working out","author":"Tony481","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askgaybros\/comments\/11qayzr\/when_more_guys_want_you_after_you_start_working\/","text":"So I\u2019ve never had trouble getting guys or hooking up.

He's pretty shy and introverted, so in the beginning it was just fun, at least I didn't think much more of it. A couple months ago for the first time he seemed to really want to get to know me more and was engaging with me more. He was showing some signs that he really liked me, so me unsure how I felt about him, pursued him a bit to see where it led, but it kind of stayed as a stalemate. Basically, he had a pretty big wall up with me.  He wasn't letting me know more about him as he was very closed off but would get really excited when I would text him, always respond right away, and he was learning a lot about me (I am very open), but I kind of just carried on and decided we can just stay FBs as it was just a weird dynamic and felt imbalanced. It was really hard to pursue things if he was so closed off and me being so open. \n\nI reached out to him yesterday see if he wanted to meet up for fun. He responded right away, was super friendly and engaging telling me about his day, asking me how I have been. He then told me that he was just starting to see someone so he's not trying to have fun at the moment. It must have happened within the past two weeks because him and I were supposed to meet up two weeks ago, but I had a death in the family and a cold so I cancelled.\n\nTo me I was like \"Okay that's the end of that, time to say goodbye to him.\" It was then suggested we connect on social media. So I told him very kindly and respectfully I would respect his boundaries and that I really wished him well, and that I was happy for him. I ended with saying \"good luck with everything.\" His response? \"Thanks handsome. I think I am going to need it.\" \n\nOf course, with a baited statement like that, I asked what he meant lol. He laid out to me that the guy he just started seeing he feels is untrustworthy and not the most stable. He's known him for some time through mutual friends and he is just not sure how it's going to go. He's going to give it a little bit of time and see what happens but he's really not sure how he feels about him because he knows about some pretty shady and bad situations the guys has been in. He's only giving the guy a chance because he said he has changed but my FB is not sure if he really has. I started to ask more questions to be supportive (and curiosity), and he started to become more vulernable about the fears with this guy and what not, and he just didn't know about him, if it would go anywhere.....\n\nI say all this because it just felt odd to me? First that he's all of a suddenly divulging all this information to his fuck buddy he doesn't know well, and for the first time I felt he was being vulernable with me. I can understand if we were friends, but we are not, our relationship has for the most part been transactional. But he was really opening up to me about this guy. I dunno, I feel like when you start seeing someone you just cut it off with your FB, and say goodbye? \n\nBasically I just kept asking myself: \"Why is he telling me all this?\"","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678715190.0},{"title":"How to spice things up, if simple masturbating gets boring?","author":"AnxiousShithead02","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askgaybros\/comments\/11qa08g\/how_to_spice_things_up_if_simple_masturbating\/","text":"Without having to buy sex toys, how could i have more fun again?

Generally, the mood swings between \"we need all the help we can get \\[subtext: even if it's a gay Republican\\]\" to \"fuck em, he's a traitor.\"\n\nAren't there some studies that exposure to an immediate family member or friend who is gay generally shifts their beliefs to being more tolerant? I know that's been my experience. I grew up in conservative places, I've seen the hate. I've also been closeted and seen how people change when they find out that I'm gay. People, family and friends, reconsidering their stances because \"wow, you're not what I thought\". Are there some people that whispered shit behind my back? Of course there were. You're not going to change them.\n\nSo what happens to people if they're gay but their views generally don't line up with Democrats? We've only got two parties that are electable so take your pick.\n\n I'd sooner have more openly gay people in Congress that clearly support gay rights than people who pay lip service when it's convenient but actually fail to defend them -- because it's not *really* that important to them, see, and if you're a Democrat, your vote is already guaranteed because we self-respecting gays would *never* vote Republican, right? So what incentive is there to put up a credible,   \n spirited defense if there's no chance they'd lose the gay vote? Just think about us the same as you might think of \"the Latino vote\". \n\nI think the presence of gay Republicans means a few things:\n\n1) People who can clearly change the party from the inside (refer back to video above)\n\n2) Make the Democrats earn those votes by prioritizing pro-LGBT legislation\n\nFrankly, I'd rather guarantee the election of a gay Republican Congressman who has a stake in LGBT issues than taking a moral stand by refusing to run as a Republican. I mean just look at the guy in the video.

Or am I just doing something wrong in my life? Or possibly just living in the wrong area?\n\nI'm a young gay guy in my 30's and I am so lonely and depressed and it's only getting worse as I get older. Everyone around me (like all of my friends and family) have gotten married and\/or had kids so they've mostly drifted apart. On the rare occasion I'm invited out or go to any functions, I'm always the third wheel and unable to relate to anyone because we are in such different phases of our lives. So needless to say, I don't really have any friends left, nobody I can call up to talk to\/ do things with and so I just go to work, come home (I live by myself), read, sleep and repeat.\n\nMy dating life is non existent because (despite living in the Northeast which is liberal and supposedly the most gay friendly area) I don't know where to meet other gay men. I've never had a relationship and don't even remember the last time I went on a date. Additionally, I don't have any gay friends, don't even know any other gay people and rarely encounter other gay people in my day to day life... The only place I know where you can potentially go to meet other gay people are gay bars which 1) there's only a couple that I know of within an hour from me, 2) bars and clubs are not really my favorite scene, 3) I don't have any friends to go with and 4) from my experience with the times I have gone, most of the men in there are just looking for hookups and not interested in making friends and\/or dating.\n\nI've been to New York City which is 2 hours from me and is the closest big city to me; I attended the pride parade there one year and I felt so out of place and unable to relate to the other gay folks I met there that I got back on the train and went home... Same thing with Miami. When I went there to visit family, I went out there to some of the gay neighborhoods and gay clubs and felt like a complete foreigner and unable to relate to anyone. Everyone was half naked or dressed really provocatively; many were doing various drugs out in the open (and no I'm not just referring to weed) and most just seemed fixated on trying to find their next hookup\/sexual encounter... Apparently many couldn't even wait to get home for that because I walked by several getting oral behind palm trees or in the parking lots.\n\nSo my take on it (and correct me if I'm wrong) is as a gay man, your options are very limited and on top of that, they tend to be black and white with not much room for variation. You either have to accept living a certain lifestyle or try to fit this stereotypical image (dress a certain way, act a certain way, either be skinny or muscular, etc) as a gay man to have any hopes of being deemed \"acceptable\" by the rest of the gay community in order for you to be able to meet other gay people and not be lonely, or you just have to resort yourself to being permanently lonely\/ single and just deal with it (which I'm obviously struggling to do). There aren't as many different options to find your \"niche\" as straight people have it seems like.\n\nI've taken antidepressants and over the years have seen a couple of different therapists who specialize in LGBT issues, but none of it has helped and it's only gotten worse because neither of those things can resolve the loneliness and emptiness that I feel.\n\nWhat is your take on this and what have your experiences been? Is how I'm feeling and what I'm experiencing the norm as a gay man? Because this is absolutely not the life that I want to live, not how I want to spend my days feeling and I cannot accept having to feel the way I currently do for the rest of my life. Not to sound morbid, but I would rather go to sleep and not wake up than continue to have to feel how I feel now day in and day out.","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1678646645.0},{"title":"Help about pep","author":"Vivid-Initiative-756","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askgaybros\/comments\/11pytfk\/help_about_pep\/","text":"I was sexually assaulted by a unknown man, he was unprotected when he penetrated me.

I don't think he's happy about it but he is not mad anymore. Thanks for your replies <3.\n\n# !!!WALL OF TEXT!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**AN OVERVIEW HISTORY OF MY BF AND I**\n\n>*TL,DR: Friends to fwb to boyfriend. Broke up once for a year due to me being hyper-sexual and he being too jealousy. Now back together, bf became closeted again after failed coming out attempt. Promises to come out once financially independent but still spends wastefully. Our relationship is private, he only sees me on the weekend and seems neglectful of me in weekdays when I am not around.*\n\nMy boyfriend (lets call him A) and I were dorm-friends, we became fwb and committed to a serious relationship.  We started dating in 2020 and broke up later that year. It was messy as I found out I was hyper-sexual due to my unhealthy relationships before which he wasn't ok with and developed extreme jealously over every male friend of mine. I broke up with him for our own sake despite being in love with him. In 2021, I asked him to get back together because I was in a better state mentally and we did. Everything was going smoothly until around 3 months ago I became doubtful of him and whether this relationship would work in the long run.\n\nA is closeted. He tried to comeout before we first broke up but his mother occasionally tried to ask him to seek therapy *(!!she is not homophobic, she is just very uneducated on LGBTQ+!!).* After we got back to each other, he specifically asked me to keep our relationship hidden until he can be financially independent from his parents. His dream is to be a professional e-sport player. I was totally ok that and believed in him. It has been 1 year and I saw little to none lifestyles changes that help him reaching his goal. He barely shows up to uni classes, goes to cyber cafe everyday for hours, has no saving because he spends a ridiculous amount of money monthly for an average uni student. His friends *(who he shares an apartment with)* are over-the-top wealthy so I think they unintentionally distorted his views on economy. We are not living together, his place is far from mine so he only visits on the weekend, also his friends don't know I am a man. So you can see our time together are private but short. When we are alone, I am his priority, but when he's away, I don't even know if I am in his top 10. He would send me tiktok sure, but barely any messages. I am jealous of his friends, especially his close friend-who-is-a-girl. I endured the raging pain because of love him. I tried to talk to him about this a long time ago but he told me to not teach him how to live his life....\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THE VACATION.**\n\nI have my jealousy, he has his jealousy but I think he controlling me too much. I am going on a solo vacation right now. I decided to stay over at a my close friend (B) to save some money because the hotel rate is out of my budget. My bf knows I am gonna stay here but he didn't know there was only one bed. We have to share bed because his place only has one room and this makes A upset. Although I get where he is coming from but the three of us know each other for 4 years now and are pretty close. I have shared bed with B for years before my boyfriend and I met too. And B is strictly straight, but he is a man, and my boyfriend is jealous of any man I counter. I am lost. This is my first day of the vacation and I already wanted to go home. I don't know what to do or say that wouldn't upset him. I am scared that he would misunderstood my intention. I don't want to cause a fight in my vacation. I can afford a hotel for 10 days but then I will have to use up the money that I am planning on saving for my sister's present for her wedding next month. I am overwhelmed, tired, please help...\n\nP.S: please ignore the grammar issues, i am panicking rn...\n\nEdit: updated some info about the vacation.","upvote_ratio":0.4,"created_utc":1678696356.0},{"title":"Thinking of hitting up Steamworks Berkeley for the lights out event tomorrow!

I ruminated a lot this past year after graduating online college kinda thinking I wasted my youth, because I didn\u2019t have a traditional college experience like lots of my peers and high school friends did and didn\u2019t really make lots of friends or anything or learn how to socialize w groups and such. Right now Im in a small town and I realize I\u2019m only in my early 20s once and I hope I\u2019m not completely wasting them. I am determined to move to an area with people like sf or la and going out there and going to gay bars. Im so tired of Grindr where I\u2019m at and people ghosting me and shallowness. I\u2019ve never had a boyfriend or even gone on a date before. I\u2019ve only ever had grindr hookups and my gay life is reserved to group chats and Grindr. I have barely come out to my family, I only recently told my brother and have yet to tell my other one. \n\nAm I freaking out a little too much here??? I just ask because I feel so behind. the gay friends I have all live in cities and all have all seem to have grown up and gotten over insecurities and depression and they have all this confidence and friends from their colleges they go out to bars with and I feel like I\u2019m still extremely shy and working on meeting just general friends. I feel like my peers have lived their early 20s happy and finding out who they were and I lived at home with my mother in my conservative hometown and barely got in touch with my gay side. \n\nHow do I feel better about this? How do I feel better about my life and not like such a loser? I know I\u2019m smart and capable enough and my friends say I\u2019m too cute to be lonely but I miss out and let opportunities pass me so much. Would going to grad school and getting that traditional school experience I missed out on help me out??? Should I move to a big city like sf or la and do that or move for work there? Right now my job is giving me the opportunity to move and I don\u2019t like or hate my job but it offers decent money and experience and I can work anywhere since we have locations all over. \n\nIm sorry to make such a sob story. I still struggle with low self esteem and I feel even sadder nowadays and I have no idea what to do with my life sometimes and I\u2019ve never felt lonelier and more worthless ever. At one point I even started to self harm but stopped because I realized it wouldn\u2019t lead me anywhere and hurts so bad. I probably need to take medication for my anxiety and depression. I already see a guy who\u2019s been my therapist for about 7 years now and he only helps incrementally. I think the only way i can be happy is by putting myself out there. \n\nIn my efforts In my small town there\u2019s a gay bar I started going to by myself, however I feel so awkward and I don\u2019t know how to approach people especially cute guys. How do you do it when you go to the bar by yourself and they\u2019re with their friends? I just stand in the corner and awkwardly look at my phone and people watch and see everyone having a good time. Tho keep in mind the \u201cgay bar\u201d I go to is the only one in my small town and lots of straights go there too, so I\u2019m afraid of approaching a straight guy too and hitting on him. I feel like I would have confidence to approach if i had friends to go with at the bars, that way I have support. \n\nAm I overreacting here? Has anyone else here gone through a really long phase of depression in their adult life and managed to get over their insecurities? How long did it take for you to fully come out of the closet in every facet of your life? What did you do? How can I get over myself? Is it by focusing as much as you can to better yourself in the present?\n\nI have a hard time accepting my past. I feel hopeless sometimes because it feels like it defines me, I\u2019ve felt inferior to my friends who went to uni for years and I want to change my life asap and be happy.\n\nI wish I could talk more about this, if it\u2019s okay my dms are open if someone is willing to listen to me and help me out there too.","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1678669635.0},{"title":"Masculine and feminine energies exist in different biological sexes to varying degrees","author":"theoelihp","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askgaybros\/comments\/11q5ux5\/masculine_and_feminine_energies_exist_in\/","text":"I have this theory that in the 2 biological sexes, the masculine and feminine exist to varying degrees.

The guy could be the hottest hunk on the planet but I won't even get hard. In fact those type of guys on Grindr etc who seem to think that a blank bio is sufficient and a pic is enough because they go to a gym don't turn me on at all. They make me cringe.\nThe idea of going over to some gay dudes house to have gay sex just bores me.\n\nIt doesn't really even matter to me what the guy looks like. I've slept with a large range of men from really fat to older to buff but the one thing they need to be good at if I am to cum hard is role play.  I can still have sex and cum but it feels like a real effort and struggle to stay hard if there's no RP.\n\nYesterday for example this dude came over and played doctor. He made me strip and gave me a full medical. I was rock hard the whole time and came really hard. Without the fantasy role I would not sleep with this guy as he was not my type at all but he kept his clothes on and took on the role of authority figure and that turns me to putty in anyones hand.  The scenario is pretty much always the same for me. I'm in a vulnerable position and being taken advantage of and I'm telling myself that it's ok because I'm being told to do it by the authority figure and so it's not really gay etc.  I'm always the submissive role.\n\nI have no idea why I'm like this but it's been this way for years. I was in a very long term relationship and I kind of trained my partner to do it. After many years he grew bored of it and wanted \"normal\" sex. I really struggled with that and kept reverting back to the role play. We aren't together anymore.\n\nIt's hard sometimes because it reduces my chances of meeting anyone etc. If I hookup I always try find someone else into it. I have this one other FB who comes every now and then to do it. I find younger guys are less willing as general speaking they are less experienced and tend to be too inhibited etc.\n\nAnyway I've come to just accept that I'm kinky that way and enjoy it when I can get it.

Right away, we immediately had a vibe. At work, we would hang out, chat, exchange ideas, talk about sports, girls, life, and our family. Literally, in person, we really engage with each other. We wished each other happy birthday, and he also did me favors when I asked.

To me, I find it so difficult to decipher his mood\/emotion behind his straight forward responses sometimes, and the direct answers. And, in person, we can go on, and on, with chatting. \n\nI like his personality, his vibe, and just how respectful, chill, and honest he can be. I literally go to him with rants about our boss, and we engaged in chatter, with a \u201cLMAO\u201d responses. I\u2019ve tested him with my thoughts, and he doesn\u2019t tell anyone else\u2026.

Last week I was really horny and bored so I went on tinder and met up with a guy. He is the sweetest and most comforting guy nothing like the others. We talked a lot and after that we kissed a lot and did other stuff (no sex tho). After that we saw each other 3 other times. We hug a lot and hold hands and kiss a lot. It makes me feel really good. He doesn't make me do anything I don't like which is almost anything beside kissing, I also try to blow him but I guess I am not good and I don't really like it. He has been to mine and I was at his and even met his brother. We now chat a lot. He even said he would want me to hug him rn, cause I am not in town now. I am scared I am going to catch feelings. \n\nThe problem is that I haven't had a gf since I was 16-17. I haven't had any relationship kind of intimacy and touch since then. I went out with other girls after but just on first dates. I was in a really dark place( and still kind of am) so these weren't things that interested me. Girls don't seem to be attracted to me. So I have made up with the fact that something is wrong with me. But some guys do find me attractive. So the question is. Am I bi or do I use guys to get me off and for validation. Am I getting attached to this guy because of my sexuality or because he gives me the things I've been craving for for years and because he makes me feel wanted and attractive and not broken.\n\nIt's worth noting that he is not out.

Banana peels, lunch bags, a sandwich, a squishy toy I had, a school book, mud, couch cushions.  Most things worked out well enough, even if they weren\u2019t actually all that exciting.\n\nI had this ping pong ball gun that I used as a toy sometimes.  The ping ball gun was basically just a plastic tube with a rubber lip that used suction to propel ping pong balls out with some force.  One night I got the bright idea to put my penis inside it.\n\nUpon trying it out, I quickly realized that my penis was too big to fit.  I could barely squish some of my head in there. \u2018No problem,\u2019 I thought.  \u2018I\u2019ll just get soft and put it in when I\u2019m smaller.  The tight squeeze once I\u2019m hard will feel great!\u2019  Well, I was about to learn.\n\nI go forward with my plan.  It took a while to get soft, but eventually I got there and stuck my penis inside, which quickly started to engorge again.  It didn\u2019t take long till my penis was pressing on all the sides.  I only stuck about a third of my penis in without rolling back my foreskin, so I decided to try pushing inward before I got 100% hard.\n\nThe moment my skin started to roll back, some of it got pinched in-between the rubber lip and the hard plastic pipe.  I instantly felt pain and panic.  Upon trying to pull out reflexively, I only increased the pain and could not remove my penis.  At this point I was half-panicked and in pain.  This lasted what felt like 30 seconds, but it might not have even been 10.  I realize that my best escape is to get soft.

He bought the tickets, and I paid for the popcorn. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a bad time. After the movie we talked about why gay dating in LA is so horrible. We also have different interests. He likes to read, (nothing wrong with that) and I\u2019m more of a movie kinda guy. I also realized by talking to him that I\u2019m more well versed in pop culture than he is. Not a bad thing, just something that made conversation between us interesting. He also brought up that me being black made me a fetish for guys in LA. And that lots of guys will want to fuck me but not date me. I didn\u2019t bring this up, he did. \n\nSo, I tell him to text me when he makes it home (it\u2019s the southern boy in me lol). So, he does actually text me that he made it home safe, and that I was funny to talk with. For whatever reason, I just don\u2019t respond. Well, that was last month. In the meantime I took all the guys #\u2019s\/text conversations I had collected in the last few months and deleted them. Like, blocked and deleted 10-12 of them. These were guys who had pretty much left me on read, or guys I never wanted to see again. I also never saved their number in my contacts either. Apparently I deleted his too. \n\nOn Wednesday. I get a text message saying \u201cHey how you been?\u201d from some unknown number. I ignore it because I don\u2019t know the number. Friday (yesterday) I get another message saying \u201cAy!

An issue I have had with him since we met is that he is in a long-distance relationship but never talks about it openly, like anything I know about it I have had to ask which I do find pretty strange so I feel it has put me in a place where I was not able to take their relationship too serious. A couple of months ago we were hanging out and ended up holding hands and kissing. The next we talked about it and both agreed that we should not continue any of that behavior as we both felt guilty but wanted to keep the friendship intact.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEverything was going fine for about 5 months as I was able to convince myself that those feelings were no longer there. In that period he did write me wholesome little cards and made me a sweet lil playlist that I discounted as just something that friends may do but I couldn't help to feel a little conflicted but pulled through nonetheless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently it was his birthday and after going out we went back to his place. We were in his bed just talking and laughing about random stuff as friends do but I think after some time we ended up cuddling. I went in for a kiss but I felt he looked reluctant so I backed up and laid down. He then came on top of me to kiss which lasted a little bit because I began getting in my head about the situation. I left and as soon as I got home (we live about 5 minutes apart) I quickly realized I had left my debit card so I messaged that I would get it sometime soon. After some slow back-and-forth messages, I returned around half an hour later to obtain my card. I met him at his door which led to more kisses that moved back to his room where it became a foreplay ground for the next few hours. No actual penetration sex occurred but all the other basic sex stuff went down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next day I messaged to check in and he mentioned that he needs some time to himself and it's been around 5 days since it occurred.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have been in a rut of guilt about everything and at this point, I am wondering if a friendship is even possible. From the outside looking in, it is a pretty disappointing situation as I would not want to be the one being cheated on that has happened to me before so I am contributing to that issue. Although I may have feelings for him, I also never really seen myself in a relationship with him as (like I mentioned) he does not seem to take his current one that seriously but of course, that is from the outside looking in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Essentially I would like to know if we should no longer be friends?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFeel free to ask questions or express your opinion(s).","upvote_ratio":0.4,"created_utc":1678581533.0},{"title":"i just washed my butt","author":"depressedloseromg","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askgaybros\/comments\/11p929n\/i_just_washed_my_butt\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.22,"created_utc":1678608366.0},{"title":"I attracted a batshit crazy clingy \u201cfriend\u201d.

We met off a \u201cfriend finding app\u201d (Wizz) and went from there, I didn\u2019t know him before or what his tendencies are.

I recommend you Copy and paste To keep in mind whenever they bring this study against you.","author":"Entire_Insurance_532","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askgaybros\/comments\/11ol3j7\/critic_arguments_to_use_against_a_study_commonly\/","text":"I can not address ALL the studies they often use but I will address a common one that they use most.\n\nA study called \u201c The proportions of heterosexual and homosexual pedophiles among sex offenders against children: an exploratory study\u201d by KURT FREUND mid ROBIN J WATSON in 1992 Spring. that suggests that \u201cthe resulting proportion of true pedophiles among persons with a homosexual erotic development is greater than that in persons who develop heterosexually.\u201d \n\nThey will then argue from the that homosexuals are more likely to be pedophiles than heterosexual. They have clearly only \u201cstudy the proves most pedophiles are gay\u201d then only skimmed through the abstract then trusting that it is a reliable proven \/ \u201cfactual research\u201d (out of confirmation bias and bad faith) rather than reading, understanding and analysing the WHOLE study including the methodology probably because most people don\u2019t want to invest in research studies and critic skills.\n\nThe study is very flawed:\n\n1. Research Question: The research question of the study was to investigate whether the etiology of preferred partner sex among pedophiles is related to the etiology of preferred partner sex among males preferring adult partners.\n\n2. Methodology: The study used phallometric test sensitivities to calculate the proportion of true pedophiles among various groups of sex offenders against children. The study also took into consideration previously reported mean numbers of victims per offender group.\n\n3. Data Collection: The study collected data from sex offenders against children who were referred for assessment to the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry in Toronto.\n4. Analysis Methods: The study used statistical analysis methods to calculate the ratio of heterosexual to homosexual pedophiles.\n\nCritique of the Study:\n1. Sample Bias: The study's sample consisted of sex offenders against children referred for assessment to the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry in Toronto. This sample may not be representative of all sex offenders against children or the general population. Therefore, the results of the study may not be applicable to the general population. \/ The individuals in the study were referred by psychiatrists who were assessing them for lawyers or within the prison system. This raises questions about the representativeness of the sample and whether the findings can be extrapolated to the larger population of sex offenders.\n\n2. Phallometric Test Sensitivities: The study used phallometric test sensitivities to calculate the proportion of true pedophiles. The reliability and validity of phallometric tests have been questioned by some researchers. The phallometric test may not be a reliable measure of sexual orientation or pedophilia.\n\nRemember that study that used phallometrics on \u201chomophobic heterosexual men\u201d and found that they had sexually arousal to gay porn but the non-homophobic heterosexual men didn\u2019t? There can be other factors  that made those straight men have sexual arousal that doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect their sexual orientation as being secretly homo such as anxiety sometimes and more confounding factors.\n\n\n3. Causation vs. Correlation: The study suggests that the proportion of true pedophiles among persons with a homosexual erotic development is greater than that in persons who develop heterosexually. However, the study does not establish a causal relationship between homosexuality and pedophilia. The study only establishes a correlation between the two. \n\n4. Small Sample Size: The study only includes 463 nonpsychotic sex offenders against female or male 6-11-year-old children, which is a relatively small sample size. This raises concerns about the representativeness of the sample and the generalizability of the findings.\n\n\n5. Data collection: The study relied on self-reported data from the offenders, which may not be reliable due to the social desirability bias, where offenders may underreport their true actions to avoid further punishment.\n\n6. Inclusion criteria: The study excluded individuals who had offended against children of both sexes, which may have biased the findings and led to an underestimation of the prevalence of bisexual offenders.\n\n7. Statistical analysis: The study used a nonparametric statistical test to compare the proportions of heterosexual and homosexual offenders, which may not be appropriate for testing differences between groups.\n\n8. Self-Selection Bias: The study only included individuals who agreed to participate and be referred by psychiatrists, lawyers, or probation officers. This may have led to a self-selection bias, as those who did not want to participate or were not referred may have different characteristics and behaviors.\n\n9. Limited Age Range: The study only included sex offenders aged 18-55 years old, which may not accurately represent the age range of sex offenders as a whole.\n\n10. Incomplete Data: The study only collected data on the gender of the victims, and did not collect data on the relationship between the offender and victim, or the severity of the offense. This limited data collection may have affected the accuracy and validity of the findings.\n\n11. Imaginary Group: The study created an imaginary group of sole-incest offenders against female children to account for the lack of an analogous group. This approach may not accurately represent the characteristics and behaviors of sole-incest offenders.\n\n12. Use of Labels: The study labels offenders as either heterosexual or homosexual, which may not accurately reflect the complexity and fluidity of sexual orientation. Additionally, the study defines pedophilia as sexual attraction to prepubescent children, which may not accurately capture the full range of pedophilic behaviors and tendencies.\n\n13. Potential Stereotyping: The study notes that almost all individuals in the sample were white, which may indicate a potential bias in the referral process or selection of participants based on race. Additionally, the study uses the term \"mentally handicapped\" to describe some participants, which may perpetuate negative stereotypes and stigmatize individuals with intellectual disabilities.\n\nBased on the flaws and biases identified in the study, it is not possible to draw any reliable or valid conclusions about the proportion of true pedophiles among persons with homosexual erotic development versus those who develop heterosexually. The study's flawed methodology, including its small sample size, non-random sampling, and reliance on self-report measures, undermines the study's validity and reliability.\nFurthermore, the study's conclusions are based on the assumption that individuals who self-identify as homosexual or heterosexual accurately represent their actual sexual orientation. However, research has shown that sexual orientation is complex and may change over time, and self-identification does not necessarily reflect an individual's actual sexual behavior or attractions.\nTherefore, it is not appropriate to draw conclusions about the prevalence of pedophilia based solely on an individual's self-reported sexual orientation. Additional research using more rigorous and unbiased methods is needed to examine the relationship between sexual orientation and pedophilia.","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1678543725.0},{"title":"Can anal sex cause constipation?","author":"pleasedontjudgeme13","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askgaybros\/comments\/11oorj8\/can_anal_sex_cause_constipation\/","text":"https:\/\/www.gutsense.org\/constipation\/anal_sex.html#:~:text=Anal%20sex%20causes%20constipation%20for,rectum%2C%20which%20is%20quite%20small%E2%80%A6\n\nI found this as the first search result and now I am concerned.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678553211.0},{"title":"Visiting Lexington, KY","author":"Manor4548","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askgaybros\/comments\/11oxgbj\/visiting_lexington_ky\/","text":"Hey - In mid-May, I'm going to spend a weekend with a FWB in Lexington, KY.

We found out that both of us is gamer (gaymer if you like) and it was really good finding someone. We did this for maybe a week, then he asked me if I would like to come over and he hopes it's good if Detroit has only just English subtitle. (Detroit: Became Human is my favorite game, what I can't play because of my limitations, I mentioned this to him earlier and it was really nice, that he remembered). I immediately said yes and was on my way to him. We met, talked a bit, he said that he is in the learning phase on his job and stuffs like that and then he opened Detroit wich was loading something for a real long time, so we closed it and watched Star Wars: The bad batch. We talked a lot about Star Wars, theories and favorite characters and his little finger was touching mine. I did the same and a few minutes later we were full on making out, then loose our clothes and sucked each other off. Then I was laying on his chest and do 1 more round before I needed to go home.\n\nOn my way out we added eachother on Facebook and he said that next time I will play and he will watch. Again I was very happy that he count on a second meet, so on my way home I was listening the Heartstopper soundtrack and maybe I felt something, wich you call love.\n\nBut here comes the but. One week later he got his job, and because of this he wake up 6 am and get home at 7 pm in the better days, and the job is really mind tiring as he says, so I support him since day 0 and still do. I asked him when could we meet again, just to see him, and he said that not in this week for sure. Well this hit me like hell, and I don't even know why, but I cried myself to sleep.\nSo because of this we can't meet in the weekdays, and we can't even meet in the weekends because I study at university and I go home for the weekends.\n\nAfter 2 week our meet up we discussed an another meet on Sunday afternoon, when I will get back. The days prior we were chatting back and forth and each of us really couldn't wait to meet again, but Sunday morning as I said this he didn't said anything back and this continued all day, until in the evening he wrote that he was very sorry, but his train was late and his roommate was already at home. So again, I was very said but understand, however it's suspicious that he saw my texts and didn't said anything for the whole day.\n\nBut 3 weeks after our first meet he said, that he will be available in the weekend, and I said fuck and I stayed. We met at Saturday just after noon. I gave him some chocolate which he immediately put the closet. We went to his room, the Detroit we're loading again overtime, so I pulled him closet and said, that I only want him and we again kissed, and sucked, and then we watched Bad batch again, and we slept a bit while I was in his arms, then he had sex with me a bit and I needed to go, cuz he went out partying with his co-workers, but he said that we can meet tomorrow. As I was walking out I found him on planetromeo and I jokingly asked that his profile said that he search for \"friend, love\" and wich one is me. He said: \"well\" half giggling and never finish this sentence. \n\nTomorrow came and he was online just for brief moments, then offline again for the whole day, then afternoon he said that he is really hungover. I wasn't mad of course, cuz I meet him yesterday so I was good.\n\nIt was almost a month ago. We didn't meet since then, I didn't asked, he didn't asked. But we didn't even spoke a lot. I always say good morning to him, and then he answers for me half our later, then nothing for the whole day, then at the afternoon he answers and go offline again. And this is our \"conversation\".\n\nHe never write to me first and just a few times asks about my day  and I don't know what to do. I like him, I really do, and I understand that he is tired after work. But I do the same. Not in the same workplace, but I go to classes then go to my job wich is just as mind tiring can be as his. \n\nI want to ask him out, but I'm really afraid of rejection. I tried to ask him on a date (not at his, ofc) but he said he will working on March 15 (it's a nation holiday in my country so there's no mandatory work on that day, but if someone will working, he will get double money, Wich he will do).\n\nSo here am I... Why do you think it is happening? And how could I have a good conversation with him? Is it even worth it?\n\nBriefly: the guy I seeing is working hard, he has no time, we only met 2 times and since then he rarely writes to me\n\n(Sorry for any misspelling or grammar error, English isn't my main language)","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678570560.0},{"title":"A sense of lost time?","author":"ValandaValdivia","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askgaybros\/comments\/11ovd36\/a_sense_of_lost_time\/","text":"I\u2019m 24yo and I feel that I didn\u2019t enjoy my 18-24 years and obviously they won\u2019t came back.\n\nI finished my studies and I\u2019ll move to a big city soon, so I\u2019ll really start living there enjoying concerts, having dates and much more, but sometimes it\u2019s exhausting feeling that I lost a beautiful age range just by being gay and living in a small city \ud83d\ude14","upvote_ratio":0.57,"created_utc":1678569379.0},{"title":"[Advice Needed] Size Issues","author":"advicethrowaway131","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askgaybros\/comments\/11o5ffi\/advice_needed_size_issues\/","text":"Last night, I \\[19\\] was with my boyfriend \\[18\\], and we were pretty excited, because it was going to be our first time, and we're both virgins.

We have had multiple flings over the course of the friendship and I regularly snap\/sext\/flirt with each of them individually. \n\nHere\u2019s where it gets complicated. Partner 1 has developed a bit of a crush on me. He\u2019s still deeply in love with 2 and is planning to propose soon, but he wanted to hook up with me one on one\u2026which wasn\u2019t their arrangement. \n\nWell, last week we did just that. Had some private fun at my apartment without Partner 2\u2019s knowledge or permission. \n\nA few days later P2 went through his phone (he\u2019s had suspicions of P1 cheating before) and found not just our conversation but P1 had hooked up with *another* one of their friends in private. \n\nP1 and P2 have since reconciled, but I obviously am feeling some guilt towards what I did to P2. P1 has told me we need to, understandably, take a break from the friendship. No problem with that. \n\nHowever, I am feeling like I owe P2 an apology of some sort.

I had been with Frida for 5 years and for 7 years before this she was my best friend. During the relationship I had battled with my sexuality and often saw our relationship as more of a friendship, but always thought it would pass - until I met Jon. He was a mutual friend to me and Frida. He was the first openly gay man I had ever really been close to. I fancied him a lot and eventually started to feel in love with him. This obviously made me realise I was living a lie. \nFrida and I broke up and it was a very traumatic time as we struggled to be alone. We are currently on a civil level. We talk sometimes over text and we share the same friend group so sometimes see each other that way. \nOn the trip as I was reminded of her I started to realise I do miss her friendship and also felt overwhelmed with guilt that I lied all that time, that I am the first to move on and that its with someone we both were friends with. \nI told Jon how I was feeling and he was very upset. He understood completely but said he felt very strongly for me and is sad that I was thinking about my ex all day. He also said it wouldn\u2019t be possible to be with him and friends with Frida still. \n\nSince that day I have felt emotionless almost. I wanted to tell Jon how much I loved him in the run up to this trip and now I feel like I have no emotions. I have felt strongly for him for a very long time now it doesn\u2019t make sense. I don\u2019t want to lose him but I just feel constantly anxious now. I struggled with big depressive periods during my final months with Frida and again a few months later and I\u2019m worried that this is what is building up now. \n\nMy situation is a little specific, but has anyone ever been in a similar situation?

There are many factors that contribute to the spread of STDs, including sexual behavior, access to healthcare, and social and economic factors. Therefore, it is not logical to assume that homosexuality is the sole cause of higher STD rates.\nThe very fact that two uninfected same sex men can do homosexual acts with each other and not be infected because the STD is not present proves it isn\u2019t the homosexual act itself that causes higher STD rates in homosexuals. It is unfair to say that a group is immoral because of their higher health risks. Heterosexual Black people have the highest STD rates among all other heterosexual races, does that mean  black on black heterosexual sex is immoral?\n\nPregnancy and child birth is an inherent consequence of heterosexuality and heterosexual acts yet according to the latest UN global estimates, 303,000 women a year die in childbirth, or as a result of complications arising from pregnancy. Is heterosexual act wrong now because many have lead to women DYING in child birth? \ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03\n\n\u201cA man isn\u2019t supposed to penetrate another man, the anus wasn\u2019t made for sex and the penis wasn\u2019t made to penetrate the anus\u201d\n\nThe argument that homosexual activity is immoral because the anus is not intended for sexual penetration is based on the assumption that body parts should only be used for their original intended purposes. However, this assumption is not valid, as human beings use their bodies in many ways beyond their original intended purposes.\n\nFor example, kissing involves the mouth, which is primarily used for eating and speaking. However, people of all sexual orientations engage in kissing as a way to express affection and intimacy. Just because the mouth is not specifically designed for kissing does not make kissing immoral or unnatural.\n\nSimilarly, engaging in sexual activities with someone of the same gender does not make those activities immoral or unnatural simply because they involve body parts being used in a way that was not originally intended. Humans have the ability to engage in a wide variety of sexual activities beyond those related to procreation, and as long as those activities are consensual and safe, they are not inherently immoral or unnatural. In kissing too, especially French kissing, you can be exposed to the bacteria of your partner from their mouth which COULd lead to oral bacterial infection. \n\nHomosexual individuals face stigma and discrimination in many areas of life, including healthcare in the homosexual population are at least partially due to systemic barriers and discrimination, rather than their sexual orientation. Another thing to note with this is the fact that there are more sex protection education for heterosexuals than homosexuals from a young age.\n\nSocioeconomic factors play a role: Studies have shown that socioeconomic factors, such as poverty and lack of access to healthcare, can contribute to higher rates of STDs. Homosexual individuals are more likely to face discrimination and economic disadvantages, which can lead to limited access to healthcare and higher rates of STDs. \n\nSources for this: \n\n1)Social Networks and Sexual Risk Behaviors Among Gay, Bisexual, and Other Men Who Have Sex With Men.

We were extremely close before anything, we saw each other everyday despite living 30 mins away, and going to diff unis, and if we didnt hangout we were texting each other or facetiming for hours at a time. We cuddled plenty, held hands and did all that shit. A few weeks ago however, i felt like we were going so well that it felt weird that we never talked about \"us\", and i did tell him that i really like him. Surprisingly, he was shocked that i liked him even though we have done so much that shows this feeling is mutual already. His reaction was normal, not vague, not heartwarming.\n\nEver since this happened, i feel like he started treating me like an asset, i went from being someone who constantly wanted to hangout with to someone that he has insured on the side. For example if we were going to hangout somewhere, he used to text me and meet up before we met everyone to have us time, now he texts me last because he \"knows that im always there and that I'll always show up when he needs me\". He went from being like super affectionate 24\/7, to like only occasionally doing anything. Went from texting me first thing in the morning everyday to me calling him and basically begging him to hangout. It's like a part of him likes resisting because he likes the validation he gets, but cant be assed to give back the same energy. Its like he is now only thrilled not by having me, but by the thought of having me. Kinda like the same analogy of someone buying a fancy rolls royce only to have it parked in the garage.\n\nThis makes me feel like i just want to like a take a break from him and make him realize my worth, maybe then he would care a bit about me. We have talked about this once and he just would excuse this change with that our schedules are changing we dont have as much time, even when i changed my week schedule just to be compatible with his.\n\ni do understand i am a bit too demanding with attention, and i thought maybe i should cool down with that beginning-of-a-relationship thrill, but i realized that whenever he would notice me not giving him the attention that i allways give, he would ask me whats wrong etc, meaning he still cares but not the same way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI sound like a 12 year old in love for the first time, but given my situation of living in a homophobic country, it is not everyday that i found someone that isnt a hopeless straight dude. And this is one of the first times i feel this comfortable with someone so i am really scared of losing it, He always talks about how we will be connected forever bla bla but idk.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678456930.0},{"title":"Don\u2019t know how I should message guy I never met","author":"Ok_Wasabi7971","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askgaybros\/comments\/11o1hnj\/dont_know_how_i_should_message_guy_i_never_met\/","text":"I\u2019ve never done something like this so was hoping to get some advice. There is a \u201cstraight\u201d guy that I want to message on FB but we\u2019ve never actually met and I feel like I may come across a little stalker-ish. Just a little back story - several years ago when my ex and I first started dating, he had hooked up with this guy a few times, I came across some of their old messages at the time which is how I know who he is. From his FB profile and social media he appears to be straight and had a girlfriend up until recently so my guess is he\u2019s secretly bi at the least. I think he\u2019s cute and am very intrigued by him. Recently I looked him up on FB and he moved to another city a couple of hours away so I feel like it makes it even weirder for me to send him a random message or friend request. One other thing, I used the explore option on Grindr to search profiles in his area periodically and about a week ago I managed to catch him on there so I sent him a message but he was already offline, the next day his profile and my message were gone so he either deleted his account or blocked me, but I don\u2019t have a picture on my profile so he wouldn\u2019t know who I was.

What I mean is when your peers and friends all started to enter relationships, get married and start families as most straight people tend to do in their 30's and drift away as a result, how did you \"rediscover\" yourself as a younger gay man and your path since the path of marriage and families are not the typical path for most gay men. How did you manage to meet new people? Did you have to relocate?\n\nI'm in this position right now. Literally everyone around me from family to friends has gotten or is getting married and having kids and as a result of being in a different point in their lives have mostly drifted away. Their free time now is scheduling play dates with other friends kids or going on dates with other couples. When I ask to make plans they're always too busy. I don't have any gay friends so as a result, I don't currently really have any friends left that I can call to talk to, hangout with or even grab a bite to eat with. The area I live in is a small town surrounded by other small towns so I don know any other gay people and there really are no opportunities as a gay man to meet other gay people or to even try dating.\n\nTo make matters worse, I live by myself which doesn't help. Most days, I come home from work, sit on my couch by myself, feeling depressed and cry. I would like to travel more since I'm young but have nobody to travel with and when I tried travelling solo, I just was depressed the whole time and spent a bunch of money to cry the whole time and not enjoy any of it.\n\nI've tried seeing a therapist and taking antidepressants but they didn't help because those things can't fix the loneliness and emptiness that I feel.\n\nI've considered relocating to a city where as a gay men it might be easier to meet other gay men like me and have more opportunities, however, the catch 22 is that the cost of living in most cities is so expensive right now which throws a wrench in things. To add to it, since I'm single that means I don't have the benefit of a significant other to split the cost of living with like all these couples I see buying houses; they can afford houses and living in a higher cost are a since they are fortunate to have a second income coming in from their significant other. So the question is, do I stay where I am and be miserable or do I move to a city and live paycheck to paycheck and not have the opportunity to put myself out there and meet people because all of my money is going to living expenses just to stay afloat?\n\nAlso, if I relocate, I wouldn't know anyone in my new location to help me network so how would I even begin?\n\nAnother factor is that with the limited exposure I have had in my life to the gay community, I have never really been accepted by other gay men and have faced a lot of ridicule because 1) I don't look a certain way (aka not skinny or muscular but not fat either) so I am considered undesirable and 2) I was brought up in a conservative family so I am traditional and kind naive to a lot of modern day things. I have noticed that many gay men don't take well to traditional values and criticize me terribly for it (despite the fact that I accept their values\/ beliefs). \n\nFor example, there were a couple of times I was asked if I would like to join in sexual activities with a couple in an open relationship. I politely declined and simply stated that I am more of a monogamous person. The aggressive reaction I got from them was alarming to me. They ripped me to shreds and accused me of having internalized homophobia because they claimed monogamy is a straight person's expectation. Please someone tell me that these negative experiences are not the norm in the gay community?\n\nSo as you can see, I am between a rock and hard place and have a number of challenges\/ variables that I have to try and navigate.\n\nCan somebody please give me some advice or feedback? I'm so lost that I almost feel like I need a life coach.","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1678469220.0},{"title":"What\u2019s a subtle way to visually tell people I\u2019m gay?","author":"unexpectedocupancy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askgaybros\/comments\/11n31b2\/whats_a_subtle_way_to_visually_tell_people_im_gay\/","text":"So I (m18) am going to college soon, and I ofc want a boyfriend.
