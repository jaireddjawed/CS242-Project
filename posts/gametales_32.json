        "text": "Hi there, so just a bit of a brief background of the campaign setting: The party is made up almost entirely of melee people, rough and tough mercenaries for hire - and they have come to the large port town of Sherwood in search of work. (I actually didnt even realize Sherwood -&gt; Sherwood Forest, so that was a funny in it's own) Normally I just GM/DM our games, and create a bunch of main characters that the story revolves around, however this time we have tried to go for a more casual open-ended campaign revolving around a city, and the players wanted me to create a DM-Character that joins them on their adventures (They claim that I don't really meta and that I break up fights and things fairly, so it wouldn't be biased based on what happens)\n\nWell my character, Aewin Steelsteed, the LE Cavalier, decides to start up an adventuring company, Aewin's Adventuring Association, or Triple A for short (AAA).\n\nDuring the first few nights of the campaign, things were going splendidly. I would recruit members, we'd build up a base of operations in the city, and my character would head to the Sherwood Questing Association to draw up questing contracts for the party and I. However, I did manage to leave out a few details of what my character does in between getting the papers and whatnot.\n\nFast forward to last week, the city is in danger of being run over by a horde of undead being controlled by a lich - no one has even the faintest clue why or how or anything. To top it off, the two major religions in my setting are having all out riots in the street, claiming things as sin and burning shops and brothels and everything else down. \n\nMy adventuring party was one of the first to encounter this lich out in the forest, and the Duke of Sherwood had requested our audience to explain what we saw. My character grew distant, and successfully bluffed his way into convincing one of the party members to take his place as Interim-CEO while I went and sorted out more paperwork at the Questing Association.\n\nThe party enters the court and are questioned not only by the Duke of Sherwood, but also two major figureheads of both religions in the town; one thing leads to another and they end up burning a child on a stake to purge the city of sin and prevent perhaps what is the apocalypse. \n\nIn the mumble-jumble of all the talking, the Duke and the city treasurer also pulled aside the Interim-CEO and began questioning him about the lack of paperwork and misinformation floating around all the tax forms that were presented to the city when I first started the company; this would've been dire trouble had not another riot started outside due to the death of the child, and the party fled out.\n\nThey shortly met after with me, and I asked them how it went.\n\n\"Oh the usual, something shady and a child was burned alive.\"\n\nI told them I had more quests for us to do, so we selected to rid an abandonded mining outpost of all these pesky lizard-folk living inside of it. During the fighting, the character that was the Interim-CEO at the time started trying to kill another party member (for seemingly no reason). This other party member was an Inquistioner who sided heavily with the purging of the child and the sacking of the city to come.\n\nI, (As a DM), couldnt figure out what he was planning, and I was pretty upset because it seemed so out of character and was fiddling with so many rules and just drawing out the night - but he assured me it had a good point.\n\nThe fighting continues and we pretty much end up getting into a standoff, CEO and party trying to stop the two from killing each other. After they're pulled apart and the fighting stops, my character bellows \"What is the meaning of this Richard?! (His name wasn't Richard, but I always called him something different to piss him off\"\n\nHe stands back and looks me dead in the eye and goes \"I just want honesty, Mr. Taxes!\" Then he looks back to the Inquisitor\n\nMy eyes widen, and I go \"So you figured it out smart guy? You've figured it it all out?!\" I begin to rant, the entire party looking at me.\n\n\"Is that what the FUCKING Duke wanted? Papers? Well guess what! There are none! The whole thing was a lie!\"\n\nThe party is confused, the Interim-CEO character more-so because he was actually trying to stop the Inquisitor thinking he was central to the Lich-plot line, but my dumb ass didn't realize this and continued going on.\n\n\"That's right! You think this hard work is only worth a few shiny gold pieces? HELL NO! I've been collecting all the money for the quest up front, then creating new contracts to pay you wads less than 1% after! I also didn't pay the city, and all of the money was sent off-shore so I could retire young on the beach!\"\n\nThe party looks shocked. Here they've been for weeks nearly dying, getting gnawed on by zombies, rolling down steep cliffs and fighting off hordes of orcs, and they've earned, collectively, a total of like 100 Gold from actual quests. \n\nThey all turn on me, the Bloodrager in the party crits me so fucking hard I die in one hit.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3hvkk8/starcraft_rpg/",
        "text": "I had asked if anyone in r/RPG was interested in the story of my Starcraft campaign, and Wabbafoobnog suggested this subreddit (I should have realized it existed!). So let storytime begin!\n\nWe started the campaign when half our regular D&amp;D group was out sick. I had been considering this for a while, so I asked them a simple question. \"Who wants to play a space western?\" This got immediate enthusiasm from the group- they all pictured things like Firefly and Trigun. I told them they were on the planet of Chau Sara, in the far future. Space colonists separated from Earth, no intelligent alien life, yadda yadda. They loved it. The characters were Al. a skinny little hacker guy (Picture scout from team fortress), Edna, a little old lady (Specifically described as Betty White) with a PHD in Xenobiology, Biology, and wielding a cane gun, and the third was a gun-toting merc type (picture Jayne from Firefly). Notice I never actually told them it was starcraft.\nThey started out in a diner. It was a slow period after shipping off some cattle, and everyone was kinda tired. They're about midway through their coffee when the phone rings-boss says its for them. Edna goes and answers, turns out its the sheriff. He's across the county investigating a mass cattle killing, and old man Maloney called him screaming about aliens. He was NOT in the mood to deal with him, so he called in a favor with the group and temporarily deputized them.\nThey went to investigate. Old man Maloney came out waving is shotgun, telling them \"Its here this time, but you can't see it cuz they's **INVISIBLE**\". The group just nods, tells him to go chill in his attic and provide a lookout, while they take their jeep and check the back 40. \n\nWhile they investigate, they find tracks from some kind of animal, Edna guesses about wolf-sized, with some kind of weird, loping gait. They conclude the problem is some kind of uncatalogued local fauna. Further exploration turns up a field covered in a purple, stringy glop. Edna (being immediately fascinated by unidentified life) immediately goes for samples. I tell the group it looks like some kind of giant slime mold, and Edna's player asks me \"Does it look like that zerg creepy stuff?\" I respond with \"Yeah, that's a good way to describe it.\"\nSo she grabs her samples, all of them are a little nervous from the thought of acres of slime mold, and that's when they hear a resounding BANG from the farm, and their collective thought is \"Oh no, Maloney is shooting at something, or worse someONE.\"\n\nSo the group rushes back to find old man Maloney coming out on his porch, waving his shotgun, and screaming \" I saw it. It tried hiding with its cloaking devices but I saw it!\" He told them he shot at the UFO and it fell behind the barn. They tell him to \"go provide a lookout from the attic. we'll call if we need you\". Maloney seemed to be OK with this, so they went to check out this damaged UFO. The gun guy (he didn't stay with the group long enough to remember his name) makes his perception check, whips out his rifle, and shoots at the little rippling shape heading around the barn corner (critical hit! blew the thing neatly in half!).\nHe rolls a critical hit, and blows the thing in half. Turns out to be some little gold robot thing, about 3 feet long. Some kind of blue crystal sensor on one end, and a small engine thing on the other. Al, being the tech wiz, is immediately awestruck-he knows this is WAY beyond what humans can do. He grabs the sensor end and starts inspecting it, looking for a seam or hatch to open this up and start investigating.\nAs they watch him play around, they realize it gives a little 'ping' noise every time they point it at the barn, and at Edna (who has the 'fungus' samples in her pocket).\n\nRealizing something must be in the barn, she pops her cane gun open, and goes to the open door, where she sees these st bernard-sized alien things digging up from the ground. She immediately opens up on these things. Gun guy whips the giant rifle again, and starts pasting them, one shot apiece. Al on the other hand, freaks out, grabs a jug of moonshine, smashes it on the barn, and proceeds to light it on fire. Edna ran for the jeep, and practically dives in, and one of these monster things tries to clamber in after her, so she starts shooting it in the face as she throws the car in gear. Al, in the meantime, has climbed the downspout, cornered by a pair of them. Edna floors it, scrapes the one off the jeep with the porch, and runs over the two so Al can drop on the hood.\nAs this is going on, I've had a soundboard up and have been playing zergling sounds as they run and die. Al's player finally looks at me and says, \"That sounds a lot like a zergling doesn't...\" \n\n**AND THAT'S WHEN HE REALIZES THEY'VE BEEN DUPED.**\n\n\"WHAT PLANET DID YOU SAY WE WERE ON.\"\n\n\"Chau Sara\"\n\n\"WE ARE ALL GOING TO F***ING DIE! THIS IS STARCRAFT!\" The other two look at him kinda confused, because Edna's player doesn't know anything about the universe, and gun guy only knows it from multiplayer. \nAs the barn collapses on the rest of the zerglings trying to emerge from the tunnel inside. Old man Maloney comes staggering out and holds his shotgun out to them, saying \"Save...Clarice...\" and falling down dead, with some kind of 8-inch spike jutting from his back. Al, realizing they are being invaded by obviously hostile aliens, grabs the gun, shoves them back in the jeep and they book it, intent on reaching a starport and getting the hell off planet.\n\n8/21/15 *It continues*\n\nSo, the party is in their jeep, booking it to the spaceport to get the hell out of dodge, when up ahead they see an APC- one of those big ones like in The Evacuation. Its surrounded by zerg and dead marines. At this point, another friend finally arrived, and we insisted he join. He almost declined, until we said it was starcraft, and he just looked at me and said \"Only if I can be a firebat.\"\n\nYes. I will allow this. Put some meat shield in the party. Heaviest armor there is, two flamethrowers, and two-weapon fighting. He was giddy. Rest of the party was about 50 feet out from the horde; sniper guy hops out and opens up, while Al and Edna just look at each other and nod. They throw the jeep into forward, run down two more zerglings, and pull a bootlegger turn to bat the third into a hydralisk. Cletus (our new firebat) immediately opens up with both flamers, missing every other shot (and still doing half damage!), while the sniper keeps sniping.\n\nAl, being the computer whiz, runs into the APC, overrides the controls, and proceeds to run down the last zergling that was closing on gun guy. Since the APC was big enough, they pull the jeep into it, turn it around, and resume the drive to town. Al gets to putz with the observer, while Edna catalogues her samples, and the others clean their weapons.\n\nAlong the way, they stop at a depot. Al tops off the APC's fuel, while the firebat (I think we named him Cletus) decides to go pilfer the armory. He comes back with several cart loads of grenades, firebat fuel, ammo boxes- anything that's dangerous and portable, and piles it into the APC. Things start going Night of the Living Dead- infested terrans start lumbering up to the perimeter, pulling and slamming at it. Thankfully the APC was ready by then, so everyone climbed aboard, and ran over the fence and the infested on their way back to the highway.\n\nEventually, they come to the capital. Smoke is billowing from numerous fires. Whole blocks lie in smoking ruins, and huge, blimp-like creatures float across the city skyline.\nThey scan radio channels for something *-anything-* on what's going on. All they manage to get is some sort of call for survivors to rally at the capital square. Al of course wants nothing to do with such a thing; he decides he's going to the spaceport instead. Since he's driving, the group has little choice but to go along with him.  Along the way, the group comes to a street taken up by a blast crater. Unwilling to double back, they take the APC across the ledge. The sunken street holds, but as they cross, their celebration is cut short, as some kind of enormous **thing** unburies itself from the crater.\n\nEveryone goes quiet as the players realize just what they're facing- an ultralisk. Al pretty much snaps-screaming, incoherent babbling, maybe a ruptured blood vessel or two. The full [Armin](https://youtu.be/9dnwJYSl7eo?t=1m18s). And so began the white-knuckle chase. Everyone screaming and panicking, as the ultralisk attempts to give the APC a sunroof (and nearly succeeds several times!). Several zerglings and hydralisks and zerglings make the mistake of attempting to intercede- each one being gunned down, run over, or crushed underfoot in turn. \n\nCletus comes up with the closest thing to a plan they can get right now- he grabs the fuel and grenades he had grabbed, and starts packing them into the jeep. Al finds a hospital- two halves relatively close, and connected by a skywalk. As they make the final piloting check, they zoom beneath it, and the ultralisk, despite being bigger, attempts to crush its way through.  As it starts making progress, Edna jams the throttle on the jeep, while cletus picks the back end up with the firebat suit to aim it.\n\nThey let it go, and as the jeep hit it in the face, everything went off. A giant handful of dice, several hundred damage, and the group thinks they've done it- the thing is killed! Except it wasn't. As the smoke cleared, it roared and began struggling again. Despair filled the players.\n\nAnd then the hospital collapsed on it.\n\nThey lived!\nTo be continued...",

        "text": "This is my first time posting here and my second game of a Homebrew DnD, and DnD in general, therefore my apologies in advance about formatting and any other mistakes I may make. Please note that the DM plays loosely with what can and can't happen.\n\n\nA factoid that will be helpful later is that foresight is a house rule skill that basically helps the player come up with plans in dire situations, like if the group was fighting a lich they could roll foresight to get hints on how to fight him. Iif you score high you would get a plan on how to fight him and have a somewhat decent chance at working. But if you roll low you become convinced a bad idea is precisely how you would defeat an enemy and cannot be swayed against the plan for several turns.\n\nThe world setting is apocalyptic future Sci-Fi with magic because our DM couldn't decide between the three. Think Fallout for the technology and the opposite of water world (Nothing but desert) for the environment.\n\nThis was a solo session between the DM and I since the rest of the group took this session off or couldn't make it and we were bored. So we had the session be a prelude to the first session we had last week because we couldn't just go into the second session without them. It was also to build my characters background since all there was to him was that he was a chaotic neutral bounty hunter with four single-cartridge laser pistols and a 30ft nonlethal laser rope.\n\nMy character was min/maxed to be good/great at three things: Being persuasive, Engineering/Building stuff (they derive from same stat), and shooting/throwing things. Basically a sky pirate since every airship was an actual ship fitted to fly. Think Treasure Planet ships but with cruise ship amounts of levels beneath the deck.\n\nI asked the DM to make the start interesting, He said ok and let a d100 decide how well of a situation I started in. I rolled a natural 1. I started 70,000 feet in the sky after being shot out of a canon from a nearby flying circus. Essentially the circus was trying to show off their cannons and aimed at a second ship with a pad designed for this and missed.\n\nThe DM asks what I do. I tell him I use perception. He tells me I spot a cloud. Great. I roll foresight: 4. I become wholeheartedly convinced that If I take my laser rope can be used as a propeller to slow my fall. With nothing to lose I do just that and fall to 40,000 feet before I can start swirling the rope around my head like an idiot. He asks me to roll because DM reasons. I roll a 1.\n\nHe says that I remember that for any flying animal the wingspan has to be at least 1.5 times the length of the animal from head to toe. I extend my rope out further. Suddenly at 30,000 feet my laser rope gets caught in the engine turbine of a passing sky pirate ship and I lose my grip on the rope. I am then launched through the side of the ship into the cargo bay with a broken arm and leg. I roll perception to see what I can find in the cargo bay to see what can help me in my situation.\n\nNatural 20. I find a medical bot that repairs my arm and leg. I then proceed to try and loot the cargo bay before anyone can find me. I roll a 15 and he says I find an armed low yield nuclear warhead. He claimed that it was there due to rolling a 1 on the starting situation. I roll to disarm the nuke and with my engineering being high (most tech in game runs off a similar base system) I disarm it. I put it in my bag for later since it's roughly the size of a large purse.\n\nDM says I suddenly hear people shouting and rushing towards the cargo bay and asks what I do. I do the only thing any sane person would and hide. I do this by building a low quality metal cactus that I can fit inside of. The DM sighs and says roll, I get a 5. The cactus is horrible quality and wouldn't fool anyone, so I move into a shadowed corner. \n\nThe pirates walk down and notice that not only is there a giant hole in the ship but there is suddenly a cactus in the corner. I yell at them \"I AM A CACTUS\" trying to persuade them. I roll 15 and they roll 2, 5, and 1 respectively. They firmly believe that I'm a normal cactus and am in no way or form unusual. They leave to inform the captain that something blew a hole in the side of the ship. I follow them while disguised as a 'cactus'.\n\nOnce we reach the top deck the other crew start to think I'm not actually a cactus, so I quickly run over to the captain who is steering the ship. He notices the blatantly obvious green cylinder with pieces of metal sticking out of it is rushing at him and thinks that it is not a cactus. In the middle of telling his first mate to attack I scream \"I AM NOT A CACTUS\". Now why I said that I will never know, but the DM didn't even bother having me roll because the outcome will be the same either way. So instead I yell \"LOOK OUT THERE'S A.... A... Uh... BIRD?\" and jump over the railing to hide. They fall for it being some of the most incompetent crew in the history of time. I then leave my 'cactus' disguise and jump over the railing and hold on for dear life.\n\nAfter destroying the 'cactus' the captain and crew return to their duties. I roll to eavesdrop and get a nat 20. The DM clearly sighs and informs me of the captains outrage of mixing up the location of the parachutes and the robot doctor, telling me there are many parachutes in the med bay.\n\nThis was probably a small hint that I should get a chute and just bail. Instead I stealthily took out the captain (and took his bandolier), his first mate and two bandits on the cannons behind them before being caught by the four others on the deck. Wait a second.... four bandits.... four pistols.... four shots.\n\nI tell the DM I dodge the first bullet they fire and try to pull out my gun and shoot one bandit old west style. Rolled a 5, great. I accidentally over dodged and dropped my pistol, causing it to fly across the deck. Next plan of action Is to pull out two pistols and shoot the two bandits with guns. I succeed but there are still two other bandits and I only have one gun left. I throw the guns at the bandits, distracting them, pull out my remaining pistol and shoot one before throwing that pistol, then a knife, at the last remaining bandit. I missed with the knife but hit him in the face with a pistol. So I do what anyone would. I run up and punch him in the face.\n\nNatural 1. I caress his ear and he is visibly uncomfortable DM asks me what I do. I lose all ability to care, and while still caressing his ear, I whisper to the bandit \"I am the captain now, join me Pinocchio.\" Natural 20, he has a heart attack and dies. Better than expected.\n\nI then rearm myself and try to push my luck by telling the entire crew that I not only just usurped their captain, but exactly where I am and challenge them to fight me if they have any complaints. I then sit on the deck with two pistols raised staring at what I thought was the only door to the deck. Turns out there were four other doors and I'm now surrounded.\n\nSince I'll probably be taken prisoner I shout at them \"Beware foul pirates, you have just provided me with the opportunity to attack in every direction.\". They take none of my nonsense and a seven foot two gargantuan not only rips a mounted cannon off the side but then tries to shoot my feet with it. I roll out of the way just in time only to notice the crew draw their swords and guns to fight over who was now the captain. I noped out and jumped into the newly induced cannon ball hole to fall about ten feet before landing into nice soft parachutes.\n\nThis was obviously the DM trying to tell me to leave, so I did what any sane man would. I sabotage all of the parachutes while the bandits fight over who's boss. The DM sighs and lets me. I find a map on the wall and notice I am right next to the engine room, so I sneak in and try to fake crash the ship, hoping the bandits would stop fighting soon and check the engine statues only to notice and try to jump ship before they realized they actually weren't crashing. Instead I find my laser rope and end up causing a SOS emergency signal to all ships within a 30 mile radius.\n\nThe DM decides this is a perfect time for another ship to appear and start blasting this one to bits. I run to the deck and get tailed by three bandits. I shoot two and throw a knife at the third. By some miracle it works and I get the bridge to my lonesome before the DM informs me that a cannonball flies right by my head. \n\nI hail the other ship and hope it's not just other sky pirates hoping to get an easy score. Thankfully it was actually pirate hunters. I lie to them saying this is my ship and pirates took over and blah blah blah. This is when I come up with an ingenious idea. I convince the other ship to broadcast that they will blow this ship out of the sky in 30 seconds, but will spare any who leave before the ship goes down. The pirates are very concerned but they all decide living is the better part of valor, so they get themselves the parachutes from med bay and bail. Problem with that plan is that the parachutes are now defective and the ship is still 30,000 feet up. They plummet to their deaths. Whoops, did I do that?\n\nThe pirate hunters thank me for being cooperative about the whole situation and not trying to sue them to get repairs. I tell them if anyone asks I'll blame the pirates.\n\nThat friends is the story of how I got my own pirate ship. Constructive criticism is always welcome and apologies in advance about any errors I have missed.\n\nIf you guys want more there are several exploits that follow after this such as:\n-Nuking a circus\n-Briefly becoming a king\nand\n-Helping a revolution\n\nEdit: Minor spelling errors",

        "text": " Some of my favorite stories from video games come from Eve Online, a game which is primarily economy focused but sometimes explodes into real conflicts. I tried to write in the same style of these epic tales, in a way that even someone from /r/all can understand. This is a copypaste from a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/3hqun1/an_extensive_recap_of_the_voc_knowledge_bomb/) I just made on /r/pathofexile, but I figured you guys would enjoy it too. Recently, a [knowledge bomb](https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/3hp9qz/voc_tells_the_rest_of_the_story_on_those_72/) just got dropped about some mysterious recent occurrences in the game's economy which has shaken the system to its very core. \n\nSo user from /r/all, how does this game's economy work? Path of Exile is somewhat unique in the fact that its currency is essentially based around widgets. What does this mean? I'll explain: \n\n(/r/pathofexile users, skip below to \"Now to the intrigue\" section if you already understand the mechanics of the game/trade system)\n\nVarious things have value in Path of Exile, and here's a list: \n\n* **Gear** the stuff you wear, like gloves, helmets, body armour, etc\n\n* **Maps** these are the \"end game content\", i.e. the things that you use to enable you to \"play the game\" after you've \"beaten the final boss\" as you usually don't need to be the maximum level to beat the game. Better, more difficult maps let you continue your adventures, keep leveling, and keep challenging your character\n\n* **Skill Gems** these are the objects that grant you abilities. Basically, the spells that your character casts. These are less important to the story as you can now buy them from non-player vendors cheaply\n\n* **Jewels** different than skill gems, these allow you to alter your character's base stats: giving you more damage, health, etc\n\n* **Currency** These are the widgets. When I say currency, I don't mean stuff like dollars, gold, silver, copper or anything else that's usually regarded as substitutes for \"value\". These widgets (usually in the form of \"Orbs\" but sometimes have other base names) only have value relative to each other, how useful their function is, and how rare they are to acquire. \n\n**How the Game and more specifically its Currency Works** \n\nBefore we get into what's been going on with Path of Exile's Economy, though, you have to understand something further about how the game works. All of the things listed above, you can acquire them in different ways but the primary way you get anything -- Gear, Jewels, Currency etc. -- is you kill a monster, and it drops something. \n\nEverything that drops has a tier of rarity assigned to it, and everything that drops has a random set of stats associated with it (Aside from the rarest tier, Uniques, which always have the same set of stats -- hence the name), and every stat also has a tier of levels it can fall into, which is then finally randomly rolled for its final value. The higher the rarity of an item, the more of these random sets of stats can appear on it, up to a maximum of 6 stats, 3 \"prefixes\" and 3 \"suffixes\" which are exclusive sets of stats to each other. What I'm trying to get at here is that the chance of getting a piece of Gear, Jewel, or Map with a good set of stats, which are all the maximum value, is extremely extremely rare and almost never happens. This is where Currency (or Orbs) comes in. \n\nEvery piece of currency acts as a widget, that does some sort of work on an Item (Gear, Maps, Jewels). Every piece of currency also has its own tier of rarity, ranging from Alteration Orbs which you can generate fairly quickly (say, 1-5 every 10 minutes killing monsters) to the Mirror of Kalandra which appears in the wild of the game so rarely that every instance of its existence is often announced to every other player through gloating in the general chat. Owning a Mirror of Kalandra is a sign of extreme luck, or extreme wealth in this game. This will be important later on.\n\nThus, each piece of currency has value relative to its function, its rarity, and relative to each other based on how much of one widget type another player is willing to exchange for another widget type. The way things have shaken out, players have organically decided that the somewhat rare \"Chaos Orbs\" tend to be the currency exchanged and used to value mid-range items and lower rarity currency, while the much rarer \"Exalted Orbs\" are generally used to buy and sell the \"best\" items. People will generally generate Chaos Orbs on their own, and once they have enough will buy Exalted Orbs with their Chaos stash whenever they want to buy a big-ticket Item. Generally when new leagues start (the game has cyclical Temporary Leagues), it takes some time for the fluidity of the exchange rate between these two Orbs to settle into something consistent, but there will always be some sort of of variability in how many Chaos will buy you an Exalted Orb. \n\n **Now, to the Intrigue**\n\nLately, some strange things began to happen in the Temporary Leagues. First, the Chaos:Exalted trade ratio began to inflate rapidly. What was usually a ratio somewhere around 35-38:1, quickly climbed to 70-80:1. This meant one of two things: either Chaos Orbs were being produced by the community far quicker (and accelerating, as well) than ever before, or Exalted Orbs were disappearing, and rapidly. As it turned out, it was the latter. \n\nSecond, a group of players began to start gloating in General Chat that they had acquired (legitimately) 72 Mirrors of Kalandra. In layman's terms, that's like someone posting on Twitter that in just a few months they had become a Trillionaire. Note: I do not actually know the precise rarity of Mirrors, however if finding one is the equivalent of winning the lottery, this is the equivalent of winning the lottery 72 times. Or more specifically, making money equivalent to winning the lottery 72 times. \n\nNow this group was known for being extremely rich to begin with: they were master crafters: people who generated a nice pool of Currency to invest into making items using in-game mechanics to then sell at a profit. But even for them, 72 Mirrors was absolutely ridiculous. Ridiculous to the point that they were accused of hacking or buying the Mirrors with real-world currency. They decided they had to set the record straight.\n\nThis group, after making their game-breaking nest egg, responded with a reddit post explaining how they made their money: they had discovered a new way to craft extremely expensive items using an undiscovered change to a mechanic released with the recent expansion to the game. This mechanic (which consumed Exalted Orbs, revealing the cause behind the massive inflation) had actually been proven to not work prior to the expansion: and had been forgotten about. By keeping this secret amongst themselves, they claimed they were able to game the economy for all this time, generating their wealth and secretly causing the inflation. This is one of the reasons I, and many others enjoy this game: there are many shortcuts that GGG (the company that makes it) implements in the game without telling anyone, leaving them to be discovered (and exploited) by the lucky few who do. This group discovered a shortcut which didn't work before suddenly did, and made their fortune from it. Then they shared the secret to their wealth with the community. \n\n**Or did they?**\n\nToday, shit hit the fan. Another player (VOC) who was aware of what this group was doing recently [called them](https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/3hp9qz/voc_tells_the_rest_of_the_story_on_those_72/) out for misleading the community with their \"coming out\" post. He claimed, with evidence, that there was more that they were hiding, more to the methods of creating the 72 Mirrors of wealth they were sitting on. This group absolutely did produce some of their wealth with the method they showed the community, but VOC showed how they had used an even cheaper, also overlooked way to create even more ridiculous items via crafting -- a method they decided to keep to themselves presumably to continue building wealth after devaluing the method they \"came out\" with by revealing it to the community. Furthermore, VOC claims their wealth came not only from withholding information about this second crafting method, but also from Meta-gaming the entire Path of Exile trading system maliciously.\n\n**The Path of Exile Trading System**\n\nWhat makes Path of Exile, a spiritual successor to Diablo II, fundamentally different from other ARPGs, besides the Currency system? Its blatant lack of an Auction House. In Path of Exile, the only way to find an item with the stats you want on it, locate the player with the item, and exchange your currency for their item, is to message them in game and set up a trade directly with them. \n\nThis is a major headache to deal with, but a stated pillar of GGG's design philosophy. To help make the process easier, they made the code of their game (the API) as well as the forums of the game's website (where people post items for sale) open-sourced (I think) or at least easily searchable for players wishing to make third-party apps to support the system. Players from the community have taken this access and created third-party apps and websites which essentially function as a stand-alone Auction House. This website (poe.trade) is used by the majority of the community wishing to purchase and sell good gear for currency, and trawls the forums and game 5-6 times and hour to aggregate all of the items players currently wish to sell. The creator of poe.trade also made his site's code open-source, so that players could create their own versions of it if they so wished. This is important. \n\n**Malicious(?) Abuse of the Trading System, or *Caveat Venditor* in Action**\n\nVOC continued with his expose on a Twitch stream explaining how this group had created a secret version of the poe.trade item trawler to scan the entire game and forums much more rapidly than poe.trade can. While if you increase the rate at which items are aggregated, it will slow down the ability of the trawler to display the results -- if you were looking for something in particular, perhaps only a few specific items, you could snatch results faster poe.trade and get your foot in the door with prospective sellers before anyone on poe.trade even knew something was going to be listed. VOC even claims that recent issues with poe.trade was caused by this group testing their system, poe.trade occasionally not working properly or even going down was due to their private shenanigans. High-frequency trading, now in Video Game form. \n\nWhat's malicious about this exactly? An immense amount of players play Path of Exile, every day a new player picks up the game, starts killing monsters, and learns about poe.trade. This group, as alleged by VOC, used their high-frequency trawler to report to them whenever a new Mirror was discovered, talked about, or listed anywhere in the realm of the Path of Exile game and its forums. As soon as a new Mirror came into existence, they would message the player who found it, and cross their fingers that it was a player who didn't know its real value, and low-ball them with Items or other currency for the Mirror: which the newbie would gladly accept, not knowing its true value. Through clever Meta-Gaming of a third-party system, they had basically guaranteed that they were always the first and only bid to the game's most valuable items, and laughed all the way to the bank with it. \n\nHope you enjoyed the story :)",

        "text": "I had my first session of the Rock and Roll campaign today (first time DMing in a few years, at least in person). \n\nThe band was reunited with their old singer, the halfling Rogue John Bluesky (pronounced Blue-ski), after he got out of jail. There was a dispute about him being replaced by the Storm cleric Madiun and his adopted brother Clyde (AKA \"Asterius the Cyberdemon\") not picking him up from prison. So some good roleplaying.\n\nThe band went to the bar for an open-mic night and for most of the night argued over what to name their band, what kind of band to be, etc. etc. Eventually another band came in and rocked the audience (all 13 of them), causing the band to get jealous of their attention. What did they do?\n\nJohn Bluesky loosened the mic-stand, loosened a floorboard and pissed in the drummer's beer bottle. The Tiefling warlock guitarist, Cyrus, silently put a hex on the guitarist. The elf barbarian drummer, Laser Wolf, threw a chair but only got scolded by a less than thrilled surly waitress. \n\nThe guitarist started to hit on the wizard in all of his androgynous glory, and was seduced to the backstage. Asterius quickly used a glass bottle as a club and gave him a concussion. \n\nMeanwhile the singer got on stage, fell through the floor, grabbed onto the mic-stand, the mic-stand shrank down and he bashed his head into the floor. So the opposing band, Chrome, got injured and couldn't continue their set. This left our nameless protagonists quite happy as they trotted onto the stage to preform themselves.\n\nUnfortunately they rolled pretty poorly (except the wizard. He rolled marvelously). So the band's sound was all over the place and not doing well to pick up the spirits of the crowd. They sourly left the stage. \n\nChrome gestured them to come over, telling them that they believed the band to have potential and that they would do well to go to the nearby Battle of the Bands. The protagonists felt like heels for sabotaging this new band, especially ones that were so nice to them. \n\nThe band decided to go and practice for a week, get a name and go to the battle of the band; thus starting their adventure.\n\nBut first they decided to go to the homeopathic healer's for some 'herb'. All except Laser Wolf (his parents ran the place and he had no wish to see them). The wizard dazzled the shopkeep/dad as the others explored the house. There in plain sight was a magic item I made just for them that could help! \n\n...Unfortunately they were too kind to want to steal, so they left it there, opting to eat pot brownies and stare at a banana magnet for an hour. It was okay, though, the banana magnet morphed into John, then a woman who betrayed him, and then his mother. Good times!\n\nMeanwhile Laser Wolf went home and threw cinderblocks out his window in rage (he felt the very fabric of reality shake when his parents mentioned his real name). He wound up in the landlady's room, with a magic item and a journal that could expose some great mysteries and fun stuff later down the road...But they were untouched. \n\nI had a feeling the little secrets I'd put in would be untouched. I'm well aware of how players never go the way you hope. Part of the charm.\n\nNothing incredible happened but this is an interesting way for a Rock'n'Roll campaign to start I guess!",

Freya and Perry have Tekex and the journal holed up in the tower, having been pried for information. Having discussed it, the princess and the fae child decided that it’d be best to investigate one of the other mining pits, hoping to steal the darkstone buried there to further complicate the goblin’s plans.\n\n&gt; The Cast of Characters includes:  \n&gt; Lindsey as *Perdenzia, the Fae Foundling*  \n&gt; DJ as *Arrow, the Would-be Knight*  \n&gt; Caitlin as *Freya Pendragon Kirkwall, the Forgotten Noble Child*  \n\nAs the duo tracks through the woods towards their location, they discuss what needs to be done. Hopefully the theft of the darkstone will upset the balance involved in the magnified cast darkness spell. Before long, Freya hears the sounds of motion in the brush. Perry turns her ear and hears goblin voices chattering about their ‘epic’ ambush for the humans. With the knowledge in hand, the two girls sneak around and surprise the goblin. With a mighty shout Freya charges, cutting one goblin down instantly. Perry comes in right behind her, swinging with her sword, but slices a tree instead. The goblins shriek in panic, and in anger that their plan is ruined, and charge the intruders. Both Freya and Perry find themselves at the wrong end of the goblin blades, nicking and slicing their clothing and flesh.\n\nTaking a few steps back, Perry hustles to pull her bow out, notching and arrow and sending it right into the chest of an unlucky goblin, who staggers and falls dead. The last goblin sees the writing on the wall, and starts to flee. Freya produced her dagger, and tossed it at the fleeing figure. She struck him in the ankle, causing him to trip down a hill. Both could hear his cries of anguish coming up from below. Perry slid down to investigate, and found the goblin with both legs broken, lying against a tree. His cries for help were loud indeed, and the fae spotted four more goblins rushing over to help their friend. Biting her lip, she unsheathed her dagger and deftly sliced the wounded goblin’s throat, killing him. But something inside her seemed to snap, and she stared down at the blood in confusion and sadness. This moment of hesitation was enough for the reinforcements to spot her. She quickly clambered up the hill and past the confused Freya.\n\nWith quickness like a cat Perry threw herself at a tree, clawing herself upwards to hide. Freya leapt towards a large hollwoed log, hoping to fit snugly inside. Unfortunately for the both of them, the goblins were too quick. They caught the fae halfway up the tree, and the princess’s upper half stuck in a log. With swords drawn, they demanded the duo surrender to them. Feeling rather heroic, the both of them deny the offer and ready their blades.\n\nThey are not as capable as they’d admit though, and they find themselves quickly overwhelmed as the goblin blades slice and cut at their bodies. In desperation, Perry conjures up the fae magic that resides deep within her blood, casting the spell she read from Tekex’s tome that should cast her enemies to sleep. But the goblins seemed to overpower the magical act, and both females found themselves bleeding and gasping as their strength faded…\n\nWhen all seemed at its worst, a bright light cast down from above, and they found a second wind. Knowing that combat at this point was useless, the duo staggered deeper into the woods, spending hours to dodge goblins patrols. After all of this trail-blazing they finally appeared in Lundefeld, bloody and beleaguered. They returned to the tower and collapsed on their cots, wondering what they were going to do next...",

        "text": "So me and some friends were playing a type of free form game of our own design. Basically the DM would just roll whatever they thought appropriate for the situation and make most stuff up as they went along, like most freeform DND. However what makes our version different is that we use cards against humanity cards to generate random items and encounters. Whenever the DM feels like it they can just draw a bunch of cards(usually around 10) and use items/characters from them in the situation or as reward for players. This tends to add a certain unpredictability and insanity to the games and makes for a very fun time. \n\nSo in this particular game, I was DM and the plot was that the multiverse was being merged into one reality by the shamwow guy, who, tired of being a joke had struggled to attain ultimate power. At the start of the campaign I decided to give the group a staff capable of opening a portal to another universe, but since it was unreliable it didn't always lead to the place of your choosing. The group then introduced their characters. Of note we had zippidy doo, the Mage, garblesnook, a monk who worshipped punching things and the mysterious stranger, who was your typical brooding fantasy protagonist  with a dark and mysterious past. However, the mysterious stranger had a darker secret than the group suspected, because the mysterious stranger was in fact..... two goblins in a cloak standing on top of each other.  Now that we had established characters, i gave them one random item from cards against humanity, and this is where I made my critical error.  Most of the players for fairly amusing yet useless items, such as assless chaps or axe body spray. However the mysterious stranger got geese. I thought this would be a fairly harmless novelty item, but boy was I wrong. He immediately asked me \"is this a few geese or an unlimited supply that I can summon?\" I decided sure, he could have as many geese as he wanted, what harm could they do? \n\nSo we started playing, and my group decided, because they're a group of hopeless nerds, to try to travel to Hoenn via multiverse teleportation staff and try catching  themselves some Pokemon.  They rolled to open a portal and got a 1,  and since I needed somewhere truly awful to send them for such a failure, I had the staff transport the party to Gary Indiana, often described as the worst town in the United States \n\nWithin minutes they'd fallen in with a gang of rednecks and launched a scheme to rob the cartel drug-lords at the other end of town.  They rocked up to the heavily fortified drug den/large house with a foolproof plan. The stranger and the Mage would create a distraction up front while mister McPunchmonk would climb onto the roof, punch through the ceiling then punch his way into the safe at the centre of the house. After he had the meth and a hefty bag of cash he would proceed to punch his way out again and rendezvous with the rest of the party and their redneck backup before escaping in their pickup trucks. \n\nThe first flaw in the plan became apparent when they opened they went to knock on the door and start a fight, hopefully drawing most of the thugs away from the safe. You see, while magic and swords are extremely useful and can be very dangerous when wielded in the right hands, so too can AK-47 assault rifles, which is exactly what was staring them in the face upon opening the door. They had a few seconds to think of something before they would be riddled with billets, and so the mysterious stranger raised his four arms high and bellowed \"I summon a meat shield of geese\". At the same time the Mage said \"I spray axe body spray in the eyes of the gangsters to distract them\".  Chaos immediately erupted as geese started hurtling out of a portal directly in front of the cattle thugs, and axe body spray and bullets filled the air. \n\nThe party retreated from the chaotic frenzy of geese and extremely irate thugs to assess the situation. The Mage then decided the best course of action would be to clear a path inside. So he attempted to launch a fireball into the frenzy, killing the gangsters and clearing a way inside. He rolled to succeed and got a natural twenty! A huge blast of fire engulfed the front of the house, igniting the axe body spray and setting fire to the frenzied pack of geese. Very rapidly a large, ever growing vortex of flaming geese engulfed the house, and started running rampage through Gary Indiana. The gigantic flaming geese inferno consumed the town in a matter of minutes, and went on to devastate the United States, killing millions before the source of the geese could be located and blocked off. Still at least they got a bag of meth and a few bucks out of it.\n",

        "text": "Also known as The story of Greg Tomlinson AKA Greg Son of Tomlin AKA LoneWolf.\n\nI thought I'd post this story because I'm about \"reboot\" the campaign I was once a player in. This my story but in a lot of ways it was also that GMs. The GM at the time had spent about 12 years in the armed forces(1995 - 2007); most of it overseas doing a lot of computer and information networking. This game kicked off in 2008 and this story took place in 2009 right before I left the group for university.\n\nThe theme of the campaign is the Old Gods(AKA real gods) were running a sort of tournament/gauntlet to distinguish who amoung the young gods(Barely having broken from their physical) forms. Were fit to lead from their pantheon.\n\nThe god I served was not actually supposed to be there. He was actually a very very young boy who had been given divine power by an young god who couldn't handle the idea of a 12 year old boy dying in agony of cancer in 11th century but didn't have the authority to perform miracles. His name was Cuthbert.\n\nMy character was Greg, a man from the modern ages who yanked back by the origional god to help protect Cuthbert. As the god could save Cuthbert but not prevent him from being yanked into the tournament. Enter Greg. In his world he was an army ranger crossed with a CIA spook. Greg was the type of guy that would spend years at war, be back on leave for five hours before starting a bar fight, going to jail for the night and then disappearing off to an oil rig until The Company found him again. It was often said Greg was chosen because no one noticed a god had disappeared him. Greg was actually chosen for his Good heart and PTSD/\n\nI'll only really detail two rules before telling the story.\n\n1: A deity in the tournament could only perform miracle in territory under their or their worshiper's direct control. Cuthbert controlled a small hospital in the prime material plane and a small private plane of existence(most gods had one of these).\n\n2: Getting in and out of private plane was either really easy or hard depending on how hard the god was trying to keep you there, but there was no favouritism. Either is was easy for everyone or impossible for everyone.\n\nWe had been gaming for about a year and everyone else's god/character had been making their way mainly by aggressively taking land and winning the month long(in game) challenges. Cuthbert and Greg were by far less powerful but remaining in the race mainly because Greg was the most pragmatic person could be and still maintain a good alignment. It didn't hurt that the other players often refused to harm each other and the NPC young gods were a bit less focused on victory than they maybe would have been if controlled by players.\n\nThe start of the story is Greg was drinking in a tavern. The glass was actually filled with water and he knew some other gods men had been following him all week. It would have been Christmas back \"home\" when these guys started on him, and today New Years Eve. \n\nSuddenly the masked sound of the real gods came through clearly in his head. \"Starting immediately, and for the next month, any devotees and divinity lost will no longer be returned to the gods they 'belong' to.\"\n\nThis.Was.Huge.\n\nNormally when a character died their soul and 80% of their worth was returned to the god, who usually would spend the missing 20% of point and resurrect the character. This meant we had often been fighting and killing the same 20 NPCs for a year and they all belonged to the same 3-5 gods(It was often hard to tell who was pulling what strings).\n\nGreg pulls his hood up(A beyond maxed out cloak of elven kind) and straight up runs out of the bar. Some how the people following him knew of this challenge and wanted him out first. As the only combat ready follower of Cuthbert, if he died, Cuthbert was dead in the water.\n\nGreg reached the hospital right after midnight. Everyone was frozen, in stasis. Combining patients Cuthbert had been subtly healing and nurses that were working on their first character level, maybe 30 in all statues. After this story we found out the Gods had \"forgotten\" to mention this challenge was taking place in a nonexistent \"13th month.\"\n\n\"Home Office, this is LoneWolf, I need evac...NOW.\" \n\nLike missing a step on the stairs Greg felt himself leave the hospital and enter the small private plane that was about 70% tinkering projects whose technology was beyond the dark age setting and 30% what you would use to comfort someone who was having the heal a wound that should have killed him. Greg often thought of this place as home and felt guilty when it wasn't tidy or if he hadn't visited it recently.\n\nGreg: So what are you hearing on God Radio?\nCuthbert: Nothing. Everyone claims they are just going to lock down and wait out this challenge. Let one of the future gods of war have it. \n\nGreg knew it was going to be a bloodbath and the cost was too rich for most gods. But also there was no way certain gods were going to just let everyone stay out of it.\n\nDay one was when a, proclaiming to be The, God of Slaughter figured out people in statis have no extra protection from assault. THAT baited on of the players out because was much as Cuthbert loved healing children, her goddess was about protecting the helpless...usually until the goddess had trained and armed them and set them loose on their tormentors.\n\nGreg left the protection of the plane and returned to the hospital, but for the first time he brought all his modern weaponry with him. This was chance to scare off every bully and maybe buy some time for Cuthbert to grow up, maybe train some others. It was unrealistic for him to be the only champion of a potential future god.\n\nBy Day 6 the number of gods off the bench was total. Most cities were a mixture of building frozen right before collapse and still fires in the middle of forests. Undisturbed casualties on the floor.\n\nBy Day 16 Greg had run out of modern weaponry and was back to sword, board and fleet of feet. This was right when the more enthusiastic gods had started dropping their best fighters right on the border of whatever they controlled and pushed 24/7. Several of the gods that were barely hanging on were out of the fight forever. Cuthbert's blessing was that Greg had been a \"bad trade\" for the last 15 days and any attempt to storm the hospital had been met with trip mines and claymores about a block away from it. Debris filled the air for hundreds of feet above making an aerial strike unfun, but also the last large enemy that tried to come down from the skies has the full power of the 21st century assault rifle and a modern soldier emptied into it.\n\nBut now on day 16 he was too annoying for short tempered gods to let be. After taking the  brunt force of Brawn's(On of the quicker tempered Gods) real forces and winning; A magnificently injured Greg had moved all the patients and and nurses into the private plane, retreated there himself. He had made a mess doing so but hopefully anyone who didn't know would assume the streaks and lines and puddles of blood everywhere had come from multiple people and that the hospital had been a slaughter.\n\nDay 20 and most of Greg's organs regrown later what little peace they had was being interrupted. The first 15 days of battle had earned Cuthbert some extra power but now much bigger gods were knocking on the planes door and wanted in.\n\nGreg and Cuthbert fortified the place where everyone was being stored and had called up all of their allies AKA the other players to come help. Used a not so small favour they were owed to keep maybe one or two of the scavengers away. This was plain and simple everything Greg's small god had in him.\n\nLike a bubble burst all the enemies came in, some had unfortunately been cursed with coming through a mile or so up, so a small number of enemies went splat but not enough. Greg and the allies were using whatever wide burst damage they had to narrow the battle from armies pouring against them to just stronger than them champions of other gods. \n\nGetting it down to just the champions had cost Greg his workshop and set him back a year's worth of making gunpowder the hard way(The explosion had been fun to see but it was something I as player was saving for later), another player's champion had to pull out(they(The character, God and player) were here out of obligation and obligation isn't enough to march a soldier up the hill on D Day), and another player was about to cut out too because this battle after three hours real time in the middle of what was a 12 hour game was not going in our favour.\n\nSo as a player and Greg as a character had come to one resolute plan, we needed to give everyone an excuse to leave before they ran at bad times. \n\nGreg: Cuthbert, filter through to the friendlies that we need all the noncombatants taken out of here. And taken far far away.\n\nCuthbert: I...I think they'll do that. but if we let them out more enemies will be able to come through.\n\nGreg: That's fine.\n\n\nThe characters and players ran like anyone would have. This was clearly unwinnable and this battlefield was small. A lot of the other players had poured point after point into making this huge worlds with continents and minable mountains and farms, etc. I had made the island of Manhattan. Featuring mainly several small warehouses, A 600sqft lab underground, and a hammock on a hill.\n\nI was, if nothing, an amazing book keeper but not one for having anything I couldn't easy keep on the paper.\n\nLetting the heros out had basically increased the number of enemies by a whole decimal point. Every weak god that couldn't punch through to get in was now gleefully coming in open door.\n\nMy note I passed to the GM only asked this \"Putting all of Cuthbert's points we've earned this game into planar control, where am I ranked amongst the gods here?\"\n\nHis reply \"The **real gods** that have snuck in are still miles above, but only one or two combatants of 30 or so young gods.\"\n\nGreg: Home Office, this is LoneWolf, are all noncombatants clear?\n\nCuthbert: Yes, last one was out awhile ago.\n\nGreg: Copy-Copy. Home Office; If you'd kindly Close, Lock, Bar and lean against the door.\n\n\nSo there was the image of a now maybe 13 year old boy, with the powers of a god hesitantly lock the door to his home, from the outside, with a bunch of screaming adults cursing at him from inside.\n\nGreg hid. Letting the armies trap there start to in fight as they could no longer find their real target. A couple hours later an assassin had found him, done no damage but had sent a very real  message.\n\nSoon more and more of the armies were finding him and the infighting had stopped.\n\nGreg became injured on day 22. The healing that usually benefited everyone in the plane had been shut off for obvious reasons, so Greg was actually bleeding to death.\n\nCuthbert: If I open the door someone can grab you.\n\nGreg(0HP): If you do that you'll be letting everyone here out for another 11 days of hell on earth. Keep it closed.\n\nCuthbert: What then, you die and I'm alone watching these things rip up the dirt?!\n\nSeveral minutes pass and Greg has crawled to cover but left a trail of blood and barely can keep awake long enough to keep himself from bleeding to death faster. For reference -16HP would be permanent death.\n\n\nGreg(-12HP): Home Office do you copy?\n\nCuthbert: You know I do.\n\nGreg(-13HP): Home Office, this is LoneWolf. Go for the kill.\n\n**Pass a note to the GM: Greg wants Cuthbert to collapse the plane on everyone here. Take out the armies all at once.**\n\nCuthert: I...I...I can't. You'll die. I'm not trading you for some win.\n\nGreg(-14HP): Home Office...Cuthbert. You can't save me but you can save literally everyone else. This was my home but right now it's war again.\n\nGreg(-15HP): Home Office, this is LoneWolf. Go for the kill.\n\nAnd he did.",

        "text": "So, this is a situation that occurred while I was playing Skyrim with a mate. It was his go, so I was just watching, but the most glorious thing ever came along that made it worthwhile to watch. \n\nBasically he heads to Dawnstar, to get the secret chest if I remember correctly. As he walks in the front(ish) door of the village, the battle music starts up, and we hear a Dragon roar. My friend audibly sighs, and looks up to try and spot the dragon. Until to find there isn't just one of them. There are three. \n\nAnd they're Legendary Dragons. Now, my friend isn't a pushover in this game, but three Legendary Dragons is kind of pushing his luck. By this point however, he's in this neck deep, and so he goes for it. All the guards, and numerous NPC's (who haven't dived for cover) pour out of Dawnstar, and set upon the Dragons. The Guards are dropping like flies, and yet they keep coming. The villagers are being slaughtered, but the invincible ones just keep getting back up and going for it again. \n\nAnd that's when the Mammoth's turn up. We're unsure where they came from, but the best guess we could make is that one of the Dragon's managed to aggro the Mammoths, and so they followed to Dawnstar. Turns out, the Giants tagged along. While the Mammoths alternated between trying to gore my friend, and the Dragons, the Giants set straight on him. \n\nHis game is seriously starting to freak out, the frames are dropping left right and center. Then, in an attempt to keep the Dragons grounded and make it somewhat easier, he used Dragonrend on the Dragons. \n\nUp in the top left of the screen, came a single message. \nSkeever resisted Dragon Rend. \n\nSomewhere in that Omni-fuck of a situation, was a Skeever. \n\nIt took upwards of half an hour to sort out the whole situation. We never found the Skeever.",

        "text": "Today we found a strange. I struggle for words. Man. It certainly identified as a 'male', and appears to be some sort of mimic human. He was wounded by the fall of the city, and we found him in a pile of debris created by the fall of the city. \n\nBefore he awoke, I had a moment to inspect him. Upon first sight, he appeared to be a normal man with some tattoos. But once looking closer, any amateur surgeon (Such as myself) could tell he wasn't a human. His skin had a manufactured feel and look to it. Like something trying to pass for human. The blue tattoos were actually some sort of electrical conduit. The man was something I had never seen. \n\nBefore I could inspect him further, he started to move, and I stepped back. He was still wearing armor, and had several weapons about him. He awoke, and asked us about an Elven woman named \"Indilmus\", and then a human woman named \"Christy\". He gave us details on them. Indilmus a woman who ran an inn we had never attended. \n\nChristy however was another matter. I asked the man why he seeked this woman, and he said he owed her a debt, something that cannot bode well. \n\nI informed the man that the woman he was looking for was in the business of flesh, generally that which is not obtained legally no less. She enslaved women and stocked brothels with them. When I informed him of this, he said he'd talk to her about it himself, and that was the matter settled for him.\n\nI asked the strange man his name, and he told me Satsujin. He asked me my name, and when I told him, he said he had read some of my books. I was pleased, finally some civilized people. \n\nHe made the rest of the journey with us to the local fort, as we were escorted by a guard by the name of Geoffrey. \n\nOn the walk to the fort, I noticed something most peculiar. The water that had just previously flowed through the farmland had stopped. The irrigation system wasn't working. I knew a little about it, and recognized arcane things when I saw them. The water elementals that kept the fountains working, and the canals flowing were gone. \n\nWhen we arrived at the castle, I picked up on multiple details. There were flame motifs everywhere, and massive fireplaces that ran between floors. Normally, I'd expect to see a fire burning from the base of the castle to the top, but there was nothing. We passed under two golems that looked to be nonfunctioning as well. \n\nWhen we arrived in a large dining hall, Geoffrey offered us food and drink and mentioned that it was strange that the fires were out. After a short conversation, he confirmed my theory. The magic in the castle wasn't working. I alluded to what I thought, but I kept mostly to myself. \n\nI believe that the magic in the world has fundamentally changed. Someway, somehow. Maybe someone has done a ritual, or summoned something into the world. Maybe a god was killed. I do not know yet, I will have to do research, and travel more to find out, but I believe I'm at the root of the problem. Now I must find the cause. \n\nAfter eating and drinking our fill, a large bull of a man entered the room and spoke quietly with our escort. Geoffrey asked us to leave the room, and told us where we could find beds. \n\nI was asleep before my head hit the pillow. \n\nI was woken by the sounds of voices, and the strange warrior Satsujin knocking on my door. He wasn't wearing his armor, but there was an argument in the dining hall. \n\nAfter donning my clothes, and taking my trusty cane in hand, I helped Satsujin put on his armor, in case we weren't about to make any friends. After rousing Spoor our unlikely band of travelers stepped into the dining hall to see Geoffrey and some guards arguing with the massive man we had seen earlier. His name was Thalmus. \n\nThalmus was attempting to use the power vacuum to seize power, and take control of the castle we were in. He said that Sindraza, the owner, wouldn't be able to stop them, citing the failing magic in the castle.\n\nI nodded to Spoor and Satsujin and pointed to the door. We quietly took one step before everyone stopped arguing and looked at us. \n\nThalmus pointed at us. \"What side do you take!\"\n\nWe looked at Geoffrey and each other. A power vacuum like this could lead to raiders on the farm land and cause problems for the area. But Geoffrey was outnumbered.\n\nThe decision was made easier when the fireplace exploded outward with arcane power, as a Half-Orc woman stepped out of it. She pointed at Thalmus and the two of them exchanged bitter words. \n\nI've noticed an increasing trend in the survival rates of men who side with the arcane power, so the decision was made on who we stood for. \n\nI will not go into detail on the fight, as men who didn't need to die that day did so. The Samurai and Geoffrey were a sight to behold, fighting like mad men. \n\nI was more concerned with Sindraza and her spell casting. She was still able to cast spells, but even while casting fire spells she seemed to have difficulty concentrating. She was either a great deceiver in having us believe that she was a deadly fire mage, or the magical change to the world was causing problems. I believe the latter. \n\nWhen the battle was concluded, we helped Geoffrey lick his wounds. He and Sindraza were the only survivors. When they left the room to gather supplies for us, I quickly searched what was left of Thalmuses' body, and found a journal. I deposited it in one of my coat pockets before they returned.\n\nIn my experience, I've found men like him are rarely the head of an operation.  \n\nWe were gifted several potions, and offered coin for work, to help staff the fort. We politely declined the offer, and left the fort, not wishing to remain any longer. When we exited, we found the road, and stuck to it, walking south. \n\nQuickly we spotted smoke of the horizon, and found a burned cottage that was structurally sound enough to offer cover for the night. There was a battle here, and I suspect that there will be a fair bit of bandits on the road to Velsaport. \n\nTonight we shelter here, and tomorrow we journey again to help our warrior ally find this woman he seeks.

        "text": "\nSo today's game got off to a rocky start. The head of caravan has instructed the group to go on a stealthy quest to get some Intel on a target (I got there late) and when I came in they were trying to decide between a forest of cacti or an easier route beside a river. So we're walking along ANNDD...\n\nDM-random encounter. \n\nDM rolls and his eyes get real big.\n\nDM-I'm going to reroll that.\n\nRyan the Gunslinger- No no what was it?\n\nDM- it was kinda out of your parties league.\n\nGarrus the fighter- what? It's not like it was a dragon or...\n\nDM- actually it was.\n\nGroup then spent the next ten minutes figuring out how we would kill this young blue dragon. Some of the best ideas were \"give the Druids bear a \"Roofy Enima\" and when the dragons eats it and falls asleep have the monk break its neck\" and \"strap the fighters oil to the monk and fill the oil jugs with gun powder and then when it eats him he detonated the oil and explodes the dragon.\" The DM then decided we were all terrible people and rolled a new encounter\n\nDM-Roll for perception\n\nWe all roll pretty good.\n\nDM- a swarm of centipede are charging towards.\n\nPanda Jones (the Druid) and Garrus jump into the water to avoid bugs and Ryan and Brandon jump into the brush for cover. Brandon however trips (rolls a 1) and goes sprawling in the dirt.\n\nThis is when the centipedes enter his square (and possibly his circle ;) )\n\nHe spends two turns crawling painfully into the water while the centipede munch on him and the gunslinger sneaks his way into the water to avoid the same fate. So as they rumble off back into the desert we help fish the monk out of the water. The conversation in between these actions though bares mentioning.\nBrandon: ahhh! Their killing me!\n\nPanda Jones- come get in the water with Garrus and I!\n\nBrandon- As a black man that's like asking a moth to go get in the bug zapper!\n\nGunslinger- just pretend the centipedes are police officers. Lesser of two evils right?\n\nBrandon- well when you put it like that. \n\nSo we set out once again for...\n\nKELMARANE!\n\nYeah it's not that exciting. We spent an hour scouting and looking. In that time though we saw some gnolls lead a fat goat into a building and leave him inside the building. The bleeding heart Druid decides to see what these goats are being fed to so he and the monk go down to check. They find some really heavily armed gnolls.\n\nPanda Jones- we should see what's going on in there/\n\nBrandon- I don't like this. This seems like another example of a black man following a white man into a bad situation.\n\nThey stake out the meat house and wait (under the duress the monk wants made clear)\n\nAt this point Ryan and Garrus are preparing a controlled demolition. After deciding to cause a distraction they decided to burn down a likely looking building.\n\nPanda Jones- are you going to check for people? It could be an orphanage or something!\n\nBrandon- whose gonna care? Not their parents!\n\nAfter we stop laughing we set up our oil and torch clusterfuck and prepare to get back behind cover.\n\nDM- so roll one to see if you get away okay and then another for stealth\n\nGarrus- stealth? No sir, I'm gonna walk away.\n\nDM- what?\n\nGarrus- real men don't run away from explosions.\n\nDM- (put his head down) really?\n\nGarrus-yep.\n\nGarrus and Ryan escaped okay and make it back to cover before the gnolls start fighting the fire. Ryan and Garrus proceed to the closest building and run into a handsome black man praying at a grave. At this point Garrus has the brilliant idea to put his weapons away and approach this man in the spirit of friendship. As Garrus approaches him and Ryan holds his weapon in order to cap this guys if it starts going south Home boy turns and welcomes these two to his church. \n\nThat's about the time his face melts off and Garrus shits his scale male. Ryan initiate by going in hot and shoots him. Facemelts McGee then proceeds to rape Garrus in the mouth almost to death. Garrus invokes Sarenray and gains some hit points. Garrus hits a knee, light surrounds him, the catholic boys choir releases a long pent up tone, Garrus rises to his feet before this undead abomination...\n\nAnd the song X gone give it to ya queues up in the background as the lich drives five across his face and puts him on the ground.\n\nSarenray opts not to let him bleed to death but no further miracles were performed for Garrus that day. \n\nSo now that Garrus is in a state of unconsciousness Ryan begins to unload on this undead asshole. Undead asshole charges and takes Ryan to near death and in a fit of desperation he point blank shots him.\n\nRyan's bullet bursts up through this asshole (he crits) and the undead bitch bursts apart. \n\nMajor celebrations are had because we had not expected to live. Potions were handed out, lives were saved, Sarenray was thanked, and people were good once more. Garrus then dead eye starred the DM until he felt uncomfortable.\n\nGarrus- is there anything left of this creature?\n\nDM- yes...\n\nGarrus- I want to piss on him.\n\nDM- what?\n\nGarrus- I...WANT...TO  PISS ON HIM!\n\nDM- ...Okay\n\nAnd he did. And it was glorious!\n\nSo while this is going on our Druid and Monk (whom Garrus dubbed Bj and the bear) are trying to make their way to the fighter and the gunslinger. As their going they anger a large bore the gnolls are keeping for some reason who turns out to be crazy as shit.\n\nThe pig attacks and the monk crits him upside his head with both fists. This crit does not have the life saving effect it did for the Gunslinger though. The boar proceeds to maul the bear to death and take Panda Jones into the negatives. So both Brandon and Panda are begging their asses off as they hope for a miracle but the DM would not be swayed and the pig proceeds to maul them both to death. That's about where we decided to call it a night and roll some new characters for our now dead monk and Druid.\n\nJoin us next time for chapter 6- Gnoll Country \nI",

        "text": "So it was a 5e campaign, and we had a couple flake players and me as a regular with another. I was a dwarf bard of valor, they were a tengu thief. So we get to a point where the tengu thief needs to rob a temple for information, but we can't let it be known that the information was stolen so we just HAPPENED to need to rob the place blind as well.\n\nExcept the bard of valor was a bit of a folk hero and did his best to sell his soul for honor, glory, and a good story. He wasn't going to be a thief unless that thievery helped those who needed it. He talked up and down a wall about how all the money they were going to be taking would be going into the coffers of donations. The corrupt monastery would lose its vault, but the orphanages of vague and typical port city would do well for a very long time!\n\nThe rogue and the rogueish NPCs helping didn't QUITE understand, so they sold him down to a 'third' of the money taken by the Tengu himself would be given off to charity. Anything the NPCs took would be theirs, which made sense to me on an OOC level and the bard grumbled and just settled for it...\n\nNow moving onto the next session, I get ready to sit around and watch the rogue RP while me and the warlock (who the bard said quite adamantly that he should stop worshipping those 'faceless whores' that he keeps going on about). The DM slips something to us both and says for the duration of the session, since we wouldn't have much to do, we'd play the poisoner and the arcane trickster NPCs following the Tengu. He told us what our priorities were and said to have fun with it.\n\nSo I was an arcane trickster, previously the goodly bard, and I was the typical halfling or gnome whatever's going on there affair. I had an 'unquantifiable amount of rocks' in my pockets of holding for JUST the most hilarious purposes and my main spells were an illusion, color spray, and charm person.\n\nSo we get into the temple or whatever, and...\n\nBlind monks. Blind monks and clerics. We try to sneak past these high wisdom monstrosities, but every bit of our efforts on THAT front was wasted. The poisoner put one to sleep with a dart, and I just stared at this monk's blind, dumb, angry face as he ran at me with fists and sighed.\n\nY'know what? Charm person! I get disadvantage, the monk has a massive will save, but at least I can say I contributed- Dice roll- To the combat in some meaningless- Dice roll- Way.\n\nAnd he's charmed.\n\nMe and the other party members (and the DM) sit there for a moment to consider what this means... I was the first to talk.\n\n\"I'm so sorry for coming out of my room tonight,\" I say to the man, \"I'm just an acolyte who got lost. Could you lead me to the library? I was told to study, but I need an escort. It's sooo late...\"\n\n\"Also, I need your friend's holy symbol for it...\"\n\nAnd down the golden holy symbol goes into my pockets of holding.\n\n\"It's really important! It's all about divinity... Because we worship the sun- Or whatever. Don't you feel the same? I feel an inexplicable connection to be the best acolyte I can be. Don't you feel the same connection to just -help- me even though it doesn't make too much sense? It must be divine!\"\n\nSo we wander through the monastery, letting the monk talk his way through everything when possible and adding in my own words when not. Every statue we passed had a silver sword. 6 silver swords into my pockets of holding.\n\nWe get to the library, and a cleric is sitting in there. He gets into an argument with the monk...\n\nCharm person.\n\nDice roll...\n\nDice rolll. We're not even in combat, but I'm getting disadvantage? How dare you!\n\nCleric is charmed too. Golden covered books? I need those for my studies. Don't mind the fact that I'm stuffing them into my pockets. Hey, do you know where I can find this information? Oh, it's not important, and really, -really- it's not important that I'm looking through your desk, friend!\n\nIt comes time to move on from petty larceny, so we ask around if anyone knows anything about the information... Evidently it'd be in a private library upstairs behind walls.\n\nBut that there might be a secret passage, oh yay!\n\nBut we can't really walk through the halls with the clear intention to go up there with our new friends! Charm person might have done a lot, but it couldn't bend someone's will entirely! We needed to get rid of them...\n\n\"What's a dangerous drug in this setting? Something my character might know about that, y'know, just ruins lives.\" I ask my DM.\n\n\"What? Uhhh... Crack, I guess...\"\n\nLess than ten minutes later, a cleric and a monk break from charm person wondering why they're beating up a bunch of acolytes and searching their rooms for crack while a trio of thieves rides out of an upper story window clinging to a tengu's legs, the halfling's pockets stuffed with the pope's PJs and bed linens.\n\nThe pope's room was full of rocks when the sun rose.\n\nAnd since the tengu didn't get to steal ANYTHING, the orphans didn't get donations.",

        "text": "I have been running a D&amp;D campaign for the past two years with a group of people I like to call The Glorious Chucklefucks. It's now more accurate, however, to say that I ran a campaign with them, past tense; tonight, it came to an end. As is only fitting, they fucking cheesed that shit, and it was great.\n\nIn the past few sessions (which I have been too busy to post here but will in due time), the world has ended, leaving only about ten thousand mortal survivors, and all the former characters and party allies still living have returned to help the Chucklefucks stop Bazzracath the Bargain Demon from killing the gods and feeding their life force to the Outer God Yog Sothoth, ending the universe. I managed to get Heather, Liza, and Cornelius to return and reprise their roles for this session; my only regret is that Spencer had already moved into college and thus could not be with us.\n\nThe session begins with the party entering the palace of the gods and receiving the deities' blessings, which translated to a temporary ability to use spells without spell slots and replenish all HP every round. Against them, eleven Things Which Should Not Be, gibbering tentacled horrorterrors from beyond this reality. Cornelius, lovable odd bastard that he is, chooses to point out to them that, philosophically, they shouldn't exist, and rolls high enough to cause half of them to disappear. Noel and Friedrich unleash their full power and reduce those remaining to smears on the ground. Wasn't even close to a fucking fight. More hordes of Things approach, however, and soon after the initial engagement the Chucklefucks feel the blessings of the gods fade away. Three of the less plot important NPC allies stay behind to hold them off, while the Chucklefucks charge forward to gods' throne room. As they go, they see their memories take shape before them: five mercenaries, grouped together at random in an army of sellswords, join together in search of a stolen orb. They travel the world, plagued by an army of demons and a relentless cult, and as some of their people are lost others join their cause. Between worlds and back again, to the surface of a dead moon and far forward in time, the wanderers travel in search of adventure. Time and again they triumph over evil, until they are finally forced to shatter the world itself to save the broader universe. Now, after all their years together, all the adventures they shared, those people stand here, before one last locked door. Friedrich Eisenberg rolls to headbutt.\n\nHe succeeds.\n\nWithin is Bazzracath, the biggest asshole of the campaign, servant of an Outer God. He pulls a villain monologue, and reveals my grand Long Con, several months in the making: through some very convoluted shit which may be long enough to warrant its own Game Tale, Bazzracath possesses a command phrase which will wipe the personalities of Echo, Prometheus, Cassie, and Shamus and place them under his control. He does so, and the Chucklefucks are forced to slaughter their old friends. Prometheus stays alive, however, as Friedrich manages to take from him the King's Axe, a magical weapon which gives the wielder control over all dwarves, and orders him to fight on their side. Final battle with Bazzracath commences. Shit is getting ruined on both sides, then the Wabbajack gets busted out. An earthquake hits the chamber, forcing those in the party with the power to fly to do so and bring their allies with them, taking the battle to the air above a churning mass of crushing rock. Nathaniel uses the Wish spell to bring back the possessed party members, who had been unconscious and making death saves, and restore them to their former selves. He then ends as he began, firing off five Wabbajack shots simultaneously. \n\nThe end result is that Bazzracath is made of living gold, Nathaniel is healed somewhat, Bazzracath dominates Nathaniel's mind, Nathaniel gets 8 wishes, and an ally from the past returns to aid Nathaniel. The aid in this case, given that Bazzracath now controls him and his wishes, comes in the form of one of the NPCs who had been holding back the Things appearing and killing Nathaniel, sending his body to be crushed by the rocks below. Given the raw magic of creation swirling throughout the room, his soul immediately gets up and watches the battle as a ghost. Soon after he is joined by Patrick, who grapples and pins Bazzracath so that they both fall into the earthquake. The halfling dies, while the demon is severely wounded.\n\nNot long after that, the united Chucklefucks bring the demon down to zero HP. Broken and dying, he looks to Friedrich and says, \"I don't suppose I could offer you a deal?\" In response, Friedrich raises his blade (a Holy Avenger named Recht, which is the German word for justice) and says, \"Prepare to get Recht.\" He decapitates Bazzracath, then shoots his severed head with his gun. The asshole is dead, and the final battle is won.\n\nThe energy of the gods stands ready to pass into new hosts, and any with mortal souls are eligible. The Chucklefucks have to decide if they wish to give up their mortal lives and become gods. I'll cover each of their individual decisions and outcomes in the updated flowchart I will post soon, but of particular note is Friedrich. He and Shamus become gods, then fuse together with the God Emperor of Mankind. In my setting, gods derive power from the number of people who worship them. When they become one with the God Emperor, they are fueled by trillions upon trillions of worshipers. This new being, the Iron Lord, is everywhere and in every moment at once, the master of time and space. He smites all evil in the universe, and creates a utopia for the just and righteous. And in doing so, Wade achieved the ultimate cheese, the most cheesy cheese of all time, by becoming the most powerful being which has ever been, or ever will be.\n\nIt was a fitting end.",

We set up outside the death tyrant, set of vampires, an evil cleric, and a lich, knowing we'd be tpk'd if we charged in - but then our rogue dives in, and uncaps an \"Eversmoking Bottle\" we acquired earlier, and everyone had pretty much forgotten about. Immediately, everything in the room is filled by a heavy smoke... making everything heavily obscured, and hence all of the enemies (and us too) become effectively blind.\n\nGuess who didn't have blindsight or blindsense? Vampires, beholders, human clerics, or liches. Guess who does? Our rogue and druid-turned-earth elemental.\n\nNeedless to say, that fight didn't quite go as the DM wanted.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLike the title, other quotes:\n\n\"Wouldn't take so long if we didn't have so much damn smoke in the way\" (said as the DM glares at the rogue).\n\n\"I would ask how bad the Beholder looks, but I can't see shit right now.\"\n\n\"Come on, magic missile, you don't miss, don't you autohit?

        "text": "----------------------\n----------------------\n*One Year Prior*\n----------------------\n----------------------\n\nI've been having strange dreams I cannot place.  We have almost finished recovering what we can from that terrible raid, gathering what was left from the old Lord.  I daresay I've slipped into my new role as Seneschal like I've been doing it for years.  We can only go up from this point, but still.\n\nThese dreams.  These nightmares.\n\nMy Lord Klaus has noticed my distance on several occasions.  Every time he breeches the subject cautiously, beginning in the same way.\n\n\"There's something different about you Kaleb.  New haircut?  Glasses?\"\n\n\"No sir.\"  I meet with Klaus frequently to discuss the financial health of the ship.  He has been more attentive since the news is no longer as depressing as it stood when I first took the promotion, but he will still fail to concentrate and try to steer the conversation somewhere else. \n\n\"There's definitely something.\"  He folds one arm across his chest, the other supporting his head as he rubs his chin squinting at me, trying to deduce what this 'something' is.  I can feel myself glaring back at him, uncomfortable with being viewed like a piece of abstract art.\n\n\"There is nothing sir.  Now, my report?\"  I roll my eyes, returning my stare to neutral.  I can't explain to our esteemed captain that I'm distracted purely by my own subconscious.  I'm not so fragile of mind to let this prevent me from doing my job.\n\n\"Hm?  Oh yes, yes!\"  My Lord waves his hand as if swatting the conversation away, returning to his previous position with his palms laid flat on the table.  \"I'm listening.\"\n\nThe rest of the meeting is uneventful.  Once work is complete, I return to my quarters to think on my duties further alone.  At least, I try.\n\nAgain my mind is plagued.  It's as if these dreams will not cease.\n\nSometimes the images that flash before me are mundane; a guardsman walking in the halls or a glimpse of an object.  These strange memories are easily ignored.  More often than not the depictions are wild and lack clarity.  I'm an observer in a strange world watching as scenes play out.\n\nLast night, I found myself wandering a beautiful garden growing a wide selection of fruits.  It reminded me of summers at home, the warmth in the air and the sweet scents intertwining, the bright summer hues, making me feel oddly at peace.  I travelled past trees and bushes, all alone in this dream world, until I came upon a vineyard.  The grapes which grew were extraordinary, gleaming in the light with the most vibrant shade of purple, their skin flawless.  Each individual grape looked perfectly ripe, and since this was clearly a dream I decided to pluck one off to sample it.\n\nThe moment the grape left the vine is seemed different; feeling like rubber between my fingers instead of the tenderness one expects of ripened fruit.  On closer examination the grape was in fact not a grape at all, but a cheap imitation.  As the realisation washed over me the illusion of the garden broke, and I was able to see that everything around me, from the vines to the fruits, trees and bushes, were all fakes; obviously made from plastics or other synthesized materials.  The sugary smells of the fruit disappeared instantly as I was hit instead with the overpowering stink of vinegar, followed by the fowl stench of rotting produce.  The sudden shock to my system brought on by the putrid funk was enough to rouse me back awake.\n\nI know better than to pay attention to silly things like idol fantasies, but I can't shake the feeling that this somehow means something.  In the past my dreams, while believable at the time, fall apart when consciousness arrives.  Any sensations felt while asleep were sub-par to that of reality, making them easy to rationalise away and forget.\n\nBut this has not been the case lately.  Not only am I *aware* that I am dreaming, but the experiences contained within said apparitions feel real, even with hindsight.  True the content itself is bizarre and eccentric, but the situation on the whole feels far to complex to write off as just an ordinary dream.\n\nAm I having some sort of break down?  Perhaps this is delayed shock brought on by the severe losses suffered in the raid; it was fairly soon afterwards that these visions began to occur.\n\nNo, not visions.  Calling them that would be to imply something unspeakable.\n\nWould it be wrong to consider the possibility though?  Could they somehow *be* visions?  I don't know enough to even begin to speculate.  Something like that would be a terrible jump to conclusions simply based on a delusion.  Until I have some proof, they are just that.\n\nOnly dreams.\n\n\nWhenever we make port I always feel refreshed and rejuvenated.  I never considered I would miss something so simple like a market place or walking around outside in the sunlight, as growing up I kept to myself inside the library as much as I possibly could.  But in view of their absence, I find them an enjoyable experience when the time allows.  This is when I get to fully test my skills and prove my worth as Seneschal.\n\nIt is true, after losing so much of the Winter's empire in one shot many of our contacts have cut ties.  It doesn't matter however.  The ones we had left have kept us afloat, while the blank slate gives Klaus and I a chance to take the family in an entirely new direction.\n\nI walk around the business sector with my Lord, looking for ventures that take our fancy.  Trying to keep him under control appears to be today's challenge, pulling him away from anything useless or misleading.  I would hate to tear our budget apart by including features that will ultimately be a waste of our time, especially when there are more pressing upgrades.\n\n\"Kaleb,\" Klaus speaks up after we make a strategic turn away from a stand with a flashing sign reading 'cushion dispensers', \"there's this thing I want you to try sometime.  It's called 'fun'.\"\n\n\"Fun is for after work sir, not during.\"\n\n\"Yes, but - \" he flails his hands around \"- when are you *not* working?\"\n\nI turn to face him briefly.  \"Precisely sir.\"  He pulls a face somewhere between a scowl and a pout.  I look back away and prepare myself for the imminent lecture he's about to spew.\n\n\"I don't like your tone Kaleb.  In fact, I'm the Rogue Trader.  I can order you to have fun!\"\n\nI raise an eyebrow at this.  \"Then will you be speaking with our contacts alone sir?  If this is indeed an order, I could provide you with the numbers, pre-written responses and list of quirks of all our associates.  You wouldn't believe what trivial things anger some of these people.\"\n\nMy Lord's eyes flicker to the side, then once again he throws his hands about.  \"You didn't let me finish!  I order it for later.  This is a pre-order.\"\n\n\"Ah, I see.  My mistake sir.\"  I hold onto the side of my glasses, using the action to mask the smirk growing on my lips from view.  After I collect myself we continue our route around port until Klaus stops once again, something catching his eye.\n\n\"Kaleb look, wine!\"\n\nI swear, he will forever be a child.  \"Yes sir.\"  I go to move on, though I can't help but notice something peculiar.  The bottles are all marked with an image, an illustrated bunch of grapes whose purple colour eerily matches the shade from my dream.  I can't help but stare for a second.\n\nThis means nothing.  It's all purely circumstantial.  Irrational, paranoid ideas linking mistakes and miscalculations.  The amount of wine Klaus goes through, it was bound to happen sooner of later.\n\n\"Welcome!\"  I notice the two businessmen behind the stall addressing my Lord.  It appears I spent too long day dreaming.  No matter, I'll politely decline and we'll be on our way presently.  \"I can tell you're a man who only drinks good wine.\"\n\n\"You would be correct sir!\"  Klaus replies enthusiastically.\n\nBefore I can interrupt, the stall owners begin their sales pitch mesmerising my Lord.  I suppose this is my own fault for being distracted in the first place.  Having absolutely no interest in their spiel I only pay half attention, turning back to their product to study it further.\n\nThe bottles are all decoratively extravagant, the labels coated with a golden trim around the edges.  They have certainly gone out of their way to impress people, but a fancy label can hardly cover the taste of inferior wine.  The owners as if reading my mind proceed to pull a bottle from beneath the table and pour a small sample, offering it to Klaus and I.  He takes the wine presented to him, and I out of respectful obligation follow suit.\n\nLike the colour of the label, the wine triggers an uncomfortably familiar response.  It carries a sweet smell, strikingly similar to the atmosphere which stood out clearly during the dream.  But again, this may be something I have simply experienced before, perhaps recognising the wine.  The brand doesn't ring any bells immediately though.  This is all very strange.\n\nStranger still if I consider what became of the impressive atheistic in the dream by the end.\n\nThis is madness.  If I'm going to question myself at every turn, then I need to either prove myself wrong or right.  Only then will these ridiculous notions be put to bed.  I pop the wine sample down next to Klaus who snaps it up almost reflexively, and move towards the bottles of stock being sold in crates.  Carefully I run a finger down the neck of one of the bottles, before picking it up and fully inspecting it.\n\n\"Do you wish to buy?\"  One of the owners glances over hopefully.  I turn back to the bottle, eyeing the cork, and begin to remove the stopper.\n\n\"Hm.  I think so.\"  My response immediately turns Klaus around so fast any normal man would have suffered painful whiplash.  One of the owners move forward to take the bottle from my hands. \n\n\"Sir, a wine this fine cannot simply be drunk from a bottle!\"\n\n\"Then fetch me a glass.\"  I stare him down, causing him to take a step back.\n\n\"Of course sir.  It's just that one of your stature -\"\n\n\"- One of my stature does not take advice from one of your lowly station.\"  He looks as if he wants to respond, but is too intimidated to go through with it.\n\nFrom behind the counter, his partner chimes in.  \"Ah, sir that bottle has been out all day.  Please let me fetch you a better one.\"  Their insistence to take the wine away is not encouraging.\n\n\"I've taken a liking to this one, but thank you all the same.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" he speaks up louder than before, \"you have yet to pay for that bottle.  We insist we receive what is owed before you take from our stock.\"\n\n\"Are you accusing me of stealing?\"  I raise my own voice, matching the scolding tone the man tried to berate me with seconds before.  Taking the wine in one hand I continue to pull out my family's seal from my breast pocket, an undeniable symbol of wealth and stature, and flaunt it on full display.  \"You dare question my honour?\"  I step forward, content to make quite the show.  Whether my suspicions are true, the result will be dramatic either way.  \"Or are you afraid that I'll reveal you've been boxing up vinegar in the guise of fine wine?\"\n\nA silence falls over everyone, suiting of the theatrical flair I've laid thickly upon this confrontation.  After a moment the man behind the counter, clearly the braver of the two, splutters a retort.\n\n\"How dare you make such groundless accusations!\"\n\nI cut him short.  \"Any noble worth his salt can tell a fake wine on appearance alone.  You have the real bottles out as a front, while you sell all the fakes.  Most gentlemen won't simply go home and immediately drink a so called 'special' wine, meaning you'd have time to leave before your scheme was revealed.  That is, if no one checked your stock.\"\n\nAt this point Klaus breaks into the conversation, eager to be more than a spectator.  \"Enough accusations.  Kaleb, pass the bottle here.\"  I oblige, giving the wine over to his hands.\n\n\"My Lord - your companion is making a mockery of our business!\"  The owner yells, his cheeks turning red.  He looks as if he has only begun to express his outrage, but quietens almost instantly when Klaus balances the bottle in his off-hand, unsheathing his sword with the other.  Before the flustered salesmen can say anything, my Lord skilfully strikes the top of the bottle, slicing it off at an angle minimising spillage and waste.  Both of the owners jump back cowering at the abrupt action taken, as the undeniable truth pours out and wafts into the air.\n\nVinegar.\n\n\"Goodness -\" Klaus slams the bottle on the counter \"-you made me get vinegar on my sword!  That'll stink for ages!\"\n\nI try to keep present but my mind is reeling.  Did I foresee this in an abstruse way?  Am I connecting dots that aren't really there?  I've come this far, and am slowly drawing the conclusion that this could be... some form of psyniscience.  If I am to believe this insane idea, then I may as well see it through to the end.  If I can predict the future...\n\nI close my eyes, clutching the frame of my glasses near my temple as I often do when I concentrate.  I want to see this dream again.  I want to know what happens next.\n\nThe image flickers to life on my eyelids, as I appear in the vineyard once more next to the rows of spoiled grapes.  This time I'm not alone; beside me Klaus is staring down the two conmen running the stall, who stand a few feet before us.  Their movements seem slower and blurred, their limbs leaving an imprint on the landscape creating an afterimage.  The pluckier of the two moves first, reaching behind the back of his belt and pulling out a concealed pistol.  Slowly I watch as he lines up the shot in my direction, his partner mimicking his actions a second behind, pointing at my chest.  The trigger click echoes against the complete silence in this realm, setting up the explosive 'bang' from the barrel to be all the more deafening.\n\nMy eyes fly open, the shot still ringing in my ears.  The scene before me is as it was, like no time had passed.\n\nThe conmen ready themselves, now aware that the sword is not meant for them, their rage continuing to rise.  The bolder man glares at me with contempt, blaming me for the reveal of their petty machinations.  He reaches for his gun, and as he does I immediately take hold of the Inferno pistol at my side.  It all comes down to who reacts quickest.\n\nWithout hesitation I raise my arm and fire.  My aim could certainly be better, but regardless the shot connects, burning into the man's shoulder before exploding in a sea for fire.  The round severs his arm from his torso preventing him pulling the trigger, as his surrounding flesh melts and bones turn to ash.  The extraordinary pain sends him into shock, bringing upon him a slow, silent death.\n\nI am not fast enough to react to his partner as well.  I notice that he already has his gun drawn on me, firing as I desperately try to evade.  The bullet whips past my arm grazing my bicep, as I thankfully avoid being pierced by it.\n\nAt this time I hear a battle cry from Klaus' direction.  Seizing the moment he sprints forward stomping one foot down on the table, continuing to jump across it landing elegantly on the other side.  He closes the gap between the remaining conman, who panicking tries to turn and fire, but is unable.  Klaus, being the master of close combat that he is, effortlessly swipes the conman's gun aside with a flick of his blade before lunging into an attack, thrusting his sword between the man's eyes and killing him instantly.\n\nMy heart pounds as I lower my weapon and take a minute to process what just happened. \n\n\"You need to work on your aim.\"  Klaus remarks looking down at the half-charred remains of my target.  I breathlessly sigh, returning my pistol to its holster.  My Lord spins around to face me, sheathing his weapon.  \"You have a very interesting definition of 'fun' Kaleb.\"\n\nI straighten myself out as an odd feeling of dread passes over me, almost as if something very unfortunate had taken place somewhere else as a result of my good fortune.  Quickly I push the thought to the back of my mind and attempt to calm myself.\n\n\"I couldn't let you be fooled by them sir.\"\n\n\"Hm, yes.\"  Klaus takes a bottle the men used for taste samples as he climbs back over the counter.  \"You certainly gave that man what he was owed.  Your reaction time was impressive.\"\n\n\"Thank you sir.\"  Of course, I did have an advantage.  I called forward the visions while awake, able to use it to avoid injury at the hands of the conmen.  That cannot be a coincidence.\n\nI can divine the future.\n\nThe rest of the day passes like a blur.  We explain what happened to the Arbites with very little trouble thanks to Klaus, and finish our business early due to my lack of attention.  Once back on the ship I return to my quarters and take in this new revelation.\n\nI... have some sort of power.  Why it has awakened now, or whether it will leave me as quickly as it came, is a mystery.  Does this make me a 'witch'?  How many instances would it take to be considered such a thing?  If I were objective for a moment, that sort of detail seems irrelevant.  No matter how you look at it any display of unnatural abilities would be enough to cause panic, and in a lot of cases are grounds for death.  If I'm sure of anything, it is that I need to know more.  I need to understand for sure if I really do belong to this exclusive club of pariahs, and what that means from this point on.  I need knowledge, but this sort of material is not easily come by.  This alone could earn me enemies.\n\nNo one can know.  At least no one should, but this may not be possible.  Surely someone will be suspicious of me if I all of a sudden start looking into strictly heretical literature.  I'd be driven away or killed very quickly.  I may need an ally in order to survive, someone who will help throw off suspicion.\n\nThere's only one person I can rely on.\n\nWhen evening arrives I come out from my room and swiftly make my way over to Klaus' quarters.  I knock on the door and after a few minutes, he emerges.\n\n\"Kaleb if you come around at night the men will start spreading rumours about us.\"\n\n\"I've heard all the rumours sir, they're mostly harmless.\"  Before he can follow up with any witty retorts, I quickly continue.  \"Sir, this is important.  I need to speak with you urgently.\"  Catching my tone, he lets me inside.  I know his rooms will be secure, so no one else will hear what I'm about to say.\n\n\"Sir, \" I start as he moves over to the sofa, \"I'm afraid I have something disturbing to confess.\"\n\n\"Confess?  So the rumours are true, at least on your part it seems.\"  He pours himself a glass of wine.  It takes every shed of willpower I have to not respond.\n\n\"No, about today's events.  I didn't know that the wine was fake just by looking at it.\"\n\nMy Lord looks intrigued, setting the bottle down and fixing his eyes on me.  \"Go on.\"\n\nI pace around, finally stopping behind one of the matching arm chairs and rest my hands atop it.  The simplest way to do this is to be direct.\n\n\"I know because I had a vision.\"\n\n\"A vision?\" He leans back into the sofa, picking up his glass.  \"You had a vision about bad wine?  Why didn't you say so earlier?\"\n\n\"This has never happened before sir.  It took me longer than it should have to realise.\"  I explain to him the finer details, all the dreams and individual clues, as well as how I activated my new found ability prior to the gunfight.  He stays quiet as I tell my story, only speaking up at the end.\n\n\"Hm.  Yes well, I knew there was something different about you.\"  He takes a sip of his wine.  I wait for him to elaborate but he says no more.\n\n\"...I don't understand sir.\"\n\n\"That was the thing.  Apparently you're a witch now.\"  The bluntness of this statement amazes me.\n\n\"Are you trying to say you already knew sir?\"\n\n\"It wasn't that hard to figure out Kaleb.\"  Once again he stuns me into silence.  \"I'm forced to spend more than enough time with you to notice these things.\"\n\nSlowly I move around the armchair and sit opposite him.  \"Forgive me sir, but wouldn't recognising this sort of thing make you a 'witch' as well?\"\n\n\"Of course not!  It's one of my many skills as Rogue Trader.\"  This either sounds like denial, or he guessed the truth on sheer dumb luck.  Whatever the case, I think it best to steer the conversation away from this topic for now.\n\n\"It can't be 'obvious' sir.  No one else can know.  The crew will revolt, or worse.\"  A visit from the Inquisition would have already been bad news.  Now it simply cannot be allowed to happen.\n\n\"How do you plan on hiding this?\"\n\nI look down at the palms of my hands.  There's only one way I can see working.\n\n\"I control it.\"  I close my fists tightly.  It may be an incredibly arrogant thing to think, but I have to believe it's possible.  I can't just fall to madness, not until I've achieved my goals.  \"I hide it until I master it, or it disappears.\"\n\n\"I'm sure many witches feel like it will just go away at first,\" Klaus comments, swirling his drink, \"but I think that's unlikely.  It is who you are Kaleb.  Besides, there are worse manifestations.  Why, this will probably even be useful to you.\"\n\nPredicting the future certainly had its advantages, but if the glimpses of what's to come are always so vague then it might not be the most useful information.  Today's experiment also proved that the future can be changed.  I was never shot after all.  It seems I should take what I see with a pinch of salt.\n\n\"You have a point.\"\n\n\"Come now, cheer up.\"  Klaus puts his glass back on the coffee table in front of him, refilling it along with a second.  He raises the spare glass, offering it to me.  I take the wine and courteously nod in appreciation.  \"Thank you for coming to me with this.  If you see anything of value, let me know.\"\n\nThe rest of the evening is pleasant, with nothing more said on the matter.  For the first time in ages I manage a peaceful sleep, and wake up with a brand new prospective.  I will need to put a few precautions into place, but until then I seek to learn more; to know the dark secrets of the world I have been thrust into.\n\nThe world of a witch.\n\n----------------------\n\n----------------------\n[Start](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3dfr45/tales_from_a_seneschal_rogue_trader/) | [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3ghdp7/tales_from_a_seneschal_part_5_rogue_trader/) | [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3i4hxx/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_6/) | [Last](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3i4hxx/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_6/)",

        "text": " So our journey starts with 4 guys with D&amp;D 5e who have no idea what they're doing in a town called Eden. Our three heroes, a dragonborn cleric, a human paladin and a drow rogue are greeted in a tavern by a guard looking for mercenaries. Our little crew being eager to earn some gold quickly agree to become guards for a meeting between delegates who are here to discuss how to properly tax farmers without farms. So the crew take up positions behind a nordic delegate who seems keen on trying to get some taxes for himself. Several boring in game hours go by and shouting is heard outside. Our rogue eager for combat leaves bringing nearly all the guards with him. Little to our group the rogue is in on the deal and is being paid to lead the guards away. So the rogue and his group of guards leave all that's left is our paladin and cleric and 4 novice paladins who were too scared to follow the rogue. Suddenly the lights go out and some assassins have snuck into the room! Our paladin thinking quickly decides to light a torch and order the delegates behind him and the guards next to him. But by the time the torch is lit only two of the original six delegates are left alive, a ork chief and the nord. The ork being a ork I (the dm) decide to roll a d20 to see how he reacts, &lt;10 he decides to follow the advice of our paladin and &gt;10 he does something crazy. Of course the dice gods are smiling on our crew and I roll a one. Not really knowing what to do I decide that the ork goes into a frenzy and picks up the nearest novice paladin and throws him at one of the assassins. He rolls a nat20 for hitting and knocks both the paladin and the assassin out. The nord not wanting to be one upped charges the assassins and dies in a hail of crossbow bolts and throwing knives. Meanwhile our rogue is still leading the guards on a wild goose chase and has let loose a hoard of screaming frogs while he was alone for a second. So that the guards are busy looking for screams and finding only frogs. Back to our main group the paladin and cleric fights off the assassins but not before the ork chief gets heavily injured but doesn't die. By the time the ork is stabilized and the dead have been checked for vitals the main group of guards returns and the guard captain demands to know whats happening. Our cleric not wanting to be caught decides to jump out a nearby window and the paladin is arrested and thrown in jail. The cleric jumps out the window and lands in a nobleman's carriage and the noble mistaking our dragonborn for a prostitute begins to try and seduce our cleirc. Her being insulted decides to try and kill the man. Of course rolling a one and hiits herself in the back of the head knocking herself out, landing on the nobles crouch. The noble thinks why not and has his way with her. The rogue eventually finds her and they help break the paladin out of jail and on the way out of the dungeons they run into the paladin novice who was used as a throwing spear. He begins to question the party but our paladin stares him down and intimidates him making him run off and cry, almost alerting the guards. ",

Any off color humour that may be present in these stories is exactly that, humor, and is not intended to offend.*\n\n**Chapter 1, A New Life:**\n\nI'm not sure what brings my pen to paper, the story I've to tell is not a pleasant one, nor one of heroics. It is simply a recollection of events, placed somewhere that another may access it. Maybe someone will learn from my mistakes, maybe they will choose a different path. Maybe they'll know they're not alone. God only knows that's all I've wanted.\n\nMy story begins several lifetimes ago, I was someone else when I was born and someone else again when I came of age. But for now I'll focus on who I was when I first encountered the Kingfisher. That boat has saved my fat ass more times than I care to count and has brought with it an equal share of oddities and sorrow.\n\nI was on Greenleaf when the Kingfisher first burst into sight over the treetops. I had a pretty view of it as I was laying on my back outside the local dive. The bartender and I had disagreed very physically over how much alcohol was \"enough\". A Shrike Class ship, my mind immediately flooded with memories. I hadn't seen one of those vultures since the war.\n\nCurious and drunk I started to stumble towards the docks, wanting to get a closer look and maybe see who was piloting it. I didn't need to travel far though, the pilot had made a beeline for the bar. He brushed past without a word and went inside. I followed. He was greeted with a smile and a beer, I was greeted with a scowl and the business end of a spit can.\n\nAs I retreated to the patio to scrummage for dregs I overheard him ask rather loudly if anybody was a pilot. It didn't sound like there was much of a response. I settled down with a half finished drink, some fruity bullshit, but it had plenty of alcohol. After a short nap I heard the man come out, he sounded rather disgruntled.\n\n\"Heard yer lookin' fer a pilot.\" the words slid out from under my arm as I kept my eyes covered. The gorram sun was making my headache unbearable. The man paused and through a thick accent he asked \"What's it to ya mate?\".\n\n\"Whaddaya need flown?\" I could fly anything if I could get behind the stick, but people never seemed to buy that.\n\n\"She's a Shrike, Mid-bulk Trans, you want the job?\" he was nearly indecipherable, thankfully I'd dealt with a few of his type before, came from an ozzy-trail-ya? Something like that, never fully understood a damn thing they said.\n\nBefore I could say another word he slapped down a paper with the ship's undock code and port number, \"Ya Captain's a piece'a shit and I'm done. Go there and he'll pay you te drag 'is tiny ass 'round the verse.\"\n\nIt sounded easy enough, I'd piloted tons of Mid-bulk's before, was a bit of a specialty really, but I had had no idea that stepping on that ship would make my worst fears come true, that it would force me to face down my demons and seek nothing more than a quiet place in the 'verse.\n\nI stumbled to the docks and found the ship and it's captain. He stood at a remarkable 3' nothin'. Gussied up in some kind of white suit that was probably in fashion on a core planet somewhere. A short barrel shotgun hung at his waist, nearly scraping the dirt, on its opposite a regal looking rapier.\n\n\"You the new pilot?\" he piped as I stumbled past into the cargo hold. I grunted in response.\n\n\"Uh, okay... Well my name's Captain Doum. James Tiberius Doum. You stay here and get your bearings, I'm going to go find us some work.  Oh and tell that mechanic to stick around if you see him. You can't miss him.\" he turned and walked off. I never did see that mechanic but I do believe I met a relative of his later on.\n\nI explored the ship for a few hours before finally resting in the pilot's seat. The strangest feeling washed over me instantly. I felt... Like I needed a drink. After finding the Captain's whiskey I settled in the chair again. This time, I felt something that I thought I had lost long ago. I gazed out the viewport at the sun setting across the trees, a strong drink in hand, an absence of birds in the sky, and I felt safe for the first time in many years.\n\n*Up Next:*\n**Chapter 2, A Fancy Party:**\n\nWherein the Captain and Buttlett find a creative new way to serve hordourves to some rather rude dinner guests, and meet a very scrappy young mechanic.\n\n*And Then:*\n**Chapter 3, A Salt!:**\n\nWherein the new crew of the Kingfisher find that the Alliance isn't very fond of the captains negotiation tactics while transporting a large shipment of Salt through customs.\n\n\nWhile a little slow on startup these tales get very, very interesting and take the game in a direction that I think is unique and worth sharing. Constructive criticism is very much welcomed and I will be posting chapter 2 shortly, also the Requiem of Darius Shaw should be posted in the near future as well.",

You can check out a story from the same group [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3gwhzh/pathfinder_i_cast_web_or_how_the_newbie_sorcerer/).\n\nTo bring the party together I had them all be parts of a trade caravan; some were mercenaries hired for protection, others were simply travelers seeking fame and fortune.\n\nAs all caravans in RPG universe's are ambushed by bandits, one night this caravan was ambushed by bandits! The party springs to action, even the brand new player playing the bard, and a low level fight ensues.\n\nAn old warrior does his best to fight off some particularly bloodthirsty bandits intent on finishing off a husband who tried to protect his very pregnant wife. The old warrior is struck down just as the party manages to come to their aid. The bandits are dispatched and the old warrior passes on (after a dramatic monologue of course).\n\nThe party befriends the couple and some misdaventures follow the caravan. Eventually everyone makes it to town safely and the party has to solve a murder that lasts a couple of sessions. By the time they make it back to the family, the twins have been born and are doing what newborn babies do best: Cry their heads off. I put on a youtube video of babies crying at full volume and began to roleplay haggard parents of newborns.\n\n\"I cast silence on the babies.\"\n\nThe bard, the face of the party, the kind, friendly, smiley bard starts casting a spell to silence the kids. The father slaps at her hands and demands what the hell she's doing. She starts to explain that she's just trying to help and casts the spell. The room goes silent. Dad goes ballistic and shoves the party out of the house, silently screaming his head off.\n\nThe party, horrified by her actions, try to buy their way back into the good graces by buying cribs and baby apparel and constantly rib her for weeks on end about silencing babies.",

        "text": "Background:\nSo this is basically how my team of lv 2 players managed to take down a Cr 6 enemy without getting hurt\n\nSo the party goes thus, Oni the Brobarian, a barbarian who’s too intelligent for my own good… he is tricky, very tricky, he beat the dire wolf in his solo campaign by blinding it before the fight began with javelins. Kiro, or agent fallout, cause he started travelling across the waste shortly after getting a dog, he is a monk who specializes in one hit ko’s. Their dog and Worg pets (worg is a story for another day) and various npc helpers, one of them being a lv 5 barbarian so you’d think that she was the reason they won, but no…\n\nBasically their problem was a goblin uprising to deal with and the bbeg here was a Hobgoblin warlord.\n\nWhat you came for:\nSo party is making its way into a cave to deal with the head of a goblin uprising. After waiting for a massive army to leave the cave mouth in a black gates of Mordor esque hiding sequence they make their way inside and fight through a few goblins and their worgs then finally make it into this throne room place and see a super heavily armored hobgoblin mounted on the throne. \n\nThe room is filled with various goblinoids and in the corner is a caged giant scorpion. Minion starts the encounter screaming “intruders!” Oni gestures his Worg and points at the goblin who said that and shouts “FOOD!” and roll intimidation, four goblins lose it and start fleeing before the fight begins… The party starts hammering on the minions and bugbears, barbarians let loose and monk is popping heads, worg is eating goblins and none of them seem to pay mind to the leader that is walking slowly to the scorpion cage. After a few turns of knocking heads the minions are mostly out of the way, but big bad evil goblin has screamed at the scorpion enough to get it to play ball, now he frees it and makes himself a giant scorpion mount. Party finally pays attention to the obvious boss once he is riding his new pet and then brobarian ruins the plan.\n“Ima tackle him off that bitch”\nRolls a 19, hobgoblin rolls 3 to stay on. \nOff goes the hobgoblin and party is unloading on that scorpion, narrowly avoiding its claw and stinger attacks. \n\nDm: “so the two of you tumble onto the ground about 10 ft apart and-“\nBarbarian: “no im holding onto him, I wanna pin him”\n16 vs 6… boss is pinned to the ground\n\nAfter two turns of beating up the scorpion the boss finally wriggles free and readies to fight. He takes his action and movement to get away from the barbarian and what does the barbarian do with that opportunity? \n\nPin him again.\n\nAfter shit rolls for the subsequent turns the party has killed the scorpion and spent 3 or 4 turns kicking the shit out of the helpless boss who should have been able to party wipe them. His broken AC should have made it harder but after taking the shield away it became more doable. Finally he wriggles free again but it was too late, the party brought him from 97 to 6 health while he was pinned and even had the worg pet rip his foot off… he tries to run from a losing fight and gets stabbed from behind after tripping on his nub. Party stands triumphant before revealing that not a single one of them took damage, only the npc’s and even those didn’t bring them more than 10 damage…\n\nAnd don’t worry they took down a CR 10 next session with little difficulty, maybe I’ll tell about that later.\n\nTLDR: \nPinning is Bullshit\n",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3gy7d8/dd_life_is_too_short_for_a_bad_dm_a_clerics/",
        "text": "For my first story here, I think it would be appropriate to post my first ever session of D&amp;D. The players of this were a lawful good paladin who the DM never let fail, a shifty half-drow rogue who the DM never let succeed, an entity I only know as the Bloodbarian, and a generic cleric with no past because I didn't give him a background story yet. The paladin and rogue have adventures under this DM's reign in already, the Bloodbarian was new to this DM, and I, the cleric, was about as new as it gets. There's no way to properly frame this with an intro, so I'm just going throw in a disclaimer. \n\n*Names will not be used to protect identities and certain details have been spiced up in ways we were not graced with. As bad as I make the experience sound, I can promise it was worse for us.*\n\nThe scene starts with a young cleric of Avandra on road, coming from nowhere in particular and his destination was just the same. Cue a caravan on the side of the road surrounded by guards, drawing the attention of the cleric enough to stop to find out what the situation is. Cue woman giving birth in the back. You know, normal roadside caravan stuff. Normal or not, time to start doctoring.\n\nDM makes me roll to not throw up and pass out. Why you ask? Because there is blood present. DM thinks all clerics panic at the sight of blood. Arguing does me no good, so I roll. High roll, so the cleric just throws up. Not like sanitation is a thing in this game anyway, so the cleric powers through. \n\nAfter a long struggle for the cleric, the woman, and the baby, only 2 would emerge. As the baby drew in its first breath, the mother sighed out her last. The babies cries of new life rang in harmony with the deafening silence of his mother's death, and for a moment time felt as if it was suspended by the circle of life making its rounds. Then a roar echoes from outside.\n\nEnter The Bloodbarian. A brooding mass of meat and more meat. It wasn't clear if it was the smell of life or death that lead him here, but the cleric and guards knew he had to go. The cleric drew his crossbow and joined the guards with swords already in hand. 5 on 1, the odds seem favorable.\n\n4 on 1. \n\n3 on 1. \n\n2 on 1. \n\n1 on 1, and the Bloodbarian hardly had a scratch to show for the last 4. The cleric dropped his crossbow in favor of his mace and shield, prepared to lock weapons with this beast of a man if it meant even a chance of saving the baby's life. \n\nEnter the paladin and rogue. \n\nThis is where my attempt of spicing it up ends. From here on I can't even fake it. In the out of character, the paladin was holding off making it to the caravan because he knew as a paladin he would have to kill the Bloodbarian. He had to ignore that in order to avoid PvP kills. But it would work. Remember when I said he couldn't fail? \n\nWith a single word uttered from the paladin's mouth, combat stopped in its tracks. He had a successful diplomacy roll, just like every other roll he makes. In the DM's eyes, this paladin was a tower of light. Standing taller than an orc and with a body chiseled perfectly from an ivory pillar. I could easily fill an entire book about the extent that the DM worshipped this character and still miss details, but those are stories for another time.\n\nAs mentioned, the Bloodbarian stops almost midswing. After a bit of sitting down and talking about our problems, we established that the Bloodbarian needed to kill the baby to get blood for the bloodgod for religious reasons. The cleric and paladin needed him to not do that for religious reasons. It seemed like we weren't going to agree until the DM presents his solution:\n\nThe baby is retarded so it's ok to murder. \n\nIf you're waiting for any more details, there are none. That's the extent of it. Please finish whatever groans, eye rolls, facepalms, or lying down you need to do now. There's more to come. \n\nSo the paladin's player wanting out of this situation as soon as possible, and beyond the point of caring, agrees. I don't want to let my cleric's first encounter to end in a the death of the first person he saved. So as the Bloodbarian makes his way to the caravan the cleric stands between the Bloodbarian and the baby, shield between him and the Bloodbarian. The Bloodbarian steps to the side to go around, the cleric shuffles with. With a successful roll, the cleric is still in the way. The Bloodbarian sidesteps again, and the cleric stays on him with another success. Tired of this, the Bloodbarian simply vaults over the cleric and proceeds to cleanly and ritualistically spike the baby like a football. \n\nSo the victorious Bloodbarian, traumatized cleric, somehow not fallen paladin, and uninvolved rogue make their way to the nearest city as a newly established party... Seriously, I mean it. The savage Bloodbarian bowed down on one knee before the paladin and swore his fealty because the DM spent about 20 minutes gushing over who the paladin is in relation to this world. In case you haven't figured it out yet, that relation was basically Superjesus.\n\nOnce there we have some downtime. I decide to have my cleric head into the city center and sell his remaining healing for a bit of coin. This was a big mistake. Rather than just going out and working the corner like I intended, the DM forces me to have my cleric open negotiations with the Bloodbarian to have some of his slaves to go get some wood from the near by forest to build a stand and then determine payment between a cut of the profit or a one time payment and how much.\n\nThis goes on for somewhere around 2 hours *realtime* and only ended when the paladin walked by and told the Bloodbarian to agree to the cleric's terms because it was time to pack up for the night both in and out of character. Never played with the Bloodbarian again, so all that negotiating was even more pointless than it was at the time. \n\nAnd that was the debut of my cleric and I. \n\nI wish I could say it got better from there. I really do. But it only got worse until we finally booted him from our lives. I've since tried to recover that character, and I've made some progress, but he will always have the bad image given to him while under that DM's terror.",

        "text": "So I'm running a homebrew game with very new players. The most veteran of them are my girlfriend and my little brother, both of whom have played sporatically. The other four players are either brand new or still fledgling players. It gets a little annoying have to explain some basic (to me) things but they're a great group and have led to some pretty funny experiences.\n\nThe backstory isn't too important, but the party is ankle deep in clearing out an underground labrynth, fighting aberritions and other creepy crawlies that I like. Mostly Skum, Gibbering Mouthers, things that challenge but aren't TPK material. The party clears most of these things without too much incident; I expect this because I'm still working with them to understand how to maximize combat. The Bard doesn't know how her spells work, the Sorcerer is intent on \"molten orb'ing\" everything in sight.\n\nThey're running low on heal spells and consider turning back, but the loot has been notably wealthier down here so they agree to clear one more room and call it quits for the day. I grin behind my screen when they choose to take the southern corridor. My surprise is waiting there.\n\nThey walk through the entrance and a [Xill](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/xill) awaits them in the room. The monk rushes into melee and lands a solid punch on the Xill and the rest of the party set up to attack from range. A hail of crossbow bolts, sling stones, and even a bullet whiz past the brawl, and finally the beastie gets to have its say in the situation.\n\nThe three sword arms miss, but the claw + grab land and the bite + paralysis critically succeeds, the monk cirtically fails the saving throw. The dwarf monk is stock still and the whole party give nervous glances around the room. This is not going according to plan. The Xill leans in and the monk feels lumps slide down his paralyzed throat and start to squirm around in his body; this thing went facehugger!\n\nThe Xill turns to its next victim, the gunslinger/rogue (I know, don't ask), when the newbie sorcerer gets a great idea: Use that scroll of web he found a couple of rooms back!\n\nSo the sorcerer casts web, but doesn't check to see where the rest of the party is in relation to the Xill, which he had cast Web directly on. The rogue gets entangled, as does the alchemist right beside her. Plus, the Xill doesn't seem affected by the spell. Only the bard fires a shot at the creature as the alchemist and rogue struggle to free themselves from the webbing. The Xill cleverly begins to planeshift to the ethereal plane and the next volley sails through him. He completes his shift and walks right over and plants himself right back in the material plane in the middle of the ranged attackers. The Alchemist is the first to meet his wrath and is subsequently paralyzed and impregnates him in the same way. Finally the rogue has freed herself and fires a shot, getting a decent chunk of damage into it. The Xill pays no mind and chases down the bard where he prepares to impregnate her when the sorcerer, finally recognizing his chance, lighteningbolts his way to victory.\n\nThe alchemist and monk are dragged for three hours (due to the low STR of the remaining party) until they're finally brought outside and help is found.\n\nTL;DR A newbie sorcerer creates and averts a near TPK with magic.",

        "text": "Previous session here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3elpgr/beyond_the_wall_1_of_orcs_and_arrows/\n***\nWe left our adventurers as they fled the goblin caves near the village of Lundefeld, Arrow unconscious from a rather savage blow by a now-deceased orc. But his fiancee Charlotte was safe from whatever fiendish plans the goblins had. The party has also captured the goblin sorcerer, and the journal that he was holding. I combined the past two weeks of sessions because we spent a good chunk of time on worldbuilding and the plot didn’t kick off again until last week.\n\nThe Cast of Characters includes:  \nLindsey as *Perdenzia, the Fae Foundling*  \nDJ as *Arrow, the Would-be Knight*  \nCaitlin as *Freya Pendragon Kirkwall, the Forgotten Noble Child*  \n\nArrow’s body is slung over his horse Order as Charlotte keeps the reins steady. The others walk by her side, wary of any goblin pursuers. Freya hears hoofs approaching, and they quickly rush off the trail to hide. Only a minute later nine horsemen come thundering by, fully armored and riding towards the goblin caves. But the seal upon their chest is that of Kirkwall, they are men from the force currently serving as bodyguards to the royal family during their vacation. Before Freya can call them, they had vanished beyond a turn. The group decide not to follow, and head back to the village. Since they have the goblin sorcerer and journal in tow, they sneak into the old abandoned astronomy tower attached to the Kirkwall mansion. It has been left alone for decades, and Freya sometimes went there to get away from her family. They lit the lamp and tied up the goblin. Seeing as it was still knocked out, they left Charlotte with the prisoner and returned to the village proper, where everyone was glad to see them. Several houses were burned, and fourteen people severely injured in the goblin attack that claimed Charlotte, and it was feared that Arrow and Perry were taken as well. Once they assured everyone they were fine, they decided that they needed to help Arrow. There lived a witch some ways away, hidden away in her solitary forest hut. They carefully followed the trail until they found it, mesmerized by the strange and exotic scents and trinkets lining the walls. The witch demanded to know what they desired, and they showed her Arrow and explained the problem. She gathered up herbs and other such ingredients, making a healing salve that she dipped upon the nasty slice on the young man’s upper left arm. It started to heal, and Arrow stirred awake. The witch did not work pro bono however, and demanded that they return the favor, or Arrow would suffer crippling damage from a curse. The group agreed, and she told them that goblins had taken her prize pig during the attack.\n\nThe party, with a still wounded but serviceable Arrow in tow, followed the tracks that would lead them to the pig. It seemed that goblins were behind it, and soon came upon a campsite. Three goblins were preparing a fire as an orc sat nearby, and the pig was tied to a tree. Arrow, still a bit angry at the whole incident in the pit and the kidnapping of his fiancee, rushed into the clearing. Catching everyone by surprise, his great sword cleaved the orc right in half, before the thing could even utter a sound. Perry closed her eyes and focused on the fae magic that coarsed in her blood, creating an illusionary copy of the party so it seemed the goblins were surrounded. Meanwhile, Freya grabbed the pig. The goblins were in a full rout, one panicked fool tripped into the fire. The group fled as chaos gave them the perfect cover. They returned the pig and paid the debt to the witch.\nThey returned to Lundenfeld and were immediately set upon by Charlotte’s father, who demanded to see his daughter. They had left her with the goblin and did not want anyone knowing about it, since Freya feared the prisoner and journal would be confiscated by the captain of the guard. Arrow assured his future father-in-law that she was fine, and just resting. He’d get her back home before nightfall. The group then hurried back to question the goblin.\n\nPerry used her blade to cause a little discomfort, prying useful tidbits from their captured ‘friend’. HIs name was Tekex, and he was learned in the ways of lesser goblin magics. He admits that his capture doesn’t change any of their plans, because the goblins are working under a higher, demonic power. They were instructed to dig six identical pits like the one the party had found, and place a strange relic called the darkstone at the bottom. Once all the pits were done, it would encompass Lundenfeld in total darkness, and the goblins (who feared the sun) could attack unhindered. The party asked why they chose Lundenfeld, and Tekex admitted this was only a trial run, that their demon advisor had bigger plans that he knew nothing about. He also admitted that stealing Charlotte was just a ruse to try and get their demon benefactor a vessel that could infiltrate the village, and that plot was foiled by the party.\n\nThey left him in the chair, discussing what to do next. Tekex had told them the pits were dug in a hexagonal pattern, so they could probably find the other ones and take the darkstones. The hardest part would be breaking in, as there would surely be guards. The group agreed to work on a plan the next day, and went back to their homes. Arrow delivered Charlotte, and then snuck back to the witch’s hut. He had no money for a ring, but wanted to have his wedding by the end of the month. The witch offered him three golden rings with colored jewels, one red, one green, and one blue. Arrow took the red one, and asked what he owed. The witch cryptically said that she would come for her reward when she needed it. Arrow fled into the night, worried what he might’ve gotten himself into...",

        "text": "A little background: We were using a fusion of D&amp;D 3, 3.5, and Pathfinder so some stuff might be mixed around. Our party consisted of a Gorgon Swordsage named Bashro, a Drayad Cleric named 'The Badger Queen', a Goblin Rogue named Tiggy, and (myself) a Human Warlord named Vincen. We had been hired by this old man to go into an abandoned fort and grab these giant seals. We only found one of five, and it turned out we needed all 5 to stop the resurrection of the BBEG. Cue hunt for them. \n\nOur hunt had led us to a gorgon kingdom in the south, famous for fending off the constant monsoons with a magical artifact (cough cough seal cough). We arrived and decided to talk to the High Priest, to see if we could borrow it (we only needed it for the re-summoning; we could bring it back in a year) but it turned out the seal had been stolen a few days before our arrival. After an awkward encounter in which we had to flee the city because we'd murdered the High Priest because he'd turned Vincen (me) to stone because Vincen had refused to hand over our seal when the High Priest tried to take it, we found a Gorgon witch who helped undo the stone curse with a golden needle.\n\nThe witch happened to mention info on a lead we had, a human general that had gone missing after trying to invade but was dismissed as a culprit in the theft because if he'd lived, he'd be like 130 years old. She led us to his cave, we found him, all zombie thrall-ey and such, and killed him, retrieving the seal.\n\nThis is around where we became evil.\n\nBecause it was going to be our last session (most of us were leaving for school), we had decided to give a little send off to the first guy leaving, the player behind Bashro the Gorgon. We figured that with a vacancy in the High Priest position, if we had Bashro perform the magic ceremony with the seal that stops the monsoons, he'd be hailed as the next High Priest. Since the ceremony would be happening in 6 days, we had sometime to kill, so we decided to go big game hunting. \n\nThe needles that got made into Golden Needles (the objects that could unstone a person that had been turned to stone by a gorgon royal) came from Pork-upines; gargantuan boars with razor sharp needles on their back, that took several dozen men to taker down. We had four people and a bunch of interns. Our DM admitted after we knocked the beast unconscious (The Badger Queen refused to help unless we agreed not to kill it) that this was our \"gold drop\". The 400 quills we gathered could sell for 50 gp each, totaling 20,000 gp a beast. Enough to buy each of our characters whatever we'd dreamed of.\n\nIt was around this time that the rogue, Tiggy, inquired into property values (He'd been interested in buying land for some reason). It was around then that I accidentally mentioned that considering the amount of panic in the city from the rumors of the stolen seal, he could probably buy a place for flood sale prices. The DM said that with enough panic, we could get it as low as 5% of current value. We then asked how much money it'd take to buy the entire city at that value.\n\nOur DM said it'd cost 300k gp. He also said we were all evil now for planning to trick thousands of peasants out of their homes by fabricating the imminent destruction of the city. We were fine with both.\n\nConsidering we were still 280k short of the goal, we had 4-5 days left to raise enough money to pull off our plan. So we got hunting. Using our pooled moneys, we were able to purchase enough scrolls and peasants to humanely capture and incapacitate 8 more of the Pork-upines, netting us an additional 160k gp. We were still short so we called in a friend.\n\nEarlier in the campaign we had met and gained favor with Elior the Next, so named because it was believed he'd become the next god (in the world, becoming a god was a rare but possible endeavor). In exchange for the remaining money, around 130k gp, we'd give him mining rights to the entire country as well as some trade tariff reductions (both parties know that we were only buying the urban properties but both parties also knew that control of one would lead to control of the entire country). \n\nThe day of the ceremony, we set out plan in to action.\n\nWe had hired bards in the city to spread rumors that the seal had been stolen; even staging a fake theft in public to increase the panic. Because in this kingdom, all land was owned by the government/royal family, we had to cut them the deal; blatantly buying all of their land (except their personal estates). Luckily, they valued their lives and were happy to make the deal and flee with the money.\n\nThe exchange made, everything else became a formality. The ceremony went as planned, with Bashro the Gorgon being \"chosen by the gods\" a.k.a. buffed with heavy illusion magic and stopping the monsoons in front of the crowds of people that weren't able to leave the city in time.\n\n\nThe epilogue for the story involved our party, renamed the Thornhold L.H.C., increasing it's power over the country, removing the royal family all together and establish Bashro as the god-king (of the Dark Sun) founder of a new dynasty. Tiggy became the God of Greed (obviosuly). The Badger Queen became the Queen/God of Wild Beasts, and Vincen became the God of Love (or Obsession, depending on who you ask). \n\nI ended up showing the DM the story of The Industrious Rogue. He'd never seen it, and I found it hilarious that we'd managed to pull of something similar, almost as an accident.",

        "text": "This happened last night.\n\nMy party consisted of Drummond the Dwarven Cleric, Marlowe the Thief, and Tim the Elven Enchanter. They were hired to help escort a caravan from the fallen city of Meratti to another town.\n\nMeratti was the source of some turmoil, as recently a group of aristocratic mages (derisively named \"White Mages\" for their cloaks) had tried to summon/create their own diety. They were stopped by a rampaging hoard consisting of the local peasants and \"dirt mages\", but only after the aforementioned god was summoned and subsequently killed.\n\nThis caravan was the first to leave the city, and it was loaded. Marble statues and high-magic, high-value loot was being carted back. The progress was slow, as the carts were so full, and the roads were unsafe, meaning that the different wagons each carried armed guards.\n\nEnter our heroes. They weren't really part of the army, though Tim the Enchanter had helped with the initial invasion. Marlowe was simply looking to get away with bags of loot, and playing stow-away as a guard was as good a cover as he could get. Drummond the Cleric knew he was lying, but took the thief under his wing mostly as a way to practice his conversion speeches. \n\nThe Cleric worshiped a dwarven god of healing named Helferth, who performed all of his divine actions through the hearty application of ale. Helferth was a little known, reclusive god, who was virtually unknown outside the mountain community of Drummond's youth. Drummond was exiled because he believed Helferth was meant to be shared, something his dwarven brothers most emphatically disagreed with.\n\nTo that end, Drummond carried with him a keg of ale that only worked while he spoke of Helferth's blessings. Every single pint came with a free declaration of Helferth's blessed gifts, divine knowledge, or benevolence. Marlowe stayed for the pints, and the two became fast friends.\n\nNow the journey to the city took 3 days by a well moving horse, but these slow wagons were going to take more than a week. And every night, the caravan was attacked by a rampaging goblin horde, and each night they were driven back. On the forth night, they attacked in genuine force, with dozens of goblins swarming the caravan and forcing our heroes to fight their way back to safety. The battle was fierce, and it was ugly. The goblins overwhelmed much of the caravan, and our heroes soon noticed that they were focusing primarily on the wagon in the back. The one that belonged to Duke Lorian.\n\nThere was something under that purple tarp of his. Something valuable, guessed the guards, but none knew for certain. The Duke had arranged for northern barbarians who spoke only in gibberish to guard it, perhaps in an effort to protect his secret. Whatever secret was under that tarp, the goblins wanted it. Their leader, a fat goblin who carried a drum and mallet and seemed entirely unable to command the goblins at all, perched on top, yipping and hollering and cheering on the other goblins. Our heroes fought bravely, and sometimes foolishly, until they were able to confront the fat goblin directly. This is when he attacked, knocking the mage to the ground and threatening to crush his head into pulp.\n\nAnd that's when the Cleric's mace, struck the drum, causing it to resonate across the night sky. At once, all the goblins stopped, and stared, and waited. Marlowe sized the opportunity slipped in close, and cut the drum's skin, releasing a sound similar to a thunderclap and breaking the goblin's from their magic-infused furor. They ran.\n\nThe barbarians were largely dead, but the caravan survived and continued towards the city.\n\nThe end.\n\n...except.\n\nWhat was in that caravan? The heroes met and discussed, and ultimately, they convinced Marlowe to investigate. He slipped to the back and cut the flap open, revealing a stench that covered the caravan and left everyone gasping. Why was the duke carting rotten flesh away from the city. What could he hope to gain?\n\nBetween Tim's study of the drum, and Drummond's praying, they discovered the true answer - The duke had procured the corpse of the White Cloak's god, and was attempting to smuggle it away. The White Cloaks had sent the goblins to retrieve it, using the Drum as a totem of compulsion. With it gone, the White Cloak's had no way of recovering their precious, dead idol.\n\nWho should they tell? What could they do? They all agreed that someone had to know. But who?\n\n\"Wait,\" Said Marlowe. \"What if we were to... you know... Bless it using Helferth's ichor?\" \n\nSo while Marlowe and Tim engaged the barbarians in a game of dice, Drummond crept around to the back and muttering a prayer to the mighty and benevolent Helferth, he unleashed the Keg's ale onto the corpse of the dead god. It bubbled, and it fizzed, and the stench disintegrated.\n\nLater on, he built Helferth a temple. ",

We discovered that, while the job we were hired for (get a sore-loser gambler to cancel a bounty) is complete, there's more going on. He only held about half the bounty (we know, because we stole it), and all we have are some intercepted comm codes to point at where the rest came from.\n\nFirst order of business: get paid. Second order of business: find out if out patron will pay for us to keep going. Remember Rule Four: get paid as many times as possible. Turns out the boss wants us to get the rest of the bounty pulled, and he wants the guy who was behind it to answer some questions. And, important point, he is willing to pay to make these things occur.\n\nOkay, we're back in business. While we start doing some research into where to find this guy, it's time to go shopping.\n\nAlternate title for this session: In Which We Go Out Of Our Way To Avoid Being Type-Cast\n\nPlasma charges. Space-thermite, or whatever that hull-burny-gel-stuff is called. Two big, high-grade holoprojectors. Portable sound systems. One set of custom-fitted, high-quality clothes.\nAt this point our GM is starting to worry. We carefully emplace things at two isolated, deserted sites near the establishment where our target does business.\n\nAnd a red-skinned Twi'lek in expensive-looking black robes with trim to match her skin perfectly walks in and sits down across from him. I should at this point mention that this Twi'lek is barely over five feet, not red, and typically leans more towards infiltration and seduction. She is, however, adept at disguises and a magnificent liar.\n\n\"My name is--\" --telltale green flash, screaming noise, and explosion shaking the ground, \"And I represent--\" --second simulated turbolaser impact.\n\n\"We need to have a talk. If you come quietly, it can be a pleasant one. Shall we?\"\n\nI will remind readers that this is taking place on Nar Shaddaa. Four categories of people could be shooting at it with turbolasers: Hutts themselves, people with enough resources to not care that they're losing at least a corvette-sized ship to make a point, people who can buy off the Hutts, or people who outgun the Hutts.\n\nHe came quietly. The best thing is that we fly an E-9, also known as a ship too small to be hiding a turbolaser. Accordingly, nobody gave us a second look as we joined the tide of spooked captains bailing out of the nearest spaceport.",

        "text": "Okay, so I just read the Tale of Reginald 'Ragin' Reggie Dempsey, and it reminded me of my first time GMing with my flatmates. It was a rather chaotic endeavour, and I figured some of you may get a bit of a kick out of reading it. \n\nBasically none of us had done any DnD before, so we had to start somewhere. I however had done a fair bit of roleplaying online, so I had at least SOME skills to draw on. Plus Google. Anyway, I decided to go with the run of the mill \"Thou must slay the Dragon\" quest to keep it simple for starters. Climb the mountain, kill the evil flying lizard. Simple. \n\nUnfortunately, the players had other ideas. All up there were four players, a bard, a cleric, a ranger and a rogue. No warriors as I was the only one who had made a warrior character, but chose to leave him out to allow me to GM with a bit more of an even keel. \n\nThe story began well enough, in a village at the bottom of the Dragon's mountain. So first came the preparations. After getting lost, the Cleric almost got mugged, the rogue robbed everything that wasn't nailed down from the blacksmith, then attempted to sell it back to him. Turns out, the Rogue had a pretty decent speech multiplier, and managed to convince the blacksmith \"he was mistaken, that he [the rogue] had always had the items\". This was about the point I realised what I'd gotten myself into. Too late now. \n\nSo after a while of going back and forth, one of the character's quirks come out. This character, named Theodora, had a fascination with tea. As such, almost every action was \"I look for tea\" followed by \"I take the tea\" \n\nThe Bard played music in the local tavern to earn their beds, which resulted in him becoming a minor celebrity in the town, and even getting a tidbit that I made up to help them with the dragon. Something about a sword. \n\nFinally, the next day the set out and started toward the mountain, first having to traverse a forest. I figured this would be a good chance to toss in some combat to get the game ticking over and teach the others how to fight. So, while the Ranger tried (and failed, dismally) to hunt a deer, the others continued ahead to find a bandit camp. \n\nI think I put 4 bandits in the camp, make it even. Now, I assumed they'd run in and try and kill the bandits. Nope. The cleric instead strolled merely into the glade while the others waited behind a bush. The ranger was still off trying to shoot the deer, but so far all he'd managed to do was shoot himself in the boot. \n\nNow, the Cleric decided to offer the bandits absolution, to absolve their sins, etc etc. Que the roll. And up comes the one. So, the bandits don't believe him, that he's a cleric or something, and draw their weapons on him. The others choose to wait how this goes. The Ranger manages to wound the deer. \n\nThe cleric tries to calm the bandits. It again fails, and they try to rob him, their blades at his throat. It's here that the Bard chips up, deciding to use song of sleep. He subsequently saves the Cleric's religious backside by putting EVERYONE to sleep. \n\nThen, Theodora, the Tea Bandit, as she'd affectionately become known as, decided to slit the bandit's throats. While they slept. All of them. \nCue horrified stares. \n\nAnyway, after some back and forth, she does it anyway. The Cleric decides to build a shrine to his god to thank him. All he succeeds in doing is pissing off a deity, causing the deity to ignore him from then on. \n\nThen, we come to the mountain. Yay. After a bit, they end up in a cave. The Cleric has somehow managed to further piss off his God, leading to a -3 to all skills, because angering a god more than 7 times in a row needs some sort of punishment. So, in this cave they encounter a bunch of Skeletons. The Cleric asks his god for help. \n\nThe God causes a cave in, and blocks their exit. So they end up fighting these skeletons. Then, Mr. Religious Expert decides to have another amazing idear. He happens to have some soap, so he throws it at the Skeletons, hoping to make them slip on it. \n\nInstead, the Ranger slips on it, managing to knock out the Bard. At this point, everyone told the Cleric to sit the hell down and stop doing things, and they take out the Skeletons. Now, the Tea Bandit (who was the Rogue I believe) decides to search the cave for tea, while the Cleric tries to smooth things over with his furious overseer. Finally, after countless rolls over the course of the game trying to redeem himself, the God decides to forgive him, under one condition. Stop trying to make shrines. They suck. The God doesn't like bad shrines. \n\nNow they reach the Dragon. By this point we'd been playing so long that we were all somewhat falling asleep at the table (it was roughly 3-4am), but we were determined to finish, if for no other reason than to put this dismal tale to rest. \n\nSo, the battle with the Dragon begins. It runs smoothly enough, about how you'd expect. Dragon breaths fire, use rocks as cover, slow guy gets singed etc. Now, the Rogue, our beloved Tea Bandit, in all her throat slitting glory, decides to pull what I would call a \"Reggie\", in honour of the story that reminded me of this. \n\nShe decided to jump onto the Dragon's back... as it was taking to the air. Now it flew up, and up, and up. The Rogue had to roll strength and constitution to hold on, and with every roll made it by the skin of her teeth. Often one or two points from failure. \n\nNow, the Ranger (who hadn't made a successful shot the entire game, and had resorted mostly to just stabbing things) decided to take the beast down. He called to shoot its wing. He draws back his bow. And as that arrow flew, I'm pretty sure we all held our breaths. \n\nAnd he hit it. He HIT the damned Dragon. In the wing. And down it came. The Rogue had to make some more saving throws to hold on on the way down, but she made it. \nWhat followed was the shortest round of combat ever, as the bow shot had pretty much killed the Dragon. I think it was the Bard who struck the final blow, but with that it was over. \n\nHonestly, I haven't GM'd since, and we haven't had the time to get another game going, but that entire thing was over the course of one session. One long, long session. All in all, I'm proud of my flatmates, because in all my times roleplaying, I never thought I'd have to say the following phrase:\n\n\"The Soap slips up the Ranger... and he knocks out the Bard... And no, THERE IS NO TEA IN THE CAVE\"",

        "text": "I instructed my Legendary team of Bourassa the Vestal, Miron the Occultist, and Peveril the Jester, led by Reynauld the Crusader, to enter the Warrens and defeat the mighty Swine God.\nThis group had been together since they were all mere Adventurers. These same four heroes trampled over all opposition, whether in the Warrens, the Weald or the Ruins. They not only fought together, they drank and prayed together. Together, they had therapy to resolve their issues and to reinforce their strengths. They laid together in hospital beds to cure their ailments. And tonight, two of them died together.\nWinding their way through the Warrens, the heroes wisely scouted ahead, avoiding numerous enemies who would otherwise stand in their way. There were a few unavoidable fights but the only thing lost to most of them was the time it took to cut down the pigmen and cultists like wheat in a thresher.\nKnowing the vile Swine God lay just ahead, the party decided to set up camp in order to steel themselves for the coming battle. They feasted, they shared encouragement and they prepared themselves and each other for the fight. When they awoke, their minds were clear and their bodies whole.\nThe party wasted no time before entering the horrible beast's lair. They stepped inside and combat was entered, these four intrepid heroes against the huge, gluttonous mass that was the Swine God and his aggravating aid, Wilbur. Quickly they were shown this monster's towering strength. Miron cast his powerful Weakening Curse but the hulking brute shrugged it off. Peveril sliced off a piece of the formless flesh causing blood to gush from the wound. The creature, with impossible quickness, dodged the judgement of the very gods themselves, called down by Bourassa. Reynauld struck hard and hit home, smiting the Swine God with an awesome blow. The retaliation was terrible. In one vicious blow, Miron and Peveril were gravely wounded, while Wilbur stunned Bourassa.\nMiron's curse started to stick, but it mattered little at first. Even severely weakened, this horror had fearsome power. Eventually though, the Swine God was weakened to the point of frailty, his blows landing but merely bouncing off of the warriors' armor. Bourassa quickly healed the wounded as best she could while Peveril covered their enemy in cuts and Reynauld continued to swing his mighty sword into the deformed flesh. The tide was turning.\nThough severely injured, the beast began to once again ignore Miron's curse. Regaining his strength, he struck a vicious blow, sending both Reynauld and Peveril to death's door. Reynauld raised his banner and his strength was renewed though he still needed healing. Peveril was still on the brink. Wilbur squealed so loudly that it shattered Reynauld's remaining strength and sent him down to within an inch of his life once again. Bourassa could have saved the day. Her divine powers could have brought them both back to continue the fight and finish the dreadful fiend. But she was too slow. With one last mighty swing of his great axe, the brute struck all four of the heroes. Bourassa and Miron were both severely wounded. The other two were not so lucky. Reynauld and Peveril, legendary warriors, and two of my staunchest allies, were slain.\nSeeing their friends cut down, the two remaining heroes turned tail and ran. They left the dungeon defeated, with nothing but a bit of gold to show for their trials.\nOthers will come. New heroes will distinguish themselves and prove their mettle against the lesser denizens of this dark place. They will rise up, joining alongside the survivors. They will bring the fight to the Swine God yet again, to not only stop his murderous ways, but to avenge our fallen comrades. Until that day, we can only wait and mourn.",

Eyes, shortsighted from staring at computer screens, sweep around the room trying to convey a sense of mystery and discomfort. While this might work, it works for all the wrong reasons. When was the last time this idiot took as shower? At least 2d6 days ago...*\n\nWelcome, lost souls, to a drama of depravity and darkness- delving into the dolorous depths of deepest... uh, debasement. Our story begins with an intrepid hero, eager to assail the world with her fearless presence, and thus she staggers unwittingly into her DOOM. Her name is [Pratena, and she is of the rare race of cyclopses](http://imgur.com/YkJ1osX). She is employed by a mercenary organization under a matriarch by the name of... er, [partyboss. She's a naga and a bard](http://imgur.com/gs1gCRa). Pratena, hungry for adventure, and probably just plain hungry although that's not really relavent, grabs partyboss by the tail and marches her into a bottomless pit of evil and... well, general darkness and misfortune.\n\nThe duo fatefully enters the newly-formed dungeon, young in its- well, it really wasn't all that intimidating at first because the entrance was taken up by a witch who had made herself a little home in the place. Nice cozy fire, bubbling cauldron, the works. She didn't give the party any trouble. But beyond that... a twisting hallway filled with mazelike turns and false ends, each set with- well, actually there weren't any traps, the architect was just [an idiot](http://donjon.bin.sh/pathfinder/dungeon/). BUT THE NEXT ROOM CONTAINED PERILS THAT MADE THE PARTY TREMBLE IN THEIR VERY BOOTS!\n\n[Girallons](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/magical-beasts/girallon), having a pitched battle with the dreaded [Fire Elementals](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental/elemental-fire/huge-fire-elemental)! Specifically, the hideous and barbaric practice of knife-fighting! One of the slavering beasts was chained to the flaming elemental, and they were brutually attacking eachother!\n\nSo the duo waited until they saw the winner. The infernal Fire Elemental emerged victorious, reeking of charred monkey. The duo then made the fateful decision to ambush the victorious elementals, beating them with hammers and sonic spells until their flames winked out! Thus chastened, the remaining conscious elemental grabbed its hellish friends and discreetly retreated while the room's Roper neighbor slammed on the walls trying to get the screeching Girallons to quiet down. A truly chilling sight. Pratena, thus established as the strongest amongst the beasts, decreed (in Monkey Talk) that the room was now property of the terrible Girallons, and that she and her companion were going to go through this door now thanks.\n\nBut this... this led them to their untimely DOOM! For the next room was inhabited as well, by creatures so vile they defy description! Four legs of iron hardness, supporting a flat body capable of enduring great weight, with a sturdy crest jutting from its horrid back- okay look, they were chairs. They were in a room full of chairs. And there was something SINISTER about the largest chair, a VILLAINOUS affair made of leather-wrapped steel, set on a rotating base! It faced away from them, concealing a vile secret... the chair slowly turned, revealing...\n\nNOTHING! The chair was eeeEEEEEEMPTY!\n\nAnd then the chair ate Pratena.\n\nOur intrepid heroes took exception to this horrific assault, lashing out with busy fists and gouts of flame and song! The battle was pitched, as all of the chairs took flight and slammed into whatever targets presented themselves, but after Partyboss loosed concussive blast of sound, the chairs were crippled long enough for Pratena to descend upon them with righteous fury! Legs flew in all directions, with backings cracked and shattered! Not a survivor was left. Of the chairs, that is, our duo was just a little banged up. I MEAN HARROWED! HARROWED BY THEIR DEVIOUS FOES!\n\nMaking their way ever onwards, the duo spied through a door to find a fearsome being of crackling electricity, keeping guard on a mysterious room! The horrifying elemental saw the duo watching, and let out a horrible noise! Which was apparently its way of saying \"Do you mind, I'm taking a dump!\" Horrifying. The duo set about scheming ways to bypass this great opponent, settling on subterfuge! They assaulted the crackling beast with a splash of conductive metal, which made it spark and wail in mild discomfort! Enraged, the beast turned and... set upon its neighbors, getting into a bitchfest with its elemental fellows who were getting stoned in the other room. Ahem. Evilly.\n\nBUT NOTHING COULD PREPARE THE DUO FOR THEIR NEXT OBSTACLE! They aspied through the door, looking into a room filled with three truly fearsome elementals, doing something so devious that it defied description! Nearly. The three great foes were lined against a wall, lounging in contentment as they gazed upon a scrying device! A rectangular one, mounted in a metal and plastic box, showing a distant conflict of far-off foes! As they watched, the elementals pointed out brutal battles and heartfelt dramas, cackling with glee! The party could not hope to take on all of these foes, and thus they needed a plan to draw them away from the curious machine individually!\n\nFor a start, they harried the flaming creature by assaulting it with water! Enraged, the magical terror sprang from its location, punching through the door to better assault our heroes! But fortune was with them, and with confusion spells and a handy hammer, they smote the beast into unconsciousness! Next, they had to deal with another of the raging storm elementals, once more by splashing it with conductive metals! Its ire raised, the creature ambled to the door, spotting the adventurous duo before they could launch the attack! Whereupon it asked what they were doing and offered them a drink. Truly villainous.\n\nPratena then decided not to pulverize the horrible electric monstrosity, instead deigning to wait until a more opportune moment. Thus, she followed the thunderous creature into its den, where it invited the party to join in watching the live broadcast of the not-terribly-distant events occuring in [Rockdust Lake](http://redd.it/2vbty4), an area where bloody battle was as prevalent as it was pointless. However, Pratena and Partyboss were far more interested in the device itself, some sort of marvel of magic and/or technology! They decided to negotiate a price for the mysterious object, and then promptly left the dungeon to sell it for twice as much.\n\nIs your spine tingling yet? FOR THERE IS MORE!\n\nThere were more rooms to this dread dungeon of evil, rooms that the duo had not yet explored! Yet obligations seized them, and they had to retreat for a time, but they came back stronger and more determined to get to the root of this den of inquiry- INIQUITY! Or, ehm, sinisterness. The duo became a trio, enlisting the help of [Rose the dullahan](http://imgur.com/2G8Quoq) to assist in exploring the horrible place! In the party's absence, evil had spread through the area, infesting rooms that the party had previously explored! Sinister. The party returned to find that many of the elementals had been forcibly discharged from their rooms, confined to a pitiful existence in a sort of large hallway! True evil, certainly!\n\nThe party, enraged by this injustice, set about rectifying it in the only way they knew how- the promise of VIOLENCE! They burst into the captured rooms, discovering the dastardly Drow inhabiting it! The Drow, quick to attack and even quicker on reaction, cast a magical darkness and a sinister spell that made Pratena into an easily-identifiable target! The Drow advanced, attacking from the shadows, and... well, didn't do much of anything, really, as they only did a d6 and their poison was so weak that Pratena could drink the stuff and be just fine. Pratena, and Rose with her, then demonstrated their ability to see perfectly well in darkness by pounding the feeble attackers into a fine paste.\n\nBUT ALAS, ALL WAS NOT WELL! Partyboss, [who had been previously known to associate with drow](http://redd.it/2ue20h), looked troubled at the arrival of these sinister foes. She briefly explained that most drow were not the peaceful sort that lived beneath the party's home, but rather a brutal and barbaric lot with a fondness for enchantment, slavery and mutations. Undaunted, the party continued onwards, making a mockery of the weak soldiers.\n\nBeyond the next corridor, fell omens presented themselves. Pratena heard a snatch of sinister conversation, talking about some sort of \"abomination\", and the party swung directly into a cunning trap laid by two Driders! Their one-two punch of DEEPER darkness and faerie fire proved far more effective at blinding the party, and the horrid mutants closed in for the kill! Which was when partyboss simply dispelled the darkness and the Driders got their shit rocked, one of them being pounded in the face with a hammer and the other being forcibly hurled into a convenient slime monster who apparently had no alliegence to anyone. The party had victory well in hand!\n\nWhich was when... IT revealed itself. Upon first glance, a woman in chains with her hair in tatters. But a closer look revealed a face abused and distorted by torture and fell magics, its teeth elongated to needles and its eyes carved out of its face, replaced with expressionless orbs that gazed into emptiness! Her hair, carved to pieces and mutated into chitin and unsettling shapes! Her body, ragged and frought with burns around its iron manacles! Its dead, malevolent eyes fixed upon the helm of Rose, whose heroic will faltered in the face of such torment! All were shaken by this new foe, and Partyboss screamed a warning about the creature's malevolent touch... thus, the party decided to attack from a distance.\n\nWhich was when the shambling figure revealed that it was not constrained by physical space, and teleported behind the unsuspecting Rose! The creature let loose a wailing howl, and the area erupted into all-consuming flames! The party was greatly alarmed, not only by the viciousness of the attack, but by the sheer brutality of its ragged appearence- its baleful gaze swept over the horrified party, blood weeping from its mangled eyes, as it bayed for death- either that of its opponents, or its own. So great was its torment that Partyboss was blinded by its sheer corrupt appearance! Rose, already shaken, devolved into panic and began to flee!\n\nThe rotting arms of the hideous creature swept out to pursue, but Rose was protected by her magical enchantments and during her flight, she cast a powerful spell upon Pratena- who, not daring to touch the vile skin of the hideous creature, elected to bash it with the hammer that Rose had forged for her so recently. The blow struck true, but only once, and the damage was paltry! Their opponent advanced, mangled hands jangling with the weight of its manacles, and its fingers rotted away everything it touched! Pratena and Rose fought valiantly against a powerful curse which threatened to chill their blood and send them into helpless spasms!\n\nThe panicked Partyboss, who had been spared the worst of this by merely being blinded, could not figure out how to fight this terrible opponent without seeing it. Thus, she decided that her charges could best use assistance by way of inspiring song, a tune that had helped her during times of great weakness, that banished mindless fear and made heroic hearts swell! And swell they did, for both Pratena and Rose regained their senses in time to renew the assault on their foe! Weapons flashed and stabbed, but the dreadful opponent dodged nearly every strike with a vile grace, and shrugged off the worst of the damage. Its retailiation came in the form of another torturous touch, paralyzing Rose on the spot!\n\nPratena, her heart lifted by her friend's encouragement and enraged by her other friend's plight, went into a fury. She lashed out with a spell that began to choke the life out of the horrid foe. Pratena then pulled out an old axe bequeathed unto her by her deceased mother, and struck the immobilized monstrosity once- twice! Thrice! The blade of the axe bit into the pallid flesh, smoking and sissling with the righteous fury of the assault, and the bite of Cold Iron. The mockery of life faltered in the [Broken-Soul Nymph](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/unique-monsters/cr-10/defaced-nymph), its whole form changing to match the deadness of its eyes. And slowly, the ragged creature fell... upon the helpless form of Rose... who was not pleased by this development.\n\n*Click*",

        "text": "There's a certain holiday celebrated in my [weird world of odds and odditites](http://redd.it/3bygoe), one invented by orcs. It's called Forge Day, and it's celebrated at the summer solstice- It's a day when everyone sets to blacksmithing and weapon crafting, so that they can test out their new gear in a huge brawl. It's a very orcy holiday, made even orcier because it's not actually celebrated on one day, it's really more like a full week that leads up to the brawl ON the solstice.\n\nWhich is why [Rose the dullahan and Pratena the cyclops](http://imgur.com/a/VwwUP) LOVED it. Rose loved it because blacksmithing was almost literally porn to her, and Pratena loved it for all the awesome stuff she got to try out, and all the family members that would be attending.\n\nThus, the two-man party burst into Pratena's hometown, dead set on GETTING THINGS DONE. Pratena's goals were to catch up with folks (mostly to show off how she had grown 5 feet taller in the year she'd been away, magic shennanegins) and also GET COOL STUFF, THEN HIT PEOPLE. She succeeded spectacularly, tearing up the festivities in a whirlwind of orcy enthusiasm and meeting up with all sorts of old family, including her proud father and her estranged brother (who worked as a flower arranger/alchemist/bombadier).\n\nRose, on the other hand, had her sights dead set on SMITHING ALL DAY ERRY DAY. With no need to eat, drink or sleep, there was nothing stopping her from being the crown jewel of craftsmanship. She created dozens of masterwork weapons, a few pieces of armor, and some specialty items, such as a set of platemail made entirely of FISTS (it worked out quite well) and a huge mace made of weird materials that slowed down time. The mace didn't go over so well, because she accidentally shattered it and didn't notice until an hour later, when the pieces started to drift away in slow motion. Cool, but not up to snuff- redo it!\n\nAnyway, forging and meeting up with old friends went on for quite a while, until it was time to start the battle proper. Pratena would be entering the ring with an experienced orc warrior, who had some nifty gear- specifically, a shield that looked like a lion and bit like one. Pratena herself was wearing Rose-forged armor and a sweet mace that had been created specifically for her. Several blows (and bites) were exchanged, until Pratena [rearranged the lion shield's curvature](https://youtu.be/Ts_WDlgNMoo?t=1m43s). Rose's smithing proved superior! Cash, gear, and fighting, wooooooo!\n\nForge day is AWESOME holiday.\n\nA while later, Pratena decided to pay a visit to an acquaintance the party had met a while back- one Bug Enthusiast Turned Assassin. She had some down-time, and to Bugsassin's glee, she wanted to spend that time hunting the MOST DANGEROUS GAME... rare insects. Well, Bugsassin was enthusiastic, at least.\n\nTrouble struck on the way there, though! The entomologist duo ran into some nefarious creatures in the woods: [Weeper Nymphs](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/fey/nymph). A species of Fae that had been hunted nearly to extinction, these vile creatures had a nasty habit of impersonating lost women in need of help, and then murdering whoever showed up. Naturally, this made them so ludicrously rage-inspiring that every humanoid settlement ever was willing to pay heaps of cash for their weasally bitch-heads. Also they were right in the way of a huge entomological breakthrough. Well, maybe, but the point is that they were assholes and there was a bounty on their heads, and now that Bugsassin was officially unemployed he could use the extra income.\n\nThe issue was that these enchanting ladies had a special brand of Faery Glamour that was literally blinding. Bugsassin, who had first spotted them, resisted on account of deadly insects being his only true mistress. Pratena, though, had a problem- her will save was rather low, and she couldn't exactly not look at them while fighting them. So they improvised a solution- a headband and a Detect Thoughts spell! Ingenuity!\n\nThere were three nymphs, and Bugsassin incapacitated one by using his Crimson Assassin class feature: Prayer Attack. This kept the nymph occupied until three rounds were up. Pratena, meanwhile, proceeded to use a SUPREMELY HEAVY MACE (read: One that weighed as much as she did) to absolutely wreck another nymph's shit. FORE!\n\nNymph #3, meanwhile, was calling in a bit of support- that of a nearby owlbear. This turned out not to be a particularly helpful ally, as Pratena was nearing the Person Of Mass Destruction threshold, but it did give them time for both her and her wounded comrade to beat a retreat. With Pratena swinging nearly blind, she only barely crushed one before the other started to get away in earnest. This was not helped by the fact that Bugsassin's opponent critted her fortitude save vs being stabbed in the heart (surprise, surprise, it's a tiny and vestigial organ). Pratena remedied the situation by combining a Ki Arrow with her GARGANTUAN IRON DREAD MAUL (which was allowed on account of being FUCKING AWESOME).\n\nIt was at this point that Pratena noticed the rumbling. And the snapping. And crashing. And the buzzing. And the [HOLY SHIT](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130708043428/finalfantasy/images/5/58/PreyingMantis-ffxii.png) [IT'S THE BIGGEST MANTIS EVER!](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/vermin/mantis-deadly) The thing came crashing in, snatched up Bugsassin and took a big bite, and then Pratena punched it.\n\n...\n\nThat was the battle. Pratena punched it.\n\nSee, Pratena was one of those folks who used [Pummeling Style](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/pummeling-style-combat-style) a lot. Spefically, in conjunction with [Pummeling Charge](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/pummeling-charge-combat). Her fists did only slightly less damage than her INCREDIBLY LARGE MAUL, and hit more times in a round. Oh, and if one attack is a crit, they're all crits. And she critted. Thus, the horrible godzilla monster went from 152hp to -14 in the space of one round. ONE GODDAMNED ROUND.\n\nIn the aftermath, Pratena rescued her dazed hunting partner and asked him what to do with mantiszilla. His response? \"Why, this is the greatest entomological capture in DECADES! We must keep the specimen alive, and contained!\" So the nutty assassin provided first-aid to the horrible monster while Pratena lugged the thing back to town. Bugsassin then proceeded to blow his entire life savings on making a specialized Jar Of Holding (based on some nifty loot that Pratena herself had recently aquired, the Fishbowl Of Holding) to keep the monster contained and sitting on his desk.\n\nBugsassin thanked Pratena profusely for all of her help, and lamented his now ailing budget. Still, he had a real purpose in life now- that of studying the fearsome mantis monster, and keeping it well-fed. That would take cash, so he would promptly be restarting his old career as an assassin. Pratena considered the impact she had on the situation, namely...\n\n* Killing several members of an endangered species for fun and profit\n* Restarting the career of a hired killer\n* Putting a city-destroying monster into the hands of said hired killer, so that he could keep it on his desk and ogle it\n\nSo, all in all, a good day.",

        "text": "Entirely different game this time! For those who've read some of my earlier posts, this one isn't going to be first-person in-character simply because Darren is an unusual case where I have a very clear 'voice' for him.\n\nAnyway! This is from an Edge of the Empire game wherein we're playing hunt saboteurs. Got a price on your head and want to find a way to slip away or get it off? We're your team. We are not, however, stone badasses who expect to square off head-to-head with hunter teams and win. We are:\n\n* Alea &lt;Last name unknown&gt;, pilot, very late of Coruscant's undercity.\n* S74-RKY, AKA 'Rookie,' astromech droid, stolen property\n* Duke &lt;Probable alias, no last name provided&gt;, frontier marshal and medic\n* Sarahi Devereaux, Corellian, mechanic, latent force-sensitive\n* Ileyta &lt;Definitely an alias&gt;, Twi'lek thief and infiltrator, stole Rookie pre-campaign\n\nYou will note the lack of hardcore kneebreakers. At this point in time we are on Nar Shaddaa, attempting to get a bounty pulled from a card-shark. Our information is that someone lost a starship to him and got very, very sore about it, put a price on his head. There's more to it, but that we didn't find out until later...\n\nSo! Rule...four, I believe, is to get paid as many times as possible. Accordingly, our overall plan was to get the bounty removed by robbing him of all his money, then waiting for him to pull the bounty from escrow and eat the penalties for that, then rob him of THAT, then get paid for the overall job.\n\nStep one, recon. We already had some information on the target's favored dive-slash-casino, and so I went in early to scope the place out so we could make more detailed plans. I saw an opportunity and went for it, and after a few demonstrations with the bar's proprietor I ended up getting Ileyta hired on as a sabacc dealer.\n\nAfter all, we already knew this particular mark wasn't all too good at cards, and had a hard time knowing when to walk away from the table.\n\nSo the next day our pilot and mechanic make their way to the bar along with the astromech, who ends up having to wait in the atrium because of typical Star Wars anti-droid policies. This proves to be rather workable, as Rookie is able to find a data interface, and proceeds to wear the bar's computers as a hat for the rest of the night. Duke, meanwhile, is left behind to watch the ship as his player wasn't around for the game.\n\nThus began a 'four-player' game, with the mark and his friend supposedly not working together to fleece Alea and Sarahi, who are both supposedly not working together to fleece them in return. Things would have been fairly even except for the tiebreaker being the fact that Ileyta was the dealer, and the dealer was complicit in attempting to fuck these two out of every credit they could lay their hands on. This goes on for a number of hands, the stakes slowly drifting upwards, money drifting back and forth across the table but generally towards Alea and away from -- well, everyone else. Meanwhile, these two are being plied with heavier and heavier drinks, a *very* sensually-distracting dealer, and more distractions and subtle attempts to nudge them into higher stakes than you can shake a credstick at.\n\nFinally, the two have to 'take a break,' by which I mean 'oh god we're out of money and need to pull the bounty to get more money.' It's tine for the coup-de-grace. One-on-one, winner takes all for everything left, including a very, very nice blaster the mark tosses into the pot out of sheer desperation.\n\nRemember when I said this guy didn't know when to walk away?\n\nMore drinks. More 'distractions' from the dealer. Rookie hacked the sound system and started playing subsonics designed to negatively impact the mark's specific species. Alea stops playing it straight and starts to cheat. The dealer *helps* her cheat. We stacked that deck every unfair way a deck can possibly be stacked, in and out of the cards themselves.\n\nAfter he'd lost everything, he ended up crying on the shoulder of someone else who'd been knocked out of the game earlier after 'losing everything.'\n\nSarahi. Who walked off with the poor bastard's com codes at the end of the night.\n\nOf course that wasn't the end of things, but that's a story for another day...",

Our Navigator rounds up the group she gathered to hunt witches (which funnily enough can only track psychic auras so long as she is leading them) while Court and his followers look for more all-around suspicious behaviour.  There is barely any trouble taking people in (strange if we are on the right track), but nevertheless those who we do arrest are escorted into their cells.\n\nWhen our task is complete, the brig is majority full.  For a moment I wonder if it would be a good idea to separate the witches from the others, until Court points out this may give them too much of an indication that we k now too much.  Heeding the advice of our Voidmaster, we leave our prisoners mixed together and assign guards to keep watch.\n\nOnce this matter is done, Court parts ways to brief the grunts assigned to the Righteous Path, as well as deal with equipment and offer a prayer for good luck.  Odette leaves too, heading back to her tower to take up her navigator duties while I head back to the bridge to continue my work.  It doesn't take me long to determine who Tanlon is, recognisable by his red cloak and other attire.  He seems familiar; like the Adept he has stayed close to us, recalling his travels with Zez to Majoras Prime.  I notify her not to include him when planting the sensors but let him go about his business, so he is unaware of our suspicions.\n\nAfterwards, I start to work on slowing down our arrival for Zez; requesting silly things such as unnecessary security checks, scans - as well as ordering a repeat of standard procedures 'just to be accurate'.  I may come across as a tad too naive or paranoid, but the crew do not need to be aware of the finer details.\n\nThis goes on for some time until we see her - the Righteous Path - outside of our ship rotting in her asteroid graveyard, hull split open.

        "text": "Born as the lesser of a set of twins, Jon Ovaltrays was constantly in his brother Jack's shadow.  Where his brother could do everything, Jon also could, just not very well.  At the ripe old age of 16, the twins were cast out of their parent's hovel, never to be seen again.  \n\nJack immediately suggested that the two of them should head to the largest city and take up odd jobs for coin until they could start their own business.  Tired of his brother's success, Jon secretly opted to split ways and make a name for himself elsewhere.  As with all adventurers, Jon's story starts in a tavern.  There was no more of a generic start that he deserved.\n\nIt's an odd sight to see a dwarven cleric, elven bard, and a half-orc berzerker all sitting tightly around a table, but as fate would have it, it was Jon's introduction into the adventuring life.  The trio were visiting here as a last stop before departing on their quest; one of urgency from the town's mayor regarding a kobold invasion from the southern forest.  Overhearing their droll conversation, Jon butted in and introduced himself, basically begging and pleading to help.  He accepted his new role without pay, as experience is more valuable at this stage.  Due to the excitement of his first adventure, he promptly forgot everyone's names (not that it would matter).\n\nCovered in sweat from carrying everyone's equipment, Jon was relieved when told to finally setup camp after a short 30 minute trudge through the snow.  After failing several times, Jon finally figured out how to setup a tent (where a 20 was a surprise, Jon's skill pushed this up to an overwhelming 21).  In the midst of fumbling around to put up the second tent, a loud growl interrupted the non-humans warming themselves up by the campfire, who shushed Jon's loud racket.  The party then decided that perhaps it wasn't a good idea to decided to leave town in the middle of the winter's night.\n\n\"Go see what it is!\" the fierce berzerker barked at Jon, not wanting to leave the warmth of the campfire.  While berzerkers prefer less clothing to allow for freedom of movement, it's still not a great idea when the temperatures are below freezing.\n\nGrasping both hands around his 2-handed dagger, Jon nervously stumbled out into the darkness.  Two small orbs of red fury glimmered in the darkness, several heads above Jon's own.  Not wanting to be called a coward, Jon yelled and tripped head-first in the fur of the giant beast.  Jon's head likely caused more damage than the dagger, which trimmed a few hairs from the beast's belly.  As quick as it had started, the beast licked the blood off its teeth, then sauntered back into the woods past the now vacant campfire.  \n\nIt's unexpected, but even a simple \"Psst!\" has a dwarven accent.  The sound was met with silence from what remained of Jon's legacy.  As much as Jon tried, his spirit would not re-enter his body no matter how hard the Dwarf's spell tugged at him.  If anything, at least Jon was good at being a meal.  After a moment of silence, the remainder of the party headed back to wash away their woes in the town tavern.\n\nIf anything close to a moral could be gleamed from this story, \"When leaving for a quest to the south, it's probably not a good idea to head north.\"",

Irileth and her guardsmen were lined up, and we were looking at the ruins of the Tower.\n\nAll in all, everything's going just fine. Walk up to the tower, a Guard comes back telling us to get out of there before the Dragon comes back, and then the thing flies in... and all Oblivion breaks loose.\n\nThe Dragon makes one pass, kills a guard with its fire-breath, and then flies out over the Tundra. I turn around, to line up a nice spell to help knock the damned lizard to the ground so that I could hit it with my sword... and that's when I notice the *army* of Spiders that's managed to appear out of nowhere.\n\nI have no clue what Mods made this happen, but there were about twenty spiders. A fair portion were medium-sizerd Frostbite Spiders, but there were two *giant* Tundra Spiders and a few smaller ones. All twenty of them aren't in combat with me yet... but they have locked onto the Dragon.\n\nThe Dragon pauses to hover, lining up a breath-attack from the air... and all twenty Spiders let off a simultaneous volley of *poison spit*. The spittle lands on the dragon... and its health starts dropping like a rock. It went from nearly full health to *nothing* in about five seconds.\n\nThe Dragon barely has time to land before it drops dead, and I start absorbing the soul. But I'm not able to stop... because all the Spiders have locked onto me and my little party.\n\nFortunately, I'm smarter than the dragon and don't just stand still for *twenty* different poison-spits. I get hit by a couple, but a quick spell rids me of the poison. My Fire Atronach is one-shotting the things, as is Faendal. Zora and Arrissia (Modded-in Companions) are charging alongside me... and wind up dropping from poison. They don't die, since they're protected, but it reduces my chances of victory *slightly*.\n\nStill, the Spiders died. We were victorious, and the first Dragon was slain with the fewest casualties amongst the Guards that I've ever seen.\n\nStill... I'm feeling a bit nervous. The Dragons I can handle, but co-ordinated armies of spiders unleashing their Poison-Spit like Artillery isn't something I'm remotely prepared to handle.

        "text": "SO this story takes place just a few months after the group’s first session. As I’ve stated before this is an incredibly homebrewed world with a few custom races.\n\nWith that in mind, let’s revisit the time they convinced half of a cult to starts a riot.\n\nThis story begins with a simple fetch/rescue a hostage quest. Long story short they had to get information on some demonic portal in the center of the island. They had roughly a week before spooky scary hell would go down, so they were kind of in a hurry. The group tried to get said information out of a local informant that they had dealt with in the past, but she was just a tiny bit incredibly panicked. Her brother from a small town over had gone missing and for once she had no information. She offered them pretty much anything they needed if they were to figure out what the hell had happened.\n\nSo after half a day’s travel they notice signs of a struggle. Perception checks all around! They found tracks and began following, though their progress grinded to a halt for just a moment at the party rogue got too literal again.\n\nRogue: “What’s the shoe size?”\nDm: “What now?”\nRogue: “He’s a teenager right? I’m just checking to see if the shoes are…teenager sized.”\nDm: “….Roll perception.”\n\nAfter a high roll it was revealed that they WERE teenager sized BAM they were right back on track. So, these tracks led to a huge forest on the island. The trees there were so large they could block out the sun. Last time they went there they had met a creepy ass masked man and were attacked by zombies. It’s safe to say they didn’t really want to go in again. After taking a few minutes to psych themselves up they continued into the forest.\n\nAfter some spoopy things happened they stumbled upon their friend(?) Pandora. They had met her and the masked man Tear in this very forest and had quickly realized that they were both batshit but knowledgeable. Tear spoke in riddles and Pandora gave one word answers usually.\n\nRogue: “Have you seen a cult around the area.”\nPandora: “Yup.”\nPaladin: “…where?”\nPandora: “The Black forest.”\nRanger: “We’re IN the black forest.”\nPandora: “Yup!”\nRogue: “Like where in the black forest?”\nPandora: “Near the trees.”\n*Cue party sigh*\nAfter a few minutes of pure, unadulterated frustration they finally managed to get the ‘specific’ location of the cult. It was only a little deeper in the forest. Pandora gave a cryptic ass message from Tear which was really the passcode to get into the cult.\n\nAfter only a few more minutes of walking they found the entrance. “There are two guards standing in front of what seems to be a door, it’s simply floating there.” The party paladin’s player (Who is also a DM) put his head in his hands and called me a dick.\n\nThe heroic/probably good party immediately got together and planned several creative ways to kill these guys. They sadly forgot that they had lit a torch and could be easily seen where they were. They were spotted by one of the guards who’d finally realized that pretty whispering light in the distance wasn’t just one of his daydreams.\n\nSurprisingly their first instinct was not to just kill him dead. They managed to convince the guard they were initiates to the cult and things were going swimmingly until guard A said something cryptic. They all froze in horror as they realized Tear’s message had actually MEANT something for once. After a wrong answer and a high charisma roll guard A literally talked them through the passcode while Guard B tried not to kill them.\n\nSo, the door opened and they were feeling pretty good about themselves up until the door closed behind them and disappeared.\n\nPaladin ooc: “I hate you so much.”\n\nSo after panicking for a bit and nearly slapping a cultist for trying to take their escortees (Who both looked like children due to magical shenanigans.) The group took deep breaths and began to mingle. The party Warlock found evidence that some of them were pretty unhappy with the setup (Probably due to the door disappearing and them not being allowed to leave.) While the others began to get a layout of the place. Echo (Rogue) stumbled upon another friend of theirs Ryia. She was there because her friend had gotten kidnapped by the cult as a sacrifice for some doomy cult stuff. She had made a scene before and was being closely monitored so she couldn’t be much help, she let them use her room though so yeah!\n\nAfter some fine investigation skills the group met up and began to plan.\n\nNow here’s where I tell you that up till now they had been pretty dysfunctional as a team. There was a lot of infighting and the only thing that had kept them together had been their mission. Apparently, being trapped in a separate dimension with a bunch of necromancer cultists that worship demons is enough to make them gather and sing kumbaya.\n\nAfter roughly twenty minutes of hitting their heads against the wall the infamous words were said.\n\nRogue: “Let’s start a riot.”\n\nAfter that it began to get interesting. They weren’t sure how to do it. Violence was a given, but it had to be carefully planned and calculated violence. After twenty more minutes of planning they had a plan. They needed to get to the second floor and they knew exactly how to do it.\n\nThe warlock: His role was to go around and use awakened mind on as many cultists as possible, find any unhappy with their situation, and convince them to help the party. After getting a few “BOY I LOVE DEMONS” he finally managed to find a sane person amongst them. After that he found several more and, after dropping in a clever line about his God he had managed to round up (And convert) half the cultists.\n\nThe Rogue and Ranger: They were the ninja’s of this plan. They both were equipped with these cool ass wrist mounted grapplings hooks they had received as a reward for helping a man named Cobra with a stealth mission. Alais (An npc they were escorting) would cast invisibility on them and they would move soon after the riot starts.\n\nThe Paladin: He was gonna punch people and be as LOUD AS HE COULD.\n\nThe plan went perfect.\n\nHalf the cultists turned on the other half and essentially started a giant mosh pit. The Ranger and Aithlin (Another npc) casted fog cloud to up the panic a bit more and the paladin? Well he ran into the middle of it as and started writhing. “IT BURNS OH GOD IT’S ON ME.”\n\nThe half supporting the party caught on and joined him.\n\nNow think of the poor guards in that room. All fine and dandy at their posts then BAM FOG AND SCREAMING. They had crapped in their armor before the ranger and rogue made it to the second floor. There they managed to find the cult’s leader doing weird magic shit. They immediately decided to nope out of there and wait for the rest of the party.\n\nAfter that they derped around in a room for an hour, fell into a trap, got sucked into another dimension and thrown into hell…That’s a story for another time though. \n",

        "text": "Beat.HotTopicToreador and Beat.AngryGangrel entered first, Beat.AngryGangrel already beginning his shift into a combat animal form. Sweep.Dah-veed was the first target, as it was his movement that had set off the opposition. The rest of Sweep Squad may have Obfuscated, too, which helped single him out. Sweep.Dah-veed took the first two punches with superb Fortitude, and created enough distraction for the rest of the pack to get into position.\n\nThe resulting surgical ambush halted combat before a brawl could get going. Sweep.Andrew and Sweep.Brittany were able to grapple and pin Beat.AngryGangel and Beat.HotTopicToreader, Jalees appeared right in front of Beat.FunBrujah, who did not even get a swing in before Sweep.Erasmus had staked him. The rest of Beataturgy halted and stood down following the sudden defeat. Beat.FunBrujah was carried inside, put in a dark corner, and unstaked. While not happy about his defeat without a decent fight, he conceded gracefully, and stayed in his dark corner to spectate.\n\nPack Super Sabbat were next, and considerably more of a hassle. Super.Tzimisce was first to locate the cafe, and sat across the street under a streetlight while he waited for the rest of his pack. Super.Lasombra arrived next, standing slightly behind and downwind of Super.Tzimisce, enough to be in the shadows, but not enough to hide his presence. Jalees could hear their plan, and had to admit that it could have work rather well for them - They would wait for Super.AbyssMystic to drop a Shroud of Night inside the cafe, then the two Lasombra would use their Arms of the Abyss in a pincer movement to flush Sweep Squad out of hiding, right into the two waiting Tzimisce would fleshcraft Sweep Squad into slugs. It could have work - should have worked, even. It would have worked if Sweep Squad, and all member of the column, didn’t have an Awareness specialization of Blind-Fighting.\n\nSweep Squad would still be disadvantaged by the liquid-darkness-and-cold material of the Shroud of Night, but not as severely as Pack Super Sabbat thought they would be. The difference would prove key in several of the exchanges during combat. Jalees relayed some simple orders to Sweep Squad as he saw Super.AbyssMystic arrive. The cafe was soon filled by an expanding, lightless, viscous stain on reality. It filled the entirety of the cafe and ended a few feet outside the front door. The Arms spawned shortly after, emerging from the already significant inky blackness, attacking at almost random, but attempting to herd those inside towards the front and into the waiting arms - hands, really - of Super.Tzimisice and Super.InquisitorTzimisce.\n\nHad Sweep Squad not been moving toward the entrance in a single file line, they would have needed to dodge many more imprecise and unpredictable Arm attacks. As they were, however, approaching the opening of the cafe under Obfuscate and informed of the plan by Jalees, they made it to the other side of the waiting Tzimisce before they had gotten into solid positions and could lock down their respective zones. Sweep.Andrew was first to be spotted, second from the end, and there was an instant of hesitation - or perhaps disbelief - until pack Super-Sabbat processed the appearance. \n\nFollowing that, the fight got interesting.\n\nJalees quickly broke left before backtracking to the roof of the cafe, using his immense Potence to leap up to it with ease. Sweep.Andrew, wearing the face of Jalees, split right, angling away from the cafe. The rest stayed put under Obfuscate, and waited for Super-Sabbat to take the first action. Super.Ventrue, the only one to not have appeared yet, was waiting. He moved into the path of Sweep.Andrew and took him down with a clothesline to the chest. Sweep.Andrew was moving at around 50 mph (80 kph) at this point, and it was only the great Fortitude of both him and Super.Ventrue that kept them from splattering each other. Sweep.Andrew’s feet went flying out from under him, and he bounced off of the asphalt a couple of times before coming to a skidding halt.\n\nThe Tzimisce had begun to move, but not before Sweep.Dah-veed and Sweep.Brittany came at them in a flying tackle. While they had the element of surprise, the Tzimisce had much better footing - thanks in part to their enhanced legs - and managed to stay standing from the initial impact. The Sweeps got solid holds, however, and swung the Tzimisce around to pin them in a pincer formation. The Tzimisce won in the end though, and went back to back - waiting for an opportunity to present itself.\n\nThe Lasombra were less lucky, as they had to deal with Sweeps.Erasmus. Sweeps.Erasmus was the one currently on rotation in Sweep Squad. Sweeps.Erasmus had been a Lick for far longer than anyone else in the column, on the order of centuries. Sweeps.Erasmus had been an English longbowman, and still practiced the odd weekend out of the year. Sweeps.Erasmus drew back the string of his longbow - okay, not really - he drew back the triple-thick spring steel cable of his steel/titanium/tungsten bow using the one inch (25mm) diameter wooden stake that he used as ammunition and took a careful bead on Super.Lasombra. Sweep.Erasmus then did something that he was not in the habit of doing often at all.\n\nHe missed.\n\nAs he loosed the stake from his bow ( seems an inadequate description ) his Obfuscate shattered, and it was readily apparent who had sent the yard-long, impeccably fletched projectile careening a good five feet off target. Sweeps.Erasmus took a breath and loosed another imprisoning shaft at Super.Lasombra, just as he brought his Arms of the Abyss out of the Shroud of Night behind Sweeps.Erasmus. Sweeps.Erasmus was a hair faster, however, and managed to take his shot before being grappled.\n\nThe problem, of course, was that he missed again.\n\nThe shoot went wide again, and Sweeps.Erasmus was swiftly swallowed by the grasping Arms of inky cold-and-darkness. He could fight the cold and the debilitating wrongness of the material, but the Arms were strong enough to hold him tight and not worry about him escaping.\n\nSweeps.Brittany and Sweeps.Dah-veed shot a glance at his initial shout of surprise and irritation, and that was the exact opening that the Tzimisce needed to reach out and bind their arms to their sides and their legs together. They went down hard, though Sweeps.Brittany managed to make it into a somewhat effective roll, and struggled to get back on their feet. The Tzimisce kept watch over them to make sure they remained as they were.\n\nSweeps.Andrew had been successfully unmasked by Super.Ventrue, and was dutifully marching his way over to Super.Lasombra. Super.Ventrue had been able to catch his eye and Dominate him into dropping the mask, as well as standing down from the fight and sitting at the bench  where the pack had arrived. They called out to Jalees, in a professionally taunting way, urging him to show himself and allow them to take him into custody - thus winning the game.\n\nIn all of the commotion, pack Super-Sabbat had forgotten about Sweeps.Connor. Sweeps.Erasmus had not, however, and his second shot had been to give Sweeps.Connor a weapon with which to strike effectively and efficiently. Sweeps.Connor had caught the stake and spun it around into a dual-handed short spear like grip, and waited for Super.Lasombra to relax in the slightest. Jalees, seeing this and happy as ever to be the set-up guy for one of his Brothers to take the spotlight, jumped down from the roof, back into the Shroud of Night and allowed his Obfuscate to wane.\n\nJalees walked out slowly, his hands held high. Super.Ventrue’s mouth dropped open in surprise, and the Tzimisce started to hi-five. The tension of Super.Lasombra’s shoulders eased off enough to be noticeable, and Sweeps.Connor took his moment to strike.  \n\nSweeps.Connor did not miss.\n\nAs he became visible behind Super.Lasombra, the beginning of an invective was leaving Super.Lasombra’s lips - cut short due to the three foot piece of wood sticking all the way through his torso, piercing his heart. He dropped to the ground as all of his muscles went slack at the same time. Sweeps.Erasmus was released from the inky black grip of his Arms, and went to check on Sweeps.Andrew.\n\nPack Super-Sabbat went quiet at that, until Super.InquisitorTzimisce began to complain loudly about how Sweeps.Connor had made an illegal attack, given that Jalees had already given himself up. Jalees countered that he had in no way indicated that he was giving up, only that he had shown himself and his hands. He had neither a white flag nor stated his intent to surrender. Super.InquisitorTzimisce continued to complain until Super.Tzimisce told him to shut up.\n\nJalees went over and had a quick mental chat with Super.Lasombra, before motioning for Sweeps.Connor to remove the stake. He did so, and Super.Lasombra finished his curse. He stood, shook Jalees’ hand, and asked him where Jalees would like him to stand. Super.AbyssMystic had already dispelled his Shroud and Arms, and Jalees called to Beat.FunBrujah and the rest of pack Beataturgy. He said that they were going to return to the park and wait for the others to return. Jalees would send Beat.HotTopicToreador to intercept packs Spooky Ghosties and Common Sense to convey the change in location, and then return with them.\n\nJalees had technically completed the objectives for the Game of Instinct - “have control of a majority of the Ducti” - but he wanted to give each of the others a chance to impress him. He hadn’t the time to watch their exchange due to the quickness that pack Beataturgy had arrived, and thought it quite rude of himself. He would allow them whatever time they requested to prepare, and would choose a location close to, but outside of neutral grounds.\n\nThose packs were not far behind Jalees and others, arriving only a few minutes after. Sense.Assamite declared that they would concede to Jalees, as he had completed the objectives first and returned within the time limit. Jalees expressed non-sarcastic, non-patronizing gratitude, and declared the Game of Instinct complete. He gave praise to each pack based on their strengths, and filed away their weaknesses for review with the relevant Ductus later.\n\nThe night was winding down and vamps began to leave. Jalees took Unit A to their headquarters for debriefing and a brief war room before turning the squads out on their own.\n\nAfter that he shared a meal with Shula and her husband ( ghouling breakfast for them, midnight ‘energy shake’ for him), woke their son - tall for his age, and beginning to show seriously above average traits all around - to read him a story, and then went to bed.",

        "text": "So no shit, there we were, our two meatheads getting intimate on the floor while behind the counter a man is spurting blood where his hands used to be, our resident bird-person is giving birth outside, and we were all about to be allahu snackbarred into crispy barbecue.\n\n---\n\nSome background:\n\nSo shortly after being introduced to Pathfinder, one of my friends came up with an idea for an evil campaign. We had a party of seven\n\n- a magus (me)\n- a barbarian carrying a ludicrously large greataxe\n- an antipaladin that was all about spreading disease, oppression, etc.\n- a sorcerer who specialized in illusion spells and so ended up being mostly useless (Goddammit Dave)\n- a ranger whose wolf was practically collecting ripped out throats\n- a strix ninja with an assload of points in disguise (which he tended to use in... interesting ways)\n- and an inquisitor who didn't really do a whole lot\n\nSo we all work for the fantasy equivalent of the Italian mob (complete with bag of unlimited soup, salad, and breadsticks!) and had been sent to a desert city to investigate a snitch within the organization. We make it into the city with only minor difficulty and I suggest we find out what we can and do a bit of shopping.\n\nWe head on out, and first stop on our list is \"Mad Mike's Alchemical Wares\". We ask the shopkeeper about his wares, specifically memory alteration potions and the like. He tells us about these odd potions he has that cause the imbiber to forget the previous few hours but also makes them believe they are a fish for a couple hours. We reluctantly ask to buy a few (hey, you never know when you need to make someone think they're a fish) and he throws some absurd price our way. So our antipaladin (the massive tank of plate armor and meat imbued with unholy power that he is) tries to intimidate him down to a more \"reasonable\" price.\n\n&gt;nat 1\n\nMad Mike laughs in his face, saying that he pays regular protection to both mafias in town and that we wouldn't dare touch him. This \"BOTH mafias\" thing catches our attention and we decide Mad Mike could \"provide\" us with some valuable information on the subject. The ninja decides to cause a distraction outside, pulling out a burka and bag of sand and disguises himself as a pregnant woman, then pretends to go through labor right outside.\n\nThe barbarian moves to grab Mad Mike. Mike is across the counter so he needs a reflex save to jump across and tackle him.\n\n&gt;nat 1\n\nInstead of leaping on Mike, the barbarian accidentally trips over the antipaladin, bringing both to the ground.\n\nBefore the rest of us can react, Mike pulls out a few necklaces of fireballs attached to a bundle of strings. If he just pulls the bundle, all of the fireball charges will be released, triggering a chain reaction and deep frying everything nearby.\n\nMad Mike starts cackling wildly while we begin to shit ourselves,\n&gt;\"Now you know why they call me mad huh? They said I was crazy, that I'd get myself killed, but I knew! I knew this contraption would keep me safe! Now one move and I'll blow us all sky high!\"\n\nThe sorcerer tries to defuse the situation by charming him, and fails (as usual), only making him more crazier. I'm standing right across the counter from him so I as if he is within sword length. He is. I announce that I'm going to try and cut Mike's arms off!\n\nIn my defense, it seemed like a good idea at the time.\n\nSuccessfully cut off arms, but nick a necklace. A few beads falling off.\n\nIFuckedUp.jpg\n\nThe ranger combat rolls out the window followed by wolfy. The sorcerer tries the same but ends up bouncing off the glass, onto his ass. Barbarian and antipaladin are still on the ground and they're not going anywhere. The ninja is still pretending to give birth outside, oblivious to our predicament. The inquisitor is fucking off somewhere across town.\n\nSo shit blows up but miraculously we all don't die. The two meatheads were tanky enough that they didn't really give a shit, I had good enough reflex to avoid the brunt of it, and the sorcerer I guess cashed in all of his positive karma in that moment.\n\nSo we pick ourselves up and all that's left of Mike is a pair of charred hands on the ground, which the barbarian grabs for later (Don't ask). As we get on our feet, we notice another necklace of fireballs on a counter across the shop that is beginning to slip off.\n\nWe collectively say fuck that and book it, except for the barbarian who tries for a diving catch and fails, eating a bunch more fire to the face. His 70+ max HP once again failed to give a shit. \n\nWe grab what we can of what little remains, including a few vials marked \"Fish\" so I guess we got what we came for.\n\nIt's at this point I realize I could have just color sprayed him and been done with it...\n\nlol\n\nWe run into the guard on the way out, managing to talk our way past them, all except for the sorceror who is taken into custody. Did I mention he was supposed to be the face of the party?\n\nGoddammit Dave...\n\n---\n\nAnyways, we break into jail that night (invisibility OP) and get him out, no worse for wear except for a slightly looser butthole, and the session ends there.\n\nCongratulations team! We accomplished absolutely nothing besides turning a man into a pair of Kentucky Fried Hands! Best villains ever!",

        "text": "(I'd like to warn you- these are new players with childish senses of humor... shenanigans will ensue)\nOur story begins a a dark room, our heroes bound in seperate cages. When coming to, they find out each other's names, and determine themselves to not be the enemy. We have Sheriff Maverick, a smoking, cussing, gun-slinging frontiersman (human) with a knack for marksmanship, and (sigh) Pussy Licker, a Khajiit Ranger who absolutely hates Dwarves. The kitty manages to break free of his bonds, but the captor enters the room, dragging with her a new victim, an attractive, tall \"human\" who is simply left on the floor in binds as the captor leaves to grab firewood. When she comes to, the Changeling Draconic Sorceress Kaidia frees her fellow captives and they find their gear in a locked chest. The cat immediately lights the chest on fire with the Gunslinger's stuff still inside it. He reflexes fast enough to save his guns, but not his tobacco. Gunslinger then shoots the cat in the foot. They discover the door locked, but a trapdoor is found underneath a carpet. Kaidia and Pussy Licker jump down, Sheriff Maverick standing guard. Eventually he joins them, and they proceed into a hidden dungeon. Not understanding checks fully, Pussy Licker sets off an arrow trap. Still not learning about Perception, they rush headlong into a dark skeleton filled corridor. Skeletons are easy enough for a gunslinger and ranger, however, and beat the crap out of them. The next door is guarded by a puzzle. I won't tell you how the riddle goes, but it takes them ten minutes IRL to figure out the answer is \"map\". Next room is a small child, cowering, who turns out to be the demon spawn of Namira. Of course, having never done anything like this, they pick up the child and try to help it. They beat it surpisingly quickly and escape the dungeon, running into the captor, who explains she was under the control of the child. They force her to kill herself, then Pussy Licker rapes her corpse, causing the other two to leave  him behind. Namira herself appears and offers the repulsive cat man her ring, which allows him to draw power from cannibalizing his victims. He decides he's going to get back in the party and use their adventures to feed. Rolls a 20 on bluff telling them he was under possession by the child still, and they both roll 2 and 4 sense motive checks. For a first session? Interesting",

        "text": "The room was frosty. An ice cave under the somewhat demolished citadel, there was Deox. Broken. Surrounded in flames. Tortured. Alone, despite another prisoner in the room.\n\n****\n\nThe marks on his body reminded him of his daughter's lifeless body in his arms. The fire reminded him of the village he could not save from that god forsaken cult. The clothes on his body reminds him of his mentor being tortured. \n\n****\n\nDeox has nothing left but brief moments of consciousness abruptly ended by reliving his favorite moments in life; which turn to the most horrifying events he has ever experienced.\n\n****\n\nA thin, pale man is locked in a cage near Deox; Locke. He sits there for a day or two in this cage. As soon as Deox arrives, Locke reads his mind. It was not hard for Locke to realize just how crazy Deox has become. Clearly, this man has snapped.\n\n****\n\nAs the party arrives to this room of prisoners, they catch Deox in one of his episodes; reliving the only memories he has of his past life. As the party listens to Deox reliving these moments, Kalista knows this prison of flame would be too dangerous for Deox to cross in his condition. Urgency fills her. Fear begins to sink in.\n\n****\n\nOnce Deox comes back to reality, Kalista rushes through the flame to come to his aid. Kalista, being less effected by the flames due to her tiefling skin, crosses the flames to talk to Deox. Face to face, Deox shows signs of immense sorrow. Kalista does not flinch as she sees Deox's turn face. As Kalista tries to reason with Deox. She tells of how Deox is the only person she considers a friend; the only person she considers family. Her words seem to not be helping. The panic increases. \n\n****\n\nDeox turns &amp; shouts at Savage, who was helping Locke escape his cage. \"MY OWN CREATOR HAS HIS BACK TOWARDS ME AT THIS MOMENT.\"\n\n****\n\nSavage interjects; admitting how much he loves Deox &amp; how important he. Deox can't seem to let go of the damage he has done. He tells the party that he has caused too much misery. There is no hope for him or anyone he has ever loved. The only way to keep everyone safe is to be gone forever.\n\n****\n\nDeox has another episode. At this point, everyone is doing what they can to help get Deox &amp; Kalista out of the fire prison. Knil creates water to help soak their clothing. Savage gets water to throw on them after they rush through the fire. Knil then hands a blanket to the paladin. Locke readies a spell. The party is calm &amp; focused. They are beginning to realize the severity of this situation.\n\n****\n\nDeox is considering to end his life.\n\n****\n\nThe paladin steps towards the flames.  Solon declares that the events in his life are nothing of Deox's fault. Deox snaps at Solon, shouting \"WHAT DO YOU KNOW OF LOVED ONES DYING DUE TO YOUR OWN IGNORANCE!?\" Solon tells Deox how he came to be a paladin. Solon shares a story all too similar to Deox's own fate. Deox murmurs \"Then you understand why there is no hope.\"\n\n****\n\nDeox, taking one final look at everyone in the party, says \"I won't hurt anyone again.\" With that, Deox burns in the flames.\n\n****\n\nKalista, completely heart broken, is sitting within the fire prison. Savage begins looking through his bag to bring back Deox again. Riddik squawks \"I can fix this. I can fix this. I'll be right back.\" Immediately, he flies off to what the party guesses to be the nearest friendly town.\n\n****\n\nFor a moment, it looks as if Kalista was going to join Deox in the flames. Solon, the paladin, decides to take action. He runs through the fire, being harmed far more than Kalista. As Kalista is distraught, Locke uses his readied spell, polymorph on Solon. He becomes a Giant Ape. This polymorph pushed Kalista into the flames, her skin searing slightly from the pain. \n\n****\n\nIn a flash, Solon as a Giant Ape, grabs Kalista out of the fire. He wraps her in the blanket, tucks her close to his chest like a football &amp; dives through the fire. As Solon dives through the fire, Solon roars in pain. Solon releases Kalista as soon as his body slams into the ground. Both have survived this feat.\n\n****\n\nSavage has all of his hidden necromancy tools laid out in front of him as he finishes the preparations needed for the ritual. Kalista reluctantly agrees. Savage, doing the ritual exactly like he had when he created Deox, was still unsuccessful. Deox's spirit was no where to be found.\n\n****\n\nAs the fate of Deox set in, all were mute.\n\n****\n\nDeox is gone.\n\n****\n\nForever.",

        "text": "So because **SOME** people can't seem to make a character despite having weeks to come up with one, I once again have to delve deep into my memory banks to serve up some decent entertainment. This little diddy takes place a little bit before... *ahem*... [THE INCIDENT THAT SHALL NOT BE NAMED](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3bpi74/dd_4e_why_i_hate_trees_a_story_of_wrath_and/). I was an elven rogue and my group had spent a good amount of time tossing ancient dwarven ruins and incinerating some chitinous goo monsters known as the Blight. After pretty much systematically killing every monster that was near our base of operations, we set our sights for greener, more loot filled pastures. To get to our destination, we had to pay to ride a giant flying purple worm (not a sexual euphemism) across a vast desert that was inhabited by the Blight. Things would have gone smoothly, if we didn't have to share the worm with other people.\n\nEnter a dwarven emissary. I forget his name but it was probably something generic like Kodlak HammerFucker or something. He gets on our flight and immediately decides he doesn't like me. He starts throwing insults my way, going on about how obviously shady I looked and that I should be thrown in jail immediately. He wasn't entirely wrong, my guy did look pretty freaking shady and was a fugitive from another country, but then he started making it about race, talking smack about all elves being cowards and such. This got my blood boiling and I decided to pay this uncultured swine back before we got off this worm.\n\nCut to later that night. Everyone was asleep except for the worm's captain and myself. Using my roguish skills, I sneaked into the tent of Mr. HammerFucker and began looking for some things to steal or cover in worm feces. While digging through his stuff, I happened upon his journal. Flipping through it revealed he was a devotee of some dwarven god whose name I forget so we'll just call him Dwarf Jesus. Then, I came up with the most evil thing I could have possibly done. Retrieving a quill and ink from his stuff, I used my forgery skills to recreate his exact handwriting to compose the following message. Brace yourselves for maximum maturity. \n\n*Dear Kodlak HammerFucker*\n\n*This is your god, Dwarf Jesus, speaking. I have inscribed this message where only you could find it because it is very important and I need you to pay attention. Are you ready? Here it is.*\n\n*I don't love you.*\n\n*You may be wondering why I would say such a thing. For starters, don't question your god you little bitch. I don't love you because you're such a scrub. You've never pulled any 360 no-scopes on any noobs and that is just unforgivable. Also, I'm not sure if you got the memo but I have required monthly sacrifices of Mountain Dew and Doritos for the past year and you haven't done that even once. What gives bro? I talked it over with your parents and they agree that you are a scrub and they don't love you either. You shall never be accepted into my great sniper clan in the sky. It's pretty sweet too, we have tons of snacks and hold tournaments every day. Too bad you're not invited, ever.*\n\n*Get wrecked and never write to me again,*\n\n*-Dwarf Jesus*\n\nI honestly don't know what's wrong with me. Something just clicked in my head and before I knew what was going on, I had already written that nonsense out and returned to bed. I- I think I might have some sort of mental deficiency that is triggered randomly by insults. Please send help, I don't ever want to go back down that road.\n\nSo we all wake up the next day and notice that Kodlak Whateverhisnamewas is nowhere to be found. We discover later that he had read the \"message from his god\" and thrown himself off the worm into the desert below. Whether he did it because he was sad that his god didn't love him or if he was just embarrassed that his god was talking like an eight year old who just discovered memes is not known.\n\nSo that's how I passive aggressively killed a man for insulting me using dank memes. Definitely not one of my finer moments. ",

        "text": "For all of you people who haven't played or heard of this game, there's a mode on this called Commander battle, where up to 36 players lead squads of around 20 AI troops and cooperate and hopefully work together to destroy the enemy. Now, here's the story.\n\nIt was a pretty tough battle, with a lot of ups and downs. Me and my fellow Prussian cavalry officers charged and defended while our infantry had been holding their ground, and eventually most of us had our troops killed. I and my Prussian cavalry squad had been killed trying to defend against an enemy cavalry charge, but this story isn't about me. This story is about the brave hero who won the battle for the opposing side.\n\nAfter a bloody battle, both armies were in pretty bad shape, with only 30-50 men on each side left. All of the French soldiers were on a hill defending the two cannons they had, while we had them pinned down on a hill, getting destroyed by our cannon fire. We were taking hits from their cannons, but our artillery were more accurate. We Prussians also had one thing they didn't have: Cavalry. While our infantry and our other cavalry had toughed it out and worked together to kill enemies, and took many casualties doing so, this officer had sat in the back with his squad of Prussian dragoons, and now had the key to winning. One charge with infantry backup would be enough to break the French lines and obliterate them, once and for all. But this glorious charge would not happen.\n\nAs we approached them, our dragoons stood a short distance away, not too short to do a good charge but short enough to make them seem not so distant at all. They advanced on their line, but they made the fatal mistake of meeting with the French soldier Gelmar. He had not done too well in the earlier musket volleys, and had all of his company but him killed, but he would redeem himself. As the dragoons surrounded him, he would have died if he were an ordinary soldier, but he was no ordinary soldier. He fastened his bayonet, and quickly stabbed five of them, causing chaos among their ranks. He quickly and effectively dodged all of their incoming attacks, and after he had done his share of the battle, he soon retreated and backed away, but not without the cavalry in complete disarray. Before they could hope to regroup, eight friendly soldiers rushed to his aid. They took out their bayonets, and quickly and brutally stabbed the remaining ten dragoons with only a few losses. Soon after that, we found ourselves outnumbered two to one, with no decisive charge in sight, and no hope of victory, all thanks to the hasty escape of a humble soldier with amazing bayonet skills. They advanced on our position, and we lost the battle. We strategized well, defended our positions, and put up the best fight we could, but in the end, it was all decided by the bayonet of a common soldier.\n\nEdit: Inserted some mentions to the factions to make it less confusing, and rewrote some parts to make it better.\n",

        "text": "*A quick word about the system: this is an experimental new TRPG made by a good friend of mine- you can watch the streams [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIVA52ocLvXm1G2gzb7u8LA)- give the man some love! As a system, it has a lot of similarities to Pathfinder, except that you have obsessive control over every aspect of your character (including Base Attack Bonus). This, combined with a powers-and-drawbacks mechanic, makes it very easy to create a unique and interesting character.*\n\nOur story begins...\n\nEveryone was going to die. They were going to die so hard it was kind of funny. Everyone on the ship knew it, it was just a matter of time. They had been given an impossible assignment and it would take divine intervention to see everyone through it alive. On the plus side, their deaths would probably be quick and relatively unexpected.\n\nThat was no reason to be gloomy or downcast, though. Russ L was a historian, a cook, a genetically-modified soldier, and was gleefully optimistic. It was sickening. The man looked like a linebacker that had some horrible twisted offspring with a demon, fiery red skin and yellow bone-growths on all of his limbs. His punches exploded with lethal force, and he was the strongest man on crew.\n\nHe was also nearly useless in ship-to-ship combat, being unable to hold a gun and having no experience with medicine or repairs. Still, he was determined to help, and so he had set about making crude decoys out of unused metal crates and spare flashlights. Maybe that would buy them some time.\n\nThe ship was closing in on its \"target\", that most deadly of space hazards... the dreaded unicorn. While adorable, cuddly, and prone to expel rainbows from every orifice, they also had an incredible knack for teleportation and psychokinesis. This, combined with an intelligence akin to a retarded puppy, made them a threat capable of demolishing solar systems sheerly by accident. If they perceived a threat, they would just toss it into a nearby sun. And the crew was hunting one.\n\nThe navigator was frantically panicking, trying to find some way of avoiding the inevitable catastrophe by muddling with the creature's feeble mind. The priest was muttering oaths and sloshing around in his exo-suit, ready to lend support to whomever needed it. The pilot had ordered everyone into void-suits while he \"got this baby into range\". The diplomat was manning the guns. The engineer was double-checking every patch job he'd ever made, including one that consisted of a wastebasket haphazardly slapped onto a leaky bulkhead. Russ... Russ was standing around, wishing he could do something to help.\n\nThe pilot swore, and in a flash of happy sunshine, one of the crew vanished.\n\nThe unicorn eyed its target with that bleary, stupid gaze that all unicorns perpetually have.\n\nRuss, thankfully in his void-suit, spun gently in the empty space about fifteen feet from the intergalactic menace.\n\nThe ship could not risk shooting, or hit Russ in the process. Instead they surged forward, trying to line up a clean hit. They only needed one, and time was running out.\n\nThe gun wouldn't fire. The unicorn had teleported its power core into a black hole.\n\nRuss seized his chance.\n\nHe lunged forward, propelled by a burst of kinetic power from his bone-and-rune-caked legs. Then he swung his fist in one hell of a haymaker. The beast's head snapped around, trailing glittery blood. But it wasn't dead, and the party had nothing left to throw at it. Which was when the navigator tried a desperate ploy- she used an ancient magical artifact to dominate the faltering will of the deadly beast, and make it hers.\n\nNatural 20.\n\nThe unicorn bowed to Russ, its silky back the color of hearts on cheesy gift cards, inviting him to climb aboard. Russ, who saw the opportunity of a lifetime before him, graciously accepted.\n\n\"NO F!@#*ING WAY.\"\n\n\"What? Why aren't we firing?\"\n\n\"Look!\"\n\n\"Is he...\"\n\n\"WHY IS OUR COOK RIDING A UNICORN OVER A TRAIL OF RAINBOWS AND STARDUST?\"\n\n\"Please tell me someone has a camera.\"\n\n\"Standin' on the bridge with me mates, hashtag DreamsDoComeTrue hashtag AcePilot.\"\n\nIt was at that very moment that the navigator crit-failed a roll to maintain control. The unicorn's doofy, menacing face turned towards Russ, eyes glinting with heart patterns and pure evil.\n\nSo Russ clapped his hands.\n\nThis is a rather big deal when your hands are coated with runes that explode upon contact. The clap did not emit simple sound waves, as those do not travel in the vacuum of space. What radiated out from his joined hands was not a noise or a kinetic force, but a semicircular arc of glittering blood, crystalline bone-fragments, and one ballistic unicorn horn, which shot through the hull of the battered spacecraft and nearly nailed the ship's priest to a wall.\n\n\"Russ L, reporting in... I think i just invented a new form of extreme sports.\"",

Then get a bunch of my friends together (Two were completely new to d&amp;d and the other two had only played one session of 5th edition.) \nSo since I apparently hate easy and simple things, I homebrewed the fuck out of this world. Certain custom races and a weird mana system. Took a while but managed to balance it all out for the most part.\nAnyways now we can begin our role call.\n\nThe Pirate, Echo: A Wolf Feras (kind of animal people) rogue/pirate. He was actually born on a pirate ship due to his father being a great role model and parent. He initially had a tendency to somehow fit his whole foot in his mouth during conversations (Despite having the highest charisma of the party) and after numerous death threats he finally thinks before he speaks. Has a tendency to disappear randomly on the party.\n\nThe Midborn Sophos (elves), Hyedael: A paladin with a bad temper. Serves the Goddess ‘nemesis’ and thoroughly enjoys going door to door and asking “Do you have a moment to talk about our lady and savior nemesis?” He has gotten three converts so far.\n\nAcribus, an Eagle Feras: A ranger who somehow ended up the party tank/distraction. He is quiet and has a little bit of a rivalry going with Hyedael. He once was launched roughly 60 feet into the air and Hyedael, despite being close to death, still managed to point and laugh. Can be pretty angsty sometimes (Walking out on a party a 6 year old threw for them all.) But has been getting better.\n\nFinally we have Ryyn. A mysterious Highborn Sophos Warlock: Thoughtful and quiet. He gets a kick out using awakened mind to screw with people. Has recently made friends with a 3'6\" Fire mystic that specializes in creating arcane turtles out of pants. Also managed to convert half a cult into worshiping his God THEN had the converts start a huge riot as a distraction.\n\nThere are a few npc’s that have traveled with them, but I will mention them when they come up. Anyways that’s all for now. I’ll be posting more of the crap they have pulled in a bit, just wanted to introduce them all first!\n",

Didnt give us much detail except that we served a group called the Imperium and that a lawful evil god of undeath ruled it. So we all went off and started our back stories. \n\nSurprisingly we all came back with vastly different characters. There was seven of us: The undead fighter Artorias and his pet dire wolf Sif (Dark Souls anyone), the fetchling samurai Tenebris, the dhamphir summoner Thelimir, the gnome cleric(necromancer) Zuzi, the human swashbuckler Rubidia, the human rogue Emir, and the orc barbarian Mok.\n\n\nSession 1: GM pulls the group together by having everyone be part of some mission to crush rebellion for the Imperium. We all meet up in this kind of access tunnel. Now for reference, Tenebris and Thelimir served rival vampire houses and thus didnt get along. Everyone introduces themselves and we begin to head off. Upon reaching the surface we are met with a red sand dessert. Rubidia decides to take command by using her compass to travel to Televieve. On our way we come across this scorpion. Kill it and slice off its stinger. Thelimir gets the bright idea to extract the venom from it. Fails and ends up unconcious. So here we are trekking across a desert dragging along an unconcious party member already. Eventually reach the city without much else happening. Rest at a tavern and all. However the orc gets kicked out and goes elsewhere to drink. Finds an adventuring party where some are drinking ale. Hes a mead drinker. Fight breaks out and he dies.... he was already drunk. Not much else interesting happened. Met the general of the imperium forces. Usual plot stuff. Oh and the orc was replaced by a local human bard named Saffron.\n\nLet me know if you want to know more. We've had plenty of sessions and plenty of ridiculous stuff happen",

After I told them of their assignment to kill a lich who enslaved the neighboring kingdom, they proceeded to go to the town slums and attack one of the patrolling guards. They were laying down a beating on him pretty hard, and in my frustration I brought in two more patrols, one of which ran off to warn the city guard. They finished off the first guard, where Gashrock tried to loot his body, finding little to nothing. Realizing this was a mistake, he tried to run away but was surrounded by 20 of the peasants, who had enough of him and were charging at him. My friend asked me if he could swing his great axe around to hit them all. I said sure, but he'd have to roll two d20s (one for grip on the axe and one for successfully spinning around) and a d12 for damage. Both d20s were above 15, and the peasants only had 5 health each, while he rolled a 10. After slaughtering dozens of peasants, he ran to a nearby house to hide/pillage, finding nothing yet again. He and another of the PCs stumbled around inside the house for a time before the guards began slashing at the house, to the point where it nearly collapses on them. They managed to run out of them slums to a neighboring farm. They hear the sound of hoofbeats and attempt to hide behind a rock. Gashrock rolled a 1, tripping and falling onto his companion, knocking themselves out. While the other PC smooth-talked his way out of a sentence at all, Gashrock was sentenced for execution. We left off with an interesting jailbreak which I won't go into much detail here, since it's quite silly.",

        "text": "This was a campaign from a few years ago, and some of the details are a bit fuzzy.\n\nThen Eduardo, that roguish devil, unlaces his breeches and...\n\nWait, I'll back up.\n\nThe large coastal town of whereverthehell, let's call it Cremin, has been plagued by unrest recently, but the biggest indicator of trouble came when a small mercenary crew had to help off a tide of about forty aquatic goblins or some such menace. They swarmed up over the docks and sprayed this truly icky goo when they died. It was only by the brave actions of Eduardo the Rogue and his Other, Lesser Companions that this tiny smelly horde was stopped. \n\nBecause Eduardo liked this city, he went along when his other, lesser companions decided to investigate the island far out in the bay - the one that currently appears to be smoking. We make some deals with the local city rulers wherein we go over there and if it stops sending fish-monsters at the citizens, we get the credit for making that happen and the rewards that come with a good day's murderhoboing. \n\nWe sail over to the island, and the dwarfier of our companions spends the whole time complaining about the lack of solid stone under her boots, and cut, burn, arrow, and other standard methods of advance our way up the beach, to where we find a summoning circle. \n\n*It is at this point I must cut away from the action to mention the method by which our DM began to draw the summoning circle on our map. He picked a square that was the center and began counting distances to the outer ring - it was a big summoning circle. However, because of the way D&amp;D4 tries to simplify distance, that summoning circle winds up being a square. A circle, being defined by a shape where every point along the perimeter is equidistant from a center point, winds up being square in D&amp;D4E. As such, the value of Pi in Greyhawk, being the circumference of a circle divided by its diameter, is equal to 4. We spend a good ten minutes thinking about the implications of this.*\n\nOnce Eduardo and his other, lesser companions found their world resuming motion once more, they watched several fish-monsters pop out of the summoning circle and begin to attack. After dispatching them via several inventive means, including using all the fun mobility powers to knock them off cliffs and whatnot, we have a chance to examine the circle.\n\nSomeone I believe a tiefling, ventures that the runes and sigils around the circumference appear to open a gateway to the quasi-elemental plane of Murk, somewhere on the border of Water and Darkness. Nobody really knows how to shut it off, either, but Edquardo, being the smartest in addition to the most handsome and daring of the brave companions comes up with a plan. Clearly, the sigils are how one calls up a plane and location. Therefore, change the sigils and there's a good chance they'll become garbage and sever the link. The only problem is, there may be a backlash of power which could injure anyone close enough to scrub out the symbols. \n\nThere's a ledge nearby, and Eduardo climbs it and stands atop it, maybe ten feet above the ground that the circle is chalked upon. Far enough above the circle to avoid the sowrst of the likely burst, but also too far to srub off any symbols. Then Eduardo, that roguish devil, unlaces his breeches and pees on the circle, washing away sigils at random.\n\nIt was such a good plan until the resulting gout of fire leaps straight up and fills Eduardo's nose with the scent of singed hair, and a *truly incredibly pissed-off* dwarf made of living fire storms out of the circle and demands to know why a summoning circle to some shitty not-even-on-fire island opened up in his living room.\n\nAnd that, my friends, is why you always arc your shot.",

We go to the kitchen and suddenly!...\n\nDM: roll for dodge\n\nWe roll, everyone fails, and are hit by needles\n\nDM: fantastic! Roll fortitude. \n\nWe all pass but we're pretty freaked out by this mystery poison. \n\nThe pugwampis are hiding in the large kitchen cabinet area and use them as cover while we try to get to them. So while the Druid and the monk are trying to kill this little fuckers and traverse the old kitchen of broken crockery the gunslinger and Garrus the fighter begin to work out a plan to finish this quickly. By stuffing his powder horn into the neck of a oil container (Garrus loves his fire!) Garrus will ferry the oil to its destination by throwing it and the gunslinger will then shoot it creating a large Pugwampi killing explosion.\n\nSo Garrus runs in, goes to throw (you see where this is going), and I rolled a 5 so he throws the makeshift bomb behind myself :( instead.\n\nSo our gunslinger sighs and nails one to the wall while the monk goes nuts and punches the shit out of tiny sprite creatures. He hits two of them four times each and splatter faces both of them in a flurry of Jacky Chanesque fighting. I then move in and redeem myself with some damage.\n\nWhile the Druid and Garrus the fighter play whack a mole with the last one the gunslinger and the Monk make their way to a nearby room that reeks of fur and unopened treasure boxes. After some very healthy searching we discovered nothing of value and moved on to....\n\nThe library -_-\n\nThe place reeked of old books and fire fuel. Garrus wanted to set the place on fire but after finding a book that talks about genies he was again denied. This didn't stop him from lighting a torch and angry walking around kicking things over looking for pungwampis or paper golems or some bullshit. Ryan the gunslinger then got in a big fight with the DM over the existence of secret doors in a library (Ryan: there are ALWAYS secret doors in a library!) and succeeded in clearing the monastery (not with fire :( )\n\nThen we return to the caravan to talk to Almah AKA THE Hot Bitch. We are awarded mad xp for our trouble and we succeeded in giving the caravan people a new home :).\n\nGarrus however opted to set up his tent outside though since he will never trust buildings again.\n\nStay tuned next week when we might actually see some real action.",

Experiencing many things and meeting many kind people. Soon enough they find a caravan to travel with and do so. They are paid 100 gold a day for this. to protect the goods of the caravan from many a danger. It is hard work but they get many good things out of it. With this caravan they learn many things and gain many treasures. They learn of the existence of technology, a strange new magic based on natural philosophy and alchemy. Created by \"scientists.\" They learn that the king has outlawed all Science and made it punishable by death. But still underground (literally) technology exists, along with all the benefits it brings. In the city of Darum there is a hidden staircase, Deep in a small alley curving and twisting behind many buildings. This staircase, though open is highly guarded by specialized equipment. Upon entering you find the underground cavernous city of \"Dark Darum\" A city of technology and magic intertwined. With this the pair learn that her father was doing much more than just giving very little care to the workings of the world he presided over, he was stopping perfectly sound progress to make life better and easier on all. Cures for diseases magic could not touch. Advancements for cripples who could not be cured. Ability to reach the stars themselves! \n\nOver the next many weeks She encountered people who called her \"Fairy queen\" for a long time she knew not why. But eventually through luck and perseverance she encoutnered an old and rather eccentric mage who could see the elusive fairies. She learned that fairies are actually an invisible particle taking different shapes and forms that most people could not percieve. These fairies were the literal energy flow of the universe and a parody of it's will. She asked the man why he called her fairy queen, and he replied. \"Because they love you. they love you so.\"\n\n  Soon they must part ways with the caravan when eventually they reach a dragon. After showing the caravan she can negotiate with a dragon they inform them they must stay. The caravan moves on. By this time the two have heard of the terrible things her father is doing, as stated before, and they wish for the dragons help. The dragon agrees to help, only if they can protect his precious store of books, scrolls and other forms of knowledge. A lengthy ritual ensues. Costing them much gold and enchanted items as well as five straight days with no sleep. They are in fact able to permanently secure the dragons tidy horde. and make sure they never fall into the wrong hands. The only problem with this is the ritual they used conjured a tower. Not juts a regular tower though. This tower rose thousands of feet into the air. In a stroke of genius Titania pulls out the magical expanding bung, a magic bung meant to fit all holes. She throws it up  into the air and it expands until it's large enough for them to safely use as an elevator down. Soon they are back on the road.\n\n They travel on in their magic wagon, pushing the horses as fast as possible without killing them. They reach the next city having picked up a child who was previously enslaved, Rya smashing her captors into mush and banishing the mayor who let slavery run free, to the astral planes.\n\nOur protagonists are now out to kill Titanias father. Titania believes he is a terrible ruler and needs to be stopped, with slavery, bandits, thieves and every other kinds of ridiculous crime rampaging across the main continent and beyond he needs to be destroyed. She and Ryashnre have begun gathering an army to siege the great walled merchant city Leore. The same city she worked so hard to escape from before. Her power and Ryas grow greater by the day. creating and crafting new items and weapons. Learning and changing, having even enlisting the help of a friendly dragon to fight for them. Millions hear rumours of her, the fairy queen, a beautiful young lady garbed in pink, whose words carry magic across the land, and can even command a dragon. But darker rumours flood the land as well, rumours of her dog, an elf dressed in black who fights with nothing but a pair of gauntlets and scale armour. It is said the man cares not for his foes and will turn them all into mush if he has a chance. This is how great his love is for his master, the queen. He is known as the black dog of the fairies.\n\nThey now go to the Leore colony city of Sassurine. A large port city rich and full of life. But also full of crime, and not just simple crime. Rape, murder, massive theft, slavery, everything you can think of all hidden just beneath the surface. Anything not human in Leore colonies is considered fair game for a slave and treated as lesser. \n\n After listening in to a few conversation in the black wrack, a tavern for mercenaries and folk of not exactly clean backgrounds. \n\nWhat she heard startled her. She had suspected something similar to be going on but never to this extent. her father was offering 3 million gold for Titania, the fairy queen, alive. An extra million for the head of her lover ryashnre, the rabid Dog of the Fairy queen. Not to long after this Titania ran into a half giant and a few troublemaker tryign to capture her. Rya had been following her so easily dispatches the humans and elves in the group. Turning around he faces the half giant. Unbeknownst to the giant, Rya is versed in the magycks of Eiga, and able to use this to his advantage, as all giants are severely weak to any type of magyck. He dispatches of the half giant with a few deft moves and some minor broken bones. Throwing himself in harms way he takes headshot after headshot of fireballs at the giant. Knowing that this was a giants weakest point he was dealing x8 damage to the half giant. x4 for the weakness to magic, and x2 for the critical weakness of it's head. Soon the half giant fell. It spoke to rya then. Telling his tale, the king had ordered giants hunted as beasts are hunted, despite their generally peaceful and gentle nature. His mother a giant and father a mage human, who had figured out how to maek a son with his wife using magic, were both killed as traitors to the kingdom. only he had gotten away. The king he had hoped would change his mind about giants if one had brought him his precious daughter. \n\nRya cried then, speaking thus, \"I am sorry my friend, you were by far a worthy foe, You simply fought the wrong man, over the wrong prize. Those who attempt to harm the fairy queen, get the Teeth of her trained wolf.\" at this moment he fell to his knees in front of the giant. Tears running down his face. \"What is your name?\" The giant answered simply with ruk (Rook) and asked that the elf take Ruks axe with him. To remember this battle by. Rya agrees, and with a final rattling and coughing breath, the giant dies. Rya, soon healed, resolved to kill the king once and for all. Not just for his own personal vendetta, for he had and still does have a grudge against the man, but for those others that have also suffered at this disgusting kings hand. \n\nAt this they recruited the helping hands of a smith nearby and left immediately leaving behind the Leore spies.\n\nThey made their way east, to find the caravan they had been traveling with, So as to gain the protection and strength of such a strong group. The caravan also knew a way to get to leore without once touching the ocean, as Leore was an island magically brought forth in the farthest reaches of the ocean.\n\nBut to get to the caravan they have land to cross. Dangerous land. They will be crossign the infamous telmari heat plains very soon. covered in parched land and pits of lava. What have our two protagonists come up with for this? Simple, they sacrifice an abundance of items and magic and gold to use a permanent ritual to create a perfect alarm system that will attack all those with malintent. After that rya took a staff of the flame atronach (fire immunity, cool aura, and lava walking) and  forged it into their magic wagon. This is all they can do and hope they can get through the plains. Legend has it that a man walkign alone with no magic would burst into flames within minutes in these plains. Will the homemade enchantment hold up and keep the wagon from burning? If it can't they will all be trapped in nil-space for eternity. Unable to leave and unable to age, forced to an eternity of stagnation and likely starvation. Not to mention their adopted daughter. They would have nothing of that happen to her. They have to get through this. They can't afford to think about what will happen if they don't.\n\n[World Map](http://i.imgur.com/qG9Robp.jpg)\n\n\n[Mad King](http://i.imgur.com/w7Zzrkp.jpg)",

        "text": "[More tales from the underground!](http://redd.it/3fkzdd) It's a very special day for [Bullmime the avant garde artist](http://i.imgur.com/GPR6sZx.png)- specifically, her birthday! She awoke from her pleasant home in the restroom of a ninja burger to find that people were [throwing a ninja party for her!](http://i.imgur.com/ksSzgMB.png) (like a regular party, but with more nunchucks)\n\nBut alas, the mood was spoiled by [a mysterious stranger](http://i.imgur.com/OHxauW2.png), who insisted that Bullmime and her friends come to The Underground to see to some dire events! Oh my. Thus, Bullmime put out the call for her trusted companions to assemble! BEHOLD!\n\n* Landlady, the unhinged property owner with the power of charisma!\n* Squidalibre, the wolf-squid-borg with the power of hitting things!\n* Denial, the observant man with the power of boring!\n* Bullmime herself, the bulky artist with the power of being rather strange!\n\nAnd also Medstudent, the broke and unemployed not-sociopath with the power of attacking his friends with hypodermic needles. No, we're never going to let you live that down. But he got Bullmime a pet ocelot for her birthday so he got invited too.\n\nThe ~~avengers~~ party assembled at the meeting spot, running into their mysterious contact almost immediately. He was a lot more red than he had been last time. Also he was dripping. The mysterious man said that he was a kickass ninja of the ninja mafia, but now weird shit was happening and he wanted someone with a brain to look into it so that he didn't have to. Something about demonic possession blah blah blah why don't you go hunt for clues or whatever. Here, have this magnifying glass, that always helps.\n\nThey did not need a magnifying glass. Around the corner, their \"evidence\" turned out to be a charnel house of dead ninjas, all of whom were seriously overdrawn at the blood bank. [Different people](http://i.imgur.com/sCOKa8K.jpg) had [different reactions](http://i.imgur.com/W41APnD.png), like when [Landlady started laughing in a distinctly unsettling manner](http://i.imgur.com/6vx8xAI.jpg). [Bullmime had other priorities](http://imgur.com/7E0X3Q6) which were nearly as disturbing. Eventually, though, Denial forced down his primal terror long enough to say that these ninjas were not normal, because they were all wearing icepacks and stuff. Plus the tattoos saying \"SATAN WUZ HEER\".\n\nTheir suspicions were confirmed with Landlady's shout of \"IT'S DEMONS\". The party expressed various emotions, from the dread of Denial, the curiosity of Bullmime, the cackling glee of Landlady, the crying of Medstudent, and the rampant enthusiasm of Squidalibre^^'s ^^boner . The party set out to follow their only real lead, that of the ice packs the ninjas had been wearing. To the coolant factory!\n\nAfter [thorough decontamination](http://i.imgur.com/9gSayb5.png), the party used various means to convince the factory workers that they were there on IMPORTANT BUSINESS, also we have a ninja who will decapitate you if you don't let us in. Thus the group discovered that the demonic ninjas would be back that very night, to pick up a huge shipment of ice packs and freon. Time to set up one HELL of an ambush!\n\nMysterious ninja was parked in the roof of the main warehouse, while everyone else set about doing more inane things. Landlady was given a gun (which, in retrospect, was probably extremely unwise), everyone else was given more conventional weaponry, and it was stressed that these demons were very susceptible to heat, so Medstudent whipped up some molotov cocktails. Bullmime contributed by constructing a trojan cat and hiding Medstudent inside. And at the last moment, Landlady nipped off to pick up something.\n\nThe ninjas arrived, and the trap was sprung! The demonic ninjas milled around, loudly demanding to know why the hell they had ordered coolant and recieved a wooden cat, when the sinister group was blown to bits by a rocket fired by the party's ninja friend. SHIT WAS ON NOW! Squidalibre descended upon them like a noodly storm, lashing out left and right with his ninja-sword-stuck-in-a-pool-noodle. Denial took the advantage and shot one of the ailing ninjas, killing him!\n\nThat was when Denial was suddenly accosted by an infuriated demon trying to take over his mind. Because, oh yeah, that was a thing. Then Denial lived up to his name, banishing the demon by denying its existence so hard it was nearly bored to death. Over by Squidalibre, events were starting to turn for the worse- there were just too many demons! Bullmime and Denial were too far away to assist!\n\n[So instead they shoved the Trojan Cat right into the fighting mob](http://i.imgur.com/2UAW7By.jpg), breaking a few legs of demon ninjas who were too wounded or distracted to move away. Medstudent, inside the cat, started hurling molotovs at the injured ninjas, leaving them burning alive while screaming in demonic agony. It still wasn't enough, though, Squidalibre was one hit away from being taken down and out!\n\nWhich is why it was fortunate that Landlady returned at just that moment, holding a gun loaded with antifreeze-covered bullets. BANG, now the odds were in the party's favor! Aside from the part where the loose demon took over Bullmime's mind and tried to attack her friends, only to crit fail the roll and fall on her face. Denial and Landlady mopped up the remaining demon ninjas, and then cured Bullmime by hucking antifreeze in her face until she stopped snarling.\n\nVictory achieved! Mysterious ninja congratulated the party on a job well done, and then went on to grimly state that the demons were still around... one had entered the mind of the ninja emperor, and so Mysteryninja had defected to defy the hellish threat. Something would need to be done about the nefarious demon ninja emperor...!\n\nBut whatever someone else would probably take care of it. Mysteryninja gave his secret ninja number to the party and told them to call if they ever needed military-grade combat support. High fives all around, best birthday ever! Oop, Landlady's stopped cackling and started twitching again. Aaand Denial's [gone fetal](http://i.imgur.com/cCbV2ul.png). Well, can't make an omelette without cracking a few sanity's.",

Who's coming? Check the guest list!\n\n* [Bullmime, avant garde human artist](http://i.imgur.com/GPR6sZx.png)\n* [Lupusexpress, wolf delivery girl](http://i.imgur.com/uTafvow.png)\n* [Denial, *perfectly ordinary human*](http://i.imgur.com/1aw8O5g.jpg)\n* [Landlady, might be going crazy](http://i.imgur.com/4Pax9qT.jpg)\n* [Medstudent, reformed-ish psychopath](http://i.imgur.com/3kTnmpb.png)\n\nThey were being brought into the light of the silver screen by a bunch of Denial's *perfectly ordinary friends*, who for some reason were quarantined underground forever. By a shady government thing that does not tolerate weirdos. *I'M SURE IT'S JUST A CLERICAL ERROR.*\n\nIt was not a clerical error. Denial's friends, whom he had known for years, turned out to be shapeshifting slug-people. Who were LARPers using Denial as a sort of role model, assuming that anyone so aggressively boring had to be putting on an act.\n\n[Denial? Buddy? You okay? Why are you twitching?](http://i.imgur.com/54IS8Hf.jpg) And why is landlady laughing?\n\nWell thankfully something happened to distract all of them. [A talking gerbil](http://i.imgur.com/iBXkNgl.png) sidled up to the party and asked them if they wouldn't mind doing some... work for her.\n\nThe crew had experience with gerbils. Mostly this consisted of [fast food robberies and vehicular homicide](http://redd.it/36vu28). Gerbilcide? Anyway. The point was, if the party was to *remove* some high-ranking gerbil gangsters, everyone would think they're acting out of their own anti-gerbil hatred, thus leaving the way clear for someone with revolutionary ideas to take charge! Someone who would pay them hundreds of dollars. Did I not mention that? Pretty important.\n\nAnd then medstudent tripped on the sidewalk on the way out and received a compound fracture on both his ankles. Nobody commented on this. Or stopped to help.\n\nThe party had four targets, one of which was just down the block. Figuring it would be good to start right away, the party charged over, with no plan whatsoever. Thinking quickly, Lupusexpress decided to SEDUCE the kingpin gerbil (who was running a smuggling ring) by talking very pointedly about a \"package\" that had to be \"handled\".\n\nHe was quite disappointed when this \"package\" turned out to be the dying Medstudent.\n\nBullmime, meanwhile, was PISSED. She was NOT in on the plan. And she MIGHT have a secret crush on Lupusexpress. Thus, in her usual overblown manner, she chased the gerbil kingpin into a dumpster, stole a garbage truck, and compacted the little bastard.\n\nWell, that was one down.\n\nNext was a gerbil fatass. That was his thing. He was a fatass. The party decided that the way to proceed was to have Landlady dress as a girl scout, leave a trail of cookies, then pounce from above and wrap the idiot in packing tape. The fatass fell for it, except that he had brought a couple of guards... and Lupusexpress, the one doing the taping, had crit failed her roll and cocooned herself in tape. PLAN B: BULLMIME PUNCHES STUFF\n\nBullmime actually managed to talk the guard gerbils down, just as Landlady got a crit-fail on an attack roll and tripped facefirst onto the pavement. The fatass was handed over to the party, packed up with some (very hairy) tape, and shipped off to Siberia. Two down!\n\nNext was the irish gerbil. Landlady assured the party that she had this one, and challenged the tiny overdone stereotype to a drinking contest. To just about everyone's surprise, it was a tie, and Landlady staggered out of the bar right beside the inebriated gerbil. Lupusexpress used a bit of sleight of hand to stick him in a box and send him back to his boozy homeland. Supposedly. The irish bit was probably just some horrible act or gimmick to give the guy personality. Whatever, three down!\n\nLast bot not least was a gerbil that thought with his fists. Or claws, teeth, whatever. Thug gerbil was the last on the list, and the party didn't want any sort of confrontation with him, so...\n\nThey walked straight into his hideout, asked for him, found him winning a knife-fight, and asked him if he'd ever heard of the roman colosseum.\n\n\"Yeah, it's awesome! Eveyone's heard of it! You think you'll be the champ if you push around the gerbil gang? Win fights in this arena and you'll be recognized as the strongest gerbil alive, in all the world!\"\n\n\"...Where is this arena?\"\n\n\"We can send you there! No charge!\"\n\nIt was a win for everyone. The assholes vying for the top were all gone, and the party had made some serious cash in doing so. Also a new gerbil friend, with connections! Everything was looking great for everyone! Except for medstudent, who was now once again in crippling medical debt. So yes, great for everyone!",

If only you could duck in somewhere and set up an ambush.*\n\nThey burst into the cantina.\n*You only have a moment to hide or blend in before Teemo's thugs arrive!*\n\nWekk the Trandoshan  hops over the counter and hid behind the bar, motioning to the old Devaronian bartender that he needs to keep quiet, or else.\n\nPash the Smuggler strolls over to the stage dancer and asks if they can \"go in the back.\" She takes him backstage.\n\nRipper the Slicer runs up the wall and pulls himself into a storage space in the rafters.\n\nOskara the Bounty Hunter runs across the room, vaults off a table, and swings herself into the rafters.\n\nLowhhrick the Wookiee says \"fuck hiding!\" He bulldozes a path to the center of the room, overturning tables and shoving patrons. He stands ready with vibroaxe in hand. \n\nSasha the Explasha grabs a mop bucket and dumps soapy water on a spot between the door and the Wookiee, then ducks in a booth.\n\nFour ugly Gammoreans burst into the room carrying beating sticks. Watch your kneecaps fellas, these guys mean business. Behind them are three Aqualish thugs armed with blasters.\nThe Gammoreans see the Wookiee, (Lowhhrick: \"Come at me bro!\") and charge!\n\nThe Gammoreans charge the Wookiee. The first two slip and slide on their asses. The second two make it over the puddle to the Wookiee and whack him in the knee. (No damage.)\n\nLowhhrick whirls his axe and cuts down the shin whackers before overhand throwing his axe and implanting it in the skull of another Gammorean as it tries to get up off the floor. (Dealt enough damage to kill two minions, plus a crit to kill a third.)\n\nPash hears a commotion and steps out from backstage wearing no pants. He glances at the situation and see's Ripper in the storage rafters. Being kind off an ass and not caring if he messes up Ripper, he fires off a shot and dislodges storage crates. Boxes fall on the Aqualish thugs but they avoid getting hurt. However, this must have been where the bartender kept all his life day decorations because broken ornaments now litter the ground. Pash then returns to what he was doing backstage. (No damage, just advantages)\n\nRipper drops from his ambush position and sweeps the legs of two Aqualish. (No damage, just advantages)\n\nThe Trandoshan pops out from behind the counter and throws bolas at one of the Aqualish, ensnaring him in place.\n\nAbandoning their ensnared friend, the two downed Aqualish jump up and bolt for the door, stumbling and tripping on life day ornaments.\n\nOskara swings down from the rafters and hangs from her legs like a bat. She spends the extra effort lining up her shot and blows holes through both Aqualish before they make it out the door. (Success and an advantage, which was used to be badass)\n\nSasha springs from her position and slides across the slippery floor into a prone position and headshots the only standing Aqualish. (Success and one advantage, which was used to be badass)\n\nThe remaining Gammorean springs up, whacks Lowhhrick, and takes off running. Only to slip and fall again on the wet floor.\n\nLowhhrick stomps on his axe, kicking it off the ground and into his hand. Then he saunters over to the last Gammorean. With his axe in one hand and his balls in the other he lops off its head.\n\n*The patrons in the booths start a slow amused clap.*\n\n\nPash's player (my brother who has never played an rpg before) comments on all the slipping and tripping going on, \"this is kind of a slapstick game.\" \n\nYeah, that wasn't the intention, but it ended up setting a good tone for the night. \n\n\nEverything changed when they split the party.",

        "text": "Leaving the Barron on the bridge I lead my Lord back to the meeting room.  I dismiss all the staff inside, with only the guards stationed outside the soundproof heavy doors.  My Lord takes his usual place at the head of the table, refilling his near-empty glass, as I approach my own seat at his right hand and wait for him to finish pouring his drink.\n\n\"Sir, as things currently stand, I fear it would be impossible to successfully place a warrant onto Fell.\"  I explain what I have learned about Fell's connection to the Inquisition; how he is responsible for it's presence aboard the ship.\n\n\"I see...\"  My Lord places his glass to one side.  \"Still, all is not lost.  This uncovered corruption could be the very fuel we need to stop not only Fell, but this so-called Inquisitor too!\"\n\n\"You could be right.\"  I lean forward resting my elbows on the table, hands clutched together supporting the weight of my head, thinking.  \"But it is still only our word against theirs.  We will need proof, and credible witnesses.\"\n\n\"It's a shame we couldn't sway that Psyker guy.\"  My Lord looks back at me, smirking.\n\n\"Yes.\"  I return the expression, sliding my glasses back up my nose.  \"It is a shame the witch cult killed him before he could cooperate with you.  A good thing you did putting that monster down sir.  It was dangerous for someone like me to even survey.\"\n\n\"You're a delicate flower Kaleb.\"  My Lord pats my shoulder, pulling it down in a sign of camaraderie.  \"I take it you have a plan to get aforementioned witness?\"\n\n\"Somewhat sir, yes.\"  I move my hands away from my face, returning to business.  I tell him about the last known Inquisition spy - Tanlon - and my intentions for him.  \"Fell believes he has already won.  No doubt he thinks it impossible for us to uncover all his schemes.  He won't query the intelligence he receives.\"\n\nMy Lord smiles.  \"A fine idea Kaleb.\"\n\n\"Thank you sir.  Although,\" I fold my arms, \"in order to have a witness, the Acolyte will have to survive the questioning.  Do you understand what I mean by that?\"\n\n\"Yes...\" he hangs his head like a scolded toddler.  \"No spacing.\"  This is how my Lord refers to the act of flushing men into the void.  Not many have been spared from this fate when he leads the 'interrogations'.  Composing himself once more, he looks up.  \"Should we send for the others now?\"\n\nI think it's time to bring them up to speed.  \"Would you like them to know everything sir?\"\n\n\"I'll leave that up to you.\"  My Lord picks up his glass and heads to his selection of vintage bottles.  I contact the other seniors via comms, calling them into the room.  They file in one by one; first Court, Zez and finally Odette.  I look back at my Lord, waiting for him to start, only to find he is starring at me in a similar fashion.  It looks as if this is all down to me.  Rising from my seat, I address the room.\n\n\"Thank you all for coming.  As you are well aware, we have uncovered the presence of spies working for Trader Hadarack Fell in the lower decks.  I'm afraid I have more bad news.\"  Court eyes me listening, while the other two start zoning out.  In spite of this, I carry on.  \"Thanks to the diligence of our dear Navigator - \" Odette sites up like a child pretending they were paying attention, \"- we uncovered some suspicious individuals down there.\"  I explain the situation with the cult member, Imperial Psyker and my Lord, using the excuse I outlined earlier.  Court would be wary if he knew we flushed a member of the Inquisition for no reason, being a man of unshakable faith.  Since we are spreading a slightly edited tale of events, better they only know the version we want to be spread.\n\n\"Because we were unable to gather answers there, I sought them elsewhere.\"  I highlight the key points brought up by the Adept, ending in an 'unfortunate scuffle' that sadly couldn't be avoided.  \"I believe our best course of action would be to feed them a false plan.\"  I turn to Zez, who takes a moment to realise my attention is focused in her direction.  \"The spy is one of your men.\"  She looks very concerned.\n\nOdette mumbles under her breath, \"Didn't see that one coming...\"\n\nI turn to my Lord, who is still content to sit back and listen.  Tucking in my seat, I begin to pace around the board table.\n\n\"I have an idea for a plan.\"  I look from one of my colleagues to another.  \"We will lay two traps.  One will be a decoy, meant for Fell's spies to overhear and leek back to him; the other our actual method of snaring him.\"  We has planned that if it transpired that Fell was following our movements we would leave him a little something: explosives connected to motion sensors.  He would never suspect that he was walking straight into our trap.  My Lord's ideas of placing a warrant upon Fell would obviously not suit this premeditated plan well, although I feel that it might not necessarily matter in this case.  In death we can still smear his name and reap the benefits of uncovering his secrets and lies.  This means the other idea - the false trap should partly compliment our real intentions to bait Fell into tripping the sensors.  That way we would not even need to risk a confrontation with him to destroy him.\n\n\"I suggest you tell your engineers Zez that we are building a cloaking device, hiding the room with the most valuable treasure because we simply cannot carry it all.  It will create an illusion of emptiness, but when you pass through the false image you'll see what lies behind for what it truly is.  We will find a sizable space and chose that as our location.  Is this something that would be conceivable to build?\"\n\nAll eyes fall on Zez, obviously making the Explorator uncomfortable.  She stares down at her hands as she speaks.\n\n\"Yes.  But I'm not very good at lying.  It would be easier if I just built it.\"\n\nNot the response I was expecting exactly, but then again with Zez is never quite is.  \"Will it interfere with your role in setting up the sensors?\"\n\nShe looks up at the ceiling for a second, considering this.  \"No.\"\n\n\"Then by all means, do what you feel is best.\"  As long as she is aware that this extra credit project of hers will be blown away with Fell and his crew, then she is free to make the cover story as convincing as she pleases.\n\n\"Does anyone have any objections to this?\"  I pose the question to the table.\n\nCourt is the first to speak.  \"So, we plant sensors inside the Righteous Path after we're finished exploring, then spread rumours of a disguised room that we are waiting to return to later.  What do we do in the meantime?\"\n\nI think on this.  \"Zez, do you know your engineers by name?\"  She slowly shakes her head.  This isn't too surprising.  Zez tends to minimize interactions between anything and anyone that isn't majority machine.  \"Then I will have to locate Tanon.\"  Quickly calling the Barron over comms, I check to see how much time there is before we're due to arrive at the Righteous Path.  Consulting with him proves that we are merely hours away now.  \"Odette, you and I will need to try and delay our arrival to give Zez more time.  Before then, we should go to the lower decks and gather anyone who was deemed suspicious by your hunters.  We can question them upon our return.\"\n\n\"What should I do?\"  My Lord sits up, leaving his chin against the back of his hand covering the wineglass.\n\n\"You sir - you do whatever it is you do before an expedition.  Prepare to lead us when we take on the Righteous Path herself.\"  I assume that the usual ritual of drink and merriment will be in effect.  Meanwhile, there are many tasks for me to set in order.  \"Does this sound acceptable to everyone?\"  They all nod.  \"Well, we all know what we're doing.  Let's get to work.\"\n\n[Start](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3dfr45/tales_from_a_seneschal_rogue_trader/) | [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3el7xa/tales_from_a_seneschal_part_3_rogue_trader/) | [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3ghdp7/tales_from_a_seneschal_part_5_rogue_trader/) | [Last](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3i4hxx/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_6/)",

This was a good thing, because Humanity's Extraterrestrial Colonies would have collapsed under the weight of that many Morphs. They practically did over the relatively small numbers of Morphs that were evacuated.\n\nIn the wake of that, as humans are wont to do, they quarreled, the inner system coalescing around Hypercapitalism, the outer system around a menagerie  of Anarchist/Socialist worldviews, and Jupiter... Well, officially a Republic, really a Junta. Nobody likes Jupiter, particularly as they're the only Anti-Trans-humanist views in the setting.\n\nIn the Aftermarth of 'The Fall' as it was known, a network of Kill-Sats sprung up around Earth, with... Odd programming. No one knows what the programming is (or who put them there) but they seem to have worked After all, everyone else isn't dead.\n\nIn addition, 'Firewall' appeared. Firewall is a Conspiracy Theory in the flesh, but, fortunately, with a good goal: Identify, locate, and neutralise Existential Threats to Transhumanity. It's very cellular, with various internal factions and differing viewpoints between cells. In a typical Eclipse Phase Campaign (such as this one) The Player Characters take on the mantles of Firewall 'Sentinels' basically Investigators, who receive orders from their 'Proxy'.\n\n---\n\n    From: Sabah née Titan (Property of J.

Our Character's Home Base is Vo Nguyen, a Station in the Lunar-Lagrange Alliance (a second rate, unstable Hypercapitalist power.) Under Vo Nguyen law, AGI's aren't people, and, are, in fact, property. Hence my Character, under local law, if officially the property of the other PC.\n\n---\n\n    From: [[Error: No Sender Found]]\n    To: Sabah née Titan (Property of J.

I'm Sabah, one of the Sentinels. I was born in a Titanian Server Rack, raised by one of the researchers at the Foundation I was born in, and when she died (offed herself, deleting back-ups) I did the fucking stupid thing, and I only survived because she did Firewall on the Sly and her contact pulled me out of the Fire. Well, me and the fucked-up thing I call a Fork^^1. Sorry, Erasure guys, that's my fault. In my defense, I can't use a stack properly, and Back-up is a Literal Pain, so I'm not all.. Roses? For me either.\n\n[Meta Corner]: 1: A Fork is a copy of an Ego. Initially, they're exactly the same, and up to a certain point Forks can be easily integrated into the main Ego without too much trouble. Up to a certain point, let alone trying to intergrate an entirely seperate person\n\nYou work with fucking strange people in Firewall. I mean, I take my orders from an Ape in a Lab-Coat in Simulspace. And who does he pair me with? A literal Hypercorp Poster-Girl. Watch Crop Feeds long enough (I know, I know, but getting anything past Jupiter is difficult where we are) and you'll see her face at some people. Not that she likes using it. She's scared of Re-Sleeving, so she used a Battlesuit. Because, apparently, Reaper Morphs just don't cut it.\n\n    Cut my description out of it.\n\nI mean, it's likely the same for her. I'm an Emergent Uplift AGI in a Modded-to-the-(metaphorical)-Gills Dragonfly Morph with a Penchant for Rail Pistols (Heavy, of course.)\n\nAnyway, not the first time I've gone out with Poster-Girl. We did an Op grabbing the stack of some professor from a Station wrecked Mid-Fall. Found the time to recover some stacks (Include Morteza Bay's! Hi!) and the Station's Controlling Intelligence Cores. I have this theory on the emergence of Sub-Sentience Intelligent Systems...\n\n    Cut Bay out of that.\n\n    You did what? Well, Vo Nyugen isn't an Exsurgent Infested Bomb Site, so no actual harm. I presume you were *very* careful, given you didn't inform me At all.\n\n    As for everything that went after that, all thousands upon thousands of words on it? Send it to the Argonauts. Cut it from this, not enough people will care or even understand.\n\nIn any case, we had a new task: Track down a missing Antimatter Bomb, with a Quantum Entanglement Trigger. To cut a long story short (drudge work, mostly) we found that this 'Titanian Union of Christian Engineers' (not many Christians on Titan, let me assure you) had taken it. We found a Pilot who had conveyed them, who Poster-Girl got on side (not just this, but more long term) by clearing her up with the 'Corps (not everyone's gonna take the jump I guess.) \n\nGet this: They jumped out mid way. With the Bomb. Had her shuttle fixed on course, and they just began floated away on their schedule.\n\nTo, as it turned out, the Kilimanjaro Space Elevator Anchor Station in Geosync. We purchased Guardian Swarms, which is mostly as effective as throwing a grenade into a gale (trust me on this.) But still. Orders were orders, Job was a job.\n\nWe were likely headed down to Earth. Back-up safe before hand! We were also handed a QEC (Quantum Entanglement Communicator) to keep in touch with our Proxy.\n\nWe got to the Anchor Station same way our predecessors did: Floating. Boy, I love Cosmic Radiation Damage to my internals!\n\nBoy, I love having downloaded a Earth-Orbit-Object map, and knowing exactly where the Kill-Sats were, and not knowing if they were about to vaporize us!\n\nBoy, I loved that the Anchor Station had functioning Drones to shoot at us! Boy, I love gunshot damage!\n\nAnd top it all off, there was an Exsurgent-Infected Reaper Morph in the Departure Lounge.\n\nLet me break that down for you:\n\n* Reaper Morph: Single Purpose Killing Machine\n* Exsurgent Virus: Extraordinarily dangerous, also very good at killing!\n* Both combined: Oh-Non-Existant-God!\n\nSo we ran away. Fortunately, I'm good enough at Infosec that we could run away, down the Space Elevator, on a somehow still functioning Carriage. I was able to chuck the thing out the systems. Likely wasn't a hacking Exsurge, so I was just fighting off the Reaper's Combat suite. Fortunately\n\nWith a portable plane. The portable plane is important because, many hours later (which I mostly spent Hole-Patching. I was bored) we were able to spot a Sealed Bunker, 50-100 miles from the Base Station.\n\nNot that we had *any* intention of actually reaching the base station. 7500M above the surface was easily enough for us. Assembling the Plane was...Interesting. (Had to be done with the Wings on the vertical, so at first you've have to rotate it 90 degrees before actually getting lift.\n\nNot to worry, Poster-Girl had done it in a movie once. Well, a Stunt Double had. Surprisingly, she managed it.\n\nUnsurprisingly, I trusted my own wings. Because, despite everything. I get to say:\n\n\"I flew on Earth post fall.\"\n\nWell, I do. Most people won't believe me, but I did. Wow.\n\nSo, in any case, we were... Unmolested on the journey. Glued to every sense we had available, barely using comms for fear of attracting attention... Nothing. Nothing alive at any rate. Dust and Ash and Snow, Ice, Hail, Rain, Cold (at least for Flats and the like: I'm Space-Rated.)\n\nSo, we land 100m outside the Facility. Start making our way towards it. We leave the Plane (We want to get the hell out of Earth Atmosphere.) We start to move towards the facility.\n\nWe quickly come across a headless Child-Sized Body. Headless. Recent. We quickly meet the things that did it: Headhunters. One of which introduced his? (He/it/she? fuck it, Sheit!) sheitelf by wrapping itself around Poster-Girl's Battlesuited head.\n\nI shoot it it. This disconcerted her, but I had the time: I lack an obvious head, and the buzzsaw of the one nearest me didn't penetrate.\n\nOne of them, I might add, just hovered around a bit: It already had a head, you see (guess from where?) Anyway, having scared Poster-Girl a little more (and recovering the stack) we begin making our merry way towards a likely airlock again.\n\nAnd look behind us to saw a bloody swarm of the fuckers! Running time!\n\nCourse, wasn't really necessary, cos the base sprouts Energy Weapon Turrets (Modified Spaceship Point Defense emplacement) and drives them off in a hail of dead Headhunters.\n\nWe could have taken them. Really. Ammunition permitting.\n\nSo, anyway, someone lets us in. A Neotenic*, to be precise. He's a researcher of some sort, or at least a good fork (memory alterations, however. Alpha Fork with subtle pruning in the memory department most likely.)\n\n[Meta Corner]: A Neotenic is a child-sized biological Morph. They're often used to keep resource costs low: A child-szed thing uses less than an adult-sized thing. Ah, ethical quandaries.\n\nIt rapidly comes out that's he avoiding the Security chief. Well, all of the Security chief. The Security Chief Forked himself 5 times.They kept empty Neotenic Morphs on hand for replacements and new hires (Reception only Egobridge,) although really he also chewed through the researcher's Morphs (overwriting the Cortical Stacks. Mass Murder! Yay!)\n\nSo, we consider the Security Chief very dangerous.\n\nSo, anyway, once we agree to secure his safety and escape, he becomes rather helpful. (relaying information to our Proxy as we go)\n\nOh yes, the Bomb's here,why do you ask? Well, you see, it's a failsafe in case the project goes wrong! Well, the Project? I'm glad you asked!\n\nIT'S ONLY A FUCKING SEED AI!\n\n'Oh, but it only answers question!'\n\nThey asked it if, as a general case (Question-Answering Seed AI) it was safe to use. The answer (why, they achieved success with the project but days ago!) Was, wait for it...\n\n'No.' With a vast list of Cavets and exceptions, downloaded straight into their brains, courtesy of their now burnt out Mesh Inserts!\n\nThe dead one outside didn't take it so well. The Security chief, also. Apparently, this facility was in use pre-fall, for some religion or other, and the Security chief decided that some divine punishment was in order for the researchers.\n\nApparently some of them were still alive in the, I quote 'chapel'. And lo and behold, there were: One tied to a lectern, and one headless on the alter. Do you catch a theme here, do you, do you? Well, you should! Headhunters! Two of them! Then swiftly none of them!\n\nWe were just cutting the alive one loose when the Security Chief arrived outside. All six of him remember. All six, child-sized versions of him.\n\nWell, The Frag Grenade didn't do much, which was nice. Poster-Girl was just getting into mockery when they piled in.\n\nThe Plasma Rifle did a bit more damage, I will admit. Fortunately, to Poster Girl. Rather wounded her, but didn't knock her out, or even down. He died very swiftly afterwards.\n\nDon't do Murder Kids, it makes you make sub-optimal tactical decisions!\n\nLet me tell you: Neotenics are a little harder to hit, but they go down easier. If everyone we ever fought could just sleeve into them I'd be grateful.\n\nSo, the rest of them went down pretty quick. Poster-Girl threw the Second Frag back (funnily enough, away from the Plasma Rifle) and that, pretty much, was that.\n\nSo, one Security Chief in Six bodies (and a few stacks) later, We are the mortal lords and masters of this facility. I go down to inspect the Anti-Matter Bomb, whilst Poster-Girl plays mum (ha) with the Researchers. (After she nabbed the Plasma Rifle. Good choice.)\n\nI, err... Had to go through the AI chamber. It had some old, solid matter fabricators, and it was making paper. Paper copies of the answer it's forced upon the inhabitants. I took a few copies.\n\nIt must have noticed me, because it stopped, and printed out a sheet with\n\n    Input Question\n\nOn it. I was tempted, *oh* I was tempted. But I don't think I would be able to handle that sort of power mentally speaking. Even assuming it was actually providing accurate answers. Or answers we could use. This was something beyond us.\n\nWell, not quite. I asked it to calculate Pi on the way back up\n\nAnd that made it an Existential Threat.\n\nThe Antimatter Bomb was all there, Quantum Entanglement Trigger and all intact.\n\nNow, most of an Anti-Matter Bomb is around it *not* going off. So literally stuffing a couple of grenades next to sensitive bits will work when the Grenades go off. I set them for 24 hours. Nice number. Symbolic. One Earth Day (more or less.)\n\nSo, a little while later, we make off to the Plane. Course, the Plane's fucking ripped to shreds by, you guessed it, headhunters.\n\nOverland travel is fun!\n\nVast Swarms of Headhunters between us and the Base Station are Fun!\n\nGiant, flaming thing coming down to the Earth from Space are... Unexpected?\n\nWell, turns out Firewall cares after all! T'was a Shuttle, with Ms. Bay on the very rapid-firing guns which chewed through the Headhunters, our previously recruited (and very tense) Civvie Pilot- Well, piloting.\n\nSomehow, the Kill-Sats didn't nab them on the way down, nor on the way up, containing us, the surviving researchers and some Cortical Stacks!\n\nHoly Fuck we survived that!\n\nHoly fuck!\n\n    No. The Plane was still there, you flew back up to the Carriage, which took you back up to the Station. You went around the Outside to avoid the Exsurge Reaper, and signaled for Pick up.\n\n    No mention at all of the shuttle.\n\n    **At All.**\n\nAnd, well, guess what? The Grenades didn't work. Firewall jammed a Tungsten Rod into it from Orbit. We're informed the Antimatter Bomb went off.\n\nBut I'm back up. Holy shit. Holy Shit I survived it.\n\n    The Bomb went off. Understand?",

        "text": "I've started a new game this week, loosely based around pathfinder, with higher power levels but the same limitations. \n\nMostly, spells are more powerful, rule of cool is in full effect, and we have no penalty for moving and casting. Basically, made the game more dynamic and fast. \n\nThis time, I was a player, a wizard, specialising in illusions, with the Mage of the Veil specialisation. \nMy Orthmald, however, looks like a rogue, and loves using a disguise self spell (here a class ability) to appear like a warrior. Combined with his use of Silent Image and Ghost Sound ( also, concentration isn't a standard ability but a minor one. Again, because it slowed the game way too much on our first try). \n\nSo, our party, composed of me,  Maxim the paladin, Drax the spell-less Magus (as he never prepares useful spells and just bash people with his sword)  and the ranger whose name I can't remember, are supposed to be legendary heroes, but for some reasons we are also way weaker than we should be for people who stopped a war singlehandedly. \n\nThe king summons us to help investigate a case of disappearing people in a city nearby, and while we are approaching we are attacked by an archer, really far away. At the town door we find a demonic seal that stops us, until the paladin destroys it. The town itself proves deserted, until we are approached by a little girl. Being the cautious rogue I am, I stay hidden, and manage to avoid the paralyzing shriek she throws, and defeat her using a color spray, that dissolves a demon that was apparently controlling her. Soon after we are attacked by our shadows, and our magus finds himself on death door, because, as it turns out, damaging them damages their owner too. So, I again have to do something, and use a color spray to dissolve half of them, and the paladin defeat the others by healing them. \n\nInstantly, the archer teleports our ranger on a tower, and they have a fight, during which he discovers the archer is really a conjurer, and he had a debt with the ranger. After a while, during which my friend is pummeled into the ground and utterly defeated, the conjurer/archer throws him a magic knife capable of throwing fireballs, and declares the debt as paid. He then brings the archer into the streets below again. \n\nMeanwhile, we were attacked by another demon, this time capable of controlling music. I blind him with my blinding ray, and use that time to disguise myself into a paladin, and use a Silent Image to have an army of inquisitors appear behind me.   \nAll the while the magus is uselessly attacking the demon and getting damaged in the process, since it mirrors damage, and the paladin is trying to keep Drax alive. \n\nInforming them of my plan by means of a floating illusion, Maxim prays to his god, asking for help. A natural 20 means he is granted the ability to make my illusions solid for a turn, and have their weapons working as if they were blessed. \n\nReleasing the arrows, the demon get insta-killed,  and we begin to celebrate. \n\nAt this point, the ranger reappears, and the archer heals the demon, who goes berserk. \n\nWe are gently informed by the Master that he is preparing a city busting ritual, and we have three turns to stop him. \n\nSo, I use my altered appearance to convince the demon we won't hurt him any further as long as he stops and surrender he thinks my army is real he accepts. We learn of his tragic story, him being a familiar of a mage killed a century before, and wanting vengeance for his master he gained this new Ford and powers. Unfortunately our enormously stupid Drax decide to attack him, and send him berserk again. In a fit of rage, I use my crossbow to remove his last hp and send him unconscious. \n\nWith almost no spells left, and the ritual started anew, I decide to appeal to the rule of cool. \n\nI hide under a wall of light with the paladin (still my Silent Image from before) and together we figure that he can craft a silver seal to stop him, using the arrows that we materialised. Only, it would take 4 turns, that we don't have. \n\nSo, I put him to work, and have the ranger distract the demon with gunpowder. As the beast was casting a tower of tones with destructive sounds (don't ask), the loud noise gains us two turns, since he spends one turn staggered and another restarting his spell. \n\nBeing really angry, though, he costs a more powerful attack, and soars into the air, 60 feets up.\n\nI use enlarge person on Maxim (with the mythic modifiers), and with his completed seals he jumps onto the column of tones under the beast. At the last moment, though, the creature surrounds himself in tones, and only the fireball spewing knife of the ranger allows us to uncover the caster finishing his ritual. \n\nSo, with just one turn left, both for the ritual and my enlarging spell, the paladin, in a series of lucky critical successes, jump over the column and drops onto it, yelling an extremely out of character \"Giga Sigiru Breaaka!!!\" but it being so awesome that it destroys the column, scattering it around, while I use Ghost Sounds to run through the audible spectrum to destabilise the solidified sounds (part of the spell buff I talked before). \n\nAnd so, we discovered that it was all a test orchestrated by the king, that the demon really was the Conjurer pet, and that we passed with flying colours. \n\nBut what happened later is another story (one not yet told even to us). \n\nEdit: grammar and autocorrect.",

        "text": "I apologize about the formatting, this was done on mobile. This is the story of the beginning of a now-finished, long lasting campaign, and the first for the players, myself included. This campaign didn't actually include any vampires for a while, but the bbeg was one, so there's that. Our DM has played a lot of dnd and pathfinder over the years, but this was his first crack at dming. So, let the story begin.\n\nA busy day in the Varisian city state of Magnimar, parties rage through the streets. Of course it was the perfect time for some sneaky evildoing. An incredibly auspicious fellow wearing a skull mask, not the best decision in public, kidnapped a high priest of Sarenrae. In broad daylight. Best laid plans I guess. Obviously he was seen, most importantly by our band of heroes.\n\n-Nilodan Cloudstrider, elf ranger. Orphaned, by a necromancer, and left alone in the woods of Varisia, this, my character, proved to be really powerful. Except I hadn't intended to powergame. Nevertheless, with his dark backstory and hatred of undead in place, Nilodan was free to mow down enemies with his machine gun-like longbow.\n\n-George the Rogue. Not much to be said for this one, very little story involved. He was a halfling, and he sneak attacked people with daggers, when he wasn't dropping them. This player rolled more ones than I e seen anyone else roll.\n\n-and our last, well he really wasn't a hero, Kaizer Knuckle. Born to an illustrious family of wizards, the knuckle clan, Kaizer threw off the traditions of his heritage to master the martial arts and perfect his form. He was a monk grappler. He grabbed things and people and didn't let go.\n\nThese three saw the man in the skull mask, and for reasons either valorous or simply greedy, chased after him. They followed him to an abandoned mansion. Windows were boarded up, and doors locked. Luckily they had a rogue. \nFiguring it would be the least expected entry point, they barged in through the front door, to find several skeletons just wandering the foyer and dining hall. It is here that Nilodan's secret technique was revealed: tumbling. Having only one attack per round, there was no downside to mo ine before each shot. Three confirmed critical hits in a row not only confirmed this, but cemented the legend of the Skullpiercer, headshotter supreme, blasting through damage resist any day of the week. \nClearing the mansion, up eventually proved the only way to go, and after talking down a banshee (Nilodan wanted to \"release her into death's arms\" or something similar, basically dead &gt; undead) they reached the final flight of stairs. As combat began, Nilodan, going first (I love high dex builds), a question was posed to the dm.\n\"So, I get on move action a round, and one attack. Can I use acrobatics to run up the wall, do a flip, shoot the enemy, and then go back down\"\nAfter a moment of thought, the reply came \"sure.\"\nNo drug this time, but the zombies guarding the high priest fell quickly, and he told the party that good ok' skullmask had run out back already. After securing the priest, the party ran across the mansion, and out into the yard. The yard where a horde of zombies waited. Like, 30 or more zombies. There was no way we could deal with this.\nAll of a sudden, the sky out up and a green ball of flame shot down from the heavens, quite literally it turned out. This Cleric had fallen out of the sky, and her Impact had destroyed the horde. We (I) thanked Elaine as her name turned out to be, and chased after the necromancy do as we now calls him. The party turned a corner in the woods oil to find him gone, and Nilodan's tracking skills showed no footsteps after entering the woods. It had been an illusion. The heroes(?) took Elaine to the temple of awareness, and the four were joined with a purpose. Stop the necromancer. And also side quests. And loot. \n\n",

        "text": "I write with a heavy heart and a heavy pen. A great tragedy has befallen the city I lived in. Although I had no great love for the city I spent my entire life in, it was still my home. But I shall start at the beginning of the day, yes? \n\nYesterday I wrote of meeting a queen, an Elven woman who lived in a splendid city among squalor. Her home was a diamond hidden in trash. I trusted her about as far as I could throw her, but it seems that was too far, as she poisoned our dinner to put us to sleep. Try as I might to resist, I could not stay awake, even with my great fortitude. \n\nI was lucky I wear my beloved journal on my hip with a chain and lock though, or I couldn't write this. Take my dignity! My weapons! But never my precious writing. Even more so now, as an account of things that befell the city. If I am the first to produce a book on the tragedy of Travaise, than great fortune can be made, as my book becomes the definitive work. \n\nI awoke being dragged to a dungeon cell in a dimly lit hallway with the half-elf man I arrived with earlier. He was a 'bard' as he said, although I must confess, he isn't very talented. He is on some personal quest to create a harsh and loud music, and calls himself Spoor. \n\nHowever, more importantly, I was being dragged! Me! An educated man of finer taste. I pulled my arms from their grips, brushed myself off, and fixed my tie for good measure. I snatched my cane from the hand of the guard, and walked on my own. If I was going to be imprisoned, so be it, but a man has his dignity. \n\nLucky for me, no one had inspected my trusty cane so far, as the item has a hidden blade in it. \n\nOnce we were in the cell, Spoor, my faithful companion (closer to sidekick) produced a small lockpick set. With it, we made our escape. It is here that I must pause, warning the reader of graphic content to follow. \n\nWhen the door was opened the only guard they left was extremely shocked, but here the hidden blade was necessary. I ran him through the heart, and caught his fall. Spoor and I dragged him in the room, and hid him. I wish I could say that we read him his final rights, but we were in a hurry. \n\nNow we made good on our escape, needing to flee this place. After all, who can trust a queen that imprisoned us after offering friendship. Not I, that's for sure. The only institutions that cage people are cults, prisons, and the military, and I haven't joined any of those, last I checked!\n\nSpoor and I would find ourselves at a junction. Left was the way we had been dragged. Right was new. We went right, and found a similar cart to the one we had escorted just yesterday. Hearing guards, we stowed away in the thing, hiding in crates.\n\nTo what turned out to be our great luck, the cart was taken to a large warehouse, where we emerged from our hiding place slowly. Once we were sure no guards were in the room, we sneaked through a backdoor, and evaded any patrols. I don't speak much Orc, but they spoke of weapons, and armor and an army. \n\nI had figured that the Elven queen was staging an army, but it wouldn't be so simple. There are more players in this game, and I need to find them, before they find me.\n\nOnce Spoor and I were out of the Scar, we hiked for a day to the farmland that thrives outside of the shadow of Travaise, only to be stopped by a humble guard. The man was cautious, as the land provides all the food for Travaise, I cannot blame him. With some quick wordplay however, and the promise of coin, he would give us a bunk to rest. It had been a long day.\n\nIt was at this time at the end of our negotiations, when I heard the tragedy. A great and loud popping noise, of atmosphere and magic. I turned to a loud rumble, as Traviase, the great floating city of mages quivered. It tried to stay airborne, and then it fell. \n\nAlthough Travaise had been suspended in the air several leagues up, it fell rather quickly. I shouldn't have been surprised, but I was. The resounding and deafening crash is a noise and sight I shall never forget, nor the wave of dust and debris that came after. \n\nI dived into a small ditch, and was spared the brunt of the blast. \n\nWho could have done this? Who had much to gain from the death of the mage's council? I thought it would be the Elf queen, but I suspect that she could not survive that disaster. So who could it be? Tomorrow Spoor and I will go back to the rubble, and see if we can turn anything up. ",

Staring at the floorboards, he wordlessly makes his way to the hearth. In the light of the fire the regulars recognize the man as a local bard of mild renown. The gnome shivers dramatically by the fire, only the faintest grin exposing this as an act. Feeling enough eyes upon him, the figure draws himself to his full height and throws his arms wide.\n\n“Friends! I come to you this chill evening with a new tale of bravery, virtue, and bold heroes overcoming injustice!

        "text": "Game: Vampire the Masquerade\n\nGroup consists of a Brujah Punk, Gangrel Biker, Ventrue Lawyer, and Malkavian Doctor (myself). We had some issues with keeping the Masquerade intact, and so the prince charges us with making his lives easier in a very specific way to balance out everything else. We were to deliver a specific werewolf elder to a specific time and place for peace talks, and were warned he may or may not be agreeable to the discussion. Set off on our resources to fulfill the request.\n\nWith some planning, we go for a two plan approach. Plan A is having the Ventrue walk into the club we know they frequent and brazenly ask. It’s a public area, so the wolves shouldn’t make issue with so many witnesses. As long as he doesn’t start anything, there shouldn't be any danger. As it turns out, that’s the only reason they don’t rip him apart on sight. Unable to convince them of his intentions, the Ventrue walks back out while he’s still in one piece. Time for Plan B.\n\nPlan B is to tranquilize the elder and bring him along without asking. As the Doctor, I have access to sedatives and training on using them, so we figure we’re good to go. We had already prepared ahead of time, so I wait, cloaked in Obfuscate until the club closes down. The Gangrel’s parked nearby with a sedan for transportation, and the rest of the crew’s a block or two away in case things go sour. The waiting game pays off and the elder heads out on his own, which seems fortunate for us. I make decent stealth rolls, boosted by Obfuscate, to get close and hit him with the syringe full of tranquilizers. Storyteller says I have to roll to make sure I figured out a correct dosage, and how long it takes to go into effect, the better the roll, the better my situation.\n\n“Intelligence and Medicine, right?” With 8 dice and specialties, I’ve got a pretty good chance, but beware a grinning Storyteller.\n\n“Nope, roll Wits plus Occult. You’re doing it on the fly and dealing with Garou physiology.” 3 dice gives me a much poorer chance. Appropriately enough, I roll 9-1-1. More 1’s than successes means it’s a botch, worst possible outcome.\n\nUnsure of how much to use, my character loaded the syringe up and injected it all into a direct vein. The elder that we were supposed to be delivering alive, collapses into convulsions. Desperately, I start trying to revive him with CPR as the Gangrel arrives on the scene. He starts to point out the dangers of sudden revival frenzies, but I’m adamant that we’re not letting the werewolf die. We haul him into the backseat of the sedan and I continue trying to resuscitate him while the Gangrel takes off for the hospital.\n\nTrue to storytelling games, we had to go into detail about our characters background before the game. The Gangrel was established as not being a local, and the player asks if that comes into play here. The Storyteller asks for another set of rolls, Wits and Medicine for me to keep the patient from losing all hope, and Perception and Streetwise from the Gangrel to navigate the city. I roll enough to keep the game alive, and the Gangrel botches.\n\nA merciful Storyteller would have the car crash and force us to find alternate transportation. Ours has us wind up in the highway headed out of town. Desperately, I’m shouting directions from the back seat while splitting my dice pool to keep our captive from dying, while hoping he doesn’t wake up angry.  Eventually, we manage to make our way to the hospital where the others are waiting unaware. We didn’t have time to communicate the situation, so we’re coming into the emergency room blind. The Storyteller has the NPC Hospital Staff take over, and he smugly rolls a botch on their check. After some hysterics around the table, we get back on track and the Storyteller gives a Gnosis roll that doesn’t botch and says that Gaia helped him stabilize. \n\nAs our characters are catching their breath (figuratively) we realize we’ve got just under an hour to deliver the (now comatose) elder to the peace talks. Brujah steals an ambulance as the rest of the crew grab scrubs and “transfer the patient”. We load him into the ambulance and take off for the delivery. Arriving at the designated warehouse, we roll the ambulance inside, let them know the elder’s in the back, and may not be too happy and book it before they open the doors.\n",

        "text": "Wrote a back story for my Dark Heresy character. I chose imperial psyker, and rolled his other stats. He popped up as being from a feral world and I just ran with it. I'm not a very good writer and I know there are quite a few mistakes. Corrections and comments are welcomed. Thanks for reading. \n\n\n\n    Inquisitor Datallis rolled over in his bed “Warning klaxons are never the best thing to be woke up to.” he thought “What could possibly be wrong now?” Making his way down the ships main corridors was no small effort. Throngs of people were flooding out of their quarters to learn the nature of the distress.  Had he not been Hive born he would have had more difficulty, as it was this was a small amount compared to what he was used to.  Finally stepping foot on the bridge he found the captain barking orders to everyone around.\n\n    “Captain Rathin, what seems to be the issue now?” The captain, a tall man of many years with the imperial navy, detested the inquisition. The fact that he was now nothing more than an errand boy for Datallis churned his insides. “Explanations will have to wait till later, right now we have to make an emergency exit from the warp or risk getting torn apart by the storm that just suddenly appeared on our screens.” “Careful with your tongue captain lest you find an Inquisitor pointed at you.” “I'll certainly take note of that later, right now I'd strap myself in if I were you. The geller fields are starting to fail and we are about to breach into normal space.” Deciding that reprimands could come later, Datallis strapped himself in and held on. The ship breached into normal space with a jolt. Popping out of the warp unexpectedly could be disastrous, sending the ship light years off course. The greatest danger being so far off course that the light of the Astronomican sent from the Emperor himself could not be felt, thus the ship would possibly be lost forever.   “Tila, where are we?” “Unknown captian. I can still sense the astronomican so we are still in imperial space but more than that I cannot say. There is a small planet in the area that may have a suitable atmosphere, shall I lay in a course Sir?” “Well, we can't stay out in the middle of space now can we? Set up orbit around the planet and maybe we can get Lokkar to find out how much trouble we are in.” As if hearing his name was a summons, Lokkar appeared in the entryway to the bridge. Unmistakably a tech priest even without his servo harness on, he immediately set to work on communicating with the ships spirit, only pausing for a few moments to listen to information being passed to him from the ships other computers. “Captian. The ship is well, there is minor damage to a few systems but it can be repaired with the supplies we have on board. It shouldn't take more than 3 weeks to complete.” “Well then, I suppose we will just have to wait it out then and hope our supplies hold.”\n\n    Meanwhile, on the planet, a young boy was preparing for another hunt. The same way he had always done it. Blessings from the elder tribesmen given, Kai set off into the woods. He already knew it would be successful, he didn't know how he knew, but in his mind the hunt had already played out. These dreams had been coming stronger of late and he had no idea what was happening. His camp had been affected of a great many unusual events of late also. Supernatural winds, walls oozing blood, and then there was the creature. It came like a bolt out of no where and vanished just as quickly. The elders said that the camp was cursed, that one of the tribe had spoken aloud the name of one of the fallen, and that the camp should be moved. This was to be his last hunt here, but he had to go. Just then a star started to fall from the sky........just as he had dreamed.\n\n    As Datallis studied his next assignment he was interrupted by some one at the door. “Inquisitor, may I speak with you?” Morthdrid was an average man of average build and average age. The type of person you could look at and never remember seeing there. Of course as a Sanctioned Psyker of the Imperium that was a nice trait to have. “Inquisitor Datallis, do we have any interest in this planet?” “No, I would assume not. We just happened to exit here. Why do you ask? All these years I have never known you to ask a question that you didn't already have the answer to.” I ask Inquisitor, because I do not believe this is an accident. I believe the Emperor diverted us here.” “Why here? There are no technologies or cities detected on scans, and what population may be down there is probably feral and of no real use to the Imperium. What do you know? Out with it.” “Pardon my hesitation Inquisitor, but I can feel the warp being used. The amount being drawn is immense and the psyker responsible is powerful enough that if left unchecked could open a rift. I believe the Emperor has diverted us here to find this psyker and use him to benefit us, or to purge him if need be.” “Well then. Prepare a shuttle and some men. Let us see if this man be true or heritic.”\n\n    Kai sat and waited for the rush of game headed his way, driven by the noise of the falling star. Throwing his spear at the precise moment the largest of the boar like creatures ran by him, a shot that no hunter could have made, it fell immediately dead just in front of him. Lashing the carcus to his litter, he hauled the creature back to the tents to be cleaned and prepared.  The trip back gave Kai time to think, time to figure out how he was to explain to the Elders that he must leave, the majority of the council would understand, it was his father he was worried about. The smells of the cooking fires broke him out of his thoughts and returned him to the more pleasant things. The stews that were being prepared and the smell of the pies made from the wild berries in the area. His kill would be the main course for the night a feast for the gods in celebration of them. It was to be his last one.\n\n    “Father, I must speak to you and the rest of the Elders tonight. I cannot explain now but there may be a great tragedy set to befall our camp in the coming few days.” “Bold words son” the elder 'Al Sün boomed. Lan 'Al Sün was a tall, lean but muscular man, known in the village as the Fire warrior because of his flame red hair a trait he shared with his son. “What exactly do you think is going to happen to the camp? We have fought off all invaders that we have encountered and even the wildlife have learned not to approach the camp due to the amount of predators we have killed. So again I ask, what makes you suddenly believe we are no longer safe here?” “I can not go into much more detail father to just you, I need to see the council and as Shaman of the camp you can call such a meeting, you know me and know that I do not startle easily. Believe me there is danger coming and it will come from the star that just fell.” At that Lan's expression changed into something more grim and serious, it seemed his son had inherited more from him than just his red hair. He had seen the visions too and knew that the ill star was just the beginning of it all. “Very well, you shall have your council. There you will recount to us all exactly how you know of this. We will gather after the feast time”\n\n    “Altitude steady, drop proceeding as normal Inquisitor.” “Thank you Jenval, Morthdrid can you still feel the psyker?” “Yes. He is located in an encampment to the west of our landing area, since the population is most likely feral I suggest we land a good distance away and hike in so as not to frighten them.” “Agreed, wise as always my old friend. Jenval take us down in that clearing there away from the encampment. We will rest tonight and make our way in the morning”\n\n    The night air was full of the sounds of drums, as the tribe celebrated. Even faced with the strange goings on of late, they went on. All but one. Kai sat in his tent quietly preparing a few of his belongings. Paint prepared from some of the local berries and blessed by the elders, his fathers battle axe that he had be given on the eve of his first battle, he would need that later he thought to himself. As the din of the celebration began to die down, his father appeared and informed him the time had come for the council he had requested. Kai stood straight and followed his father into the Elder's tent for last time.\n\n    The interior of the tent was unlit as usual save for a small fire in the middle casting strange and ever dancing shadows on the faces of the men seated before him. “State your name and your purpose for calling this council.” an elder spoke. “I am Kai 'Al Sün son of Lan, hunter of the beasts of the woods. I call this council so that I may inform you of the great danger we are about to face. Men like us but not like us have come to this planet. By what sorcery or witchcraft I cannot say, but they are here. I can feel one of them as we speak.” “Blasphemy” an elder yelled. “Are you saying they are not of this world? Only the gods walk between worlds.” “Honored elder, I know that what I say may seem unbelievable, I would not believe it myself if not for the gift of foresight I have recently received from the gods. I have seen them. They are here, to the west of the camp.” “Foresight you say, what makes you think you have the same gift as I?” Kai stood in silence. He had never known the reason his father was made shaman. Now things were becoming clearer. “I ask you a question boy. I am the camp shaman I have the gift of foresight and I have seen nothing of these “men”. Are my visions not as blessed by the gods as yours?” Kai stood still stunned by this revelation, finally working himself back up to the level he had when he first entered the tent he replied. “Father, I make no claim to be more blessed by the gods, only gifted from them. Much as I knew where to throw the spear on my hunt this morning because of a dream, I know this too from a dream. These “men” will destroy us if we do not give them what they are after.” “And what exactly is that boy?” another elder spoke, “Me. I must go with them or they will tear the camp apart and kill everyone here. I have not received vision on what is to come afterward but I know that I am prepared to sacrifice myself for the betterment of the tribe.” Pausing in thought at his sons words Lan drew a heavy breath, while he had not seen the “men” he had been given a vision of the camp being destroyed completely wiping the tribe from the face of the planet. He knew his son did speak the truth and he knew that he was about to lose his son forever. “The “men” will be here by the suns peak tomorrow” Kai began “I intend to meet them to possibly keep them from finding the location of the camp. I will make the journey alone and only ask that no one stop me. That is the real reason I called this council, not to ask permission to leave but to make sure that I am not stopped. The camp will be destroyed down to the last child if I do not go.” At that the council tent fell silent, the faces of the elders stoic as if carved from rock, even his fathers. “There is much conviction in you young 'Al Sün we will not try to stop you. We will give you a warriors escort to the borders of our land, we cannot go further.” “Thank you elders. I take my leave of you now. I shall leave by the first light of the sun.” That night held more dreams for the young Kai. A great black ship floating in space. A blinding white light in what appeared to be a great throne room a size that he could not comprehend being built my mere men. And the pain, there was always great pain in his dream, a twisting, pulling, pinching pain seemingly coming from all directions at once trying to burn the very soul out of him. A final dream, had him walking in the fields around the camp. Full of the greenery of the early season, a strange bird landed on the ground in front of him. Kai had no idea what this meant all he knew was that the pain was gone from him and it seemed to be because of the bird. At that he awoke ready to face his journey.\n\n     Datallis woke to the sight of  Morthdrid peering at him, he was tiring of these interrupted periods of sleep. “Inquisitor. The psyker and a group of the locals are approaching us. How he has detected me I do not know his powers must be great indeed, never the less he is coming and we should prepare for him.” Datallis rose from his bed and began shouting orders. He was not about to let the untamed psyker come close without an ambush set up to kill him if necessary. The few men he had at his disposal weren't the real threat, only a show to frighten the locals, the real threat lay miles above the planet ready to fire if things went badly, if they went bad enough they were instructed to destroy the entire camp. “Morthdrid, any idea as to what language they might speak?” “No sir. Most feral planets are lost colonist from thousands of years ago who do not know the light of the Emperor, they may speak a primitive form of low gothic or they may have developed their own language at this point it's tough to say. We have a young scribe with us that may be able to translate for us, Cortez I believe his name is.” “Cortez? Isn't he the weird one always thinking he can out shoot the assassins?” “Yes sir that is him. He has shown to be useful in the very short time he has been with us.” “Very well Morthdrid, bring him along and let us go and meet this new servant of the Emperor.” “Too late Inquisitor he is already here.”  Kai stood motionless, the thing before him was like nothing he could ever imagine, as the hatches broke their seal he crossed his hands on his chest the way he had seen the other men in the dream do and knelt, there would be no blood shed this day, his tribe would go on without him.\n\n    Watching the men coming out of the ship he announced his name Kai 'Al Sün son of Lan hunter of the beasts of the woods. It took a moment for him to realize they had not responded and he saw the puzzled look on their faces, when a small man with a strange device attached to his chest finally looked at him and tried to speak. The sounds he was making were almost familiar and Kai could almost understand them but not quite. He announced his name again and added a traditional greeting, this time the small man with the strange device looked up as if amazed and began to speak. Kai understood this time. Kai's gaze shifted from the small man to another standing there in the group, he recognized him as the one he could feel and knew when the man spoke that he had been blessed by the gods as well.\n\n    “I am Morthdrid, servant of the Emperor of Mankind. Will you accept His divine light and allow us to teach you to use your gift?” “I know nothing of this emperor of which you speak, but if it will protect my tribe then I will do as you wish.” Kai answered back. “You will know Him soon enough, I can feel your soul, you are clean. Your tribe will be spared in exchange for your coming with us.”  Datallis, seeing how at ease  Morthdrid was, ordered his men to stand down. “One problem down” Datallis thought “now if that fool captain can only get us out of here.”\n\n    That day Kai saw his home vanish from a dizzying height and there floating amongst the stars was a vessel even larger than the one he was in. Amazement and fear both set in at once and he knew that he  would miss the green of the plains, and the trees of the hunting woods. This was only the first ship he was to be on, he was immediately taken to an even more massive vessel, one that was as black as the darkest night sky and he knew another one of his dreams was coming to light and that his pain was about to begin. Many years would pass, and Kai would come to know the Emperor and even stand before Him in the room that knew no size. Through it all he did not ever break, thoughts of home always stayed with him and helped to drive some of the pain away. Eventually his training was deemed complete and the worst of the pain stopped and he learned to control that which was left. He was trained in battle and shown how to use the axe he carried with terrifying results he was also trained in how to use something called a “pistol” although he disliked it immensely. His mind became sharper and he leaned to control his dreams and even to use them to see the immediate future and plot the best way to avoid an opponents strikes, his very mind was becoming a weapon. He would go about his trade  living out the day in a small living area until there was a knock on his door and a messenger with a summons......................",

        "author": "Lycaneus",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3f5oke/ow_the_31st_volkothan_rifles_planetfall/",
        "text": "Sorry for a fairly long post. The Introduction post can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3f1768/ow_the_31st_volkothan_rifles_introduction/)\n\nThe game started off with the 31st Volkothan Rifles on board a transport ship heading towards the Death World Skrynne to assist in the defence of the planet against an Ork Waaagh! The PCs were introduced to each other by entering their platoon’s designated Small Cargo hold (minus Corvo as it didn’t make sense for him to be with them just yet). Upon meeting their Sergeant, he immediately sends them to the training zone as he was interested in seeing them in action to see what skills they had, and so Dutch, Harmon, Roth and Rodriguez (played by Will) faced off against 4 members from Second Platoon’s Beta Squad.  Lore wise, they would be using low powered las-guns that would not cause much damage but could still knock someone out. This meant that Dutch had to settle for using a lasgun instead of his lascannon that he was used to.\n\nThe training area was a small zone with a few crates strewn around to serve as cover. For the first combat of the game and me as a GM, it took a while as we all got used to the rules and ended up taking around 20 minutes for us to get through the 8 different combatants. Each combatant would take their turns, most of the time Beta Squad missed their shots.  However, Rodriguez did get hit quite a few times and was almost knocked down. Dutch’s lasgun jammed at one point and so he tossed it and resorted to using his laspistol that he was a little more experience in using. Arcus Alpha ended up triumphing over Beta Squad with no knockouts themselves other than a Vox operator who was about to collapse from exhaustion. Each PC was rewarded 50xp for surviving their first “encounter”.\n\nAs the last member from Beta squad fell, Corvo arrived at the training zone and observed the soldiers fighting before moving on to 2nd Platoon HQ command which was a cordoned off area in the centre of the hold, to report to Lieutenant Hal Haddom, leader of 2nd Platoon. Corvo was attached to the Platoon to assist with any Tech work that needs to be done when the Platoon makes planetfall. Shortly after reporting to 2nd Platoon HQ, Colonel Mortdecai Daggert, the 31st Volkothan Rifles CO, asks all companies to assemble in the main cargo bay for inspection and an inspiring speech.  \n\nAs soon as the regiment is fully assembled in the Cargo bay, Commissars immediately starting inspecting the troops, occasionally dragging a soldier out of the Cargo bay for incorrect uniform or missing equipment. Mortdecai Daggert then starts his speech “We are heading to assist a regiment that is dealing with an Ork Waaagh! We, the 31st Volkothan Rifles were created for one purpose. To hunt and kill Orks. We’ve fought Orks on Volkoth, we’ve fought them on Armageddon, and we will fight them here. Let’s beat the Steel Legion’s record at Ork Killing! For the Emperor! And always, remember Arcus!”\n\nAfter the speech, the companies filter back to their designated areas and continue training. A week after the speech, the Transport ship and its escorts exit the warp in the Skrynne system. As the escorts deal with the Ork Kroozers in orbit, the transport deploys all of its dropships that immediately start heading planetside. The PCs are in a dropship that holds 1st and 2nd Platoon of 4th Company. All the guardsman and support specialists are strapped into crash seats lining the inside of the dropship with their weapons in their hands and the rest of their gear stowed in a compartment above their seat, soldiers with heavier weapons have them disassembled under their chairs. Commissars are walking the aisles of seats holding onto handholds as they go, reminding guardsmen that now is the time for silent recitation of their devotions to the Emperor, even over the roar of the dropship’s engines. \n\nThe PC’s squad is the closest to the exit hatch as they were the last ones to enter.  During the shuttle’s descent it frequently jolts and shakes around. And the soldiers inside are unaware of whether this is turbulence, an unskilled pilot or enemy anti-aircraft fire. The ship’s speakers crackle and the pilots voice murmurs something. Only Corvo hears it and shares to his squad that the shuttle will be dropping them off in a hot landing zone. Corvo and Dutch decide to stand up and hang onto hand rails and prepare to disembark quickly upon landing, Corvo stabilising himself more by using his Manipulator Mechadendrite to press against the ceiling of the shuttle, Dutch grabs his Lascannon and hangs it down to rest on the floor with one hand whilst hanging onto the handhold with the other. Another Heavy Weapon trooper gets out of his seat and starts fiddling with his heavy bolter.\n\nThe shuttle crash lands with a violent lurch and though Dutch and Corvo remain upright, the Heavy Bolter soldier is tossed across the dropship like a ragdoll and lands crumpled in a heap from his impact with the wall. Sergeant Bill Hudson immediately unstraps himself from his seat and pushes Dutch out of the way who waited by the exit hatch for the rest of his squad. Hudson opens the hatch and starts down the ramp before getting shot through the head by a lucky ork slugga round, splattering brains and blood over Rodriguez who stands gaping at his now dead sergeant. \n\nThe rest of Arcus Alpha disembark, upon seeing that one of the shuttle’s engines is on fire, Corvo goes back into the shuttle in order to vent the engine to isolate the fuel from the fire. 2 Runtherds accompanied by two gretchin each are charging towards the shuttle, Arcus Alpha find cover and immediately open fire upon the incoming xenos, wounding one of the Runtherds, allowing Harmon to pick it off with a Long Las shot. Seeing their master die causes the two gretchin following him to panic for a turn, before continuing their charge alongside the other Runtherd and his gretchin. Dutch lines up a Lascannon shot, taking out the last runtherd and one of his minions in one shot, causing the rest of the gretchin to pause again before continuing to charge. Rodriguez and Roth combine their fire to take out one gretchin. At this point Corvo comes back from fixing the venting the engine and picks up Bill Hudson’s Chainsword, the last two gretchin charge into close combat range and start attacking Roth and Corvo who were at the front of the group. Dutch and Harmon move back to stay away from the close combat. Corvo attempts to use the Chainsword to kill one of the Gretchin to no avail, forcing Roth to take out one with the butt of his Lasrifle. Harmon takes out the last gretchin with a shot from his long las.  It is at this point that Corvo takes control of the squad and becomes the squad’s acting Sergeant.\n\nAfter dealing with the gretchin, a small mob of 4 slugga boyz come into view and start unloading very inaccurate slugga shots. Dutch and Harmon immediately start firing at them, Dutch blowing one of the Ork’s legs off with a shot from his lascannon, killing it. Harmon wounds one with an accurate shot from his Long Las but not enough to stop it outright.  The Slugga boyz keep charging, loosing wild slugga rounds at the defenders that impact with the hull of the shuttle. Rodriguez, Roth and Corvo each try to return fire. Rodriguez’ Lasgun jams as he tries to fire, Roth fires but only wounds the already wounded Ork further. Corvo takes a shot and finally kills the wounded Ork. The Slugga boyz get even closer, but it is too late, Dutch aims again and takes out one of the Xenos, followed by Harmon, scoring a headshot on the last Ork killing it.\n\nWith the combat over, Lieutenant Garven Schrilblut of the Brontian Longknives approaches Arcus Alpha. He thanks the squad for their assistance and for their regiment’s timely arrival and asks for their Platoon CO. Hal Haddom is outside the primary hatch of the shuttle, ordering soldiers about. Both the Lieutenants move away from the soldiers into a nearby destroyed building, Harmon sneaks over to the door and listens in on the Officers and learns that the Brontians have been getting hit hard by the Orks and the arrival of the 31st Volkothan Rifles is a welcome relief.\n\nHarmon returns to the squad and Hal Haddom joins him shortly after, he is sad that Sergeant Hudson is dead, but is also confused as to why a Tech-Priest took it upon himself to take command of the squad (everyone else failed their command rolls). Arcus Alpha is assigned duties unloading their shuttle and many other shuttles that land after it. Corvo assists the Brontian Longknives clean away debris and help repair some of the damaged buildings. A few brontians share some Lho-Sticks with the squad in exchange for some rations. After the days fighting and the backbreaking work, the PCs head to their designated quarters and go to sleep.\n\nTune in next time to see *Arcus Alpha* defend a supply depot and start their first proper mission.\n",

        "text": "So to start off with I’d thought I’d explain various things before I actually start telling the story. This was my first time playing Only War, and also the first time I have GM’d a game (I have had a little roleplay experience in the past, the others in the group have not, as far as I know). The group consisted of two of my friends; Anthony and Will and my brother Tom as Player Characters, along with additional NPCs in the form of a Character I made and some random people to fill out the Squad. We played the *Against the Savages* Rulebook adventure with a few additions of my own to expand the story a little.\n\nThe regiment that the Players were a part of was one that I made with some guides to what sort of Regiment they wanted it to be. And so we ended up with the 31st Volkothan Rifles, a regiment that is quite heavily focused on Marksmanship and Stealth. The players were part of 4th Company, 2nd “Arcus” Platoon, and 1st “Alpha” Squad, giving their squad the name “Arcus Alpha”.\n\nThe following are the members of the Squad, both PCs and NPCs. The text in quotations was the description the Player gave them.\n\n**Dutch ‘Heavy’ Wilson**: A Heavy Gunner played by Tom. “A young, naïve trooper just a few weeks out of bootcamp, who was given a gun and pointed towards the frontline”. Armed with a Lascannon, he is the squad’s anti-vehicle weapon, even though most of the time he likes getting multi-kills against orks with it. He is accompanied by his Loader Emil who is quite experienced with the use of a Lascannon and so treats himself as Dutch’s Mentor. My Brother is the most experienced in the Warhammer 40k Universe out of the 3 PCs.\n\n**Harmon**: A Weapon Specialist played by Anthony. “A keen eyed marksman with a penchant for making bad puns and jokes”. Armed with a Long Las he likes to stay at range and pick off targets from safety. He also enjoys a bit of Gambling now and then. He is accompanied by his Comrade Gant, she is a Leech on the squad and tends to use up their Lho-Stick and Ration supplies quickly through a mixture of Gambling and excessive Consumption. Anthony probably has the least experience of the 40k Universe in the group.\n\n**Corvo**: A Tech-Priest Enginseer played by Will. “A Tech-Priest recently transferred to the regiment, Corvo has a strict and tidy personality and tries to stick to the rules\". Starting off only armed with the Standard Kit for the Regiment, through the use of his status as a Tech-Priest and other actions, he managed to get a chainsword for himself. He is accompanied by his Servitor Ramirez who is somehow a compulsive Gambler (a random roll on the Demeanour table). Will has a fair bit of knowledge on the 40k universe but hasn’t read into it as much as me and Tom have.\n\n**Roth ‘Doc’ Vickers**: A Medic, created and played as an NPC by me. “Roth would gladly give his life if it meant saving a comrade’s.” He is very loyal and is the smartest in the squad, even beating the Tech-Priest’s Intelligence. He is accompanied by his comrade Carno, he rarely speaks and just sticks close to Roth.\n\n**Rodriguez**: The Squad’s Vox Operator, he is occasionally controlled by Corvo’s player when there are certain situations where the Tech-Priest would not be there or taking part an action. He is a trusted friend of the Squad’s Sergeant.\n\n**Sergeant Bill Hudson**: Points if you get the name reference. He has been in the Volkothan Rifles for most of his life, and upon creation of the 31st he was taken from the 24th Volkothan rifles and put in charge of a squad because he held a key location after his sergeant and platoon HQ were killed during an invasion of Volkoth.\n\nThere were supposed to be three extra Player characters but due to various reasons they couldn’t make it to the First or Second Sessions. Their characters haven’t been created yet but they have said that they wanted to play as a Sanctioned Psyker, a Commissar and an Operator. Hopefully we can get them into the squad when the next Adventure starts.\n\nThe write ups for Sessions 1 and 2 will come out soon, I just need to finish writing them up and proofreading them.\n\nEdit: Formatting",

        "text": "In the harrowed town of Cysael, terror abounded. Cults roamed the nights, a terrible murder had been committed, and the place was besieged by orcs and zombies. What hope did they have? That of the source hunters, champions of good- well, champions of- well, maybe not champions, but- erm. Well, they certainly had enthusiasm.\n\n-------\n\nFelgus, the leader of the source hunters, is a kind and jovial man. He's a geomancer and a pyrokinetic, and when he couldn't find a good helmet, he carved one out of a pumpkin. He refuses to take it off. An expert at buffs, a dab hand at cooking, a man who brews a myriad of wonderful healing potions. He's also a zombie. As they say, the cobbler's children have a deathly allergy to shoes.\n\n------\n\n\"Hup!\" **WHONK** \"Hup!\" **WHONK**\n\nMadora, the party's fighter, was doing something silly.\n\n\"Why are you tossing around that anvil?\"\n\n\"Because I can't carry it.\"\n\n\"So you're just throwing it from place to place?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because thrown objects deal damage. Damage based on their weight. I can't think of anything heavier than an anvil.\"\n\n\"So you've stolen an anvil from the smithy.\"\n\n\"Yup.\"\n\n\"And lugged it around town.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"One throw at a time.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh.\"\n\n\"So that you can use it to kill monsters.\"\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\n\"Monsters that are at least a mile away.\"\n\n\"Then they definitely won't be expecting an anvil. Hup!\" **WHONK**\n\n------\n\nWolves. Half a dozen wolves, roused from a dead sleep by the party's intrusion. Feral, cantankerous, DEADLY wolves. The party couldn't possibly handle this many in a straight-up fight.\n\nWhich is why the party endeavored never to have a straight-up fight.\n\n\"First wave!\"\n\nThe steam arrow pelted into the alpha wolf's nose, filling the area with a thick, choking shroud. Visibility was gone.\n\n\"Second!\"\n\nA bolt of power from a magical staff flashed out into the mist, turning it from benign water vapor into a localized thundercloud. There were yelps and juttering howls from within. None of them were going anywhere.\n\n\"Third!\"\n\nA boulder shot down from some unspecified location, pegging the alpha wolf squarely in the back. The rock ruptured, spilling deadly poison over the entire pack... but not far enough to displace the stunning thundercloud.\n\n\"And FOURTH!\"\n\nA tiny spark set the poison aflame, releasing a cloud of explosive gas... the result was fairly easy to anticipate.\n\n\"You ever feel like maybe this is wrong?\"\n\nFelgus, the mastermind behind this whole business, looked upon the situation. The entire wolfpack was currently dying of poison and fire, unable to move because they had all been stunned by tiny lightning bolts and knocked on their asses by the impact of the boulder. And even if they managed to shake off their afflictions and make a mad dash out of the circle of flames, that circle was in turn ringed by more thunderclouds, still sparking and ensuring that no creature got out without a stunning shock, leaving them trapped in the inferno. No creature would leave it alive.\n\n\"Nope. Anyone want some pie?\"\n\n------\n\n\"Foolish fleshling! You shall face the wrath of...\"\n\nFelgus was not about to correct the undead pirate captain in mid-rant. Instead, he made a small motion to his comrades while he put on an expression of fearful dismay, acting for all the world as though he was cowed by the villainous rant.\n\nThe rest of the party, meanwhile, was taking a look around. Apparently as long as one person was listening, the rest of the world didn't matter in the slightest.\n\nSo Volgraff, the party rogue, stole the pirate's wallet while he wasn't looking, hopped aboard the ship, and plundered the treasure room.\n\nMadora was doing a bit of practial rearranging. She was strong enough to lug just about anything around, and there were a lot of oil barrels aboard the ship. She grabbed a few and somehow stuffed them into her pack.\n\n\"Please, captain sir, I beg you not to do unto us as you did to that sleepy port town just downriver! The very thought of it sends shivers down my spine!\"\n\n\"Ha, it would befit a fleshbag landlubber like you, having your head impaled upon my tiller! And as for the rest of you...\"\n\nMadora was impressed. \"Big lug doesn't even need to stop for air. There, last one's in place!\"\n\nThe rest of the party beat a hasty retreat and [surveyed their handiwork](http://i.imgur.com/smpBr12.jpg). Several high-fives were exchanged, and Madora signalled Felgus to stop the dread pirate from dredging up more dreadful drudgery. \"Well, foul villain, I believe it is time for us to do battle! Your evil machinations shall not win the day!\"\n\n\"Pitiful fleshling, your arrogance will- ehm. Who put all these damned barrels here? Someone get these out of my way!\"\n\nFelgus raised his staff, the end already glowing with magical fire. \"With pleasure, captain.\"\n\n------\n\n\"Oh, good, another undead overlord.\"\n\n\"Shh! You know what to do. *Ahem*. Alas, the baron of bones, at last we meet!\"\n\n\"So we do, meat. And you shall know torments as numerous as they are...\"\n\n[\"What do you mean you didn't bring any barrels?\"](http://i.imgur.com/sPztaRI.jpg)\n\n\"My pockets were full! And I was a bit tied up with the anvil!\"\n\n\"Of all the stupid- alright, let's hustle. Where can we find some oil barrels?\"\n\n\"I thought there were some down by the church.\"\n\n\"We already used those.\"\n\n\"Damn. What about around back?\"\n\n\"Set them off by accident during that shit show in the graveyard.\"\n\n\"There's got to be some hanging around.\"\n\n\"Alright, everyone split up. We'll find some somewhere.\"\n\n30 minutes pass. The Baron is still monologuing.\n\n\"Alright, what did we find?\"\n\n\"I went down to Cysael and found one near the smithy.\"\n\n\"I got one from the beach.\"\n\n\"And I've got two from that abandoned shack!\"\n\n\"That should be good. [Line them up!](http://i.imgur.com/x6xyzXV.jpg)\"\n\n*\"Are you folks done screwing around? I had to listen to his entire life story! AND THEN SOME!\"*\n\n\"You mean, he told it again?\"\n\n\"No, you idiot, he's a skeleton. He's talking about after his resurrection.\"\n\n*\"Can we FOCUS?\"*\n\n\"Right. We're all set, just wrap it up.\"\n\n\"Finally. VILE FIEND! YOU SHALL NOT PLAGUE THESE LANDS ANY LONGER!\"\n\n\"Now!\"\n\n**[\"FIREBALL!\"](http://i.imgur.com/81fmeFQ.jpg)**\n\n\"He lived!?\"\n\n\"What do you mean he lived?\"\n\n\"Alright, alright, who's short a barrel?\"\n\n\"I was saving one for later!\"\n\n\"No being stingy, toss it in!\"\n\n**BOMF**\n\n\"See, this is why we can't keep secrets from eachother. We're a team, dammit.\"\n\n\"...Anyone else feel that was a bit unfair?\"\n\n\"Yeah, he didn't even leave a body.\"\n\n\"We could make a tombstone!\"\n\n\"Go ahead. I've got loot to sift through.\"\n\n*The Baron of Bones lies in this general vicinity, reduced to a fine chalky dust cloud by a barrel of oil. Died as he lived, rambling for ages and without doing anything of significance.*",

        "text": "The Setting: Pathfinder, 20th level, 2nd mythic tier PCs.  The world is a homebrew campaign, the 12 Cities of Calendria.  Most of the deities and the planescape are lifted from DnD 3.5.\n\n\nThe Story So Far: The planescape ended.  Our heroes, the Apprentices of the Wizard Tenser, managed to travel back in time, and are going through one by one and eliminating the major players and events that led to the destruction of everything.\n\n\nOur heroes:\n\n\nLi Yuan: Human Bladebound Myrmidarch Magus (played by the author).  An arrogant noble, recently suffering from PTSD after seeing his entire civilization destroyed before his eyes.  He has compensated by bickering constantly with Inora for several months.  Tends to instantly collapse enemies into piles of gore in one full attack or less.\n\n\nRogan of Pelor: Dwarven Oracle of Pelor.  A lovable healer, and the highest representative of Pelor on Calendria in this age.  So NG it hurts.\n\n   \nInora Silvershaper: 17 year old Halfling Dervish Dancer.  Likes boys, fashion, and rending foes limb from limb.  Lovingly referred to as Inora, Avatar of Death.  Feuds with Li because he’s a haughty jerk.\n\n\nKing Mulgan: Dwarven barbarian.  Champion and ruler of Marchen, a city who elects its leadership based on martial strength.  Hates magic so much that he dispels and even Disjuncts magic items and effects out of sheer rage.\nMoroke: Human Druid/Ranger.  Raised by bears.  Turns into a Colossal bear.  Likes strategy and killing bandits.\n\n\nOur story: Our heroes are in Hell, being contractually obligated to kill Asmodeus, King of Hell, as part of the deals they made to go back into the past (Conveniently, he was one of the motivators that destroyed existence, so this neatly kills two birds with one stone). \n\n\n Our party had previously made deals with rival demons in Hell’s hierarchy, to ensure that Asmodeus’ demon hoards found themselves…elsewhere.  The party discovered that the Ruby Rod of Asmodeus, the artifact that grants Asmodeus immortality and ensures his reign as king of Hell, had one weakness: It could be destroyed by natural (nonmagical) sunfire.  \n\nExperiments showed that the Weave (the source of all magic) in Calendria extended only to high orbit-in order to kill Asmodeus, Rogan would have to somehow get the Rod, teleport into orbit, and send the Rod on course to the sun, where it would become inert as soon as it left the Weave, and eventually would be destroyed when it was (hopefully) pulled into the sun.\n\n\nWith a plan in place, our heroes teleported outside of Malsheem, Citadel of Hell.  All of the normal denizens of the hellscape being…conspicuously absent, our heroes made their way into the fortress.  The few guards remaining, pit fiend Dukes of Hell, attempted to stop them…but our heroes combined might turned them into pulp before anything of consequence happened.  \n\n\nInside Malsheem, our heroes made their way to the throne room of Asmodeus, passing through hallways decorated with the armor of fallen adventurers that had taken on the King of Hell and lost.  In the throne room, Asmodeus held court as always, for what King of Hell would hide from anyone, even heroes of our caliber?  \n\n\nAsmodeus held court lounging atop his golden throne, the epitome of infernal charisma and power, dressed in finery that would bankrupt kings to even attempt to emulate.  Asmodeus tried to tempt our heroes into working for him.  He promised that the apocalypse they had experienced would never come to pass by his hand.  He promised them wealth.  He promised them power.  In the end, they refused to negotiate, for they had to be certain that the world would never again suffer through what horrors they had seen\n\n\nAsmodeus did not bother to get up.  He dismissed our heroes with a wave of his hand as he directed his court: “Kill them.” \n\n All of a sudden, Mephistopheles’ planning once more came to fruition: Half the court rapidly grabbed the others, and vanished, shifting planes and taking them out of the fight.  Asmodeus finally cracked.  His perfect mouth curled into a sneer, his pointed teeth showing through, and he began to leave his throne.\n\n\nLi sprang into action.  With a shouted word, he charged Asmodeus, levering his entire body into an attempt to steal the Ruby Rod.  He fought with the strength of giants, magically empowered stronger than any grip could possibly be…and yet Asmodeus’ hand did not so much as shift.  Laughing, Asmodeus flicked a drop of blood onto Li…and Li transformed into a powerful devil, growing horns and wings before the party’s very eyes. \n\n Rogan and Inora attempted to remove Asmodeus’ magical defences, hoping they could get to the Rod in time to deal with their converted friend.  Mulgan roared defiance, ripping apart any enchantments Asmodeus’ had left on him in a rage-filled assault upon the local Weave.  Moroke slammed into the King of Hell, a Colossal bear, hitting him with claws bigger than any other member of the party.\n\n\nAnd then Asmodeus gave Li his first command: “Kill your friends!” \n\n Demon Li blurred into motion at speeds faster than the eye could track, cutting Inora into chunks in his fury.  Realizing their threats had now doubled, the party fought with renewed vigor.  Mulgan plunged his two-handed axe into Asmodeus, nearly severing his arm, and Moroke finished the job, leaving the arm and Ruby Rod to crash to the floor.  Rogan moved, his arms extending to double their normal length, barely managing to touch the rod…and teleport, into space.  Li’s face contorted in rage, his master’s ultimate weapon disappeared off plane, and he vented this rage by chopping Mulgan fully in half.  \n\n\nUnfortunately for Li, he had not counted on the bear.  With two massive strikes Li fell dead.  With another two rakes of her paws, Asmodeus finally fell.  The fight was over.\n\n\nIn space, Rogan heard a voice in his head: Asmodeus.  Long ago, the King of Hell had forged his Ruby Rod, and had transferred his consciousness from his body to the artifact, ensuring that anyone trying to depose the King of Hell would destroy themselves in trying.  He saw Rogan, alone, and made him one last offer: The power of Asmodeus would be his, hidden even from Pelor, if Rogan would just keep the rod.  Rogan considered for a moment, and said two words:\n\n\n“No.  Dice.”\n\n\nThe Ruby Rod went sailing off into the void, and with it any hope of Asmodeus’ return.  Our heroes left for home, victorious…sort of.  Their dead would stay until they could attempt to resurrect them, and then they’d hopefully find something to do to cure Devil Li…or would they?  Tune in next time to find out!\n",

        "text": "*Our group has recently started \"Rise of Tiamat\", the second book in the \"Tyranny of Dragons\" campaign. In game, the party had all said their 'final' goodbyes and split off to have their own adventures. One long year had passed before they, by 'luck', had met up again in the small town of Briedlthorpe.*\n\nOur characters:\n\n* **Dean Cooper**, the party rogue, musician and voice of reason. He left to go join The Harpers Guild to hone his skills as a rogue. He got hurt and spent his time recuperating writing the epic saga \"The Traveling Tiefling\".  Sent invitations for his opening night to all his party members. \n\n* **Kitara Aristata**, party-girl noble and warlock. She spent a busy year avenging her mother's death to the dragon cult, summoning the Arch-Fae for assistance, becoming the Matron of the family and marrying her brother. All on the same night, apparently.\n\n* **Dirk Spently**: Champion, dragon-slayer, schmuck. New to the party.\n\n* *T'sa Ormesh**: Half-Orc Monk. Spent his year searching for the truth of his family, tribe, and heritage. Now that he has found his answers, he traveled over the mountains to Briedlthorpe to rekindle with the paladin, Vala. Being in the wilderness, he may or may not have received that invitation.\n\n* **Vala**, the Tiefling paladin of Tyr. Since her adventures, she has gone to her loathed hometown of Briedlthorpe to tend to her aging Foster Father and atone for her sins. She's spent the year looking after orphans. \n\nThe town of Briedlthorpe was Vala's small little home town and since her childhood has been a breeding ground for bards. Years back, weary travelers and musicians decided to make the sleepy town their home. They have since made an influence on an entire generation of children to drop their families' trades and become artists. As a result the Festival of Colors, a quaint spring holiday, had evolved into a bombastic affair about sneaking a feel from the lady you like to all around being a show-off. It was originally a day to enjoy the warmth, bask in the beauty of the colors of spring, and let romance ensue by taking the ribbon of the woman you fancied. It had grown to be such the occasion that anyone who considered themselves a bard of worth or in the loop of what's happening would trek across to this tiny town. This, of course, was the perfect place for Dean Cooper to have his debut as a director. \"The Traveling Tiefling\" would be shown for the very first time as the Festival of Colors!\n\nAnd this is where it all splits apart. So I'll organize it as neatly as I can by putting it into different posts.\n\n**Are you Flynn's Cousin?**\n    T'sa made it into town on the day of the festival when it was in full swing. People seemed to be in a good mood, quite friendly even. He wasn't there to party and was certain his lady would be at the church she spoke so much of. Still, as often as she spoke of it, she didn't give a layout of the town so he had to ask the townsfolk.\n\n\"Excuse me, hello,\" he started, approaching an older woman.\n\nHer eyes gaped wide at the sight the mammoth of a half-orc, then smiled politely as she spoke slowly: \"Oh. Hal-lo.\"\n\n\"Uh, yes. Hello,\" he continued, \"I'm looking for the-\"\n\n\"Ohhhh. Are you hun-gry?\" she replied while rubbing her stomach.\n\n\"Oh. Well, uh, I am a little peckish, it's been a while since I've had a meal, but-\"\n\n\"The food tent is ov-er theeeeeere,\" she pointed to the bazaar.\n\nHe quietly nodded and thanked her, making his way to the food tent. T'sa remembered how thick Vala's accent was, and assumed that common wasn't their first language, so he chalked it up to politeness and language barrier. He made it to the food tent, run by a young woman with lots of food. \n\n\"Hello there. I've been recommended for-\" he started.\n\n\"Oh!\" the girl gasped, \"Are you *Flynn's* cous-in?\"\n\n\"Who?

        "text": "*Our group has recently started \"Rise of Tiamat\", the second book in the \"Tyranny of Dragons\" campaign. In game, the party had all said their 'final' goodbyes and split off to have their own adventures. One long year had passed before they, by 'luck', had met up again in the small town of Briedlthorpe.*\n\nOur characters:\n\n* **Dean Cooper**, the party rogue, musician and voice of reason. He left to go join The Harpers Guild to hone his skills as a rogue. He got hurt and spent his time recuperating writing the epic saga \"The Traveling Tiefling\".  Sent invitations for his opening night to all his party members. \n\n* **Kitara Aristata**, party-girl noble and warlock. She spent a busy year avenging her mother's death to the dragon cult, summoning the Arch-Fae for assistance, becoming the Matron of the family and marrying her brother. All on the same night, apparently.\n\n* **Dirk Spently**: Champion, dragon-slayer, schmuck. New to the party.\n\n* *T'sa Ormesh**: Half-Orc Monk. Spent his year searching for the truth of his family, tribe, and heritage. Now that he has found his answers, he traveled over the mountains to Briedlthorpe to rekindle with the paladin, Vala. Being in the wilderness, he may or may not have received that invitation.\n\n* **Vala**, the Tiefling paladin of Tyr. Since her adventures, she has gone to her loathed hometown of Briedlthorpe to tend to her aging Foster Father and atone for her sins. She's spent the year looking after orphans. \n\nThe town of Briedlthorpe was Vala's small little home town and since her childhood has been a breeding ground for bards. Years back, weary travelers and musicians decided to make the sleepy town their home. They have since made an influence on an entire generation of children to drop their families' trades and become artists. As a result the Festival of Colors, a quaint spring holiday, had evolved into a bombastic affair about sneaking a feel from the lady you like to all around being a show-off. It was originally a day to enjoy the warmth, bask in the beauty of the colors of spring, and let romance ensue by taking the ribbon of the woman you fancied. It had grown to be such the occasion that anyone who considered themselves a bard of worth or in the loop of what's happening would trek across to this tiny town. This, of course, was the perfect place for Dean Cooper to have his debut as a director. \"The Traveling Tiefling\" would be shown for the very first time as the Festival of Colors!\n\nAnd this is where it all splits apart. So I'll organize it as neatly as I can.\n\n**Are you Flynn's Cousin?**\n    T'sa made it into town on the day of the festival when it was in full swing. People seemed to be in a good mood, quite friendly even. He wasn't there to party and was certain his lady would be at the church she spoke so much of. Still, as often as she spoke of it, she didn't give a layout of the town so he had to ask the townsfolk.\n\n\"Excuse me, hello,\" he started, approaching an older woman.\n\nHer eyes gaped wide at the sight the mammoth of a half-orc, then smiled politely as she spoke slowly: \"Oh. Hal-lo.\"\n\n\"Uh, yes. Hello,\" he continued, \"I'm looking for the-\"\n\n\"Ohhhh. Are you hun-gry?\" she replied while rubbing her stomach.\n\n\"Oh. Well, uh, I am a little peckish, it's been a while since I've had a meal, but-\"\n\n\"The food tent is ov-er theeeeeere,\" she pointed to the bazaar.\n\nHe quietly nodded and thanked her, making his way to the food tent. T'sa remembered how thick Vala's accent was, and assumed that common wasn't their first language, so he chalked it up to politeness and language barrier. He made it to the food tent, run by a young woman with lots of food. \n\n\"Hello there. I've been recommended for-\" he started.\n\n\"Oh!\" the girl gasped, \"Are you *Flynn's* cous-in?\"\n\n\"Who? I don't know a Flynn. I'm here to see Vala, and also get some-\"\n\n\"Are you hun-gry?\"\n\n\"...Yes. I am hungry.\"\n\nWith that, the girl piled a mountain of food onto a plate and handed it to him. He began to reach for his coin purse, but was interrupted with a chirpy: \"No mon-ey? That al-right. You eat free. Have good day.\"\n\nHe shrugged and smiled with appreciation.

        "text": "[Beyond the Wall](http://www.rpgnow.com/product/113405/Beyond-the-Wall-and-Other-Adventures?manufacturers_id=5370) is a game created by Flatland Games. I had recently picked up both the PDF and hard copy from RPGnow, and I was looking for a reason to play it. That reason came in the form of my younger cousins, who expressed interests in playing a tabletop RPG. So over two nights we created characters and they got to play their first session. I’m a four year veteran of the hobby, but it was an eye-opening experience to play with my early teenage cousins and one of their friends!\n\n&gt; The Cast of Characters:  \nLindsey as *Perdenzia, the Fae Foundling*  \nDJ as *Arrow, the Would-be Knight*  \nCaitlin as *Freya Pendragon Kirkwall, the Forgotten Noble Child*\n\nThe adventure started with our three friends going out for a walk in the woods that surrounded the village of Lundenfeld, along with Perdenzia’s hound Fidero and Arrow’s horse Order. Freya and her family had traveled here from the kingdom’s capital of Kirkwall as part of their annual summer retreat, and she often snuck out and reunited with her friends that lived here. Perdenzia, or Perry to her friends, was a bit of an outcast, having been abandoned by her true fae parents at the doorstep of the local inn, whose keepers had taken her in. Life was sometimes dangerous out here, and Arrow had to help train her when she accidentally insulted a knight and was challenged to a duel. Arrow was a brave, but somewhat naive lad that dreamed of becoming a knight one day. One summer last year he had taken law into his own hands and tried to chase out a murderous thug scaring the locals. Freya had helped distract the brute while he snuck in for the first blow. Freya herself usually stayed at the vast scriptorium inside Castle Kirkwall back at the capital, but enjoyed the ‘wilderness life’ out here in the country since her parents often overlooked her thanks to the abundance of siblings. Perry had joined in on the excitement last year, when the two of them uncovered a corrupt guardsman’s plot to rob from the treasury. They had stopped the thief and Perry was warmly welcomed to visit the summer home when she liked.\n\nThis walk was just like any other, but the trio soon found themselves heading deeper and deeper into the woods, and the trees seemed to take a strange cursed shape. They weren’t sure how far they wandered, but they desired to head back. Unfortunately for them, things began to darken around them, and they fell into some sort of induced sleep. Perry stirred first, feeling a bit freshened despite the fact they had clearly been asleep for several hours. Arrow and Freya had less better luck, cursed with strange nightmares of a goblinoid sorcerer leering at them from a shadowed pulpit.\n\nOnce all three were awakened, the group tried to come to some conclusion on the events, sharing what little information they had based on the nightmares and clearly magical pressure behind the unwarranted slumber. While they teased at the option of just heading home, as it was clearly night and they had been gone some time, they decided to press further and see what might’ve caused this strange happening.\n\nIt took only a few hundred paces before they came to a large pit, with the sounds of activity below. From the darkness they heard the scratching tick of the goblin language. Perry knew a little of it, and heard some hard-pressed orc taskmaster directing his kobold subjects to work harder. The group was unsure what to do about all this, thinking that the kobolds might be slaves in need of rescue. They decided to hunker down and wait for anything else to happen.\n\nAbout an hour later, the group heard a new force approaching the top of the pit. Everyone perked up when they heard human cries, especially Arrow. It was the voice of his betrothed Charlotte, daughter of Lundenfeld’s miller. He almost dove into the pit then and there to save his love, but the others stopped him. They didn’t know what was going on, and what kind of numbers the goblins had on their side. They needed to get more information, and Arrow decided to scout ahead. Great sword slung to his back, he moved around the pit and snuck down the ladder he found. Figuring that the goblins could see well in the darkness, he tried to be as stealthy as he could as he reached the pit’s floor and moved to the wall. He followed along, guided only by the faintest of moonlight. Kreya had fashioned him a torch, and he lit it with his flint and steel as he snuck inside a tunnel he found. Guided by the red firelight, he made his way until he came to a strange chamber. Inside was a large alter with a peculiar totem placed atop it.\n\nHe wasn’t alone though, as a small goblin carrying a bucket of water shrieked and dropped its load, spilling everywhere as it hit a small indentation in the wall and vanished behind a secret door. Arrow fled out of the tunnel back into the pit, dousing the torch and climbing back up the ladder. There was still too little information to make any plans, but he knew the room he saw. The secret door, and another hallway he didn’t travel down.\n\nA few minutes later a band of goblins pulled themselves up the ladder, on the hunt for the intruders that had dared enter their domain. The group hurried away, blindly running through the trees until they came across a pond. They all started to swim outwards, Freya almost drowning as they ducked under the water to avoid the goblin search party. They then pulled themselves free and started drying out.\n\nThe group decided that the secret door must be where they’d bring any treasure, Charlotte included. But the darkness and unknown number of goblins was still too much danger. Freya knew something that might help though. When she was just a small girl her grandmother had confided to her, in secret, the ancient language of the crows. This had seemed so small and meaningless, her old grandmother rather senile, but the lessons were remembered. She wandered into the woods, calling in the strange avian tongue. She got an answer a short time later, from a crow calling itself Ashby. He had been following the group curiously. She asked him if he could scout out the pit and inner chamber for them, and he agreed on the condition he got his own favor in the future. Freya agreed and Ashby swooped into the hole, deftly dodging the gaze of the orc taskmaster and kobold miners.\n\nHe returned with information. He had followed the bucket-toting goblin into the secret room, and had indeed seen a woman tied to a chair. It seemed that they were going to be bathing her. Also in the room was a goblin guard armed with a shortsword, and a goblin clad in runic robes. He gave the all this and flew off, wishing them luck and reminding Freya of her favor.\nThe group then set about making a plan. Daylight approached, and it seemed the goblins hated the light, the helper having scattered at Arrow’s torch earlier. Freya brought about a bundle of sticks to create a small bonfire as Perry tied some rope around Fidero, lowering him into the chamber. He created a racket, barking and running. The kobold miners gave chase, allowing all three of them to climb down the ladder. The three then set themselves upon the orc that watched over the kobolds, weapons drawn. They hoped to kill it quickly so nobody got alerted. Arrow snuck up, swinging his blade downwards. But the orc caught the sight of movement and caught the blade in its armored gauntlet. It bellowed its rage, cursing the humans and threatening to suck the marrow from their bones. Freya slashed with her swords, knocking it back and away from Arrow. Making the ‘would-be’ part of his title painfully obvious, Arrow swung again, only to have the orc catch the blade in anger. But this time Perry buried her dagger into its side, causing it to growl and break free, blood spilling from its side. The group corned it as it swung at Arrow, chipping his blade with ferocious might. Perry took a few steps back as Freya swiped with her shortsword, stringing an arrow and placing the shot right into the orc’s chest. It sputtered and fell backwards to the ground, twitching slightly.\n\nBy this time the kobolds had turned around to notice the commotion, and swarmed towards the trio. They hurried inside the tunnel, but Freya realized she didn’t have enough wood to block off all the ways of entrance and keep them safe. She decided just to place them in the kobold’s path, the flames causing them to shriek and flee, unable to enter the goblin caves.\n\nThe group moved to the wall, Arrow triggered the indent to open the secret door. Inside Charlotte was tied to a chair, dressed in a nightgown and a sack over her head. The helper goblin had a large tome it was reading from, and the goblin sorcerer wave a dagger about, sporting a rather eclectic antler headdress. The guard moved to intercept the human intruders, but Freya stabbed him with her dagger, causing him to fall against the wall and fall over. The sorcerer cursed in his goblin tongue, waving his hands as the whole room was suddenly doused in magical darkness, snuffing out Freya’s lamp. Everyone began to panic, rushing to grab the sorcerer who evaded their efforts in the darkness. They helper tried to flee, but in its panicked state it couldn’t find the button. The wounded guard slashed at Arrow, who was forced to put him down. Freya managed to find her mark, punching the sorcerer in the face and knocking him out with a hiss. After a minute the darkness receded and Arrow cut his fiancee free. Holding her, Perry grabbed the sorcerer’s body and Freya took the helper’s journal.\n\nThey rushed back to the pit, hopping over the flames. But as they ran out into the early morning sun, they found an orc bending over the corpse with five goblin warriors. The orc straightened up, drawing its blade and causing it to spark against his armor. “You kill Gorkil’s brother! Gorkil eat your eyeballs to avenge Lugdog!” he bellowed, and the party gritted their teeth. Arrow set his fiancee down not he ground and pulled his greatsword free, charging at the shouting orc. Mud kicked up as he flung himself at the warped goblin warrior, their swords clashing. But this orc was no pushover, expertly blocking his every attack, and slowing nicking and pushing him back. Freya tried to help with her shortsword, but could do little as Arrow was whittled down further and further. Eventually the orc roared, slashing his upper arm as deep red blood spilled to the ground. Exhausted, Arrow fell to the ground unconscious. As Freya held him at bay, Perry concentrated. The goblin sorcerer still unconscious and on the ground, she breathed deeply Deep in her blood lay the magic of the fae people, and she concentrated on the one spell she could seem to recall. Waving her hand over one of the arrows, it glowed a fiendish blue. She pulled it back, visualizing her target. The orc Gurkil pushed Freya down and would’ve surely killed her too, but Perry let loose the arrow, which struck Gurkil dead in the eye, causing his head to nearly explode with magical impact.\n\nAs the corpse hit the ground, Perry helped Freya up. The goblins and kobolds were panicking that both of their orc lieutenants were dead, their sorcerer kidnapped. Perry and Freya took Charlotte and the goblin sorcerer up the ladder, leaving Fidero to guard the body of Arrow. Seeing an easy target the goblins tried to attack, but Fidero leapt up and viciously tore at the goblinoid, scaring the rest off. Perry retrieved the body of Arrow and carried him up. They placed im on Order, untying him from the tree. Charlotte helped mend the wound with a piece of her nightgown as Perry tied Fidero up to be lifted from the pit. The group then quickly set off through the woods, rushing back towards Lundenfeld where they could hopefully get Arrow some healing assistance...",

        "text": "[Previously (by which I mean, like, a few hours ago), our heroes did some boring stuff that doesn't really matter at all](http://redd.it/3eka4y) SO YEAH [MEET THE PLAYERS- PUNCHY PRATENA AND RESOLUTE ROSE](http://imgur.com/a/VwwUP)! They're best friends. Pratena can hit like nobody's business, but lacks defense. Rose could survive a direct hit from an oncoming train, but lacks raw power. They both love forging stuff, adventures, loot, and spells that prove stupendously useful in a pinch. Rose has this for being RANGERY, and Pratena has this for MULTICLASSING THE FUCK OUT OF EVERYTHING.\n\nThese two besties are on an adventure! Where are they headed, you ask? A little place called Valhalla. Much like the namesake, it is a physical afterlife for warriors who die in glorious battle. Or don't, whatever, as long as you're a warrior dude you can come here and wreck shit. These restless ghosts are dedicated to the service of the resident war-god, endlessly fighting atop the peak of a huge mountain. Why? Because WAR IS FUN. But the sheer mass of ghosts present, along with the neverending battles, makes the whole area hilariously unstable and violent in terms of weather. The peak itself is at the center of a small but neverending hurricane. And the BEST FRIENDS are marching straight toward it.\n\nThankfully, Rose and Pratena are both consumate outdoorsmen, and managed to keep their footing and work their way up the hellish peaks, all the while enduring incredible winds, stinging rain, the occasional tornado, huge hailstones, and about three lightning strikes (all of which hit rose, obviously). But finally they made it to the peak, where the eye of the storm was, and they celebrated their victory with high-fives and some surruptitious name-carving.\n\n\"ROSE WAS HERE, BITCHES!\"\n\nUnfortunately, the peak appeared barren... for a moment. Pratena focused, and started to see the outline of dozens of ghosts... all orcs! Orcs frenzied into ghostly battles, whaling on eachother like there was no tomorrow! Or perhaps no today. They're ghosts, they didn't really give a shit. And there were dozens, hundreds, thousands! Virkri couldn't make anything out until she crit failed a perception check and her head fell off. Without the distraction of eyes, she could see everything much more clearly!\n\nNow, what were these intrepid adventurers doing here? Well, Pratena insisted on making the journey so that she could pay her respects to her departed mother (an orc, she was adopted, but what did that matter?) and Rose was on the hunt for LEGENDARY LOOT. Valhalla was the battleground of an [ancient hero](http://redd.it/2y7yqr), renowned for general badassery and mary-sueness, who had fought thousands of people on this very site. It was just possible that some scrap of, ahem, lost treasure would be there for the taking.\n\nThe BESTIES advanced into the horde of ghosts, seeing what was going on and searching for familiar faces, respectively. They found faces that were all TOO familiar- old buddies from their [evil summoner](http://redd.it/3b7igg) days. Specifically, mechanical constructs that had actual, real souls nailed into them. Literally nailed- the party themselves had sold [the technology](http://redd.it/314rwc) to a bunch of mad scientist gnomes (so, regular gnomes) that had immediately decided to go full terminator on this shit. The result was five clockwork automatons, with the spirits of dead warriors within them. Until one of them exploded and blahdy blahdy blah long story short there were [four murderous robots and one extremely unfortunate halfling who was doing a body-sharing thing with a raving pyromaniac](http://imgur.com/3z5vwDG).\n\nAll of those murderous souls had come from HERE, as it turned out. They were all the souls of former Valhallan arena champions, and now that they had physical bodies, they were defending their titles in a huge melee. Oh, and there was a prize! An old artifact straight from the days of Lore-\"I WANT THAT GIMME\"\n\nUnfortunately, Rose and Pratena had no luck in the melee, being slapped silly by insubstantial opponents who went straight through their armor. The Besties decided to back off and see what happened. The murderbots emerged victorious, by way of having physical bodies and teaming up on all the other ghosts, and they claimed their prize!\n\n...or tried to. Repeatedly. The busted sword that was the grand prize could not be gripped by the hands of ghosts or, it seemed, robots. This drove the four 'bots into incoherent rage and disappointment, but as it turned out, the body-sharing pyromaniac could pick it up just fine. It's just that he didn't use swords. And couldn't repair them. And preferred to set things on fire the old-fashioned way, with fireballs.\n\nThe Besties came up with a cunning plan, which involved resting up until the ghosty-stabs, hailstones and lightning bolts wore off, and then challenging the murderbots (or, more specifically, the one murderbot that wasn't a bot) to a duel for ownership of the broken sword. There was a quick debate about whether they should do it one-on-one or two-on-two, but they eventually settled on two-on-two. Don't break up the besties! Of course, this also meant that they would be up against TWO of the murderbots, one of which was the crazy fire-sorcerer and the other being randomly chosen from the rest.\n\nThus it was that Rose and Pratena started an arena fight with Slappy the Slapper and Shambles the Incinerator- two opponents who were very powerful and higher level than the Besties. Things went south fast, as the Murderbots won initiative and blasted both of the besties with a fiery chain lighting, and both of them crit failed their saves. That first attack had taken off more than half of their health, each, and they were determined not to let that happen twice. Rose and Pratena ganged up on Shambles and beat him into unconsciousness on their first round.\n\nThat left Slappy. Slappy was no pushover, having the offensive power to make anyone think twice and the robotic defenses to make damaging him extremely difficult. He entered the fray with a critical Pummeling Charge slap, which blasted Pratena down from half health to TWO FUCKING HIT POINTS. Now you know how your opponents feel, missy! Something about the situation had to change, and FAST, because Pratena was the main damage-dealer and while Rose was a fantastic tank, she couldn't hold up to the Slappy Barrage forever.\n\nThey handled the situation by changing the rules. Pratena whipped out one of her second-level spells she had prepared just for such an occasion- Limp Lash. A whip of dark magic shot around Slappy's mechanical throat, and despite all of the sexy immunities constructs get, he was NOT immune to a d6 penalty on all of his ability scores. All Pratena had to do was hold onto the whip. All Slappy had to do was destroy the whip or knock out Pratena. But there were two problems for Slappy- first, he had NO attacks that did anything but Bludgeoning damage, and that couldn't disrupt a whip. Second, the way to Pratena was blocked by Rose, who was prepared to tank ALL OF THE THINGS.\n\nSlappy dodged and weaved. No good, Rose barred him wherever he went. He disarmed Rose, sending her sexy custom-made spear flying away. She still blocked him. He tried to pummel her, but her armor class was too high for anything but a crit to land. He tried to TRIP her, to BULL RUSH her, but nothing worked- his scores just kept getting lower and lower, and his rolls were too low to dislodge the stubborn dullahan. Slappy was forced to concede defeat, amidst a torrent of sulphurous swears.\n\nAnd like that, the Besties had emerged victorious! High-fives were exchanged all around (except for Slappy, who was swearing up a tornado and bitching about magic being unfair), and the party moved to collect their prize- the busted sword that had once belonged to Lorek! Only Pratena could touch it, as the sword was ethereal to anything but living creatures, and she inspected the fine blade to see it was made of Brilliant Energy- but something had busted it pretty good. In addition to being broken right in the middle, there were dents on the blade- as though someone had grabbed the thing in their bare hands hard enough to dent the edge, and then snapped it over their knee. Something with human-sized hands. Odd, but this particular mystery would have to wait, as the Besties were busy rampantly celebrating and preparing for their return trip.\n\nBefore they left, they had a couple of small issues to attend to. Pratena still had to find her dead mother, and Rose was concerned that the arena no longer had a grand prize. She brought this up with the murderbots, who immediately volunteered to go pillaging the lands to find a NEW artifact for the endless arena to fight for! Hopefully that didn't mean inhabited cities, you can never tell with those guys. Meanwhile, Pratena stumbled onto a familiar-looking face: a bloodthirsty orc ghost, who looked and acted a lot like Pratena's mother! Admittedly this wasn't hard, as most orcs act like rowdy soccer hooligans, but a tearful reunion was had and the orc ghost commanded Pratena to go out in the world and keep punching things in the face! Even if it wasn't Pratena's mother, she was content with the result and vowed to do exactly that.\n\nBoth players then proceeded to crit their survival rolls to get down the mountain, and wound up surfing down the hellish peaks riding on Rose's awesome flame-shield and a giant boulder that had been punched into a vague bowl shape, respectively. At the bottom, both agreed that this had been pretty much the best day ever, high-fived, and made their way back to their waiting comrades.",

Approaching the situation logically, I review what I already know from the beginning.\n\nWe first met Fell in port; where we were called by an old associate of my Lord's father.  The man seemed sincere enough, loyal to our name despite its hardships in recent times, and had intelligence for my Lord's ears only.  That information transpired to be co-ordinates to a place we could find a treasure ship of legend, The Righteous Path.  It was while my Lord was busy that I noticed a woman whom looked out of place.\n\nPort Wonder - in contrast with its name - was uninteresting, with nothing more than small trinkets and the usual business stands.  The woman browsing the stalls was finely dressed, clearly of higher stature than the other customers, but perhaps not at the same station as my Lord or myself.  She wore a fitted breastplate shaped like a corset; the skirt of her attire covered in what appeared to be purity seals.  Our eyes met for a brief moment before she sauntered back into the crowds.  At the time I wasn't aware, but the 'seals' on her dress were the mark of the Fell Rogue Trader clan.\n\nMy Lord returned with a gift from his associate: a map contained inside a pristine metal case.  He regaled us with stories of The Righteous Path, how it existed thousands upon thousands of years ago stealing the wealth from heretical worlds.  On its last voyage the captain even discarded the crew, leaving them behind in order to make space for more of his sizable haul.  The ship disappeared into the warp, never to be seen again.  The co-ordinates my Lord was given lead to old and powerful Xeno-tech capable of locating the missing vessel, ready for us to reap the riches for ourselves.  Such a bounty could save our family - my Lord's family - from extinction.  I of course had questions, but was convinced by my Lord's words and whimsy.  We would find this legend and make it our own.\n\nBut plans are rarely simple.  While we were discussing ideas a metal hawk swooped down upon us, snatching up the map in its knife-like talons, and returned to it's master's side.\n\nThat woman.\n\nWe gave chase but before we knew it we were trapped in an ambush.  She fled while armoured men branded with the same insignia as her swarmed us.  I rarely enjoy surprises, and was not keen on fighting a battle I was not physically capable of (I prefer my targets to be unarmed and already subdued, ready for interrogation).  My fellows spread out, brandishing their weapons and dealt with the guards while I slipped into an alleyway.  I was outraged; tricked and cornered by one of Fell's main commanders.  The hawk she was using; I recognised it to be special.  It wasn't a simple grapple hawk like I have at my disposal, the way it moved was... different.  Her one was manipulated in another way, reacting on her orders.  She was controlling it with her mind.\n\nShe's a witch.  I'm sure of it.\n\nWhen the threat was neutralised, we were stopped by the head Arbite of Port Wonder questioning us about the attack, and were unable to pursue the woman.  It made little difference though.  Mentioning Fell's name was enough to grant an audience with him.  He appeared, dressed in garish garb, his physical features far closer to my age rather than one of over a century old.\n\nHe returned the map to my Lord, obviously after copying its information for himself.  I could tell that my Lord was weighing up the risk-versus-reward of openly shooting Fell in the middle of the street next to a team of Arbites, but thankfully chose to wait for a better opportunity to take care of this new rival.  Fell departed, and we decided to leave port rather quickly now that our simple treasure hunt had become a race to the prize.\n\nIt was then we missed both the cult and the Inquisition sneak aboard under the guise of new crew members.  Seeing as my Lord was recruiting in port anyway before the confrontation, this would have been easy for them.  Since Port Wonder we have made no stops at any habitable worlds, again to save time and with none directly on our course.  Messages were most likely sent to Fell or the Inquisitor under his control during times we would have been the least perceptive.  The rest of the crew have explored two hostile planets thus far (Majoras Minor and Majoras Prime), and with only myself board to command in these instances I fear that my attention was far too divided.  Any occasion where we were engaged in a meeting could have also been valuable time for spies to send out what they knew.\n\nWhatever the case, the cult appears to have hidden more in the bowels of the ship while the Inquisition made sure to stick closely to us, infiltrating the board room as well as our Explorator Zez's group of engineers.  It is because of this, another new person springs to mind as suspicious.\n\nOur Voidmaster Court was especially impressed with the performance of one of the grunts.  During the visit to Majoras Prime (where they were able to locate the Xeno-tech and learn the true location of the Righteous Path) the solider was injured and needed to visit the medical bay. However, he almost ended up recycled into a servitor, delivered by mistake to the facility.  Court managed to find him in time and saved his life, albeit not all of him as one of his arms and legs were replaced with low quality prosthetics.  Apparently there was some sort of mix up of forms, sounding oddly like one of the poor excuses the Acolyte Adept would have had me believe.  Despite how this happened I will have to speak to this man while he recovers, to make sure where his loyalties lie.\n\nAt least I'm sure of the position of *one* of Fell's pawns.  Given the time we have left, it's best to play to our strengths.  No doubt he will send his final message while we are exploring the depths or the Righteous Path herself.  If we could pass him misinformation, setting up a 'welcome surprise' for Fell when he catches up will be more likely to succeed.  I'll need to speak to Zez and my Lord to finalise any ideas.\n\nFinally, since the presence of the witch cult can also not go unabated, I will allow Odette to send her witch hunters below and gather up anyone with those specific kinds of skills.  I believe Court is also willing to send men capable of catching suspicious activity.  We should be careful that this is not seen as some sort of attack on the lower deck.  Some choice rumours may need to circulate to make sure the workers stay on our side, avoiding disputes later down the line.\n\nI should bring this to my Lord.  I believe that we need to at least put these plans into action before we arrive, whether or not they can come to full fruition.  Feeling more prepared I head to the bridge, where I gather my Lord will still be.\n\nWe are amazingly close to our destination now.  The Barron and my Lord are both overseeing the operation, with no sign of the other seniors.  I expect they are in their usual haunts (Odette likes to stick to her tower, Zez is always in the library, and Court being the fanatic he is will be either in the chapel or firing range).  I approach my Lord and he acknowledges my presence.\n\n\"Ah, Kaleb!\" He exclaims.  \"I wanted to see you.  I had an idea.\"  This is rarely good news for me.  Usually when I hear this it means 'Kaleb, I hope you're ready for some overtime, because I want this new toy that is completely out of our price range.'  We don't have time for that right now.  Just as I try to interject, he carries on.  \"I've been thinking about this Fell issue.  I think we should get a warrant out on him.  I'm sure he's into some shady business we can use.\"\n\nI just stare.  \"...you want to have Fell arrested?\"\n\nMy Lord struts about, swishing his wine as he speaks.  \"I've been thinking about the future Kaleb, where our family should go.  I've heard stories of Traders who hunt down fugitives, and since we have an Inquisition presence -\"\n\n\"- Sir!\" I cut him short, turning left and right to see if anyone is listening in.  There are no signs of ease droppers, but still I can't be sure.  It seems my Lord has tried to cobble together a plan with minimal information.\n\nI suppose I'll need to straighten this out.\n\n[Start](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3dfr45/tales_from_a_seneschal_rogue_trader/) | [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3dr42a/tales_from_a_seneschal_part_2_rogue_trader//) | [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3fjm2w/tales_from_a_seneschal_part_4_rogue_trader/) | [Last](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3i4hxx/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_6/)",

        "text": "[When we last left off](http://redd.it/3d7sil), [the party](http://imgur.com/a/1azWs) had just come out ahead after [a HUGE mutli-person battle](http://redd.it/3b39p8). What could be next? How could the DM top that one?\n\nWell, perhaps by sending the party into the lair of a powerful wizard! In a dungeon filled with traps and nasty spells! Pratena the cyclops brawler had gottn battered by these things, and was in NO mood for more tomfoolery when she found the door to mister wizard's chamber, punching out a couple of machines that had been producing a magical barrier. Rose the dullahan ranger was no better, insisting to be the first one to charge in and enlighten their foe about how goddamn annoying thier journey had been. The explanation was going to involve a lot of blows to the face. Barrel the halfling rogue, meanwhile, had been irked by the paranoid wizard's insistence on putting contingency spells into all of the mundane traps. To put it simply, they were all singed, tired, and sick if this guy's bullshit.\n\nWhich is why it came as a surprise when his personal retinue fled in terror before Rose, and the wizard himself completely failed to cast any offensive spells, and promptly broke down crying. Hm.\n\nIt was discovered that this poor bastard USED to be a big shot, until he got himself in a pissing match with another wizard and got himself Cursed. This wasn't the average curse, though, it was a Curse with a capital C- and it was leeching Mister Wizard's power down to nothing. The entire dungeon was littered with failed attempts to remove it or overcome it, and everything he did just made it stronger. His career as magic man was over. The party sheepishly put away their weapons and offered some small comforts, reminding him that he still had a few levels left and maybe he could crossclass into something that fit his stats. \n\nTurns out that this little milk run was NOT the main adventure that the DM had planned. The party arrived back at their home base, a sort of pseudo-mercenary organization, patching themselves up and asking where the hell Thoth, their shabti magus, was. Apparently the idiot was STILL working on his pet project colloseum. The party didn't really know what to make of that, between his fixation on the project, habit of talking to thin air, and gallingly ruthless interrogation tactics from a couple of sessions ago. But the party had bigger problems- namely, that nothing in their immediate area actually posed a threat to them anymore. Something had to change.\n\nSomething DID change. Partyboss, the naga bard who had been their mission coordinator since day 1, informed them that they were going on a trip. Where? To central headquarters! The party was just part of a small branch of the organization as a whole, and it was time to shake hands with the Big Cheese. Who also happened to be a personal friend of Partyboss.\n\nThe party had a wonderful journey, cramped up in their sweet-ass flying airship, pointing out landmarks, playing monopoly, and generally going fucking stir-crazy. Turns out that a dullahan trying to sing \"100 flagons of ale\" is just actually a very slow form of torture, and the situation was NOT helped when Rose decided to take the controls and nearly crashed the ship (dullahans are very short-sighted). Still, they arrived safe and moderately sane at their destination, a huge city that had been constructed in the heart of the wild lands that the party called home. It wasn't as impressive as, say, something that belonged to an established nation, but it was the hub of trade and slapdash civilization on most of the continent. Oh, and the party's organization was the centerpiece of it all, acting as a sort of police force for the entire area.\n\nThe party parked their ship and walked on into the massive longhouse that was the Asshole Patrol Headquarters (yes, that's really the name). It was a big place, swarming with hundreds if not thousands of adventurers, each one trying to do something vitally important, like spend cash on weapons or eat themselves into a coma. No time for that, though, the Big Cheese was waiting for them!\n\nThus they met up with Secretary, the Big Cheese's assistant. They were inspected, questioned, and given a sheet of rules that had to be followed during the conversation to come. When the party emerged into the Big Cheese's office, they found [an ancient-looking cyclops waving something long, black, and made of rubber, apparently pretending it was a lightsaber](http://imgur.com/a/YAOBS). The party belatedly realized that the sheet of rules they had been given was not supposed to apply to THEM.\n\nThus followed an incredibly awkward conversation where all parties involved realized that the Head Honcho of Good Guys Inc. was waving around a giant black dildo in front of Pratena, who was still 13 years old. Facepalming ensued, and introductions were made. Miss Big Cheese was, indeed, a cyclops- a blind one that had not taken the Fighty route that was usually their race's thing, and instead focused on being a shaman. She was damn good at it, too, and she was a pretty charismatic organizer. It's just that she was old enough not to give any shits anymore, and throughout the conversation she gleefully made things as awkward as possible while ribbing the party about past mistakes and the explosive growth of their branch (the party was responsible for recruiting 90% of their branch's current members, not even kidding- they also hired on the Cursed wizard they had fought earlier in the session). Apparently they were behind a lot of boring paperwork that ended up on Big Cheese's desk, and they WERE going to be held responsible for it.\n\nTo that end, they were getting a new position as a Roaming Squad, which would go around helping out EVERY branch as problems arose. That way, the high-leveled party could face things that were actually a threat, and none of the away-branches would become too inundated with new members. In addition to this horrid punishment, Big Cheese saddled Barrel with a huge responsiblity- that of an incredibly unstable magical artifact, that was also intelligent. He was going to have to figure out how to use the damn thing and keep it from causing any horrible events from happening. The artifact turned out to be a dagger so etched with runes that it had more surface area than the room they were standing in. Also, it turned out to be INCREDIBLY anti-magical, as Barrel discovered when he tried to stash the sucker in his bag of holding.\n\nThe bag which he was storing all of his equipment, gold, and alchemist's fire in.\n\nDid I mention the bag was also inside Barrel's... erm, barrel?\n\nPratena immdeiately took charge and started catching the flying flasks, giving the casty people enough time to do their thing. Several hasty and kludgy uses of Sphere of Invulerability and Aqueous Orb followed, preventing the office they were in from being engulfed in a massive alchemical holocaust. Most of Barrel's equipment was okay, if waterlogged, but Barrel himself was not terribly happy. Being slammed up against the wall of his own barrel by a geyser of flying bombs will do that to a guy, even if the bombs DON'T explode. Also, his bag of holding was completely ruined. Big Cheese, who wasn't even trying to hide how hilarious she found this, generously offered to replace his bags- he'd recieve one for his equipment, and one to hold all of his bombs, because crap on a crutch why were you keeping your gold next to your explosives that was so dumb.\n\nThe party dispersed, going off to prepare for their new jobs while Partyboss and Big Cheese sat around and chatted about old times and the possibility of linking all the branches of the Asshole Patrol with warpgates. Pratena decided to go weapon shopping, and purchased two weapons that were so garishly large that he had to get a seperate bag of holding for each of them (yes, really). Rose flipped out when she found the armory, and had to be escorted out by security after she got a bit too *intimate* with some of the exotic armor. Barrel went down to the training grounds to get a feel for his new weapon, which was indeed powerfully anti-magic. It was powerful enough to surpress all of the magic in the area, and could permanently disenchant anything that it actually struck. This made it a hilariously dangerous weapon for everyone involved, as it could easily undo all of the stuff that the party had done to their own equipment just as well as their opponent's. Oh, and did I mention that it talked? The rune-covered dagger had apparently once been a person, who was damned to the fate of a weapon of death, and seemed pretty depressed and pissy about being used as a murder implement. Reasoning didn't really help, so Barrel put the damn thing in Time-Out while he figured out a way to appease the gloomy git.\n\n...So where's the action?\n\nNOWHERE IT WAS A ROLEPLAY SESSION JEEZE",

        "text": "So recently i have been dming Rise of Tiamat, and the party has been dicking around waterdeep, completeling small quests for favourite npcs and growing their characters all around good character development. This tale is about the party rogue, a half-orc arcane trickster, working jobs for zentarim.\n\nFew things to know about harford, he is a rather stealthy orc who prefers two handed fighting, has a magical Dice that acts similar to a wabbajack, upon rolling it the god of randomness, has something magical occur. This item has ranged from summoning within all the chocolate in waterdeep swarms of ants,causing the party to put a chef named Pazzoli out of business and then they went on a quest to get him his job back,but thats a tale for another time. In addition, the Dice more recently baiting with something shiney inside, and then severing harfords index finger.(This would later be cloned into an evil harford and set loose on the world). In regards to Zentarim, recently harford had completed an assasination job of a noble woman who was secretly a hag, unknown to harford she was part of a coven and they saw the whole murder unfold through the hag coven eyeball. So they vowed to get revenge by setting an Oni to haunt him.\n\nNow our story begins with the party going on a quest to retrieve some magic mushrooms from a cave, so that their favourite alchemist can create a cure for the spread of cackle fever which he accidentally started in the first place. On the trip the Oni began to invisibly stalk the party, temporarily showing harford its terrifying glowing yellow eyes in the underbrush, but as he investigated the bush all he found was some fox's playing around, which he proceeded to kill and hand to the party chef, a fighter named luna. That night the Oni proceeded to haunt his dreams, Harford is alone unequipped and nothing but foggy forests surround him. Yellow eyes chase hi through the fog slowly surrounding him and a crooked yellow smile appears to swallow him. Due to harfords low wisdom he was tormented by nightmares all night waking in a cold sweat, exhausted. \n\nThe party moved on thinking not much of it, and cleared out the cave, killing a Rust hydra(combination of a hydra and a rust monster) in the process and getting the mushrooms. When the party slept for the night harford had a second dream, only this one he woke up lying on the ground in a pool of blood, no equipement other than a dagger and leather armor. Lying next to him was the dead body of Lord neverember(Who he despised). he quickly escaped out of a open window assasins creed style and as he escaped he woke up normally from this strange dream.\n\nThe next day the road was foggy and trecherous. That night harford dreading his dreams to come finally falls asleep. He is once again in foggy forest, but this time hearing nursery rhymes faintly in the distance. As he investigated he came across a small wooden shack. The Oni nursery ryhme is audible now. A single ghostly apparition with yellow eyes glares at him beckoning him inside. As he walks in cackling fills the room and he hears the chanting,\n\n*\"Amongst the smoke, and in the fog he wanders full of fear,\n\n*His dastardly deed, has been done, His fate now made clear,\n\n*For You have slain one of us, so a curse we must bestow,\n\n*Every second day, the curse is thus, you will pay as so,\n\n*A waking nightmare haunts your life, and your dreams in tow\". \n\nAfterwards cackling fills the room as yellow eyes sprout on the wall of the shack, Suddenly one wisdom save failed later the house grows a crooked smile and swallows him whole.\n\nHe wakes and tells the party of his dreams, they decide they must hunt down the hags that caused this. But upon arriving at town that day the gaurds call the party in for a private meeting with the guard captain. To which he has his men surround the party declaring harford under arrest for the attempted assasination of the lord neverember, their clerics were able to save him in time, and in addition their wizards were able to scry the culprit, it was none other than harford! Eventually the party agrees to put harford behind bars for a day till they can sort everything out. \n\nThat night harford has another dream, himself stalking through an alleyway and climbing up a stone wall, at the top he disguises himself as a guard and walks through the familiar building, coming down a staircase he can see a sillouette of a half-orc sleeping in a cell. As he rattles the bars he takes the time to look at his complete index finger! At this moment harford wakes up and finds himself staring at another harford face to face.\n\nThe evil harford and him hit it off a bit and after some misty stepping in and around eachother the evil clone vows he will return someday and pulls out a teleportation scroll to get out of there, just as the party fighter walks back in to check on harford, harford misty steps back behind the bars and tells the whole story. Luckily the folowing morning the drunken party wizard had been scrying the whole thing with some waterdeep wizards and harford was off the hook, but now with two enemies to watch out for the nights are not as safe as they used to be for poor harford.\n\nTL;Dr Party rogue has finger magically removed by god of randomness' magic dice and that turns into an evil clone at the same time that a witch coven he pissed off sends an Oni to haunt his nightmares.",

        "text": "First post. My gaming group has been going steady in a Ravenloft campaign - that being the realm of eternal torment of dread. Fitting its purpose, the trip has been less than enjoyable and much longer than any of us would have liked. It's been an absolute blast and our GM has been very accommodating to our shenanigans, though never in the way we hope.\n\nTo date, one of our paladins has lost his son, step-daughter and grandchild in a single orc raid, our cleric has been slowly resorting to more and more implements of darkness to save us from damnation, and the second paladin to join us(recently, god love him) sacrificed his own life when compelled to kill us.\n\nOn the path to finding a way out of this accursed realm, our group has resorted to traveling by sea for what should have been a comfortable and *short* voyage down the coasts. But this is not how it happened. A dread vessel rammed and boarded us on our way, and it seems to have reawakened the damned souls lost on our boat. Long story short, to continue on, we're forced to set their spirits to rest.\n\nThe first of 3 of these spirits we knew the unrestful location of - the captain having committed her moldering bones to the sea rather than burying them properly. We dropped anchor and prepared to scour the ocean floor. We were not alone. Vicious undersea predators had sequestered the baubles - and corpse - among their hoard. Impeded by water, this fight would not be easy.\n\nBesides their acclimatization to the water, the oversized crabs had another leg up on us: our own party. Two members I have left out, a confusable warrior whose destiny seems intertwined with the plane of dread; and myself, a half-orc bastard whose heedless youth has twice-cursed him. But we'll get to that.\n\nThe crabs preyed on our weakness and muddled our fighter's mind. Our preparations had been to breathe water, not to deal with a heavily armored chain-wielding juggernaut. Our Cleric was pincered between the enemies and ally. Already battleworn, he fell to the carapaced beasts.\n\nWe managed to pick the lobstrosities off just after - myself landing the final blow - but it was seconds too late. In vain, our remaining paladin summoned all reserves of positivity left within him, but Fate was deaf to his pleas(he failed a 65% success, an 85% and a 95% consecutively. The Cleric was dead by 1 hit point.). Between the paladin kneeling and the cleric in his arms, these were the two possessed with miracles. And they'd failed.\n\nAs a last-ditch effort, I called upon my own god - he of Retribution. I made my attempt, mixing my blood with my foe's left on my blade. I prayed, but my faith should never have been put to the test. My call was answered. Not by my noble Lord but rather by the Dark Powers presiding over the Realm of Dread.\n\nCruelly, they granted my wish. They took from me Life, and gave it to my companion. And in doing so triggered the beast of my heritage. My faculties eroded as the Beast took control, and it sought revenge. \"Retribution\" against the Cleric who had \"taken\" my Life. I rattled inside my own head, but to no avail. \n\nUnder the waves, the sounds were difficult to make out. It wasn't until I was already upon my fallen comrade - being ferried to safety by our fellows - that the change was clear. In 2 strokes of my axe, he lay a harsh whisper away from the Threshold. My party did the only sane thing. They killed me. It was pins and needles for a moment. I relished Death but was afraid they couldn't deliver me in time(the Cleric was 1 hit point from dying again, me having half-damage from underwater rules, 1 more hit to his defenseless body and my sacrifice was in vain). To live as a monster, reviled, is scarcely life. To the relief of my intelligence, my party put me down. I relished the freedom of my curse, and of this demented plane.\n\nBut I wasn't so lucky. I lived. For the second time, the Cleric summoned me to my body. This time, there was no mirth. We both knew what happened. So I would live as the Monster. And the Dark Powers laughed.",

        "text": "So a friend in my current campaign recently had his character die.  It was tragic for everyone, as Charlie was probably the best character I've had in one of my games.\n\nIt all started when my friend rolled his ability scores. He was doing rather well, with a 16, a couple 14s, and a couple 11s if I recall. Then came his last roll... 4. He decided that, rather than have a feeble bard, or one with little to no common sense, he put that 4 in intelligence. And thus began the story of Charlie.\n\nCharlie was an interesting character from the beginning of the campaign. Alongside his constantly getting distracted by flies buzzing about while attempting to have a serious discussion with a city counselor, and regular referring to our fighter as \"the giraffe\" (combined with a life goal to ride him), I look back at Charlie with a wish that I had given him inspiration far more often than I had.\n\nI was creating a dungeon for the group around 3rd level, and was using the DMG roll tables for loot. I roll for the treasure hoard, and, at the top of a ruined watchtower, Charlie and the group's cleric find a small, rust-colored bag. As the cleric reached into the bag, I roll a d8, and out of the bag, he pulls a giant goat. The bard, snatching it out of the cleric's hands and trying for himself, pulls out a lion, which he promptly had chase the giant goat off of the watchtower. Riding his lion through the rest of the dungeon, Charlie came away from it with a bag he could pull animals out three times a day.\n\nAnd so came the bag's shining moment. About a month after that dungeon, as the party scoured a tomb for an ancient gnomish amulet, they were attacked by four skeletons and the skeleton of a minotaur. Pulling into his bag, Charlie summoned a Giant Goat. Charlie immediately orders the goat to grab the minotaur in his horns. I decide that I'd accept that as a grapple check.\n\nGiant Goat rolls a natural 20.\n\nMinotaur critically fails.\n\nAnd so, a few turns later, with the minotaur failing his checks every round, the giant goat succeeds at bashing it against the walls and ceiling enough to make what I had expected to be a much harder encounter hilariously easy.\n\nThe next week, Charlie was punched to death by a giraffe gone insane by a cursed sword.  RIP Charlie.",

        "text": "*Our group has been playing 'Horde of the Dragon Queen' for almost a year now. The story's fun, the combat is effective and I overall like the new 5e system. But the most memorable part of this campaign was the characters. I feel like my party has really come out of their shells and made some fun and interesting characters. One of the most interesting parts for me, personally, was the bond between two of the characters. So much so that I feel like sharing.*\n\nFirst there was T'sa Ormesh, the wandering half-orc monk. He was green wall of muscle whose only spell was 'shadow' just by how amazingly big he was. Aside from his almost threatening appearance, he was actually a quiet and peaceful man. T'sa was a monk of few words (he had low charisma, so maybe it was for the best) who would usually keep to himself unless he heard that someone needed help. \n\nThen there was Vala of Briedlthorpe, the tiefling Paladin of justice, honor, and specifically vengeance. She was an angry, grumpy knight who hid every bit of herself in thick full plate and worn down tabard. The only part that stood out was her horn that jutted out from her helmet. She was prudent, self-righteous and opinionated, but would drop everything to stop evil. \n\nThey started off in a tavern in Greenest when the town was engulfed in a raging inferno. They, as well as the other two members of the party, formed together to save the townspeople and slay the goblins that invaded. They formed together as a group through necessity, wanting to find the source of the problem and end it once and for all. The two didn't talk much during that pursuit, just 'go here' 'this way' and 'Let's launch the orc at it'.\n\n**\"Let's launch the Orc at it\"**, a phrase uttered in a moment of sarcasm from Vala in regards to the dragon that was destroying the town. This was a phrase that has since defined a core aspect of the duo: *Great Feats of Strength and Stupidity*. T'sa immediately agreed to this idea and had himself launched at the dragon. Yes, he lived (Thanks, half-orc racial bonuses!). \n\nThe two didn't get to actually talk (aside from 'Are you stupid? You could've died! I was JOKING') until the group had proceeded to the fort of the dragon cult. Before the group had known that the cult had members of all races, T'sa and Vala were instructed by the rest of the party (a human and half-elf) to stay outside and watch if anything happens.\n\nSo the two sat out; T'sa began whittling while Vala pulled out a journal and began scribbling away. With that, the two took that time and actually talked. First about creative hobbies; T'sa enjoyed his wood-carvings while Vala was bashful to admit she enjoyed writing poetry. The discussion soon turned to race and all the ugliness that followed them for theirs. They were enthusiastically talking about combat when they heard a ruckus in the fort and came barreling in to help their comrades. \n\nThe two since then had usually been in agreement about matters (aside from an incident involving a broken dragon egg and a nat 20 to the groin). Their solutions were usually more physical and to the point, although T'sa favored a more peaceful route than Vala. But whenever there was downtime they would often be seen sparring, finding homes to repair or other general good deeds, or just talking. In a party with two party-loving charisma-using characters, we would often joke about how T'sa and Vala were the ones rocking the chastity corner. \n\nIt was on the caravan journey where they discovered a great, fun new hobby: *wrestling*. Not specifically wrestling, but they took great pride in fighting as a team and being as bombastic as possible. They first discovered this while fighting back to back, Vala swinging him around on her back as he kicked enemies with rapid speed. It became an official sport for them when they suplexed ogres into each other. Every fight became almost like a canvas for them, and their moves were their brushes. \n\nT'sa had become more assertive since they met. He was more willing to fight than he was before. He would usually end up raging during a big fight and going even more beserk the moment Vala looked hurt. As for Vala, she became more willing to talk things out. She wasn't any *good* at it, but she would actually stop and listen to the alternate non-violent solutions as opposed to running ahead and painting things red with her sword. \n\nThe party had made it to a tower of Bullywugs and tried their best to keep a peaceful, stealthy approach (much to the joy of the party rogue). They had gotten in half way before blowing their cover and all hopes of a sneak attack flew out the window. That was when the party split up (I know, horrible idea) into team 'talk' (the rogue and warlock), and team 'murder' (Vala, T'sa and a temporary member of the party). Team talk tried talking an uprising into the lizardfolk that lived in the tower, as team murder, well, they explored the fort calling out for the leader to fight and rumbling with anyone in their path.\n\nThat's when they met the centipedes. Big ones to be exact, big enough to pose a bit of a threat. The fight took a turn for the nasty when the raging T'sa had failed a saving throw and fell to the ground paralyzed and rolling to just stay alive. Normally in a situation like that Vala would keep slashing until all the bugs were dead. To be fair, normally in a situation like that T'sa, being the medicine man of the group, would heal them. It was at that moment, for once in her adventures, a wave of dread washed over her. Instead, she dragged him to a nearby empty room and frantically tried everything in her power to heal him (she had already used up her 'lay on hands' and they hadn't rested). With some potions he came to, and it was at that moment it dawned on the socially stunted paladin as she embraced him: *'I don't know what I'd do if I lost you....Oh gods. Do I **fancy** him?'*\n\nThey cleared the the fortress of the bullwugs without any further near-death incident (being acid-bombed twice and hopped up on hallucinogenic frog drugs and having the Paladin use a liberal use of 'lay on hands' to cure the party doesn't count) they continued their adventure. All the while Vala kept her thoughts mulling around quietly.\n\nIt wasn't until they reached close to the castle of the storm giants where the two talked. Vala figured if this was their biggest foe yet that now was the perfect time to at least mention *something*. He had been thinking, too, in fact, and beat her to speaking. Ever since he met her, he had become more violent. He felt that she was the catalyst to his rage and was making him a worse person than he wanted to be. He was willing to fight the cult leaders with her, but after that, he thought it was best they never see each other again. \n\nThe broken-hearted Vala stormed off to the inn, and for the first time in nearly 10 years she had an ale. (She had chastised the rest of the party for their drinking habits so the rogue immediately panicked to see this) She decided to keep to herself, stay away from T'sa, and finish her knightly duties. It was the end of a saga. She would just have to accept it.\n\nThe castle of the giants was the morning after and went as one would expect. Getting a dragon shit-faced, intimidating a cultist to be our guide, fighting cult leaders, the usual. The two barely spoke, only simple 'let's go here' and so on. At one point Vala got nearly smothered to death by an enchanted carpet and a cultist stabbing her at the same time. T'sa went beserk and wind-gusted her (and the carpet) out of the room, to fight the foes.\n\nIt wasn't until the last cult leader where the shit got intense. She was a vampire, and oh Vala was pumped to fight her. The fight got heated when the leader began charming the players; the rogue and Vala were unaffected, but T'sa was gone. He soon let her drain life right from his neck and tried to pull his teammates away from her, even with only 3hp left. Vala and the rogue begged and pleaded for him to listen; the rogue using logic, Vala using pure emotion. \n\nAt last T'sa snapped out of the charm and felt the pain surging, collapsing to his knees in agony. Vala rushed to his side, kneeling down with him. He tried so hard the whole adventure to keep a sound mind, to not judge based on 'good' and 'evil'. He tried so hard to be the peaceful one. He looked to her and groaned, \"...She's evil. Get rid of her once and for all.\"\n\n\"T'sa. I would *never* hurt you,\" she replied softly, then placed both hands on his face and pulled his lips to hers (and also gave him 20 hp. Liberal Lay on Hands!). She stood up, turned around and smote the vampire into a puff of smoke. T'sa (and the rogue) stood behind in total shock. \n\nThey fought through the rest of the castle, destroying the vampire for good, getting the storm giants on their side with the promise of a play. The end fight was T'sa letting loose with fury while Vala offered them all redemption if they peacefully surrendered. The day was won, good was delivered, and the two physical powerhouses and paragons of discipline couldn't stand within 10 feet of each other without turning into awkward stammering teenagers.\n\nCelebrations were abound, congratulations flowed like wine, and the two quietly scooted out to talk. The awkwardness only multiplied, but the two decided to enjoy their final night together before they went out into the world. \n\nT'sa left the next morning with a note and a carving of a flower. He went out to the wilderness to learn about his heritage. Vala, taking what he said about her violence to heart, went home to repent for her sins. Their journey was long and painful, but what they learned from each other would be that to last a lifetime. The adventure had ended, but they would think back to each other and be reminded of how they had been touched. That was the last the two unlikely lovers saw of each other. \n\nUntil book 2 started.\n\n\n",

        "text": "This post can also be read on [my blog](http://ichargethedoor.com/final-battle-against-tiamat/). It will be cross-posted to a few other subreddits, too.\n\n---\n\nScott (/u/scottdelia) joined our group late in the game, with only 5 or 6 sessions left in a nine-month long campaign (Hoard of the Dragon Queen + Rise of Tiamat). He tossed out many Bardic Inspirations, and healed many a wound, but in the end, you could say that we inspired *him* just as much as he did us.\n\nThis is his bardic account of the final battle against Tiamat.\n\n---\n\n*The following was written by Scott Delia:*\n\nHere it is, people.  Patrick O'Malley's final tale for the time being.  He intends to rest a while and figure out what it's like to be a single dad... damn you, Evan.  I apologize in advance for any syntax and/or grammatical errors.  Remember, this is an oratorical speech, so there may be ellipses and commas that aren't grammatically correct, but used more for dramatic pausing in spoken word.\n\n**Bardic Commentary:**\n\nKeep in mind, as well, that I am a bard, and my goal from the start was to turn you from adventurers into heroes into legends.  So there will be some embellishment of your power, just go with it and enjoy!\n\n**Director's Commentary:**\n\nThe story may be out of order, not as \"many rounds\" as it was, and the details will be changed a bit.  This is done for a few reasons.  The first is so that it flows better from 'scene-to-scene', and so it didn't take infinity years to write.  It's also because I didn't feel like this was very exciting:\n\n\"Then Kolixen hit the dragon with an arrow.  Then Oz fired a bolt of fire at it.  Then Heavy punched it.  Then Reverence made out with Hadeus.\"\n\nEssentially, I wanted it to feel cinematic because cinematic is epic; let's just say our session was the book and I am adapting it for film (creative licensing).  I found it quite difficult to write a fast-paced battle scene with so many moving parts, so I appreciated the challenge.  It's also way longer than even I anticipated, so pace yourself... YEAH, YOU!  PACE YOURSELF!\n\nI know one of you will want the TLDR of the story, so I've put it in poem format:\n\nRoses are red,\nRick James does slouch,\nRead the damn story,\nOr fuck yo' couch\n\nI'm a real Bob Frost, I know.\n\nAnd be honest about if you didn't like it, or if something was so terribly off that it needs correcting.  I welcome criticism.  I won't recommend any music, but let's just say when I was writing Heavy's stuff, I played the \"Pacific Rim Main Theme\" because that's all I could think about:  two massive beasts clashing and destroying all the things.\n\n\nOther than that, enjoy!  \n\n\n(Remember that Patrick O'Malley and his daughter are Irish, so accent it up, people!)\n\n---\n\n\"Wipe that shit-eating grin off your face, little one,\"  Patrick said with a smirk.  \"I am not going to tell it again.  Papa is too tired.\"\n\nThe red-headed, freckled girl stood up on the tavern stool and whined, \"Pleeeeeeeeease?\"\n\n\"No.  Now sit down or you only get half a pint today.\"\n\nWith a glint in her eye and a smile on her face, she stood on the bar.  Patrick sighed, \"Here we go...\"  He quickly finished his drink.\n\nHer voice didn't carry far, but she proclaimed, \"Listen up, you shits!\"  Heads turned, all eyes were on her, and silence filled the air. She took a gulp of beer and continued, \"The greatest evil Faerun has seen in generations was on your very doorstep!  The armies of the greatest nations in all the land united as one and took the fight to the Cult of the Dragon.  Six heroes were tasked with infiltrating and stopping the evil goddess, Tiamat, from being summoned.  My papa is one of those heroes.  And he will tell the tale!\" She looked up at him doe-eyed with a grin from ear-to-ear.\n\nThrough gritted teeth Patrick whispered, \"No more beer for you.  And by the way,\" he mused, \"you will be a better storyteller than me one day.\"  He winked and stood up.\n\nWith great bravado and projection in his voice, a talent his daughter had yet to achieve, Patrick began to spin his yarn:  \"Ladies and gentlemen, while it is true I was present at the failed ritual to summon Tiamat, my daughter is somewhat mistaken.  I am no hero.  I am merely an historian:  keeping track of great events in Faerun and making sure that all know the sacrifice and bravery of true heroes.\"\n\nPatrick turned his gaze downward at and frowned, \"It took a combined effort of each nation's army and a small infiltration force to interrupt the summoning ritual of Tiamat.\"  With solemn still in his voice, he looked up, \"Never forget those thousands who died making sure the strike team could make it to the summoning chamber.  They are the unnamed heroes that should always be remembered.\n\n\"By now, you've certainly heard of:  \n\n- Kolixen  the Dragonborn Archer - capable of striking foes at the most impossible of distances\n- Heavy the Human Warrior - raging barbarian that mows down multiple enemies in one swing\n- Oz the Gnome Wizard - master of elements and seeker of arcane knowledge\n- Reverence the Tiefling Warlock - blasts enemies with eldritch magic and strikes fear into the hearts of her foes\n- Hadeus the Elven Sword Master - rivals even the great Drizzt Do'urden with his sword play\n\n\"These are the heroes... no... these are the legends who were entrusted by the leaders of Faerun to sneak into the cult's base of operations and stop the summoning ritual... at any cost necessary.\n\n\"Langdedrosa, a dragonborn legend in his own right, volunteered to accompany us on this crucial mission.  He had assisted us several times in the past with stopping cult operations; we were glad he would be joining us.\n\n\"With the majority of cult forces distracted by the Faerunian army, we were able to make our way to a secret entrance that lead right into the summoning chamber... well, it was less an entrance and more an adjacent wall... we simply made it an entrance.  Now, I had two main tasks for the ensuing battle:  the first was to make sure my allies didn't get grievously wounded, and if they did, I was to restore them back to life.  My second job... now that was an interesting one.\n\n\"You see, I dabble in the magical arts.  I am not as inherently skillful as a sorcerer or versatile as a wizard when it comes to magic.  However, I've picked up a thing or two along the way.  My job was to turn Heavy the Indomitable into a giant, man-crushing, dragon-punching ape.\n\n\"First, he drank a potion to make him grow twice in size, and then I turned him into a hairy, death-dealing gorilla whose sole purpose was to weak havoc and destruction upon his foes... who, we had hoped, he didn't assume was us.  Since, as rumor has it (because I spread that rumor), Heavy is not the most intelligent of creatures.  Luckily for us, he smashed through the wall and the battle to stop Tiamat's rise had begun.\n\n\"We rushed in only to see a great chamber before us.  The room was 200 feet long and the vaulted ceiling: 150 feet high.  Cultists, scattered about the area, were channeling into a portal located on the opposite side of the room.  We heard a faint roar from the portal, and that could only mean one thing:  time was waning.\n\n\"After being alerted to our presence (which was as soon as Heavy, the giant ape, burst through the wall), a green dragon swooped down upon us, and the cultists turned invisible, disappearing from sight.  The massive ape rushed towards the dragon picking up a nearby boulder and throwing it at the green monstrosity.  The dragon reeled back, but kept coming.  A flurry of arrows rung from the bows of Kolixen and Hadeus and the projectiles met their target with precision and accuracy.  Bloodied, battered, but not broken, the green beast let forth a great bellow and acid spewed from it's maw.  Most of the acid was absorbed by the thick hide of our gorilla companion, and the rest fell harmlessly to the floor.\n\n\"With the dragon's ire and rage focused on Heavy, it was time for Reverence Cult-Foe to shine.  Now, you must understand, Reverence has the uncanny ability to see those who do not wish to be seen.  An ability that would put the cult at a distinct disadvantage.  With a smirk on her face, she began the hunt...\n\n\"Eldritch magic blasted from her wand and smashed into an invisible cultist.  With a loud *thunk*, the now visible body lay dormant on the ground.  Reverence had made her first kill of the battle, but the reaping of souls had just begun.\n\n\"Oz the Great and Powerful launched rays of fire into the wounded green dragon.  The beast began its final charge towards the group, steadily picking up speed, scales still smoking from Oz's assault.  It let out a great bellow and took a bite out of Heavy.  To the great ape, it was merely a glancing blow.  Heavy returned in kind with two massive punches to the dragon's head, killing it before its body hit the ground........  Without warning, a door swung open on the opposite side of the room: three more dragons came flying out:  red, green, and blue.  The fight was far from over.\n\n\"Langdedrosa, who was seemingly a non-factor in the battle thus far, remained by the wall we entered through; it seemed almost as if he was observing.  He lifted his arms to the sky, looked up, and his body began to glow a bright blue.\n\n\"We began our setup for the ensuing bout; we had to protect Reverence because she was our only hope at finding the summoners.  Kolixen the Venerated, astride her bronze dragon, Ornsaj, took to the sky to intercept the green dragon; she drew her bow back waiting for the right moment.  Heavy pounded his chest and began ascending the nearest column.  Oz and I stepped backwards, still concentrating on our respective spells, but ready to assail our enemies with fire and assault their minds.  I attempted to inspire my companions to guard their hearts from the fear that may be instilled within them; for we have faced menaces greater than these and we have always won the day!\n\n\"Hadeus Dragonbane, though... Hadeus went into an intense fervor.  For across the room was his nemesis and sworn enemy: Lennithon, the blue dragon.  Their eyes met, Lennithon let out a mighty roar, and broke formation.  The blue dragon rocketed towards Hadeus with a righteous fury.  Unfortunately for the blue monster, Heavy timed his jump perfectly and smashed into Lennithon's side causing both gigantic beasts to tumble to the ground.  Hadeus sidestepped the falling dragon and drew both scimitars; he plunged them into Lennithon's back causing the blue beast to roar in agony.  It swiped ferociously at Hadeus and managed to claw a gaping gash into his abdomen.  The dragon went in for the bite, but Heavy used his powerful fists to strike Lennithon before the killing blow to Hadeus.  Lennithon blindly expelled his lightning breath and while it missed Heavy, Hadeus took a good portion of it.  He was launched into a column and knocked unconscious.\n\n\"With Hadeus severely injured, Reverence temporarily stopped her cultist killing spree (her count was three for those keeping track at home), and ran over to him.  I met her there and managed to close the wound until it was merely another faint scar on his body; I was then able to wake him.  I ordered her to get Hadeus out of there; she grabbed him tightly and teleported across the room.\n\n\"Kolixen fired two arrows in rapid succession while Ornsaj let loose a breath of lightning:  turning the arrows into electrified projectiles.  The synchronization between rider and dragon was astounding; not a word was spoken and yet they moved, attacked, and acted as one.  The combination of arrows and lightning caused the green dragon to stagger mid-air, but it caught itself and returned a breath weapon of its own.  Acid sprayed wildly and Ornsaj valiantly put himself between the acid and Kolixen.  The green dragon flew upward and took two vicious swings of its claws and a bite at Ornsaj.  The acid had done significant damage to the bronze dragon's scales leaving it vulnerable, and Ornsaj could not withstand the flurry of claws and teeth.  His eyes rolled back... his body went limp... and he began to fall as blood fell from the sky.  Ornsaj, the only dragon to defy his masters and join us in the confrontation... his final act was to sacrifice himself for Kolixen:  a woman whom he cared greatly for and who cared greatly for him.  \n\n\"Oz quickly cast a slowing spell on the now grief stricken, but more importantly, enraged, Kolixen... her eyes began to glow a mysterious and vivid blue.  Oz then waved his wand and an encircling cloud above the green dragon formed.  With a flick of the wrist, a raging storm of ice and hail began to smash and pierce the dragon's thick scales.  It roared in pain as it landed and staggered its way out of the tempest.  Oz smirked as he strategically backed into the hallway.\n\n\"Lennithon was determined to get to Hadeus, even if it meant having to get hit a few times from Heavy, the gargantuan gorilla.  Having been teleported, Hadeus was safe for the time being, but it wouldn't be long before the blue dragon was upon him again.  Heavy was not about to let that happen.  As Lennithon tried to fly away from the ape, he felt a tug on his tail and he was whipped into a nearby column, causing it to crumble and crash to the ground.  Lennithon clawed and thrashed at Heavy, and the massive ape lost his grip.  The chase was on.\n\n\"Lennithon flew as Heavy climbed up another column and traversed the ceiling.  Lennithon, staggered by the beating he had already taken, was flying at a slower speed, but Heavy had a lot of ground... or ceiling in this case... to cover.  Lennithon dove right for Hadeus and in a final desperate gambit, our heroic ceiling-spanning gorilla made the jump from 150 feet in the air aiming directly at the blue dragon.\n\n\"Hadeus found his bearings and began hunting cultists with Reverence, unaware of the threat looming above him.  He sunk his scimitar into the abdomen of one cultist as a blast of force flew right by his face.  He glared back at Reverence who blew him a kiss, winked, and pointed in his direction.  He looked past the cultist he had just slain and there was another lying dead on the floor.  That's when he heard it: a loud whooshing that was only getting louder.  Without looking above, he began to run towards Reverence.  She looked up and saw the menace that was quickly approaching and sprinted towards Hadeus.  The dragon was nearly upon them and Reverence's eyes began to widen as she reached out and grabbed Hadeus's outstretched hand.  The moment she felt his smooth, elven skin she teleported them back to their original location.  \n\n\"Lennithon let out a booming roar... well, half of a booming roar as the wind was sucked out of his lungs as a one ton gorilla landed on top of him.  Heavy punched, stomped, bit, and kicked the blue dragon.  Lennithon was not finished yet and raged fueled his attacks:  he clawed, bit, tail whipped, and wing smashed the bloodied and bruised ape.  The two gargantuan beasts were locked in an epic battle.  Heavy grabbed and threw the dragon into a wall causing debris and dust to fill the air.  The dragon, now incensed that this ape had lost him his quarry twice, flew into Heavy and smashed him against a column, causing it to crumble to the ground.  The two went back and forth throughout the room destroying all in their wake.  Dust began to fill the chamber and the fight between gorilla and dragon would last several more minutes.\n\n\"The red was the most cunning dragon that day.  It waited until we were weakened and made a strafing run with its fire breath.  It launched from its perch and fire surrounded us.  Choking smoke and hot embers filled the air; it was getting hard to breathe.  It landed next to the green and they fixated their gaze upon Kolixen...\n\n\"Kolixen's eyes were glowing a bright blue and her body began to rise slightly off the ground.  I looked over to Langdedrosa, a hero in his own right, as he, too, was levitating off the ground.  It seemed as though he was channeling some sort draconic magic into Kolixen.  The dragons rushing towards her hesitated for just a moment and with a blue, fiery explosion Langdedrosa's body slumped to the ground and an ethereal blue mist encircled and absorbed into Kolixen's body.  Just as Ornsaj gave his life for Kolixen, so, too, did Langdedrosa.\n\n\"Her body began to contort as the blue mist covered her like a cocoon.  Upon breaking free, we realized that Kolixen, as we knew her, was no more.  In her place, a fully adult bronze dragon stood: in all her glory and majesty, wrath and fury in her eyes, every scale hardened, every claw sharpened, every muscle taut.  She let out a roar that shook the very foundation beneath our feet.  Lightning came forth from her maw and crackled towards red and green.  Their attempts to dodge it was futile at best; they were both caught in plasma that tore into their thick hide.\n\n\"For a moment, all was quiet.  The dragons were sizing each other up and through the dust emerged Lennithon .... or so we thought.  It was actually his carcass being held by none other than Heavy.  Breathing heavily and limping, the gorilla threw the dead dragon at the feet of the red and green dragons.  I seized the opportunity from our brief respite to inspire our beleaguered party,and strike fear into the hearts of those who would bring about the destruction of the world:\n\n\n\n**'And so here we stand.  The vanguards of Faerun... her protectors.  Here we stand.  Before us... an ever opening portal with the greatest evil about to emerge from it.   Only together can we destroy this menace, and only together can we reclaim the lives we each lost... the lives that were taken from us!  It would be no greater honor than to die amongst those I consider my family, but as long as I draw breath, I will do everything in my power to make sure that bitch doesn't get through!  Now, who here will stand and fight with me?!  Who here will fight and die with me?!'**\n\n\n\"Heavy pounded his chest and Kolixen let out a terrifying roar.  I nodded to Reverence and Hadeus; their jobs were clear:  kill the remaining cultists.  I would provide support for the group, and Oz, Heavy, and Kolixen would stall the dragons as long as possible.\n\n\"Of course, with every plan, there can be... setbacks.  Heavy was bombarded fireballs from the channeling mages.  He turned and charged; it's hard to blame him, he was an ape, after all.  Hadeus and Reverence made chase to assist and Oz and Kolixen were to keep the dragons at bay.\n\n\"Oz let out several streaks of fire from his wand and they exploded into the green dragon.  It's scales started to become brittle from the heat... a condition that Kolixen would take advantage of.  She clawed ferociously at green, seemingly quite comfortable with her new form.  She shredded through green's scales as though they weren't even there.  Massive gashes across the beasts chest and flanks began to hemorrhage blood.  As it turned to retreat, she bit down on the back of its neck and with pure might flung the monster to the ground.  This was the bastard who killed Ornsaj, and she would make him suffer for it...\n\n\"Heavy was still getting bombarded with fire, but it allowed him to see where the channeling mages were located... at least the general vicinity.  He swung blindly and a few moments later a cultist went smashing into the wall.  Hadeus and Reverence had a more tactical and decisive approach to killing the rest of the cultists.  Reverence would expose them with eldritch magic, Hadeus would finish them off with a flash of steel.  Reverence seemed to be enjoying herself a bit too much, if you ask me...\n\n\"With the cultists getting overwhelmed and quickly dispatched, I turned my attention to the red and green dragons.  Despite being outnumbered, Kolixen was handling them well.  She had green pinned under her massive claws, and red was slashing and biting to no avail... her hide was too thick.  This allowed Oz to launch volleys of magic at the dragons unimpeded.  Storms of ice and wind slammed into the duo, and blasts of fire and lightning exploded and crackled.  Indeed, it seemed as though we finally had the advantage in this battle.\n\n\"Kolixen, with a mighty stomp, crushed green under her talons, extinguishing the life from its eyes.  Heavy slammed and flailed wildly smashing cultists left and right.  His hide was ripped, cut, burned, bruised, and battered, but fueled by his rage, he felt no pain.  Hadeus and Reverence masterfully dispatched the remaining cultists and Oz launched his final salvo of magic at the red dragon.  Red began to take flight to escape, but I entered its mind with whispers of despair and hopelessness.  The red monstrosity, overwhelmed by the mental assault, crashed into a wall and careened towards the earth.  Kolixen made chase, but she was rapidly changing back to her dragonkin form.  The red dragon pulled itself up and began to take flight once more.  Kolixen, now fully herself, leapt onto its back.\n\n\"As Red took off, it quickly spun quickly in midair, performing a perfect aileron roll.  Almost as if anticipating this move, however, Kolixen managed to keep herself moving towards the dragon's head, and still atop the dragon's now exposed underbelly.  As she ran forward, Kolixen pulled the draconic spear from her back.  The red leviathan began to spin back around.  This time, Kolixen leapt, letting the dragon's spin carry her momentum forward.  She quickly turned mid-air, spear in hand, and cried out: 'Tiamat's eyes shine!'  The spear began to glow blindingly bright and she drove it into the dragon's chest, piercing the heart.  Both she and the dragon fell from the sky, but only Kolixen got back up.\n\n\"With no more targets to kill, Heavy returned to his normal form.  We ran over to the portal, now shrinking by the second.  We all peered down and saw the five headed goddess, Tiamat, clawing her way up from the nine hells.  She blasted fire upwards in a futile attempt to dispatch us.  Breathing heavily and roaring mightily, the goddess clambered higher and higher, but try as she might, the portal was closing too quickly for her to reach it.\n\n\"We looked at each other smirking, some of us laughing.  I took out my flask and poured a bit of whiskey down the portal.  Tiamat let out a final roar and I asked, 'What's that?  I can't-' the portal closed, 'hear you!'\n\n\"And with that, my friends, Tiamat's rise had been stopped.  Remember those legends who saved you from this threat:\n\n- Kolixen the Venerated - master bowman, beloved by metallic dragons\n- Heavy the Indomitable - master of combat, pretty sure one of his parents is a bear\n- Reverence Cult-Foe - master of eldritch might, reaper of souls\n- Oz the Great and Powerful - master of magic, lover of complicated solutions\n- Hadeus Dragonbane - master of dueling, slayer of dragons\n\nThese are the heroes who sacrificed everything normal in life to ensure the safety of Faerun and even Toril, itself.  Honor them, remember them.\"\n\nPatrick sat back down surrounded by cheers and accolades; he found his daughter grinning at him.  \"What now?\"\n\n\"Nooooothing,\" she smiled.\n\nPatrick looked in her mug, \"You drank the whole pint, didn't you?\"\n\n\"Maaaaaybe.\"\n\nPatrick couldn't help but laugh, \"You know, Elle, one of these days I'm going get angry when you don't listen to me.\"\n\nShe knew exactly what ruffled her papa's feathers, \"Like when I want to kiss a boy?\"\n\nHis eyes widened, \"Boys?!  What boys?!  There's no boys.  No. No. No. No. No. That's not happening. Ever.  You are joining convent when you are old enough, young lady!  In fact, that's where we are going right after I get one more drink.\"  They both laughed heartily, as they so often did.\n\nHe looked down at her and smiled.  Despite all he had been through:  the cult, the dragons, the monsters, the beasts, the fall of Phlan, having a tavern collapse on top of him, an evil goddess minutes away from destroying everything.  Despite all of that, he was glad the biggest worry of his life right now was boys hanging around his daughter.  But who knows, maybe having a daughter will be a bigger challenge than anything he's faced before.\n",

This plotline culminated in an encounter in Xen'drik where the patron was partially reshaped into a Rakshasa-like form.  The kalashtar had blasted away at him with telekinetic powers, the warforged juggernaut smashed with his battlefist, the sorcerer spammed evocation spells... all seemed to either be resisted or had such a negligible effect that they may not have happened at all.  Finally, the bard cast... hideous laughter.  He rolled spell resistance.  Pierced.  I rolled the save... two.  With his +12 to will saves... he failed.  This is a transcript of the following scene.\n\nRajah: \"DOO HOO HOO HOOOO!\"\n\nBard: \"Quick!  Get him in the bag of holding!\"\n\nSorcerer: \"I have it!  Hand me the dagger!\"\n\nKalashtar: \"Faster, faster!\"\n\nWarforged: \"I don't get the joke.\"\n\nThey pulled a bag of holding over the laughing Rakshasa and cut it, sending him into the Astral Plane for all time.

Half of our party was still outside the room, so the rest of us began fighting for our lives. We had a really tough time with the wraiths, who were doing cold damage and Con drain as well. \n\nThe rogue, on the other hand, went invisible and went for the table of loot in the back of the room.\n\nHe touched a gem and set off a chain lightning trap. Our DM began laughing maniacally. Those who could make a DC 21 Reflex save would take 24 damage. Those who couldn't would take 48. Two characters took enough damage to die, though one saved himself with hero points. I got knocked to within 3 HP of death. The thief managed to make his save, and he had evasion, so he took no damage. \n\nThen the DM realized that the chain lightning would have targeted the wraiths as well. We all started laughing, as the wraiths could have possibly killed another several characters, and the DM himself burst out laughing, saying that he couldn't believe that we would manage to take out the monsters using his own trap.",

        "text": "So I'm close to the end of my first campaign. In my head, this campaign was way more dark and cool, but it's become quite something else once my players got a hold of it. \n\n**A bit of backstory:** My BBEG is an Elvish king by the name of Ocullo, who refers to himself as The Void King since he is neither alive nor dead anymore, and his kingdom is sealed away outside of reality, and the forested valley it used to be in is awash with anomalies that distort time and space, trapping everyone inside its borders. During the first time they saw him, I described him as being humanoid, but with the edges of his body exuding wisps of dark smoke. \n\nMy players henceforth christened him \"Fart King\". This sets the tone for the rest of the campaign.\n\n**The party:**\n\n* **Flora**, amorous Satyr Druid with a childlike outlook on life. She carries a bag of seeds (Called her bag of fucks, she plants one every time she has sex)\n* **Fauna**, elder sister of Flora, a Half-Elf Druid who is perpetually the responsible one. Wields a powerful Staff of the Woodlands (This is important)\n* **Jasper Holton**, a budding Wild Mage, still coming to terms with his growing magic power. Occasionally he turns into a plant. \n* **Kargath Blackscale**, a bounty-hunting, (formerly black, now iridescent purple) Dragonborn Ranger with ALMOST enough Int. Almost.\n* **Thane Elmdor**, a Tiefling Eldritch Knight. Late to the party, he's a jerk with heart. He wants to get out of the valley.\n* **Angus**, my DMPC, a Wizard who tried to retire and become a carriage driver with his beloved horses, Bonnie and Belle, before getting roped into this adventure.  He mostly just drives the cart around and converses with the party during rests. His first cart was destroyed, and his second brutally made into a convertible. Flora, growing attached to him, used a lot of druid magic and her bag of fucks to build a living canopy around his cart.\n\n**At the beginning of the encounter:** The party had just defeated a dungeon I created, received a piece of the puzzle on how they defeat the BBEG. Angus, who tends to wait outside dungeons with his cart and horses, was getting nervous due to a clearly magical storm gathering over the floating island that the dungeon was on. When the party emerged, he urged them to book it off the floating island. \n\nAt this point, the recurring Boss NPC I had, a Knight who drives a chariot with two Nightmares enters the scene, driving in from the distance. Knight keeps their distance, firing arrows at the cart from afar, kicking off the encounter with a surprise attack that buries two arrows into the cart. Knight keeps their distance throughout the fight, setting off alarm bells with the party, because they usually clash up close with their oft-returning foe.\n\nAt this point, I put Angus on autopilot, basically he'd listen to any driving directions given to him, but his main goal, in character and out, was to get across the bridge attaching the floating island to the actual ground. The party did not know that I had basically trapped the entire encounter. \n\nThe arrows the Knight fired emanated an Anti-Magic field upon impact in a 10ft radius. They could be removed, broken, or tossed away to end the effect, but the knight had a bottomless quiver of them. The party figured this out by round 2 of combat. What they didn't figure out in time was that the bridge was booby trapped with tons of those arrows (300ft bridge, the arrows alternated sides, one every 5 feet or so for a total of 60). Thane even tried to roll perception to see if the bridge was sabotaged before they got in, but he didn't roll high enough to see the arrows. \n\n**What I had planned on happening** was the party getting funneled onto the bridge because it's the only exit from the island that's not straight down. Then the Knight stops at the edge, cutting the bridge, tossing the party. Everyone falls, a great deal of damage is dealt, enough to wound everyone severely, and killing Bonnie and Belle, Angus's horses, outright. \n\nThis, once everyone recovers, would cause the conscious party members to find Angus, kneeling next to the mangled remains of his cart, his two horses dead from the impact. He would then suffer a horrible loss of morale and go manic in his attempts to beg the party to save them, trying to invoke their time travel macguffins (Which, due to the rules of how they work, wouldn't function at that location) Someone, hopefully, would calm him down, but he would have suffered the final blow to his willpower. \n\nThe party would rest, probably, and then they'd walk along the bottom of the ravine before being presented with a choice to leave the valley they were trapped in. For whatever reason, the magic preventing them from leaving would be gone. Angus would somberly continue walking to apparently leave the campaign, and we cut there for the night on that dark cliffhanger. \n\n**What actually happened** was that the party figures out how to remove the arrows and this puts them at about half spell efficiency since they're constantly pulling the arrows out while the Knight remains mostly out of their range. They get to the bridge, and realize that its trapped with the Anti-Magic arrows. Instead of trying to stop and get off right off the bridge, they try to cross it in time, getting about halfway across before they realize that the Knight isn't going to chase them onto it. \n\nIt's going to just cut the bridge. \n\nJasper has a revelation and leaps from the bridge before casting his fly spell as soon as he's out of range of the AM field. This reactivates his casting ability. A round passes and the knight hacks off one side of the bridge supports. Enough people make their Dex saves to keep the cart from sliding off. Fauna decides to bail out the cart, using her staff as a sort of safe landing point by invoking its tree-transformation ability to create a wedge between the ravine walls. \n\nAt this point, Flora who had been the most stifled by the Anti-Magic field, has a revelation. She apologizes to Angus, who's driving his horses as hard as they can go to get across the bridge. She wraps one arm around Angus and yells \"Sorry!\" before yanking him away from his reins, leaving his beloved horses to almost certain doom as she uses a jump spell to bound off of Fauna's tree-staff, taking Angus to safety as he screams bloody murder, calling out to his horses as he is taken away from them.\n\n**At this point** I'm convinced everything is going according to plan, Angus is about to get his heroic loss, and the party will cry real tears as I play through his heartbreak. **NOPE**\n\n**Jasper Holton has a brilliant idea.** With Flora and Fauna creating their own safe escapes, and Angus safely out of danger, he [After his player reads and rereads his class and spells] realizes he can SAVE THEM. By burning all his sorcery points, he can recover his slowfall spell for up to five CREATURES. Not players, not people, CREATURES. He orders Kargath and Thane to climb onto the horses, cut their reins (A very important action, since there was still an Anti-Magic arrow embedded in the cart that nobody saw land), and make the horses jump. \n\nIn one swift action, he manages to save the horses, their riders, and end the encounter, as they were out of the Knight's range, and the Knight wouldn't dare cross the bridge in the state it was in. \n\nAt this point, I'm too thrilled from everyone's actions to care that my heroic loss was ruined. Angus is hugging Flora and Jasper for saving him and his horses. The party regroups at the bottom of the ravine, everyone descending in their own manner (Flora holding Angus and using her still-active jump spell to jump down the cliff-face safely, Fauna with her staff, Jasper flying, and the rest falling slowly down. \n\n**Regrouped at the bottom**, Angus is thrilled that his beloved horses are still alive, thanking the group profusely. After a rest, there's a touching moment where Angus, grateful to Flora and all she's done, retrieves one of the saplings she grew on his cart to give to her. The party sets out, walking along the ravine until they come to a clear end of it. On the cliff face, there's a navigable path that will lead back up and into the valley. In front of them, there is a clear exit to the valley they've all been trapped in. The party almost doesn't believe it, and I have to explain it several times. No fog, no tricks. You can see all the way out of the valley. The sun is shining there. Grass is growing. Jaws drop.\n\nThane wants to leave because that's mostly what he wanted to do from the beginning. Flora wants to leave because she's tired and scared of the valley and how twisted it is. The rest of the party thinks they should stay, and there's a debate over whether the exit is a trap. Eventually the general mood switches to stay. It's at that point Angus decides to begin the slow trek up the cliff path. \n\n**Jasper kicks off a speech** about how The Fart King (because I have accepted it at this point) is afraid of them, and giving them an easy way out is the only way he can hope to win. As he's talking, [I click on some inspirational music.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5lsRk8G4OE)\n\nThane decides to stay because if the villain is scared, well, let's go get him. Kargath decides to stay because he's going to collect a bounty in this valley one way or another and if there's even a way for him to, he's gonna cut the king's head off. Fauna decides to stay because the valley forest is still twisted, and if they don't do anything, all the forests will be that way. Angus decides to stay because goddammit, he's an adventurer, and the party helped him see that he never stopped being one. He looks at Flora, the last one to chime in, telling her that everyone needs her, too. She stops, looks down, thinks about what she's going to say for a moment. Then she looks at everyone and decides that if running away is the childish thing to do, then it's time for her to grow up. The party looks at each other, nods, and starts up the path. \n\nAnd that's how them ruining my plans was the best thing ever.",
