        "text": "From gameplay perspective there is little to no difference between auction house and a shop which sells and buys every tradeable item in the game. It often leads to situations where majority of the content in a game becomes irrelevant since you can bypass most of the game by utilizing auction house to acquire high tier items. Another aspect to it is that it's better use of your time to focus on activities which generate wealth so you can buy what you need from auction house instead of trying to get the item yourself.\n\nTrading of course has it's place in a game but removing the interactive part of the trade means it would be the same to do the transaction with an NPC. Without auction house there tends to be 3rd party site which works as the auction house in a game. Even then it requires a bit of effort to use which means that you won't bother with the cheapest of items but it still has basically all the same issues as in-game auction house would have.\n\n\nI've yet to see an auction house which would enrich the playing experience and there aren't all that many games which would offer a way to circumvent the 3rd party auction house while still having free trade in the game.\n\n\nWhat I'd love to see is very active trading communities within guilds for example which would work well enough to kill the need for 3rd party auction house while still limiting the negative aspects of an auction house.",

        "text": "I may not have a fancy YouTube channel or be partnered with a game reviewing platform like IGN but that doesn't mean I can't think as critically of a game as them. I have been studying game design and what constitutes a good game for around 4 years now and with the reviews of Forza Horizon 4 just being released early today I lost any sense of hope in gaming journalism.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe game seems to have an average rating of 9.0-9.6, this means insert your favorite game (here) and an annual racing game is better than it. I need to explain some things about myself for better context, I am a car nut I own 7+ cars and am in my early 20's. I played Forza sine horizon 1 '6 years ago' and have bought almost every game since. My favorite Horizon 2 I played for a year straight and clocked over 1000 hours in. So what I say in the future please understand what I say is not from blind hate but from pure disappointment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs mentioned I played 1000+ hours of Horizon 2, when horizon 3 was released I bought it day one and was so excited to get into it but I quickly realized the game was just a reskin of the first game with a new map and a few new cars. The map was actually the same size as 2 and many fans think overall worse than 2 because a large portion of it was just dirt roads. I played maybe 10 hours of Horizon 3. That was the last Forza I'd buy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now 2 years later and here we are at the launch of Horizon 4, while the game does admittedly look like the best Horizon game yet that is hard to do considering the previous best games came out 4-6 years ago and all that they needed to do was listen to any of the fan feedback whatsoever they accumulate on their forums. The main selling piece is the seasons this year, and while the feature is incredible it is the only selling piece of the game. There is of course a few new cars and a body kit or two but even the HUD is the same, the decal editor the same, the tuning the same, the parts list the same. Forza is not a franchise that only reuses assets but they literally recycle 90% of the games programming yearly, bugs on cars that existed 5 years ago still rear their head in the newer games proving the assets are direct copy paste. Now of course I having nothing against this practice as long as it is used to add more content to the game but the way they do it is to not add content but to be the only content. Need proof? Just watch gameplay while the graphics get better yearly the car models sound and physics stay 100% the same through releases.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's not a conspiracy they reuse assets and they'd be dumb not to but when people drool over the car list understand that if you buy 5 Forza games in a way you are paying for same piece of the game 5 times. When they say hey our new game has 450 cars I say really that's it? Forza Motorsport 4 released 7 years ago had 650 cars. Again I don't care they do this but what I'm trying to convey is that we need to judge other pieces of the game to see if it's worth our money not the car list, paint editor, upgrade shop, photo mode, etc. So let's do that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat it comes down to is going to be the map and this year admittedly the map is pretty decent compared to the flat dusty desert that was the previous game, the size looks to be as big or even smaller than the previous 2 games but it had to be modeled and textured 4 times so that is partly forgiven. Okay so we have established the map is good and combined with all the tried and true Forza assets dating back a decade with a decade of polish surely this game is a good game right? Yes from my experience with the Forza franchise I think this is one of the better ones but that begs the question should a game with basically 10% new assets be rated a higher score than the Witcher 3 or Skyrim? Absolutely not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could see this game being rated a 9 or even 9.2 if it was the first in the franchise but since Forza Horizon 1,2,3 exist it would be disingenuous to not compare this game to those. So if a game comes out of the blue and boasts a car list of nearly 450 it's amazing but when all the previous games had that much or more cars like Motorsport 4 did 7 years ago with 650 it actually subtracts from the rating to me, mainly because they try and resell you those cars as DLC despite you may guess being about 95% ported over assets from year old games that you already payed for. Speaking of DLC I guess I forgot to mention how Forza is a very anti-consumer game, not only do they have day one DLC but also steep preorder bonuses. Want to wait until a game is released to see amateur game reviewers take it on because you don't trust a random person at IGN rating it 3 points higher the Witcher 3? Well then have fun losing 7 yes 7 cars. The game is not even out but hey already have 6 pieces of day one DLC. If you don't pay the $100.00 you will miss out on another 10 cars. Oh and by the way these 17 cars are counted for in their 450 figure meaning you actually get around 430 if you get the game standard. And the nail in the coffin is those 17 cars are usually the best and most unique in the game and are the ones new to the franchise so the other 430 cars are mostly the recycled ones from 5 years+ ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when rating this game based on whats new and what it does against it's competitors on the market mainly being the previous 2 versions of the series itself I say the game gets no more than an 8.0 not the 9.6 IGN gave it. As much of a car nerd I am this game is certainly not better than Skyrim, Witcher, and is not 1 point away From Red Dead Redemption.",

Mobile games and cell phones are a huge factor in this, as most consumers already own a device capable of many things, including playing a wide variety of games, for very cheap prices. \n\nFor those not in the know, emulators on mobile devices are getting insane. \n\nPPSSPP, and most consoles up to the 5th generation are fairly easy to run on any modern device. Dolphin, amazingly, is making it's way to being fully playable within a few years, with playable results already being achieved. Playing Resident Evil 4 on your mobile device is now a reality, and to me, that's pretty crazy. \n\nGiven the power of mobile devices, do you think companies could go with an official emulator route, which is a lot cheaper to make and distribute than a console, will be viable or something they'd consider in the future? \n\nWe're in an era where companies love to port any and all games they can for a cheap buck, and mobile devices have already seen their fare share of ports. I think a frontend like an emulator would allow for the process to speed up, and make that \"quick buck\" exponentially easier to make. ",

Gamers meet up to play their favorite games, to participate in tournaments, to meet their online friends and, of course, to party.\n\nLast year I've been to at least four LAN parties with a minimum of 500 players each, this October the biggest LAN party in Switzerlan with 2500 people will open its doors and there is no end to the parties in sight.\n\nThere is also the Dreamhack organization, which organizes the biggest LAN parties all over the world.\n\nSo are those just sensationalist statements of a few frustrated gamers online who don't have any events nearby or am I just lucky enough to live in an area where people still get together to play?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Spelling",

        "author": "raff_riff",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/9ikcc6/games_that_lie_or_otherwise_intentionally_deceive/",
        "text": "**Spoilers ahead for Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, especially in the comments**\n\nHey all. I want to talk about a really interesting mechanic I experienced with Hellblade where, in short, the game literally lies to its players. First I want to go into detail about this mechanic and then open it up for discussion, and see if there's other games out there that do something similar. \n\nSo I just beat Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. The story, music, sound, gameplay, combat mechanics, and portrayal of mental illness all blew me away. It's the first game I've played in years that I couldn't (and can't) stop thinking about after I put it down. Not since The Last of Us or BioShock has a game had such an impact on me. Seriously, if you haven't played it yet, do yourself a favor and make some time for it. And wear a headset!\n\nAnyway it wasn't until I went to the wikipedia page for the game to do some follow-up research that I read about a concept that really floored me. **Again, spoilers ahead**...\n\nThe \"game\" doesn't interact with you much. There's no tutorial, no HUD, and, other than some credits in the beginning, almost no text on screen ever. Button mapping is only told to you by viewing the pause menu. Combat combos and other tricks have to be learned on the fly. Except one occasion...\n\nIn the player's first experience to combat, you die. You have to die (sort of like the first few minutes of a Dark Souls game). As you \"respawn\", your character realizes it was just a hallucination. However, a \"rot\" appears on Senua's hand, manifested in a black, vine-like disease that creeps from her fingertips and up her hand. Dramatic text then appears on the screen; for the first and only time, the player is addressed by the \"game\" itself: \n\n&gt;\t“DARK ROT WILL GROW EACH TIME YOU FAIL. IF THE ROT REACHES SENUA’S HEAD, HER QUEST IS OVER. AND ALL PROGRESS WILL BE LOST.”\n\nAnd so the stakes are set. Die too much and, presumably, your save file is lost and you start from scratch. Considering the game auto-saves every few minutes or at certain checkpoints and, well, the contract has been signed.\n\nSuddenly every decision mattered. Every parry, riposte, dodge, or slash... every stumble, fall, misstep... had consequences. Not “Dark Souls” type of consequences where you lose your bank of souls and can’t level up or buy new gear until you get it back. Real, permanent consequences. If you die, the game enters a short sequence where you see the rot creep further up her arm, reminding you that your fate is sealed. \n\nI really felt the weight and intensity of each fight. My heart would beat out of my chest with a rush of adrenaline from a game I’d not felt since I used to play MMORPGs online. I found that I’d stop breathing during certain moments. After certain fights, I’d let out a huge sigh of relief and slump back in my sofa, literally relieved I’d made it through another challenge without the rot creeping closer to Senua’s head.\n\nBut I failed. A lot. By the end of the game, the rot had gotten to Senua’s shoulder and, presumably, her upper chest or neck. I expected with just a few more deaths, I’d begin to see it crawl out from under her armor and up her neck and soon, her head. I was cutting it close. But I eked out a win and made it through the final confrontation without Senua being fully corrupted and losing my save file. Another video game notch in the belt. \n\n**Then I found out it was all a lie.** As it turns out, this is a mechanic imposed by the developers to instill a sense of dread, panic, paranoia, and worry. And in my opinion, they absolutely nailed it. Here’s a section from the wikipedia article on the game about this mechanic:\n\n&gt;\t[...] several media outlets later found out that the rot stops spreading after a certain amount of deaths, and cannot progress further before a certain point in the game, ultimately making it impossible for it to reach Senua’s head.\n\n&gt;\t[...] Eurogamer called it “a cool trick that makes the player feel a sense of dread as they’re playing the game. Dread, anxiety and death are all themes Hellblade revolves around. It certainly fits”.\n\n&gt;\t[Director Tameem] Antoniades said that the permadeath mechanic was a bluff: while the rot will spread on Senua’s body over repeated deaths, it will never fully reach her head; the wording they chose to describe this was meant to convey part of the fear associated with mental illness and psychosis directly to the player. Antoniades said “We were looking for ideas of how you introduce fear, and one of those ideas was the permadeath mechanic. It’s the only time we’re very explicit about what will happen to you in the game.” He considered that they believed that players and critics have mistaken their wording on the permadeath mechanic when the game was released, which created a “blowout”, but he defended their use of the wording as “it’s your interpretation as a player that taints the meaning behind it. That’s something we wanted to do on purpose, because with mental illness it’s your frame of mind that interprets the world, and that can cause you distress.”\n\nWhile I disagree with Antoniades—there’s really not much up for interpretation by stating that “all progress will be lost”— it was a homerun in the sense of getting across the impact they hoped to impose. The game quite literally lied to me and it worked beautifully. I felt like a sucker—I didn’t just play the game, the game played me—but I wouldn’t have had it any other way. \n\nSo I’ll end my wall o’ text there. I searched this subreddit for a similar post and didn’t s’e any other discourse around this mechanic within Hellblade, so I wanted to see what this community felt about it and also discuss if any other games have done a similar “sleight of hand” on its players. \n\nPlease discuss, and thanks for reading!\n\nEdited for clarity. \n\nFinal edit: Turns out Hellblade wasn't lying after all. I just fired up the game to play through the last fight again (assuming it hadn't auto-saved since then). And, well, what would you know... there is no continue point. The rot reached Senua's head in the conclusion and, as they noted, all \"progress\" was gone. There's no save file to continue from. God damn.",

        "text": "It seems like Gone Home had this polarizing love/hate reaction to it, but after finally playing it, I felt like I had a much more mixed response. Am I alone on this? \n\nI enjoyed parts of it, and liked how it gave a different kind of story, but I also was not blown away or felt any major emotional impact. I also didn’t hate its minimal gameplay, as I really enjoy atmospheric story centric games - Ie adventure games.\n\nMaybe it’s because it became too over hyped and a lot of writeups made it clear what the ending was?\n\nI’m mainly a bit confused by it being praised for its innovation - it is a well made game in the vein of adventure games where you explore your environment, but there have been many well made adventure games that have not received this kind of acclaim.\n\nI Have no mouth and I must scream also tackled more serious adult stories and hired Harlan Ellison to write it back in the 90s, for example. \n\nAside from adventure games, it also felt oddly similar to The 7th Guest. Doubt it was intentional, but the layout of the house in both games is incredibly similar. Also gameplay wise, you unlock pieces of a story told in a nonlinear style based on where you go in the House.  When you you finally get access to the house’s attic, The story reaches its climax and resolution. This might be an intentional reference, since Gone Home is set right around when the 7th guest  came out? \n\nTo me, I thought it was very well made given the budget and team size, but it felt more like a proof of concept - Ie ‘hey, this is what we can do with a lot of constraints. We’d like to do something bigger and more ambitious next time’\n\nI read that Gone home initially had more complex gameplay in a sci fi world Interacting with some robots that controlled the game’s house, but they nixed it due to the small size of their team. It seems Tacoma, their current in progress game with a bigger team, perhaps unsurprisingly, is a sci fi game with more complex ways you interact with the story. \n\nSo while clearly gone home was a labor of love for them, it doesn’t seem like it was even intended to be seen as an innovative game of the year, but just essentially a well made small scale first person adventure game with a unique story?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Sounds like a loaded question, but it's not, and I'll explain. There are some games that you can expect to tell a good story when you first learn who's making it and what it is. I personally believe some of those are Soma, Outlast 2, Mass Effect OT, Bioshock and Arkham Asylum (excluding the \"super hero game\" apprehension that was universal before it broke everyone's expectations).\n\nAnd then there are others that are advertised as stories/adventures, but you're cynical from the get-go. I personally believe Mankind Divided, all 3 new Tomb Raiders and Assassins Creed 3+ are examples of these.\n\nDo you think there are any predictors of a game with worthwhile story? By \"worthwhile\" I mean:\n\n1. Fosters empathy with its characters; you legitimately feel what a character is supposed to be feeling\n2. Uses that empathy to explore ideas that, when pondered, can make you wiser about the way life works (an author with perspective that you lack has effectively shared that perspective with you)\n\nSome theories I have right now:\n\n1. The larger the team, the more worthless the story. I think this is because larger teams have to compromise the visions of many people to finish a game. This leads to games like Tomb Raider making huge, glaring narrative conceits for the purposes of setting or gameplay (Lara's \"undercover\" as a cultist priest, but she's the only white person with an English accent in the region).\n\n2. The more expensive the game, the more worthless the story. I think this is because expense creates risk, and studios who can afford expensive games are usually beholden to risk-averse stakeholders (publishers, investors). They feel the need to tell a story that everyone can understand, to ensure that it sells as many copies as possible. Related may be that the story has to accommodate focus-group-favorites gameplay mechanics like an open world and side quests. Lara warmly helping natives with mundane tasks contrasts her anti-social personality, which the game did an otherwise good job of establishing at the start.\n\nI know I called out Tomb Raider both times, above. I'm just in the middle of playing that one, so it's really fresh for me, right now.\n\nWhat do you think? What commonalities have you noticed among games with worthwhile stories and those with worthless (\"less worthwhile\" for the PC-inclined) ones? How do those commonalities affect those stories?",

        "text": "I personally work 40 hour work weeks in engineering and make a decent living. I have a gf and friends and balance these things well. I am also a hardcore Overwatch player as well as hardcore gamer in general. I dedicate a significant amount of my life to gaming. And I have tried all lifestyles prior. I have done my homework and paid my dues and understand the opportunity costs.\n\nMaybe I'm too young to understand this in everyone else's eyes, but why would you get married and have kids as a hardcore gamer? (I understand this question alone may sound ignorant, so bear with the please.\n\nAlmost non-stop for the last 10 years (im 26) I have heard people talk about how they want to play X game but \"I'm married with kids now and I just don't have time to game anymore like I used to.\" Or, \"I really miss those days, etc, etc.\" As just one of many examples, I am on r/classicwow subreddit where people are always posting there asking if they will have time to raid. And tbh, it's just sad, really.\n\nMost people live and die without finding their real passion. If you wake up every morning with the excitement for life brought by gaming late into the night most days, why would you throw all that away for something that clearly was an impulse decision. Discalimer: There are plenty of happy parents out there and even happy gamer parents. I am talking about these people who just have kids because it's what you do and end up with very little time to pursue their passion.\n\nIn other words, if family and kids isn't your number 1, numero uno in life, why oh why would you shoot yourself in the foot and go through with something like that. I get the feeling these people complaining about their lives after kids got suckered into it by their SO who ACTUALLY wanted kids.\n\nI see this everywhere and not just in gaming subreddits. I see it at work. People with kids just have no time for hobbies. Their livea are completely consumed by work and kids. I would say that 25% of these people seem genuinely happy about their situation. And the other 75% seem either outright regretful or apathetic. Many get fat and just let their bodies go.\n\nI understand that being alone takes a strength that few people can really deal with. And for myself I only will date those who are willing to understand these things up front. I need my hardcore gaming hours, my alone time etc. I won't have time for kids, etc. It astonishes me. Because either I am some rare breed and everyone else secretly enjoys having kids and no time to game, or many people are in denial. \n\nWhat i'm hoping to achieve by this thread is for people to call me out and to tell me why I am wrong. I would love to be wrong about this, since my stance that 75% of parents are unhappy seems like an easy stance to refute. But that is my objective assessment. Refute away.",

        "text": "Although mostly applicable to Battlefield games, this kind of logic could apply to other games in the genre. Essentially, the gist of it is to apply a mechanic inspired by the Counter-Strike series and incorporate it into the way in which weapons, equipment, and factions/vehicles are balanced.\n\nThe system would not necessarily need to be a carbon-copy; I don't believe that paying for equipment or weapons on am individual level is a good idea, given the complexity and potential for frustration.\n\nInstead, let me posit a system by which all infantry spawns function in two \"tiers\". Using Battlefield V as an example, it makes for poor gameplay and a negative anesthetic impact for the SVT-40 to be as \"good\" as a Mosin-Nagant (without a scope). Thus, imagine a system in which the match begins, and every soldier has 25 \"credits\". Spawning with a bolt-action rifle or a double barreled shotgun costs no credits. Spawning with an automatic weapon, a pump-action shotgun, a grenade, or some other explosive device costs one credit.\n\nIn doing so, you can assure that most players at any given point are spawning without lots of equipment, but which is still available for pickup from those who died on the field. You can balance grenades and explosives to be much, much stronger. Applying this to vehicles, maybe in conjunction with a limited amount of vehicles available to each team at a time (with spawn times), spawning a vehicle may cost, for example, 5 credits for a tank, 3 for a half track, 2 for a troop transport, and one for a simple truck. And then if you want to spawn in a tank, with a PPSH and a grenade, it is gonna cost 6 credits total. \n\nJoining a match halfway through would prorate the available credits. The whole system would also serve as a form of balance against one-sided quick victories, as if your team is losing heavily, more people will spawn with strong items. \n\nThe point here is not to debate the finer details of how such a thing would be balanced, but only to put it forward as a form of interesting asymmetrical gameplay. The bolt-action rifle loses against the semi-automatic rifle because it's available for free. Maybe there's a way to get credits back by taking objectives or doing certain support roles. The player could be incenticized to act as a team player in order to get access to the fun weaponry. \n\nLet me know what you think.",

        "text": "&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Now, let me start this by saying that obviously luck is a factor in all X-Com games. It is the difference between a shot hitting or not, having a soldier being mind controlled or not. They are, after all, based in board games.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Now, when it comes to XCOM 2, 'luck' is the difference between having a 20 feet tall robot with 40 HP blocks blasting half of your cover and killing two of your soldiers in the same turn, and turning said robot to your side and then killing all the aliens with critical flanking shots.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Robot enemies in XCOM 2 are extremely powerful, from area-based damage attacks, to lots of mobility and armor, and the hacking mechanic is the only defense between you and these foes. So, later on in the game when these enemies comes in packs and you can't kill a Sectopod in a single-turn, shutting down/hacking them becomes your only hope in completing the mission.   \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; So, the end-game, for me, is basically rolling the dice. If I dominate the sectopod I just blow the aliens easily and then have enough time to blast the sectopod itself, if I don't? well, mission failed.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; And since XCOM 2 already have a lot of dice-rolls, from being revealed as a reaper to which enemies you'll activate when stepping in the 'wrong tile', the whole hacking mechanic transforms XCOM 2 into a slots machine on the late game.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Am I missing something or do you guys feel the same? I love the X-Com and it's clones as a whole. I personally think UFO Defense is one of the greatest games of all time and I can't wait for Phoenix Point to hit 1.0. But despite how hard I try, I can't really get into XCOM 2 late game.\n",

I recently preordered Forza Horizon 4 for all the life sim elements and CHOOSING your path to progress, and the fact I’m obsessed with racing games. Although it’s a 6 hour prologue, you can still enjoy many options for your “Horizon Life” 1 hour in. It’s fantastic! I also want to applaud Rockstar for GTA/Red Dead Online and letting us enjoy the dozens of options that let us forge the path we want. Then there are the numerous space sims that take this for granted.\n\nI pretty much sworn off mandatory main campaigns due to all these damn issues including:\n\n1. An “urgent storyline”. Like the world is ending and YOU are the one to stop it... although when the campaign is finished you notice millions have ALREADY saved the world. Main culprits: FFXIV, Dragon Ball Xenoverse\n\n2. Ridiculously difficult bosses and levels that put the game in limbo if you don’t beat it cause “oh the endgame is after this”. Culprits: Pokémon USUM, The Division (which is apparently soloable)\n\n3. If I want to play a game and create my own story, especially if the game is “advertised” for mostly its endgame content, WHY do you make it 20-40 hours into the game. Main Culprits: FFXIV, Diablo 3\n\nI don’t mind a short prologue, introducing you to the world and gameplay. That is it for me tho. As soon as it goes to this “save the world from this bs boss 40 hours in until you can create your own story” I sell it, shelve it and never play it again. And there is SO FEW that let me enjoy many options and let me do it from the start. \n\n/rant\n\nI post stuff like this a lot but damn, I need to let this out. I feel Skyrim kinda made me so bitter towards the more “traditional way” of progression, and it feels so disappointing how much untapped potential there is for this sort of game. Why can’t players let loose like all those space sims? When gameplay like this is excruciatingly rare when this kind of thing is entirely possible shown time and time again with success (Elder Scrolls, Elite Dangerous, BOTW and GTAO come to mind) where are these games? I also want to mention something like this is crucial for a more believable and living world, yet as it stands there’s only a couple of devs working on new games that do this (R*, Bethesda and Amazon (New World) pretty much)\n\n\n\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/9ia8n0/why_the_n64_zelda_games_still_stand_on_top_of/",
        "text": "([Original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda))\n\nThe reasons why the N64 games are still considered solid competitors to even Breath of the Wild seem to be a mystery to most people. I've looked at several opinions as to why Ocarina of Time and/or Majora's Mask are better, but they seem to fall back on the same \"they had story and dungeons\" argument ([Exhibit A](https://screenrant.com/ocarina-of-time-better-than-breath-of-wild-best-legend-game/)).\n\nBut here's my stab at why this is the case: it all boils down to *balance*. The N64 games aren't the best at any one thing, but they're unquestionably the best at doing many things at once. Let's break it down:\n\n**On the overall world:**\n\n* The worlds in both games are filled with things to see and find beyond rupees and Heart Pieces (unlike Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword) without being overly reliant in going out of your way to find required things (unlike Zelda 1, A Link to the Past, and Wind Waker).\n* In both games, you are required to backtrack to earlier areas in order to maximize the potential of each area (unlike Breath of the Wild) without overdoing it to the point of feeling like blatant padding (unlike Phantom Hourglass, Spirit Tracks, and Skyward Sword).\n* Sidequests and other side content are varied with many different ways of completing them and various rewards (unlike Minish Cap and Skyward Sword), but the games weren't overly reliant on them for the meat of content (unlike Breath of the Wild).\n\n**On dungeons:**\n\n* Your time spent in dungeons is evenly divided between combat, navigation, and puzzle solving (most other Zelda games lean towards only one of these aspects, maybe two at most).\n* Dungeons are of a good, meaty length (unlike Breath of the Wild, Wind Waker, and Skyward Sword) without them overstaying their welcome with repetitive setpieces and enemy encounters (unlike Twilight Princess).\n* Exclusively to Ocarina of Time (between the two N64 games), the dungeon order has a clear dungeon order and difficulty progression (unlike Zelda 1 and Breath of the Wild) without tying every facet of its progression to blatant roadblocking and railroading (unlike Twilight Princess, Spirit Tracks, and Skyward Sword).\n\n**On story and characters:**\n\n* Characters are very well-developed (unlike all games pre-Link's Awakening and Breath of the Wild), without shoving the characters in your face every two minutes (unlike Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword).\n* The between-dungeon events have real emotion and substance to them (unlike all pre-Link's Awakening games and Breath of the Wild), but they don't drag on too long and make you want to just hurry to the next dungeon (unlike Twilight Princess, Skyward Sword, and Wind Waker at times).\n\n**On player guidance:**\n\n* Navi and Tatl are fantastic companions that only forcibly interrupt you for things that are hard to notice such as Wallmaster rooms (unlike in Skyward Sword), and their guidance allows you to complete the games without looking up a guide (unlike Zelda 1, Zelda 2, and A Link to the Past at times).\n* NPCs outside of your main helper do a good job at telling you where to go (unlike Zelda 1, Zelda 2, and A Link to the Past) without resorting to making them event flags (unlike Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword). Useful NPCs also tend to be on the main path in some fashion (unlike Breath of the Wild).\n\nThat's likely just a smattering of reasons as to why the N64 games are just so *balanced*. Again, they didn't aim to be the best in exploration, puzzle solving, combat, or story; they instead aimed to do all of those aspects and more well above average.\n\nOf course, even though the N64 games are balanced in virtually every aspect, they aren't the best in every way. The combat of the N64 games is incredibly crude, and the graphics and character models are dated (and the 3DS remakes didn't fix the last part as much as I would have liked).\n\nEven still, the N64 Zelda games, with their balance, felt like they offered something for everyone. Explorative freedom and focused storytelling; puzzles and navigation; guidance without handholding: they had it all. I've always felt that Zelda's central theme was the balance of Power, Wisdom, and Courage, and the N64 games embodied that ideal by balancing every central aspect of the series.",

        "text": "The past few days, I have been reading dozens of articles and comments about PvZ2, Peggle and Peggle Blast, the Bejeweled series, Bookworm, EA and PopCap. I have also started playing Peggle Blast and Bejeweled Stars on my iPad recently. The things I've noticed got me worried and angry. I only realized yesterday that the original Peggle games got removed from the App Store. I've investigated online and found some crazy posts from @PopCap Games on Twitter... Removing the original Plants vs. Zombies HD from the App Store and another shocking thing I read a lot about is the layoffs that happened in Summer 2017 in PopCap, Seattle. I knew before that PopCap had had layoffs but I didn't realize that it has happened TWICE! This got me thinking... \nWill PopCap face a shutdown like many other companies that were bought by EA. My long time away of video gamimg made me miss so much... I was optimistic about the future of PvZ and PopCap but after reading all the comments and the articles about this, I really was pissed and sad. So seeing the App Store didn't have any of the old casual PopCap classics like Peggle, Zuma, Bookworm, the original AD-free PvZ1 amd many more and after trying myself to play the new Peggle and Bejeweled that were released in 2014 and 2016 respectively, I have some things to say about this situation. Those 2 new Peggle and Bejeweled games didn't really feel like the old casual fun. Those games are free to play and I'm not against this model sine I've already stated in previous posts and comments that I've said before, I just focus on playing but the reason I enjoyed the original Peggel and Bejeweled was just for 3 words: FUN. RELAXING. CASUAL. But those newly released titles are more stressful and don't sadly have the old PopCap charm... Not only that but you can also see the lack of the creativity that was present in the pre-EA PopCap. PopCap ended the support for many of their beloved games, they stopped releasing PC games which is awful too. As for the Garden Warfare series, I can't judge since I haven't played these titles but I've read that PopCap introduced in-app purchases to them which is bad. I hope you guys understand what I'm saying.\n\nSo I've began to think about PvZ2 too. The latest PopCap, Seattle layoffs happened in Summer 2017 right? Well after reading so much posts about the Plant Leveling System and the newly released PvP Battlez (which I've not played yet and which turned to be nothing but a scammy game mode full of bots) and posts about the REAL REASON why A LOT of features got removed from the game, I must say a lot of the comments that I’ve read actually made sense. All of those modes were and still are excuses to make money... I’ve been reading a lot about this, trust me. I’ve learned that EA was voted the “Worst Company In America” for 2 years in a row... In PvZ2, lots and lots of features were removed in favor to add the paid stuff like Piñatas, more premium plants... I’ve been digging in the data and have learned that they planned to remove gem drops, coin drops, coin rewards and many things too. They also had a sneaky dynamic difficulty system that made the game harder as you win more and more. They removed the best music in the game. They gave us 10 world keys straight, I was okay with it until I thought that this really kills the sense of progression of the game. They also made costumes purchasable instead of just earning them in Piñata Parties... EA just wants to implement features that will generate money. I was so stupid to think otherwise before. The Plant Leveling System is nice but it’s just an excuse to provide Piñatas (aka Loot Boxes) that cost tons of money. I’ve watched so many videos about more horrible stuff EA did to their games and companies. Please, trust me on this! It’s the truth. I've been thinking a lot in the fast few days about all of what happened to PvZ2 and PopCap and I've realized that the future of PvZ doesn't look so bright to me anymore... It's completely true the PvZ2 and PvZ Heroes are still fun to play and I really do enjoy playing them. But I won't anymore play them. Because I've read a lot of stuff about EA and I just can't trust them anymore. PopCap's future is not bright at all... EA has done horrible things and I just can't forgive them anymore...\n\nAfter all what I’ve read about EA and the research I’ve done on the matter I regret posting about how we can ignore in-app purchases and how the PopCap/EA games can be fully enjoyed and played. It’s not true... That’s why I deleted my post about how PvZ’s future looks bright. It doesn’t actually. \n\nConclusion: EA IS RUINING THE GAMING INDUSTRY. PERIOD.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nI'll be adding more comments and thoughts about this.\nPlease, I would like your opinion about this. This is a big case we're talking about. If you agree say why and you disagree and hate me for saying this please say why.\n\nP.S. Opening Peggle on my PC now. See ya!",

        "text": "So a me and friend were having this discussion just the other day, and I realised how difficult it was (for my shitty brain at least) to come up with the best individual \"moments\" in our favourite games. I'm curious to know what you think the best moments are.\n\nI've managed to come up with a few of my favourites, but I'm sure there is many, many more I can't think of right now. *SPOILERS* Obviously.\n\n\n\n\n* Super Metroid - Using a power bomb to blow up the glass tube that allows you to enter the sea of Maridia. I remember going back and fourth for a good while before I had that \"eurica!\" Moment. It was the moment that made me realise the game I'm playing is going to be one of my all time favourites. \n\n\n\n\n* Chrono Trigger - When Lavos causes the disaster that wipes out the dinosaurs, and ends the stone age. I mean... an asteroid crashes into the planet, and the moment ends with you flying away on fucking Pterodactyls to avoid the chaos below. And it proceeds an epic boss fight with a T-Rex that comes just before. \n\n\n\n\n* Bioshock - Would you kindly. It's the moment that puts the whole game into perspective. Everything just clicks, and you instantly go \"Ohhhh it all makes sense... Wait what the fuck!?\" You feel actual betrayal. Best twist ever?\n\n\n\n\n* Dragon Age: Inquisition - Fighting the first optional dragon in the desert region. Now I  know this game isn't well loved, but it has my favourite dragon battles in any game, and the first is obviously the one that leaves the most impact. The dragon battles take actual thought and strategy, you'll use everything at your disposal to take down one of the bad boys. I felt like I actually went through a fight after conquering my first dragon.\n\n\n\n\n* Metal Gear Solid 3 - the Big Boss torture scene. Boss getting beat up brutally by Colonel Volgin, Ocolot gun juggling, tense moment that leads to boss getting his eye shot out showing us how he got the famous eye patch, fun cheesy dialogue, what's not to love? Probably my favourite cut scene of all time.\n\n\n\n",

RDR2 has I think mechanics of your gang and their interactions which will probably be cool to see over time but I still feel like that's not an innovation so much as a modification. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?

Oblivion does occasionally offer player choice, and one instance of this is one of the most creative instances of player choice I've seen in a game. \n\nHalf way through the Main Quest, Sean Bean asks you to retrieve and sacrifice a daedric artifact. You are pointed to Azuras star, but any will do. These are highly unique items. Not just abnormally high statistical buffs, but items that change how you play. Depending on your playstyle some will be more useful than others, but giving one up is quite a dilemma. But none of this affects the story in the slightest, it's a gameplay dilemma, and an interesting one, and I wish this was more common in these types of things. ",

        "text": "In [this thread in r/games](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/9h52ib/jump_force_adds_killua_and_kurapika_from_hunter_x/), the new model for Killua, a child character in the anime is revealed to be a playable character on the developer's Twitter. \n\nI work in the game industry, so this might be something I'm more sensitive to than your average gamer, but I was immediately struck by how strange the Killua character looked, but when I posted about it to the thread, many of the responses were that they thought the character looked find. So I'm wondering how much morphology distortion is tolerable to gamers and if there are factors that cause it to be more tolerable in some games than in others.\n\nSo here are a few questions:\n\n1. If you are familiar with the character Killua, does [this image](https://twitter.com/YonkouProd/status/1042392409290620928), pass as okay? \n2. (Please don't read or answer this until answering the question above to get your initial impression) Did you notice that Killua's shoulders, torso, and hips are as wide as the older teenage character he is next to (Kurapika)? Did you notice that his head is as large as Kurapika's? Now that I've pointed it out, does it bother you?\n3. Does it still pass as okay if you look at a [pic from the anime](http://pre10.deviantart.net/b855/th/pre/i/2012/067/b/d/gon__kurapika_and_killua___assembly_by_itachigraydluffy-d4s3xy7.png) that has both Killua and Kurapika in it?\n4. Do you think you are more tolerant of some distortion in a character's morphology for some genres than others?\n5. How about settings? Is it okay because this is an anime setting, but it wouldn't work if this was a more realistic setting?\n6. Can you think of any other games that have had characters that had strange morphology that caused you to have to struggle to suspend your disbelief? For example, did you find the child characters in The Witcher 3 to be strangely dwarfish and cherubic - like the artist started on dwarf children and got switched to another project so that they were never able to work on human children?\n7. Finally, is this more tolerable in characters that aren't focused on often? For example, the kids in The Witcher 3 are not often part of the story and are usually just munchkins you ride past in villages, so despite the fact that they looked odd to me, they were so rarely around that it wasn't that big a deal (to me). However, if Atreus did not look like a real human child (well a magical god one), it would probably have really hurt the God of War experience (again, IMO).\n\nEdit: Btw, I am not criticizing this game at all. It is just a good example for talking about this subject.\n",

        "text": "So, what do I mean with the title? For some time now I've been considering for a hypothetical resolution of our gaming collection. I believe that in this digital age of video games almost everyone has at least some games (if not all of them) through some kind of program. Be it Steam, Origin, Uplay, Battle-net or other such product, we all have our games through them. Now through time I've gathered quite a collection of games on each of the aforementioned programs, but I can't help myself then to feel fear for them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I mean by fear is that I'm actually wondering how long are they going to last. We've seen the shut down of couple of popular programs that are used for gaming. For example Gamespy. Gamespy may not have been a program for games in a particular way of having a library of them, but it served a serious part for games. Of course I know that the money will always keep those platforms on, but maybe in the future we witness something that will take over and leave everything we have to dust. I believe that all of the fear I have for the collection of games I've accumulated is coming from the attachment to them. I don't want it to sound weird, because it's just a feel that you have when you collect something for years and you don't want it to go away, but you know that at the end you have no power to keep it if something goes awry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNothing lasts forever, not even the platforms (even though I hope). What I'm getting with all of this is I really would like to hear what people think about this as I've never seen someone talk about this topic. ",

        "text": "I've recently tried games like Destiny 2, World of Warcraft, Guild Wars 2 and others, and in just about all of them a significant chunk of your progression is tied to some form of daily, weekly (or somewhere in between) tasks/bonuses that are chosen by the game.\n\nI'm not sure if inorganic is the right word, but the worlds you actually play in seem like nothing other than an elaborate interface for facilitating these tasks where you, and other players read what the arbitrary task of the day or week is, hop in to that area, do the task and get out.\n\nBack in the day I can remember playing a game like World of Warcraft and seeing players group up for an elite mob, so I'd join them. We'd go back to the quest NPC but the enemy faction might have taken it over, so we'd start to PvP to get it back. These specifics tasks weren't so much of what made playing the game fun, it was the adventure along with doing them, the unexpected things that might happen. You would just get immersed and lost in the world doing whatever you wanted to and it all happened organically or naturally.\n\nNowadays to group up with players you have to scan your map for the world quest you need, join up with the group finder, get put in their instance, you kill the boss and then everyone disperses in an instance. If you want PvP you have to go queue up for an expedition or something like that. There is never any journey it's just taking you straight to the destination and it's exactly what you expect will happen every single time.\n\nI just find it kind of sad because getting lost in these adventures, being immersed in the world, meeting and actually interacting with other players was what I enjoyed most about those games, and it's completely discouraged from a progression stand point.\n\nJust as bad is how these sorts of things gate your progression, even for casual players. Could you imaging if you played Skyrim and the game limited you to a daily dragon soul per day and randomly chosen which dragon it was that gave you the soul? Want another you'll have to log in tomorrow. Don't log in for 5 days, well you just missed out on them, we won't even let you accumulate them if you're offline, you have to play the game exactly how we want you to. Okay that might be extreme but they've added these mechanics under the guise of being a 'boost' for casual players, but they're actually just ways to slow down your progression and manipulate you into logging in regularly. But even as a casual player if you haven't logged into WoW for a few days or a week, you don't accumulate the bonuses, instead you just feel like you missed out on a bunch of them and you have no more to do than if you were playing regularly. You never feel like you can make the most of your time and catch up on things you missed out on. They've just expired and they end up making aspects of the game feel like a chore more than anything else. If they're truly bonuses why shouldnt' you be able to save them how you wish, for example WoW gives a bonus to the first arena, BG or Epic BG of day, or 3 new Emissary quests every 3 days. But you can't save them all for say a night a friend you PvP with is on and burn through them, no they're only there to nag at you and get them done each day.\n\nThese days I'm finding that the story, visuals, sounds and atmosphere of these games are better than they've ever been, but what you actually go about doing in a typical sit down session of say 30 or 60 minutes is in the worst state it's ever been in, and I hardly have any desire to keep picking these kinds of games up. In fact I honestly can't see myself ever buying another one of these games that gives you checklists of tasks that reset on some regular basis to do for rewards/bonuses...I'm just fed up with them.",

        "text": "Hey. I've been gaming ever since I was 5 years old. Mostly just singleplayer stuff, but all kinds of games. Action games, adventure, racing, strategy, simulation, everything. I wasn't really into the online gaming scene, it was just frantic madness to me. I preferred playing relaxing singleplayer games.\n\nAfter turning 17, I got a little less interested in gaming. I went from being a hardcore gamer to a casual gamer. I only gamed for less than an hour every day. And on holidays, I'd game for maybe 2 hours in a day. \n\nBut I still enjoyed games. I loved games like Minecraft, Skyrim, Splinter Cell (Major fan of this) COD, Max Payne, etc.\n\nI bought Siege last year to try out the singleplayer because I liked tactical shooter games. After finishing the singleplayer missions, I thought '' ehh why not just try the multiplayer to see what it's like ''.......AND MY FUCKING MIND WAS BLOWN! I felt like how Squidward felt when he ate his first crabby patty. '' ALL THE WASTED YEARS!!! '' \n\nEver since I started playing Siege online, that's all that I've been playing. Nothing else! I cannot enjoy anything else anymore! If I turn on a singleplayer game now, I get excruciatingly bored because I'm like '' What' the point in playing this. Everything is scripted, and I'm just playing out an interactive movie. '' \n\nSingleplayer gaming does not have any spontaneity. That's only there in online gaming, because you're playing with actual people and you have to get into their mind and what they might be thinking. There's so much improvisation in online gameplay, that opens up so many different possibilities to how a game can turn out. None of that magic exists in singleplayer games. You're just fighting against AI. There's no unknown. Everything is dead and controlled. \n\nI am not even kidding when I'm saying this. This is a problem because I can't enjoy other games anymore. Sometimes I get bored of Siege and then I retort to playing Battlefront online or Battlefield online. But that's it. Online gaming has RUINED singleplayer gaming for me! The only other type of game I mildly enjoy now are creative sandbox games like Subnautica and simulation games like Flight Simulator.....because they don't have a scripted narrative, you decide how the game goes. \n\nWHAT DO I DO!? Even if there's a singeplayer game out there that has amazing graphics, amazing mechanics, I still cannot play it just knowing that everything is scripted. ",

        "text": "First a disclaimer: I am happy that 'easy' difficulties exist. I once learned that people with only one hand or people who are almost blind play games too, and I am happy there are settings that help to normalise the difficulty for them. Now to the subject:\n\nSometimes RPG choises are tough: Which of your two friends do you save? Sometimes I would argue they are less so. If a game is not difficult enough, when an npc tempts the player with more power, but the game is not rewarding power, that temptation is meaningless and devolves into 'Wanna be a meanie this time?'\n\nMany times power cam be desired for having the power to do more good. Sometimes it is desired so that you can survive and not perish. Often, the choise in games is 'Do you want to roleplay a power hungry selfish person?' because the games are so easy that more power changes nothing. However, if you HAD learned the dark arts from a dark pact made, and you are confronted with 'which of your friends do you save?', perhaps you ARE powerful enough to save them both, introducing more nuance, greyness and consequences for choises.\n\nAnother example could be accepting bribes from a murderer who wants to escape. Perhaps later you could use that money to help farm folks who have lost it all, instead of money being so plentiful in a game that you can make them all barons anyway if you want.\n\nMore difficult games result in deeper and more impactful games.",

        "text": "With the new Animal Crossing for Switch announcement and Isabelle in Smash Bros, I realized I have no idea why people like the series, or even other games of the genre.\n\nI've tried playing it myself, put a couple of months casual play on the Gamecube when it first came out and tried Stardew Valley when it released on Switch, but my impressions were fiercely negative. I feel like I'm not getting the core of the enjoyment loop. I'm a strategy game fan -- the most important thing for my enjoyment of a video game is meaningful decisions, being punished for not being smart or quick enough. I skip quest text in MMO's. I like greifing other players in PvP. I know pretty clearly why I dislike the game, but can't find why people _like_ the gameplay.\n\nI took to Youtube and the wider internet to see if anyone could describe the appeal to me, and I particularly liked [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFRs_tBT75c) from a small Youtuber, which echoed something someone told me in Discord: It's a glimpse of peace, or stress-free release.\n\nI like to relax too, though, but these games never seemed like that to me. I don't find picking weeds relaxing. I find it pointless. I could do a laundry list of menial tasks with no repercussions... or I could go play a tactics game with a challenge and decisions to make.\n\nI enjoy the art design and aesthetic. I enjoy the music and personality of the games. I recognize they're well-made games, with events to do and a lot of love in them. I just don't get why they're fun or why they sell _so_ much more than things that I feel are infinitely more enjoyable video games.\n\nAlso, why are the games more popular among women? According to Iwata, [while 69% of 3DS owners were male, 56% of Animal Crossing: New Leaf owners were female.](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZZO50298050V00C13A1000000/?df=2) Surely men like to relax as well?\n\n",

Nintendo &amp; Microsoft allowing developers to enable cross-play between any devices bring friends together &amp; enable developers to consolidate their player base into one large pool.\n\nSony should not stop developers from integrating cross-play. Great example was with fornite where cross-play between PS4 &amp; Xbox was enabled, but when it was noticed by Sony, they quickly forced Epic to block it. Sony is even locking Epic account into PS4 &amp; PC so that they can't be used on other consoles. Rocket League developers voiced their stance for support of Cross-play &amp; Minecraft Bedrock edition is being denied release on PS4 because of required cross-play.\n\nCross-play benefits all gamers &amp; to those who have friends with different consoles. Sony should work to bring friends together, not separate them by building a wall between devices. This artificial anti-consumer practice must end this generation &amp; let developers choose what is best for their game &amp; their community, not Sony.",

        "text": "Hey All. Back with a question concerning game development. I’m getting closer to finishing a game design document for an interactive turn based RPG that I’m looking to submit to some indie game publishing companies. While I know for a fact I’d like to make the game for Mac and Windows (and possibly Linux) I’m also wondering if it would be reasonable to design the game for handheld consoles as well, specifically the PlayStation Vita.\n\nI personally think that the Vita is a fantastic console, despite losing support from Sony, and I’m glad that developers are still working on games for the platform. However, I’m worried that by the time I’d be finished making my game in about 2-3 years or so, Vita support would be all but gone. I know that everyone is all out and about saying that Switch is the future of handhelds, but given their current practices in regards to their digital market, I’m personally a bit skeptical about the Switch’s future.\n\nSo if that’s the case, should I steer my development goals away from Handhelds and focus solely on PC development? And possibly Home Consoles like “XBox 2” and “PS5” as a stretch goal? Any thoughts you guys have on this would be most appreciated.\n\nOn a side note, there are a few other factors that I’d really appreciate some input from you guys on as well. I’m currently thinking of either making the game on RPG Maker MV or Unity, but not sure which would allow for Handheld portability, or if a whole other engine would be more ideal doe something like that. Also, I’m wondering which indie publishers I could pitch my game concept to, or if any of them turn me down, where I could look for team members to make the game with me. What do you guys think about any of these?",

        "text": "**Introduction**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a personal opinion, feel free to read and discuss.\n\nHaving played [PUBG](https://sanhok.playbattlegrounds.com/) on Xbox and PC to the point of being addicted and having to quit, I have acquired a good knowledge of the game and as of now (16th September 2018) , I have seen [Black Ops 4 Battle Royal Beta](https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/blackops4) being played by streamers such as [Ninja](https://www.twitch.tv/ninja),[Dr.Disrespect](https://www.twitch.tv/drdisrespectlive) and [Shroud](https://www.twitch.tv/shroud). I think there is a discussion needed in terms of what games will be able to compete once Black Ops 4 is fully released on [12th October 2018.](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=black+ops+4+realease+date&amp;oq=black+ops+4+realease+date&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2831j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)\n\n**PUBG v Black Ops 4**\n\nBlack Ops 4 has a feel to it that is not felt in PUBG,which itself has had a history of problems with FPS quality, glitches,hackers, lack of updates,lack of a progression system and many more... Now I am sure Black Ops 4 will on it's own have problems once the game is released but it feels like the Beta has addressed many issues which have plagued PUBG. The game looks smoother ,better paced and much more developed already then PUBG. Rumours of a league system, similar to its previous titles promises to address the lack of a progressive system in PUBG which is average and controversial at best having pushed their micro-transaction system on players too eagerly before developing the game to the potential it first promised. You can only hope this progression system will be similar to that of ranking systems in [Rainbow Six](http://rainbowsix.wikia.com/wiki/Ranked) or [ Rocket League](http://rocketleague.wikia.com/wiki/Competitive). Being able to test yourself against 99 other players of similar ability will be refreshing.\n\n**Nostalgia and Call of Duty**\n\nBeing a big fan of Call of Duty 4 and seeing the game gradually decline has been a painful and heartbreaking experience ,however this next title is bringing back certain smaller maps and guns to incorporate them into Battle Royal Mode, with maps such as [Firing Range](http://callofduty.wikia.com/wiki/Firing_Range?file=Bare_Load_Screen_Firing_Range_BO.jpg) being included in the potentially first [Battle Royal Map](https://goo.gl/images/3kJav9). This will undoubtedly attract many former Call of Duty Franchise fans to experience the new level of gaming which Black Ops 4 will be trying to achieve.\n\n**Battlefield 5 and Fortnite**\n\nEA DICE released a Beta for [Battlefield 5](https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield/battlefield-5/buy) at around the same time as Black Ops 4 but having failed to include a Battle Royal Mode,which has been confirmed to be coming with the full released means the creators and publishers of Black Ops 4 (Treyarch and Activision) essentially beat EA DICE to the punch. They have applied pressure to EA DICE with the quality that is on show in their Beta Royal Mode. We are yet to see what Battlefield 5 will offer us in terms of their Royal Mode and whether the title itself will emulate its most popular predecessor [Battlefield 4](https://www.battlefield.com/en-gb/games/battlefield-4) or even its most recent release [Battlefield 1](https://www.battlefield.com/en-gb/games/battlefield-1). [Fortnite](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/buy-now/battle-royale) being the only legit competitor which could be dethroned as a current top Battle Royal game. The younger player base which Fornite tempted away from the Call of Duty franchise will no doubt be watching Ninja play Black Ops 4 Beta on Twitch .I cannot predict their opinions or know their actions but I know they will consider this new game as an alternative. In the same way as current PUBG fans will consider Black Ops 4 Battle Royal Mode an alternative to PUBG having seen Dr.Disrespect and Shroud play the Beta on their respective streams.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nEven though I wont be buying the game for personal reasons ,the game has a lot of potential to be the next big title in the gaming world. It is easy to foresee it topping Steam Charts ,as well as most played game on Xbox One and Playstation 4 networks. It's influence spreading onto [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/directory) as the most watched game and the most competed over in terms of E-Sports for months and years to come.",
