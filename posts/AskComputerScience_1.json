        "text": "Hello r/AskComputerScience (Please remove this post if it is not allowed)\n\nI am a student at the University of Glasgow and I am currently recruiting participants to evaluate the tool I developed for my honours project. The tool is called JSONTalk and it is a summarising tool for JSON files.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of JSONTalk in helping individuals understand and analyse JSON files. The study should take around 15 minutes and participants will be asked to answer a series of questions based on 3 different screenreader transcripts of JSON files.\n\nParticipants will be randomly divided into two groups. One group will be given the opportunity to download and use JSONTalk to help them answer the questions, while the other group will be answering the questions without the tool. Everyone clicks the same link, and the allocation will happen automatically.\n\nYou do not need to have much JSON knowledge to participate, however, some programming background is required. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at [**2463548h@student.gla.ac.uk**](mailto:2463548h@student.gla.ac.uk). \n\nYour participation in this study would be greatly appreciated and would contribute to the development of this tool.\n\nLink to complete study:  https://uofg.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_5u0X9Ehoan0WNng",

        "text": "I feel like this kind of format would have made a lot of sense for professional use in the early era of digital photography, where all existing media (floppies, initial attempts at NAND flash, etc) were either too slow or too expensive per byte.\n\nPresumably, such a format would have required you to transfer the data off of it within a day of taking the photos, so as to not run out of power and lose the photos — but most digital photographers transfer their photos to a PC as soon as they're done the shoot, so that would have worked out. (And hopefully, it would have been continuously powered at both ends, only really requiring the battery in between.)\n\nThis also could have been a way to introduce \"memory cards\" for game consoles as far back as the Super Nintendo era — game cartridges of that era already came with battery-backed \"save memory\"; in theory that setup (RAM + battery) could have been lifted out and placed into its own separate shell. The save data in old cartridge games seems to keep for years — sometimes decades — so why didn't we see this?\n\nThe closest thing I can find is [the Gigabyte i-RAM](https://www.anandtech.com/show/1742) — but that's an internal storage device, a literal \"RAM drive\" for a PC, not an external portable storage/data-transfer format.",

Obviously the reason why binary is used is due to the natural binary state of both electrical current and a metal medium such as a hard disk. If however we wanted to apply hexadecimal to fiber connections, would that be worth doing? If we set up a fiber line with 15 colors (not including \"off\") could we have a fiber connection  that was 4 times as efficient at transferring data? \n\nFeel free to answer this with opinion or personal experience. I'm not looking for a specific answer just wanting to have discussion and get a better understanding. Thanks!",

Without modded minecraft running (just using it as an example cuz I think it's the single most taxing thing I use ram for at any point in time), my computer is using roughly 40% of the ram while idling (\\~90% with modded mc running). Overall though multitasking is becoming increasingly slower, and while I'm generally good with minimizing the number of programs/tabs I have open on my computer at a time, I still have my fair share of open things as I tend to actually use them and jump around a lot now and then. I've tried diagnosing other potential issues with my PC slowing, but there didn't seem to be anything wrong, so now I'm left wondering if it's worth upgrading my RAM and by how much, and if this is my best avenue, I might need help finding out which RAM I should look into getting.",

As more of these images are posted online, what's to keep them from seeping into training datasets? Is there some hard stop that developers use, say, \"Our training dataset features \\*only\\* images from before 2020 and the widespread availability of AI image generation engines.\" Otherwise, wouldn't there be a sort of feedback loop, eventually leading to AI image generators of lower quality as they are trained on AI-generated images?\n\nN.B.

        "text": "__Introduction__:   \n   \nThe Triangular Decision Cycle Framework Diagram is a visual tool used to track the flow of data within decision cycles. It was originally developed as a theoretical framework. The TDCF builds upon the Decision Cycle Framework (DCF) by providing a visual diagram that tracks the flow of data in decision cycles. The DCF is based on the DTM, a framework that classifies data sources into three types: spatial, time-series, and information/hypothesis, and allows for nine possible combinations of these sources to be used in decision cycles.\n   \n__Data Sources__ (DS):   \n   \nRational Agents deal with different types of data sources: observations/actions in space (S), series of observations/actions over time (T), and information/hypothesis available to an observer (I). AIXI is an example of a rational agent. Spatial data, time series data, and information can all be represented as sequences, which can potentially match each other.\n   \n__Data Transfer Methods__ (DTM):   \n   \nThe data sources can be combined in nine different ways designated as \"Input→Output (Name)\" . For example:   \nS→S (Duplicate) - Photographing an object   \nS→T (Playback) - Playing a song from sheet music   \nT→S (Record) - Recording a song onto a record   \nT→T (Repeat) - Repeating an experiment   \nI→T (Explain) - Explaining a theory verbally   \nI→S (Depict) - Depicting a theory in a graph or writing it down   \nT→I (Build, Agile) - Building a project based on a theory heard in a meeting   \nS→I (Build, Waterfall) - Building a project based on a theory read in a document   \nI→I (Model) - Modeling a hypothesis, such as weather simulation.   \n   \nEach data transfer method has an associated ratio that measures the size of the input relative to the size of the output. These ratios are necessary for measuring different objects that perform DTMs. For example:   \nS→S (Duplicate): (input meters/output meters); scale - dimensionless   \nT→T (Repeat): (input seconds/output seconds); speedup - dimensionless   \nI→I (Model): (input bits/output bits); lossy compression - dimensionless   \nT→S (Record), S→T (Playback): (input meters/output seconds); velocity and inverse   \nT→I (Build, Agile), I→T (Explain): (input bits/output seconds); bandwidth and inverse   \nI→S (Depict), S→I (Build, Waterfall): (input bits/output meters); data density and inverse   \n   \n__Decision Cycle Framework__ (DCF):   \n   \nThe framework outlines a decision-making cycle that includes the following stages:   \nData Collection: Duplicating (S→S) or recording (T→S) data.   \nHypothesis Generation: Creating a theory based on the data, generating possible depictions (I→S) - AIXI brute forces this. A literature review can be included that listens or reads about prior theories (T→I) and (S→I).   \nTesting, Simulation, and Planning: Testing, simulating, and planning based on the hypothesis by creating a model (I→I) then recording data (T→S) (data recorded from the simulation).   \nCommunication: (optional) Verbally explaining the hypothesis to others (I→T).   \nImplementation: Playing back the simulation (S→T).   \nIteration: Repeating the entire cycle as needed by repeating the experiment (T→T).   \n   \n__Triangular Decision Cycle Framework__ (TDCF):   \n   \nThe TDCF is a graphical representation of the DCF that helps to visualize the stages of the decision cycle and their interconnections.   \nAssign {S, T, I} to the vertices of an equilateral triangle. For each DTM, let its coordinate be Input + Output. Now connect the DTMs at each stage, and connect the stages using arrows. There is now a triangle that visually depicts a decision cycle as a loop. This creates an equilateral triangle with the dimensionless DTMs at the vertices and the dimensional DTMs in between.",

        "text": "*I hope this is the right subreddit for this kind of post, if not, please point me to the right place.*\n\nI can assure you this is not a coding question, it is purely algorithmic, but I will start with describing the code/project that my question stems from.\n\n## Context\n\nI have been working on a Minesweeper bot/solver project for a while, [here's the GitHub if you're curious](https://github.com/GeorgeD88/Minesweeper-Solver). I've gotten to a point where I want my bot to recognize certain patterns of tiles in a grid. After a quick convo with ChatGPT, it seemed apparent that subgraph isomorphism was exactly what I needed. The thing is, subgraph isomorphism is pretty advanced to the point where there aren't easy to understand YouTube videos or articles for it, like there are for topics such as the disjoint-set structure and minimum spanning trees.\n\nI've been only able to find research papers and textbooks discussing it. Now, I was ready to take on this task and start reading away, but I realized I should ask others first about what's the best way to approach this, as that'll ensure I'm doing this efficiently and not making this harder on myself. At the same time, I may be wrong about subgraph isomorphism being what I need, so I would also like suggestions on what is the best algorithm for my needs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## Algorithm\n\nHere's exactly what I'm trying to do. I have a grid graph, represented as a 2D array so that you can access it like coordinates, `grid[row][col]`. I have multiple patterns such as, a tile marked 2 directly adjacent to a tile marked 1, but the orientation can be whichever way: 1 below 2, 2 below 1, 2 to the right of 2, etc. I want to be able to scan my grid/board and identify all the places the patterns appear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## Questions Summarized\n\nNow that you fully understand what I'm trying to achieve, here are the main questions/asks:\n\n\\- Please suggest the easiest yet best resources to learn Ullmann's subgraph isomorphism algorithm for a complete beginner to this concept, then suggest the best \"regular level\" resources.\n\n\\- Is subgraph isomorphism what I need to achieve what I'm looking for? if so, is Ullmann's the best subgraph isomorphism algorithm for the job? *keep in mind I'm working on a (somewhat large) grid graph, and searching for multiple very small target subgraphs/patterns (up to 5 nodes).*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you have any critiques about my post, please let me know. Thank you very much in advance :)",

        "text": "Basically the title. I noticed that I was confused when looking up some chip specs and was hoping that someone could explain where my misunderstandings are coming from. \n\nIn DRAM your have one capacitor and 1 transistor per bit so 2B transistors would give about 256MB of DRAM. So if your computer has 64 GB of DRAM, it's got about 512B transistors dedicated to DRAM. On NewEgg, this runs you about $200 CAD. Around $0.40 per billion transistors\n\nIn contrast, the M2 has 20B transistors (on a smaller production node) and about an eighth (?) of the die is dedicated to cache (lets say 2-3B transistors). SRAM (what cache uses) normally uses 6 transistors per bit, so 2-3B transistors should give about 40-60MB of cache. And that's about what you see. 16 MB L2, 8 MB last level, ~ 300 KB L1 per core which matches nicely with the estimated 40-60MB minus caching circuitry.\n\nThe price difference between a M2 Pro (40B transistors) and M2 Max (67B transistors) is somewhere around $500-800 CAD on otherwise similar models, so somewhere around $20 per billion transistors.\n\nSo basically, why do CPUs cost almost two orders of magnitude more relative to DRAM? The die sizes have to be a lot larger as well size DRAM usually uses older 10-15nm nodes(?)\n\n\n\nI was under the impression that the manufacturing cost associated with a chip (assuming low fault rates) was just proportional to the size of the die.",

Now, I am considering switching to another field, probably computer science. I started studying computer science on my own a few weeks ago and I like it. Furthermore, I am a logical and reflective person, so I think I could be good at it. The only thing that concerns me is that I am already 21 and have just started learning about computer science. I see children starting to code at a very young age and who already have a much better level than me. I am a very ambitious person and I want to excel in what I do, but when I think that many have years and years of experience ahead of me, I think it is realistically impossible. Please answer honestly, objectively and bluntly if necessary, is it too late for me to start in computer science and programming?",

As the number of markers grows, this doesn't seem scalable.  \n\n\nProxying traffic on the Airbnb website, I see that it makes calls to [maps.googleapis.com](https://maps.googleapis.com) as the user moves the map. This seems to be returning new markers for the client to display. So in this scenario, Google actually has the marker data for the map used by AirBnb.  \n\n\nLooking through the Google Cloud console, under maps platform, the only things I see when you create a map are to style how it looks. So fundamentally I don't see a way to do what AirBnb is doing.  \n\n\nAm I missing something?",

        "text": "I have had trouble finding information about several concepts/definitions relating to formal language theory, so it would be greatly appreciated if someone could explain these definitions I came across in the textbook I'm reading. I am not sure where to post this, so if there is a better subreddit for this question, I would appreciate it if someone let me know and I'll post this there instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor some context, here's a passage from the textbook where the author lists the grammar symbols used in this section:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; In this chapter, we use a small set of notational conventions for grammar  \nsymbols and strings to make the discussion less cluttered. For formal  \nlanguages, they are as follows:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;1. **Terminal symbols**—lowercase letters at the beginning of the alphabet (a,  \nb, . . .)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n2. **Nonterminal symbols**—uppercase letters at the beginning of the  \nalphabet (A, B, . . .)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n3. **Terminals or nonterminals**—uppercase letters at the end of the alphabet  \n(W, X, Y, Z)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n4. **Strings of terminals**—lowercase letters at the end of the alphabet (w, x,  \ny, z)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n5. **Mixed strings (terminals and/or nonterminals)**—lowercase Greek letters  \n(α, β, δ, γ) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith this notation in mind, I am having trouble understanding three seemingly related terms:\n\n1. **Handle**\n2. **Phrase**\n3. **Simple Phrase**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is a passage from the textbook where each of these terms is defined:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The handle of a right sentential form is unique. The task of a bottom-up  \nparser is to find the handle of any given right sentential form that can be  \ngenerated by its associated grammar. Formally, handle is defined as follows:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nDefinition: β is the **handle** of the right sentential form γ=αβw if and  \nonly if S =&gt; \\*rm αAw =&gt;rmαβw  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nIn this definition, =&gt;rm specifies a rightmost derivation step, and =&gt; \\*rm  \nspecifies zero or more rightmost derivation steps. Although the definition of a  \nhandle is mathematically concise, it provides little help in finding the handle  \nof a given right sentential form. In the following, we provide the definitions  \nof several substrings of sentential forms that are related to handles. The  \npurpose of these is to provide some intuition about handles.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Definition: β is a **phrase** of the right sentential form γ if and only if  \nS =&gt;\\* γ=α1Aα2 =&gt;+α1βα2  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nIn this definition, =&gt;+ means one or more derivation steps.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nDefinition: β is a **simple phrase** of the right sentential form γ if and only  \nif S =&gt;\\* γ=α1Aα2 =&gt;+α1βα2  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nIf these two definitions are compared carefully, it is clear that they differ only  \nin the last derivation specification. The definition of phrase uses one or more  \nsteps, while the definition of simple phrase uses exactly one step.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nThe definitions of phrase and simple phrase may appear to have the same  \nlack of practical value as that of a handle, but that is not true. Consider what a  \nphrase is relative to a parse tree. It is the string of all of the leaves of the  \npartial parse tree that is rooted at one particular internal node of the whole  \nparse tree. A simple phrase is just a phrase that takes a single derivation step  \nfrom its root nonterminal node. In terms of a parse tree, a phrase can be  \nderived from a single nonterminal in one or more tree levels, but a simple  \nphrase can be derived in just a single tree level. \n\n \n\nI have read this passage many times and have made little progress in understanding these definitions. If anyone is able to either provide a detailed explanation or a practical example for each of these terms, I would greatly appreciate it.",

However, I've recently read wonderful reviews about Grokking Algorithms, and I saw an older post on this sub where people raved about A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms by Jay Wengrow.\n\nDuring/after the boot camp, I wanted to go over Cracking the Coding Interview (it's my understanding that this book goes over algorithm problems). \n\nWhich of the three books would you suggest for an absolute beginner that's just getting their toes wet in the CS/programming world?\n\nThanks!",

Considering we only have 3 months of development phase, I might find it impossible to finish the program with no background in machine learning at all. To be fair I have learned python on a programming level but that is it. Our current thesis is about a mental health clinic finder and a neural network chatbot.\r  \n\r  \nThe next problem we had is the sheer amount of confidentiality that we have to go along because of the sensitivity of the topic and the data itself to be given that is usually becomes the dataset. It would become close to impossible locally to find datasets that any organizations or hospitals would give permission.\r  \n\r  \nThe thesis would have its features:\r  \n\r  \n1.The chatbot would generally answer that are based on what they feel during the conversation between the chatbot and the user. What we need to find is basing off their symptoms, treatments and diagnosis on what they should actually do especially given by the fact that the pandemic happened. These instances commonly occurred due to isolations and the hindrances given likely increased stress and anxiety levels.\r  \n\r  \n2.Similarly to vaccine clinic finders that are already existing, this features the mental health clinics instead. It would use your location to find the closest clinics within your vicinity.\r  \n\r  \nMy questions are these:\r  \n\r  \n1.Are international datasets allowed? Given by the difficulty of my team to find local datasets. Would the structure of dataset itself differ from the ones that are usually available like say, US for instance?\r  \n\r  \n2.Given 3 months of development phase is all we have to do the program itself, we were tipped to use API as a way to make things easier for our end. Of course, with that sense, it's not going to be cheap as well. However, they also said OpenAI's API is available, whilst Google offers both paid and free API for things like the Dialogflow and maps. How much do they cost? especially for thesis purposes. Aside from OpenAI, what are good alternative API's for machine learning espeically neural network?\r  \n\r  \n3.While yes I'm a beginner to machine learning, I still need to study machine learning. What are the websites or free courses to learn and watch to, given by the 3 month phase I'm going to have?\r  \n\r  \nThese are my questions that still linger to my head on what to do as a student, because having a foundation to these would definitely help me a lot.

        "text": "Hi everyone. \n\nAs the title states I want to learn to understand torrenting on a low level. As a member of the community I would like to give back but before I do that I would like to understand how the whole system works. I have a basic understanding but not comfortable with the level that I am at.\n\nI would like to know more about:\n\nHow torrenting works a whole, the underlying protocol used, how torrenting can be detected by your service provider. the downsides of torrenting against other methods of sharing, how a VPN works.\n\nI think my biggest misunderstanding is rooted at not knowing how the web works under the hood and I am curious to find out.\n\nIf anyone has any books, videos, papers that they can recommend on the subject that would be a great help.\n\nMany thanks.",

The reasoning  was that I won't be able to use a desktop often  since I'll probably be moving around for apartments and doing work on campus or in cafes.\n\nI feel really conflicted as this was the first PC i've built and hold a lot of sentimental value, but my options are to drag it around or leave it in Indonesia. \n\nI really don't know what to do\n(Sorry if this is off topic)",
