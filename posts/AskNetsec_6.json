Surprisingly, MITRE ATT&amp;CK groups doesn't really cover either of these details.

In short, the intrinsic motivation is high and I see myself doing this for a long time. I'd like to share some resources I'm leveraging to help me begin my journey, and I would very much appreciate a critique of my approach:\n\n* [Windows Internals: System architecture, processes, threads, memory management, and more, Part 1 (Developer Reference)](https://www.amazon.com/Windows-Internals-Part-architecture-management/dp/0735684189) to understand and interpret endpoint activity.\n* [Must Learn KQL: Essential Learning for the Cloud-focused Data Scientist](https://www.amazon.com/Must-Learn-KQL-Essential-Cloud-focused/dp/B0B1B62JW2) to efficiently comb through data for my hypotheses.\n* [Learn Azure Sentinel: Integrate Azure security with artificial intelligence to build secure cloud systems](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Azure-Sentinel-artificial-intelligence/dp/183898092X) to understand the basics of our SIEM.\n* [Microsoft Sentinel in Action: Architect, design, implement, and operate Microsoft Sentinel as the core of your security solutions](https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Sentinel-Action-Architect-implement/dp/1801815534) for a more advanced understanding of our SIEM.\n* [Microsoft Security Operations Analyst Exam Ref SC-200 Certification Guide: Manage, monitor, and respond to threats using Microsoft Security Stack for securing IT systems](https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Security-Operations-Analyst-Certification/dp/1803231890) to expand my scope for managing threats within the Microsoft suite.\n\nWhere should I focus my attention first? What blogs/podcasts should I subscribe to to stay up-to-date on the latest attacks and how they work? Are there any important information sources I'm missing? At work, I'm in the process of understanding business requirements, identifying crown jewels, revealing where we do and do not have visibility, defining a baseline/what is \"normal,\" etc., etc.\n\nThanks in advance for your guidance!",

        "author": "Ill-Boysenberry-5102",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/zgno68/awful_offer_from_spacex_for_security/",
        "text": "TLDR: I feel like SpaceX is taking advantage of the fact that I really want to work for them. Offer TC 117k, 95k base 22k stock, Hawthorne, LA area. I feel like I deserve better salary and treatment, **but maybe I am being dramatic**. I am super conflicted. Graduating in December with a masters in cyber from a prestigious school for that.\n\nFeels free to skip all of this below down to negotiating leverage, more of vent anyways I guess---\n\nI stated repeatedly throughout the interview process that I had been training to work for them for a long time and that is the truth. I went into a very rigorous master's program with the soul purpose of getting into SpaceX, to build up the skills I needed to do security on space systems. In the program, I specialized in systems programming, binary exploitation, and really intense reverse engineering, the whole experience has been by far the hardest thing I've ever done. During my master's program, I even received multiple FAANG internships for security but went to a defense contractor so I could learn how real state-sponsored hacking works from the inisde (it's fucking crazy) all because I thought it would help get into SpaceX. I lead successful hacking teams and even contributed a BUNCH of code to a moon rover that will actually be going to the moon.\n\nWell, I was able to achieve what I set out to do by working my ass off, but the starting position is really not ideal, and the pay is honestly crap compared to what I could make somewhere else. I knew it wasn't going to be great, but I'm just coming to terms with the fact that they want me to work in Hawethorne, LA for TC 117k a year, my base pay without stock is actually even below 100k. Frankly, I am not thrilled about moving to LA, and even less thrilled by the fact that they are offering me less than what my internship's return offer is (145k in San Antonio TX, dirt cheap living). I had an internship at Amazon that was going to pay 150k equivalent even. I am highly confident that I would be able to make near 200k if I were to continue my job search as that is what my peers of similar skill level are making. Basically, it seems like there is a total disconnect between what SpaceX wants to pay for the skills I have cultivated and how the broader market values them.\n\nI'm super mission-focused, and the thought of working at SpaceX securing impactful space vehicles is what made me push so hard for the last 2+ years, but if I go to work at SpaceX I will start off doing security operations with no guarantee of being able to switch over to do product security. On top of that, as I said before, it seems like they are exploiting my excitement for working on the company's mission. I don't know, maybe that's just what they pay everyone.\n\n**Negotiating Leverage**\n\nThe only offer I have in hand is the return offer from my internship, 145k in San Antonio. Not sure how useful that is since I mentioned I was not that serious about going back. The other leverage I have is that I have the base pay statistics for people coming out of my master's program, and base without bonus or stock the average is 129k, (much more with the other goodies included) compared to SpaceX's offer of 95k base. I was extra busy this semester and couldn't secure any offers during it, so nothing else there. Not in the strongest position, but I think it's workable.",

I don't want to violate any rules =)\n\nAs a teaser, here would be the differences I would talk through:\n\n* Old protocols no longer supported\n* Simpler Cipher Suites\n* Fewer Cipher Suites\n* All TLS 1.3 Ciphers are AEAD\n* Forward Secrecy\n* Removed Custom DH Groups\n* Shorter Handshake (One Round Trip)\n* Most of the Handshake is Encrypted\n* Client Certificate is Encrypted\n* Many, Many more Session Keys\n* TLS 1.2- Renegotiation is gone\n * Replaced with Key Update &amp; Post Handshake Authentication\n* Session Tickets no longer risk original session\n* Session Tickets protected by TLS session\n* Session Resumption &amp; PSK mode combined\n * Adds option for additional DH Exchange \n * Adds option for Early Data / 0RTT \n\nWhen I've done this before (for the sake of time) I've skipped the last few differences and instead talked about Middleboxes and how they hindered upgrading to TLS 1.3, and the things TLS 1.3 did to \"get through\" misbehaving middleboxes.",

        "text": "So I understand the purpose of regenerating a session ID after a state change such as authenticating, i.e. to prevent session fixation. What I'm not clear on is why this would be necessary after a password change ([as recommended by OWASP](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html#renew-the-session-id-after-any-privilege-level-change)).\n\nIf an attacker has hijacked the victim's session cookie, yes, invalidating that sessionID would kick the attacker off, but why should that be done specifically at the time of a password change? Is it because there is an assumption that if a user is changing their password, that they may suspect their account has been compromised? Otherwise, a password change seems like an arbitrary time to regenerate the sessionID.\n\nIn the case of an attacker who has stolen the victim's password: the attacker will have his own session. Regenerating the sessionID after password change would not affect the attacker's session, would it? (On that note -- is the current best practice to invalidate ALL sessions after a password change? I seem to be getting varying answers on this.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTIA",

Complete cluserfuck!\n\nSince the day I started, everyone at the company receives frequent spear phishing emails. The emails always pretend to come from the CEO. If you reply they will eventually ask you to purchase gift cards.\n\nAs soon as I started with the company we enabled email protection and stopped the attackers from being able to spoof our CEO's email address. Now they just open random gmail addresses like [cucksucker3000@gmail.com](mailto:cucksucker3000@gmail.com) and pretend to be our CEO to other employees, these get flagged by our spam filter, and email system policies DMARK/DKIM/SPF, etc.\n\nWe train our users on cyber security, to spot phishing emails if they get through. Because of all this I don't think these attacks have been very fruitful to the attackers. Recently they've moved on to something new. They are now texting some of our employees from random out of state phone numbers pretending to be the CEO. THIS IS NEW TO US. Our personal cellphone numbers are not published on our website.\n\nDoes this mean they are looking up our employee's cell phone numbers? Cross-referencing them with the data that they scraped off of our website?\n\nHas anyone else experience this recently where spear phishing emails escalate to spear phishing SMS messages. It really seems like it's from the same attackers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTIA",
