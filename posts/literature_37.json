        "text": "Hi everyone, \n\nI just watched a BBC production of *Hamlet* after having read it a few months ago, and I wanted to share my thoughts. \n\nMy interpretation of *Hamlet* is that Hamlet is a character who occupies two realms throughout the play- the realm of the everyday living or what we may call ordinary reality, and the realm of death where life is put into a much broader existential focus. To be more clear, Hamlet has a preoccupation with death that removes him partway from the day-to-day living and acting as the prince and heir of Denmark. The play details his transition from this halfway point to the realm of death (both when he literally dies, but also when he fully accepts his inevitable death.)\n\nIn the beginning of the play, we have a scene where guards acting their rolls given to them by the state come across the Ghost. They are dumbstruck and terrified, and they immediately default to the scholar Horatio for instruction. This is noteworthy in that the guards, having encountered something other from the realm of Death, are unable to interact with it. They are blinded to the higher reality in acting out their given roles in society. They cannot communicate with death, and so turn to the scholar in the hopes that his knowledge may intervene.\n\nHoratio has a false start. The Ghost is about to speak just as the cock crows signifying the arrival at dawn. All of Horatio's scholarly pursuits have given him a small chance in comprehending death, but bookish learning isn't quite up to the task. Hamlet, partway removed from this world, is the only person who communicates with the ghost of the late King Hamlet. \n\nSo much of Hamlet's indecision, insanity, and inability to act is a result of his trying to operate in these different realms. I reject the idea that Hamlet simply \"goes insane\". That interpretation tends to trivialize and dismiss the inner workings of Hamlet. He isn't insane. Instead, he sees things on a much broader scale than the rest of us. He sees things that we do our best to avoid. \n\nWe now arrive at the famous \"To be or not to be\" soliloquy. \n\n&gt;To be, or not to be, that is the question:\nWhether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer\nThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,\nOr to take arms against a sea of troubles\nAnd by opposing end them. To die—to sleep,\n\nThis is a man contemplating his place in the broadest sense possible. He is trying to make a choice between living, acting out his role, and suffering the day-to-day misfortunes which would accompany ordinary reality, or does he bring the other foot over into death. \n\nAfter *Hamlet* returns to Denmark from his pirate misadventure, he has become something of an agent of death. At this point, he soul is almost all in the realm of death, and his body is a marionette. He has accepted his death, as indicated by several exchanges with Horatio\n\n&gt;Hamlet: To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it stopping a bunghole?\n\n&gt;Horatio: 'Twere to consider too curiously to consider so.\n\nHamlet has a perspective on all of life that allows him to imagine Alexander's body ground to dust and eventually mixing with the soil and being a part of all base uses. Even though Hamlet asks why the imagination doesn't think of these things, he's really asking why the imagination *normally* doesn't think of these things- clearly he is thinking them as he gives his speech.  Horatio gives the response of someone who has never thought of it before, he doesn't know. It's too queer. \n\nWhen Horatio tries to dissuade Hamlet from dueling with Laertes, the following quote is give:\n\n&gt;We defy augury. There is special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be, tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come. The readiness is all. Since no man of aught he leaves knows, what is't to leave betimes? Let be. \n\nHamlet is talking about leaving the world of the living. He has accepted his death. \n\n\nAs a last remark, I believe much of Hamlet's indecision can be understood as trying to navigate and find his place in these two realms. One could ask why Hamlet just didn't avenge his father's death once he learned that Claudius had murdered him? The answer is that such direct and immediate action would require him to still be fully immersed in the day-to-day character of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark. Since he was ripped out of that character, he is unable to act. His father's death forced him to come face-to-face with death in a way he never before had experienced. He fully comprehends the finality and inevitability of death, and with that the foolishness of the day-to-day happenings of the world. The far more pressing concern of rectifying himself to his inevitable death is on his mind. Only once he fully anticipates his death and truly accepts it is he able to act out his vengeance. But at that point, he's something of an agent of death, and we have a cataclysmic eruption of death at the end of the play. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

On the surface level it’s probably one of the best westerns I’ve read but Cormac’s game of “spot the literary references” will definitely go over most readers heads, mine included. I only caught the more obvious nod to paradise lost and the dashing babies one, but I’m sure I’m missing many more. Although it is easier than other pieces of literature ( Moby Dick,Ulysses, gravity’s rainbow) but you’ll miss a lot of the artistic skill by reading it early. I like how he maintains his gnostic perspective as well as his very vivid imagery. The book tends to lean towards being so violent it’s comical but the message of violence being a necessary thing for civilization can be lost in the gore fest\n\nOverall it’s an amazing book, and although it’s easy for beginners I wouldn’t recommend it to them",

        "text": "I recently got to look at the typescript held here in Austin and it's a fascinating document. Pynchon cut nearly 200 pages and essentially rewrote half of it within the span of three months from March to May in '62. The entire structure of the book was also altered, including swapping the ending. In the TS, the novel ends with what is now chapter 16, the final scene is Profane running off with the college girl towards the outskirts of Malta. \n\nThe chapter set in Southwest Africa during the Herero massacre he really struggled with. It was the last of his major rewrites and he was so frustrated with it he told his editor he was ambivalent towards it being included in the final draft. Without that chapter, the book is incredibly different than the one we know today.\n\nAnyways, pretty neat stuff. Certainly helped diminish my \"author as god\" belief. I absolutely love the novel. The letters from Fausto to his daughter is one of the most heartbreaking and beautiful chapters Pynchon has ever written. The typescript is certainly much worse than what we actually got, more farcical and self-serious/overwritten at times. Corlies Smith had a true vision for what he thought Pynchon was going for and managed to bring it out of him. ",
