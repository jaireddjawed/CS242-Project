        "text": "Hi everyone. First of all, thank you in advance for your help. I'm desperate for some career advice so I can stop wasting my time and find a job.\n\nAbout me:\n\n- Genuinely passionate about tech all my life.\n- Out of the workforce for 3 years that I spent looking after my child. Before that I was in customer support in a bank.\n- Self taught Python, MySQL, HTML, CSS at a beginner level.\n- Azure DP-900 certified.\n- Ideally looking to start with a part time job or something fully remote.\n- Living in a small city in Cumbria, UK.\n\nI've been trying to go the developer route because it seems like a popular career path and I do really enjoy it, but sometimes I feel I'm just wasting my time. There aren't many developer jobs in my city and everything that I see on job boards is for seniors. Junior positions are in big companies in big cities, and 99% of them require some days in the office. Finding a fully remote job as an apprentice seems impossible. And I also find this route overwhelming. It seems that it will take me 5 years to learn everything I need to know to get an entry level job. Also as a mum work-life balance is the priority for me and this career path doesn't seem that way.\n\nSo I've been thinking of changing career paths and going into any it help desk position, since usually they don't even require much CS knowledge and there are part time jobs in that area. I'm thinking of getting the CompTIA A+ cert, then learning about network or cyber security or any of those paths.\n\n Does that make any sense? Or is there anything else I need to consider before I change my goals?\n\nThank you!!!",

        "text": "So, this is a question geared toward engineers who have successfully utilized this course as preparation for system design interviews. But for those who don't know, Grokking the System Design Interview is a course on educative.io that is frequently suggested as a popular system design interview preparation course. For context, most of the chapters are \"building blocks\", diving into different system components such as load balancers, CDNs, databases, message queues, etc. After the building blocks are a bunch of system design questions which each have their own chapter.\n\nI picked up this course at the suggestion of a former coworker. I'm currently about 40% of the way through, just 5 building blocks away from getting to the actual design questions. However, I feel like I'm missing something here in terms of how \"ready\" I feel to answer a system design question. That is to say, not very ready at all. Obviously I'm less than halfway through the course, inb4 not even halfway through omegalul I know, but I'm making this post to see if I'm on the right track or not.\n\nIn terms of my experience taking the course so far, I can understand what they're going for. The idea is to go in depth on each building block, and then use them for future building blocks and system design questions. I have a general idea of what the function of each component is and why we'd want to use them, but I find that the course throws so much jargon at me that it's hard to understand the details of each component in depth. For instance, when I was reading the pub-sub section, I was just beginning to understand the difference between a message queue and a pub-sub system, and suddenly we're diving into the design talking about brokers and cluster &amp; consumer managers. Like, bruh it feels like we jumped to something completely different that could also take me down a Google search rabbit hole. And trying to wrap my head around all these details, the idea that I'll know how to coordinate each of these building blocks and put together a cohesive design in a 45 minute interview feels further and further away. I don't know if anyone else has experienced what I'm going through now with Grokking, but as someone studying all this stuff for the first time, there's parts where I'm reading and I just feel my brain shutting off in real time. I'd hope I'm not the only one who's felt this way.\n\nThere are only two possible conclusions I can come up with. Either I'm truly remedial and Grokking the SDI is child's play for everyone else (fwiw I only have 1.5 YOE, I'm doing this bc more than one role I'm interviewing for has system design in their interview process), or the true value of this course comes in the system design interview examples, which I have not gotten to yet, and either those chapters beautifully tie together the building blocks leading up to them, or people just memorize the system design interview chapters. Or I could be wrong and maybe there's a better way for me to utilize this material. Anyone who's utilized this course successfully for a system design interview, please let me know if there's anything else I should be doing beyond just reading through the information. Thank you!",

        "text": "I could remember the beginning of my career like it was yesterday, and I miss it. I would have a meeting or two in the morning, a few tasks for the sprint. All in all, I'd code maybe 3 hours a day, guaranteed. I was then able to use all the extra time to do home chores and other personal obligations, and my work-life balance was beautiful.  I had time to make breakfast, get a lunch, make dinner. I logged off everyday knowing I checked off a milestone, went to bed by 10 PM, was up by 8 AM. It was beautiful clockwork.\n\nFast forward to now, I spend an entire day glued to my monitors, sometimes even holding my pee until I can't anymore. I sleep maybe 6 hours a night on a good day, typically closer to 4. Come the weekend, I'm just making up sleep and chores that I wasn't able to get done during the week. \n\nAnd the worst part? I probably achieve less per day now than before. Statistically, I'm doing less tasks of the same difficulty. I've tried and tried to find a reason as to why I spend more time working but less time actually getting work done and here's what I found:\n\nMy daily calendar has more meetings now. On a typical workday, my first meeting starts at 9 AM, and fast forward a few back to back meetings until about 1 PM. At around 1, I then start to get some breathing room to start tackling what I intended for the day, but I typically then get sidetracked with emails, unscheduled calls from John or Doe asking for help with this or if I know anything about this, PR reviews. By the time I'm done with the bureaucratic stuff, it's already 4:30 PM, I'm burned out for the day, I achieved nothing on my personal work milestones for the day, I have stuff to finish for the sprint, and more often than not, I also have time sensitive stuff to finish prior to the next morning. \n\nBut I still have home chores to do. So I end up not doing most chores, leaving them for another time (and that typically pans out to be the weekend). I haven't cooked, so takeout. I haven't spent any personal time, I haven't spent any time with my significant other. And of course, no time for exercise.\n\nAnd above all, I still have work to finish. So inevitably, I end up logging back on late. Like now, for example. I'm typing this thread as I've just finished a time sensitive thing that I just haven't had time for in the workday, it's past 3 AM local time.",

        "text": "Graduated a few months ago with CE degree and I've realized I didn't take advantage of my schooling whatsoever in helping improve my chances at landing a job. No experience, no internships, basically never went out of way to do anything software/hardware related outside of my classes/projects. This was mostly due to pursuing other hobbies and not taking my potential career more seriously. As a result, I don't have much to bring to the table besides by knowledge of C/C++, bit about programming microcontrollers, and limited knowledge of electrical circuits. I know this my fault and I can't change the past, so all I can do is try to improve from now. I've applied for jobs near LA and cities/counties nearby, but it feels like there is just too much competition with others being much more impressive candidates. I don't doubt my ability to be able to pick up new skills, but not quite sure what exactly to focus on to make myself more appealing to potential employers. \n\nI am always debating with myself on what to spend my time doing/learning (web development, front end, back end, SQL, all these technologies I've heard of but I see lots of job descriptions listing, leetcode, improve DSA knowledge, learn to use command line on unix OS,  work on side projects, search for jobs that I least pass one qualification, etc). \n\nI honestly just want to get my foot in the door and gain some relevant work experience anywhere tech related, and learn and use my skills in a work setting so I can eventually be qualified for better jobs. I was hoping to do an internship, but didn't realize you can't anymore once you graduate. I don't really care about the pay at the moment, the only thing I am not willing to do is relocate. I know a few people who were in the same situation as me, and they were able to secure jobs, but only by relocating to a different state such as Utah, Oklahoma, etc. I have my reasons for not wanting to relocate, but maybe I am being unrealistic given my situation, where I live, and should seriously consider it at some point. Sorry for the rant, I am just not sure what course of action to take at the moment. I really just want to start my career and start working, but am worried instead I am just going to waste my time staying indecisive and being in the same spot a year from now working an irrelevant part time job.",

My main reason for starting out in networking was due to a campus job that I really enjoyed after shortly switching my major to computer science, but now as I get to higher level comp sci classes I find myself wanting to make the switch. How would you all recommend that I shift into development after I graduate? This summer, I will be studying DSA to prepare for technical interviews as well as trying to find a full-stack project to work on to have another project on my resume. As for my networking background, I have a strong understanding of networking fundamentals, and earned my CCNA last summer. Will these two networking internships make it harder for me to get into development or am I still early enough in my career where this switch won't be too hard to make? I am not concerned with getting into a FAANG company and will be more than happy with a good development job that will give me good experience.",

I am entirely using Python (w/ Django) and have not used Java in many many years, with no particular desire to go back to it.\n\nMy question is:\n\n1. Since the high level concepts should be similar, can I take those two coursera classes without really having to do significant Java programming? Has anyone taken them before and know how heavy they rely on writing/reading code vs. more language-agnostic concepts?\n2. If I were to stick to Python-focused courses. Any recommendations on which ones I should sign up for? For example [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-patterns-python/?src=sac&amp;kw=design+patterns) might be a good fit, but along with some of the other python classes listed, I am worried it will be more on the \"learn how to program\" side of things than focused on teaching an experienced engineer how to design systems, APIs, and database models.\n\nAnyone with more experience in these topics or who's taken these topics able to point me in the right direction here?",

As I inquired further it comes to light that I must get 2 booster shots that I did not previously receive.\n\nThis sounds ridiculous right?  I could maybe see 1, but 2?   Also, if a new booster comes out I would be required to get it within 2 months or I loose my job, no exceptions.  This is a tech company and not a company in the medical field or anything even close to the medical field.\n\nThis is the first company that I have talked to that has even mentioned requiring the covid vaccine and boosters.  Is this common at other companies or is this one company just an outlier?",

        "text": "I see a lot of people cheer about having less managers from the meta news lately. Coming from a company with a relatively flat structure I saw a couple potential issues that 1) the management/cross team work didn't necessarily reduce, so senior engineers be come de facto managers without a title or sometimes become free for all to who ever have the balls to boss people around and 2) promotions are limited because high ups say it requires one to take up \"management responsibility\" and cross team work to have visible achievement. but then there is no manager/promotion positions available and people leave.\n\nJust curious is it because the software field generally can have great achievements by individuals without a large supporting structure and collaboration? Or is it that in this field TC is not tied to role and any individual contributors can keep climbing in comp and influence without a ceiling? In my field a big achievement normally come from effort of 5-6 different teams/expertise and sometimes it just needs someone with a manager authority to pull it all together without being swarmed by lower level tasks.",

        "text": "Hello all! I'm a 3rd year Sociology major at a state university. Long story short, I only really started thinking about life after college a little less than a year ago, and I realized my degree doesn't open up the kinds of opportunities I want. I figured that since my main priority with a job is that I can do it remotely (I'm autistic and have ADHD and I discovered during the pandemic that I'm significantly more productive when I'm in control of my environment), something tech-adjacent would be best. Problem is, my degree is very much not tech-related, so I'm spending my weekends learning programming (C++ primarily) with my hobbyist friend. What I'm curious about is:\n\n\n-Is it even possible to get a job in the field without a CS specific degree? I've done some perusing beforehand and the job search seems really rough. I think I have enough time left before I graduate that I can pick up a [certificate like this](https://www.umsl.edu/cmpsci/undergraduate-studies/certificateincomputerprogramming.html). \n\n\n-How committed do I have to be to the science and all that stuff? While coding is far from the most boring thing I've done, I'm not particularly *passionate* about it and I really only view working as a means of feeding myself and funding life outside of work. As long as I make enough to support myself and I can continue lifting 6 days a week, I'll be happy as a clam. I've done some looking around and junior programmer (or whatever \"code monkey\" refers to) type positions seem ideal for me. I am much happier working with clearly defined expectations and tasks.\n\n \n\nThanks for the advice!",
