I did my best to respond in a supportive manner and making sure she knew I was happy for her and was fully supportive of her if this is what she wants to do. However, I also said, as calmly as possible, that this was a lot for me to process and I needed to take some time to think about things and went to stay at my sister's for a few days.\n\nI know coming out to me probably took a lot of courage and I'm sure she was worried about how I'd react. And she was probably right to do so, since this pretty much means the end of the relationship. I'm a straight woman, and I'm not attracted to women. I didn't want to just immediately go \"I'm happy for you, also I'm breaking up with you\" because I knew that would make things worse and make her feel awful.

I wanted to reward her and she wanted an ice cream, so we went to the ice cream shop. When I gave her the ice cream, she said \"thank you, dad\" and rushed back in the car. I was stunned. I didn't know how to react. She never called me dad, she normally call me by my name or nickname. She seemed to not realize she had done it so I acted normally and brought her back home and we celebrated with Rose.\n\nI don't know what I should do if she calls me dad again.

The details are too fitting. Anyway, yes, I suggested we move down to his city. I said we could start looking for a place immediately. It's true that I agreed that we would live in the car and get a gym membership. He waited until we got down there to tell me we would be staying with a female friend of his for a few days. I was fine with that. A few days turned into 3 weeks. \n\nHe completely neglected me and our relationship suffered. I get that he's adjusting to a new job but that's no excuse. Every time his friend needed something, he would jump right up. He was so busy kissing her ass that he didn't have time for me. He expected me to clean her house. I refuse to be a maid especially when I wasn't even given a choice in being there. I presented the idea of us living apart for awhile until he got more established. He wouldn't hear of it. \n\nHe would follow me outside and prevent me from calling anyone and even snatched my phone out of my hands every time I tried. He wouldn't even sleep unless I was with him because he was afraid of me *sneaking off* as he put it. He kept saying he needed me there because he loves me and needed me to get a place. It was obvious after awhile that he just wanted me there because he wouldn't be able to get a place without me. \n\nI'm sure he's probably just going to stay with her but I don't care anymore, it's not my concern. It became clear to me that he didn't care what I wanted, he wanted to do whatever he wanted and just expected me to deal with it. He would accuse me of being rude to him and his friend. This despite the fact that she completely ignored me. Even when I was standing right next to him, she would act like I wasn't there and only talk to him. \n\nHe made no attempt to fix it. It also became clear to me that she expected him to act like Dad to her son and act like a partner to her. He couldn't understand why I seemed jealous even though the minute we arrived, he stopped touching me and started ignoring me. He started doing her favors and spending all his free time with her. Then when I brought it up, he said I was making baseless accusations. He tried to excuse them closing her bedroom door by saying her son closed it.\n\n Be that as it may, he should have immediately opened it. This happened twice yet he couldn't understand why I didn't trust him. I waited until he calmed down by pretending everything was cool then when everyone went to sleep, I took his fob, got my stuff out of the car and ordered an Uber. I went to a hotel and then got a bus ticket the next day. I'm staying with a friend in my hometown until I find a new place. \n\nOf course he blew up my phone so I just blocked him but not before telling him it was over. He seems like a player anyway, most of his friends are women and he was also friends with his ex who he talked about CONSTANTLY. He never shut up about his female friends, a few that he told me that he considered dating in the past. \n\nI just wasn't happy and he refused to let me break up with him. He was showing a lot of red flags and I was done. I've learned my lesson about moving in with someone I hardly know. I'm just glad to be away from him and his drama that he always accused me of creating. Thank you for reading. \n\nTL;DR Update to the situation where my ex lied to me to get me to his hometown then trapped me with him in his female friend's house. He spent all his free time with her and stopped having sex with me yet couldn't understand why I was jealous. He also expected me to clean her house despite paying her. \n\nHe wouldn't let me leave despite me telling him several times that I wanted to break up. He just wanted what he wanted and expected me to deal with it. I escaped a few days ago and I'm back in my hometown. He blew up my phone but I told him that it's over and blocked him.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1678657648.0},{"title":"My girlfriend (31F) told me that my (28M) penis is too small","author":"ThrowRA-Scorn","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11ptfcj\/my_girlfriend_31f_told_me_that_my_28m_penis_is\/","text":"Hello all,\n\nI've been in a six month relationship with a woman that I met through online dating.

He's only in it for the money and prestige. That's fine, ppl do it for different reasons. However, it bothers me,  because I never did it for the money, but because I genuinely love it.

We were long time friends for 10 years before we decided to take the leap on our feelings for one another at the end of 2018. It has been a toxic cross country LDR consisting of me being a fool and prioritizing him every single day to help him navigate the challenges and serious burnout of medical residency. He was always explosive with anger refusing to have open, mature communication and everything has and always will be my fault. Will never admit to one thing wrong or willingness to provide a safe space to communicate to resolve any misunderstandings. I ruined my career and tried to close the gap 3x and move to be closer emotionally and build a foundation to build in the connection and bond I thought we had. Every single time, he led me on with false hope. When time came to pull the trigger and close the gap, he suddenly wasn\u2019t \u201cready\u201d\u2026 again, very long history of toxic abuse. I blame myself, I knew better I held on to the false hope he was great at making me feel and believe. \n\nTwo weeks ago on a Tuesday evening I was \u201chis world\u201d the next day on Wednesday, with zero emotion\u2026 he managed to conjure up two trivial occurrences that took place 2\/2.5 years ago that we\u2019re non issues then\u2026 managed to revisit and REACH to create a narrative to justify breaking up with me suddenly. I will say that the timing is suspicious. One week prior to him, breaking up with me, one of my closest friends did take my phone while I was in a procedure and respectfully inform him that she cannot manage to bite her tongue anymore and see how much he has broken my soul even stolen my sou.. essentially, articulating the laundry list of reasons how his narcissistic abuse has made me unrecognizable. He took what she said and blame shifted as if I\u2019m a lying manipulator. I also think it\u2019s pretty convenient that he is graduating residency June of this month and he no longer needs me. I felt I was just an emotional crutch for him, and now that I\u2019m no longer needed and he is free of medical training, I was discarded so fast like old garbage. \n\n\nIt is imperative I admit, that I come from a long history of childhood trauma and abandonment. I am neurodivergent but I respect and communicate to a fault. I say all of these things to admit that he consistently would gaslight me and abuse me verbally psychologically and emotionally when I stopped, feeling loved, feeling, heard, and feeling seen and not allowed to say one word, it would exacerbate my emotional dysregulation, which would in return cause me to Lash out in tears and trying to scream over him to get a word in but was punished for my reaction to his abuse so when he broke up with me, he says my behavior and \u201cinconsistencies are concerning\u201d He never let me have the opportunity to tell him you never got to see my real behavior. You only instigated an argument every day and in my response to your abuse, you highlight that I\u2019m the problem.

I told him that I expect to be an equal in our marriage and in our family, if he can\u2019t do that, then I can\u2019t be a part of our marriage at all.\n\nMy husband said that was fine by him, I\u2019d get what I wanted and he\u2019d be fine on his own. I told him that wasn\u2019t what I wanted at all. We went back and forth on it for a while and I honestly started to feel like I was watching the end of our marriage play out in front of me. I just knew that something about the way he was talking wasn\u2019t right, he kept implying things that were so far out of the woodwork I knew that something else was going on.\nI got him to admit that he had a conversation with my dad, who loves our kid but is a little less sold on my husband. Dad got it in my husband\u2019s head that I rushed into things for the sake of our kid and I\u2019m liable to pull the plug on our marriage at any point. My husband thought it was ridiculous until I said no to the sleepover, because we\u2019d be visiting family. He saw it as me agreeing with my dad, instead of me having a safety concern. He got scared and got on the defensive.\n\nWe decided to cancel our plans with my family this weekend (probably go LC for a while until Dad can shape up) and let our girl go to her sleepover. It was really nice to decompress after this week\u2019s chaos and we got the chance to actually talk through these major insecurities. I also feel super vindicated because our kid called at one this morning with a stomachache, asking to come home, but I did not vocalize that because I know when to not add kindling to a fire.\n\nThank you all again for the excellent advice and helping me get my head screwed on straight again.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678668312.0},{"title":"My(27M) wife (24F) says she doesn\u2019t see our marriage (3 yrs) working out","author":"Independent_Couple10","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11ptqny\/my27m_wife_24f_says_she_doesnt_see_our_marriage_3\/","text":"We had been living out of state for a few years and this past December, after a couple months of debating, figured it was best that she stayed home while we were visiting for the holidays due to ongoing depression issues and that I would go back out of state to get everything ready to move.

This might sound like a short time, but we moved in together very shortly after meeting, as we were excited about each other and ready to explore the commitment. I was incredibly excited about him and quickly introduced him to friends and family, and we became much more intwined over a short period of time. He's an incredibly special soul; deeply kind, hilarious, fun, adventurous, international. When I met him I thought, wow -- I've hit the jackpot. \n\nThere is, however, a very significant logistical and financial issue in the way. We come from different financial backgrounds (I have a large safety net; he has no safety net at all). I am normally a very 'love transcends all' type of person, but because of how horrifically he has mismanaged his finances, I've found that that's actually an untenable POV in aa relationship. Similar attitudes around money, retirement, risk, goal setting, are necessary for a relationship to be healthy - at least for me, as I've now found. Here is the background for this issue:\n\nWhen I met my bf he was working on a startup idea. Being an entrepreneur myself, I found this very attractive. Because he is outwardly magnanimous and intelligent, I had the impression 'Wow, he's really got this.' His startup is genuinely a good idea. He mentioned he had been working on the idea for 2-3 years and still hadn't launched, had any discussions about funding, had no traction and has not discussed the idea with prospective customers. Despite all these indicators which are known to raise immense red flags regarding a startup's prospects, I was impressed with the idea and the very extensive amount of research he had done on it. He mentioned he had self-funded from all the savings he had from a previous finance job; I figured he must have made an exhorbitant amount to carry him for years with no revenue. He also mentioned he had sued his former employer, which I thought was pretty badass, even after learning he was not successful in the lawsuit and suspecting it would severely damage his ability to return to that industry (reputation, inability to get a recommendation, etc).\n\nI asked him to move in with me for a little while to a city where I have a close community of other tight knit startup founders and investors. He agreed and once moving in he began to finally begin working on his startup in earnest; which is to say, refining the product, creating an investor deck, talking to investors, talking to potential cofounders, etc. That said, his progress was still very slow and he was absolutely torching what remained of his small runway (eating out every meal, lavishly spending on weekend trips, etc.) While this did give me pause, I felt confident he had what it would take to succeed - and I was also quite focused on my own startup.\n\nFast forward a few months and after 3 years of working on the startup he had what most founders put together in the first 3 months; that is, an outline for an MVP and a plan to raise funds. I opened my network to him, connecting him with great investors and friends who are CEOs of their own startups, all of whom offered him a wealth of advice. He is a profound procrastinator, does not complete things on schedule, and this began to frustrate me after our first six months of living together. With that said, even though it took much longer than I think it should've, he did get things done and go through the motions of a fundraise. However, by the time he had done this (Sept-Oct of '22), the market for venture capital had become immensely risk averse due to rising interest rates. Although of course there are other factors at play (investors' confidence in him, in his product) a golden window of easy money did elapse as he procrastinated. In the end, after months of additional work and tens of thousands of additional funds down the drain, he raised $0. This lack of success is in contrast to my own startup, which, while a far less complicated business, has seen success over the past year as I've executed very quickly.\n\nThat's OK - startups fail every day, and I don't judge him for it at all. I was having trouble with mine at the time, so I empathized and provided him with the best support I could. I made it very clear he should have an accurate picture of his runway and to start applying for backup jobs 3 months in advance of him running out of funds. Despite promising to do that, he did not.\n\nAs the end of his fundraise in October approached, I became more adamant about him having a backup plan. I became angry he had not begun applying for jobs earlier. I think this is very justified considering we spoke about it and agreed on what should happen. He began taking out additional lines of credit. I remember talking to him about this time and explaining how bad it is to be racking up debt at a 24% APR; it becomes incredibly difficult to pay this off. He seemed to not understand this, either conceptually or in terms of its severity. I have literally never paid credit card interest in my life and never taken on debt I could not pay off on time, so obviously this flashed a warning sign.\n\nFast forward five months. It's now March, and he moved back in with his parents in January. He is well over $100k in debt. He has applied for many jobs, albeit, not all of the ones he's well qualified for, just the ones he has a preference for. He has gotten all the way to the last round on several, but nothing has come through. I can empathize with the job hunt being difficult especially in the current macroeconomic environment. However, it's becoming harder and harder to overlook the fact that he has been out of work for Four Years, that he cant get a positive recommendation from\nhis last employer because he sued them, and that he's not applying to everything he's qualified for. \n\nI personally find it absolutely unconscionable for him to take on that amount of debt. It greatly calls into question (1) his ability to plan for a sustainable future and (2) any willingness on my part to fuse finances with him in the future; ie, to ever get married.\n\nI have still done my best to support him. I'm always saying 'you've got this, something will come through, you can do it.' I send him job posts via email that he's qualified for. However if I mention anything like 'Have you applied to any jobs today?' 'Maybe you could apply for some things that are outside X industry,' he gets very angry with me. Yesterday I was looking at LinkedIn job posts for him and handed him my phone and nicely said 'What about this one?' and he said very angrily 'It's not productive to show me that right now'. I'm also not the outlier here; my friends and his parents are all deeply worried about the severity of his situation, so it's not like I'm oversensitive to it.\n\nAt a certain point I need to wonder -- am I going down on a sinking ship? Have I tied myself to somebody who, despite my love for them, takes on unconscionable levels of risk so as to make every marrying them unpractical? \n\nI am still holding on because I think if he is successful in getting a job, maybe things will change, and maybe he'll learn from this and it will never happen again. \n\nWhat's clear to me after a year and a half of being together is he has an executive function disorder. He cannot execute on things quickly. His initial startup action items should have taken 3 months, but they took 3 years. When we play games,\nmake decisions, he takes an incredible amount of time to decide on things and is plagued by indecision. On a recent job interview, he was strictly given 4 hours to complete a case study; he returned it to them 12 hours later.\n\nWhile of course he is most impacted by his decisions, I am greatly impacted as well. My mental health and quality of life have taken a significant dive over the past 6 months. We can't plan a future, a life together - we have no idea where we're going to even live (contingent on where he's able to find employment, as I WFH). We can't go out with friends or do fun things or take trips and make memories because he can't pay for anything. \n\nI love this guy very much. Most times when I look at him I feel nothing but love for him. That's why I'm still here. But this is becoming far too significant to ignore and the stress of it is really impacting my life and the success of my business. My ideal option would be to not break up and to just see him get himself together, but given his extensive track record I have doubts about that. I love him, but I also feel like I deserve to be with somebody who has their shit together. \n\nWhat should I do?","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1678629087.0},{"title":"Should I 21M forgive my best friend 22M friend for kissing a girl 20F that I was talking to?","author":"ThrowRA14392193","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11pyhty\/should_i_21m_forgive_my_best_friend_22m_friend\/","text":"Should I forgive my best friend friend for kissing a girl that I was talking to?\n\nSo basically I met this girl 5-6 weeks ago and we started spending a lot of time together because we live in the same apartment complex. We liked each other and we were sleeping every day at each others doing different stuff. However, I did not like her as much as she liked me tbh. She was a cool girl to be friends with, but I just could not see her as a potential long term partner for different reasons (values, life, interests,etc.). I could tell that she liked me a lot and caught feelings. She started getting mad over not replying her texts and would message me good night and good morning texts every day and would tell me she misses me every day as well.\n\n I did not tell anyone about her, but my best friend. I told my friend that I liked her, but the biggest red flag that I could see in her was that she can lie sometimes explaining it that she doesn\u2019t want make me mad or lose me. Everyone knows that i hate the most when people lie and I explained that to her. The problem that I also saw that she drinks like 3-4 times in a week (we are in college). So I started distancing myself from her last past week. So a week ago I told her that i do not want to have to do anything with her in sexual way and would prefer to be friends, to what she got extremely mad and started crying like crazy. At that time I was with my best friend at my place(we all live in the same apartment complex)  and at that time i told her to come over and talk about it. I tried explaining it to her that I like her only as a friend, but she started even crying more and my friend told me he can talk to her if i want and explain her that me myself is hard to date and that kind of stuff so she gets reassured and maybe gets over it. Tbh I always knew from the first time i met her that she would be my friends type so I told him that you can shoot your shot once she over me. \n\n\nHowever, 4-5 days ago she came up to me and talked to me that she will change and stop her drinking and will change for better to be with me to which I agreed. Basically, we chilled and hung out couple of times after that. \n\n2 days ago I flew to another state to meet my famly while all they stayed in the same place. So yesterday my best friend went out with my other friends and saw her at one party. So he calls me and asks if i mind if he shoots his shot to which I said NO. However, the catch is I forgot to tell him that we started talking again and he thought we are not talking anymore. Then later in the night he calls me drunk and asks again to which i thought that if my best friend likes her more then why not so I said yes he can and I explained to him that I still like her but it will be a test for her loyalty(which i know is very bad). So he made his move trying to kissing her to which he pushed him away and said that she can\u2019t because of me and she can\u2019t kiss my best friend.  And what pissed me off she said that if i did not exist maybe shed give it a shot. So later in the night my friend called me and told me everything about it. Then, she also texted me that she does not homie hop to what I said why did you tell him if i did not exist youd give it a shot to which I she replied she did not say that. I knew for sure that shes lying again and my best friend never everr lies to me. I told her that i will end everything if I find a proof that she lied to which she admitted she lied to not make me mad and that at the end of the day I still exist. I told her that i do not keep the liars around and blocked her everywhere. Then my friend calls me later that night and tells me that she told him to come over so he can help her fix everything and call me through his phone. I told him that i do not care at this point, but I told him that I changed my mind and asked him not to have anything to do with her. The later throughout the night she kept calling me from his phone until 8 am. \n\n\nWhen i woke up I called him and asked him about why you let her-call me so many times and why he stayed there until 8 am to which he said she was going crazy and was telling him that she would hurt herself if I do not forgive her. After all that he tells me that they at the end kissed for a moment , but stopped because of me and she told him that she still likes me. He apologized a lot of times andd even cried at one point to which I asked him to give me some time.\nNow, i know I am also not the best person and I first told him yes he can then said not to do anything. I am trying to be better.Just please tell should i forgive him or her? Because deep inside it also hurts that she kissed him and he did that.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678677133.0},{"title":"(32F)(35M) He wants to adopt I want a biological child","author":"ThrowRA-3589ad","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11pygs3\/32f35m_he_wants_to_adopt_i_want_a_biological_child\/","text":"My husband and I have been together for 7 years, Married for 2.

I have been giving her space so she can heal, its about time I considered her needs. But I don\u2019t know how to stop loving her. She called me and we spoke on the phone for 4 hours last week, it felt like old times, like nothing had ever happened between us. We caught up and laughed together.

Idk what advice would help at this point. We are both 25 and live together. My boyfriend has been working a lot of hours for the past few months, and our relationship has definitely struggled because of it. I\u2019m really big on quality time and we just haven\u2019t had much time in general. Well now that he\u2019s working less hours, what do you think he\u2019s choosing to do on his days off? Hang out with his fucking friends. And they don\u2019t just hang out. They do fun shit that he never does with me. They go to theme parks, adventure landing, top golf, the beach, road trips, nights out at multiple bars. The most I can get out of him is a short trip to the park\/beach or a dinner date - and I do not even like dinner dates. \n\n\n\nIts like he doesn\u2019t know how to hang out with me. Even if we were to go do all these things together, I\u2019m convinced he would not be the same fun version of himself he is around THE BOYS. I have told him endlessly that I don\u2019t mind him hanging out with his friends, it\u2019s the way he prioritizes them over me that\u2019s a problem. And it\u2019s the way he would rather do stuff with them! This past weekend I asked him if we could do a beach day and go to a town about 45 minutes away just for fun, and all he wanted to do was sit on his ass and play video games all day. But I guarantee you if one of his friends had hit him up to ask him to go on a quick beach trip, he\u2019d have said yes. \n\n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m really asking for advice, because I\u2019ve probably tried everything that you could even think to advise me. I have talked to him endlessly about this and there\u2019s really no difference. I am beyond tired of begging him to spend a day with me, and only getting him to actually do about half the things he promised. At this point I think the only thing I can do is give him a taste of his own medicine. But The issue is I don\u2019t have a giant core group of friends the way he does. I have a few close friends, and most of them don\u2019t even live near me.\n\n\n\nHe doesn\u2019t make an effort to include me with his friends, I get that they want to hang out alone sometimes but if they are hanging out constantly then yeah I would like to be included. But even when he does invite me, which is rare, I don\u2019t want to go because he is always inviting this one motherfucker that I can\u2019t stand. Most of the people in the friend group are indifferent towards this dude, so I don\u2019t know why my boyfriend feels a need to continue inviting him places knowing damn well that I won\u2019t go if he is there. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re childhood friends. His friend group is mostly surface level friendships that revolve around getting drunk together. Im not even joking, sometimes he will come home and not want to speak a word to me because he is \u201ctoo tired \u201cand then he gets on the game immediately and has all the personality in the world for his friends. I don\u2019t know what his problem is but he refuses to even acknowledge that there is one. \n\n\nI get that when you live with someone it\u2019s easy to fall into a routine, but it\u2019s a two person effort\u2026 I can\u2019t just keep constantly telling him he needs to make an effort.

Basically what a parent or guardian should be, but she needs a good one of those more than she needs a BF.

I feel horrible for her. But it\u2019s really damaging my mental health and motivation and social life (since her safety blanket is knowing I\u2019m there for her, so if I leave town or am tied up for a while, not okay) in the process.\n\nAnytime she senses any tension from my end in the relationship she gets super anxious and will nearly cry and start asking me if I\u2019m breaking up with her and how she doesn\u2019t know how she would make it without me.

Like the other day he was all quiet I'm presuming because I didn't really acknowledge him when I came home because I had a shit ton of work to do and he only perked up when I hugged him and gave him a little comforting speech. \n\nIt's very foreign to me since I was with someone for two years who was very much like me in the sense that he and I were very calm and collected and were able to speak about things calmly and introspectively, whereas my current boyfriend gets more heated and will say things in the spur of the moment that he'll later apoligize for which is something I don't really like since my dad is like this and u always told myself I would never end up with someone like that (love my dad though just something I found annoying lol). \n\nBut even though it's annoying to me I can't help but see a little boy when I look into his eyes that just needs me to tell him that everything's fine. My point is, is this something that will be constant? Is it just a phase since we're entering serious territory? Is this the sign of something deeper from his upbringing that he hasn't mentioned? And how do I deal with it? I want to be prepared so that I can diffuse any doubts he has and comfort him as much as possible but I don't know how. \n\nI really care about him and I want to understand and help him get over whatever this is.\n\nTldr: my boyfriend gets upset if I don't state clearly how much I like him.

Yesterday I met my fianc\u00e9e at our wedding venue for our 4 month out meeting to finalize details.  We drove to the venue separately because she was leaving straight from work.  Towards the end of the meeting she let me know her friend was dropping off her rental car and needed a ride home and asked if it would be ok.  I said yes thinking nothing of it as it wasn\u2019t that far from our home and I know her friend well.  I get home and tried to get in touch w her for the next 3 hours. No answer.  At approx the 1:30 mark I texted her friend and asked if she had made it to her ok.  I was very worried.  My fianc\u00e9e ends up coming home and says sorry it took longer than expected she hung out with her friend for a bit before leaving.  Ok no biggie just lmk next time please.  Her friend gets back to me a few minutes later and says \u201csorry I couldn\u2019t make it to the venue didn\u2019t see your fianc\u00e9e tonight.\u201d  I asked her why she would say this and she said she didn\u2019t know she can\u2019t control what her friend says and walked outside.  I\u2019m sketched out af by this point.  I have never done this but I looked at her phone records (yes I did and don\u2019t regret it).  I saw that when she went outside she called her friend that had texted me right after she went outside.  I also saw an hour long call with a number I didn\u2019t know on the way to the venue.  I asked her what rental place they went to and multiple other questions.  She had quick answers and they seemed legit.  I thought maybe I\u2019m crazy here I need to chill and sleep on it.  This morning I asked her to please see the text from her friend asking her to pick her up and I would apologize for questioning her the previous night.  She said no.  I said when I caught up to you yesterday on the way to the venue I saw you were on the phone who was that?  She said oh that\u2019s the friend I picked up later on.  That\u2019s when I knew for a fact she was lying.  I said I looked at her phone records and knew that wasn\u2019t true.  She then changed her story to say oh I needed to meet up w a coworker to discuss a patient.  Who is the coworker and why couldn\u2019t you discuss that over the phone?  I need to show him the techniques in person his name is Michael.  Ok I am sketched out beyond belief at this point we never lie to each other.  I asked to see the texts with Michael.  She said wouldn\u2019t let me see.  I said why not if there\u2019s nothing to hide. Are you having an affair?  Do you not want to be together anymore?  She pauses and proceeds to tell me all the things that are wrong with me.  I work too much I don\u2019t spend enough time w her don\u2019t listen.  I\u2019m astonished at this point all of this is news to me.  I put two and two together at this point I know something sketchy is going on.  I again ask to see the texts.  It took about a half hour of convincing to see these texts and they were crazy.  Sexual in nature and talking a lot of shit about me.  Also how she wanted to be with him and how they\u2019re essentially in love. She started this job 1.5 months ago (he is her coworker).  He is also 15-20 years older and divorced w multiple kids.  I have been financially supporting her for the last few months as she got back on her feet and was working extra so she wouldn\u2019t have to pick up a part time job.  We own a house which we both live in with 3 dogs and a horse.  Sorry for the novel I am beside myself right now.  I did not see this coming and we were going to get married in 4 months.  Any advice would help.\n\nUPDATE: \n\nAs an update, I was finally able to sit down with her tonight and go over this.  Again, she came in trying to blame me for what she did. Trying to justify the cheating and lying as a direct result of my lack of communication and listening. She said she wouldn\u2019t have had to start talking to this guy if I had been listening better. I spend too much time in the office working and don\u2019t dedicate enough time to her. I tried to explain that I was putting in extra hours to try and support her and the family financially while she was struggling so she wouldn\u2019t have to get a part time job. She said she would have rather gotten a part time job which makes no sense to me. She was under the impression that because this was short lived (one week she say) and \u201cthey only made out once\u201d that we could move past this. When I brought up the texts where she was trashing me and talking sexual with him she deflected hard and I got nowhere with that. I told her that I\u2019m not the reason that this is happening. She went too far and should have communicated with me or thought about the implications first. That I can never trust her again and this is all because of her actions. Whether she wants to try and justify this as my fault is up to her. At the end of this part it got a bit calmer - I said listen we just really need to figure out the house we own jointly and the three dogs. We came to the conclusion that Either I stay and buy her out or we sell and get new places. The dogs - one of us will get one the other two tbd. So that\u2019s where this left off tonight and will continue to keep you all posted on progress. Curious what you all would do about the house. Financially I can support it alone but it is nearly 3k square feet and 5 acres of land which was bought solely to have her horse. She is taking the horse when she leaves and boarding it at a barn.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1678580016.0},{"title":"I 31F just finalized my divorce with my ex 30M 2\/17 after two years of separation.

I would say maybe 3-4 months into relationship we got in a big argument and she blocks and cuts him off. I never questioned her again , I was  %100 trusting her. She never gave me any reason suspect on her .\n\nYesterday we were drinking and dancing outside . We came to my place and she fall asleep on my bed. I I know her phone password but never ever checked before, never needed to. Yesterday, I had some weird gut feeling and checked her phone -without her permission or telling her . OMG!!! . She still has been talking with her ex. Not just talking , meeting with him when I am not around , going to his work place , calling each other \u201clove\u201d , taking pictures together, trading pictures\u2026.. I did not see anything sexually but i don\u2019t need too.\n\nA boiling hot water dropped over my head , I could not believe a like 1 hour. I checked one more time and message , photo dates were 2022 and 2023 - so currently occurring-Not before me .

( she does not live with me , comes for weekends ) \n\nIf she brings up I checked her phone without her permission, what should I say ? \nIs my breaking up in my house a good plan ? \nPlease enlighten me !\n\nEDIT:  she wake up and saw me very down . I explained situation and asked her what\u2019s happening. She said they are only friends with her ex and those pictures are old.

She did not talk that much and I know any word will not change anything . \n\nI told her \u201cif you want this to work you need to block him and put the border. Even if you do that , I don\u2019t know if I can trust you again or still be in relationship again\u201d\n\nShe said she will not manipulate me by talking , her eyes got wet then mentioned they are only friends again , no sexual. Apparently he know me but wth ???!! Then she packed and left without saying a word. \n\nI texted her couple of screen shots that I took from their chats and said you say this to your friend ? Those screens shots were basically \u201c I love you my love , miss your smell etc \u201c  \n\nShe never texted back.

Last school year, we shared almost all of our \"social\" evenings together and up until 2-3 months ago that was still the case.\n\nImportant info: about 6 months ago, Sarah confided in me that she had just been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Apparently she had been having \"strange symptoms\" for several weeks (without telling me what they were), and after several MRIs she had received this diagnosis. We didn't talk much about it because she didn't want to tell me more, but I felt at that moment that she was very affected...which is logical.\n\nIn the last few months, even though we didn't talk about it anymore, I felt that she was more and more distant. She went out less and less, and even shut herself up in her room more and more. At first I thought she was too preoccupied with her studies, but then I started to worry and one night (about 2 months ago) I asked her if everything was okay. She just told me \"you're right, I'm not okay but I don't want to talk about it\". This made me feel unsettled and worried but I respected her wishes.\n\nBut the weeks went by and I saw her more and more isolated, she hardly saw anyone anymore unless they came to our house. So I talked to her again yesterday in private in my room, asking her if I had hurt her unintentionally...telling her that I value our friendship and that I am worried about her.\n\nI didn't expect her reaction She burst into tears and told me everything. She told me that the \"weird symptoms\" in question were that she had lost control of her bladder and that apparently no treatment was working. I remembered a time when we were in the car together and she suddenly asked me if we could stop to go to the bathroom before she started crying a few seconds later, and telling me she was having \"a bad headache\".\n\nI was shocked to see her in such distress. She told me that she had lost control of her bladder that day, that I hadn't noticed because she was forced to wear diapers and that this situation made her so anxious that she didn't dare go out anymore. She is unhappy not to see anyone but going out in her condition is too stressful for her to handle. She also told me that she felt extremely guilty about avoiding me because she values our friendship, and about that at least I tried to reassure her as much as possible.\n\nShe told me she's seeing a shrink about it. I tried to reassure her, to tell her that even though we live together I never noticed anything, I suggested that we go on short trips together...but she said \"I'm too uncomfortable, I'm destroyed with shame\".\n\nI want to help her, this situation takes me to the guts, but I don't know how to go about it...I care about her and our friendship. And I feel really awkward about it, I don't know how to react without being intrusive...do you have any advice?\n\nTL;DR : my roommate\/friend suffers from incontinence and it has a big impact on her social life\/self-confidence.

She started a new job 8 months ago and prior to that she was a stay at home mom to our 2 boys for about 4 years.\n\n She works 12 hour night shifts currently going in at 7 and for the longest time she would get up last minute, throw  her clothes on, tie her hair up, and head out the door. The last month or two she has been getting up earlier, fixing her hair and makeup before leaving. She also seems more upbeat at times before leaving when she used to dread going to work. \n\nAnother recent change is guarding her phone or at least getting upset if I ever touch it. For instance one day I grabbed her phone to call mine and find it and she accused me of snooping and invading her privacy. I wasn't, but this has never been an issue before. We have always been extremely open and honest with one another and have always had access to the others phone if ever necessary. \n\nThis all seemed to have started when she made a new friend at work. Her friend is a 20 year old single female. They text each other all the time and my wife talks about her all the time. \n\nI eventually let my suspicions and gut feelings that something was going on get the better of me and checked her phone while she was asleep. All but one message from her new friend were deleted. This is odd because all other conversations on her phone had messages dating back to months or years even. \n\nConfused I did confront my wife but not in an aggressive manner. She got very defensive and just told me to stop invading her privacy. \n\nI really am unsure of what to think. According to what my wife says her friend is straight and I have never had the slightest inclination my wife is attracted to women so her having an intimate relationship with her friend seems unlikely. \n\nI just really need feedback as weather I should be worried something is going on such as an affair or anything or if I'm just jumping to conclusions. \n\nIt's also worth noting that our relationship has been very stagnat lately. We're not intimate that often and she has been very withdrawn at times. Some of this could simply be due to life stresses and children though. \n\nI have absolutely nobody to talk about this with so any input is appreciated.\n\nSmall update: I have met this friend one time when I went to take my wife something to work and her friend stayed around but ignored me the entire time. I also have no proof that this friend is the one she's texting all the time. That's just who she tells me she's talking to and who's messages I noticed were deleted.","upvote_ratio":0.71,"created_utc":1678672669.0},{"title":"should i (f23) as him (m23) to be my boyfriend or is it too soon?","author":"CareApart9046","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11pupod\/should_i_f23_as_him_m23_to_be_my_boyfriend_or_is\/","text":"i (f23) have been seeing this guy (m23) for over a month now. we have gone on about 5 dates, he kissed me after the first. every time we hang out it seems natural and i\u2019ve really started to like him and i think that he could feel the same way as well. we have slept together twice and we both seem really into it. furthermore, we both said we aren\u2019t talking to others (but we haven\u2019t deleted dating apps as of yet).\n\ni really want to take the next step to define a relationship, or at least exclusivity. is it to soon to ask to be exclusive or to be bf\/gf? also, would a guy be alright if a girl initiated this conversation, or would he rather be the one to lead it?\n\nTLDR seeing this guy for a month. is it too soon to ask him to be my bf?","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1678666920.0},{"title":"9 Years and he still haunts me (F26, M26)","author":"Unlucky-Spend-2599","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11poy9r\/9_years_and_he_still_haunts_me_f26_m26\/","text":"\n\nContext : I went to high school with this guy, we fell for each other just one month after joining the class.

I wanted to be with him, but I had things that I needed to work through before I could be with anyone. There are a lot more details but we went back and forth for about a year.

We started texting a few nights ago, and he asked to see me in person to talk. I had plans this weekend, so we caught up over the phone which I think was for the best anyways. When we caught up, he told me he got a girl friend and they broke up. Over the course of the two months we didn\u2019t speak. I had no idea that he had a girlfriend because I was really trying to heal from the loss of not only someone I was romantically interested in, but also the loss of someone who was my best friend so I made it a point to refrain from keeping tabs. I felt like I was in an okay enough position to be friends with him because I\u2019ve been working on myself relentlessly. Then I was hit with him giving me details of his relationship with someone new and the way things ended and him asking me for advice on what he should do because it\u2019s all very fresh and he really liked this girl.

Last summer me and this girl went out on 2 dates before she had to go back to school (last weeks of summer) she said she just wanted to get fucked before summer ends so that she\u2019ll have slept with more than just one person before going on a semester abroad for college. We never fucked, we made out on the dates and felt each other up, she touched my dick and said something under her breath I didn\u2019t catch. she backed out when I proposed we take it back to my place. I had a great time on the dates, she said she did too.but I said that I guess we remove eachother now. And she said that she didn\u2019t want that and sent a sad face, so we\u2019ve never removed each other off of snap and talk occasionally, and she had asked for me to send dick pics which she saved (thought it was weird but I\u2019m a horny young adult so I sent) she\u2019s made comments about it, and I kinda feel like that\u2019s all I am to her.\n\nFast forward a few months to today, still been talking occasionally. I popped the question of why we\u2019re still talking after she\u2019s been in another state this whole time and I don\u2019t see us meeting up and we don\u2019t really talk a lot. To which she replied with \u2018idk, i\u2019m not like running out of snapchat friends or anything so I like only maybe lose out on something if i remove u\u2019. I didn\u2019t really understand that so I just said that I\u2019ll leave it as is, and that us still talking every other week without a prospect of meeting up just confused me.\n\nI just feel like she wants to keep me around so if she\u2019s ever back in town she can call me up and get dicked down. Any opinions are welcomed. Considering just removing her off snap, because of this and don\u2019t know if it\u2019s an overreaction on my end.\n\nTL:DR: Old fling never hooked up with saved my dick pics and we\u2019ve never done anything else (didn\u2019t fuck just made out) didn\u2019t want me to remove her from snap a while back, now I don\u2019t know what this most recent response means when I asked why were still taking.

There are a few people I am close with, who will not stop talking (interrupted or not) unless I indicate I need to be somewhere.\n\nFor example, I try to call my mom (58F) every few days but the monologues are putting me off. She literally talks for half an hour straight without me saying any word. Mostly about herself, her past, partner or her (religious) views which I find cool but do not share. For another family member (21F), whenever we meet, they tend to go through\/venting about all of their past experiences, analyzing every aspect of social situations from feelings to thoughts to how others perceive them with a range of hypothethical and often rhetorical what-if questions. It makes me feel conflicted, as they don't seem to want advice, but I also am not a therapist or such and don't want to make matters worse for them. They rarely ask me something, unless... it's about them. Don't get me wrong, I really don't mind listening but it would be nice having a two-way conversation at times.\n\nWhat might be contributing to my issue with them, is that I find they both generally take up a lot of space. My mom has very few people to talk to on a daily basis (also few daily activities or interests) and, as a single parent bringing up kids, has always been very reliant on me as the eldest. The other family member has been struggling with anxiety for some time. Both, they often ask me for help, favours or feedback about their behaviour or personality. I find it difficult to say no or to answer because if I do react negatively to such questions, they tend to feel personally rejected (even though I try to be very careful in my wording already because of this).\n\nI can't help that this often makes me feel 'used' or that they are not respecting my time nor space. On the other hand I feel incredibly guilty, because maybe I am just really selfish? By having someone talking for such a long time I just zone out eventually while actually I DO want to listen to them, ask questions and have a good time - as I truly care about them. I noticed I turn into a very quiet person, to provide them with the fewest cues to start off rambling. Although I would love to talk about how I have been doing or some things other than their view of themselves-others; like news, other interests like hobbies and places, food... However, lately I just try to avoid them in general because the thought of 'having to listen' for hours is conflicting me and makes me apprehensive of meeting them.\n\nAs I am re-reading all of this, I guess this partly might be me having to set boundaries and taking up my own space. But that's clearly....... not really my best talent. I really would like to get better at this, because this issue also arises at work with some of my co-workers, which has the practical consequence that I have less time to do my work. How do I improve with setting boundaries and turning conversations around? Or might there be something in my own behaviour that I am not seeing?\n\nOkay super long post, sorry about that and thank you anyway for reading this far.

She agreed to stop unless both of us were okay with the idea. Only when we were in the mood for it and only appropriate ages(above 18).\n\nShe said that part of why she was doing it to the extent she had been is because she thought I like it.

It became obvious in mid 2021 when we started seeing people again and she felt like no one liked her, she was boring, etc. After a few incidents, I told her she needed to see a therapist. She was diagnosed with social anxiety and given SSRIs (~Sept. 2021). They worked well until she broke her arm pretty badly. More isolation and stress and we were back to square 1 after a few months. At this point she stopped seeing her therapist (~April 2022). \n\nHer job was also stressful and we had lots of fights at that time.

A few weeks ago, she started crying loudly on a plane because I said I wanted to talk about some things when we got home (the conversation was brought up naturally but I did not want to to talk about it on a crowded plane). She is often stressed \/ avoidant of socially situations. She asked that I let her text our friend groups so that she is more involved but then won\u2019t do it or will do it late because of the social anxiety. It leads to confusion and frustration. These are just a few of many examples. \n\nI asked her to see a therapist again many months ago. She saw one for the first time 1+ month ago but it didn\u2019t work since they were out of state. Since then, she has looked some up but never contacted one. She always has some excuse as to why. To top it off, nicotine and marijuana abuse has been standard for the last two years. I smoke MJ to but much less frequently and not as a crutch.\n\nIm not sure what else to do. I love her but my patients is running thin. I feel like im often walking on egg shells not to offend her when Im naturally a very playful person (yes, sometimes to the point of being annoying but never intentionally mean). Its hard to build new relationships or maintain old ones when she feels socially isolated even around our mutual friends. She seems to know what she needs to do to feel better but doesnt have the will power to do it. Any tips? I know this is way harder for her but I feel like I\u2019m sinking with her.","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1678661509.0},{"title":"I (34F) needs hope that if I break up with long-term boyfriend (34M), that I still have time to find love and someone who wants kids.","author":"Ego_Mediator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11ph4b9\/i_34f_needs_hope_that_if_i_break_up_with_longterm\/","text":"Without laying the whole relationship out, I've been in a long term relationship for many years.

We went out for dinner last night. My previous relationship ended coming up on 6 years ago on the grounds of me being cheated on which has left me with significant trauma in the way that it occurred. My girlfriend did some volunteer work at her brother's bar Saturday night and offered to let me use her iPad as I was at her place that night and hadn't brought mine. As I was finishing up I noticed her exes name in her messages app, whom she had broken up with just a few months before me, and I open it to see that she had been messaging him around my birthday just over two weeks ago with the last messages being just a few days before. She was the one to initiate contact with him generally just asking what he had been up to, this then led onto her asking if she could see him as they live quite close to each-other, asking if she'd ever see him again, and apologising for how things ended with him. I can see from his replies that he declined to see her. I confronted her about this to which she responded that she didn't think she had to defend her privacy from me. She then proceeds to tell me that I don't know the full story of how they ended and that she broke his heart and always felt guilty for it. I somewhat accept this, we hug for a little while and we move on kind of.\n\nFlash forward to later in the evening, we stop near the park near her house, where she proceeds to give me the full picture of why she and her ex ended. She claims that towards the end they were both unhappy and that she ultimately cheated on him which caused the end of their relationship. She claims to have reached out to him out of guilt after hearing my story. She has apologised to me for this and says she regrets reaching out and knows she never should have messaged him. She blocked him shortly after. It is at this point she proceeds to cry and talk about how I deserve so much better than her and that I'm too good for this world. The conversation generalises about trust until we bring up a prior incident that occurred around two weeks ago, in which she claimed she was going on a walk with her father only for it to transpire that she had in fact gone on a walk alone and had admitted to lying to me. She then proceeds to reveal that this was too a lie and that she had in fact gone for a drive with a male friend who is also in a relationship. She then tells me that the male in question forced her to perform oral sex on him, threatening that if she didn't he would drive off a cliff. I try my best to see things from both ends with this. I let her know how angry I am that she lied to me and betrayed my trust, whilst also comforting her as this is rape(provided her story is true). I ask for the guys name which she didn't give me as she believes this will ruin this life. I say my piece and ask her what she would like me to do, she asks me to please not leave and to stay, but would understand if I didn't want to see her again, which I say I will. We walk back to her place and spend the rest of the evening watching tv somewhat silently. She's currently asleep in bed as I'm making this post. We have spoken this evening and have laid out some ground rules going forward. This was her idea as she says she's never known a love like mine before and that no-one has ever done the things for her that I have. She claims to be scared to death of losing me. I am at her beckon call more or less 24\/7 and spend most nights on facetime even while we sleep.\n\nI want to make peace with this so badly as I know our love is real, the realest I've ever known.

But is that actually possible?\n\nI met my wife almost three years ago - it was arranged by a friend of my stepmother, and obviously we hit it off - my family love her, and her family seemed to like me; we were married after a little over a year. About one month after our marriage, one of my new sisters-in-law became convinced that I was abusing my wife - she tried to convince my wife to leave me, then she sent me a text, ordering me to divorce her, or she would have me arrested.\n\nWe didn't think much of it, but less than twelve hours later there was a knock on the door - the police were there, along with an ambulance crew, and a social worker; my sister-in-law who lives in another country had a friend of hers file a police report that I had stabbed my wife, had a gun, and threatened to kill her. After talking to her in private, and the EMTs physically examined her, confirming I did nothing of the kind, the police asked me if I wanted to report any domestic abuse for my part(which I thought was nice)\n\nWhen I said no, the EMTs and social worker left, but the police said they needed us to come with them to the station - they said there was some bureacracy to handle. We went along with them unsuspecting anything, until we got there, hen she was told to sit in a waiting room, while I was taken to a jail cell and locked in. It turns out that by law, in this jurisdiction, the police need to respond to any reported domestic abuse(toward a woman) by immediately arresting the man, regardless of anything - proof, testimony, etc. none of it matters; the fact that my wife, the supposed victim, told them nothing happened didn't change it.\n\nI sat in that jail cell, listening to my wife crying and begging the police to let me come home with her for FIVE HOURS STRAIGHT. eventually, I was released, but only after signing a peace bond, being fingerprinted, and subjected to a restraining order that kept me away from my wife and home. Fortunately, we lived only a few minutes away from my sisters, so I had where to go; unfortunately, it is now on my permanent record that I was the chief suspect in a police investigation of a violent felony(that never happened) which lost me a job that I really wanted.\n\nIf all that sounds crazy, it was, but that was just the start of one long and wild ride.\n\nAs of now, we, and our relationship, have been investigated by (draw deep breath): the police, social welfare, several branches of local government, the national health ministry, US Embassy, the police(again) and the national anti-cult group.\n\n(I actually think there were one or two others, but I can't remember right now)\n\nMy wife's family all sided with the sister; I was expelled from the family WhatsApp group immediately after being arrested; at one point, the sister told my wife that I had been communicating secretly with her, that I wanted to have babies with her(all lies) and when my wife talked about this with her mother, my mother-in-law said that she knew about it, in advance, and then tried to justify it.\n\nAt a later point they tricked my wife to come home to them, then tried to trap her there, the mother stole all her money, and in an insane three-way phone call with myself and some cult expert in Spain, the father-in-law called me a child pornographer.\n\nTo be perfectly clear, I am NOT a child pornographer.\n\nAll of this insanity culminated In my mother-in-law suing in family court(funded by my sister-in-law) to have my wife declared mentally incompetent, and have herself(mother-in-law) declared her guardian. The entire thing was a shitshow from start to finish, a monumental waste of time and money, in large part because last year, the sister-in-law tried to get the national ministry of health to do the same thing, and failed.\n\nJust before we got the summons to the court case we met with some acquaintances of my wife and her family; a headshrinker and his wife who offered to serve as a go-between for communication - and after a great deal of thought, we had actually agreed to being open to communicating with them, just before I got the summons telling me I had to go to court and fight for my wife not be declared legally a child.\n\nThere was one little bright spot of sanity, however - the father-in-law, apparently realising how insane all this was, wrote a rebuttal to his wife's claims, and actually offered to pay for a lawyer for us(it wasn't necessary to retain one, fortunately). Now he wants her to come back again, offering to pay for her flight, for a hotel, for a rental car, just to see her again. My wife's grandmother(who was kept out of the whole thing) is dying, and my wife wants to see her again; after thought and discussion, we have agreed to come, together, to at least meet with him. The mother-in-law wants to come, too; my wife says she needs to apologise first, which she so far refuses to do, though father-in-law is hopeful he can convince her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo again, I ask you, dear Redditors: I never knew my extended family, and missed out on a lot that I regret, so if it's possible for my children to know their extended family, I'm willing to go pretty far to see it through.

I'm not saying i haven't made mistakes, but we're able to communicate and talk stuff through most of the time. \n\na week ago, these two aspects of her collided into a very bad night. at first everything was great, until i saw my friends were online. i told her I'd say hi to them for and talk for a few mins before getting watching a movie with her. she got very upset at this, which made her feel guilty about herself, which started a very negative train of thought, which ending up leading to a manic episode. it was incredibly emotionally distressing as i didn't know what to do and i became terrified due to how she was acting, i thought i might have to call a ambulance or something. she also brought up she might do things to herself which i will not say here due to TW.  after i knew she was okay, i made her sign up for therapy (something she's wanted to do but was too scared to) since the problem had escalated to a point where she was scared of herself. \n\nto skip a few details, i am now terrified to ask for space. a few days ago i asked if she could go back to her place just for a few hours, but she said \"i really don't want to\" and i could feel another episode coming so i let her stay to avoid it. i don't know how handle it and I'm really scared of her falling into another episode and potentially hurting herself, but i am also getting very exhausted. i tried to talk to her today and say that i may be more upfront from now on because it's much healthier for the both of us, but she's left me on read and I'm not sure when she'll respond.\n\nhow do I now set this boundary with her? I'm not sure what to do. i don't want her to do things to herself and i also still want to be with her, just more healthy \n\nTLDR: My gf is extremely attached to me and will have a very bad episode if i tried to ask for some space. but i need this space due to my introvertedness. \n\nI'm not the best writer so apologizes if this feels scatterbrained.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678671570.0},{"title":"My (24M) ever first relationship with a girl (24F) traumatized me.

I met my wife \\[42\\] in 2002 and we married in 2007. The other night I had to confess to her (at my therapists urging) that I am extremely unhappy and that I have been for quite a long time. I have asked that we attend marriage counselling to try to save the marriage but she isn't totally receptive to that idea, fearing she will get the blame. \n\n*Some background.* The past year or so I've been dealing with the effects of stress . Doctor has given me a clean bill of health, physically at least. It came to a point about 6 weeks ago when I requested the help of the employee assistance section in work, as I was afraid my performance was going to be compromised. I've had a number of therapy sessions in the weeks since.\n\nI went to the therapist thinking that I knew the cause of the stress. My son \\[10\\] has been having some behavioural issues the past couple of years that has been extremely draining, painful and a cause of stress in the home. Over the course of a couple of sessions, it became clear to me that I've been expertly burying a lot of painful feelings and issues for the past 10 years or so. All of these buried emotions are now bubbling to the surface and it hasn't been good. At all. I can very quickly summarise these issues;\n\n1. When we first met, she refused to have sex. This comes from a religious upbringing. It would all be different after we married she promised.\n2. We married in 2007 but it wasn't until 2009 we had sex and that was only after specialist counselling. Our sex life since has been very unfulfilling. I'd say last year we had sex about 3 or 4 times.\n3. After my mother died 2011, I discovered that my dad had even more affairs than I knew of and more children than I knew. I stopped communicating with him but he has never reached out in that time. Now, maybe I might not have been receptive to him but now I realise it has caused me pain that he never even tried. \n4. Our house had pyrite rendering it valueless and falling apart structurally. After years of fighting with the government, I did get this redressed but it was years of me seemingly fighting this on my own. Very little support from my wife, who was happy to let me get on with it. \n5. I had hip surgery in 2013 to rectify hip impingement. A birth condition I was unaware of until it started causing pain. Since 2013, I've lived with chronic pain since due to arthritis of the hip. As you can imagine, this just drains you physically after a while. Silently though, as I honestly try my best never to complain about it. \n6. The aforementioned behavioural issues of my son. \n\nSince unpacking all that with the therapist I've been feeling incredibly low and emotional. I would consider myself someone who doesn't show emotion easily but the past few months I'm breaking down in front of people, but not my wife for some reason. \n\nI believe the biggest issue out of this is that I have a lot of anger towards my wife for those years without sex. I hope that doesn't sound too... shallow. I mean we were both young, it should have been a time of excitement and exploration. A time neither of us will ever get back. I don't know how to process this anger. All I know is that now, it refuses to stay buried. \n\nI can say those years changed me. I'm not an affectionate person, but that wasn't the case before. It's a defense mechanism according to the therapist. I put myself out there for so long, only to be rejected time and again and now I'm just protecting myself. I do yearn for a closeness that I see in some of our friends relationships but that is totally absent, and I get the blame for that from my wife. But why should I look for affection from the person who has hurt me so much. \n\nDivorce really isn't a practical option here (Ireland). Basically divorce would boil down to one of the two of us ending up homeless and in 99.9% of cases that will mean the male. And that doesn't seem like an equitable solution to me. \n\nAs to the inevitable question as to why I put up with it in the beginning, I don't know what to say. That was a tough question from the therapist too. Honestly, it is probably from a feeling a lack of self esteem \/ worth. \n\n**Questions**. What options am I left with, counselling wise? How does one deal with this kind of anger and resentment? \n\n# TLDR\n\nAttending therapist to tackle stress and unpacked a lot of unresolved issues over past decade or so. Feeling extremely unhappy, angry and with a growing sense resentment towards my wife. Main issue being her not wanting to have sex for many years. How do I deal with these feelings? Should I be looking for a specific type of marriage counselling?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678662303.0},{"title":"GF (20 F) texting ex even though I (20 M) said I\u2019m not okay with it.","author":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11pqg2u\/gf_20_f_texting_ex_even_though_i_20_m_said_im_not\/","text":"My gf has an ex who each time she leaves him he calls\/texts her mom and star 69 calls her trying to get back etc and we made the deal just to block and ignore him even though her mom won\u2019t.\n\nBut at 5am this morning she got a call from a non id and didn\u2019t answer later on she tells me that he texted her mom and her mom called her saying to text him and not tell me. \n\nSo she added him back on snap and said hi which she wasn\u2019t going to tell me about but ended up telling me her ex added her. \n\nI think she wasn\u2019t going to tell me though because she set a timer passcode on her snap and insta so you have to use a code to open it, she said it\u2019s just a coincidence that she wanted to use it less but idk. \n\nAnyways this ex was her very first bf that she actually has left twice and gotten back together one time even leaving a bf for him. \n\nWe made the agreement that since he always try\u2019s calling etc to just ignore and block but now she\u2019s saying she wants to catch up with him and text. \n\nThis really hurt me and I told her no since she\u2019s told me all the toxic things he did and how he cheated and he was her 1st etc and pressured stuff. \n\nMe telling her I\u2019m not comfortable with it and I\u2019m not gonna have her doing that made her very mad and yell at me and storm off.

We are in a long-distance relationship for most of the year as we are both in school, but have summer (3 months) and winter break to see each other.\n\nWe really clicked with each other from the start, we have similar senses of humor, similar interests\/hobbies, and similar life goals. We talk every day during the school day, and then call\/play games together all evening\/night. She is really great, we laugh together and get each other, and have talked a lot about our future together. When we hang out in person when we both are home, we have an amazing time together and I wouldn't trade it for the world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever over the last year or so, when we have an argument, she has gotten a lot more difficult to resolve things with. She has become more and more in the mindset of \"I'm right, you're wrong\", and if I disagree with her, she just tells me that I'm \"not listening\" or I'm \"defending myself\", and gets mad at me for that. She almost never apologizes for anything, and she doesn't acknowledge that she does anything wrong.\n\nAbout 85% of the time, she will get mad at me no matter the issue, and wait for me to apologize and take the blame for everything, and then make her feel better. The other 15% of the time she takes all the blame on herself and gets very sad and depressed about it.\n\nAbout 6 months ago I brought this up with her and told her that I just want her to work on not going from 0 to 100 and instead just talking about our issues and trying to acknowledge my side.

I\u2019m 21, S\/O is 22. I\u2019ll be me, and S\/O will be Ann. I met Ann in college, became friends and a year later started dating. Coming up on three years this summer, and I love them. They are the love of my life, but I\u2019m asexual and autistic and I worry that it\u2019s platonic love. I don\u2019t know how to tell the difference to start, I\u2019m touch repulsed so no kissing\/anything intimate. I cant even hug sometimes because I hate touch, no cuddling, no NSFW stuff, etc. Ann is SUPER into ALL of that, and I can\u2019t find a balance where we are both happy, because I\u2019m always uncomfortable at kissing or anything more or similar, while they\u2019re sad at not having any of that. \nAnother problem I\u2019m having is I can\u2019t tell if I should break up with Ann. I cant imagine them not in my life, but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m healthy enough for a relationship. My mental health has been in the gutter since I had childhood trauma, and I\u2019ve never truly been okay since. Even after 12 years of therapy. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever been strong enough for one, and if I break up with Ann? I\u2019m done with relationships. I cant handle the stress of them, and thinking about another\u2019s feelings is hard for me. I\u2019m selfish. I know. It\u2019s who I am, and I don\u2019t feel strong enough to change. We\u2019re starting couples therapy once we get into this place that specializes in both of our mental health problems. (Also I am starting therapy with a new therapist soon for my self only) I have a slough of them, and they have OCD primarily. Well part of their OCD, is obviously, obsession. I don\u2019t feel like I can talk to them because when I tell them, they obsess over it. Bring it up, again, again, and AGAIN. Which leads me to feel like it\u2019s never solved, even when they say it is. One symptom of autism I suffer from, is taking things as they are, in basic terms. Anytime they bring it back up, I assume it\u2019s a problem again, even if they say it\u2019s not. I cant battle my brain like this. One super niche weird problem we have, is I LOVE fictional characters. Like saying \u201c___ is my wife.\u201d Or something like \u201cI love ___\u201d and then Ann gets hurt being like, I\u2019m your wife?? I thought it was playful, but they really get hurt by this. And I am sad that I have to hide my love for these characters that are coping characters for me, and it\u2019s just stupid to fight over. But then when I don\u2019t talk about them, Ann gets sad, saying I\u2019m hiding stuff I love from them. It\u2019s frustrating. I feel like I can\u2019t win, in those situations. \nAnn also is looking at leaving to school this winter, the only school to so far accept her is across the country. My job does not allow much time off, and I have very limited funds. So when Ann said they move there, I was straight up in saying I may not be able to visit. Maybe once? But it\u2019d take a lot of saving and trying to get time off and stuff. Ann said they didn\u2019t wanna be the only one putting in effort to see each other, and I get that! I broke up with my ex because he did not put in effort to spend time with me when we lived 15 minutes apart. But cross country when I have a strict job and limited funds? Am I the asshole for saying I may not be able to visit?? I feel like I\u2019m losing my mind. They said they wouldn\u2019t fly back during breaks because their mom is moving out of our state soon. So they aren\u2019t going to come here and are still upset at me for not coming to them. I feel like we can\u2019t find a compromise. \nIt\u2019s gotten to the point that I dread talking to Ann, I don\u2019t know what to do. I just feel resentment. (Also to add more context, irritation is a HUGE symptom of mine. Like if I\u2019m in a bad mental state like I am right now, everything irritates me. Even my dogs, who are my EVERYTHING. So idk if that\u2019s why I feel contempt towards her? Or if it\u2019s not just mental health stuff) Are we past help? We also had our first real fight back in December, the only time we ever raised our voices at each other and cussed at each other. Ann wants to get married and move in together and the thoughts makes me sick. I think I know what I need. But I don\u2019t wanna lose Ann at the same time. Please. I feel helpless. I also don\u2019t wanna hurt Ann, she is very sensitive and if we broke up I don\u2019t know if she could recover. We talked about some of this last night and she got distraught at the idea of us breaking up, i know I know, her mental health is not my responsibility. But i care about her, a lot, and I would feel guiltily still. \n\nTL;DR: I feel resentment in my relationship and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just because I am in a bad mental state.

My husband agrees. Six months ago he started dating this new girl, that we just met yesterday. I was happy to hear that he found someone. She is very educated and smart, according to him. They have similar personalities and interest. Considering my middle is kind of a nerd, that made me very happy to hear. Anyway I wanted to meet her immediately. My son said that she is very shy and it would take her time. Six months later she told him that she is ready to meet us. So Friday afternoon, my husband decides to grill. Everyone comes over. Then my son and his new girlfriends show up.\n\nThis beautiful girls walks in holding his hand and standing behind him. He was right, she is very shy. We all introduce are self and we will call her Sadie. Sadie was quiet but sad hi to everyone. She honestly associated the most with our dog that night. My sons go out and help their dad cook. My daughter-in-law goes out with my grandbaby, and soon to be daughter-in-law and her are best friends to they go out together. I ask if Sadie would like to help me finish the sides and chop some stuff. She says sure. I just ask how they met and typical conversations. Eventually my middle comes in and comes up behind her pokes her booty. She gives him a \"really\" look and hits in the arm and he grabs her and pick her up as they laugh. I say put her down don't be so rough on her. My son just says okay put her down and goes back out. I said, \"sorry, three boys. Sometimes they are little too rough, but he is harmless\". She said, \"I know he is. I used to wrestle with my dad and brother growing up too\". I said, \"your mom let her her daughter wrestle her older brother and dad? She said, \"well I used to be a boy so I guess it was different\" and giggled. I froze. I said, WHAT?. Her face went snow white and immediate tears rolled down her face. She said, \"he didn't tell you?\". I went no. She said, I think I should leave, I am sorry. I grabbed her and said no, stay here. I said \"does my son know\". She said yes he knows. She then said, I always bring it up first date so if there are issues, we don't waste each others time.\n\nTo be honest, I am very surprised, but my son has never been so happy so I dropped it. I honestly just couldn't believe it. I mean you would never know. She is gorgeous. She asked if I though of her different. I said that you make my son happy and as long as you treat him right I wont care. She just said thank you. I called my son today because his dad wants to get to know her more and wants to go to dinner with just them and us. He said sure. I brought up our conversation and he said he knows. He said that she is just really shy about it doesn't talk about it at all. She just try to run under the radar. He said that since you know we need to tell dad, but they discussed me kind of pre-telling my husband. Before tomorrow evening.\n\nAny idea on how, or should I tell my son before we go that he and her are going to have to do it?\n\nAny help would greatly appreciated, thank you.","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1678585849.0},{"title":"My partner (32F) is upset that I (25m) said she was being inconsiderate","author":"Alarmed_Sorbet8101","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11puptm\/my_partner_32f_is_upset_that_i_25m_said_she_was\/","text":"My partner (32F) and I (25M) have been together for 1 year, and we're discussing marriage as a possibility for the future.

For some back story : I have been cheated on 3 times from 3 separate relationships - she knows this. We got into an argument on Friday night (topic was really stupid like usual). She ended up telling me not to talk to her ever again and blocked me. I messaged her saying we\u2019re done and that was it. The next day (Saturday night) she went out with her friends after telling them we broke up. She told me today that she\u2019s sorry for everything she\u2019s ever done and was being very apologetic. I went over to her house to try and fix the issue and she ended up telling me that while she was blacked out the night before a guy would not leave her alone the whole night and her friends wouldn\u2019t help her get rid of him. She told me in her blacked out state, he grabbed her face forcefully and started kissing her, but she can\u2019t remember if she kissed him back. I am beyond furious and want to end it for good. I have abandonment issues (obviously from past relationships) and this would be extra hard for me as I really don\u2019t have any friends other than her.

TLDR at the bottom\n\nMy wife(f33) and I (m32) have been together since I was 15 and she was 16. We have been married for 11 years and have two kids together. My mother and I have never had a good relationship. She is a bit of a narcissist and can be extremely manipulative. I have five siblings and I am the only who still speaks with her. I grew up very poor and my wife grew up in a middle\/upper-middle class family. Because of this there is obvious jealousy and inferiority issues from my mother and my wife tolerates a lot of passive aggressive comments. When I was 17 my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, in 2019 it came back as stage 4. \n\nIn our adult lives we have done well for ourselves. My wife and I both work very hard and got good jobs early. We have been smart with our money and have been able to afford a large home with 4 bedrooms. I would drive my mother to her monthly appointments and talk with her doctors. One day last summer I took her to an appointment and she had gotten down to 95lbs with large legions in her femur and would need a stabilizing rod inserted. I took her grocery shopping and then home. I helped her inside with the groceries, which I usually would not go into her apartment. There were roaches freely walking around the counters and furniture, the house reeked of dog urine and there was thick dust on everything. I decided that she could not die there. My wife very reluctantly offered for her to move in to our large downstairs bedroom that has a bathroom adjacent to it. \n\nWe paid her rent for the remainder of the lease and then moved her in with us after she left the hospital to have the rod installed. We do not require her to contribute to the house at all. We ask that she maintains her room and restroom but we do not ask for money for rent, utilities or food. \n\nFast forward a year and she has gained 40lbs and overall seems to be much healthier. My wife however is not. In the last 18 months she has had a large cystectomy, an emergency hysterectomy and two large desmoid tumors removed. My mother has made recovery hell. She has been loud, needy and unsupportive. She makes comments and takes pot shots when I\u2019m not home but hides in her room when I am. She interjects or will openly second guess us when it comes to disciplining our children. My wife is a wonderfully sweet and supportive woman who will always sacrifice her needs to help others. Which makes her an easy target and doormat for my mother. Now I see my wife do spiteful things or purposely exclude my mother from things as an intentional slight. This is not who she is. And it\u2019s gotten to a point that I can no longer sacrifice the mental health of the mother of my children and my best friend for another person.  \n\nIn my heart I know that she needs to go. But I am having a very difficult time reconciling with the fact that I am going to kick out my dying mother. My loyalty is to my wife as I believe it should be but I cannot stomach the idea of making my mother homeless. Furthermore, I\u2019m worried that I will develop a resentment towards my wife if I am able to kick her out and the inevitable happens at what seems sooner than what it should have. \n\nI also don\u2019t have anywhere to turn. My wife has been my best friend since high school but is way too emotionally invested for an unbiased conversation, I don\u2019t really have any friends outside of work and I am the boss so it is not appropriate to discuss this with employees anyways. I feel like I\u2019m on a shitty, lonely island. Even my siblings. Two moved thousands of miles away, one fell off the face of the earth when he turned 18, another can\u2019t even speak to or about my mother without having a breakdown and the last is busy being a 21 year old kid. \n\nTLDR; I have to kick out my dying mother for the sake of my marriage and my wife\u2019s mental health but don\u2019t have the backbone.","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1678652409.0},{"title":"I, 24F don't want my boyfriend 25M dogs in the bed.

I am very happy, and we have a great relationship for the most part. Jake has 2 dogs. They are large (60lbs) mutts. We have been talking for the past few months about moving in with each other when our leases are up (Octoberish). We spend almost every night together. We rotate between houses. My boyfriend has always slept with his dogs. Him and his ex slept with the dogs. And when I stay at his place, I also sleep with the dogs (which is fine. It is his place, his rules). However, every time I stay in there in his bed, my allergies act up. Like really bad (hard to breathe, eyes watering, sneezing, itching). Like to the point where my claritin or allegra stopped working. So I went to see the allergist. Turns out, I'm incredibly allergic to grass and dirt. Somewhat allergic to dogs and cats, but mostly grass and dirt. I bought some new allergy meds which help somewhat. But I am much more uncomfortable staying in his bed than I am my own bed (my cats do not bother my allergies). I set a boundary early on when we were talking about moving in together that I do not want any dogs on MY bed. I want my bed to be a place where i can relax without having to worry about my allergies acting up. Jake got incredibly defensive, upset (as he is VERY attached to his dogs), and said that \"there should just be no animals, cats or dogs in the bedroom\" to which i reluctantly agreed. However, I have been thinking recently and I don't agree with that. I spoke to him about it, and I have given him several different options, like 1) the dogs can sleep on a dog bed next to our bed. 2) the dogs can sleep in the crate in our room. 3) you can move your own bed into our place and we can sleep with the dogs sometimes. To which he always makes an excuse on how that will not work. He says the only fair option is no pets in the bedroom. However, I cannot imagine kicking my cats out of the bedroom. I am willing to only sleep with them sometimes, but never seems a bit much. My cat is very anxious, and I know she will have a hard time adjusting to two dogs in her space. Our plan was to keep the dogs downstairs and cats upstairs when we first move in while they get acquainted. I just can't imagine coming home from a long day at work and my kitty missing me and wanting to snuggle and me shutting the door in her face. Like I said I am more than willing to work with him, but he literally keeps saying \"Me not sleeping with the pups is a HUGE thing. I understand them not being in the bed is bad for your health but to me its the most fair to just have no animals in the bedroom.\" He also keeps saying \"I've slept with my dogs for the past 5 years, and you've only had your cats 1 year so its much less of a sacrifice for you.\" I just feel like he is punishing me, and trying to be fair to his dogs but not me. I'm incredibly upset, and not sure what to do. Any advice is appreciated.

We are both undergrads that are graduating in May, and we both have great job offers lined up but the pressure to not screw up is putting a tremendous amount of stress on our relationship.  \nFirst I'll go over why I fear intimacy and then I'll cover the fight\n\n**Fear of Intimacy**\n\nI have gone through my entire life up to this point hardly ever sharing my feelings with anyone, and telling myself I am simply unemotional and I don't need help from anyone ever. This is actually my first post asking anyone for personal advice because it's reached the point where I feel like me and my girlfriend live in two different realities.\n\nI recently realized that I have been in denial about the fact that I had a messed up childhood which has led to a deep fear of intimacy. Nobody in my family ever talked about their feelings. My parents resented each other and got divorced but not like anyone else I know, they still lived with each other for a while and still interact with each other frequently for the sake of keeping the family together even though they don't love each other. I have never felt safe sharing my feelings with my family. My brother has Aspergers so that made it difficult for us to connect emotionally but we are still closer than I am to my parents.\n\nI think my fear of intimacy developed when I was in high school, or at least was made worse. I made a satirical Twitter account in high school where I posted a picture with the acceptable use policy along with an image that violated every part of it. It was an anonymous account so someone who knew me must have reported me. The school administration saw a crudely photoshopped image of a fake gun with a bottle of Jack Daniels in the magazine shooting a syringe at the high school and used that as the grounds to expel me for making \"terrorist threats\". It was obvious to me they were making an example out of me because of the new laptops but my parents enthusiastically complied with them. They took me to get psychoanalyzed against my will like some kind of a school shooter. They demonstrated exceptional listening skills as the school administration covered screenshots of the post in a vacuum devoid of any nuance or satire where everything is reduced to its most basic, literal, and negative form. They nodded their heads, asked clarifying questions, summarized and paraphrased their points, and showed empathy for what the administrators had to deal with. Nothing they ever would afford me. They would shoot me a glare and shut me down If I tried to explain myself. The punishment was cutting me off from my computer. I was pretty addicted to video games at the time, combine that with being socially isolated since I was expelled, and I entered a bottomless pit of despair, loneliness, and addiction that I only escaped from in college.  I really had nothing. I filled the void by reading dystopian novels and learning to hate the world and adopt an incredibly cynical worldview. My mom has been cagy about guns my entire life and I made this connection while writing this. It made me wonder if she always was scared I was some kind of monster. It's painful to think about but it's also plausible because I was always the problem child, but always to get attention and approval from my peers, never to cause pain, and the times where I did cause pain to other people I sincerely regret. But after the expulsion I wasn't the same. I went back to my old school after a year. But I wasn't the class clown anymore who is secretly intelligent but has low self-esteem and uses humor to get validation. I was the dejected loner who feels disconnected from everyone around them. I neglected my friendships and became a reclusive truant that sleeps during the day and tweaks at night on my prescription Amphetamines. I let late assignments pile up, i was completely burned out and unable to keep up with the workload from AP classes, and the backlog quickly was so intimidating progress felt impossible and I fell into the vicious cycle of procrastinating by watching self-help content and productivity hacks. But I never could figure out what was wrong with me. I think at one point I even asked my mom for help with my mental health but her response was basically what the hell am I supposed to do about it? She did make me go to a school-appointed therapist that basically just lectured me about why being disruptive is bad. She took me to this coach-type person that made me fill out a planner, but it wasn't helpful. My dad has been physically present but emotionally absent my entire life just like his dad was. I got my revenge on the school with a capstone presentation similar to Sam Hyde's 2070 paradigm shift that made a disgrace of the program and called their bluff on the fact they would let me graduate no matter what I presented on that my dad filmed (without knowing what my plan was) and put on Youtube. The school and even my dad thought it was very funny, even though it embarrassed me to watch. The retribution actually felt amazing and put the wind in my sail to make the changes I needed to like quitting stimulants. My mom convinced me to go to college rather than learn to code by myself which was the best decision I ever made, and I really blossomed into a very confident adult in school, where I met my girlfriend.   \nHowever, I never really processed these feelings or tried to reconcile what happened with my parents, I have always just avoided it and bottled it up until now when I have to reflect on why I am the way I am because of my relationship problems. I feel like part of why I'm such an overachiever now is because I feel the need to prove to the world that I'm normal. It's probably why I love politics, arguing, debating, and I feel the need to constantly over-explain myself to defend my beliefs or actions in order to not be misunderstood and feel in control.\n\nAll this emotional baggage makes it very hard for me to enforce boundaries with my girlfriend or hold her accountable for hurting my feelings. We recently have both been accusing the other of being abusive, manipulative, gaslighting, narcissistic, etc. I can't figure out if I'm just sabotaging the relationship because of my fear of intimacy or if she is disrespecting my boundaries and it's actually justified for me to be upset.  \n**The fight**\n\nI started sending my girlfriend some of my thoughts about a theory about how modern culture kind of hates humanity and there's an attitude that humans are so corrupt and greedy and life is so full of suffering that it would be better to annihilate humanity and that's represented by the statement that there are too many people on earth which has genocidal undertones. Instead of saying that she didn't care she just offered minimal responses and follow-up questions that showed she didn't actually understand what I was trying to convey but she was pretending like she was interested to be polite, and she also constantly tried to change the subject, said I'm being moody and she hates when I'm moody. Her responses were very minimal but my explanations were in-depth so it would be way too long to provide the entire conversation. Here are her messages from the start in order and contiguous (I tried my best not to cherry-pick)  \n\"Yeah i agree, i don't know if I should have kids in this world.\n\nWait so you think what a collapsing society needs is to put our kids in the way?\n\nThat's like people who have kids in the last of us.\n\nYou love making baseless claims.\n\n\\*4 different messages attempting to change the subject, a golf analogy that demonstrates surface level engagement, 2 more attempts to change the subject\\*\n\nYou're so moody today\n\nIts just this feels intuitive\n\nI don't feel like you need to read a book to know that life is cruel\n\nOverpopulation is something that I've learn about fairly often when I was an environmental science major\n\nYou're making an astute observation but you're not the first, and I have literally said that shit to you ab abortion before\n\nI can't beleive you just wake up hungover in these moods\n\nThat's a convoluted way of looking at it\n\nEthics are determined by the person\n\nYou're wishy-washy\" \n\nIt felt like she was being dismissive because she wasn't interested but she was pretending to be so her resentment manifested itself in these passive-aggressive responses. So I just called her out and said if you aren't interested just tell me you aren't interested, don't pretend. She got upset when I told her that because she introduced a new vague boundary about how I'm not allowed to \"tell her how she feels\" which she uses inappropriately when I'm actually just trying to explain why she hurt my feelings. She also set a boundary about how I cannot \"start arguments over text\", even though on the phone or in person it feels to me like she is very bad about interrupting and monopolizing the conversations and being argumentative, aggressively straw-manning, and pushing my buttons in general to the point where I'm screaming at her so she can't interrupt me anymore, after which she will play the victim and say she can't believe she's still dating a monster who would yell at her like that. Any time I accuse her of anything she ends up accusing me of doing the same thing but worse. She may have interrupted and ranted at me, but at least she didn't yell. It feels like any time I do something hurtful to her, she does it back to me. If I say I can't stay in this relationship much longer because I constantly feel inadequate and like I can't do anything right, she says she's even closer to leaving me. I tell her that I am enjoying the space over spring break, she tells me she's enjoying the space even more. I said I felt like she depended on me for emotional support and she said she doesn't need me and she can live without me even though all her self-pity sympathy-seeking behavior demonstrates the opposite. One of the things that gaslights me is that her memory of past disagreements feels incredibly warped and it makes me question my own memory, any time she remembers something I said in the past it's incredibly one-sided, black and white, and lacks all nuance, which is why I like having these conversations over text because it can't be reinterpreted and warped later. It's the only medium where I feel like I can actually explain myself or air out my thoughts, but I also need to put my phone on airplane mode when I'm trying to gather my thoughts because she's like a little chihuahua nipping at my heels. She will skim the message, strawman it into a mischaracterized version, and dismiss it in under a second. It's even faster on the phone or in person. And she's telling me that she's the one who feels unheard, even though I spent 2 and a half hours going through every message of the argument she sent me and explaining why it felt dismissive and hurtful. When I took my phone off airplane mode and the reflection of the conversation sent, she refused to read it because of her boundary about not arguing over text. Instead, she called me and yelled at me and I actually was looking at the time on the phone. She went on a judgemental rant about how my behavior was not ok and that I ruined her day because it was her last day of spring break and she wanted to enjoy it with her family and instead I ruined it by making a big deal out of nothing until the 2-minute mark. I tried to explain myself until 2:05 when she interrupted me to continue her judgemental rant. I hung up because I don't deserve to be spoken to like that. She called me immediately after and said how dare I hang up on her. I feel like she weaponizes boundaries because she set a boundary about not being able to hang up on her.   \nAs I'm typing this she's brainstorming excuses for us to see each other even though I said I need time to process this and forgive her. It's so easy because we are on such a small campus you can walk anywhere in 6 minutes and to her room in one minute. I feel suffocated and like I can't escape from her. She will find me, look at me as tears well up and she demands to know how I could be such a monster to hurt her so badly by asking for space. It just shows a lack of willingness to ever respect my boundaries. It's especially disrespectful because after previous arguments the conclusion we came to was that I need to do a better job setting boundaries. Yet, she has threatened to break up with me about 20 times today as a result of me sticking to my guns about my space. She also threatened to kill herself when I threatened to leave once in the past which is how I remind myself that I'm not actually a monster and these are manipulative threats. Right now she's saying she needs a toothbrush, she needs an estimate of when we will talk again, she's calling me and blowing up my Snapchat. I just feel like this is hopeless. I feel like she will never respect my boundaries, take accountability, or be aware of her manipulative tendencies. She's only comfortable with boundaries and changes if they are her boundaries and I'm the one who's changing. She constantly acts like I'm not putting enough effort into the relationship which causes me to feel like I'm never good enough. She constantly asks me if I love her or not. In the past, she used to say 'fibs' after I would say yes until I called her out for this. This relationship makes me feel exhausted, guilty, and inadequate. The only reason I'm willing to tolerate this is that this relationship has made me grow a lot as a person. But I'm not even sure if it was the relationship that made me grow or if that was just college. After becoming aware of how manipulative she is I'm wondering if I'm just internalizing her lies. All this reflection has led to more questions. For example, now I'm questioning my identity because of the realization of the impact my parents' betrayal had on me. Am I like this just because of what my parents did to me? And does my girlfriend even like me for who I am or is she just using me for emotional support? After all, she didn't give a shit about my philosophical ideas. She kept saying she misses me and should she shave which means \"are we having sex tonight?\". She constantly tells me I don't show her affection enough and she complains about how every single thing in her life is a struggle. She uses self-pity to try and elicit emotional support from me. We only ever hear about her problems. When I'm complaining it feels like she loses respect for me for being weak and she is incredibly impatient. For example, during erg week for rowing with 10 hard indoor workouts in one week, I told her to give me space for the week because I will be on edge. She would find an excuse to get near me, then start playing the victim and calling me a monster because the way I breathed and the tone of my voice was mean. She said she would give me space and then she's just coming up with 3 excuses to bother me in an hour. I wonder if it's because that's the only purpose I serve for her. To fulfill her emotional needs, and nothing more. I tell her I don't care to look at her camera roll of her family for the same reason she doesn't care when I show her a video of my cat, I would rather have you just say you don't care instead of building up resentment and acting passive-aggressive. She acts like I just broke her heart by not pretending to care about the undeniably boring minutiae she subjects me to. I know it probably sounds like I just don't like her but she's actually one of the funniest girls I know sometimes and can be very entertaining. When she is boring it almost feels like it's a game or a test. She will interrupt a joke setup on a tv show I'm invested in to tell me how many meetings she set at work today, then be visibly irritated when I say \"cool\" and rewind the show back to the part she interrupted. She proceeds to call me a piece of shit who isn't supportive of her career choices. I feel like she knows exactly how to put me in a situation that causes me to act in a way that makes me look like an asshole. Every fight feels disorienting because I feel like it started with me trying to explain why something she does bothers to be, but by the end, I'm the one apologizing because the way I tried to explain myself was actually \"incredibly abusive and violated all her boundaries\". It's causing me to question reality. I know all these are huge red flags but she is my best friend and I don't want to leave her unless there is no other option. She claims she's willing to work on the relationship and actually she insists she's the one putting the most effort into working on herself right now but given her behavior I just don't believe her, I think she's just saying that to appease me and she's playing the long game because she knows eventually I will just let this slide because I never hold my ground for very long since she makes it so exhausting.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678678520.0},{"title":"How often do you see your bf\/gf at the year mark? 34 F and 26 F","author":"unopenedvessel","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11pyyxo\/how_often_do_you_see_your_bfgf_at_the_year_mark\/","text":"My girlfriend (34 f) and I (26 f) have been seeing each other for a year now.

Met a girl almost a year ago (23 F) and began dating her. Most of my friends are a few I made while in college and a majority from high school. Not having many Women friends isn\u2019t by choice, but by circumstance. Here\u2019s a couple reasons.  \n\n1. I live at home and have been searching for a job, so my interactions with women have been scarce. Girlfriend, mom, and that\u2019s about it. \n2. I don\u2019t have a job. Meeting people through work as an adult is the best way to make friends (so I\u2019ve heard). \n3. I\u2019m usually a really shy guy. I treat random men and women the same when it comes to interactions in public. This includes me minding my own business. \n4. I simply get along better with guys when it comes to hanging out. Now I can say I have \u201cfriends\u201d that are girls but the connection hasn\u2019t really stuck with any that I\u2019ve met. I don\u2019t keep snap streaks nor do I text constantly so maintaining those friendships can be difficult.   \n\nWhat my GF said truly hurt my feelings. I feel as if it was uncalled for and over stepping a boundary. I believe she could have approached me with words such as \u201cit could be beneficial\u201d or \u201ccan I make a suggestion\u201d. I told her I decide who my friends are not her. When I find a job maybe I will make friends that are women. I am completely open to the idea.  After GF told me I only view women as sexual objects; I told her she needs to mind her own business and stay in \u201cher own lane\u201d. \n\nNow I get how this can be rude to say but I was seriously hurt by her words. She was incredibly offended by me telling her that and basically ghosted me for a day and a half. Now she asked to have the week to herself of no contact.  \n\nI am simply a little lost and hurt.

He has not been unfaithful (he claims) but he lies a lot to me about sillly random things over the yrs. When we first met he wanted marriage and kids but then we discovered he had a genetic issue and cannot conceive. He refused to adopt or use a perm donor so we knew expanding a family was a mute point about 3yrs into the relationship. He also got me an engagement ring and gave it to me after a fight and that was 6 yrs ago\u2026 he also banished me and isolated me from his entire extended family after a misunderstanding with his sister In law 5 yrs ago and leaves me evey Sunday to have family dinners with his parents and brothers and their families.

I\u2019ve cried a lot over the period of the relationship and begged him to change and stop isolating me and grow together as a team but he shows me the door and reminds me if I\u2019m not happy with things the way they are then leave because he isn\u2019t forcing me to stay.

Also - family is very important to me because I\u2019m an orphan and have no family left except for my daughters.

I know that by telling her this will be the end of our marriage. She will not forgive me, there will be no talking through it. She will tell me to pack my bags and leave immediately. I can't live with the guilt of not telling her, but I can't live without her. I don't know what to do.\n\nBasically, my wife and I always wanted a traditional family. I would go to work and she would stay home with the kids. We both always wanted a large family, a house in the suburbs, a dog, the whole thing. We got married when she was 19 and I was 23. She got pregnant right away and our first son was born nine months to the day after our wedding. He was such an easy, happy baby. We were all so happy. My wife was super passionate about cooking, arts and crafts and home decor. Our home was always spotless, despite having a baby and dog. We had a great marriage and a healthy sex life. We were both naive enough to think that being parents was always going to be easy. \n\nWe started trying for another as soon as the doctor cleared us. It took about eight months for her to get pregnant, which stressed her out a lot because she got pregnant so easily with our first. This pregnancy was different. She had no energy. She gained a lot of weight and was unrecognizable. With our first son, she only had a small bump and you wouldn't have even known she was pregnant if you saw her from behind or if she was wearing an oversized shirt. With this pregnancy, she blew up like a balloon. Her face and feet were swollen. I sound like an asshole for saying this, but she looked like a monster. We didn't have sex for the entire pregnancy. Sometimes she would try to initiate, but I always turned her down because I was repulsed by her.\n\nShe had a difficult birth and our son was born with some health issues (relatively minor, thankfully, but enough to give us a scare). My wife blamed herself for our son's health issues. In the heat of the moment I told her that if she had been more active during pregnancy then our son probably would have been fine. She just kept sinking further and further into depression. She stopped brushing her hair and it started to mat. I would come home from work at 5pm to find our older son still in his pyjamas. The dirty dishes were piled a mile high in the sink. She stopped showering regularly and she refused to go on a jog to lose the baby weight even though I tried to encourage her by saying I'd cook dinner if she did. Our sons physical needs were being met, but emotionally she was checked out.\n\nI started fantasizing about being single and not having a wife or kids. I started going to the gym and the bar after work instead of going home to them. I met \"Cassidy\" (19F) at the gym and we really hit it off. She was vocal about never wanting kids and when I would complain about my wife to her, she would pile on too. I was happy at the time because I wanted someone to validate me for being such an asshole, but looking back I'm disgusted. Pretty soon Cassidy and I were dating and I was having a whole separate life behind my wife's back.\n\nAfter a few months, my wife slowly started to return to her old self. She started taking more pride in her appearance and started cooking from scratch again instead of ordering takeout or frozen food. Our home was clean again and our younger son's health issues were improving. I fell in love with her all over again. I started to realize that Cassidy wasn't as exciting and interesting as I thought she was. She was actually quite dull and stupid and had no real opinions or interests outside of partying and TikTok. I started to suspect that she didn't actually like me either and was just flattered by the attention of a married man and I stupidly enabled it by making her feel special and better than my wife. I ended things with her a few months later and she didn't even seem to care. All in, I was cheating on my wife for just over a year.\n\nMy wife has recently started asking to try for a third baby and the guilt all just hit me at once. I feel paralyzed. I have nightmares that she finds out from someone else. I've stopped eating and sleeping. I'm starting to get aches and pains from the stress. I don't know what to do. I know I'm an asshole. I know I don't deserve her. But I don't know how to tell her without breaking her. She's amazing and she never deserved this.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678678293.0},{"title":"25 M 24 F ex broke up over different levels of maturities.

We broke up briefly and ended up back together and life went on. I\u2019ve felt like a POS about it and tried to make things right.\n\nI have for the entire relationship from that point on been questioned, reminded and scolded over that fuckup.

During the drive my wife called and I let it ring out because I hate having loudspeaker conversations in front of other people and it was such a short drive. When I later spoke to my wife she asked if anyone was in the car with me and I told her there was and who it was. She lost it. I was hiding it from her, I was a liar and there must be something going on.\nI\u2019ve tried explaining that I didn\u2019t say anything because I knew how she felt and I just wanted to avoid an argument. And why I didn\u2019t answer in the car.\n\nSince having kids this has become far worse due to medical issues that prevent us from being intimate as often and her feeling more unhappy in her body. She reminds me how unhappy she is every few weeks and brings up females at my work and all our issues around intimacy. I\u2019m told I\u2019m flirty with everyone, I\u2019m a liar and that I would be better off elsewhere. \n\nI don\u2019t know how to continue dealing with this. I can\u2019t do it forever.

I try to spice things up, but I get no effort on the return. I pretty much do all the giving and I don't get any return. We moved in recently and it has progressively gotten worse, so much so that we maybe engage once a week.\n\nI have approached her multiple times about why she doesn't initiate anymore and why is it me that is always doing the work. We land up fighting because of this. To make matters worse is that when I am sitting down doing work or playing online (on the rare occasion i want to have my own time to myself), and when it gets close to bed time she would throw it in my face that I don't want to have sex with her because I am not getting ready to go to bed (which is also another issue, when she wants to go to bed, I am forced to stop what I am doing so that I can go to bed as well, even though I have a different time that I go to bed since most days I am working and running my own business). \n\nWhen I spend time with her I do activities that she likes ,and we have a great time. But as soon as I want to do something that I like, I get  minimal effort and\/or a fight ensues because the things I want to do are boring or not interesting ( I like to watch movies or wanting to go camping, which she refuses to go). We have had many fights over the years because of the things she says to insult me, my mother or my family. or does things that deliberately causes a fight like being extremely messy and expects  me to clean up after her ( she grew up in a household where her mom and brother treated her like shit and everyone would make the house extremely dirty because they would expect one person or the other to clean up after the mess)\n\nOn two occasions that I tried to leave the relationship which she landed up manipulating me to stay. The last fight we had I couldn't take the manipulation anymore and I started packing my things and she threatened to kill herself which has led me here.\n\nI am not happy with where things are going, I tried speaking to her about our intimate relationship, or to get her to stop being messy around the apartment to no avail as it leads us to a fight. The love I have for this girl is not there anymore, not the same way as it was when we 1st started dating, where things were passionate and we were extremely happy. At the time I was dealing with her ex boyfriend who was abusing her and even tried to kill her. I eventually had to get a restraining order against the guy as he was stalking and threatening to kill the both of us. After he stopped his nonsense, it was around the time where things between me and my girlfriend started to change. I know that she's not cheating on me as she is a complete introvert and avoids people. But nowadays she saps the joy and energy out of me on a daily basis because no matter what I do, I know what I say or do would start a fight.\n\nI am just tired and I have invested a lot into this relationship and I am not getting much return from it.\nI do not earn a lot, we both earn the same in terms of our salary, and I try as much as I can financially, to do the things she wants to do. However , if it is an activity I want to do, I get depressed because she doesn't want to participate or sarcastically insults it.\n\nI need some advice on what to do. I cannot leave the relationship in fear of what she'd do. She has had a rough upbringing and childhood and went through an abusive relationship and I fear she would do something to get back at me. I have tried to get some help for her and even though i went and got for myself ( I suffer from PTSD and anxiety due to my service in the military), because she would manipulate or trick me into believing things that I said and did, even though I know it's not true.

I was recently relocated internationally through work to their HQ (I asked for this opportunity) on a visa \nPrior to my move I was reporting to my now bosses boss, but the move was a promotion for me and the role I\u2019m doing was aligned to my now bosses scope of our project and it made sense to report to him. \nPrior to this we had met in person once before and we had a semi working relationship but I never liked him much and thought he was just a bit bossy and demanding and extremely blunt \n\nHowever since I moved here, and over the last six months I\u2019ve been getting to know him more, I\u2019ve realised about a month and a half ago I\u2019ve got feelings for him. The more I get to know him the more I like him, he\u2019s an awesome boss and as I\u2019ve understood his style we\u2019ve both adapted and work and communicate extremely well together. \nI\u2019m also a very direct person so it means when I need help we have productive conversations \n\nWe\u2019ve socialised a few times outside of work and I honestly think there is a vibe between us. He\u2019s about 17-20 ish years older, he\u2019s single, and he is my direct boss where we\u2019re an extentend team of about 50 executing a large transformation project for our company - meaning while he\u2019s my boss, he\u2019s not at all involved in the work stream I\u2019m the lead of where I have my own accountable team members to me.

Conversation flows so naturally and we both I think can easily separate work and non work from what I can pick up on. He\u2019s a great listener and I think does care about me as a person as well as my success in this company, I know he thinks I\u2019m smart and he\u2019s commented lots about how adventurous I was to undertake the move I did. Basically he seems to respect me which honestly is not a feeling I\u2019m finding in any other dating scenario I\u2019ve had in the last number of months. \n\nI\u2019m incredibly attracted to him, even though in usual circumstances he wouldn\u2019t be my type.

How can I (31M) help partner (29F) get therapy for childhood trauma.","author":"ThrowRAlostinspaces","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11pph1y\/twcsa_how_can_i_31m_help_partner_29f_get_therapy\/","text":"\n\nHi,\n\nSorry about my spelling, I can't seem to get my spell check to work and I'm slightly dyslexic.\n\nMy (31M) partner (29F) has disclosed to me previously in our relationship that she experienced SA as a child. She has given me minimal details surrounding this. On the few occasions that the topic has come up, I have told her that I would like her to share for the reason that I believe it would be good to talk about it. I also said that it doesn't have to be me that she speaks to about it but that I don't want her to feel any pressure to do so and I won't bring the subject up.\n\nAside from that she also had a really fd up upbringing with an abusive (not sexual afaik) father plus a lot more on top which would cause all sorts of other issues.\n\nWe have a 2 year old child together. \n\nI'm no psychologist, but some basic reading on the internet shows she has a lot of common charachteristics of a CSA survivor. Unfortunately a lot of these issues are contribiting to our relationship falling apart and has just been deteriorating over the past few monts. I should mention that I'm not perfect and have had some reactions I'm ashamed off, but tbh my partner is currently going off the rails.\n\nI'm quite introverted and a bit of a loner, so I've not really spoken to anyone about any of our relationship issues. As a result, I had been just trying my hardest to fix things from my side. It is only tonight that my brother in law has got in touch and told me that all of her family are really concerned about the way she is acting aswell. It kind of hit home that I've been gaslit a little bit and made me realise that most of these issues are as a result of her actions. As soon as I got off the phone I cried harder than I ever remember.\n\nSo my issue is, I love and care for her so much. It's so hard to let her go and I really want to help her but I dont know how. I would probably have left this relationship a long time ago if it wasn't for our child. I should also state that there are of course good times, but as happens so often in these situations, they are less and less frequent.\n\nI believe that a lot of my partners behaviour is a result of the CSA but she refuses to get help for it. We spoke about couples therapy months ago and I was all for it. She was insistent or arranging it herself but never did. I raised this in a later argument and she said that she doesn't need therapy, only I do (I have this arranged). She later stated that we should both do individual therapy. I offered to sort one for her (she isn't very proactive tbh) and she said she would do it herself. She hasn't. \n\nI'm at a point where I feel our relationship is hanging by a thread. But I really feel that if she faces these issues, we can still make it. I'm also concerned for our child if I'm not there.\n\nSo my question is, would it be unfair of me to disclose the CSA to my partners older sister, who I now know is also very concerned about her, in the hope that it can help her get therapy? Half of me feels that if it can help her in the long run then I should do it but the other half feels that this would be a gross breach of trust when someone has shared something so sensitive and personal.\n\nHoping to see if theres a general concensus for this? Or alternatively, if there are any charities (UKbased) that I could tell that would reach out to her so at least I'm not breaching her trust with a close family member.\n\nTIA for any help.\n\nTLDR - is it out of line to disclose partner's CSA to family member in the hope it gets them the help I believe they need?","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678654276.0},{"title":"My (F27) best friend (F27) snores so damn loud","author":"kirastryker","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11pn2j6\/my_f27_best_friend_f27_snores_so_damn_loud\/","text":"tldr: My friend snores so loud that sleepovers have gotten unbearable and I don't know what to do.\n\nEmily and I have been friends since we were kids, and now that we're fully grown adults we'll sleep over at each other\u2019s places from time to time.\n\nI've always loved having her over, but recently she's started snoring.

I feel very lonely and hopeless right now, and I am in desperate need for help.\n\nMy boyfriend (23M) and I (21F) officially have been together for a month, known each other for 5 months so far. Ever since we became close, we started having little arguments mainly due to miscommunication\/misinterpretations.\n\nLast night, we just had a major argument, resulting in him becoming really upset at me, which I deserve. We were having a conservation through text, and he randomly brought up about this nightclub. I told him how it\u2019s funny because I just searched up that exact nightclub earlier yesterday. He asked me why I searched it up, and I said I just wanted to see what it looks inside. He said \u201cNo one looks up the inside of a club for no reason\u201d and I replied \u201cI look up random things okayy because I\u2019ve never been there\u201d He then kept asking me \u201cBut why? There\u2019s always a reason\u201d and then followed by \u201cDo your friends want to go or smt?\u201d And then I said \u201cWell yeah my friends did mention they want to go with me sometime\u201d\n\nHe then said \u201cI knew someone asked!\u201d And then he proceeded to ask me if I\u2019m still going to this rave later this month. I told him \u201cyeah maybe..\u201d\nAnd then few conversations later, he straight up told me \u201cJust be straight forward next time \u2018maybe\u2019 isn\u2019t a yes or no to me and you saying just looking at a club for fun. \ud83e\udd28\u201d\n\nNow, he said this because he thinks no one looks up the club for no reason. He said \u201cLike why couldn\u2019t you just tell me your friends wanna go to the club? It\u2019s not that hard.\u201d And he told me I shouldn\u2019t say \u201cmaybe\u201d and should\u2019ve said yes or not because he thinks I\u2019m actually going to the rave, when in reality I\u2019m actually still thinking about going so that\u2019s why I said \u201cmaybe.\u201d\n\nHe thinks I\u2019m hiding something from him because I wasn\u2019t being that clear twice in the row. I might admit it\u2019s my fault for not clarifying it more with him because I did actually look up the club because my friends do want to go with me. But I looked up that club more specifically because I was randomly curious to see what it looks like, and I tried defending myself on that, but he just doesn\u2019t seem to believe me on this.\n\nBecause of that, he thinks I seemed so afraid of telling him that. But I was also truthful about saying \u201cmaybe\u201dabout going to the rave. I just didn\u2019t clarify the reason enough why I\u2019m still thinking about going in the first place.\n\nHe got upset at me and I tried telling him \u201cI\u2019d never lie or hide from you. I was actually looking up photos of the club randomly for fun. For the rave, I said maybe I\u2019m still actually thinking of going because our group isn\u2019t big enough, and I really wanted you to come, that\u2019s why I asked you to come. But I guess I\u2019ll be more clear next time.\u201d\nHe replied to that with \u201c \u201cI guess\u201d nice way to end it\u201d , referring to how I wrote \u201cI guess I\u2019ll be more clear next time\u201d in that text. And that\u2019s all after that.\n\nI tried my best to communicate with him and clear more things up for him, but he was giving me dry responses. I kept apologizing and reassuring him that I\u2019m being honest and I have nothing to hide from him and I\u2019m not afraid to talk to him, over and over. I can honestly understand how he thought I was hiding something last night because I wasn\u2019t being straightforward. But I also feel like he was being too hard on me last night.\n\nThis morning, I kept asking if we could call so we could talk about it and work on communicating more. He told me \u201cNo you did this to yourself, so not my fault\u201d and \u201cYou keep saying we need to communicate better and it\u2019s you that\u2019s screwing up\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t need to hear you say sorry anymore\u201d\n\nEventually I finally got him to call me and I tried apologizing again and explaining myself. But he gave me silent treatment for 10-15 mins and acted very upset and cold to me. He thinks I\u2019m just repeating myself over and over again on what I\u2019ve said on text beforehand, and how it\u2019s a waste of time for him. He thinks I can\u2019t change for what I did, and he doesn\u2019t want to think anymore. I told him I\u2019ll work on communicating better and he said \u201cWhatever I hope so.\u201d\n\nWe got silent after that and he said \u201cSo..are we done now?\u201d. I asked him if he\u2019s still upset with me and he kept dodging the question and he said he doesn\u2019t want to talk about it anymore. We said our byes and he hung up really fast.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. He hasn\u2019t texted me since then. I promised to him I\u2019ll work on communicating better. I don\u2019t want to be a bad girlfriend to him or someone that would just apologize for their behavior then turn around and do it again. I really did mean it when I apologized and I take responsibility of my actions and I saw how deeply it upset him. I should\u2019ve been more clear with him.\n\nI feel like this is completely my fault because we keep telling each other to communicate with each other well, but yet, we always end up in an argument. He\u2019s generally a very caring and loving person and loves me very much and is willing to work things out with me, no matter how bad it gets. But I don\u2019t know how I feel about last night. He\u2019s so upset with me and wouldn\u2019t talk to me. I really want to make this relationship work and I am really willing to do whatever it takes. I don\u2019t want this relationship to turn out unhealthy, especially since we\u2019ve been dating for only a month and we already started arguing.\n\nKeep in mind, we constantly text each other throughout the day. More than we facetime\/call each other. I tried telling him texting isn\u2019t the same as talking face-to-face in person, so it\u2019s hard to tell through texting and it could result in a lot of misinterpretations. \n\nI know I can\u2019t keep begging someone to forgive me or else it\u2019d drive them away more, so should I just give him space?\n\nTLDR I didn\u2019t communicate well with my boyfriend and have apologized to him several times, but he won\u2019t forgive me.","upvote_ratio":0.33,"created_utc":1678675224.0},{"title":"I (F21) Broke a guys heart (M24) but was it my fault?","author":"sofialily6667252","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11pp8ig\/i_f21_broke_a_guys_heart_m24_but_was_it_my_fault\/","text":"I came out of a 4 year relationship and I ended up speaking to this new guy around 4 months later.

We planned to move in together for 2nd year but after a series of events we went our separate ways. Although this caused some conflict we were still close friends at the end of the year and it worked out best for everyone. \n\nThe problem came in the summer. Me and Ella would regularly check in, however we both had little contact with Anna. At one point I reached out and we had a good catch up however she ultimately left me on read. \n\nThere was nothing wrong with this, I just figured she was busy. But then she started messaging my boyfriend Carl (M25), complimenting him on his pictures (\u2018model material\u2019) and then private messaging him. Anna revealed she had gotten back together with a guy she had been on and off with, this was exciting news but she wanted Carl to keep this secret until she could see me in person (a month away) \n\nI was hurt and messaged her asking her why she didn\u2019t come to me and felt the need to talk to my boyfriend first. She was defensive and couldn\u2019t see what she had done wrong as she considered Carl a friend as much as me.\n\nElla saw Anna\u2019s behaviour as completely disrespectful. She sent some harsh messages to Anna which was likely the driving force of Anna cutting off communication with us, despite me asking her to meet up and talk in person. \n\nNow flash forward to today. Ella and I have become closer, sometimes hanging with my boyfriend or in larger groups with her flatmates. Recently however Ella has been on a break with her long term boyfriend. This is having an effect on her mental health and I feel for her and am trying to be a supportive friend. \n\nHowever last week she messaged Carl randomly asking for a favour. He didn\u2019t see the message until much later and showed me. He then asked her what was up and she said \u2018doesn\u2019t matter now thank you though :)\u2019 \n\nThis confused me but I figured I\u2019d ask her about it when I saw her. She then messaged me the next day and told me a man had been stalking her in the park. I was very shocked and worried and told her I was here if she needed me. \n\nI then asked her about the favour. She told me she had tried to contact Carl, hoping he would walk her home from the park. This honestly made me quite upset and I wasn\u2019t sure why she hadn\u2019t just called me if she had been scared for her safety. We both would have come. \n\nToday she commented on my boyfriend\u2019s story \u2018very dapper\u2019. This has upset me further, especially considering our history with Anna. It just feels as though she is acting out because she is in a bad place. Although i sympathise I feel like she is not considering my feelings. \n\nI want to distance myself\/ take space from our friendship. This is seriously starting to give me a complex about friendships and bringing me down a lot.

The last one I got loud and so did she and it ended with me walking her out of my house while she waited for a ride , because ei was so messed up. I ended up letting her back in but it was when she said the other day \u201chow could you close the door on me when it\u2019s cold out if you love me - like who fucking does that\u201d and it\u2019s true. I messed up and trust me I haven\u2019t been drinking since and I have been in therapy since. It was a month ago. During the last fight, we were both fighting loud so I had her wait outside for her ride because I just struggle with conflict and I needed it to stop.  No excuse but yes I\u2019m getting therapy and yes I have stopped drinking. \n\nThen we hung out and took it slow for the past month, everything was great getting better started saying she loved me again etc. then we had sex and she said that she didn\u2019t feel the spark and it made it worse. she said that - which is probably because she hadn\u2019t forgiven me yet. And the night after we had sex she said things like I thought you were going to be my husband, I can\u2019t let go of you, I want you to be my husband some day. \n\nSo we started not talking. And this is gonna be wild, but we follow each other on Spotify, so we can see what each other listens to. I saw she began listening to the same song I was - \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d by Blake Shelton. I thought it was a little odd, so then I played \u201cI miss you\u201d by blink-182 and immediately she played \u201cmiss you more\u201d by Adele. So I played I love you by Billie Ellish , she plays the same. I played \u201cis this goodbye\u201d and she played \u201cnot forever\u201d \n\nFast forward 5 days, I collapse and text her. She admitted to the Spotify thing and said \u201cidk why I did that\u201d. Now she is saying she doesn\u2019t know if she can be with me again, she\u2019s still loves me and isn\u2019t over me. Then will say it\u2019s over, then said I can\u2019t give you another chance right now, then said I can\u2019t forget everything, and even said I don\u2019t know if I can be with you again and I\u2019m so sad but I\u2019m letting you go. She also said \u201cyou left me outside in the cold for a little while. If you love me why would you do that - like who fucking does that\u201d \n\nHowever, before this she didn\u2019t know if she was taking this space to move on from me or think about things to talk about being together again. This was before she said the above\u2026. Then when she said the above I said what about what you said last week and she said \u201cI didn\u2019t know there was a timeline\u201d. \n\nSo I ended up sending a really long apology \u2026 etc. I\u2019ll include it below if you want to read it. Anyways, I blocked her on everything because of it. After I did, I saw she blocked me on Twitter. And this morning my friend said \u201cyou look weak blocking so unblock.\u201d So, I did\u2026. And within an HOUR she unblocked me on Twitter?\n\nJust a note, outside of these three times we never had issues. It was always so good between us, high chemistry etc. I just need to fix myself right now. \n\nCan someone help me with this or give me a suggestion on what is happening? \n\n\nHere\u2019s the text:\n\nLook, this is long\u2026 read it or don\u2019t. This is my feelings, my mind, my body speaking. And If I could sum my feelings before I say goodbye, I guess this would be them:\n\nAlthough I take full responsibility for how I acted when I was drunk, I needed help. I needed someone who was willing to discuss those issues, and try to compromise with. It meant a lot to me. No my reaction wasn\u2019t good, nor will it ever be acceptable, but like I said I am sorry. I know you can\u2019t forgive me because if you could, this situation would be different. In time, I hope you accept my remorse. \n\nThrough therapy, I discovered it\u2019s very hard for me to not be acknowledged, when I was young my opinion was always belittled. Then when I was a teenager, my friends did the same. I truly bottled it all up, but now am finding ways to circumvent that. \n\nI am struggling really badly with letting go, because I feel there is an underlying issue that we just never discussed - being those situations. I get it if you needed time (now), but now I know we may never have that conversation. And it aches my heart entirely that we have ended, and we aren\u2019t giving it a second chance. I feel we have something that doesn\u2019t happen often, but it could also happen again (with someone else) which is what I know you\u2019re banking on - and that\u2019s fine. I fucked up, but I will probably never stop asking myself \u201cwhat if\u201d. \n\nWhen I first told you I loved you, I meant it. I know love is crazy, hurtful, amazing, etc. but love to me will always be a learning path. I hate starting new because I give everything I have to that person, literally every last fiber in me. I\u2019m sorry I had those three out bursts, and it destroys me I\u2019ll never get a second chance with you. That\u2019s also why it\u2019s hard to let go though - because I am always open to making myself better especially for not only myself, but the person I love because that\u2019s how much I cherish them.  And above all, I lose my utter best friend. My best friend in the whole world is gone. That gives me that heavy chest and just cry feeling. The worst feeling possible. Because I don\u2019t want to lose my girlfriend and best friend in one shot. But I guess that\u2019s how it goes. \n\nI know we\u2019ve only been together for a short time, but it felt like a lifetime of happiness. I just wanted to say I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry for the things I have said, I\u2019m sorry for acting the ways I did and I\u2019m sorry if you are hurting too because you don\u2019t deserve that. I wish I had one more chance with you, because I know I messed up - but I understand you don\u2019t give them. People break trust. Just know, I would never do that to you  because I mean everything I say when it comes to being better. \n\nI just stick by the ones I love, and I always try to help them. Because that is what love is to me. It\u2019s about learning together, growing, and working together. But thank you for everything. And like I said, if this is goodbye, then goodbye <her name>. You\u2019ll always be my best friend.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678674599.0},{"title":"My [31 m] wife [26 f] cheated on me 6 years ago.","author":"ThrowRAll63","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11pxit1\/my_31_m_wife_26_f_cheated_on_me_6_years_ago\/","text":"I just found out that my wife cheated on me 6 years ago and I don\u2019t know how to process it. \n\nMy wife gave birth a month ago and she\u2019s been dealing with quite severe postpartum depression.

I ultimately noticed patterns of behavior that led me to conclude she has some form of narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), though have a hard time questioning my judgment\/speaking my truth due to the gaslighting.\n\nWe've dated since August of 2018, quarantined together, and kept talking about marriage and starting a family, but I ultimately called it off because I noticed patterns of emotional abuse\/neglect and overstepping of boundaries in her and her family that caused me to think that I didn't want to have to deal with defending my dignity in front of my future kids. I brought up some of my concerns to her on a return flight home from her country of origin (India) to mine (the U.S.), and quite a bit was said:\n\n1. she couldn't promise that she would refrain from name-calling in the future (she basically argued \"I want to call it like I see it\")\n2. I told her she needs to see a therapist because I witnessed both of her parents emotionally neglect her and her siblings; I had to rely on her for some context due to a language barrier, but body language, shouting, and what was translated to me led me to my recommendation (when I told her this, I was met with resistance and emphasis that \"nothing is wrong with my family; other people had it way worse than me\" even when I brought up that I was her longest\/most serious relationship, so maybe I'm most qualified to recommend this)\n3. I felt like my attempts at emotional intimacy\/vulnerability were neglected and not worthy of conversation; it seemed as though she viewed any displays of vulnerabilities as one person playing \"the victim\" - while my thinking is that there are periods of life when we're victims and (some of us) are oppressors, and my attempts at having this discussion were not to judge, but rather to relate to each other. At one point on the trip, she shared that she'd had some insecurities - when I'd noticed this in the past, I'd been chastised for not validating\/supporting her which seemed reasonable, but I was also thinking that the insecurities might belie deeper issues that therapy could address that I was not comfortable\/qualified to try and do.\n\nFor context, there have been multiple occasions in which she'd resorted to name-calling during fights (or just difficult times in general), calling me names such as stupid, idiot, and a coward (among others I'm sure I'm forgetting), and I always thought that this shouldn't be a boundary anyone crosses in a healthy relationship, no matter the circumstances. The most recent time, I was called \"fucking stupid\" for getting separated shortly after our plane landed and we had to rush to the next one, and even after I explained my side of the story\/the efforts I took to avoid getting separated and that maybe it was just unfortunate\/a stroke of bad luck, I got the lackluster half-apology of \"where I'm from, it's important to assign blame to prevent whatever bad thing from happening again\" (I honestly can't remember if she apologized for this or not - as of now I think she did, but I can't be certain). As the years passed, I'd gotten better at setting and sticking to my boundaries, but I didn't ever follow up with consequences\/actions when they were crossed other than shutting down the conversation when it reached that point.\n\nAnd the gaslighting was awful: during the final days of our trip, we'd had a discussion about the logistics of our travel day (wake-up times, meals, etc), and the next day started to have the same discussion before I casually reminded her that we'd already had it. She keeps repeating that it never happened, though this time I held my ground and insisted (asking her why I'd make something like that up), and eventually, she said something like \"well if we did I forgot, so let's have the conversation again\". I get that forgetfulness happens, and she had been feeling sick throughout the trip, but to me, this was just another instance of her not listening to what I was saying that seemed to fit with the broader conclusion I was beginning to draw. Moreover, this was just one recent instance, but there have been a handful of other instances that were gray areas between gaslighting (conscious or unconscious) and genuine forgetfulness, and as I began to call her out on some of these times, she appeared to feel guilty and wanted to distance herself from anyone placing those types of accusations on her.\n\nThis was all three weeks ago, and since then I've started therapy (which has helped a little bit), have begun journaling, and I'm proud of myself for not reaching out to her during this time for anything other than logistics; however, we did make a lot of good memories together, she does have some admirable qualities (like assertiveness\/confidence), and I have memories of feeling genuine love from her. She'd forgiven me for some of what I viewed as \"mistakes\" during our relationship (at one point I'd redownloaded tinder\/bumble which led to a fight in the middle of the pandemic), and I want to extend that same goodwill to her. I just don't feel like I can do so at the risk of my mental health or having to explain in a future fight in front of my kids that I'm not an idiot and that sometimes bad\/stupid things just happen.\n\nAs of now, I'm like 90% certain I made the right decision, but the lingering 10% just keeps gnawing at me despite the therapy and journaling. I keep ruminating, hate feeling like the victim, and thinking that she would have improved at respectfully disagreeing\/honoring boundaries over time. I'm happy to provide any additional details\/context I can to those interested; I recognize that this is a one-sided account of events and she's not able to defend herself.\n\nTL;DR: I suspect my partner of 4.5 years had some version of NPD and broke up with her as a result, but I'm wondering if I made the right decision or let someone I love slip away from me.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678674422.0},{"title":"I (29m) want to write a letter to an exgf (27f) with who I broke up on good terms due to bad timing","author":"Adventurous_Air2381","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11pxhjf\/i_29m_want_to_write_a_letter_to_an_exgf_27f_with\/","text":"We only knew each other for about 2 months, but they were the most passionate 2 months Ive ever felt with anyone.

Totally reasonable in the end. She kind of took me on an emotional rollercoaster, but now that the grieving stage is over.. I get it.\n\nIn either case, she told me she loved me so much, would miss me forever and would regret losing me. We talked one final night saying how much we meant, and at the end she blocked my number saying it was so she wasnt tempted to cave and text me.\n\nNow that I can think more clearly about things, I just want to tell her one final set of thoughts, basically just telling her I understand, forgive her, and that if the time ever comes when she feels ready to be committed with someone again, she can try to reach out and not be afraid. Im not upset, or angry. I just miss her.\n\nI dont know how to say this though without seeming like a creep since my number is blocked, but its eating me alive that I cant let it out.

I was high on the thought I found someone I could go to a country music concert with, stop for hot wings on the way home, do corny stuff like play super smash together, and end the night in bed with someone I\u2019ve never been more compatible with in that too.\n\nEven if I only knew you for a few weeks, I thought the world of that future we could\u2019ve had and it haunts me that we never got the chance to see if we could have those perfect nights. Besides that I fell for little things I never even noticed in other people, like your voice, the feel of your hands in my hair and mine in yours, your cute nose; the way your hugs just melted into mine.\n\nIf you do see this, you don\u2019t need to answer it, but you should know that if you do find yourself grown out of whatever phase you\u2019re in and feel like you are ready to have a real committed shot with someone who cares about you, you can always try to reach out. I need to do some more growing myself and work on how to handle things better too. I don\u2019t know when that will be or if I\u2019d even be available then, but try.

Unfortunately, my screening showed that I had the disease.\n\nI know this would have a massive impact on my girlfriend, and I tried to give her an opportunity to consider whether this news changed how she felt about me and whether she would want to consider pursuing a life together despite the challenges that lay before us. During this time, she was incredibly supportive of me, told me she loved me and wanted to stay with me. Because of this I proposed and we got engaged.\n\nFast forward to Feb this year, we hadn\u2019t done any wedding planning despite my constant desire to get a date down. After some pressing, she told me that she hadn\u2019t told her parents about my diagnosis out of fear that they would tell her to break up with me. I told her this is something she\u2019d have to face eventually (and she told me she had decided to stay with me) so I kind of forced her to let her parents know. They blew up. They basically told her it\u2019s either me or them.\n\nHer parents are first generation immigrants (like my own parents) and hold fairly traditional beliefs. During this time, they\u2019ve been generally supportive of me, and I had even asked her father for permission before proposing, to which he agreed. However, once they found out about my diagnosis, they went nuclear and told my fianc\u00e9 that health is the number one key to happiness in life. I gave my fianc\u00e9 about a month to decide whether she\u2019d want to stay with me, or leave me. During the last week of this period, I spent time at my parents to give her some space to make her own decision.  I was keen for this decision to be hers alone. Unfortunately, her parents did not agree, and her father visited her 3 or 4 times over this period. Her mother also sent incredibly guilty messages, suggesting people would think of her as a \u201closer\u201d for staying with me and that she would never forgive her if her father broke down (who\u2019s dealing with the onset of illness of his own mother).\n\nUnfortunately this led my fianc\u00e9 to deciding to leave me, practically making a split second decision when I told her the month was up. It was incredibly heart breaking to leave 6 years of pure bliss on what felt like an unfair decision and thankfully she too felt that way. We met up 2 days after the break up and told me she wanted to make things work between us. However her parents have been sending her messages since she told her that she was leaving me, telling her that her father is her families\u2019 rock and that this would have broke him and her family. I know she cares a lot about her family and this is making her mind flip-flop. I have arranged an emergency therapy session for her in a couple of days time, but knowing how easily my fianc\u00e9 can be manipulated by her parents, I\u2019m worried she\u2019d turn on me again and force me to leave the life we\u2019ve built together, again.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to be fair and honourable to the woman that I love and I understand this is an incredibly difficult decision to make, made incredibly more challenging by her family. I know she doesn\u2019t want to turn her back on them, but she has told me that if her parents were supportive she would have chosen to stay with me. I know they will get desperate if she tells them she wants to be with me and this may get her to choose the easier option (which would be to leave me rather than her family). How can we\/she approach this situation with her parents?\n\nTL;DR I was diagnosed with long term illness which my partners parents have only just found out about and are trying to break up our 6 year relationship. She initially chose to leave me then regretted her decision, and is now unsure how to approach her parents to tell them we want to be together. What can we\/she do to overcome this challenge?","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1678552824.0},{"title":"My (25M) tinder date (23F) asked me to be her bf and I accepted, but now I\u2019m having second thoughts.","author":"Federal_Door5785","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11pxfhy\/my_25m_tinder_date_23f_asked_me_to_be_her_bf_and\/","text":"I have met my now girlfriend on a dating app and we have only been talking for three weeks prior.

However as early as February 2022, somebody confessed to me, and it was a friend in the same circle as my ex. This guy has liked me for years. I told him I was not ready and would like to take this year \\[2022\\] to heal. I'm not sure if he understood that but he kept on messaging me, and my fool self who wasn't able to experience romance for months continued replying as well. Fast forward, we go out for like 2-3 times and continue chatting. I tried opening myself again by being vulnerable but I think I should have just stood by myself and chosen to really just rest and give my time to heal from my past relationship.\n\nAnyway, I think almost 2 months after the confession, spending time with him was like choking, I feel like I couldn't breathe and constantly walking on eggshells. Put it like I am the first girl she dated ever, so he acts like high school in terms of communication with a partner. Another issue for me was that he also actually confessed to another girl a month before he confessed to me \\[January 2022\\], and that girl also confessed that she liked him, but she's already in a relationship with another guy. The issue was, the two of them kept on chatting while we were dating, and he never mentioned to her that we were dating, or there was someone he was currently dating. That weirded me out as hell.\n\nI am the type who really needs to know a guy first before I could start to really like him, like knowing him deeply. So I struggled at the time we were dating because it felt like I was the only one being vulnerable. I tried asking him questions, know him, tell him personal stuff, but he never initiated. I also didn't like it when he mentioned he was just taking chances with that girl she confessed to and to me, being intentional is a big deal for me. It exhausted me, for someone who was supposed to be healing, tending to a person who doesn't even know himself was draining as hell. To be completely honest with you guys, I still have feelings for my ex at that time, and I told him that. I also told him it's gonna be hard for me to give love again.\n\nI took the courage to tell him I don't want to continue what we have and that we will see in the future if we would still \"like\" each other. He reacted quite immaturely in my PoV at that time, and so I thought, thank me for stopping it asap. It felt like I just dodged a bullet.\n\nThen the other day, I received a message from him, saying he was drunk. The same way he confessed to me, saying he was drunk and all. I think he sent that to act as a green light if ever I engage in that message. Anyway, I'm not sure how to handle him now, I don't think I got anything to say to him atm. It complicates things because that circle of friends I mentioned in the beginning, like him for me. I feel like the bad guy cutting his chance asap.  \n\n\n TLDR: I stopped seeing a guy I dated last year and told him \"let's see in the future if we still like each other\", now he is sending me a drunkin message, which I think acts like a green signal for him if I engage with it.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678673402.0},{"title":"My girlfriend (31f) cheated and I (32m) have a difficult time coping with it","author":"ThrowRA_burneruser","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11prqtl\/my_girlfriend_31f_cheated_and_i_32m_have_a\/","text":"My GF (31f) cheated and I (32m) have a difficult time coping with it\n\nThis was more than a few months ago.

For the past month or so, I've been talking to this girl seriously - although honestly, it hasnt been super stable. For one thing, me and her started talking two weeks after her ex and her broke up, so I felt like a rebound - and have been constantly questioning my status to her over the course of the month. It's hard for me to cope with the idea that she said the same things she says to me just over a month ago to her ex, and that she truly doesnt think of me as a rebound. Besides that, the first week, she told me about a couple guys that like her, and I asked her if she ever flirted with them and she told me no, but a week into talking to her, I found messages on her phone flirting with all of these guys the week before she met me. Her reasoning, which is valid, was that she was looking for attention and she didn't really like any of them, which I believe. But I told her that I had lost some trust because she lied to me that early on, and in addition, she had brought me in front of some of those people and it was hard for me to not feel silly or dumb around them anymore. In addition, there have been some other weird things. She told me that a family friend of hers had been pretty touchy with her the week after she got out of her relationship but she didn't reciprocate and was sorta uncomfortable with it- but I saw her snapping him selfies(which she rarely ever does, like she doesn't even like taking pictures with me because she doesn't like looking at her face) during the time that we were talking - and him flirting with her. It made me super distrustful, insecure, and jealous - and it all leads up into something terrible that I've done.\n\nThe day after seeing her talk to that family friend, I hit up a girl that I used to talk to and started flirting with her for an hour - all with the intention of showing this current girl that I had other options. I wasn't bored or horny, I wanted this girl to see parts of the conversation to show her that I wasn't to be played with. I can't justify my actions or give excuses, but I can offer my explanation, just to tell you all where I was coming from. I didn't feel like I was anything more than a rebound that she was using to feel better, and I thought our relationship had a short lifespan. However, in the weeks following that, I got to know her better, talked to her ab her own trust issues, and some of her deep insecurities. It allowed me to empathize with her more, trust her, and understand her more. I gained deep feelings for her, and that's why the next part hurts. She found the notifications from my flirty conversation with the old girl, and I didn't know how to tell her the truth, so I told her a lie, which I take full accountability for. She pressed further, hit up the person I flirted with, and asked her if I had done anything with her. The person I flirted with told her that I had flirted with her and said I texted her sexually(which we had done in the past, but not in the past conversation). \n\nMy girl got very upset(as she should have), and told me she was done with me, but after I told her my reasoning, and why I broke down to that point, she told me she'd give me one more chance. But since then, she's been super distant, angry, and told me she didn't feel like talking to me as much as she used to. It's making me upset and I can't forgive myself for my actions. I'm not someone who gets very angry or loses their cool very often, so it's very out of character for me to do what I did. I want to earn her forgiveness - but am worried she will never get over it. She has serious trust issues from her past relationships, where she's been cheated on, and I can't believe I did the same thing to her. I want to make things right, and I understand that comes from actions, but it's hard to forgive myself for this because I know how much this is hurting her. Even though me and her weren't official, we were exclusive, and I can't believe I had the audacity to do this to her, and I am trying to work on these communication issues I have. Me and her have talks about it and she tells me that she forgives me, takes accountability for some of the things she did, and tells me that she wants to work on these problems with me, but then she will go back to being dry, emotionless, angry, and distant. It makes me upset because I know she really cared about me - and I cannot tell her to get over it, because I know I really fucked up.\n\nI want to know if you guys think there is hope for this.

My boyfriend often states how he hates being at his house since he has things going on. I always try my best to comfort him and be there for him. So to have a break from his family he goes to his cousin's for a stayover. \nHe seems to be happier and more carefree there. He forgets about everything, about me too. It's okay. \"It's fine,\" I told myself. He needs space too and deserves to be carefree.\n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 While he's there he often plays games and goes out sometimes. He sends me a morning text and he apologises for ignoring me and not giving me time all day. I tell him not to since it's not that big of a deal. 2 days without having a proper conversation with my boyfriend is fine, I miss him though. He said he would be there for 2 days. Suddenly he extended that trip to 4 days since things at his home weren't the greatest. He again apologised for him ignoring me. I asked him not to, it was okay. I tried to comfort him.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Later he hits me up with a text saying he got some time to talk to me. I was over the moon! I was feeling very happy. For the past few days, I haven't been feeling very great. I didn't tell that to my boyfriend because I didn't want to ruin his little vacation. He was taking too long to reply. I was kinda sad. He did that a few times in these 2-4 days where he would say he has time to talk to me and then proceeded to ghost me. I was upset because of how easily he would forget about me and not even spear me a few minutes from his day. He would just keep apologising for ghosting me, which is annoying. \n\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0 It's not that I'm upset over him not communicating with me it's the fact that he is promising me something and then just leaving me with a cold shoulder. He legit texted me at 2 am that he had a game to play and he'll get back to me in 30-40 minutes. 1 and a half hours passed and he still didn't text back so I simply texted him good night and fell asleep. The very next day he did the same thing again.\n\n    I have confronted him a couple of times in the past when he did the same thing. He often apologises and says he's being a horrible human and he's scared that I might leave him which is too much for an apology. When he says things like this I instantly start feeling guilty. The only thing that's keeping me from confronting him again is I know how he would react to it and I'll get disappointed. He's trying his best but he still lacks and comes off as irresponsible. \n\nTLTR: My boyfriend is at his cousin's for a stayover. He extends his stay there for a few more days since he has things going on at his home and doesn't feel like going home.

I really thought I was over her. I\u2019m not. \n\n(I\u2019m using a different account because my ex occasionally looks at my main.)\n\nSorry for the post being so long. \n\nFor context, I\u2019m 27m and she\u2019s 26F, we broke up a year ago at the beginning of March 2022. It was a horrible break up. She wouldn\u2019t listen to a single thing because she was mad that it took me so long to come back to being myself while I was depressed. She even emotionally cheated on me with her ex while I was deep under water in my depression.\n\nWell, just about a week ago we had a long talk again. Unfortunately because she got an apartment just 2 miles away from my house, we\u2019ve either run into each other, or have had to keep in contact because her name is still on the mortgage. Well, we talked for what felt like 12 hours and time flew by. Like it was normal again, she even apologized. She told me she was sorry that she wasn\u2019t enough, that wasn\u2019t there for me, and apologized for cheating. She took the blame. I apologized to. I emotionally locked up when I had fallen in my depression that was caused by a bad job I was working. I took my stress out on her on some dumb thinks that either got under my skin or just confused me. \n\nI have no excuses that I can say for what I did. I regret it so very much. I shouldn\u2019t have hidden my emotions and what was going on from her. I thought it would stress her out so I figured what I was doing was correct. I just wanted her to be happy and not cause her to fall in depression; which it did start her depression instead.\n\nOne of things she said during our conversation was that I said all the right words and things. If I had said those words before the break up, we\u2019d still be together. But now, she\u2019s dating the guy she cheated on me with. Funny enough I found out that it wasn\u2019t just an ex, it was her first love. She chose him, over me. She\u2019s even preparing to move half way across the country to go live with him and leave behind her family and everyone. (Which is why I believe she apologized because in the next 2 months she\u2019s moving.)  \n \nI still love her. I still want her. There hasn\u2019t been a single day I haven\u2019t thought about her. We loved all the same hobbies, we had a house together, and a dog (she took him.) She perfectly understood me when I would get over stimulated, or when my anxiety would go nuts, and just hold my hand. She would help me understand sarcasm or other issues that my brain just would totally not understand. She was a women I wanted to marry, I was going to as well. I was ring shopping.\n\nEvery emotion in me is screaming. She knows I still love her. She knows how much I worry and care about her. After everything, she still means so much to me. My body is telling me to fight for her, to get her back. So everything can be normal again. There was so much bloody change when we broke up. I haven\u2019t felt the same since.\n\nWell, she put out a Reddit post randomly that I found. Basically that she was still having dreams about me. But that this was a happy one. That she wanted me to find love again, a new GF that would love me more than she did, and that would love me for who I am. That she was happy with her new\/old BF but wanted me to be happy because I was having trouble finding someone. That she misses me being her Best Friend because we always were honest and could talk about everything and anything. We had so much in common.\n\nOn the Reddit post she wants me to move on and be happy. To find someone new, trust me I do to. I want to love someone and be loved. I miss it so damn much. But, I loved her so much. She was amazing, she was the only person in my life who understood me, and helped me truly be happy so much in life. I honestly crave and want a relationship because of how it felt. But dating apps are either super confusing and well, apparently getting super excited over something in common and wanting to talk about it is the wrong move. I\u2019m just lost and confused. \n\nIf I could go backwards, I\u2019d stop myself, and attempt to fix everything; it\u2019s all I want. I want her back.. I know she\u2019s gone and they\u2019re nothing that I can do. \n\nBut my emotions are so mixed up. It just hurts and for the last year I\u2019ve been in pain. Yes, I\u2019m in active therapy and I have an amazing new puppy. I have a new epic job that has an amazing work life balance, but I\u2019m still hurt.

My mom and I don\u2019t have the best relationship but I thought our marriage was done and my husband was being really mean so we went to stay there.  \nI was really depressed and mentally\/emotionally was in a really bad state.

I was mad at him but requested that we talk about it the next day. There had been a few questions brewing in my mind that I wanted to ask him before, so I chose to ask him when we met up and after we resolved part of our conflict. \n\nThe main question I had was if he had watched porn. Now, here's the thing. A few months ago, he told me one night while we were laying in bed that he did not want to watch porn anymore. When I asked him why, he told me it was because \"I don't want to see any other woman naked but you.\" I said ok, and I agreed to stop watching porn in solidarity. Two weeks ago, we went on a week-long break because a bunch of conflicts came up, and I needed to take a breather and figure out if the relationship was serving me the way it should. \n\nNow that the context is out of the way, I asked him if he had watched porn since he first told me he wouldn't. He said yes, that he watched porn during our break. Naturally, I got upset because of this because it felt like a slap to the face that he lied to me. The appropriate time for him to have told me and come clean himself would have been after our break ended. Instead, I had to pry this information out of him. \n\nI also had a hunch about this girl that he's friends with, so I asked him about that too. He met this chick on a dating app, and they went on a few dates, but he ultimately decided to ghost her. This was last year. A week before this fight, he told me about her, and he said that she just switched to the same major as him, so they had a few classes together now. He said that they started talking again, and she invited him to her birthday party. He asked if I wanted to come, so I agreed because I was curious about their vibe. It felt like this girl was flirting with him somewhat throughout the whole night, and she didn't seem very enthused that I was there.\n\nI asked him to tell me the story of how he started talking to her again. He admitted that he was the one who talked to her first. Second punch in the gut. I've had plenty of opportunities to talk to exes and people that I went on dates with since we started dating, but I haven't because it feels disrespectful. \n\nNaturally, after hearing this, I was angry and told him such. I had a class at this time though, so I left and finished my class. I had plans that night that I made with my friends a week ago, so I went out to dinner and a movie with them until about midnight. No word from him. When I checked his location, he was at a party. \n\nI'm sorry that there is so much context I need to give for this to all make sense. A few months ago, he and a group of friends and I went out to party at frats, since we're all in college. One of his friends just broke up with his girlfriend, who we ran into. Mind you, she came with her friends, and she decided to tag along with us for some reason. My boyfriend is notorious for drinking too much and not being able to walk properly going back home. That exact thing happened that night, and both I and this girl were trying to help him. However, I noticed that he was clinging onto her more, and at one point, he pushed me away from him. My friends all told me that it seemed like he was getting handsy with this girl while he was drunk, and I agreed with them. The next morning, I talked to him about it and he swore up and down that he was done going to frat parties and parties in general unless I was there. \n\nFor the third time that day, he broke his word to me. I was so torn up that I started sobbing in front of all of my friends. I honestly assumed that he would be drunk and cheating on me. I told my friends this, and they bought an uber and took me to the frat he was at. When we got there, I saw him in front of the frat because the fire alarm just got pulled, so a whole crowd of people that were inside formed in front of the street. \n\nI was scared to go up to him for some reason, but I did. I started walking toward him with one of my friends, and he just looked at me dumbfounded. Then, in the next few seconds, he turned to his group of friends and said, \"Let's go.\" As if I was nothing to him. I requested to talk to him in private, and I confronted him and asked if he was drinking and if he made out with any girls (in the past, before we started dating, he had a reputation for getting drunk and making out with as many girls as he could at parties). He said no and basically got mad that I accused him of cheating. \n\nWe walked back to our apartment complex (we live in the same building) and we argued, and he said that he would try to change. But this isn't the first time he's lied to me, and we've had the same discussion before. I don't know how I could trust him anymore. This was all on Friday. Since Friday, I came home for the weekend to spend time with my dad and dog, and he texted me that he wants to get better and be a better boyfriend and that he loves me. However, it feels like he's said this same thing every time I catch him lying to me. \n\nI have no idea what to do. I've invested so much time and effort into this person. I'm not perfect either, obviously, but I don't know if I can stay in a relationship where I can't even be certain that he's not cheating on me or that he wouldn't cheat on me if things get hard in our relationship. He broke my heart, and I don't know if I can get over it.

When we first met at my friends graduation party, I didn\u2019t think much of him. However, we soon started hanging out after he invited me on a dope camping trip, It was our first date and he blew my mind, took me on my first motorcycle ride, brought a grill, my favorite cookout food and my favorite wine. It was beautiful. He thought of everything and even set up a tent.\n\nWe texted on and off but our relationship became official about 4 months ago. He opened up really quick about his exes and past relationships. Basically to sum it up, most of his exes used him for money, basically ate his finances up and eventually cheated on him. Or at least that is what he has told me! So, going into the relationship very early on he expressed how different I was from other girls he dated I guess it\u2019s because I never asked him for a dime. He loved my family values and the fact that I was raised in a two parent Christian household. He wants a life partner, as do I, we both want children and a strong family unit. This is what we bond over. \n\nHe is the perfect gentlemen. Always paying for dates, cooks for me and brings me snacks in bed, very reassuring and romantic. Almost everything a girl could want right? But he\u2019s also extremely sensitive, a little insecure and jealous. There have been numerous times he randomly accuses me of cheating and \u201cplaying with him.\u201d \n\nI recently went to South Africa and there\u2019s a thing called \u201cload shedding\u201d where for 6-8 hours there\u2019s no power at our campsites, or anywhere in general. I told him the first night, there might be a night or two I cannot contact him (I am in a whole different country, with no data or WiFi) but , I reassured him I would call him within the next available time frame where I have WiFi. He agreed & said \u201cdon\u2019t worry baby, I trust you.\u201d His words exactly. But he didn\u2019t mean it.\n\nThe second night, I spent at a different camp than the first (the first had WiFi, so I FaceTimed him as soon as I got there). I was a little worried and sad because I wouldn\u2019t get to call him or text him goodnight but I never thought what would happen the next morning I called him. \n\nThe next day we stopped at a brunch spot (with wifi) and I immediately tried to contact him , he gets upset and asks why I didn\u2019t answer his phone calls and ends up accusing me of \u201cMessing around\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, but I\u2019m gonna find out\u201d. I didn\u2019t understand why he was so angry. I\u2019m in S.A with 4 of my friends, I don\u2019t know anyone here , it\u2019s not like I\u2019m on a girls trip in Miami or something, and doing wild stuff. I\u2019m literally at campsites exploring nature, looking at wild animals and visiting landmarks. \n\nThe next incident happened a few weeks ago. I started a new job where out uniform is all black (Black shirt, black pants and black shoes). I was driving to his house from work to visit him. It was late at night and I agreed to visit him before his flight to ATL the next morning (I didn\u2019t want to at first because I was super tired & it didn\u2019t make sense to see him for 6\/7 hours only to go home. But, he made me feel guilty and I ended up going anyway. I expressed to him I was tired and uncomfortable because I was wearing a waist trainer for work. He immediately got upset and asked me why do I wear a waist trainer for work \u201caround other men, who don\u2019t do sh** for you.\u201d His words, and not \u201caround your man, who you\u2019re supposed to only look good for.\u201d I was so confused as to why this was even an argument\u2026 I got super defensive and just started apologizing even when it didn\u2019t make sense. I\u2019m looking back at this now and I\u2019m super mad at myself for letting him talk to me like that. \n\nOne thing about him is he gets over stuff fast. As long as I apologize and reassure him everything is ok and I\u2019m not trying to hurt him, he lets go of it and we move on. He doesn\u2019t linger on anything but I fear he will use it against me in the future. \n\nNow, I wanted to ask you guys. Do you think there is any hope for us, should I be more patient and reassuring with him or should I go off on my own?

I asked for some space and went to stay with my parents for the past few days.\n\nBesides this Dave and I have never had any issues, a few fights here and there but nothing we couldn\u2019t get past together. \n\nWhilst looks aren\u2019t the biggest thing, his message made me doubt whether I\u2019d be an idiot going back to him or if I should go the other way. \n\nI hope this is enough information as I\u2019ve never posted before and any advise is appreciated.\n\nEdit to add : I apologised for snooping when I talked to him after work and we\u2019re past it and he was understandably upset but that\u2019s something we were able to get past. \n\nThanks for everyone\u2019s input so far it\u2019s been helpful and I think I\u2019ll talk to him with all of your comments in mind.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1678527692.0},{"title":"how to know if you still love someone? me F20 and my boyfriend M21 had some serious problems","author":"blazmih","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11pw49o\/how_to_know_if_you_still_love_someone_me_f20_and\/","text":"Me F(20) and my boyfriend M(21) have been dating for over 2 years to be precise 2 years and 3 months.

I know when he was younger he struggled with drug abuse, but I thought those issues were behind him. \n\nA few weeks ago I found a suspicious text pop up on his phone, so I looked through the conversation. It was with an unsaved number and the texts were pretty dry, just \u201cHey man\u201d and setting up times to meet. I was alarmed by a text my boyfriend sent that said \u201cJust come upstairs the door is unlocked\u201d so I confronted him.\n\nMy boyfriend said he was a friend he met from work.

It ended up being an all day thing starting with coffee, lunch and ending with a movie. She was quite talkative and overall the date was going well, but a few things did stand out to me. She brought up the topic of sex very quickly, and overall seemed to be moving things very fast. For reference, we met on tinder but she made it clear she's looking for something serious, so her being so physical and bringing up sex so fast felt off. Due to that behavior I got an almost clingy vibe from her, but I chalked it up to first impressions and thought maybe she was nervous.\n\nTowards the end of the date I walked her to her car, and she suggested we see each other the next weekend. She mentioned how this was one of the better dates she's been on, and that she usually gets ghosted or rejected after the first date. I said it's an unfortunate reality of online dating, but I'd be down to hang again.\n\nI texted her last night, and she texted me back this morning. I've been busy with errands, and had to hop on work to organize some data (I work in tech), so I haven't had time to text.\n\nNow this is where it gets weird and I just can't shake this uneasy feeling. In the afternoon while I was working I got a call from a 'No Caller ID' number. I picked up and didn't say anything assuming it was a bot, but I could hear voices in the background. I said 'hello?' and the caller immediately hung up. Then she texted me once more a few hours later but I was still working, maybe 20 minutes after that text I got *another* blocked call. I answered the same way, waited and then said hello. I heard a soft voice that almost sounded startled but the caller hung up too fast for me to recognize the voice.\n\nI never get calls from blocked numbers, if it is a scammer or a bot, usually the number isn't blocked or my phone let's me know it's a likely scam call. Since I've been busy all day and still haven't gotten back to her, I'm wondering if she thinks I'm ghosting her (which wasn't my intention). But after the first date, if she's doing something like this, I'm honestly not comfortable seeing her again. And something in my gut just tells me it's her. If it is her, it feels like obsessive behavior that I'm not at all down with. I'm also concerned what else this type of person my do if I did let her into my life.\n\nI could ask her, but that would feel weird to me and of course she could deny it lol. What do you guys think? Do you think she may be calling me to see if I'm near my phone and not texting her back? I hate ghosting, but if she's doing this, it almost feels like borderline stalker behavior and I'm more than happy to just disappear.\n\nTLDR; I (30M) went on a date with someone (25F). She texted me this morning, but I haven't had time to text today, and I received two blocked calls with voices in the background, the second one shortly after one of her texts. My gut tells me it's her checking to see if I'm at my phone. She seemed a bit obsessive\/moving things fast on the date, so I'm concerned it might be her. What do you guys think?\n\nEDIT: I also find it odd that this would suddenly start coincidentally happening the day after our date.

We have both made mistake but is it better to deal this the pain and move on or should you stick around because of the time put in?\n\nI\u2019ll start off with my life. I (F21) grew up in a very strict household I wasn\u2019t allowed to have friends\/go outside\/buy clothes I liked cuz my father thought everyone was out to get me, it was tough and I was such a rebellious kid. Anyways fast forward a few years, my father sexually assaulted me around 12\/13 years\u2026 (I don\u2019t think I\u2019m gonna go into details rn) and that put a big ideology of what pleasure, sex and love is into my head because my mum was devoted to my dad. They had their issues but they found each other and in a culture where parents chose partners for their child, my parents fought for the love they had. I never told my mum what happened to me because it would break her heart so I suffered with it.\n\nI started drinking when I was 13 and I was pretty good at hiding it; also when I was younger I got bullied a lot cuz my complexion was much darker and I was a chubby kid. All of this led me to seek validation from boys\/men. At 15\/16 I got my 1st bf and I lost my virginity, it made me feel numb I just remember thinking oh I cant wait for this to be over. I had loads of friends asking me for advice and looking up to me as though I was cool. My 1st bf ended up cheating on me and thats when it all started. I was in so many relationships after him I never loved anyone and I couldn\u2019t stay in a rs for more than 6-8mths. My drinking just got worse I was even drunk in class. Again I had people look up to me saying I was a heart breaker thats when I felt like people actually cared about what I said cuz I did everything a 14-17yrs old actually wanted to do. So I stuck it out being the quiet and innocent girl in front of adults but a daredevil and rebellious girl with friends.\n\nBy this time things had gotten really bad in my household, I was being physically and emotionally abused. On my 17th bday, (long story short) I ran away from home after being hit over an insignificant problem. Police were informed and contacted me while I was at my best friends house. After finally returning home, my parents realised I had people that looked out for me so they picked up everything and left the town where we had stayed for 9 years to a place where I had no one and they had friends that could keep an eye on me. I had such a hard time settling in since I moved midway through the academic year and it was a completely different place. I had no friends, I was drinking worse than ever, I smoked weed and started smoking cigarettes regularly too. It got to a point where one day my parents hit me so bad I tried to cut myself and tried to jump out of the window in front of them. My dad stopped me and I remember while he choked me and held half my body out of the window my mum was crying saying we have a son don\u2019t do anything stupid. I just had to move out and I did (which was so difficult, the police were involved; my mum was taken into jail for a night and idk how my dad evaded it but then she was released and I lived with them for 3 mths while I secretly moved most of my things to a hostel). After moving out I had difficulties sleeping, constant nightmares about being choked and sexually assaulted. I would literally sleep for 2-4 hours because I was scared about what would happen if I wasn\u2019t conscious to fight my thoughts and struggled for air\u2026 it was all too real at the time\n\nDuring this, I met a guy (now M20) and I was still holding out on relationships. I just felt like I could never commit and I thought this was going to be one of those. But he, although talking to many girls online, has never been in a committed \/ sexual rs. And hearing about my love life he didn\u2019t think he would want to be with me after I had been with many people. But for me it was about validation, it was that I could get him if I wanted to and while I was trying to make him want to be with me\u2026 I was slowly falling in love with him, my drinking got better and the nightmares started to go away. For 6 months we were just dating, he was the first guy I told about my dad and my childhood. I was so emotionally attached to him, I asked him out and we were together. This was the 1st ever guy I said I love you too where I actually meant it. But during the course of our rs I saw he was brought up completely differently. He had such a relaxed upbringing, he never did chores around the house, his mum cleaned his mess, he has never cooked and he has never had to care about what other people in his family thought. For him his family didn\u2019t care what he wanted to study or if he got the best grades as long as he can make enough money to live, for me my parents were the \u2018where did the 1% go when you get 99%\u2019 . He\u2019s never had to work hard a day in his life.\n\nAfter the couple months we were together I was just using his phone watching yt and there was notifications from other girls he was talking to\u2026 it broke my heart and I talked to him about it\u2026 and he apologised. But one thing I noticed was if he were to do something wrong he would never understand but if I switched the story and said what if it was me doing this, what would you do? I would get an angry, shitty response. But I stuck with this rs for 2 and a half years with so many episodes of my crying and cutting (where in some situations he did know and in others he didn\u2019t). Then started the weed\u2026 he was smoking weed continuously and then gaslighting me about it when I asked. I thought I was being paranoid and a bitch until I heard and saw the proof. He continuously lied to me whilst apologising and saying he would change. I tried to break up with him cuz it was getting so bad but he threatened to kill himself and I had to travel to him whilst sick to make sure he wasn\u2019t going to take his own life. I finally did break up with him, although it was hard I just focused on college and getting my grades for med school.\n\nAll hell breaks loose\u2026 After not being in contact with my parents from when I was 17 to nearly 19, I slowly started talking with my mum. We got closed and I started going to visit my family for the holidays. Me and my dad never talked but I was happy to be close to my mum and little brother. Everything was alright for some time: me and most of my family were okay, I was moving on from my ex slowly and I was focusing on getting to my future career. April 2022, I get a call from my brother that my mum\u2019s been in an accident and to come home. It was late in the evening and the only person I knew that had a car that could get me there asap was my ex. I called him and he picked me up. When I got in all I could smell was weed\u2026 I didn\u2019t even know if he was high or not while the car was drifting side to side but I needed to go to my parents\u2019 so I didn\u2019t care. I called on God praying everything was going to be ok, and we arrived just in time whilst my mum was being pulled into the ambulance. I remember the eye contact and her shocked face and I said \u201cmum everything is going to be okay, I love you, okay? I love you don\u2019t worry I\u2019ll be there soon\u201d. But after a month in hospital my mum died\u2026 it broke my heart I just don\u2019t know how to deal with pain like that. I just felt so much regret because I was supposed to go over there on the weekend before this happened and maybe if I was there I could have saved my mum. and I hate my father even more now because I know he could have done more. I know my mum and him had a fight on the day and I keep thinking if he hadn\u2019t been the bastard he was maybe my mum would have been more attentive to her surroundings and that fire would have never happened and she would be alive right now.\n\nAfter she died I really needed that support from my ex, we were back together though not explicitly said. But a week and a bit after my mum had died he was still acting so weird, he smelt like weed all the time and the amnesia was so bad so I confronted him calmly and he started shouting and being defensive. I remember telling him \u201cI really cannot be asked for this, I lost my mum just over a week ago I cant bear to have you yelling at me bcuz its just making me want to cry\u201d. The next moment he said \u201cyou are just using your mum\u2019s death as an excuse\u201d. I cannot put it into words the rage and pain and everything I felt. I hated him in that moment I asked him to get out of my house and he wouldn\u2019t leave. I had to leave my house so I wouldn\u2019t hurt myself or scream after being cornered. more than an hour of sitting outside, I went back into the flat and thank God he was gone.\n\nI literally had my final exams the month after so I didn\u2019t even get to process the death or the break up. After the exams I was drunk every single day, I was working as a bartender and it was perfect I could be drunk ever shift and no one knew. I had this close male family friend being friendly and talking to me he really helped me to forget about my mum but slowly slowly he was trying to be intimate with me. I didn\u2019t even care I just needed to not feel the loss of my mum. Every single time I could feel logical normal thinking or pain I would drink. I slept with a couple of people but I felt no love or care I just felt numb, just mechanical thoughts of this is what people do when they have sex. I never thought I would feel love and I never thought I could feel happiness. Also thought this is it with my ex bf I would never be with him again\u2026\n\nMy ex and I had an airline ticket credit which was deposited during covid and it was on my account, so I messaged him to send it to him. We started talking slowly. Although I could never again see him the same way as I did in my life I did miss him and I told him we should be just friends. We didn\u2019t do that. We were having sex and he stayed over and we started dating again. I fight everyday with my internal thoughts of how I could betray my mum\u2019s death by being with him after that much disrespect.  One day he was on my iPad to watch Netflix ad he saw messages during the course of summer where I had been intimate with a guy who I had introduced to him while we were together. This guy was my family friend (I previously talked about )and I was only ever that to him and after I moved out we talked just as friends and I introduced him to my boyfriend and they bonded over cars. But after we broke up and we started to hangout he was flirting and moving to me. Although we never had sex we did kiss and do other things\u2026 and I told my boyfriend the things that happened over summer\u2026\n\nHe told me he couldn\u2019t look at me the same way again because me being with other people before him was understandable but me being with other people after him was betrayal. Every time we talk about it now he says what you did is different to what I did. You were with other men how could you do that after you met me. And I would proceed to tell him I could compartmentalise my pleasure\/ pain\/ love and comfort. That I was used to feeling numb over meaningless sex mixed with alcohol. He says he can\u2019t believe it that I could cause him this much pain and he\u2019s getting nightmares about me and he should have sex with someone else so maybe his nightmares can go away.\n\nHe\u2019s a guy where his views on women and the way they live their lives is fucked up. And every time I tell him about the years of pain I felt whilst with him, he says it will never be comparable to the pain caused of what I did and that will always be worse. I was never with him when I had sex with 1 other stranger who I didn\u2019t love or care about. I kissed 3 other random people even then I was hammered I don\u2019t remember what happened properly or who they were I just wanted to feel comforted and forget my sadness. I wanted to feel anything other than the loss. When I was sober I would literally cringe about it and smack my head trying to forget and I would drink straight away so I could go back to my nonchalant self. All of summer was a blur\u2026\n\nHim and I have been talking about it now and he says he doesn\u2019t know if he can get over me being with other people after our break up, he\u2019s even more jealous when people talk to me, I\u2019m not allowed to have guy friends (which is understandable but he gets pissed even if a male classmate talks to me), he\u2019s thinking about having sex with someone else so we can \u2018be even\u2019 and he thinks what the mistakes I made although I was in a shit time was just an excuse and is never as bad as the mistakes he made.\n\nI just want advice. I wanna know what people think. I wanna hear stories of people who\u2019ve had similar situations. I\u2018m finding it hard to walk away because i cant lose this either. I really appreciate it.

I don't expect to find support or anything like that here, but I just wanted to vent and get some opinions, because my head is a mess and time is passing and I don't know what to do...\n\nWell, I've been living with my boyfriend for 4 years (everyone thinks we're married). Our relationship was quite turbulent at first because he wanted to be free and I ended up getting attached to him while he was still with others... Then, we started to get serious, and he even dated others during that time. After some back and forth, we decided to officially commit to the relationship, and things got better. We dated for 3 years before moving in together.\n\nWe also have a considerable age difference (10 years), and he was my first. Our relationship, in general, is very peaceful, no fights, no jealousy, a lot of companionship and friendship (sometimes even too much friendship). Throughout these years, I have always trusted him very much, and I have never looked at his phone or anything... Another important point is that sex has never been that great for me, you know?! At first, it was good, but since I had no parameter because he was my first, I had no way to compare... But with the routine, work, stress, the rhythm slowed down a lot because most of the time, I didn't have the energy. And whenever it happened, I ended up getting frustrated because I didn't find it that good, and therefore I didn't even try... We have never been able to talk to each other about these things that bothered us, and the frequency decreased even more.\n\nIt happens that lately, I started to notice other men and feel desire, something that I no longer feel with my boyfriend, I try to look at him and feel like having sex, but I don't have it. :(\n\nSo, here's the point: I looked at his phone for the first time in years and found many reactions and responses to stories hitting on women, the responses varied from 2 months ago to 3 years ago (that is, almost the time we moved in together). His Instagram only has women, he likes a lot all the time, but I didn't find anything beyond that. This made me think that during that time, he must have cheated on me, but he probably deleted the most incriminating messages... When I read that, I kind of didn't feel much, I didn't feel jealous, I didn't feel angry, I just felt empty knowing that all the time I was trusting him, and he was doing this right under my nose, being cynical all this time... Then I tried to reflect if I still liked him or not. I couldn't come to a conclusion. I called him to talk, and he said it was something stupid he shouldn't have done, but he noticed that we both were getting distant, we weren't having sex anymore, we didn't have that desire for each other anymore (which I agree and understand), and we talked a lot, and we decided to continue the relationship and try to fix what is bothering us.\n\nTwo months have passed, and I still have a crazy desire for other men, the desire to have sex always, but not necessarily with him. Our sex life improved after that, but I feel like something is missing.\nHere comes the worst part.\nI started to notice something about one of my friends, during the last few weeks, whenever we go out, he catches me exchanging looks with him. Then, last week, our conversations on WhatsApp went to another level after I came back from a night out slightly drunk and he was too. He ended up kind of inviting me to his place and I said that I couldn't, but then the conversation turned to the fact that he wanted me and I ended up saying that I wanted him too. Since then, we've been talking almost every day and every now and then the topic of when we'll be able to meet up to fulfill our desire comes up. (I don't intend to actually do it, but I'm really tempted)\n\nI'm feeling terrible because I'm doing worse than what my boyfriend did to me and I'm already kind of cheating on him. I'm thinking about ending everything, but I'm in a dilemma that it's not worth destroying a relationship because of a momentary desire, after everything we've been through together. We've built so much together and I don't want to destroy it.\n\nBut then I think that he didn't think twice about doing what he did during these years and didn't feel guilty until I found out. Then I try to justify that I should cheat as a form of revenge, which I don't agree with...\n\nAnyway, my mind is really confused, I don't know if I still love him as before, I feel a huge affection and friendship, but I still remember what he did, the trust and, in a way, the respect was broken. And now I'm doing the same.\n\nI can't control the desire that I'm feeling for this friend of mine, every time I see him I'm getting shaken. I should cut this off soon but the feeling is so good. I'm a horrible human being. :(","upvote_ratio":0.4,"created_utc":1678668936.0},{"title":"i need a flirty clever answer M22 F21","author":"Altruistic-Seat9814","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11pvft9\/i_need_a_flirty_clever_answer_m22_f21\/","text":"I\u2019m talking to a girl on instagram, basically I said her lips on her stories were giving me ideas, she taunted me into saying what I was thinking and said she will think about it, probably a shit test or something, since it\u2019s a flirty conversation but I HAVE NO IDEIA how to answer this, pls help","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678668865.0},{"title":"F35 and M39 married for 5 years.","author":"Positive-Flamingo-19","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11ppw7c\/f35_and_m39_married_for_5_years\/","text":"Time and time again, when my husband and I fight, I want to get a divorce.

She always initiated in the most adolescent way and felt that talking seductively or chasing was awkward for her. So, I had become accustomed to that and am trying hard to break it. \n\nLong story short - I need some help relearning how to chase and build anticipation. She loves waking up cuddled up with me. Our physical touch in a non-sexual way but very loving couple way is intense. When we have sex, we\u2019re on and it\u2019s always very good. \n\nThis women deserves the world.

In my opinion there\u2019s no way he didn\u2019t know it was my birthday, that day. \n\nFor context my brother is 8 years older than me, so he was an only child living with only my mother before I was born. When I was a preteen growing up, me and my brother were good friends, we shared interests, movies suggestions, music etc. We also had a mutual friend group. In that group was one of my brothers friends, who ended up being my first boyfriend. When that guy eventually broke up with me, it was not an easy breakup, he admitted to cheating on me and it was very dramatic, and my brother in turn afterwards decided to choose the friend group over the friendship with me, and I was completely removed from the friend group. My brother then moved to texas for 8 years and only came back to this state in 2020. \n\n\nFlash forward to March 10th, 2023, it is my 24th birthday. Up until that day my brother had been working on moving out respectfully. Also not very humbly, bragging about his new apartment and new car, and how his friends - my old friends - are moving into this apartment with him. \n\nHe decided that day, was the day he was going to have every single friend of his, from our old friend group come into the house for the *entire day* and moved all his heavy furniture out one by one. I in turn, was mostly stuck in my room all day because not only do I not want to be around that group of people, but it was also a blizzard outside that day. It being a blizzard is one of the reasons, why it\u2019s obviously an odd choice to choose that day to have all his friends come over and move furniture. It was mostly odd because up until then he did not have any of these friends over, understandably I believed it was just to be respectful of my history with them, but him making the choice to invite them *all* over on my birthday really did strike me as some kind of spiteful choice towards me. \n\nTL;DR - Basically in short I did not do much on my birthday but make way for my brother to move out furniture, and for all our old friends to come into the house.

I always had a crush on her, but I was genuinely friends with her at the same time. Her family wasn't too fond of her being friends with me because her father was very judgemental (he's White and didn't want his daughter hanging around Latinos + I am Latino).\n\nNot only that, her father is very judgmental towards people like me becauss not only my race. But also because I have a lot of tattoos around my body. Long story short. There was a huge fire due to a gas leak in their house. I was over at her place and I was going home , but she called me back panicked because there was a fire.\n\nShe amd the rest of her family got out but her dad was stuck in their house and she and her mother couldn't go back so I had turned back around. I took a lot of physical pain to help her father because I went in and helped her father out through a window. I got burns all over my body and I had some very bad cuts that left nasty scars when I broke the window. I was able to recover, but the scars still hurt and it was the worst thing I had ever physically gone through.\n\nAfter that incident, her dad completely chamged his attitude about me and now he likes me. We get together I'd say daily to have a coffee in the morning, or to grab some lunch. Not only that, we started traveling together and he treats me like a son now and he told me that he would very much want me as his son in law and he said he'd like a guy like me for his daughter.\n\nNow, I have respected my best friends boundaries after she rejected me like a year back. She said she wasn't ready to start dating seriously, but she texted me and asked if I could go on a date with her. She planned a whole weekend away for us and this is what I've wanted with her. The thing is I don't know if it's genuine because she only asked me out after the incident with her dad. \n\nI don't want her to feel like she owes me anything because she doesn't and I want her to be with me because of genuine interest, not because I helped save her father. I don't know whether or not I should even bring this conversation up to her because I don't want to look or be disrespectful.

I have an epileptic dog that requires special attention so I have to be home frequently, otherwise I would come to her as well (she's very understanding about this and we only live 10 minutes away from each other). After covid, I began working again in the music industry in LA doing various production, songwriting, and engineering gigs, and my schedule became much more taxing, but we still made it work. We virtually never had a fight until about 4 months ago when she got particularly upset with me for being late to one of her friend's birthday parties, where she shared with me that she felt that I have not been making a good enough effort to better integrate with her friends (I get along with her friends great, but did not make it a priority to become better friends with them as I am currently very career focused). It wasn't until then that I truly realized how important this was to her and how I had not been listening to her, and had been making a better effort to hangout with them since. Around that same time, I had been feeling like our schedules were getting pretty hard to manage, as we were only seeing each other 1-2 days a week. This had been tough for me to handle as I am a pretty sexual person and feel that I have a lot more sexual needs than her, but overall the reduction in quality time together had been tough for both of us as it put a lot of pressure for us to make that time special when we did see each other. I had a roommate move out of the house I live in, which was the first time her and I opened up a dialogue about the prospects of moving in together. She quickly rejected this idea, as she does not want to have roommates again and feels she needs to take advantage of the years that she is young and does not have kids. She fears that moving in would require her to look after my dog frequently when I'm gone, which wouldn't allow her to do things like go out with her friends, travel, etc. She was open to this in the future, but it would realistically take years for us to earn enough money to afford a place that would suit her and I's needs.\n\nThe other night we got to go to a mutual friend's birthday celebration, but did not get to spend a lot of quality time together and then I had to leave early the next morning. We both felt like something was off, and I started to feel that I had a lot I needed to get off my chest. We met to talk a few days after when we were both free, and I began explaining things that I have been having a hard time with in the relationship, but before I could begin she cut me off and told me she had been feeling some things as well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's the **TLDR**. **She felt that:**\n\n**- We both have very different goals at the moment (mine career based, her wanting to take advantage of her youth while she can)**\n\n**- The time that we have been spending has not been quality time (she feels that we have often just been staying in rather than doing something special, which I agreed)**\n\n**- She feels that we like different things (she really appreciates nice dinners and going out to bars, I like staying in and playing games with friends)**\n\n**I told her that I felt that:**\n\n**- I was having a tough time seeing growth in the relationship**\n\n**- Her love was conditional (she wouldn't be willing to make sacrifices and live together as she wants to take advantage of the years she has when she's young)**\n\n**- She does a bad job when it comes to discussing our emotions (told her I was feeling depressed a few months ago, and she kind of disregarded it and never checked in on me again)**\n\nShe told me she agreed she did a bad job checking in on me when I opened up about my depression, and she said at the time she was upset because I brought it up while we were at a nice dinner. I got very upset at this response and after a long silence told her that I thought our best next course of action would be to spend some time away from each other. It's been 5 days since and it's been really hard, just can't stop crying and missing how we used to be. I think we'll need to have a follow up soon, but I really have no idea how to go forward or whether we should stay together or not.

Here is a breakdown of our relationship timeline, the issues we've faced and what has now resurfaced. \n\nMonths 1-6: great. Either no red flags, or was too infatuated to see them.\n\nMonths 6-9: moved in together. Rough patches, some arguments and hard talks, but figured I'd keep working through it. All related to her jealousy and FOMO.\n\nMonths 9-12: considered the first breakup the entire time. Her jealousy, FOMO, and selfishness led me to the first breakup. It was hard to have any \"me\" time or do any traveling because she would get jealous and just start talking about how much her life sucks or something.\n\nFast forward a couple months later. We never cut contact, and we fell for each other again. I didn't handle the relationship as well as I could have the first time around, and neither did she. We both elected to change and give it another go.\n\nMy girlfriend struggles with jealousy, FOMO, anxiety, and has some abandonment issues amongst other things. I have been trying to be the very best boyfriend I can be. I'm encouraging open communication, and trying to get her to stop being so afraid of me leaving her so she can open up to me more. This approach was working fairly well, with some small hiccups, and we were beginning to plan our life together again, until a major roadblock the other night.\n\nHere's what happened. I'm away on a work trip for 3 days, and I posted a silly Facebook memory from 12 years ago. Keep in mind, I was 13 years old at the time. The post was written in that cringy uWu type language and it was along the lines of \"this is (female), I love you (name) you are the fucking best!\", but again in really cringy language. I thought it was hilarious we used to type like that and figured I'd spread some good ol cringe for everyone. Later that night I'm on the phone with my girlfriend and she asks me why I posted that and asks me to delete it. I had to ask her... How deep rooted are these insecurities that you are jealous\/upset over a post from 12 YEARS AGO when I was literally THIRTEEN?? I immediately felt like she had undone everything I've been trying to do; encourage trust, get her guard down, get her to trust that I'm with her and only her and I'm sticking this out. I've been putting so much work in. I've been reading books and articles about attachment styles, how to work out common relationship problems etc. I've been communicating, I've been on alert for when something is up with her so I can get it out of her before she starts bottling up again. I've become more tender, and paid attention during talks to make sure I'm being a good listener and making sure she feels heard. It has been a great growing experience for me.\n\nI have been trying so fucking hard. I've modified my work schedule to work with hers better, I haven't been doing any traveling outside of work (except with her), I've been doing everything I can to make her feel secure in me and this simple thing just blew it wide open all over again. It makes me think that, despite her pledge to change, nothing has changed in the slightest and she is just masking. I love her, but I am questioning if she needs to be in a relationship with a therapist instead of a person, because bringing this stuff to a relationship with anyone is very unfair. I've blown a lot of money on travel and cool experiences trying to make a point that she is my woman and we're gonna have an awesome life together. I feel like my work has been undone. She is jealous of my job, my money, and my experiences in life that she deems \"cooler\" than hers. What am I left to do, Reddit?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Girlfriend has severe FOMO, anxiety, jealousy. Went through breakup once. Ironed out the communication issues and things we both did wrong the first time and gave it a second go. Things were great until she asked me to delete a Facebook post I shared from 12 years ago with some stupid cringy language that some friend-girl at the time wrote on my profile. Been working so hard to be the best boyfriend I can, but despite that I'm worried her anxiety\/jealousy issues are unfixable and I can't live like this.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678666991.0},{"title":"My (18M) GF (19F) lied to me and made up a group of people just to make me jealous and now I don't know what to do.","author":"UnlikelyStage5524","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11pupdn\/my_18m_gf_19f_lied_to_me_and_made_up_a_group_of\/","text":" \n\nOk, I\u2019ll try to explain this as clearly as possible.

A few years later, in mid-2021 or so, someone called \u201cAndrea\u201d talked to me on Instagram, saying that she was X best friend and that she had talked about me with her, and that she wanted to know who I was,\n\nwe became friends, and Andrea then talked to X and told her that I was a good person, then X unblocked me and we started talking again, Andrea then told me that X had a relationship with a guy called Y, and then X confirmed me this information, and in the time we talked she even sensed me some screenshots where he posted some stories of them holding hands, then we had another argument about other topics and both Andrea and X blocked me again. In march 2022 I talked again with X because we saw each other at college, and sometimes talked to me about this guy called \u00c1ngel, who was her best friend for a long time and that was also friends with Y.\n\nSome time passed and X and I started dating, one day she told me that she needed to confess something, that she and a friend of hers created the IG account of Andrea, and that she did not exist, I was confused and didn\u2019t think much about it. Time passed and another thing happened, she once told me to text her mother on her phone, and when I did it I realized there was no conversation with Angel (she and I are really open about our stuff, and neither of us has any problems with taking the other one phone and do something) when I asked her about it she told me that she stopped talking to Angel because the other day in a party, Y was talking bad things about X and that he believed him, so when X heard about it she got mad at him so she deleted all his contact information from her phone. She really seemed depressed about it so I didn't ask anything else.\n\nBut yesterday, she told me that both Y and Angel were also made up of people that she created. she told me that when we were friends she wanted to make me jealous so she created Y's account and Andrea's to make me talk to her and then make me jealous. but when we saw each other in 2022 she didn't want me to know Y was a made-up person so she then invented Angel to give more credibility to her story. I don't know how to react to this, because it really looked like she was telling me the truth about those things, and I never doubted it.

I didn\u2019t notice him at first but the more I saw him around the hotel or in the lobby I began to recognize him more.\n\nI was sitting on the lobby sofas one day waiting for my friends to come down so we could go out for lunch but to no avail they never came so I just sat there on my phone watching youtube. I was facing the entrance when he came through, I remember looking up and him looking directly at me and coming right over talking to me as if we\u2019d known each other. I had never talked to him before and was caught off guard. I assumed he was from my school as my college has campuses all over my state, so I didn\u2019t get a chance to meet everyone.\n\nI smiled at him and greeted him back. He sat down right next to me which I didn\u2019t expect, and he placed his box which I presumed was food on the coffee table in front of us and sort of relaxed right next to me. He asked me how my day was, and I responded with \u201cIt\u2019s going okay.\u201d He laughed a little and said \u201creally?\u201d and I kind of scoffed nervously not knowing what else to say. He then pulled two Dr. Pepper\u2019s out of his pockets one a can and the other a plastic bottle. He offered me one and I hesitantly declined. I was going to accept but I didn\u2019t know if he was messing around me with me so instead, I just said no. He then asked for a second time \u201cHow my day was going?\u201d\n\nI assumed he was trying to make the awkward tension go away but if there\u2019s anything I\u2019m good at it\u2019s my lack of speaking, nervous laughter, and ability to make a situation more awkward so I just responded with \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it could be better.\u201d And I asked him the same question back but completely blanked and forgot to listen.\n\nHe turned his head to ask someone a question who was on the computers that were also placed in the lobby next to us and then he stood up to check one of the other computers. I took this as my chance to walk away because I presumed the conversation was over.\n\nI spent a majority of my time in the hotel lobby at the large tables they have to work on my presentations for the conference since I didn't like staying in my room constantly. So, I began to see him more frequently lingering around. There were a couple of times where he would stare at me as if wanting to say something, but I didn\u2019t really think too much about it so went about my day. There was another time where I was sitting at the sofas, and he directly sat on the ones right behind me faced the opposite. He was talking to his friends, and I didn\u2019t want to hover over them and have them thinking I was listening, so I just got up and left.\n\nThe last day and a half, I saw him lingering around the place I would study at in the lobby and didn\u2019t think too much of it. I was pretty busy; I think we all were considering it was the last day of the conference and there was a banquet for our achievements.\n\nAnyways, I decided to dress up and after the event I returned to my hotel and saw him at the lobby again. I smiled at him as I was passing and received notice from my coach who told me we would be packing up that night to leave at 4 am the following morning to return home so I went straight up to my room to pack. I changed into my pajamas and came back down to take my stuff out to the vans. I saw him one last time near the computers and exited the hotel for a while.\n\nAfter I finished packing away my stuff in the van, I returned to the lobby to meet with my coaches and colleagues talking about our departure and return home.\n\nI was twirling on my seat next to the computers listening to my coaches when I noticed a notepad on the desk I was at. There was a name and last name scribbled on it and I could only make out the first name.I scribbled on the notepad too and a few minutes later called it a night.\n\nThe next morning at 4am, my school and I left and made our way back home.\n\nTwo days ago, I was on the organization who hosted the conference\u2019s facebook page and came across a tag from one the colleges who had been there. There was a picture of him and the award he got that night at the banquet. Along with that I saw a comment under the post whose name was the same one I had noticed on the notepad I scribbled on: \u201cSpencer Dawson\u201d (fake name)\n\nI\u2019m currently connecting all the dots, but I feel like I\u2019m overthinking it.\n\nWhen I told my colleagues about the Dr. Pepper-Lobby happenstance they told me he was probably trying to talk to me more, but my quietness and short answers probably ruined it. They stated all the other times he was probably trying to approach me again, but I never gave the opportunity. Considering he had brought two sodas with him that day to the lobby and was ready to give one away. Yet, I rejected his offer.\n\nI didn\u2019t go into this conference thinking I would be interested in anyone. I say this because I went into this not caring about how I was going to be perceived by my race demographic since I have never been romantically interested in anyone who was the same as me in terms of culture\/identity.\n\nI didn\u2019t stand out, my clothes oversized, of course I still looked presentable.\n\nI didn't extend my effort into my appearance aside from my usual makeup and hair.\n\nI\u2019m also plus size so the odds of what I set myself up with were low in terms of someone liking me considering I wasn\u2019t dressing to impress.\n\nMy mindset was just to enjoy this city I was in, present what I came for, and return home. Nothing involving romance.\n\nI will say that I don\u2019t know if I like him but considering I found him easy on social media\u2026 if he likes me wouldn\u2019t he have sought me out already or am I just overthinking all of this?\n\nIt sounds ridiculous but I\u2019m oblivious to hints and I mean he could\u2019ve just been friendly to me but I\u2019m overthinking it, right? Or again, I\u2019m wrong so what would be the next step?\n\nWe live in the same state, go to different colleges. I don\u2019t plan on transferring for another year after I get my associates, so I don't know if its viable to attempt something. I wouldn't mind an LDR, my main problem is sorting out what to do in all of this. I know nothing about him besides what he presents online and the few in-person interactions we had.\n\nIf I'm being honest, I think I just wanted to know if he did like me.\n\nI'm curious as to why and what he had in mind if things had gone his way. The more I think about it the more I think about the \u2018what ifs.\u2019The guy is cute, but I never saw myself getting into a relationship or crushing on someone until my friends pointed all this out to me. I thought it was a funny story on my part having denied something they said was obvious.\n\nI'm kind of mad at myself for being so reserved or standoffish cause now I won't know unless I seek him out first which is funny in terms of how this even started.\n\nI find myself thinking about it constantly since I returned home. I know I can just add him on social media and see if he responds but I need other opinions on if all of what I presented here were hints or attempts at him liking me before I move forward.

I have certain boundaries when it comes to sex as I\u2019m still a virgin and I want to wait to be in a committed relationship where I feel safe, secure and comfortable. Now I did tell him this boundary the second time i went to his house after a make out session. He wanted me to sleep over and i told him I don\u2019t sleep with guys until I\u2019m in a committed relationship. \n\nWell the next week he is asking me again about sleeping over so I agree, naively thinking he still would respect my previous boundary of no sex. These are the only dates he is planning as well, just the ones at his house. When I brought up him coming to my place or doing something else he didn\u2019t really say anything. \n\nSo I agree to hangout with him, telling him I might be open to sleeping if I drink a bit too much. Which I ended up doing, we slept together in the same bed. Then he started getting very forward. I was half asleep and he was starting to finger my boobs and in my pants. He grabbed my hand and put it on his dick. I was nervous and knew I wanted to reiterate my boundaries but things kept moving and it wasn\u2019t until after he took my shirt off I finally told him I was waiting for sex, and I was a virgin, I also acknowledged i should have told him this earlier and he agreed. We get up and go eat breakfast and when I\u2019m about to leave, we makeout and he again puts my hand on his hard package again.\n\nHe\u2019s texted me since but has been very distant, one sentence replies. Im considering sending a text message basically apologizing, restating my boundaries, and saying if he wants to see where this goes to let me know and that I\u2019ll respect his decision either way. \nWhat are y\u2019all thoughts? Should I send the text or just give him space for now? I know I messed up with allowing certain things and then stopping, he has a right to be upset and I knew I should have said that much earlier and I should have never let myself get in the same bed with him. I think he would have respected me if I had said it. \nThank y\u2019all! \n\nTLDR: i told him my boundaries a few weeks ago, then agreed to a sleepover, but not sex. I kept allowing him to progress things on our sleepover until I finally spoke up.

I usually have no trouble keeping my libido down when I'm by myself, but as soon as I'm with her I can't help but go crazy over her, and It's frustrating to be rejected most of the time (though I can imagine that it must be frustrating to reject someone all the time aswell). I try to live with it but it gets harder and harder over time, and I'm not sure how much longer I can handle the difference in our libido.\n\nI talked to her and we're willing to work out a solution, but so far I'm clueless where to begin. I would do anything to decrease the Gap in our sex drives, also if it means I have to work on my libido, and somehow decrease it.\n\nWas someone in a similar situation?

It worries me greatly about how things are progressing. \n\nA little background: We have dated before(Four months) and we lost touch (as I work two full time jobs and go to school to push one job into a more in depth career. He was also working one full time and a part time job). We kept in touch but not in the romantic way. Friendly chat if we were selling something or looking to re-home a pet or something like that. We have only been intimate once(Few days before we lost touch) and I felt so uncomfortable afterwards, especially since I feel like he doesn't like my service dog (I'm mentally challenged, but not stupid). \n\nFlash forward to this Valentine's day: I sent a basic little digital valentine's day card to everyone on my FB messenger.  Naturally he got one as well, it wasn't anything mushy or thinks like that. It just had a anime girl and wished everyone a happy valentine's day. We ended up staying up all night (he took the night off work so we could text) talking and catching up. Then he asked me to give him another chance. That work won't get in the way this time and everything will be fine.\n\nThe part that I question everything: Last night I brought up that he seems to hate my little service dog (she's a Chihuahua and a cuddle bug if she knows and trusts you). I brought up how last time he was over at my house he kicked her out of my bedroom and when he wants me to sleep at his apartment I'd need to bring her with me. He went on a rant making excuses it seemed about how he doesn't like small dogs due to a bad experience, he kicked her out so he could have me alone, and doesn't want to hear her bark at his loud ass roommates when they walk around or for her to go potty on his floor(she's pad trained). I asked him if he could accept her and he said yes, but I don't believe him. \n\nHe also doesn't want to hang out at my home, he always wants to go to his house. I am allergic to a lot of things and even he says his room and apartment is a mess, so most likely I'd have to dope myself up on all my medications just to spend time at his house. We make plans to go out on date nights and stuff (like spending his birthday this week with each other), but everytime something came up or I've bailed because I'm not ready to see him just yet. He gets upset because my job is demanding(I am a private live in nurse who takes care of the disabled and dying. I work everyday and a day off has to be scheduled a week in advance) and I can't drop it to go out on the few days a week he is free(he works sunday-tuesday and is off the rest of the week). He also pretty much only claims to put up with his own friends, but they can apparently get him to go out and do stuff.\n\nWhen I do get free, I still pittle around my house or go up the street to my friends because if something happens it only takes one minute to get from their house to mine. He refuses to meet my friends. They have invited us to movies and game nights and nothing. He says he's not ready to meet my friends because he is 'unsocial' as he says. Yet he's had me meet his roommates and on the same night we got back together he asked me to meet his parents. \n\nHe doesn't have a good relationship with his folks or his sister. The only family member I hear good things about is his disabled little brother(21). He won't tell me their names or anything, just that when his parents die we will move into his parents house and inherit their 3 acres and guardianship of his little brother. I'm not a big fan of the incoming drama of his sister. She wants the house and land, but doesn't want to take responsibility for their brother because she won't be able to live a carefree life like she is now. Currently from what I'm told, she's part of a poly marriage and just lives with them. \n\nI told him I wanted to travel and see places in a few years, he said he can't because in a few years he'll have his own responsibilities (his brother). He said he doesn't want me to stop the idea of travel, but he plans to live around here for the rest of his life. \n\nI just don't know if it's me being paranoid or what. I've had a bad experience with relationships and serious issues reading social cues due to PTSD and ADHD.\n\nHelp? Please.

We don't live together, but own houses that are in the same neighborhood and are about 2.5 miles apart. (This is something we have discussed at length and neither of us feels ready to join households). He has never once spent the night at my house, and very rarely comes over to spend time together. It falls to me to go over to his place, and it's becoming exhausting to the point it feels like a chore. I've tried talking to him about this, but he's now using his cat allergies as an excuse to not spend any time at my house. (I only adopted the two cats a year ago, and before that there were other excuses such as he has all of his things at his house). I don't think I realized what an issue it was going to be as until recently I only worked part time. Currently I'm transitioning jobs and have gone from working 24hrs\/week to closer to 60hrs\/week. He's upset I don't have enough time for him, and that my sex drive has gone down. I tried explaining to him that this is temporary, but he says if I value the relationship I will make time for it. He also thinks it's unfair for me to ask for support(emotional) if l'm not prepared to support him(physical).\n\nNow this came to a head so to speak when two days ago one of my two cats went missing, and I'm really worried about her. I usually stay weekends at his place but chose to stay home last night just in case she came back. She didn't. He's now extremely upset the cat is a \"higher priority\" in my life than he is. I tried to listen to him, and explain that it's not a contest or a matter of priority between him and my cat, and that he's more than welcome to come hang out with me while I wait for her to return. He refused. He's now upset we can't spend \"family time\" with his neighbors because I want to stay home until l'm certain she's safe.\nThis isn't the first time I feel like he hasn't been supportive or accepting of my emotions, and I V wondering if I should be more concerned about this behavior?","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1678665965.0},{"title":"I (24f) have this irrational fear that someone with my boyfriend\u2019s (26M) baby is going to pop up randomly","author":"MasterpieceEither274","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11pucig\/i_24f_have_this_irrational_fear_that_someone_with\/","text":"I have been with my boyfriend for about 6 months now and we have been going pretty strong.

I like him and he's nice, and funny, and has seemed genuine. I would be lying if I said I thought there were no red flags at all, but there always are some I thought. We have some differences when it comes to certain lifestyle things and views, for example, feminism. Argued a lot about that. Thought I should stop talking to him when he said he likes a lot of what Andrew Tate has said, but then we talked and he said he doesn't know all the misogynistic things he's said and doesn't agree with that. Okay, so moved past that and kept talking.\n\nRecently I told some of my close friends about him and one of them told me that she has talked to him years ago. She says he would slide up on all her stories being very flirty, and when she started engaging more with him they talked for a few days back and forth, only he moved really fast and started calling her baby, saying he loved her, etc. so she made an excuse and they stopped talking.\n\nThen there is her ex boyfriend (who she still likes and has been kinda off and on with), who also knows him as they used to be good friends. The same day she told me, over the phone in front of me, she asked him about him and he said he's a hoe, tries to get with every pretty girl in the area, dm's so many girls, etc.\n\nLastly, there is a guy my friend is friends with asked who lives in the same area as him, who simply replied saying that \"he's heard he's a fuckboy.\" So i've heard this from 3 different people now.\n\nI don't know what to think. I don't just take what people tell me at face value so I asked him about some of these things, such as if he's dm'd girls in the past, or if he knows my friend. He said he spoke to my friend years ago, and thats it. I asked if it was just speaking, not flirty talking, he said not it wasn't like that. He said something like she's with a person he cares about and respects a lot (the guy he used to be friends with). With dm'ing he kinda went back and forth with what he said. First he said yes, he used to dm more girls in the past, but that was years ago. That he got more selective later but still dm'd here and there. Then when we talked about it again later he said he didn't dm in the way that I'm thinking. I asked if in the past he was direct and flirty the same way he was when he dm'd me (calling me beautiful and whatnot) and he said no he never did that with others. I was like how am I supposed to believe that when you did it with me? He insisted that he's serious about me the way he has been this whole time, that if we were together he wouldn't do anything to hurt me, that his past doesn't matter anyway, etc.\n\nI don't know if I did a good job explaining this and showing a grander picture. I feel torn bc I don't know who to believe. I also found it strange that his friend had some stuff to say about him, but he only had good things to say about him. But I suppose that could be so he doesn't look bad?\n\nSomeones past doesn't matter to me when they have good intentions and care about people that they're with, but the reason why I wouldn't wanna be with someone that has been wanting to get with every girl (even if it was before me) is because I don't believe that changes. I also believe the people that throw around words like baby and I love you with people they hardly know usually do it bc they want something, and they think that works, and they dont really value those words.

So, I (22F) was in a 4 year relationship, from which I was already feeling unhappy with some things like different visions of the future, self-indulgence, etc. Also, my boyfriend (29M) was very verbally aggressive in fights, which made me even more unhappy. In Feb 2022 we had a fight over me hanging out with some girlfriends and posting a photo of which he implied I was in slut clothes. I was very offended, he never apologized and a week went by without the slightest contact before I decided to break up. However, a 4 year relationship is not easy to get over and obviously I still loved him even though it ended. A few weeks later he contacted me, in that sweet, regretful way, which eventually made me relent and eventually we got back to talking. However, while I was separated, I had two boys, one of them being more than a kiss. Although we talked, I still saw him as an ex, I didn't know if we would get back together or if I WANTED to, even though I loved him, so I didn't feel the need to tell him or explain what I was doing with my life. There were two moments when I felt desired and more valued than when my own boyfriend called me a slut, and I decided to have different experiences and try to move on. After that, he and I had several relapses throughout 2022, in one of which he found out about the two boys looking at my cell phone.\nI'm not here saying that he has no right to be upset because I understand that it shouldn't be easy to digest as it wouldn't be for me if the situation were the opposite.\nBut since then, he's been treating me like I've betrayed him. He said if we were talking it was betrayal yes. While we had these relapses and tried to come back, in any discussion he would brought up this event and started calling me names again. I finally managed to cut ties with him only now, a year later, but the things he said really stuck with me and I feel like I can't move on from it. I heard that I'm a traitor, whore, that it's not hard for men to take me to bed, among others. But I stayed with these guys because I wanted to get him out of my head, I didn't feel like I owed consideration to a person who disrespected me like he did while still dating me. I was and remain single. He kissed a girl too, even though he said he loved me. However, in his view, it's not the same thing because I had sex and he only kissed her. I think it's very hypocritical of him because it doesn't matter if it was a kiss or sex, he also talked to me and kissed another in a moment of anger at me, the same thing I did. He called me a bitch while being his girlfriend, but in his view I was wrong for having been with other guys during my angry moment with him AND SINGLE. I apologized and blamed myself for the entire year as I started to believe it was my character flaw. I wanted to get back with the relationship, 1 went back to being with him and only with him for the whole year of 2022 after these boys. But we kept fighting a lot because he pressured me to admit to my parents that we were having contact and I didn't want to, since it hadn't been an official return and my parents never liked him. I was saving the hassle, I felt it was unnecessary to have this conversation with my parents if it wasn't official yet. This month we had another big fight in which he started calling me names again, basically slut shaming me. That's when I realized that he would never change, that he would always resent me. I cut all contact with him, but this ghost still haunts me. I still wonder if I was wrong and he was right. I am seeking advice in if I should forgive him and try to work things out.

Mind you he had been doing this while in a relationship with me. I confronted him and he told me everything. We broke up for a couple of days and I attempted to hook up with someone. I felt so bad for doing that so I forgave him easily since I felt I did worse. After a couple of days we were talking again and doing well. I know my actions were not cool so I decided I would never do that again because it doesn't help with anything.  I thought I could forgive and trust him again so we gave it another try. Today as we are laying in bed and he is showing me a video; a notification pops up. The notification was from Snapchat but I didn't mention it right away. I shut down and after a few moments I told him that I was triggered by this. He said it wasn't Snapchat it was from a game. I know what I saw but now I'm doubting it. I could feel all the anger and sadness within me when that notification popped up. \nBackstory: Before living with me he used to tell me he didn't have money because bills or this and that-to only find out he spent hundreds on others. Now he lives with me and he can't hold down a job and he has no initiative career wise.

During all this time, we never had sex. At the beginning, she said that it was difficult for her because it would be her first time and she had low self-esteem. She thought she was ugly because she had small breasts, but she was gorgeous, and it wasn\u2019t a problem for me. I started working on her insecurity, and after some time, she realized that she was beautiful. Not only that, but she was one of the most intelligent people that I\u2019ve met. And being a medical student with multiple intellectual hobbies (foreign languages, chess, programming), I knew a lot of intelligent people. Since she had a very bad self-image, I wanted her to realize how gifted she was.\n\nAfter two years of the relationship, she could accept my compliments. Even better, every time I said to her that she was beautiful, she used to say that it was a lie, that she was, in fact, gorgeous. This improvement made me very happy. Then, instead of seeing any improvement with our sexual life, she said to me she was asexual. She couldn\u2019t feel sexual attraction to anyone. But she said she was inclined to have sex with me when the right time came. I loved her (and I still do), and as a demisexual, I didn\u2019t see myself with anyone else. I\u2019d wait for when she was ready. However, because of the lack of sex in our relationship, she feared that I would end up cheating on her with someone who would have sex with me. It increased her insecurity over time, even though it wasn\u2019t a real possibility.\n\nAs time went on, I started to notice other red flags in our relationship. She was extremely jealous and possessive, to the point where she would get angry if I spoke to other women, even if they were just friends. She was jealous of my gay friends, even though I\u2019m not attracted to men! Even though I had always been supportive of her, she had an image of me that made me feel bad about myself. I tried to ignore these issues because I loved her so much, and she wasn\u2019t like that all the time. It got worse when she was tired, but since she worked and studied, only in the vacations she wasn\u2019t tired. I thought she was developing depression because she hated her work, and she was losing the will to do anything. Eventually, she started to distance herself, but I always did everything to save the relationship, and we eventually ended up close again. She said she saw herself as a burden for me and wanted to spare me from this problem. But I loved her, and I wanted to support her. But things got worse between us. She excluded me from Instagram because I liked a photo from a friend on a beach. Then a pinch of self-love hit me, and I realized that I was making a lot of sacrifices for someone who wasn\u2019t willing to make the same sacrifices for me. And it wasn\u2019t really a sacrifice: I just thought that initiating therapy would be something good for her, as it was for me. But although she promised me many times that she would begin therapy, she never did. Time made so clear how asymmetrical our relationship was: she stayed friends with a man who sent her a nude, but she wanted me to stop talking with a gay friend who joked I was his crush.\n\nShe decided to break up with me because she thought I was exaggerating her jealousy problem, and the several quarrels about it just made the relationship irreparable. We decided to remain friends, and I held the hope we would eventually reconcile. But only two weeks after she broke up with me, I saw her entering a restaurant with a friend from work. She didn\u2019t talk to me, and she seemed so happy with him. I was devastated to the point that I had a depersonalization crisis.\n\nSince we were still friends, I sent her a message later that day asking for an explanation. She said he was only a friend and that I was exaggerating. The following day, she stopped answering my messages. I felt so guilty for thinking that of her, and I waited for three months for her message, but it didn\u2019t come. Yesterday, I just ran into her at a concert. She was with that same guy and I was clear they had something.\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe that she lied to me. I couldn\u2019t believe that she was trying to find reasons to blame me to break up so she wouldn\u2019t feel guilty. I couldn\u2019t believe she was using me until she could find a replacement. I couldn't believe she would end up doing exactly what she accused me all along that I would end up doing.\n\nI can\u2019t believe I still love her even after that. I can\u2019t believe life sucks so much. I just can\u2019t believe she is such a terrible person.\n\nAny thought on that would help me.\n\nTD;LR: I was in a six-year sexless relationship with my supposedly asexual ex-girlfriend, who had low self-esteem and initially struggled with sexual intimacy. Over time, I noticed red flags such as her extreme jealousy and possessiveness. Despite these issues, I loved her and tried to save the relationship. However, she eventually broke up with me and I two weeks later I discovered she had seeing someone else. I struggle to accept that someone I loved so much could be such a terrible person.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678641291.0},{"title":"Not sure if my (23f) relationship with my boyfriend (23m) is healthy","author":"ThrowRA_1414","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11pt2nr\/not_sure_if_my_23f_relationship_with_my_boyfriend\/","text":"TLDR: boyfriend (23m) brought up concerns last night (Numbered below) now I\u2019m (23f) just confused on if our relationship is healthy\/if this is normal. We\u2019ve dated a little over half year.\n\nWe have been dating less than a year, have tons of mutual friends and everything seemed to be going great \u2026until recently. I am in grad school I\u2019m constantly studying and when I\u2019m not studying I try to make plans with friends or my boyfriend (he knows grad school is time consuming). My boyfriend works two jobs and didn\u2019t finish college. So he works a lot to be financially secure. Which means when I\u2019m free he\u2019s typically at work or vice versa. We hang out a lot just catching up, watching a few shows and then ultimately just going to bed because we are tired from our schedules. \n\nProblem starts: \nThe last few weekends I made plans with my friends for Saturday. I\u2019ve made these plans weeks before. Every time I see him after these plans I feel like he\u2019s upset with me. He makes comments like how he feels like he\u2019s not invited after we have a girls only dinner and then invite him to the bars but it\u2019s already so late (wasn\u2019t invited previously because we didn\u2019t know we\u2019d go out other bfs are there\/show up ). Also, he is invited to things but has work so he can\u2019t go. Like my friends and I went to an event he was invited but couldn\u2019t go because work which bummer but I\u2019m not upset because i understand work. After event we go to dinner and invite him, he has tight budget and said no he will meet us later which he did. I thought everything was going well. Then we get back to his and he lays out a ton of issues and was very emotional and drunk:\n\n1. He says it\u2019s not my fault but he feels inadequate he can\u2019t provide for me. Which I find kind or insulting as I take pride in being financially dependent from a man. I also don\u2019t understand what he means by provide. We are young and dating not married. And I said he provides enough emotional support, providing just isn\u2019t money but he seems to not get that. And it worries me it\u2019s a point of contention because after grad school I will likely be the breadwinner, which I have zero problem with as long as my s\/o isn\u2019t bumming off me\/making me feel used (I don\u2019t see how the difference from a man financially providing for a woman in marriage, to a woman financially providing for a man. Unless there\u2019s some unspoken thing I don\u2019t know about that men expect? Like i know they expect free childcare sometimes but that\u2019s not the point and not what I\u2019m getting at) \n\n2. That he feels like \u201cwe don\u2019t have quality time together\u201d. He has \u201cput ZERO effort in planning actual activities\u201d, I said that to him and he said he doesn\u2019t have money. Which upsets me as I feel like that\u2019s an excuse: I\u2019m more than happy to go on a walk or visit a free museum or have a picnic or even a planned movie night. He then says due to his past he can\u2019t plan because he\u2019s been gaslight about plans before. Which frustrates me an stresses me into making all the plans. So he wants planned quality time but can\u2019t plan it. \n-we do, do dates and stuff but I usually plan it. \n-I ask him to go on walks or walk around town and it\u2019s usually he\u2019s too tired or blows it off. \n\n3. He\u2019s making me guilty for hanging out with friends. I\u2019m starting to feel like he wants me to wait around till he\u2019s off work to see if he wants to do something because he can\u2019t plan. I\u2019m a very social person with little time, I value my friendships if i Can plan to see my friends I will the once a week I see them. He mentioned he is jealous my friends can spend time with me more which i see them once a week for activity we plan in advance . Also said I chose them over him\n\n4. I got us tickets to a concert because I wanted to go and I know he loves an artist. I was excited and thought this would be a great memory for us. But 5 times he\u2019s brought up these tickets and that he feels bad I got them for us because they were expensive and he can\u2019t do the same. I got them because I thought it\u2019s was an activity we both could enjoy but now I\u2019m dreading the concert and I kind of don\u2019t wanna go because I feel like I shouldn\u2019t of got the tickets, I was just excited. I\u2019m debating if I should sell them if they\u2019re such a sore subject. Or letting him take a friend instead of me ( even tho i want to go i just feel guilty). I would feel bad selling them because he was excited about them I\u2019m just confused.  \n\n5. Valentine\u2019s Day I got excited and prepped him a cute basket. He made bfast at mine (like usual) with what I had and brought me flowers. He said he got me something and it wasn\u2019t in yet, which okay i understand. Then he says i can pick out nice sunglasses which i wasn\u2019t too keen about as they were expensive. He hasn\u2019t brought it up so i haven\u2019t as I do not want to force him to get me nice gift. He mentions last night how he\u2019s sad he can\u2019t get me nice gift . Which I I don\u2019t need honestly i preferred a nice heart felt card but didn\u2019t even get that. Like literally anything sentimental I would\u2019ve been happy with. He says it\u2019s money but then he can spend money drinking at bar which he doesn\u2019t do a lot but I\u2019m like the price of one beer is enough for a card. (Haven\u2019t mentioned to him this bothered me)\n\n\nI sort of mentioned the above to him (besides vday) when he brought this up yesterday and all he says is I\u2019m not doing anything wrong it\u2019s just how he feels. Which leaves me confused. Like I\u2019m glad he can share his feelings and be emotional but i feel like he\u2019s blaming me and. I just feel guilty. I don\u2019t know what to think. \n\nAny advice?","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678662758.0},{"title":"I [25f] want to kiss my friend [25m], is there any good way of approaching this or should I let it go?","author":"cheezypinata","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11pt17t\/i_25f_want_to_kiss_my_friend_25m_is_there_any\/","text":"(we're from a conservative country so random kissing and hook-ups are frowned upon) \n \nTL DR: should I approach a guy who said he had a small crush on me, but has gone out with multiple girls, and is there any way to do this while not sacrificing my self respect?\n\nI got done with college a few months ago but my friend is still there pursuing his course.

Well this guy sends her a message wondering if she could watch his dog Monday-Friday times of which I would have already left for work and wouldn\u2019t be home by pick up not really a big deal like I said never given me a reason not to trust her. So she starts to get more info from the guy like dogs name attitude and trying to set up a meet and greet to meet the dog and see if he will work. All good things. Well the guy takes it upon himself to send my wife selfies of him and his dog. That is my first red flag I thought it was weird like why not just send pictures of your dog why do you have to be in them. So we set up the meet and greet. The guy shows up to our house I open the door and meet him and immediately think crap this guy is a good looking dude and if this goes well will be around my wife 5 days a week when I\u2019m not home. But whatever I trust her no reason not too. So we do the meet and greet and I notice my wife\u2019s body language and the way she talks shift from how she normally is around me or just other random people so I think hmm this is weird but whatever. So the meet and greet ends and Go pick up the kids from school. I go get them from class while my wife stays in the car then we head home and do typical family stuff. my wife goes to sleep a little later and I stay up and do some things around the house. About an hour after she goes to sleep for whatever reason I get this horrible gut wrenching feeling that something isn\u2019t right with this whole dog situation ( now before I say this I know looking through a phone is never okay and I never had before but this feeling wouldn\u2019t go away and I had to look so don\u2019t comment and focus on me snooping I know it\u2019s wrong) so I have this feeling and feel like I need to check her phone which I\u2019ve never done before and on her Lock Screen notifications a message from her friend let\u2019s call her Mary. Mary had texted my wife and said \u201c hey so you kept saying he smelt so good what did he smell like\u201d and I read this and my mind goes crazy like wtf is she talking about so that is what triggers me open up my wife\u2019s phone to look through it. I look at her and Mary\u2019s texts and there nothing else besides Mary message and I\u2019m like that\u2019s weird why would she say that so I go look at Snapchat and look at my wife\u2019s and Mary\u2019s messages on there and I find during the time I was picking up the kids and my wife was in the car she had sent Mary 5 video messages then no reply from Mary and another message from my wife that says \u201c he\u2019s is just such eye candy like omg he looks so good someone can look good but not be attracted to them\u201d and then Mary responds \u201cyeah you can look but you love your husband and would never cheat\u201d and my wife says \u201cexactly\u201d then my wife says \u201c he just smelt so good like yum\u201d and then that\u2019s the end of the conversation until Mary texts my wife and said\u201dyou kept saying he smelt good what did he smell like\u201d so I read these messages and wake my wife up and read her the messages she had sent and her first response is \u201cso you\u2019ve lost all trust in me\u201d and I say \u201cyes\u201d then she proceeded to tell me\nOh this was all a trap to see if you\u2019d look through my phone and got super defensive. And I was like how is this a trap nothing in here says you guys were setting up a trap and she says that what the video messages were okay but there no reply from Mary  at All to the video messages We argue for about and hour then go to sleep. So the next morning we wake up still both upset and I see my wife messaging Mary on Snapchat and I ask to see the messages and she won\u2019t show me just says I need to trust her. Well that night after she falls asleep I don\u2019t trust her at all now and so I look through her messages and she deleted every message she sent Mary but couldn\u2019t delete Mary\u2019s messages and Mary had said things like why would he contact me he probably hates me and thinks I\u2019m a bad influence and \u201cwhat trap\u201d which indicates to me the video messages were my wife explains how hot this guy was. so I confront my wife about that and she says I deleted them because you need to trust me. And then starts calling me toxic and threatens calling a divorce lawyer because I\u2019m being so toxic about this situation and won\u2019t let it go and I just need to trust her and calm down. Typical defense tactics because she fucked up wand wanted to regain control to which of course since I love her I bow down I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m being toxic I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ll let this go and not talk about just to keep the peace ( side not she never tried to communicate with this person after any of this never tried to peruse him or anything all that happened was the messages to her friend) then a few days she tells me she is not going to watch that dog but ask her friend to watch him and I tell her no this dog and guy need to be completely out of our lives they can find someone else but no one in our circle will watch the dog because then it leaves room for conversation and it to be brought up and she respects that. But then Later that night I find messages deleted to her friend that was going to watch the dog explaining that I didn\u2019t want them too because I was upset she called this guy attractive and such which is understandable explaining the situation but it\u2019s like why delete the messages? So we have a big conversation about how what she did was wrong and hurt me and she will never do it again and we will never delete anything and always be honest. But my trust now it\u2019s completely destroyed in her. I feel emotionally cheated on and so much deceit Because she never admitted it wasnt a trap and is sticking to this lie and said things to me like \u201cwas I telling my friend how hot he was for me no! Is he attractive yes. Am I attracted to him no\u201d which now it\u2019s like okay so you did explain he was hot. There just so many holes and trickle truths and gaslighting about this situation. but Everytime she starts to text someone or snap chat someone I wonder what it could\nBe about especially Snapchat because they auto delete so no matter what it\u2019s going to go away. Also my wife never ever talks to me or about me that way never calls me hot or attractive and says looks aren\u2019t important to me but yet gawks over this guy but I want to hear my wife talk about me that way. Now every time she gives me a compliment I don\u2019t believe because I feel like she is trying to make up for what she did or just make me feel better. It\u2019s hard for me to trust anything she says now because of all the deceit, deleted messages, and straight up lying to me and not coming clean which I have given her multiple opportunities to do so. Now we\u2019re 5 months later I\u2019m still having trust issues when she messages friends especially Mary and I just feel emotionally cheated on and all the deceit from deleted messages and the lie about the trap that she won\u2019t admit was a lie and I just don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nTLDR: I feel emotionally cheated on from my wife messaging her friend about another guy and my trust is broken and so much deceit because of deleted messages idk what to do","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678648164.0},{"title":"[UPDATE] My (24f) bf (27m) doesn't support my decission about my face and I don't know what to do anymore","author":"ThrowRA_15698","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11oszue\/update_my_24f_bf_27m_doesnt_support_my_decission\/","text":"This is the original post: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11kj4cw\/my_24f_bf_27m_doesnt_support_me_in_my_decission\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button\n\nSo, over the last few days I have been thinking a lot about this and I have had a serious talk with my boyfriend.

I\u2019ve got a little close with someone at work Basically ever since she starte. like to talk for a while while it\u2019s quiet etc. over the past few weeks I\u2019ve kinda noticed her starting to ask some personal question. One Most notably was if I was dating someone or perusing anyone. I replied I\u2019m not and shot the question back at her and she replied the same. we haven\u2019t really talked about stuff like that before but did get me thinking about stuff.   \n\n\nfast forward to this past weekend and we were at a party for someone leaving work. We both got there about the same time and sat beside each other at the table. It was kinda awkward at first as I was the only guy there at the time Haha. It got a little easier then when we started talking and out of nowhere we were talking about when she first joined the job and said that I was one of 3 people she gravitated to and talked to when she started. I was kinda thrown off by this as I\u2019m a notoriously hard person to go up and talk to when begging as I do have a very hard external look (resting bitch face etc. and wearing metal band shirts and a battle vest when not in work uniform and a general attitude towards new people due to the very short turnover in ew staff only lasting maybe 2 months at most so I don\u2019t normally get too attached to anyone just in case they arE let go) about me that I would say isn\u2019t exactly inviting to someone new. Anyway she said that and honestly I told her I couldn\u2019t believe her for those reasons. she smiled and said that it didn\u2019t bother her and said that I was one of the few nice and sweet people towards her when she started. After a while I told her i owed her a drink from this past gone Christmas party. So hot her what she liked and began talking again.   \n\n\nwe were joking about this app be real that she got a notification for. i told her I didn\u2019t know when it was and that I usually only have 3 or 4 social media apps at a time. Mainly Facebook and instagram and maybe snapchat. after I said snap chat and opened it up she asked to add her on it. Soo I did and warned her that I don\u2019t use it much and to just msg me if she wanted on instagram like we have before. Towards the middle of the night she was headed off with her work friends to a different bar that is too far out of the way for me but before she left she had one of the bar tenders to get me a drink and said it was repayment for the one I got her earlier even though I explicitly said she didn\u2019t need to repay me or anything.   \n\n\nfast forward to this evening I\u2019m in work and check my phone and see a notification in snapchat I open it and she that she has sent me a message in the early hours of the morning. The message read \u201dHi jamie get home safe \u2764\ufe0fu\ud83e\udd2d\u201d.  I sent one back just then and said \u201donly seeing this now Amy I did wbu?\u201d. She then replied \u201cgrand thx, wait what Jamie is this\ud83d\ude05\u201d I then replied \u201doh it\u2019s Jamie from work\u201d she said \u201cohhhhhh Hi Jamie \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude05 i didn\u2019t expect you to reply\u201d.

My wife is 21F and I am 24M We got married young. She grew up in a relatively dysfunctional household. Mom would hit her and withhold food from her and her siblings. That is just some background. We used to have intimacy 2-3 times a week. In the year and a half we moved to Arizona. Our intimacy dropped down to once maybe every 2 weeks. I ask for it and it gets shut down. She says she is not in the mood and doesn\u2019t feel like it. I understand, libidos will be different. But I feel rejected and I just feel sad. The problem is whenever I tell her how I feel she gets angry. Also, For the last year and a half she said she will see a doctor about it but never has.Which frustrates me because she thinks I am shaming her which I am not. I just quiet and I communicated to her that I need to work through it myself. When she gets angry she brings up things from the past. Like vacations we never went on. Or how we just had sex 2 weeks ago. It\u2019s gotten today the point, where I do not want to initiate sex anymore because I am tired of the rejection.\n\nMy problem is today she started screaming and throwing things. I am seeing a counselor because I just don\u2019t know what to do anymore. She said she will see one for her past traumas but still hasn\u2019t. I know I am not perfect by any means. I always make sure she is fed, safe and taken care of. I don\u2019t what else to do. She doesn\u2019t want me to seek advice from my family no more because they don\u2019t need to know what goes on. But I just don\u2019t know what to do. I am tired of being rejected and accused of cheating when all I do is go to work, school and chill at the house. I know she is not cheating either, so I don\u2019t have to worry about that. Should I stay or leave?

We were in a LDR, pretty much in love, about to get engaged. Everything was going great until we came to a point when he made me choose between him and my family which he later denied, saying he didn\u2019t mean any of that but this is another story. \nEven with that much time passed I am having trouble overcoming the break up because I thought he was the one I will spend my life with. \nSo looking back I recognise some stuff that might have been red flags which I ignored and I would like to hear your opinion.\n\n1. Whenever we were having problems: \n\n- he was going cold and silent, saying he processed things better this way. But sometimes it was so prolonged in time it was making me feel really anxious and questioning myself when all I wanted to do was communicate and sort things out.\n\n  - and I was asking him what I did wrong he was telling me to think about it. And when I really could not remember and was asking him to just tell me for the sake of communication and me doing better he just refused. Sometimes it just felt like torture.\n\n2. He was not okay with me going to the gym or wearing too revealing clothes even though I am not even that type of a person. He didn\u2019t forbid me but he said he was not okay because he didn\u2019t believe the guys out there.\n\n4. He wanted me to message him and send him pics whenever I go out and when I get home. I was finding this cute and caring and something to keep us more bonded and share our daily lives since we were in a LDR and he was doing the same but he was getting pretty upset whenever I was sometimes not able to do that or was just simply forgetting. I was pretty committed to fulfilling his request  and I think I was doing pretty well because I am actually not used to that kind of stuff and me doing that was a huge thing for me.\n\n5. When he was away he insisted on me meeting his aunts, uncles and cousins who happened to be in town all by myself when I made him aware of the fact that I was very uncomfortable of doing so. I am an introvert and that kind of stuff make me really anxious.

I am 26 F and my boyfriend is 31 M. I really thought that this was going to be a nice story but I dont feel very comfortable anymore. \nTo get a context, I have a history with abusive parents, partners and mental illnesses (depression mostly). Sometimes I have a hard time taking care of myself and it comes in waves. I have been to therapy, I have taken antidepressants, but now I feel it's coming again.\nWhen I started dating this guy, I have informed him about this and about my abusive past and he seemed like he doesn't mind and he would be there for me. Anyways, during my \"good phase\" I have noticed that he drinks often with his friends, and I don't mind him going out, but he would do that few times a week and then come drunk to my place and I told him that I don't like that and that I don't like that he gets so drunk every time someone calls him, regardless if he had something else planned. \nHe told me that I am too harsh and that he doesn't hurt anyone when he drinks, he's a happy drinker and he gets his job done etc. That is true. \nAlso, he has an illness, something with his bones, that potentially could get worse if he continues to drink and eat poorly and if he doesn't get enough exercise. I was really shocked that his so called friends would even let him drunk if they know that, but he is really defensive of his friends.\nNow, I have noticed my state getting worse again and I informed him, but he seems disinterested (might be just my brains assumptions). I cried the whole day due to my state, but I was texting him normally and tried to get over it myself (went for a walk with my dogs, seen my friends...). But at 7pm he stopped responding and I knew he was drinking again. I was crying since I realized that, because our last fight happened just a week before over the same thing.\nHe was supposed to get ready for a business trip and to buy some stuff he's missing and when he called me around 10pm he tried to lie to me to say he was sleeping or that he was getting stuff done and how I told him to call me (I didnt) and it was very frustrating for me hearing all those bad lies in my already bad state. I told him that he should go to sleep and he told me that I should go to sleep and hung up (he gets angry at me when he's drunk and I get mad). He's asleep now (we don't live together) since he falls asleep easily when he's drunk (even at the bar). And I am very very furious and I'm thinking even about ending things. \nI don't want to get myself in these agonies where I cry and wonder while my partner drinks and is having fun. I've had enough of abuse and I can't survive anymore. The problem is that I get attached to the person I'm with and expect them to be there for me when I go through my phases. I would also be there for him, but he doesn't see the problem with his drinking, except for me getting mad.\nHe seemed so nice, and usually is nice, but he drinks so often and seems like I'm a burden to him at those times...","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678660608.0},{"title":"I (19m) want to approach a girl (18f) but I'm very shy and I don't know what to do or say.","author":"VoyVolao","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11ps5w1\/i_19m_want_to_approach_a_girl_18f_but_im_very_shy\/","text":"First of all, I apologise if this isn't the correct subreddit to post this.\n\nI would like to approach a girl from my high school but I have no idea how to go about it.\n\nTo put some context, I don't know her at all.

Anyways, I knew about this early on in our relationship and didn\u2019t care much that she continue to be friendly with him. Both of them were pretty traumatized by her parents and their actions. I had a lot of sympathy. Probably a year or so ago we touched base on it again and I asked her not to text him anymore. Especially her initiating conversation. She had been venting about our relationship and he was gently trying to undermine it. I think he is still in love with her. Anyways. Fast forward to recently. I snooped on her laptop and I guess they still text on occasion. Every few months they chat shortly. Doesn\u2019t seem like she vents much anymore since we\u2019ve been married. But he continues to say things like \u201cI hope one day you\u2019ll come to your senses.\u201d.

A couple of months back, she picked up a job in a very good company in a different city. Even though she stays there, I drive to her city once a month during the weekend when both of us are free, just to meet her and be with her because I am absolutely in love with her. \n\nRecently, there has been a guy in her office who probably has a crush on her but nothing is confirmed. There have been 3 incidents recently soon after the other. I am a person who tends to get a bit jealous and insecure not because I don't trust my girlfriend but because I don't trust other people. The first incident was when he bought her gifts because she helped him a bit and she says that the help was not at all big for a return gift, he played it off by saying \"I will require more help from you in the future\". He got her handmade thank you cards, a flower, and a coffee cup with her initials written on them. She happily accepted all those gifts and told me in great detail with me asking about it. I didn't mind that because she is a very helpful person. The second incident was, so ever since we were friends I have been forcing her to watch a certain type of series to which she always said she will watch some time later, and it's been almost 10 years since I forced her, but the same office guy who gave her all these gifts suggested the same series, and she ended up watching because he told so, and she told me about this in great detail as to how he told her and she was convinced and I caught her when I saw she was watching on Netflix, as she uses my Netflix account. The third incident was, so she has a fear of falling from a two wheeler, hence she never sat behind me whenever I came to visit her on my bike, but when the same guy offered to drop her home, as it was late after their job, she sat behind his bike who dropped her home. Again, she told me about this story in great detail, and she randomly told me about it. \n\nI don't know if I am overthinking or if I am being insecure and jealous, or if there is actually something going on. I really don't understand, and honestly I trust her a lot, that I know she wouldn't do anything stupid. I don't know if I should worry or not or at least save our relationship before it gets ugly.

Everything between us is perfect, the sex is amazing (her words), the dates, and every moment I spend with her I'm at peace. A week leading up to our anniversary we would stay up late alot and talk about stuff like her past, she would keep mentioning her ex, who cheated on her after a 10 month relationship. I found it a bit concerning how often she brought him up, and was concerned she wasn't over him since their breakup wasn't too long ago. I remembered when 3 months into our relationship she got a text from her ex in front of me, and she said she would respond to him later. Later she told me he wanted to get back and she just told him to fuck off. Out of curiosity, I opened her phone while she was in the bathroom (fucked up I know), and went through the messages expecting her telling him to fuck off since she always talked badly of him. However I found a long conversation between them from that night, starting with him telling her he fucked up etc to which she responded by saying she hates him for what he put her through. However after some back and forth she calms down and tells him she misses him and what they had was very special. This then escalates into some light flirting which is then ended by a goodbye from him but she goes on by saying she likes his profile picture, thats where the conversation ends. Digging further I found out they were still together after he cheated.\n\nI confronted her about this, I asked her first why she felt the need to flirt with her ex and if she had any feelings for him. Her explanation was that she simply wanted to mess with him, by giving him hope that he could get her back, as revenge for him cheating on her. I asked her why she didnt tell me at the time and she told me she didn't want me to think of her as a petty psycho, and then she just forgot to tell me.\n\nI honestly don't know what to do, I love her more than anything and I know she does too, or atleast I thought so.

My relationship with both of them has always been up and down but their constant judgement, lack of respect, PRESSURE PRESSURE PRESSURE to work full time and to follow societal expectations has pushed me past my breaking point. \n\nSo i have never liked my step-mum, even when i was 3 i would be a brat and just pray to be with my mum when they would take me away for the weekend. During those times she would always take control of me disciplinary wise because my dad didn\u2019t know what to do, which resulted in slaps and punches on my arms, pinches, quick flicks, whispering threats in my ear and criticising about my body and very harsh fat shaming comments because i was born with stomach abnormalities from being born premature which made me constantly look bloated throughout my childhood. Turns out she used to have an ED so i\u2019m guessing it\u2019s just projecting her feelings onto me but still affected me in my early teen years. \n\nShe would also look down on my mum for not having a 9-5 job when i was growing up even though my mum did everything to make sure i was looked after and as a single mum with minimum child support from my dad, she did the best she could to raise me, which is why we are so close to this day :)\n\nFast forward to now (even the years in-between of criticism and emotional distress from them both) they are both the same shallow materialistic people. My dad mainly cares about money, very stingy with it and took 80\/20 of the money from him and my mums divorce which left us with not much growing up while they live in a 3 story house, buying new cars, gadgets, outdoor equipment, hot tub ect. \nHe hasn\u2019t left me much in his will and most of it is\/will likely be going to his wife (understandable i suppose) \nHe doesn\u2019t support me in anyway financially except for paying for my phone contract. Even if i ask him for support he is quite reluctant on it. \nIn conclusion for him, i love my dad because he\u2019s my dad, but he has done minimal effort for me and i just cannot be around him because his wife is constantly tagging along when i plan to meet up with him because she hates being \u201cleft out\u201d despite never being so. Even if i ask to just be with him she will somehow become involved. And his short temper and not thinking about how his words will emotionally hurt me makes me resent him even more. However, I will give him extra points for being supportive about my relationship with my girlfriend. \n\nNow his wife, as you can tell she is the bane of my existence and i wish i never met her, though i can\u2019t control who my dad chooses as a partner. She will still be very judgemental with everything i do and has no boundaries when it comes to her opinions about my work ethics and lifestyle choices (it\u2019s either work all the time and if you don\u2019t you\u2019re just a homeless lazy bum according to her logic, even though i do work, same with my dad now i think about it) if we are alone together we won\u2019t talk since we have nothing in common and isn\u2019t interested unless it\u2019s about making money. She talks behind my back to my dad and he will agree with everything she says because he\u2019s scared of starting an argument with her instead of sticking up for his own daughter.\n\nI know i am an adult now and have a right to make a decision but i feel like if i do it will be full of blackmail, endless arguments and guilt tripping. (i tried to end contact when i was 14 but this exact thing happened which makes me shit scared) \nWhat do i do? Any advice will help i just need to talk to someone who has been though a similar situation. Thank you so much for reading. \n\nSHORT STORY: i cannot stand having any contact with my dad and step-mum because of their opinions of how i live my life, how they drain me mentally after seeing them and don\u2019t support me emotionally or financially. scared of what they would do if i wanted to end my relationships with them.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678645725.0},{"title":"F30 M32 Question about Intercourse?","author":"Consistent_Comb_6447","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11pg43l\/f30_m32_question_about_intercourse\/","text":"Dear Reddits, I have a question about intercourse.\nMe (F30) and My bf (32) live together and have marriage plans, we are together for 1 year.\nWe both have full-time jobs, we live in Japan...so its normal to work 9 hours (1 hour break time).

We made a pact that our sisters' beef wouldn't affect our friendship, but we both went ahead and asked each of our sister's the full story. My sister M hated this girl J for hurting her guy friend (who J dated briefly on and off). Plus M always went on about how annoying and fake J is in general.\n\n\nIt turns out on J's side of the story, someone was ruining her relationships and spreading gossip. There were certain secrets J told, but only to 2 friends. One of them was my sister M, the other was a girl I also know but she always ignore drama. So J wondered if M was the one spreading all her secrets. Basically my sister M destroyed this girl's life. At the end of the school year, J tried to reconcile with M and asked her to be friends again and drop whatever unexplained tension they had between each other. My sister M scoffed in her face and said \"you think we were ever friends?\" and left.\n\n\nI asked my sister M if this was true and she said she doesn't remember much except laughing in her face at the end of the year. But does admit \"it does sound like something I would say, who cares. Shes fake anyways\"\n\n\n\nIt's not just this friendship. Throughout the years, my sister has lost so many friends because she's the type to \"I only prioritize ME\". I mean, thats okay, but I think it's her rudeness in telling people she prioritizes herself. This year, my sister limited one of her friends online from seeing her stories because this friend was full of drama and is toxic (makes sense). This friend found out and confronted M on if whether she did something wrong or hurtful that would cause M to partially block her. My sister asked for my advice on \"how to tell her I dont want to be friends with her anymore and she doesnt serve me\". Despite my advice on wording it nicely, my sister ended up telling the girl off and how she doesn't consider each other friends from the beginning.\n\n\nI find this very hurtful and sad that someone (despite being toxic) sees my sister as a friend and all M does was laugh on the side and wonder ways to tell her off or ask why shes so obsessed with her. The girl ended up blocking M after receiving her hurtful message. M lost more friends.\n\n\nLong story short, I'm starting to see my sister as an ugly person. I used to look up to her but I guess she's just rude. I still love her of course but i find myself disagreeing with her overtime.

We are both bi (as far as I am aware) and this is our first relationship. By this time we have been together for around three years and everything has been good: we share most of our interests, like the cozy familiarity of knowing each other throughout, and we have never fought since we tend to talk things through before we get to the point of getting heated. So basically on paper everything should be okay and close to being picture-perfect. \n\nI\u2019m also aware that my girlfriend sees me as her endgame and has made plans for our future (engagement, moving in together, having pets, and growing old and gray). It\u2019s just that somewhere along the lines I stopped feeling like that. I don\u2019t think I even know why I did and I think that is one of the reasons why I feel so torn up about this because on paper nothing is wrong and by all means, I should be happy. I just am not. \n\nI know the smartest move for me would be to end things so neither of us gets any more hurt or invested in my girlfriend\u2019s case. It\u2019s just that I am constantly going through this in my head, questioning whether or not this is what being in a long-term relationship should feel like. Or in my case, it doesn\u2019t really feel like anything, which in turn has left me feeling like something has to be wrong with me emotionally. \n\nThere is also some past baggage gluing me to my girlfriend and vice versa since she hasn\u2019t had the best of childhoods. I can now admit that I have been kind of unconsciously taking a \u201cparental\u201d role in our relationship by helping her raise herself, getting her out of her terrible home, and just teaching her about how the world works since she was very sheltered as well as being just treated like crap throughout her childhood. \n\nTo add to the already big heap of a struggle of trying to figure out my feelings about this situation, I recently have been spending more time in my home town (I study in another city) and have found myself spending a lot of time with my younger brother (18) and his friends (all of them also 18, mostly M). I have known most of my brother\u2019s friends throughout most of my life and we all have grown up together, but lately (a couple of months I think?), there has been a shift in the relationship between me and one of them (18M). I don\u2019t even know why, how, or when that switch happened and it has come completely out of the left field for me, leaving me even more confused. The switch is undeniable since other people have also noticed it (my brother, my family, and my brother\u2019s friends included) and even I cannot deny that I am drawn to him in a completely new way. \n\nAlso to avoid confusion, nothing romantic or anything of that sort has actually happened between him and me, but I still feel unbelievably guilty for this emotional shift. \n\nSo the issue at hand is that I clearly do not feel the same about my girlfriend anymore, I also seem to have caught feelings for somebody else (which in and of itself is more than clear to me, that I need to do something to do right by my girlfriend, myself and the person I am crushing on) and I am left confused about everything. Also to add a cherry on top of this mess, my girlfriend and I share a friend group, so I really need to think my moves through so all of this doesn\u2019t completely blow up in my face. \n\nHow do I even go about this without absolutely crushing my girlfriend who has literally done nothing wrong and this is all because of me? Am I even on the right path with my thoughts? I feel like a lost child and I need an outsider\u2019s perspective on this. Thank you all <3 \n\nTLDR: I (20F) have not felt sure about my relationship with my girlfriend (20F) despite nothing really being wrong.

I believe it's her longing for close connection and the feeling of a new friendship being like love. She has basically treated me as if I didn't exist for two months while she figured this all out and finally admitted this to me last night. \n\nSo, there's a lot of backstory to her finally admitting this to me and I understand her feelings are what they are. I believe she wants to be with me, not like she's decided now we're not compatible. We're in it together. The idea of being together for life made her want to figure herself out. \n\nHowever, my fiancee has been for the last two months really hanging out with a lot of her friends, she's like a teenage girl and constantly texting them, coming home late, gone all day and rarely updates me. She would dress up nice, do all these nice things for them. Her and I did get a good thing out of it because she admitted she was for a long time not happy with herself until she recently did her hair, got on medication and feels like an attractive woman again and she wanted to start having more, better and different sex. Her lack of confidence did affect our sex lives, thankfully that was something we know how to fix. \n\nBut, most of her friends are single, or in bad relationships, had bad relationships, talk of divorce, so I think she's really worried about our commitments to one another and influenced by that. Getting married made her want to discover if she's emotionally attracted to any gender, she said she finds anyone attractive if their personality is good but doesn't feel sexually attracted to women. I said it's probably just she didn't have any friends for a while to hang out with, I'm talking since we've been together for 8 years she only had one truly close friend for a while. So I said maybe you're feeling this new friend feeling and getting close to them is the same as \"love\". I am not trying to influence her because she's confused and she was afraid to admit it to me. I told her what hurt me is her not knowing how to communicate this with me and how I feel like I've been cheated on emotionally. I've been robbed of her presence and her shoulder to lean on for the last month. \n\nA couple weeks ago she didn't come home until 2 in the morning and didn't text me until maybe midnight and said she'd be home soon. She got home and I was like, WTF, I was worried and where have you been?! And she just dropped that she feels like we're family and not lovers. I said we're both, that's how a relationship works when you settle down. We were guilty of being in a routine with our jobs for a while but we both know we can figure that out. We have a house together and have relatively serious jobs so our time together I said sometimes has to be about the house, and those mundane tasks. She wasn't taking any part in it, like she resented it. I bought some plants for us to plant and things she mentioned in passing thinking was nice but she give it a moment of consideration and then was gone. \n \nI try not to hold her back because she seems so confident and happy with new friends but now I understand she was in a way ignoring me and in my mind, in a weird way cheating on me because she was somewhat using those friends to fill this void and see if her feelings grew. \n\nSo, last night she comes home late again, we hadn't seen each other all day as I worked and she went to run errands and hang out at 9 AM. She got home at 1 AM. I knew\/know she isn't cheating with someone else but last night I put it together that something isn't right and I still didn't know about her feelings of this emotional attraction to people. So I realized she at least was robbing me of my happiness and her presence. I gave up a lot for her when we met because we were so lively together and had such an immediate connection when we met. My friends saw that and were happy and gave space. \n\nShe was emotionally needy at that time, I had to devote myself to her and my time because we both recently moved to a new city, separately but met there. She had no support and I had a few friends. I knew it might be rough but she was in a vulnerable position and I accepted it. We instantly were in love and could understand one another. I remember her calling me because I was with friends and being sad because she would be left alone, she couldn't handle this abandoned feeling, yet, she did it to me so much lately. That's why I'm confused by her not opening up to me about this. \n\nNow, most of my friends moved away and most friends I have now have kids and I see them rarely, so I'm sometimes alone and had a long day at work and want to relax and have her there but she's running off to hang out with friends and mentally I could tell wasn't with me when we were together... It hurt me deeply to add it all up last night.\n\nLast night when she got home, and I said, I'm worried about you and where you are, reverse the roles and you'd be upset, please tell me what's up and she admitted to not understanding but that she felt this way for a while, felt confused about her attraction. I just listened to her at first but then said, we're a unit, we can survive anything together but if one shows weakness then the other can't be strong forever... I was the emotional stronghold forever and feel taken advantage of. We're getting married in a month so this feels extra emotional. \n\nWhen she comes home so late during work days I feel so disrespected too, I'm working overtime for us to build more savings, I wake up early, she knows I'm going to be worried or awoke by her coming in, she then usually tries to, I feel, cover it up by trying to have sex all the time, like she can't feel a connection otherwise. \n\nWhat should we do as a couple?  I want to support her as she's confused but it's been such a mental burden. Anyone have experience with being emotionally attracted to any gender but not really sexually attracted? I know that's territory where everyone is different but even she's confused so any insight would be appreciated. We are trying to not do routine things, yet, even today after this talk last night into the early morning, she still runs off with a friend, like she can't be without them, after all that. She had a \"time limit\" and she said I could enforce a curfew. I said I'm not your parents and not controlling you in that way, just please be more considerate of me. How do we have a curfew or clear guidelines that doesn't feel controlling? It's new for to have friends and balance the relationship with me. \n\nI had to do so much on my own and feel taken advantage of now. It hurts. Please help. I didn't know I could be so hurt by someone I love and care for so much.","upvote_ratio":0.66,"created_utc":1678657456.0},{"title":"I [23F] sometimes wish my bf [32M] expressed his affection verbally more often","author":"dreambeyondthedawn","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11pkzgh\/i_23f_sometimes_wish_my_bf_32m_expressed_his\/","text":"We\u2019ve been dating for a bit over a year and it\u2019s been really good, we\u2019ve been through different phases over the months but I think we have a healthy way of communicating and I know that he loves me. \n\nWe\u2019ve discussed love languages before and I shared that I am aware words of affirmation is a huge one for me. I know that saying \u201cI love you\u201d more or less often has no actual impact on how likely a relationship is to succeed, and I do feel blessed that I feel loved without the need for him to tell me, but hearing it from time to time, along with being told I\u2019m beautiful and\/or desired, goes a LONG way for me and makes me feel very loved. This is especially important to me when I\u2019m having a rough night for some reason and although I can pick myself up and I don\u2019t need my partner per se, I would like to feel like I can count on some words of love because they really put my mind at ease. \n\nMy bf has a much lower necessity for verbal expression. He will tell me that he loves me from time to time, and I know when he says it he really means it, but I wish he was more generous with it. Last night we were talking on the phone and I was feeling down (not insecure or doubtful of his love for me, I just really wished to hear from him that he wanted to see me or anything of the sorts) so I asked him to \u201csay something loving to me\u201d. I felt awkward asking for this but I didn\u2019t know how else to communicate the need I felt, and ending up frustrated and unsatisfied didn\u2019t seem like a good option either).\n\nHe said I cannot ask for something like that, because the more he feels forced to say things like that, the less he will feel compelled to tell me by his own account. I asked why, and said that, to my mind, you won\u2019t necessarily run out of love the more you say it, and that I was just trying my best to communicate a need I had in the relationship since I\u2019ve had unmet expectations in the past, and sure, I try to manage my own expectations since he isn\u2019t responsible for them, but I also wanted to be sincere. \n\nHe then told me that he does think love runs out or at least loses meaning the more you say it and that in all his previous relationships, his ex-gfs were a lot less verbal with it than he was. And that I have a really high need for verbal affection.\n\nWe see each other no more than once a week and don\u2019t even say I love you each time we do (maybe sometimes over the phone). He used to be a lot more verbal in the first 6 months, which is fine because everything was new but I kind of miss it sometimes. He told me he hasn\u2019t noticed a change in him in that regard. \n\nI don\u2019t need big, eloquent, intense speeches, just a compliment or a \u201creally wish I could kiss you right now\u201d from time to time. And all of my friends do seem to be a lot more verbal with their partners. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m needy or immature for feeling this need, but I don\u2019t know how to compromise on this. It worries me because it makes me doubt the relationship, since I don\u2019t have the need to stay with someone who cannot try to learn to speak my love language or be worried that they will exert the love they have for me if they do. \n\n\nTL\/DR; I wish my bf told me nice things more often since words of affirmation is my love language. I tried to communicate this need last night over the phone and my bf said saying things out of obligation makes them lose their meaning. I don\u2019t know how to compromise this need and feel satisfied without asking for it.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678643813.0},{"title":"we (27f 30m) broke up and got back together again, will it ever work?","author":"ThrowRA-peepoopoo","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11pqrme\/we_27f_30m_broke_up_and_got_back_together_again\/","text":"TL;DR - we broke up and got back together and im havign serious doubts about whether this was the right decision 5 days later.\n\nSo we have a daughter together and a house which is up for sale as a result of first breakup.

He came over the next day to discuss how and when we would both share our time with our daughter, he immediately came in angry and shouting and I told him if he raises his voice again he can leave. From this point on, it felt like we had our first adult, calm and productive conversation ever. We talked all day and talked all night. We discussed how we both felt as far as our relationship, I expressed how much he hurt me in every way and in detail. He seemed to really take it in for the first time in our 5 year relationship. We laughed about the good times and cried over the bad. He stayed the night on the sofa to help me with the school run for the first time and spent another day discussing what now?\n\nHe asked if I would give him another chance, if not for him but to try and keep the family together for our daughter and after realising we are capable of discussing things productively I agreed.\n\nIt's been less than a week, 5 days and now I can't sleep.

In the 4 years we've been together we've been through finishing uni, COVID lockdowns, starting our careers, buying a house and a cat together and now we are coming up to a year living together. I figured that we'd get engaged at the end of this year, but it's really not looking like it. My thought being that by  November-ish we'll have been together for 4.5 years, lived together for 1.5 years. It seemed kind of perfect but it doesnt seem like it will be the case.\n\nHe basically said that he doesn't see marriage being on his mind until he's like, 30. He still seems himself as very young, and marriage being something for when he feels like an *actual adult*. He said he looks at his parents, who got married and had their first child at 23 and can't fathom it because he still feels like he doesn't have his life together. I mean in some ways I agree, I do think COVID robbed us of a couple years so a lot of us do feel younger, I also think both of us while we are in very professional, upstanding jobs are actually both quite immature. I still feel like how I did when I was 18 and don't always feel 'mature enough' but I've always chalked that down to imposter syndrome. \n\nThe conversation made me feel a little...unsure. I guess it just makes me worry that he'll never feel ready, or I'm not actually the one for him and he's just passing time with me. Maybe it's silly to put an arbitrary time frame on it as I don't know why it matters to me so much, our relationship will still the same with or without marriage and it's not exactly going to be any different. I guess I've just always wanted it and to me it's the next step, to solidify our commitment to one another. \n\nLast thing I want to do is pressure him because it'll foster resentment from either side and I would never want him to just say 'oh go on then' and just give in to marriage, I want him to genuinely want it.

People are \nindividuals and things like relationships can be as unique as they can be typical IMO. So I try to reframe from generic relationship advice for that reason\u2026 but at this point I\u2019m so lost and confused, idk what to do.\n\nLong story short, I truly feel like my ex and I\u2019s relationship is unique. I have a 6yr old from a high school relationship, my ex is the most independent person I\u2019ve ever met (her whole family lives in different states, she\u2019s done everything on her own from paying her own way through college, buying cars, etc all on her own) \n\nMy family is the opposite, very close knit and my mom particularly is hard to deal with. Stereotypically, my child\u2019s mother is also extremely difficult to deal with. \n\nWe had little things come up in our relationship that was just between my ex and I, but I\u2019d say 80-90% of the stress and contention came from outside. My son is a type one diabetic, for example. And again, his mom and my own mom are extremely hard to deal with and it seemed every step we\u2019d take forward with my son, their actions would bring us 5 steps backwards. \n\nMy ex always did everything she possibly could for my son, and she\u2019s told me repeatedly thats one of the biggest issues is that she tried so hard for him but at the end of the day she doesn\u2019t have any legal authority over him or his health so she was constantly fighting an uphill battle. \n\nAdditionally, my ex is like a medical anomaly. Since she was little, she\u2019s had really crazy medical issues. She\u2019s had practically every procedure done, she has a 3 ring binder literally full of medical records and documents from over the years. Her and her mom are constantly discussing possibilities and researching.\n\nFor example, she throws up multiple times every single day and rarely eats because it just comes right back up. She\u2019s constantly nauseous and fatigued. \n\nDespite that, she didn\u2019t go a single day without making my son breakfast lunch and dinner, brushing teeth with him, helping him with homework etc. like literally everything you\u2019d expect a mother to do, she did. She\u2019d literally run and throw up then get right back to playing with him or doing whatever it was they were doing together. Obviously I didn\u2019t make her do any of it, I was a single father for 4 years before meeting her so I\u2019ve always been the one to do all that and more with my son. But her natural motherly instincts and tendencies was one of the reasons I fell in love with her. \n\nFor the past year we lived together, and things really got bad about 6-8 months into living together. She still always showed up for my sim and did everything she\u2019s always done but got noticeably distant from me. One thing we had in common is we\u2019re both very affectionate. \n\nUp until the point I\u2019m talking about, we always held hands, hugged, kissed, cuddled, regular sex etc. \n\nThen seemingly one day it all just stopped. \n\nWe had countless talks and I genuinely worked on all the things she told me to work on. But it was never enough, nothing I did changed how she treated me.\n\nTo save time, we ended up officially breaking up and I moved out and let her just keep the house while still helping her pay everything for the rest of the lease, which was ending in 1 month at the time I left. \n\nShe\u2019s told me things like she needs her own space and time to work on herself and that I do too, which I do agree with. I think we did move in together too soon perhaps. She\u2019s told me to wait for her and that if I don\u2019t she doesn\u2019t want me anyways, if I can\u2019t just wait for her. \n\nBut we\u2019ve remained close, I guess. The lease ends on the 30th of this month so I helped her move into her new apartment after some drama with the movers she hired. I\u2019ve helped her fix things and I\u2019m taking care of the house in terms of dinged walls and stains etc. \n\nThe day I helped her move she gave me the tightest hug she\u2019s given me in months and told me she does love me while crying. She even made a point to look me in my eyes and reassure me that there\u2019s no one else and she\u2019s truly just trying to figure out what she wants.\n\nBut for the past few weeks I have to initiate contact. Even when I do it\u2019s no telling if she\u2019s reply to me or not. She only texts or calls me if I text or call her. I\u2019ve went up to four days without talking to her and it was eating me alive so bad I reached out and we had three hour phone convo while I was at work (I work on the road). \n\nBut at this point I\u2019m starting to resent her I think. She only really talks to me if it\u2019s regarding my son because she clearly loves him. An important point I feel I should mention is that I do owe her money which I\u2019ve been paying her every week for the past few months on top of rent etc. the total was 7,000 and honestly I haven\u2019t even been keeping track of how much I\u2019ve sent or how much left I owe. \n\nIt\u2019s starting to feel like she\u2019s keeping me strung along just so that I pay her back, that she thinks if she told me the truth I wouldn\u2019t pay her anymore and that\u2019s where the resentment comes In. \n\nI feel this way because she expressed that concern when I moved out, she just up and decided I wasn\u2019t going to pay rent anymore or help her take care of the house even though we\u2019ve talked about it numerous times and I was very clear that I\u2019m going to do what I have to as a man regardless of where we stand.\n\nBut she keeps telling me that she just needs time and for me to wait for her. \n\nSo any opinions or advice would be appreciated. I\u2019m just at a loss at this point. \nIs she just keeping me on the line to make sure I pay her or is there something still here. \n\nLike I\u2019ve told her, I just need to know for my own piece of mind. I hate living in this purgatory that I have been but I\u2019m trying not to disrespect her or our relationship by moving on too quickly but I\u2019m afraid she either already has moved on or is simply just keeping me strung along to ensure she gets her money which I\u2019m going to keep paying regardless and I\u2019ve told her that a million times","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678656919.0},{"title":"My gf (19F) broke up with me (20M).

Julia knew what was exactly going on and she used him. she even made him tell \"julia, if i get a girl and she would be jealous of you, i'd leave her right in that moment\" she made a perfect place to his heart and his life. and she never wanted to be close to me like we used to be. in fact, she is trying to ignore me and exclude me from the conversations. \n\ni get a bad vibe from her. and this is the part that really hurts me. \n\nmy boyfriend is under her impression. even though he says that i am the love of his life. he acts like that person is Julia, not me. he compares us all the time and telling me she is better than me in almost every way. he once told me \"she is braver and funnier than you\" when we were on the vacation just because i didnt jump off a stupid bridge with him. he laughs with her more, he has fun with her more. he always finds her right no matter what. for example, when she does a bad thing that my bf would never approve and make them regret the second they tell him they did this thing, he wouldnt care and always says \"if Julia did this, she has her own reasons\" \n\nalso they are extremly touchy to each other. she always touching him somehow, always has a reason. like scratching his big-bodybuilder-muscular back or massaging it, or she plays with his hair. and he loves taking her into his arms to hug, wrestle or just jump on her in the middle of the sea as a joke. she always calls him 'babe, love, honey, sweetheart' etc. they hang out mostly in the late hours. my bf usually call her \"man, bro, buddy etc.\" but she never does\n\nshe once saw a wet dream about him and told it to my bf, i still dont understand what is the purpose of this??\n\ni talked to him about it. i told him that he has feelings for her and she is using him for it but he denied as expected. so i told him even though those are all normal things to them, i feel uncomfortable. then he said he will be more careful and he can even cut her off. but i know he didn't mean it, he would hate me the rest of his life. so i told him to be more careful. then he did for 2 days or smt. but he was always angry and treated me bad. he was never happy. just bc he was being CAREFUL. even didnt want him to cut her off \n\nso i talked to him again and told him it was my mistake, he can act like whatever he wants and all i did was overthinking. \n\nand you know what? it made him so happy in the moment, he eventually started to smile again. \n\nwe were good for a few weeks. then i exploded. i sweared and yelled and we had our worst fight. he told all of these to Julia, he trusted her since she is the best emotional supporter friend and he asked her help like \"what should i do to fix this?\" \n\nthen Julia went to his bf Carl, told her everything my bf said aaaand i am too toxic and even sick so i shouldn't be talking to any of them. Carl yelled at me \"you are talking about my best friend of years and my girlfriend, are you insane?\" \n\nhe felt inconfident when he saw things as i did and he understood what Julia was doing. \n\nMy bf protected me all along, he stood beside me. And disgusted by Julia, he is no longer trust her. But he doesnt wanna lose Carl. I too want their friendship last. \n\nSince Carl's not gonna break up with Julia, i dont know what should we do?\n\nTLDR; i was feeling uncomfortable about this girl and i told my bf about it, everything ruined when he told it to his girl bestfriend","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678656500.0},{"title":"Me (20 M) and my girlfriend (18 F) are in a romantic relationship but her parents disapprove","author":"breezeysnow","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11pqe37\/me_20_m_and_my_girlfriend_18_f_are_in_a_romantic\/","text":"Me and my girlfriend have been dating for a couple of months now, but her parents disapproved of me solely because of the two year age gap.

I specifically say as a partner because she\u2019s an incredibly successful medical professional with all the confidence in the world at work. She\u2019s also never been in a healthy long-term relationship and is definitely a loner. Her past and view of self presents as intense insecurities which is exacerbated by the fact I had an 18 year relationship that was mutually ended (we just grew into different people). She struggles that my ex and I are amicable and we co-parent a 6 year old together. Early on I asked her to consider therapy and she blew up at me so I dropped it. \n\nMy gf and I share a lot of similar relationship values, have a ton of passion, and I really have a lot of respect for the past she\u2019s overcome to be who she is today. 90% of the relationships is A+. Back in November we had a major blowup on vacation and I was at the end of my rope with how she was acting. I told her the only way I stay is if we do couples counseling. She finally agreed. \n\nCouples Counselling was an incredible experience for us and she was able to dig into a ton of her issues. She agreed that it was very helpful and thanked me for encouraging it. Things were always better after therapy even if it was hard. Unfortunately it was out of pocket and almost $400\/month. Since the session almost entirely focused on her past the counselor suggested she just get her own using insurance and we stop couples therapy. She agreed. Well that was almost 2 months ago. \n\nToday, my gf got upset as I said I had given my ex a tool that I now needed. I gave it to her to put together my kid\u2019s bed at her new place. She immediately got cold and I could tell what was going on. My exact comment was, \u201cI don\u2019t have my nice screw driver to fix the dryer as I gave it to my ex to put some furniture together when she moved out.\u201d She took that to mean I made a special trip to give her the tool when in reality I just did it at the custody handoff. And it was back in July \u201822. She said that the way she interpreted it is the only way it could be. This made me frustrated that she was all weird about it and I basically called her out on not seeking therapy as promised. I doubled down and told her she had 2 weeks to do it or I was done. \n\nShe didn\u2019t take kindly to the ultimatum and I somewhat walked it back, but the end remains, I need her in therapy to continue. She does so well and I think she just finds it hard to discuss her tough past. Is it fair to demand this? How do I stick to my guns and not back down?

For clarity and also for their privacy I'll give my partner the name Charlie. We've been together for around 3 1\/2 years, have a really happy and healthy relationship and also live together.\n\nSince we've been together we've had a few discussions where my partner has expressed some level of confusion when it comes to their gender. Now, for some context my partner really struggles to talk about their feelings so these comments are always brief and are not dwelled on in conversation, they're not often that serious in tone- we've never really had an in depth, serious conversation about this. \n\nAll I know from what they have told me is that they know they don't identify with being a woman as this is something they considered for a while, but didn't feel comfortable with. They also don't feel as if they align with being a man completely either, and to this day they aren't too sure. My partner has a pretty masculine appearance (tall, broad shoulders and chest, heavy facial hair, short hair etc etc) and dresses in a very masculine way most of the time and really seems to really like the way they dress. However their personality has always felt more androgynous to me. \n\nRecently I accidentally stumbled upon a post Charlie made that I wasn't supposed to see, I was looking for a post they made on a gaming subreddit; instead I found a post where they spoke about how really they think they might be non binary, and how much stress it has caused them recently.\n\nAround the time the post was made I could see that they were really struggling with something, but they never told me what, and would just brush it off. I respected that they didn't want to talk about it and didn't pressure them to tell me anything they didn't want to. The most they told me at the time was that they were incredibly stressed out and they wouldn't go further than that, but they did reiterate how stressed they were rather frequently. I did what I could to support them but it was clear they really didn't want to give me too many details.\n\nCharlie isn't the sort of person to talk about their feelings unless they're at absolute crisis point, and even then they find it hard, so the fact they made a public post asking for help and advice about something so personal worried me a lot. Discussing really personal feelings on social media is something very out of character. Clearly Charlie needed to talk about their problems, meaning they were at some sort of breaking point. \n\nI love my partner more than anything, and them being non-binary wouldn't change my feelings towards them in our relationship in the slightest. Charlie knows I'm bisexual and that I really don't mind what gender my partner is. \n\nIt's really upsetting knowing how much they are struggling, especially because Charlie doesn't know that I know.\nThey are extremely sensitive around their privacy, and knowing that I saw such a private post would make them feel extremely uncomfortable and upset.\n\nUltimately I know that Charlie will internalise all of this and will likely continue to let it stress the life out of them for an incredibly long time. I don't want to pressure Charlie into coming out or openly questioning their gender, but at the same time I want them to know that I'm supportive of them, will still love them, and am more than willing to help them try out new things to help them express their gender. Personally I'd be really excited for Charlie to start feeling more comfortable with themself and it would be absolutely lovely to experience that process with them.\n\nBut how on earth do I open up a conversation about this? Should I even start a conversation about this? How can I make my Charlie feel more comfortable in expressing and experimenting with their questions around their gender? How can I let them know that I would be there to support them?\n\nI wondered if anyone had any similar experiences, I am really lost on the right way to go about this and the last thing I'd want to do is make Charlie feel worse.\n\nSorry for the long post I'm terrible at being concise lol.\n\nTLDR: I accidentally found out my partner might be non-binary and I'd like some advice on how to move forward and support them.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678655516.0},{"title":"My (33f) husband (37m) keeps calling himself fat","author":"THCsometimes","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11pgvfg\/my_33f_husband_37m_keeps_calling_himself_fat\/","text":"Obligatory cell post, please pardon formatting errors. \n\n\nMy husband and I are both naturally thin and athletic people.

I have been at home without income since then, and it has added an extra pressure onto my husband. He never really ate during the day, he\u2019s more of a grazer of healthy snacks. Recently, we\u2019ve started using creamer instead of just milk alternative in our coffee, but otherwise our lifestyle is the same. \n\n\n\nThe other day, he had to put a suit on for the first time in a few months and his pants didn\u2019t fit. I\u2019ve also noticed a little belly on him, although I would never say anything (nor do I mind\u2026 love me a sexy dad bod). He has now started calling himself fat, sometimes joking sometimes serious. He claimed it\u2019s the creamer\u2019s fault, and wants to ban it from our house. He wants to ban all sweets from our home as well. We went for a walk yesterday and stopped to get a coffee and he ate a chocolate croissant. He mentioned several times that he needed to go on a run to work off that one croissant. He also suggested that he eat less. \n\n\n\nNow, I don\u2019t mind cutting out more sweets even with my sweet tooth. I don\u2019t mind that he wants to be healthy and work out. I do mind how he talks about his body and diet. I don\u2019t think creamer is to blame for his extra layer of love, but the loss of his fast metabolism (he\u2019s closing in on 40), and stress from being the sole provider, a new dad, and navigating how our relationship has changed. I\u2019ve already asked him to not speak so negatively about his body in front of our very young son, and to consider if he would want our son to talk about himself like that. I also reminded him he can\u2019t eat less because of how minimally he eats as it is. \n\n\nHow can I be supportive of my husband? I hate how he is talking about himself and his relationship to food. These are all new behaviors for him. \n\n\n\nSide note: I would never ban sweets from my child once he\u2019s old enough for it. I\u2019m a firm believer in dietary balance, and \u201cbanning\u201d something will only damage my kid\u2019s relationship with food.","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678634032.0},{"title":"My (37 F) co-worker (33 F) was not supported by our team (early 20s to mid 40s M & F) when she was promoted, how can I support her?","author":"ThrowRA-RiverAtlas","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11pk6bi\/my_37_f_coworker_33_f_was_not_supported_by_our\/","text":"My co-worker, Lucia (33 F), has recently been promoted at work.

I just got a new job and she was moving into a better position, we traveled a lot to gather and did a lot of adventurous activities and events starting off in our relationship! \n\nWe started really fighting towards the holiday times at the end of 2022. We had our spats before, most of the times it was fighting about chores and who does what, bc we just had moved into together. the struggles of moving in together took us a definitely a few months to figure it out. I thought we were at a pretty decent point in December. Then all sudden, we have started a fight and argue about where we shall spend time for Christmas and days before and after. We are really going at it because we are both trying to state the point that we should be celebrating the holidays with both families. Besides the actual argument, we both tend to go off the others emotion and feel what the other says, we both with speak in fear of emotions and then at the same time we speak only out of emotion. \n\nThe actual fight about Christmas time and family spending time was resolved and we have not brought that back up.\n\n\u2026 the problem now \nIs that we are have fought nearly every weekend since, the fights have escalated to same \u201celementary\u201d fight(s), arguments  and screaming matches.

It was obvious that he still liked me atleast a little bit because he didn\u2019t want me to text other guys or like mess around with other guys which i was fine with considering i still liked him.

Basically after our 4th no contact period he unblocked me (3 days ago) and we started back up with friends with benefits , but he told me he was looking to start something with another girl which broke me because i still lowkey have feelings for him, so we argued for days about this and he was really mean saying that he never cared about me etc. So i pretty much started messing around with the first guy to give me attention and he gave me a bunch of hickeys. then I went out with my ex today we were messing around and he saw the hickeys and was rlly disappointed and disgusted and started saying that this is the last time i\u2019ll ever see him again and how he\u2019s officially done with me. He even cried because he was so hurt. Then he again blocked me everywhere. Now i think he hates me for good. Will he ever reach out to talk or is our relationship completely ruined?","upvote_ratio":0.54,"created_utc":1678655168.0},{"title":"What\u2019s the best way I (24F) can get some space from my coworker\/friend\/crush (24M)?","author":"gatorlatorade","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11pptn4\/whats_the_best_way_i_24f_can_get_some_space_from\/","text":"I know, this is a tricky one.

It\u2019s worked out very well for me and while I am not cured I feel better than I have in years. Here\u2019s the problem my husband and children hate the food. My husband wants me to either stop the diet or cook three meals one for me, one for him and one for the kids. I already cook a separate meal for the kids because they are autistic and have food aversions. \n\nA little backstory my husband is an extremely picky eater, probably also on the spectrum. Before I went plant based he would eat what I cooked at most 2-3 days a week. He usually would end up getting fast food. Now that I am eating plant based he is never eating what I make. He is upset because he says he misses home cooked food. I offered to grill up some chicken, ground beef, etc. for him to add to what I already am making but he won\u2019t touch any of the plant based food. \n\nSide note. My husband doesn\u2019t cook, but he does the dishes. I stay home with my children because they cannot go to daycare or full day preschool because of their autism. (They won\u2019t accept them). My husband has a long day, gone 7-7 working in an office. I know he is tired when he gets home, but I\u2019m also exhausted myself in the evening trying to keep the kids entertained and safe. My health condition makes it really hard to get through the day sometimes. I have considered making my own food at lunch time, but it would mean more screen time for the kids and I feel like they already get too much. They use iPads while I make dinner so they are safe and occupied (please don\u2019t shame me for this I am in survival mode raising two very young autistic children and I do my best). \n\nAnyways I am looking for some advice.

Before I came here I never did night shifts at my work (medical). They are a big responsibility, so when I started, my boss said that I should wait a while before starting them. I attempted to start at the beginning of the second month, but boss said I wasn\u2019t ready yet so I only begun at the end of the second month.\n\nWell, all the night shifts are divided between the juniors. We are 8 in total. The day after a night shift is usually off, and weekend shifts are only during the day (no night) and double pay, so everybody avoided Fridays (since there is no day off afterwards and you spend your whole Saturday sleeping) and wanted to do weekends (for the double pay and no sleep lost).\n\nWhen we divided the night shifts for the first time (for first three months) I could only take a few night shifts since I was only beginning. When we divided them the second time(the last three moths of the exchange) my colleagues insisted in dividing them when I was away on my vacation - so they chose for me, I just gave some indication and said yes\/no to some options on the phone. I have less night shifts than my colleagues (but only if you don\u2019t take into account that I wasn\u2019t supposed to do them for the first two months anyway). However, I have the correct number of Fridays and only have the number of weekend days I was supposed to have. I said nothing since I didn\u2019t do any night shifts for the first two months so I figured it\u2019s fair. \n\n\nTHE PROBLEM: One of my coworkers - 27F (the only one who I can\u2019t stand, but we didn\u2019t have any conflict up until now) decided that she wants to leave for vacation in a particular week and needed to get rid of a night shift. \n* I told her that I couldn\u2019t do it for her since that would be 3 night shifts in 5 days which is too much for me. \n* She then attempted to have me switch one of those 3 with another colleague so I could take her shift, which I agreed to, but the only colleague who wanted to switch with me had available shifts only on the birthday of my mother (50th, which she plans to spend with her family including me) and another during my planned vacation. So I had to decline.\n* Her last attempt was to ask me to switch my Sunday night shift with her Friday one. I agreed, under the condition that I get to keep the Sunday pay (this is where I might be an asshole - but I felt that if I do her a favour and take the worse shift she might as well let me keep the money)\n\nShe the started throwing a fit over text, saying that she has been more than accommodating and nice to me (?) and that I should help her since I have less shifts than everybody else. That I always have an excuse why I can\u2019t do a shift (just those two, my mom\u2019s birthday and vacation) and that she won\u2019t be there that week and that I should just figure out what to do with the shift. I told her it\u2019s not my shift so not my problem and gave her my arguments why I think she\u2019s unfair (I did the Christmas-which I took over from her - and Easter shift, the fact that I have enough Fridays, the two months I didn\u2019t do - which she said should be still taken into account, etc). She would not have any of my arguments and said she won\u2019t be there for her shift and to figure it out. \n\nAITA here? I feel she was way out of line, especially since I made two attempts to accommodate her, but on the other hand I guess I could have helped her without expecting anything in return. \n\nTldr: A coworker decided she wants to go on vacation and got mad at me for not taking over a shift that is inconvenient to her, saying that I have less shifts than her and should help her out.","upvote_ratio":0.57,"created_utc":1678640967.0},{"title":"My (24M) gf (26 F) exposed me to oral herpes this morning not sure what to do.

I started to do my investigation and found out about her talking to a supervisor where she works at and the conversation was more than friendly, it wasn\u2019t anything sexual, but the guy was flirting with her and she wasn\u2019t really denying the attention. From the messages I felt like it was a lot of cat and mouse interaction which I feel like it wasn\u2019t serious, but I was also mentioned in the conversation , like her telling him details about our relationship , for example \u201c you have complimented me more than he has the last month\u201d. \nGoing back to the cat and mouse analogy, she did invite her over one day to the house and he asked for the address and I know he was ready but she didn\u2019t go threw with giving him the address and said goodnight, but I felt like when he was pulling away from talking to her she was missing that attention!! That was all going on when she was still with me!!!! By the time I found out about their little friendship, I know that she had ended things with that conversation, she said things like \u201chey I know we are not going to be together, sorry that I won\u2019t be there for you, your a good guy but you need someone better for you\u201d\n\nWhen I told her I knew she was first of all shocked about it because there is no way I would know, but she really seemed to be ashamed and also regretted doing it. She said it was a mistake and that it was a stupid error. \n\nI know it wasn\u2019t anything sexual and they only saw each other at work 3 times barely wouldn\u2019t even talk in person. Also this conversation went on for 3 weeks with the dude. \n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to get out of this is that, she is begging me to go back with her, she said she would do anything to be with me. She said she would work from home, share her location with me. Let me go threw her phone whenever, but I don\u2019t want someone to be loyal to me because they are scared.

He was the one who called the police and my family and lectured me throughout the day about depression but still stated he wanted to break up.  I accepted it and after managing to get out the hospital and avoiding inpatient I ubered to a friend's party.  I'd been blowing her off due to the relationship issues, and she's really the only friend I have left after this whole ordeal.

I'll try and give an accurate run down of what happened but please spare me the moral condemantion as im aware i got myself in this emotional dliemna.\nSo i met my gf at work in auto shop. She started working there as a licensed mechanic and a very good one in june of last year\nShortly after starting we connected immediately on a very deep level through conversation,laughter, and mutual shared weird interests in foods, music, backgrounds, intellectually\u00a0 shared at breakfast and lunch hours as well as breaks then talking after work hours. \n\nHere are some info factors. \n-I was separating from my wife of 28 yrs when we met.\n-she was\/is in a relationship of 4.5 with what i believe is a narcissist and control freak thats older then her .\n- there is and age gap between us with me being older. I am 50 and she is 28. But she says thats what shes attracted to as her other bf is older at 36.\n-She has always stated she found me to be hot, sweet, affectionate, emotional, extremely sexually satisfying and unselfish. Completeley different in ever aspect of her bf\n- she referred to me as her bf and her as my gf.\n-we've been sexually and emotionally together for 8 months\n- she and i have both expressed interest in spending life together and how deeply we care for eachother.\n- we made promises to one another to be there at the endand potect one another. \n\n\nA month later after numerous conversations And bouts of crying shared between us over our relationship problems we became sexual.\nIt quickly became a very intense and highly charged sexual realtionship but then we became very emotionally bonded\u00a0 as well over the following month.\nWe spoke every day dare i say 6-7 hrs between messaging and in person. \n\nShe was still going home to him and sneaking around with me. On our first public date 2 months later we had some very personal and deep conversations where we both disclosed dark screts that no one else in our lives was aware of.\nIt was at that point i knew i wanted to be with her. The level of comfort, and trust to be myself around someone was extraordinary. \nShe said the same.\nFor her bday i went all out baking her the first cake anyone had given or made for her. I gave her some very thoughtful gifts that she loved.\nThen she went home to her narc bf who made no effort to celebrate her special day. I think she was a let down but made an excuse that he spent money on her work boots. \n\nNow here is why i came to conclusion he is a narcissist who is emotionally and pycholgically manipulating her. \n\nI met him at a golf tournament and he had a superiority complex around me while demeaning, mocking, disrespecting\u00a0 his gf with rude comments in front of others.\nHe has various restrictions or expectations of her.\nNo sexy or revealing clothing around him or others, no drinking an sort of alchohol, doesnt want her listening to the music she enjoys as he finds it distasteful, no high heels, doesnt like her going to the gym, will guilt and accuse her of picking fights, never says sorry, and many other controling traits. \n\nShe often felt guilty that she was giving me a negative and innacurate view of him. So i suggested her record one of her fights so we could listen to it together.\nShe did and oh my god what a condescending asshole who manipulates her into accepting responsibilty for fight.\nShe then got her gf to listen also ans was given same opinion as i had stated.\nSo i began to build her confidence and self esteem back up he had stripped her of with positive reinforcement of her qualities. In the recordings i could hear her fear to speak as she struggled to form words with him. Yet with me she was always comfortable to speak and talk about anything. \n\n4 months after we met they had big blowout and he broke up with her. We got closer over the next 2 weeks as i was now living with my dad after the separation. We began looking for place to live. Suddenly out of the blue he asks her to stay and even goes as far as to say he checked out others and they werent as hot as her.\nSo she fell for the speach and false love bombing and went back to him.\nShe wanted to end things with me but after talking with her and asking some real questions of what she wanted in a relationship and future she stayed with me as she reliazed she wasnt going to be happy with him.\nWe continued on for another month when she got an extremly good job offer that was hard to turn the money down for but required working out of town 1week on 1 week off.\nShe took it and her home bf was furious. \nShe did all the cooking, cleaning, house maintenace, auto maint, while he did non of it. So he was going to fend for himself. \n\nShe went and we continued to see eachother\u00a0 as i always drove and picked her up from airport so we could see eachother and talk more. \nOver the months we became more emotionally connected expressing words of i love\u00a0 and making plans for future together and what we wanted to share in life.\nI would say we were in a full bore loving relationship as she regularly told me she couldnt wait to start life with me. \n\nBut she was finding it difficult to leave him as he was doing small things she perceived as him changing. I reminded her that once he got comfortable again he would start with the yelling, name calling, demeaning, demands, guilting, out downs , etc \n\nTrue to form he did exactly that \n\nWe continued on having highly charged sex and very emotional and deep conversations with future plans being made. \n\nI was getting impatient to begin our lives so i bought a condo for us and told her we had a place to live when she leaves him. \n\nShe was excited but still\u00a0 scared to make the transition.\u00a0 \nI kept telling her to leave before he found out about our relationship because if he found out the break up would always be her fault not about his acts of hurting her so he would never take responsibility for his part. \n\nFinally i had to talk with her and told her she needed to basically shit or get off the pot. \n\nSo i posed a question to her and told her to think about it before answering.\nI asked you want to be with me or him? Cause ifbit him then just delete me from your life as though we never met. Friendship, relationship. \n\nAfter\u00a0 15 min she messaged back saying she wanted to spend her life with me and was unwilling to lose me.\nThat same week she and him got into huge fight where he told her she is not his equal and that she was lazy expecting a hand out. \n\nA week\u00a0 later after she emphatically declared wanting to be with me her bf discovered she was cheating on him through seeing our messages. Although\u00a0 he only saw the tamer ones missing any sexual\u00a0 or emotional content. \n\nHe confronted her over message as she was out of town working and on video call with me. \n\nHe sent me a pretty angry message aimed at me through her messaging app since he went on her instagram account which is where we spoke.\nLater she went quiet and i dont know what was said between them but she messaged me \n\n\"I dont think i can be with you either\" \ni remeinded her of our struggles to get here and she was now free. \n\nShe replied that she fucked up and couldnt stay in same city. Basically run away from her problem. \n\nNext day i picked her up at airport and she was different and quiet.\nWhen we got to my condo she told me she had to go back and try\u00a0 and fix what she broke. \n\nI reminded her if he was willing to let her stay she would be agreeing to give up her freedom, and give up the parts of her personality he was slowly stripping her of because of his own believes and selfish needs. \n\nShe replied maybe that the penance\u00a0 she needs to pay for doing this and she drove off despite me crying for to stay and not give up on us. \n\nShe immediately blocked my number so i couldnt call her.\nNext day she began blocking me on all contact methods or social media which i expected him to make her do. \n\nShe did briefly unblock me to say she was going to do damage control and minimize our imvolvement in hopes of fixing things.\nShe also stated she does think about me and miss me. Then went silent till now i havent heard from her \n\nIs she gonna come back?\nIs she going to walk away from the life she emphatically\u00a0 said she wanted to share with me and give up on us? \n\nOr is this her panicked and scared of losing control of her enviroment and she will eventually remember why we were together the past 8.5 months and what we shared? \n\nI believe she is trauma bonded and has some deep routed psychological manipulation embedded by him that makes it hard for her to move on to the better life she wants. \n\nShe often told me she wanted to find the courage to stand up to him but was always scared of his reactions.\n\n\nI know she cheated on her bf. But as i told her it was for the right reasons just wrong method. \n\nGuys im scared she going to forget everything we have and stay to be stripped of her self worth and dignity at his hands.\nHe will always acuse her of being the problem and take away her dreams and she doesnt see it\u00a0 because she thinks she deserves to be punished.\nOne big factor also is in 8.5 months together she was absolutely positive she didnt want kids ever as she was scared of ever being tied to him lime that or going through that experience with an unsupportive partner. \n\nHe wants a family so im scared she will cave to that just to try and make it up to him. \n\nDo you guys think a narcissist\u00a0 will want to stay with her or fix the relationship?\nShe told me and i heard it in audio recordings how detached and unemotional he was with her. \n\nShould i expcet never to hear from her or have i made enough of a good impression over the 8 months of treating her with respect, love, desire, class that she will eventually realize she has something better to go to? \n\nWe spent time together going to the gym, concerts, coffee early mornings, walks, and lots of talking,\u00a0 highly intense sex with many of her kinks explored that she said she couldnt tell anyone about or tell her bf about cause he would call her dirty or just a slut with filthy mind. \n\nThis silence is killing me","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1678652608.0},{"title":"Do I (25F) move half way across the country to see if my boyfriend (26M) wants to be with me?","author":"squeeplock","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11pfo36\/do_i_25f_move_half_way_across_the_country_to_see\/","text":"Content warning: brief mention of SA\n\nI feel ridiculous posting here, but everyone  my life is telling me to do something different and my therapist is out of town on vacation so this is my best option I guess. \n\nWe met on a dating app a year and 9 months ago. I was in a different career and he was just starting grad school. The first two months were amazing and then our lives sort of fell apart. He helped me change careers and he started in a graduate program. \n\nIn the lead up to him starting his program, I got really nervous and jealous of his classmates. I felt like I wasn\u2019t good enough. That\u2019s on me. \nA month after he started I found out he had gone on a date with another girl and had been emotionally cheating with another. I only found this out from going through his phone. \n\nWe stayed together, and things were okay. Not great, but okay. My boss turned out to be a crazy person and I hated my new job. In addition, I had a bit of a crisis where at 24 I found out that I was diagnosed with autism as a child and my family never told me. (My family is pretty terrible generally but this caused a huge crisis of identity and I didn\u2019t handle it very well). This was hard on him, I was incredibly depressed and felt like much of my life could have been easier and leaned into the diagnosis honestly more than I should have. Around this time I found out he had cheated on me again, he had asked out a girl he knew and gone to a party with her. \nThen his life started entirely falling apart. I won\u2019t get into the details because I can\u2019t, but long story short 6 months ago he left the state and his program. I\u2019m still in the state and have been harassed by the girl he cheated on me with for the past few months. \n\nOver the past year I haven\u2019t been myself because of all the stress and this diagnosis. I\u2019ve been very honest with I\u2019m about that. I\u2019ve been in therapy up to 3x\/week to try and manage the stress on top of pre existing ptsd from childhood SA and complex ptsd from emotional abuse. \n\nNow, the plan was for me to move into his apartment with him. Over the past few months, he has asked for multiple breaks. He says he can\u2019t trust me because he doesn\u2019t feel like he knows who I am. He said he\u2019s put me in a different category in his mind, and that he\u2019s no longer attracted to me, but that he wants to be and wants me to come to see if he could be. I\u2019ve told him I\u2019m quite different from when he left 6 months ago meaning that I\u2019ve been doing a lot of work in therapy and I feel much better about myself and my position in life. He\u2019s now proposed that I can move there and move in with him starting at square zero, so we\u2019d entirely start over. I know that it\u2019s all he can offer because he feels like he doesn\u2019t know me, but I grew up in a situation where I felt like I had to earn love and affection and I worry that I\u2019ll be walking into a situation that feels like earning love. \n\nI love him more than anyone. I don\u2019t have family, he\u2019s become my family and I really really don\u2019t want to lose him. I either need to accept my job offer at a new company here on Monday and find a new apartment in my current city, or accept an offer there and move in with him in 12 days. \n\nLast night we had a conversation where I said I couldn\u2019t come under those conditions because I\u2019d only be moving for him and he doesn\u2019t want me to move only for him. In the emotional mess of everything I forgot that I had a job interview on Monday that I\u2019m actually excited about for a job there and I asked if we could talk then so I wouldn\u2019t be moving just for him. He insisted that I had broken up with him and was really upset with me when I said I hadn\u2019t and wanted to work through things. We ended the phone call with him saying technically we\u2019re not broken up and that we\u2019d talk the next day. \nI have no idea what I\u2019m supposed to do. Any advice or help at all would be greatly appreciated. \n\nEdit: for further context, he helped me leave behind my incredibly abusive family and has supported me through going no contact with them. I know he loves me. \n\nTLDR: I have less than 5 days to decide between breaking up, or moving in with him. I have two weeks left at my job, I put my notice in already and someone had signed to sublet my apartment.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678630908.0},{"title":"I 33F am dating a man child 37M and its exhausting!","author":"hw0488","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11pomk9\/i_33f_am_dating_a_man_child_37m_and_its_exhausting\/","text":"I have been dating my bf for a year and a half; I am the kind of person who wants to live life, have fun and get out and do things, he is very much a gamer, introvert and wants to sit around, smoke weed endlessly and do nothing.\n\nWe met online, and he made me believe that we were very much into the same activities and interests, after a few months in, it seemed that he was very much into gaming\/smoking weed, than really doing anything else, where I am an outdoorsy, social person who wants to get out and do things, as I have a hard time sitting around doing nothing.

My boyfriend (22) and I (20) have been together for almost 8 months. The problem is that I have a serious problem with people who rage over video games.  I like to play for fun and I've always been around chill people.  But he always takes everything seriously and that's problematic for me.  When playing, he complains and shout a lot.\nI grew up in a home where screaming was a sign of violence and it traumatized me a lot.  I can't stand any sign of anger anymore (from anyone), even if it's not against me.  It just makes me panic.  \nOf course, I talked to him about it MANY times.  I told him that I couldn't hear him screaming anymore when he plays, at first he told me he was going to make an effort but I have the impression that it's getting worse and worse.  \nEvery time he screams, I have a horrible feeling in my body for a few seconds, like I'm devoid of stress.  I don't know how to explain it, but it's a really awful feeling.  This feeling only happens when he plays next to me. When we are calling, it doesn't scares me, it just annoys me deeply.  \nI've been particularly sensitive lately. I spent a few days at his home and every time I heard him scream because of the game, it made me stressed and I end up crying.  He asked me what was going on, I told him that I couldn't take it anymore.  The problem is that he plays in a professional team and therefore video games are his whole life.  He explains to me that he wants to accomplish his dream despite everything and that he is finally about to accomplish his goal but that if at each end of the game he sees me crying, he will never be able to achieve it.  It really makes me feel guilty.   \nHe often tells me that he needs me to support him in what he does, but it's so hard.  He tells me that I don't accept him as he is.  We almost broke up a few days ago, because I was crying again from his screaming. He just got mad. He tells me that  when he yell, he's not mad at me and that I have to understand that.  But I do know it, but it doesn't change anything..  \nI really, really love him.  But I can't support him in his project.  I would like to, but I just can't. For me now, him playing games means rage and so sadness n anger.\nYet I know he needs my support.  I want to be a best girlfriend for him but this situation is really, really upsetting me.  I used to play video games a lot but I stopped because playing with him was simply impossible, he's not having fun.  I don't want to leave him, beyond that he really takes care of me.

So to give a backstory we have been on and off for the past 3 years. His turning 25 soon. We have a beautiful baby girl and boy (not twins but they are Irish twins). During our time together we\u2019ve had our ups and downs and when we had our downs\u2026they were bad. I\u2019ve stuck with him through homelessness, him cheating, him abusing me physically, mentally and spiritually, him belittling me and much more. It\u2019s getting to the point now where he blames everything on me and I no longer cry at our arguments. I\u2019m tired of being his family and his punching bag. Prime example tonight was a wild one. We both just got thru arguing with his mom. She wanted to state that no one is giving her money for the bills but yet we\u2019re putting $700+ in grocery\u2019s and buying all the household products on top of getting our children needs. Neither one of us have a good job we both do DoorDash. So we don\u2019t have that much money and every time she gets money it doesn\u2019t goes toward the bills instead it goes towards bottles of liquor, her smoking habits and a man that really don\u2019t want her. So after he told his mom this I spoke up and said I\u2019m the one putting food in here and buying products so people can wipe their ass and wash their clothes. That triggered her and she put her hands on me to which everything escalated to the cops being called. Somehow his blaming me for not helping him, not being quiet when he told me too (which I reminded him you get slap and try to remain quiet) and so forth.\n\nUPDATE: this morning she tried to start another mess. Like I said I have two small children (a 1 y\/o and almost 2) that were sleeping in the room with me and she tried to hook up her speaker in front of my door and play loud music but before she did her son (my bf\/bd) stopped her and she didn\u2019t like that and she even hit him and busted his lip.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678600037.0},{"title":"My fianc\u00e9 31m is going on holiday while I 33f am at home dealing with a pregnancy loss","author":"Snowshow898","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11poalv\/my_fianc\u00e9_31m_is_going_on_holiday_while_i_33f_am\/","text":"So many people are messaging asking for an update from my previous post.

It stopped and I can't move on.  \n\n\nI find it very very hard to catch feelings for a person. For a time, I thought I was aromantic. I think I ever actually wanted to be with someone only once in my life (and I was 16). I've had multiple chances with multiple women but never once did I want to continue. \n\nThis time, I found myself fallen for two people at the same time. This is not a love triangle though. Hear me out:\n\nI study electrical engineering. As you can probably guess, there aren't many women around. I've made friends with lots and lots of people, but then I found these two girls, Maya and Dylan. They were roommates and they contacted me because they needed help with a math problem. I helped them, then we started to hang out in a friend group and eventually it was just the three of us. I've never seen them as more than friends, I enjoyed their company because they were funny, smart, and we were aligned in most of our values and life philosophies. They were very attractive but they had some major character flaws which made it unreasonable to do anything more with them (this is very important for the later part of this story).\n\nEventually, we became closests friends (at least that's what they were telling me).\n\nWe got drunk after a final exam once, just the three of us. This was about a year into our friendship. Drunkedly, they told me they slept together twice before. This surprised me as I had no idea there was any kind of attraction between them (also a very important detail for later). Emboldened by their honesty, I jokingly said - \"We would be a perfect material for a threesome, what do you think?\"\n\nOne of them said: \"I've actually been waiting for someone to say this.\"\n\nFor the next few months, we had regular threesomes and I couldn't be more happier. It was every guy's dream, I enjoyed their company, we were close friends and I had no obligations one would have in a relationship. We spent every day together. There were red flags I was overlooking (my number one mistake). However, to my surprise, I found myself falling for them - that's where this kind of intimacy, physical or emotional, gets you.\n\nHowever, after three or four months of doing this, they said something they probably should have told me a LONG time ago. They told me they were lesbians and that they were in a commited relationship together for 5 years. I swear to god, I had NO IDEA. There was 0 intimacy between them outside the bed.\n\nThere was a problem though. I've managed to fall in love with both of them at the same time. I knew I fell for them when I found myself getting sad after not seeing them for prolonged periods of time, when I found myself feeling good ol' fashioned jealousy after seeing them talk to another guy. I couldn't tell them about this, as I knew that would jeopardize the entire thing (my mistake number two).\n\nIt's probably high time I tell you something about the red flags I've mentioned multiple times in this post. Maya and Dylan had no other friends except me and some guys they talked to regularly. They had female friends before but all of them left this duo because D and M thought \"they were too dramatic\". Also, there were instances where they've shown that they are ready to drop me at a moment's notice. For example, I forgot whether they wanted apple or orange juice from a grocery store. Their response to this was ghosting me for a week for this (and I already was traumatized from ghosting and they KNEW it would hurt me). Another example was that they never apologized for hurting me in any way, for screaming at me, for verbal abuse, anything. They were always ready to tell me the worst possible things one could tell to another person - real ugly stuff, like telling me I'm never going to find anyone to care about me, that all men are useless and I was the prime example, etc.\n\nAnother thing was that they never told me what was wrong. They convinced each other about something bad about me and only after their little echo chamber exploded did they scream at me for something I didn't even know happened.\n\nThen the intimacy gradually slowed down. There were bigger and bigger gaps between the threesomes and I started to panic - though I'm no stranger to this, I didn't do anything. I only asked them whether something was wrong because we never went a month without sex. They said nothing was wrong. I was too scared to ask more.\n\nAfterwards, they spoke to me less and less, called me to hang out less and less, but I didn't spam them or pressure them, though I was very sad and missed them terribly. \n\nI told to myself: If they wanted to have me in their life, they would make it so. Therefore I stopped responding immediately after they reached out and I showed less enthusiasm. This, however, made them want my attention more, and as they were like a drug to me, I accepted.\n\nThis was going on for MONTHS and I was in emotional torture - I wanted to be with them but they were extremely mean to me and the intimacy hasn't resumed. Every positive interaction we had, no MATTER how miniscule it was, convinced me that we could go back to what we were.\n\nWe had the last fight after I asked calmly about the state of our relationship. They responded in a very harsh way, then proceeded to ghost me - but they only ghost me in our group chats, they respond to my messages in bigger group chats even though my messages don't concern them and weren't aimed at them. They no longer text me about random stuff, no longer talk to me about what troubles them.\n\nI know I have to end this. I know there is nothing that can come out of this. I've tried dating other people but nothing can compare to how I felt with them. I don't think I can ever replace two girls with one. I know it's not sustainable and I know it's not healthy. I just don't know how to proceed because I can't really talk to anyone about this. When this was going on, I tried to do all the right choices, I talked to my twin sister, I talked to my other female good friends, I just tried to be healthy and respectful. I just don't know how to stop wanting them and what they gave me.","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678651360.0},{"title":"26m 24f The relationship is certain throughout this time","author":"ThrowRA3252352355232","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11po5n2\/26m_24f_the_relationship_is_certain_throughout\/","text":"It is certain the relationship throughout this time is the relationship to consider.

He texted me a long apology that he made a mistake and wanted to come over to\nThe hotel and speak in person. He was begging for me back and it turned out to him spending the night cuz I felt bad. He went downstairs to my car to go grab his ties or something he needed for work\u2026.. and he left my door unlocked \n\nLiterally EVERYTHING WAS GONE. I only\nHad my purse and the clothes on my back. I was shocked and violated and yelled why didn\u2019t you lock my door dude ??? Wtf ??? He\u2019s like oh I thought I did. He only bought me a few things of makeup and 2 pairs of pants and 6 shirts to make up for what I lost. \n\nHe knows how bad I need a computer right now and does nothing to help me. If it wasn\u2019t for him not leaving my door unlocked I would have all my stuff. He does not let me get a break . He says it not his fault a crackhead did it so can\u2019t be mad at him. \n\nI don\u2019t think this is fair at all. If I left someone\u2019s door  unlocked and they were robbed of everything beside the clothes on their back I would do everything I could to help them replace what I lost. He doesn\u2019t. He stands and watches me struggling to buy clothes and shoes that I lost. He told me I don\u2019t need my laptop bc I barley used it. There was important stuff on there dude. \n\nNow the icing on the cake is he\u2019s been gambling every single day and blowing anywhere from 100 dollars to 2500 dollars a night. Today is the 7th day in a row he went. It makes me so mad to see him throw money down the casino instead of helping me get back to where I was before I was robbed. He also knows how much I hate casinos as the reason bc my ex was addicted To it and he lost our entire life and I had to place my child to live with family bc he broke us. And so now my bf has picked up this same habit addiction ? \n\nHe always makes it a point that I know how much money the flowers he got me cost   . Like he\u2019s doing me a huge favor by getting me flowers instead of one pair of shoes. I don\u2019t know if i could ever treat someone like that. If  I was the reason their stuff was stolen I would help \u2026 not sit and film me struggle. I really want to move on from him as his casino problems are only worsening and I don\u2019t see light at the end of the tunnel anymore. I feel crazy sometime. I just don\u2019t get how one person can sit in the casino 5-7 hours a day and not help his robbed of everything girlfriend.","upvote_ratio":0.73,"created_utc":1678599387.0},{"title":"Demanded 30 M boyfriend show me 21 F credit card statements...","author":"darkchococat","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11pnvp6\/demanded_30_m_boyfriend_show_me_21_f_credit_card\/","text":"Only because we are supposed to get a place together and I didn't know that he owes around $5000 on two cards total... he is paying it off and used to only pay the minimum so his credit score is good (he showed me). Kind of weird to me that he didn't tell me sooner considering we are going to get a place together and rent 50\/50. It's understandable to have money to owe on credit cards but he told me he used them to cover his rent at his old apartment which he said I didn't need to pay rent at that time (I couldn't afford it). At the time I was under the impression he had enough money saved up to pay for it... which he must have had a decent amount saved considering how long he lived there. So now I am suggesting he get a second job in addition to his job 40 hours a week (which he was working the mandatory overtime there in December) and to never spend more than 30% of the credit line and avoid paying rent on credit unless there's some sort of emergency... I don't think I should have to demand he show me his finances though he should just be willing to be to show me like I show him mine at random.

She\u2019s obviously extremely low libido, this is likely do to a mix of her depression and some female reproductive health issues she has (she has multiple ovarian cyst syndrome) and I\u2019ve been understanding of that but lately it\u2019s kinda hit me that this isn\u2019t a temporary thing, neither of those things go away or are curable. \n\nNot only this but the few times we do have sex she is extremely selfish. I love fire play (edit: foreplay* I am a pyro but we don\u2019t play with it together lol) but she wants to skip straight to penetration, I\u2019m by no means some sex god but I know my gfs buttons so I can usually make her climax within 10-15 minutes with just penetration. Normally this would be awesome\u2026unfortunately my gf is a one a done person, it\u2019s very common for her to climax and just be too sensitive to continue, again normally no problem except when I say done I mean done completely, like she wants to go straight to after care and I\u2019m left still aroused and frustrated. \n\nI by contrast am very very high sex drive and over the years the lack of interest has been detrimental to my self confidence especially sexually that has manifested in performance anxiety and sometimes not even being able to stay hard without constant stimulation.\n\nI love her a lot and the thought of leaving hurts me a lot to think about but I feel like this is an issue that will only get worse. We both are still in college so the logical side of my brain argues that it\u2019s better to bite the bullet while we are both still young but I\u2019m not sure. \n\nWhat do you all think, is sexual compatibility really that big of a deal breaker?

She is not against trying stuff, but the energy and enthusiasm is not there as if I were dating a kinky girl. This is also the first and only girl I've dated, though I've had a few girls tell me over the years they were attracted to me. The thing is the sex is ok and safe, nothing crazy and wild. I make her cum, she makes me cum, maybe we do a little intercouse in between. Sometimes I'll ask to bring out the ropes \/ chains \/ whips and she'll oblige but be scared \/ nervous the whole time, and no matter how much I try it just doesn't seem enjoyable. Like for example, I can ask for a blowjob and she will oblige but if I don't ask she'll just drop some spit in her hands and rub one out. It works, but it's not 10 levels deep of connection that i crave. I don't know if it's something I've been avoiding, if the issue is with her, or just my own perception and me not communicating.\n\nI suffered an injury a few years ago and went down a spiral of smoking pot and gaining a lot of weight.

I've been a part of the family for five years. My girlfriend and I have been together and living together for two years. Her brother didn't move in until he hit a rough patch late last year. Previously, he refused to have any sort of contact with the family since he had first moved out, long before I moved in. Since moving in, he has been a major pain in the ass. He lacks respect for all of us in minor ways, but it adds up and causes a lot of tension in the house. His mom keeps making excuses for him because she is just happy to have her son back despite being nearly intolerable to all of us, including herself. We were all happier without him, it's sad to say. We had a great family dynamic (however unconventional), but now we all retreat to our corners of the house, consciously, or perhaps unconsciously avoiding him.\n\nThe issue: Months back, I had come home from work to find only BIL was home. My girlfriend was staying the night at a friend's. My MIL was having a night out. I was super stressed out from work, and since I didn't have my girlfriend to bother with my work problems, I vented to her brother. Just ranting my angry little heart out, still in uniform. Her brother goes on to say, \" 'GF' is at a friend's house, and mom is at the bar, so it's just you and me.\" My brain was at 0% power. I thought the statement was obvious and a bit odd, but I didn't think much of it at the time. It gets worse. He offered some of the alcohol he had lying around. Great. I've had a horrible day, I would love to chill out! Then it started to dawn on me. He was going to try to sleep with me. I retreated to my room and just tried to forget it ever happened.\n\nIt has been bothering me ever since. I have been letting it eat me up inside for months. I am so uncomfortable whenever he is around. I hadn't brought it up to anyone else in the house because as much as I'm loved by my MIL and my GF, it's a messy situation. I feel like maybe I'm crazy for feeling so disgusted and violated even though nothing actually happened. I don't want to ruin their family when I am not part of it by blood. I also have a lot of trauma and I wasn't believed by my actual mother when things were happening to me in my own home. \n\nI told my girlfriend today because I just couldn't take it anymore. I was trying to protect her, but I couldn't hold it inside anymore. I hadn't realized just how much it has been affecting me until I told her. I don't know how to go about it with MIL. I don't know how I should bring it up, and I'm scared she isn't going to take it as seriously as it is for me because of all the excuses she has made for his less offensive shitty behaviors. I don't know if this will be the last straw for her in dealing with his crap, or if she will hate me instead of him. I need advice and validation in my feelings towards this situation, if that is possible from you all.

However, I've gone into so much detail about our relationship, if she finds this, then she will probably know its her (especially because I later word-for-word repeat a message she sent me).\n\nTL;DR: My girlfriend (of a couple months), but best-friend of 7 years, broke up with me because she thought she can't give me what she thinks I need at her due to her life circumstances, but she didn't want to break up, seems upset about it, and still loves me.\n\nI don't really know how to start this, haha. so I'll just get to the topic at hand, and prepare for a longg read because I'm not really sure what parts I should leave out, so I've said a lot.\n\nBasically, my girlfriend broke up with me a few days ago (last Tuesday), and admittedly, we only have been dating a \\*\\*very\\*\\* short time, but we have been best-friends for years. Despite all our difficulties in our friendship, such as her moving schools and an fallout between me and another mutual friend, we stayed connected. My friendship with her was like no other that I've had before, I always used to lose contact with people when either of us moved away, but not her. She came into my life at such a difficult time, I was hurt badly and was recently diagnosed with a chronic condition. I was scared of opening up to other people and finding new friends outside of my existing friend group. However, there was just something different about her and we just \"clicked\". We kept in contact inconsistently and didn't see much of each other after she moved schools, but we still considered each other best-friends, we could tell each other things that we haven't told anyone else, and I slowly started falling for her. Whenever we hanged out, most of the time, it was doing something \"grand\". Going to day-trips to the nearby city, going to the theme-park, and going camping together.\n\nI always got mixed-signals from her. I don't believe it was intentional, and she said it wasn't. However, during our last camping trip in January, there was so many mixed signals, but a lot of it was hinting that she liked me. She fell asleep a few times, hugging me quite deeply and holding my hand. My friend was seeing those mixed signals as well and was getting really confused, but all that (plus my mum's and my friend's encouragement) led me to tell her my feelings after the camping trip.\n\nAt first she rejected me, but that was because of her past relationships never went well, and I believe she suffers from severe PTSD from them, so she tried to burry any romantic feelings she had. However, me telling her my feelings, brought them to the surface. The following week was very complicated, she kept texting me and several mutual friends, very confusing messages, like she was trying to convince herself a relationship wasn't a good idea, but by the end of the week she asked me out.\n\nThe first couple dates we planned never actually happened because her parents were in the process of moving, and she kept having to cancel them. However, after a couple weeks, we finally managed to go on our first date and we absolutely instantly clicked romantically with one another.\n\nWe kissed (and \\*tried\\* making out), fell asleep in the sun, and watched the sunset on top of a hill near where we lived. She admitted she was really nervous about dating again because of how hurt she was in the past. However, she wanted to give us a try.\n\nWe had 3 other dates after that because of her parents always dragging her away to do things, and her getting busy with work, and we hanged out 2-3 other times between those dates (it was probably the most we ever hanged out during a single month). She trusted me with one of her biggest and deepest secrets, we told each other we loved each other so much, and we \\*almost\\* went all the way twice.\n\nWe both were really happy, she made me feel things that no one has ever made me feel (and she told me the same), she told me that I could be \"the one\", and that she would choose me over anybody else, that I treated her better then anyone else ever did (even her parents), and we started planning to do so much together in the future like moving in, and getting pets together, and going on so many trips (although we already did have one planned in a couple years time). But then we both started university.... We both go to different universities. They're only about 30 minutes from each other, and we only live 20 minutes apart. But we both started to get really bad anxiety about this working out. However, I believed we could make it through, and she did at first as well at first, so did as our previously mentioned mutual friend (who was rooting for us). However, I think her PTSD was getting to her since she was worried that I would find somebody else at university while I was still dating her since because of her insanely busy schedule, we might've only been able to hangout every month or two. Additionally, she was getting really worried about her not being able to give me what I need or want out of a relationship, when all I ever wanted was her. I might've been unhappy with us not being able to spend much time together, but that would've made the time we did spend together, so much better and meaningful.\n\nI do take some of the blame for making her feel like she can't give me what I need though. I asked her if we could start calling more often, when she's happy just texting, and when she cancelled one of our plans that we've been planning since before our relationship, I got upset because it wasn't the first time she cancelled on me. I said something along the lines of \"What's the point of us always discussing plans when you almost always cancel or change your mind about things either the next day, or a couple days later, or last minute. It's upsetting me and making me scared that one day you'd change your mind about me\", since because she did it so often, and another one of our mutual friends said it felt like she was doing it on purpose, and that got into my head. She responded with \"If you don't like my busyness and my incontinency, then I'm not the one for you. I normally cancel because of my family, but with uni and work, it's just going to get worse and worse as time goes on\". I responded to that with \"Am I Important to you? Will you come to my side when I need you, like I would for you.\" Admittedly, I could've worded that better, or I shouldn't have said it at all, because I knew that she would be, in one way or another, even if it wasn't straight away, and when we eventually managed to find time to hang out, it would make it even better. And while she did say that I was important to her, that she still loves me and that she cares for me. She said that \"I don't think I have time to focus on you in the way you want and I don't think I will for a long time. I honestly don't want to hurt you by putting through all this waiting. I love you and care about you but I know I can't give you the happiness you need or deserve. I have realised over the last few weeks I don't have the time to maintain a serious relationship at the moment and I'm sorry to disappoint you but I can't manage it with everything on my plate at this current point in time. You deserve better. I've given this a go and as much as I love you and spending with with you I feasibly can't maintain this long term.\"\n\nWe later had a bigger discussion over the break up over call, and she was basically said that she was unhappy with her life at the moment, her physical health isn't okay and she is stressed out with work and uni, and she thinks can't give me what I need or want. I told her that all I need is her, and she thinks she can't give me that, and she is scared that if we continue our relationship, that I'd become\n\nthe last person she ever wants to see (She didn't tell me why but I believe it's because of her PTSD and the cheating thing I mentioned earlier) She wants to remain friends and still wants to hangout with me, we still have a plan to hangout in a few months, but that's for my sister's drama performance. Towards the end of the phone call, she said that she needed space, and was on the verge of tears as well. I've talked to one of our mutual friends, and before she broke up with me, he asked if she wanted to break up with me, and she told him that she didn't want to break up with me but obviously she did anyway.\n\nAfter we broke up, she texted me the next day asking if I'm okay (I think because my mum asked her to), and I answered honestly that I wasn't okay. I didn't say why but she probably knew. She also reassured me that we were going to stay friends and that I won't lose her (even though, It feels like I'm losing a piece of her that we developed in our relationship). I've texted her everyday (except today) making sure she's okay and just to catchup on each other's day. However, she was being quite distant with me (she's normally quite distant, but more distant than usual), but seemed okay talking to me, even once replying instantly to my message when I texted her. She goes into huge detail about her day, and things like that but the conversation doesn't last long until she says she has to go, and a couple times it was because I brought something up about our relationship. I believe she is in pain about us breaking up, and I'm scared that she is just going to burry her feelings like she did before I told her how I felt. I keep thinking that someone pressured her into breaking up with me like her parents because they are quite controlling (and not supportive) of her, especially since she did tell me that she \"discussed\" breaking up with me with her parents, and I don't really know if they like me or not, or maybe it was her PTSD that made her feel like she had to because she was getting too attached and was getting terrified of getting hurt like she has so many times in the past.\n\nI admittedly have been such a mess over the breakup, my mental health has seriously declined, I've been having panic attacks and basically been crying almost non-stop, and I believe it's starting to effect my chronic illness, I'm probably really need some therapy right now. I feel like I'm annoying\/overwhelming my friends and family so much over this. She is my best friend, and my first true love. We fell so deeply in love so quickly, and I've liked her for such a long time that I barely paid any attention to anyone else (I believe it's because I may be demiromantic?). I opened my heart to her so widely, and she did the same with me. However, she has crushed it and I feel absolutely broken, and I worthless and pathetic, like I'm not worth fighting for even if someone loves me. or that our relationship was just a distraction for her until University started, because it was only 2 weeks in (now week 3), and we just haven't found time together yet. However, I believe if we continue our relationship, we can find something to do together or find some time together, even if it's just once or twice a month. It's better then nothing, better then not having what we had developed in our relationship. A couple days before the break up, she told me that \"We will be okay\", and that \"You have nothing to worry about\". However, she still broke up with me. She also said that \"We need to speak about these things\" regarding some of my insecurities. However, she broke up with me after I told her one of mine that I was having about her cancelling all the time. She also told me that texting her everyday was a little much for her, even though the Wednesday before the breakup, I could tell something was off with her, and offered her a couple days of space. However, she responded saying that \"No, I don't need space, I really enjoy talking to you, I'm just feeling a little socially exhausted at the moment so it may take me longer to respond then usual, on top of my busyness\".\n\nI keep overthinking everything, like \"was what we had real to her\", \"did she mean what she said\", \"what did she mean by this...\", \"why did she tell me we would be fine if she was thinking about this over the past couple weeks\". I keep trying to think of what to say to her, in hopes I could get her to give us a second chance but not harass her about it. and\/or I want to her to answer all my questions that are in my mind regarding the breakup and maybe it could help my mental health a bit, by understanding why. And I was about to tell\/ask her everything yesterday, I finally worked out what to say. However, by the time she got off work and saw my message about me wanting to talk, she couldn't speak over the phone, and I didn't want to tell her all this over text. I didn't initially tell her what I wanted to speak to her about but I told her that \"I was going through a lot at the moment\" because I wanted to wait until she could speak over the phone today. Later in the conversation, she said she wanted space, not because I did anything wrong, but because she was socially exhausted and was \"hibernating from people\", but she could help me with the problem, and I responded with \"That may not be a good idea if you want space\", which she responded with \"You need to talk, so I can try my best to talk\", but then I said \"Yeah but I'm afraid it's going to overwhelm you too much\" and she figured out that I wanted to talk about us, and a little after she basically said she was going to bed.\n\nI didn't contact her today, since she said she needed space and I want to respect that (no matter how hard it is and how much I'm hurting), and now I'm honestly afraid that if I talk to her about what I need to, that she is just going to push me away even more then she is already. I don't think it's fair for her to let her know how much I'm suffering, how much I'm hurting, and I don't want to make her think that I'm harassing her or for her get back together with me because she feels bad for me. But to me, I think she is hurting over the break up, especially since she was on the verge of tears over the phone, and that our mutual friend said that she didn't want to, and that's why she wants space. That's why she doesn't talk for long (because she's getting emotional), why she hasn't changed our message background on Instagram (we always use Instagram to talk) from all the hearts (even though she initially didn't like it because she didn't like one of the colours), why she still talks to me despite wanting space (because maybe she doesn't really but talking to me is too much for her?), and why she hasn't deleted our shared \"romantic\" playlist from her Spotify account yet (she deleted our road trip playlist from the camping trip almost immediately after the camping trip was over). The only thing I can see that she has done from my end is that she removed me from Find My Friends, which we enabled shortly after when we started dating, I haven't disabled my location with her yet though, because I trust her with it (I'm assuming she stopped sharing her location with me because she has been harassed before my ex's about getting back together with her, and she didn't want me following her about; she hasn't removed me from her snap-map though). I honestly don't know how long I should wait before reaching out to her since she said she needed space, and I'm scared that she won't reach out to me once she is ready.\n\nI really don't want to lose what we had together, especially after such a short-lived but so meaningful and pure relationship, and I'm scared that even if I don't get our relationship back, that she will feel really awkward about hanging out with me and that I will eventually completely lose her, even though she said she doesn't want to lose me and that she still wants to keep hanging out. Especially doing our annual camping trips, and so many other plans we made when we were both dating and were friends (such as travelling to Europe). I have quite a few mutual friends saying that we can work things out, and that we can probably get back together in the future, but I just really don't know what to do here, and I'm feeling so lost, and no one I know has any advice for me.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice for helping me with this? About how I should approach talking to her, or how I could possibly get her back? How long should I wait before contacting her if she doesn't contact me first? and if we do just remain friends, how can I make her feel comfortable around me again? Just anything would be much appreciated.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678648675.0},{"title":"I (24F) want an open relationship, my partner of over a year (33M) isn\u2019t comfortable.","author":"Electrical-Potato352","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11pxxlo\/i_24f_want_an_open_relationship_my_partner_of\/","text":"I\u2019ve been with my partner for a year and a half and since the start, I\u2019ve always been forward and open about wanting to keep the relationship open as I\u2019m still young and am still experimenting.\n\nLast week I had the conversation with my partner about wanting to have sex with a friend in particular and we came to an arrangement that we were happy with. \n\nThis was all well and good until I went to said friend\u2019s house for drinks and came home to my partner incredibly upset, angry and hurt and decided it wouldn\u2019t work for him.

Anyway, after he was on the trip I realized his trip only 8 days planned, but he is going to stay 10 days. I asked about it, and he said \"yeahhhh me and my friends planned to stay longer because of the flights way cheaper two days later\" \u0131 felt weird because if he told me I probably go \"yeah of course good idea\" but because I found out by myself I felt weird. Anyway, later on he went to clubbing with the whole trip. Before he went, I asked for pictures when he was having fun, you know. He sent me only one picture, and he was not even in it, just cool lights at the club. Next day i asked for more pictures after like third time, and he sends me a picture with bunch of girls in the trip I never saw before and with one of them cheek to cheek pose!! My stomach drop to my ass. I felt sooooooo weird and bad. I said \"Congrats on new girlfriend\" he said \"just a pictureee nothing else. You are taking this a different way, I'm just trying to enjoy my trip\". Before even dating I set my boundaries with him (don't want super close girls around him, sloppy sticky girls no go for me). And we are coming from different cultures, I am middle eastern and he is European. And in the other pictures his body language is more like cross armed not touching anyone but girls are super touchy, touching his shoulder and back. I told him \"Long distance is fucking hard, but you don\u2019t have to cross boundaries because I\u2019m simply not there.\" and he said\"I have not done anything bad\" and then I said \"I really love you, I trust you with my whole heart but just these days feel only one-sided, and I feel your attention going somewhere else.

Our relationship has been pretty stable for almost all of it. We didn't start having some issues until we moved in together about 3 years ago. \n\nI come from an extremely tight knit Italian family and shes from an extremely toxic broken household. She still has a relationship with her parents but it's not a great one. I think it goes without saying that my relationship with my parents and family is extremely positive. I love spending time with them throughout the week and it's something that brings me a lot of happiness in my life. I try to see my family about 3 times a week, maybe for about 4-5 hours total per week. I think that is pretty reasonable and in my opinion isn't overdoing it, but you guys can give me your opinion. \n\nMy fiance has recently started to see a therapist due to her Antisocial personality, anxiety\/depression disorder, and ADHD. She has recently sat me down to question whether my priority is my family or her. She said the therapist had told her to have this conversation with me because if my priority is not her then our relationship would not work out. I told her that it's extremely difficult to choose one over the other but when it comes down to it she would be my priority. \n\nI know she has major anxiety spending time with other people. I try to respect her comfortability when asking if she would like to join in on social events with family or friends. I usually say something like, \"my family is having a get together tonight, you are invited and are welcome to come but you don't have to if you're not feeling it.\" This had never been brought up as a problem until she started asking where my priorities lie.\n\nJust to add a bit of context, we spend a lot of time together. We spend most of our weekends together and almost all of our dinners together. We plan outings frequently so that we stay connected and build our relationship. \n\nSo back to our conversation about priorities. It involved me having to ask her permission to attend a family\/friend event instead of assuming it's okay that I can just go. We ended up agreeing on it but it also felt kind of suffocating, which I had expressed to her. \n\nFast forward a couple of days since we had that conversation and I said to her, \"My family is having a get together in honor of my Grandmothers (who passed 2 years ago no) birthday. I'm going to go and you are welcome to come along if you feel comfortable.\" \n\nThis caused her to have an attitude. She responded by saying \"The way you phrased that shows me that you prioritize your family over me. You could have asked me if it was okay for you to go but instead you had already assumed and stated that you were going to go.\" I was kind of shocked with this response and started to get a little emotional but kept my cool. I stated that I was trying to phrase things so that she didn't feel obligated to come but it's something that is important to me.\n\nWe were both aggravated about what had just happened so we decided to have the rest of the conversation once we cool off. \n\nI honestly don't even know what to say when we decide to finish this conversation. I feel like she is trying to have more control over me than I would like. \n\nWhat do you guys think about this situation and how to best handle it?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678648416.0},{"title":"My (39M) boyfriend is loosing interest in me (20M) and spending most of his time with the new girlfriend (21F) he met a month ago.","author":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11pmz2w\/my_39m_boyfriend_is_loosing_interest_in_me_20m\/","text":"Disclaimer : there are loads of detail about this I cannot add-on simply because it'll get the post insta-banned by Reddit\/Mods, so please stick to the info below.\n\nTwo years ago, I left my country for studies, and a month afterwards I met my man, while I was in a very \"difficult\" state (aka. drugged and ill), he took care of and got me a job (working for him) and a house (not that I lacked one, but his was bigger I guess) . We grew closer, even though we weren't supposed to as it would mess with my work and his by extent, to the point where he started calling me his boyfriend (and I guess I reciprocated). The more whatever this is went on, the more controlling and abusive he got; just recently he decided that from now on, our relationship will no longer be \"open\" on my part as he didn't like seeing me get close with other men\/women. Whereas in same time, he had been getting closer than ever with a girl we met at a club a month ago, to the extent that she has literarily taken over my place in his life. They do everything together : shopping, eating, clubbing; except for the sleeping, that still falls upon me. He says that she is just a good friend and that I'm free to join anytime, but the last time I did, the girl spent more time with me than him and he told her to \"fuck off\" out of spite.

I really need to talk to someone. \n\nSo my boyfriend and I are in a long-distance relationship and we've been dating for almost three years. He is from the same town as me but he works abroad and he started that years before we got together. We see each other every 2-3 months. \n\nHe's been a lot of work since the beginning of our relationship because he had a lot of bad habits which he gave up on during these three years. Last time he went back to work (2 months ago) he reassured me that all his bad habits are a matter of the past now and he's a changed man. These 2 months have been wonderful, I've never seen him so responsible. But this weekend he went out with his co-workers (also his friends that are my friends too). They went out drinking, and I know how that goes. He doesn't necessarily does anything wrong but the drinking tends to last from friday all the way to sunday night. He hasn't gone out in the past 2 months, but this weekend really made me realise that I can't have him go out again like that because if he gets a little drunk, then he just wants more and ends up going home really late, barely talking to me all evening and getting annoyed if I call him. \n\nI'm not a controling girlfriend if he is like he's been in the last months, but when he does shit like that I get really frustrated and tired of this relationship. I know he loves me, he's been sending me money to keep for the both of us, he's been sending money for the house (we live with my parents, and they really love him, and all four of us have been talking about out wedding that might be in 2 or 3 years - that's what he told me). He told me he wants to try to work in our country so we can be close to each other, even though the salary is a joke here. \n\nBut even with that, I can't seem to understand this habit of his. I am afraid he will start drinking regularly again. His friends are a horrible influence and he can't do anything about that 'cause they live together. \n\nThe problems this weekend so far:\n\u25cf He went out friday night. I was a little disappointed but I told him to have fun, knowing what will come. \n\u25cf He got home really late and really drunk. \n\u25cf We talked pretty much the whole evening but everything was about his night-out and how much he's going to stay, etc\n\u25cf The next day he woke up late, we talked and agreed that is best he stays home that night. He slept for 5 more hours and then told me he was going out again, that it's ok, that he's going to be responsible and calculated. \n\u25cf He goes out, started drinking. Getting drunk. (As he gets drunk he replies to me slower and slower. He forgets about his phone even when he's with me too in those situations, so I know it's that and nothing else) \n\u25cf Kinda late in the night I called him and he replied really angry saying that this is the first time in two months that he's out with his friends and I'm being extremely annoying. \n\u25cf He got home late. Stayed at a friend's apartment. Wakes up, we fight. We made up. Stays pretty much the entire day there, and then he says he's going home. \n\u25cf 5 minutes later he told me they stopped at a bar to get ONE beer and then they'll go. It's been three hours and idk how many beers, like 4 or 5. It's not about the drinks, it's about the time\n\nPlease, I think I'm really getting tired of his behaviour and it really breaks my heart thinking that I could lose him, but I can't to this shit anymore. I can't stand his habit of not having a limit on drinking when he's with he's friends. The distance doesn't help. His actions make me want to block him and never speak to him again. \n\nBut when he's not with his friends, he's a wonderful guy that quit smoking, heavy drinking and going out for me. He quit going to casinos and stuff, also for me. \nPlease, if anyone can talk to me... I'm in desperate need of a friend right now.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678648395.0},{"title":"I (20M) am at a crossroads with my relationship with my gf (20F), any advice?","author":"Due-Employment697","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11pms5g\/i_20m_am_at_a_crossroads_with_my_relationship\/","text":"I have been in a relationship with my girlfriend for almost 4 years, we were high school sweethearts.

For Valentine's Day this year, he bought me a few things that I had mentioned in passing that I wanted - I was touched that he noticed the small details. I got him a hoodie and baseball cap with his favorite gaming character, which he hadn't mentioned wanting but which really reminded me of him and that I thought he would enjoy. I spent a lot of time picking them out too, so it wasn't for want of effort on my part. When I gave it to him, he got very frustrated, saying that he had repeated mentioned recently that he wanted a specific name-brand jacket (which I had noticed, but it was after I already bought his gift and it was a bit out of my price range) and thought his gift was going to be this jacket. He has been unhappy about inequalities in our relationship that he perceives (mostly that he drives more than I do to see me, but I currently don't have a vehicle because of various extenuating circumstances) and brought this up as an example of inequality - he notices the small things about me but I don't for him.\n\nI explained myself but he was still upset. I felt really bad about all this and ended up buying the jacket. He then perked up and revealed to me that he felt like he was being treated like a child when I gave him clothing with a cartoon character on it, but that he actually really liked the hoodie. He then proceeded to wear the hoodie out on errands.\n\nIt's been weeks and we've moved on, but this entire incident still sits with me the wrong way. I was told growing up that a gift is a gift - you can exchange the item if you don't like it, but you shouldn't be rude about it and you should still appreciate the heart from the gifter. What's really screwing with my mind right now is that he knew he liked the hoodie when he asked me for the jacket - it seems like he lied\/manipulated me to get the jacket for him as a sign that I was putting as much effort as he was into the relationship. It's just a jacket - not a big deal - but I can't get over that he might've used me to get what he wanted.

I have had issues finding a purpose (in both long and short term) to still keep up with life, and am in dire need of some advice (which, by the by, I have not been able to recieve in any sphere of life). This might turn out to be a long one, so heads up.\n\nI have had issues with BPD for quite a while now, and I have been struggling with maintaining and balancing relationships for a long time. My first girlfriend had a similar condition, which made the relationship one helluva ride; its conclusion better not mentioned. Shortly after the breakup, however, I was told that I might not actually have BPD at all. It was different with the three psychiatrists I have been to so far, and the state of my mental condition is still rather vague, although I reckon it is BPD given how similar the symptoms are. My second and current girlfriend have been dating for a year, and things have been weird for the most part of our relationship. I genuinely care for her, and even like her. I am unsure of whether or not I love her, snd if I want to stay with her.\nShe was being blackmailed by someone for around three years, and I was lucky to be a part of her journey out of that unfortunate sequence of events. If not for me, she might end up going down the wrong career path, and because I genuinely care for her I do not wosh to do that to her. I also reckon I harbor an asxual attitude, and sex does not excite me. Mastirbation, however, is preferred over sex, and that seems like cheating (if you know what I mean).over my girlfriend.\n\nI'd probably come off as someone really disillusioned, and so I am really hoping someone would want to spare a minute or two, to offer some advice they think might help me in this relationship (and in life in general). \n\nThank you for taking out the time.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678647366.0},{"title":"My bf(20M) is upset with me(20F) because I wanted to get ready before sex","author":"Fickle-Yesterday-108","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11pmi3o\/my_bf20m_is_upset_with_me20f_because_i_wanted_to\/","text":"My bf (20M) and I (20F) have been together over a year and are very sexually active. We planned on having sex last night. We were flirting with and teasing each other all day. Evening rolled around and we were playing online games with my family. We had microphones on so my family could hear us and we could communicate while we play with them. While we were playing with them, we were lightly teasing each other. He offered that I have sex with him while we play. I told him no, not while we play games. Obviously because they would hear us. He said ok and seemed fine with it and then we finally got off the game and decided to go to bed. By \"go to bed\" I mean get ready for bed, cuddle, have sex, and watch movies until we fall asleep. I got up and made our bed, got a drink, turned off our gaming consoles, changed clothes, and got condoms out. This only took me about 10 minutes. The whole time I was doing this, he was trying to initiate sex. I wanted sex, I just wanted to get everything done first. He took it the wrong way and thought that I no longer wanted sex. He layed down with his back to me and said that if I still wanted him, I could initiate. So I did, I started kissing him, running my hands all over him, doing all the little things that I know turn him on. I was getting zero reaction, he wasn't smiling or talking to me or interacting at all. I asked him if he was ok and he told me that he just wasn't in the mood anymore cause I had shut him down so many times. I told him I was sorry and I didn't mean to shut him down. I explained that I just needed a few minutes to get ready and that I still wanted him. He said that I obviously didn't cause I wasn't trying very hard to initiate. But I was doing what I always do to turn him on and it has proven very effective in the past. I asked him if there was anything specific or different he wanted. He just told me no and that it didn't matter anymore. So I stopped trying to initiate, rolled over and tried to go to sleep. After a few minutes he said out of no where \"Ok fine. Night.\" I asked him why he was upset when he just told me it didn't matter. Once again I tried to explain that I was just getting ready and that I was sorry that I gave him the wrong message. I also said that next time I would try to communicate better with him. He said he didn't care and went to sleep.

I'm passing a difficult situation that has last like two years and maybe finally it's coming to the end.\n\nMe (27M) and the other guy (20M) started a relationship many months ago, but due to other things we broke up even if we love each other.\n\nAs context, my ex-bf always liked to do role play on Twitter of histories, adventures and that kind of things and sometimes he did sex role play though DM. That made me feel so insecure so he stopped role playing anymore.\n\nIn the other part, I'm so hedonist so when I was single I made sexual encounters with another guys or have an OnlyFans account. Naturally all these things made him feel insecure.\n\nLast part of the context is that a few weeks ago when we broke up he meets a guy from another country that have lot of things in common with him, but everything was ok with that because it was a new friend and that's all. When we broke up, he told me that this guy helps him a lot when he was sad and now they are besties.\n\nAfter that we started a hard time as best friends where everything made us feel insecure, so in order to stop this kind of bad feelings we decided to make a \"pact\" where he could role play with another guys as he likes to do (not sex role play, but he was ok because he told me that he wasn't searching that sort of things) and I could continue my OnlyFans account, but dodging both any sexual encounter.\n\nThings started to be difficult when he negates to tell me the username of his role play account hiding that as \"his privacity\". As a fact, he already knows my username for sexual things, but he told that he was not interested on reading my tweets.\n\nAfter a few days of problems and lack of trust, he got angry and tell me which username is and what I found?\n\n- He told me he started with the account two days ago. He kept one entirely week role playing.\n- There were things that made me feel insecure, like his account was about BL RP (boys love role play) and he never tell in any part that he doesn't do sexual RP. All his tweets was histories of his character flirting other anime guys and specially one who looked like he was telling a love history between them. And surprise, the other guy was... His bestie, who usually makes BL role play with another guys and sexual role play.\n\nSooo finally his \"privacity\", was a hidden place when he made romantic role play with his best friend. After that we argued so much about that and he convinced me that there was not anything bad about it because he still loves me and well, a few days later and not related to this, we had more discussions and one night he told me he went to sleep I entered again on his role play account to find his account was partially dead... And he never role played with his friend again.\n\nWhat I found? Another surprise! He created three days ago a new role play account where he was role playing so much with his \"bestie\". He hide me that account after all what happened and he lied me being awaken although he said he was to sleep. Couldn't stand anymore and tried to write the another guy trying to understand what is happening and if he knows all our history, as there was things that made me doubt if he knew that my ex was still in love of me for example. He never opened me DM as he was warned by my ex that I wanted to talk with him first time I found out his BL role play account so I started to tweet tagging him tweets to tell him the history and letting him to know I was not looking for blame him. He phoned my ex while he was sleeping to tell him what was happening and then my ex and me never talked again ever.\n\nAs you can see I have been clear on everything we did. I know I can do bad things, but I need some advice to make me understand things. Could you stand that your boyfriend make romantic role play with another guy (his best friend) while he says \"it's not me! It's my character!\". I couldn't understand that kind of things and I don't know if I really should have stood that. Where are the limits of an infidelity? How can you treat me as a stalker while you are hidding secret accounts from me more that one time?\n\nI need some honest words because I feel so bad about thinking if I should have trust him and never find out that account... But what would I won? Months or years being cheated until he tells me and he makes me lose my time with him.\n\nTrust is a difficult thing, and this guy made me lose that so many times that I was trying to recover the trust on him as I always say that all the people learn from their mistakes. And if I really tried to stalked him and didn't found anything probably were me who felt bad and my trust on him would get better...

I\u2019ve never done this in the past. A couple of months ago he was acting different so I went through his phone and saw that he messaged an Indian girl and went to lunch with her and had some flirty texts. I sucked it up and didn\u2019t confront him at this point. Fast forward to last night. He claimed he was meeting up with his cousin last minute because he was in the area so it was convenient. His cousin lives in NJ and we live in NY. He texts me at 4am to tell me that he\u2019s staying over in NJ and will be home in the morning. I call him. He doesn\u2019t pick up immediately but calls back 2 minutes later. He comes home at 10am and I\u2019m pissed. I go to smell his coat and it smells like Indian food. I grew up around Indians so I know the smell. His cousin is Hispanic and the supposed house he stood in is of Hispanic ppl as well. Of course I confront him and he denies, agrees the coat smells funny but doesn\u2019t know why. I didn\u2019t tell him about the texts I read yet. I ask to see some proof like a text from his cousin when he said to pick him up and he refuses. Now he\u2019s mad at me for accusing him and calling him a liar and we\u2019re not talking. We\u2019re approaching 40 so it\u2019s really frustrating. Advice?\n\nUpdate: I admitted to going through his phone and seeing the messages. He said he knows who I\u2019m talking about and it\u2019s an old classmate of is (which I already knew) and they only went to lunch. And apologized for lying. He also showed me texts from his cousin which showed that he picked him up. Doesn\u2019t show me what else happened last night. He\u2019s pretty furious that I went through his phone and accused him of cheating last night.

I broke up with her after we had a pregnancy scare which was easily the most stressful time of my life which is saying a lot coming from me, I won\u2019t do a deep dive into the red flags but one of the things she said was that she thought my neice was ugly which kinda hurt I think she was just trying to gas light me as she probably knew that my niece meant the world to me. While breaking up with her was not easy it was what a lot of people felt I should do, I didn\u2019t do because I wanted to do but more because I felt like it was what I should be doing I guess that\u2019s my heart vs the logical part of me, this was back in November and honestly it\u2019s something I still regret to this day. \n\nWell fast forward a bit I also lost my business around the same time as I broke up with her and I hadn\u2019t accomplished some of the financial goals I had set out for myself (business had loads of very happy clients but I was working like a dog to make like 30k a year) this was all weighing pretty heavily on me so in December I decided that I wanted to sell my car I had had for the last 6 years and get something different as I had gotten board of what I had (I\u2019m a car guy the idea of switching cars made no sense but then again having a car also makes no sense lol) so I sold my car and bought a used Ford F-150 which I absolutely love I also decided after talking with my dad that I needed some time away so I took a 11,000 mile road trip from Toronto Canada down to Florida all over Florida to all the way over to the west coast to visit family and friends. It was a very expensive trip and although I enjoyed parts of it I\u2019m not sure I would do it again. What my mom and dad didn\u2019t know or anyone for that matter at the time of planing this trip was I was not sure if I would be coming back from this trip I saw San Francisco sort of as a possible final destination I wanted to kill my self there I felt as though life was not worth living and it was not panning out how I thought it might my business had failed I lived at home and I broke up with this amazing girl that I still missed in many ways I only bought that truck and did that trip because those where things I wanted to do before I die. \n\nFast forward to now here we are in March I just got home after 57 days away I\u2019m not sure I feel a whole lot better about where I am in life and I still miss that girl. I did confess to my mom that I had considered killing myself and I did hint at it to my best friend since I was 8. They were both quite concerned. \n\nAs I\u2019m writing this I don\u2019t think I have the fire power to kill myself at the moment and I\u2019m not sure I could leave my family with that mess as well as I would like to see my sister get married this summer but what I am considering at this moment is going back to my ex and explaining to her just how much it broke me to brake up with her and that I loved her maybe bring her flowers and give her a hug one last time for closure. I would like to get back with her but my fear is the rejection that could come with purposing that idea I\u2019m not sure I could handle that right now. I\u2019m not sure what this post is meant to be but I\u2019m putting this out there in hopes that someone can read this and maybe offer some advice thanks\u2026\u2026March 12 2023 2:18","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678645691.0},{"title":"My gf [22F] and I [23M] are going through some teething issues and idk how to approach it.","author":"greasy_calzone","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11pg2ea\/my_gf_22f_and_i_23m_are_going_through_some\/","text":"I leave on the east coast of England, about 3 hours from London, and she lives in Birmingham.She graduated in marketing last year and I\u2019m due to graduate in industrial economics this summer. We had both agreed that upon graduating we would look for jobs in London as we had planned to live there together in our 20\u2019s. I will be looking for a job in finance, whereas she has found a job in marketing for a large brand where she gets to work between Birmingham and London with a split of about 50 50. This means she is living from home in Birmingham.\n\nWe have been doing long distance since she graduated, and it\u2019s fine, I\u2019d be more than happy to continue it short term, furthermore, if I lived and worked in London, with her current job she could easily be over at least once a week.\n\nThe issues arise when we start considering life beyond our 30\u2019s. She changed her mind about living in London because she wants to start saving for a house now and wants to buy one with me in her hometown by the time she is 27\/28. Whereas I want to live in London until 30-35 as I want to advance my finance career as much as possible and be around my extended family who are all based ther. I compromised by agreeing to move to Birmingham at 33ish to settle, but this isn\u2019t enough for her. She has an idea of what she wants to have completed by what age and sees no other viable options. I asked if she would rather break up and she said absolutely not.\n\nWhat\u2019s more is she wants to be a stay at home mum for the first 4-8 years of our children\u2019s lives. She thinks London will be too expensive to buy a house and also to live in with one salary. But, I don\u2019t really want her to stay at home and I\u2019m also not fussed about having the nicest home as long as we are together. (I can expect \u00a360k plus in London hood qualifying)\n\nThis whole thing stinks and I don\u2019t know how to have a conversation about it (this is my first serious relationship).

I\u2019m on the verge of ending my 6 year long relationship with my partner but I\u2019m so conflicted because I\u2019m scared I\u2019m making a mistake because somewhere in the back of my head I think he\u2019ll change. I\u2019m unhappy and don\u2019t like being tied up with this person who has no regard whatsoever of my feelings or even existence in his life. I strongly feel he just wants company. I would really like to work on our relationship but I\u2019ve lost all hopes and don\u2019t know what to do. I have been going through this for years now so it\u2019s a long read, I\u2019m sorry. \n\nNo communication, he does not talk, completely shuts me off if I do. We\u2019re always watching something on the tv when spending time together. Avoids resolving conflicts, every time we have an argument he tells me to stop talking about it and says I\u2019m nagging and doesn\u2019t like my voice. Well its obviously going to feel like nagging when I\u2019m the only one talking and he says nothing and that annoys me and makes it sound like a nag! Makes me feel that I\u2019m crazy to even have a problem when we\u2019re talking about issues and then makes me feel like I\u2019m always making a big deal. \n\n\nHe is selfish with things he owns and plans he makes. Plans only for himself (never includes me) an example: I have been asking him for the past 3 years to join the gym with me just because we\u2019ve both been wanting to lose some weight and get healthy again and he\u2019s always denied but after 3 years just 3 months ago when his friends decide to, he very willingly decides to join with them and conveniently tells me I\u2019ll be going to the gym with so and so. Without any hesitation. Even though he hasn\u2019t gone up till now because he\u2019s extremely lazy but this decision upset me very much because I have been trying to go together for years. \n\nOnly looks for pleasuring himself during sex (no kisses, no intimacy, no foreplay, not much eye contact) he always wants to have a quickie and I\u2019ve spoken about how I\u2019d like us to have longer sex, like some foreplay or kissing but he always tells me he\u2019s tired or next time. I love pleasing him and I do things that I know please him but never receive it in return. I don\u2019t like having sex with him anymore. \n\nMakes me feel unattractive, he\u2019s never complementing me or sharing views on anything I do or wear differently. \n\nUses me for his advantage, I have asked him multiple times to get his drivers license but he keeps delaying it even though HE WORKS AT THE PLACE THAT ISSUES DRIVERS LICENSE. He can apply any day. He keeps asking me actually expecting me to drive him when HE THINKS I have free time. There\u2019s many more instances like this. \n\nNo plans for the future, Says we\u2019re too young to do grown up things like making plans about where we want our relationship going, career paths, investing into a house together I understand if not it\u2019s not now but in the coming years. But doesn\u2019t even want to do things like go for dinners, parties, bar, watch a movie, just for a walk in the park, eat ice cream, winter\/summer activities, bowling, golfing etc.. He even refuses to go out on dinners with my family. I keep using the excuse that he\u2019s an introvert who enjoys staying home and that we enjoy watching movies together as a way to spend time together I\u2019ve said this to others and to myself to the point that I started believing it but honestly I resent it. I hate that we\u2019re always at home and that he doesn\u2019t want to go out, even going to watch a movie is a struggle that I\u2019ve started to think of ways I can trick him into going out with me by pre-purchasing tickets so he can\u2019t back out last minute and I feel so heart broken doing this because I never want to have to trick him to do something. I know he\u2019s not an introvert because he very much enjoys going out with his friends whenever they make a plan even if that\u2019s 8pm on a work night. It\u2019s not often but that\u2019s definitely because his friends have a life but I\u2019m certain if they planned frequently, he\u2019d be going. When it\u2019s with me, he\u2019s always tired, has a headache or some other bs excuse to not do anything. If I had a dollar for the amount of times he\u2019s used a headache as an excuse to not do something I\u2019d be able to pay off my student loan. \n\nThere\u2019s things like he\u2019s messy, lazy, inconsiderate, unorganized, self centred and so on but those really aren\u2019t reasons for me to finish things off. I feel realization for these little things come to people with responsibility and time. But the bigger things that really upset me have been bothering me for a very long time now and it only gets worse. I think I don\u2019t want to continue this relationship anymore but I truly love this man and I\u2019d do anything for him to finally realize and try to change. My mother did and is still doing the same and I don\u2019t want that repeating honestly I\u2019m just looking for some advice because I\u2019m not sure what I should do anymore. \n\nThanks so much for helping me out!

She would have moments of insecurity before then but I\u2019ve reassured her every-time and i thought things were okay until around mid January 2023. My girlfriend told me that she has these critical voices that will tell her all of these horrid things in her mind like; she\u2019s not good enough for me, she\u2019s not pretty enough, her boobs are too small, she\u2019s letting me down, she\u2019s holding me back from better experiences and a lot more.

I feel like I\u2019m stuck in a constant loop of not being able to help and this is making me question my self worth as I should be able to help her and make her feel good about her self but nothing I do works. She has this constant desire to be good enough and I\u2019ve told her so many times that she is good enough, all of the ways she is good enough but that is never enough.\n\nI\u2019ve been feeling this overwhelming guilt over everything because she says she does all of the worrying, overthinking and as she says it \u201ctrying to be good enough for me\u201d with all of this weight of it all being for me I just feel so guilty as if she wasn\u2019t with me she wouldn\u2019t feel all of these negative things.

She will physically be in pain because of how much she is shaking and crying because of it all, she\u2019s said that the world will be better without her and I hate seeing her like that but nothing I do makes it stop. So here comes the guilt again about if I wasn\u2019t in her life then she wouldn\u2019t have this problem or at least not as severe and will alleviate the stress for her, it\u2019ll hurt tremendously for me but I care more about her well being than I do about my own. \n\nWe\u2019ve had many discussions about this and I know she\u2019s been emotionally abused by her ex in the past so that\u2019s why I\u2019ve treated her to the absolute best a human being can be treated in my eyes, I\u2019ve told myself I can fix her and turn everything around for her but I\u2019ve also been told I\u2019m not a therapist by her and others and that she\u2019s too far gone. My friend gave me an analogy of, I\u2019m stood at the opening of a very dark tunnel with 0 light at the end and my girlfriend is walking into this tunnel and I\u2019m trying to chase her into this tunnel and bring her out of it but she\u2019s so far deep into the tunnel that once I\u2019m in there with her I can\u2019t see the light behind me anymore so I will be lost in the tunnel to with her. That\u2019s really stuck with me.\n\nI\u2019m really conflicted on what to do as I want to be with her for aslong as I can but I want what\u2019s best for her and what inevitably will be what\u2019s best for me.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated, I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m an asshole for bringing this to Reddit and I\u2019m sorry if anything I\u2019ve done is wrong I\u2019ve never intentionally done anything that could hurt anyone and would never do anything to hurt her, I love her too much to see her in pain. \n\nThank you for reading.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678630790.0},{"title":"(27F)(28M) my boyfriend talks to girls he used to hook up with, and considers them friends","author":"snelly1840","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11pl7j0\/27f28m_my_boyfriend_talks_to_girls_he_used_to\/","text":"My boyfriend (28) and I (27) have been dating for 5 months. He was open with me that some of his friends are girls that he used to hook up with, but assured me that there was nothing there with them and I shouldn\u2019t worry. There\u2019s also a girl that he consistently DMs memes to on Instagram, and when I asked who she was, he said it was his old roommate\u2019s best friend who he also became close with. He told me about her and I made a joke saying that she sounded exactly like his type. His response was \u201cyeah we\u2019re pretty close.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve been betrayed in the past so I\u2019m always on high alert, but should I be worried about these things? I want to trust him when he says there\u2019s nothing I should worry about and that I\u2019m the one he wants to be with.

He was my childhood crush in middle school, but of course had no idea who I was. I was a shy girl that stayed in my lane and was pretty much mute. We matched on tinder and started talking and seeing each other almost everyday. We haven\u2019t made anything official but he\u2019s thrown around the word LOVE. I do have love for him but I\u2019m very frustrated with him. We haven\u2019t had sex, he\u2019s told me that he\u2019s worried that our relationship will only be about sex since he\u2019s had past relationships like that. Also worried about post \ud83c\udf30 clarity but he now says he\u2019s not worried about that since he has strong feelings for me. I\u2019ve been patient with him about it but recently I\u2019m getting very sexually frustrated. Specially since he likes to get me very turned on and leave me with woman blue balls. Recently I was on my \ud83e\ude78and that first day I got it he said he was going to fuck me but then couldn\u2019t. I said soon as I get off of it he needs to. Well I got off of it and told him so, we joked about having sex and he then left me on delivered for 5 hours. That day we were also suppose to go to the drive ins that he mentioned he would take me a week prior. I did not remind him because I want to be prioritized without needing to remind a man. I knew already that he forgot because it\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s done this. I took a nap instead and seen that he texted me apologizing for not texting since he was playing games with his homies and time slipped. I don\u2019t care about that, glad he has fun with games since I do the same. Just upsetting, I mentioned that he forgot and he was very sorry about it. I hate being told sorry, I want action. I also thought he would jump at the idea of me being off my period and give me what I\u2019ve been craving. He did not then, and today again nothing. We are very open about everything and anything together, he\u2019s mentioned past flings and hook ups and one night stands. It\u2019s frustrating to hear that he can have sex with strangers no problem but won\u2019t do anything with me. I don\u2019t care that he has experience, I just care that I\u2019m not getting what he knows I want. I\u2019m a very sexual person and I need that connection to be fully into the relationship. I\u2019m tired of waiting but also tired of him not fully listening to what I want. I really like him but the situation with him makes me want to cry and scream. What should I do?","upvote_ratio":0.44,"created_utc":1678644218.0},{"title":"I\u2019m (22F) really worried that my bf (23M) may have drugged me, idk if I\u2019m just being crazy","author":"ThrowRA384748493","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/11l42vx\/im_22f_really_worried_that_my_bf_23m_may_have\/","text":"I slept at his apartment and he was at work and I needed Tylenol in the morning and checked his drawers for some and I found a small baggie I suppose.

I don\u2019t do drugs so I\u2019m not sure what that does but Google said it makes you sleepy. There were two strange incidents when I was at his place and randomly fell asleep.

Up until around 6 months ago, I thought our relationship was good. We've had our ups and downs, and covid really tested us, but I thought we had got through it.\n\n6 months ago my wife started acting different to her usual self. At first I thought she was just in a rough spot, but then I started seeing red flags about her cheating. The usual changes in dress, behaviour towards certain people, more focus on makeup and the like. Having been cheated on before, this triggered things in me.\n\nI raised them with her, and and she assured me she loves me. I asked if she was cheating, and named someone I'd seen her get quite close to recently. I got a qualified response, that she is definitely not interested in a relationship with that person. She didn\u2019t say that she\u2019s not interested in them, just that she\u2019s not interested in a *relationship* with them.\n\nExcept, I know that she was cheating on me. She confided in someone who isn't terribly good at keeping secrets.\n\nThen I noticed her checking her email one night, turns out she also has an account on hinge with her old surname. And she's been on it over a year. I now don't know if she's ever been faithful.\n\nShe's crossed red lines and continues to go to sleep each night knowing that our commitment to each other is a lie.\n\nBut I still love her. I want to grow old with her. But I want and need to stop loving her so I can get the courage to tell her to leave and get a divorce so I can move on with my life. Then maybe one day I can find someone who cares enough about me so that we can share a life wholly together, rather than living a lie.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1677174294.0}]
