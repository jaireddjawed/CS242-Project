You guys are great!\n\nI was doing the EQ as part of the pre-workup for a diagnostic assessment (I am currently tentatively self-diagnosed) and I scored fairly highly at 50, so close to the average score of NT women. I'm curious to hear if anyone else has scored similarly, particularly as I'm aware that the traditional EQ is more a measure of allistic social skills rather than affective empathy itself, and hence something that autistic folks tend to score lower in. However, social difficulties have always been a core part of my life, and continue to affect me in a multitude of ways; in many contexts, social interactions don't come naturally at all. My own thinking about this score is that it might be partially a result of a lifetime of observing and learning from people, combined with an intuitive ability to pick up on others' emotions/vibes and the characteristics of my own mask (being quiet, kind, and supportive at all costs). Alternatively, maybe I just have more NT social wiring than I thought.\n\nI realise that every self-assessment tool is just that - a tool - and therefore has its limitations (particularly the EQ, which seems flawed in many ways). But if anyone has any thoughts or similar experiences, I would love to hear them!",

        "text": "Hello! I’m currently part way through my official diagnosis journey and am trying to work out what is relevant to share or not in my assessment. For context, I have a lot of symptoms of both dyspraxia and alexithymia but I think they may not be affecting me enough to be diagnosed, but I will leave that to a professional to decide.\n\nWhat I want to describe is the inability to notice my own body’s signals for things like hunger, thirst, temperature, needing to go to the toilet, etc, until my body decides it needs it now. This isn’t a case of I don’t notice. I literally cannot tell if I’m hungry or not until my stomach feels like it’s digesting itself and I’m about to pass out. I can’t tell I need to go to the toilet until I’m busting to go. I can sit with things like meditation where I’m focusing on feeling how my body feels and just get nothing back (except sensory things like my clothes or a breeze). It affects my pain tolerance too where I won’t feel anything until suddenly it hurts too much. I’ve had physios think I’m crazy when I’ve turned up with muscles that can’t move but they don’t hurt me at all. I don’t know if it is the signals not firing until late or if my brain just completely ignores them until it’s top priority, but I was wondering if anyone else felt similar given it sounds like it’s along a similar vein to alexithymia and dyspraxia where the brain’s signals aren’t working correctly. I’ve learned to cope with it by just building things like toilet breaks and food into my routines, which I do whether I feel like I need them or not. Is this potentially autism (or ADHD) related?",

Stay safe and good luck finding answers! \n\nA good rule of thumb for deciding whether or not something is ASD or another disorder like BPD is past history. In order to get diagnosed with autism, you had to have shown signs in early childhood. For something like BPD, or can only be diagnosed as an adult. \n\nRemember, puberty can look like BPD, and BPD can look like autism.

Emotions of gratitude and connectedness that stem from finally knowing that my way of existing is...valid. Shared. Fantastic.\n\nAnd now I'm overwhelmed with angry emotions about people who think they can hop on this forum and start making people feel like they don't deserve to pursue an Autism diagnosis.\n\nI've been diagnosed for two years. I still can't get over the things I used to believe/feel about myself. Before I knew. I hated myself so much, and in secret. I thought it was my own fault. I was pretending and trying to be the \"correct\" friend/partner/daughter. I didn't even know how to defend myself against ableist interpersonal expectations because I DID NOT EVEN KNOW THOSE WERE A THING. \n\nI did not appear disabled to people who did not see me sobbing in bathroom stalls, or compulsively picking my skin until my nerves were deadened, or going through failed relationship after failed relationship, or attracting abusers like flies, or accumulating crushing debt while being financially exploited in non-profit positions where I pushed myself to burnout to move mountains for the \"cause\", or using alcohol to excess in literally ANY social situation I could, or being interpersonally exploited in non-reciprocal friendships, or being denied the emotional support of childhood because I was viewed as a \"small adult\".\n\nOTOH, I didn't appear disabled to the people who saw me doing those things a lot, either, because they didn't want to see me that way. This includes my parents. That would have been INCONVENIENT for them. They gaslight me every time I try to confront them, about how they missed me spinning in circles alone in the corner at recess, or having OCD so bad I washed my hands until they bled. The only thing they \\*couldn't\\* ignore was how hard of a time I had being accepted by the other kids -- and their solution was often to find fault with me.\n\nAll this to say, there are ENOUGH barriers to people understanding their neurotype, and I personally feel that if somebody does the research, and has overcome ableist societal narratives enough to feel \\*excited\\* and \\*relieved\\* about the prospect of being Autistic? THAT is a huge tell and we should not be discouraging that in any form or saying shit like \"you can't just decide to be Autistic\" because...tbh...IME...allistic people usually DO NOT WANT TO BE AUTISTIC! They usually are not overwhelmed with relief at the prospect!   \n\n\nMost of the gatekeepy nonsense I see comes from a very cynical view of human beings, and also kind of a disconnect about the reality of what you \\*get\\* with an Autism diagnosis as a high-masking person. Like, here in the U.S., you can't bill for psychotherapy using ASD. Oh no. The only therapy that being Autistic will get you reimbursed by insurance for is the abusive behavioral variety. The academic and workplace accommodations I've gotten so far? Still had to go through a whole shitty rigamaroll for every single one of them. Also an ASD diagnosis on your medical record can get your kids taken away. Like somebody please tell me where the draw is for people to pretend to themselves that they're Autistic?\n\nI was telling my partner (and don't get me wrong, this is absolutely worth it!!) that truly the only tangible benefit is that it's allowed me to \\*start\\* feeling like a human, it's allowed me to \\*head down the road of stopping hating myself\\*. That's it. My diagnosis gave me an explanation and a community and a starting point for being okay with myself.\n\nAnd like. WHY isn't that enough? If being Autistic gives somebody the ability to see themselves in a HUMANE CONTEXT for the first time ever...like to me that's a huge indicator that the shoe fits, but even if it doesn't, why would you wanna deny somebody that?\n\nLike nobody's wrong that resources to support Autistic folks are thin on the ground, nor are they wrong that we need to center people with the highest support needs! However, those aims are not accomplished by limiting our numbers?!? Societal ableism is the enemy -- not our undiagnosed kin who are trying so hard to find us.  \n\n\nThat's just what I keep thinking about. Undiagnosed Autistics running around in pain and confusion and trying to find their Answer. I want them to get beacons of light and calls to come home from their community. I don't want them to see a message that makes them afraid they don't deserve to see themselves in a humane context.",

        "text": "Hiya!\n\nThis is probably a fool's errand, but I'm trying to clarify in my mind which types of politeness I can (and therefore should) consciously learn, and which I inherently just can't do (and therefore shouldn't attempt because it's just an exercise in frustration).\n\nI don't want to use autism as an excuse to be impolite.  I also don't want to metaphorically bang my head against a brick wall attempting something impossible for me.  So I'm trying to separate out which forms of politeness are and aren't possible to consciously learn.\n\nAs ridiculous as this sounds, I only recently learned that people have emotions pretty much all the time, as I hardly ever feel them.  This explains why I'm so \"patient\" and \"thick skinned\" (probably my unconscious is getting way more \"hurt\" than my conscious is).  But it also means that relative to me (or at least relative to my consciousness in particular), everyone else is really vulnerable, so I'll need to take care to work out what's upsetting to say, and not say it.  Ideally, I should even learn what makes people feel good to hear, and as much as I can without lying, say those kinds of things occasionally.\n\nHonesty: While I'm not comfortable telling even white lies, I hope I at least know when to keep quiet, though it's hard to be sure.\n\nInsults and compliments: I'm pretty sure I don't ever give either of these on purpose... though I do occasionally make neutral observations while forgetting to intonate my voice, and I should probably stop that, as I gather people think I'm complaining all the time.\n\nHints: I'm pretty sure I won't ever be able to encode and decode [implicatures](http://notebook.zoeblade.com/Implicature.html) (basically hints), and I *believe* it's a reasonable accommodation request to ask allistic people to try not to use hints on me, and not expect me to use hints with them, because I literally don't know how to... but I'm not *entirely* sure.  I can at least try to get better at noticing when someone says something unexpected, and trying to work out if that might be a hint, and if so, what they might be hinting at.\n\nI guess part of the problem is I keep seeing people here say that you can improve at these things with practice, but I don't regularly talk to any allistic people.  I guess that's a me-problem, but I don't want to start spending time going out of my way to try to practice something I'm neurologically incapable of performing in realtime, because it can only be performed unconsciously.\n\nBasically I see a big rift here between people (often early-diagnosed white men) who were given more leeway not to mask or be polite, which is great for their own mental health but less good for the people they're socialising with, and people (often late-diagnosed women and people in visible minorities) who managed to learn to mask and be polite very well, which was great for the people they're socialising with but less good for their own mental health.\n\nIs it possible to separate the burden of masking from the necessary mental labour of still being nice to people?  I ideally want to avoid burnout while simultaneously not hurting other people's feelings.  I really hope this isn't a zero-sum game, or at the very least that there's a good middle ground where everyone's reasonably happy and healthy.\n\nI'd love to hear anyone's thoughts on the matter.",

        "text": "Sorry if y'all get a ton of posts like this, but I recently figured out I might be autistic, or at least, I have a lot in common with the autistic people I know and share similar struggles. The way I figured this out was that basically ever since I became an adult and started working, I've had periods of intense burnout that get worse over time. The only thing that helps is to vastly cut back on the situations where I feel like I'm putting on a social performance and I've gotten pretty creative over the years figuring out ways to do that without tripping other people's alarms. \n\nMost recently, after 2 years of working full-time customer service and taking classes (staying with relatives to save up), I took a 6-month break from work and got an apartment alone, and then just took 2 classes at a time to make it look like I was staying busy. Then last month, over the holidays, I stayed with family and basically did nothing but lying around, eating, going on walks, reading, and crocheting in the same room as other people. I didn't make myself socialize in ways that felt fake, but I did go see a close friend one time. I think my family was worried, but honestly? I left those weeks feeling more rested than I have in years. \n\nThe problem is that now I'm lonely and bored. I'm feeling more ready to handle my life again, but every time I try to go to a social activity or date or push myself to keep a schedule, I inevitably backslide into a day of complete inability to make plans or accomplish goals. If I push myself really hard, I can sometimes do something useful on those days. But how do I know when pushing myself is just going to make things worse, versus when it will help? How do I know what discomfort at work is going to broaden my comfort zone and what's going to send me right back to quitting out of exhaustion? Anyone learned to balance this? I'm struggling to decide what life changes I need to make to accommodate myself as much as I can, and it would help if I knew what a recovery process feels like.",

        "text": "Body lotion feels so icky to me. I can tolerate it better if it’s just on one area (just my hands or just my legs, oc assuming it’s a texture/consistency/scent I can tolerate), but putting it over my entire body is a very icky experience to me. I used to just rarely apply lotion all over my body, but recently moved to a colder climate, and I think it’s a necessity unless I want to itch all winter. \n\nPossible mitigating steps I do/could take:\n\n1. Make sure it’s a tolerable texture/consistency/scent (I already do this)\n\n2. Split it up into multiple applications a day so I’m not doing my entire body at once, but I also have adhd and honestly just remembering to do it once a day is hard enough.\n\n3. Apply while still wet in the shower, which I’ve done before and is slightly more tolerable bc I immediately remove the excess when I dry off. \n\n4. I use moisturize soup, but it’s just not enough in the winter.\n\n5. I drink tons of water.\n\nAny other suggestions to mitigate the ick or ways to keep my skin hydrated without lotion? Or oil, oil is even worse.",

        "text": "I’ve only worked a few handful of jobs in my lifetime. Im quite inexperienced if I’m being honest. (Cashier jobs + customer/food service jobs are all I know) I’m up to learning new skills however, only if I feel I’m capable enough to accomplish the actual skill! (I don’t have a lot of confidence) so yeah, never been one to hold a job for longer than 2 years due to crippling mental health issues that I’ve been actively combatting for years, or I lost interest in said job and felt I could find a better opportunity elsewhere, so I’d send out a notice. (Every time I gave a notice I felt abnormally guilty like why? lol) so I’ve had luck landing jobs but however, \nI’ve also lost job opportunities as well but I’ve never been physically “fired” due to bad work behavior or anything of that matter, but more so lost the opportunity before it could even start when applying for jobs/landing the interview- one interview I tanked several years ago had me beating myself up for months and I thought I was never gonna prosper and have successful interviews ever again, felt very intimidated and thought something was wrong with me. It was the very first interview I got rejected. (I had successfully completed 2 interviews prior so I was confused) Luckily, I had a close friend who’s mother worked at the same establishment and I was nosey, I said to him: “hey! Can you ask your mom to ask the hiring manager why they didn’t call me back after my interview” — I was met with not-so-pleasing-to-hear feedback. I also just wanted to know what I did wrong so I could correct myself for next time. \n\nFor clarification: I remember almost exactly how the interview went down. I thought it started off well, &amp; I really thought I was just answering questions as honest and as transparent as possible. (*workplaces don’t like this I guess*) I was always told to “be confident” in my interviews, idk how to be but I know how to be honest &amp; literal. So I tried being “myself” instead of larping confidence. \n\nThe question that I think nipped me in the bud was “can you count the money in the drawer?”\n\nTo which my reply was- “if I had a better “”re-training”” of the process I’m sure I could master counting the drawer, I wasn’t strong with counting the drawer at my prev job due to discrepancies of training methods, I didn’t feel I was properly taught enough and would need a refresher essentially” to summarize the best way I can. \n\nI guess I could sense a little bit of tension coming from the interviewer after I had said what I said and I just didn’t understand what I said exactly that was deemed so negative? Only thing I thought negative was my inability to count a drawer confidently so I stated my reasonings why and how I can improve? \n\n*My close friend told me the establishment basically thought I was bad mouthing another establishment so that is why they rejected me* immediately riddled with more guilt because now I realize I made a shit first impression out of myself when that was never the goal or motive! Can anyone relate? Was I coming off as “rude?” \n\nNow I look at interviews completely differently— “tell them what you think *they want to hear*” which I think is basically manipulating and lying to a degree imo lol I don’t want to “sugarcoat” and “downplay” my strengths/weaknesses just to hopefully get hired. I hate the fake it til you make it mentality so much.",

I’ve also been talking about it with some of my family members. My mom and I have always had a bit of a disconnect that I never understood as a kid. It’s got better in recent years, but it’s still anxiety provoking and tiring to be around her because I feel I have to constantly monitor myself to make sure she doesn’t get the wrong idea. As a kid, she told me often that I acted as if I hated her and didn’t care about her. I would get very defensive about this because that didn’t at all line up with my perspective and she would refuse to explain what specifically I did to make her feel that way. I felt as if I could never explain myself in a way that she understood, and I didn’t usually understand her either. It was incredibly frustrating and upsetting. I internalized a lot of harmful rhetoric that wasn’t at all true, I thought something was deeply wrong with me, that I was broken, that I would never be able to make her understand and I would be doomed to get misjudged forever. Anyway, I’m writing this because my mom came into my room earlier and asked what I’d been doing, so I told her I’d been researching about Autism and we got to talking about that. She asked me why I thought I was Autistic (she thinks I might be as well) and I started to explain. I made the mistake of telling her about how I’d felt misjudged and misunderstood frequently as a kid, and belittled for not understanding without thinking all my sentences through more thoroughly before I said them. She got very defensive and we got into an argument, and I didn’t realize before it was too late that it WAS an argument and I couldn’t backtrack anything I’d said. She started to get extremely upset and I tried to explain but there was just such a disconnect between what I felt I was saying and what she thought I was saying. I wasn’t accusing her of anything or wanting her to explain herself or apologize.. I was just trying to tell her my childhood perspective. The fight is over and apologies have been made and all that but I had a bad emotional meltdown and I feel so insanely frustrated that I just can’t seem to explain anything in a way she understands. This type of thing has happened so many times throughout the years that I eventually just stopped trying to communicate my feelings to her at all. I have always been misunderstood. I have never been believed. I am SO TIRED of being misunderstood. My head hurts from hitting myself over and over in frustration. Why is there such a disconnect? Everything makes perfect sense in my head, but when I try to voice it, I just get told that it’s wrong.",

        "text": "I hear a lot about autistic people being \"childish\", \"bland\", or liking \"kid\" stuff as teens or adults. For example, an adult whose special interest is My Little Pony and mainly eats chicken nuggets would fall into this category. No shame towards them. I think it's pretty arbitrary what's considered \"immature\". My whole life, even within a few minutes of meeting people, I often get considered an \"old soul\" (but that sometimes changes once people think I have bad manners) or \"really smart\" and I'm not sure how I'm creating those initial impressions, to be honest.\n\nI have always had gotten in trouble for the opposite issue, especially as a kid. In elementary school, I got books confiscated and wasn't at all friendly with the school librarian because I only wanted to read stuff that was \"too mature\", that \"only the parents should read\". At that time, I was really interested in gross medical stuff, especially reproduction, obscure diseases, and chemicals that make up drugs. I was also nearly placed into foster care due to writing about those themes in creative writing. I got in trouble in art class for drawing hyperrealistic nude anatomy and blood. School staff would tell me I \"wasn't acting age-appropriate\".\n\nIn middle and high school, I got more interested in math and politics. According to both the kids and adults who bullied me, that was a problem too since I ended up learning calculus in middle school. I actually got my math teacher in trouble because he agreed to help me learn stuff I was interested if I showed up early and one of the school directors caught him teaching me differential geometry instead of state test material. When it came to politics, kids especially didn't like that I knew the ins and outs of local election candidates in middle school. I preferred listen to really obscure, academic contemporary classical music instead of \"appropriate\" music like Justin Bieber and One Direction.\n\nThe flak didn't stop once I got older. In college, professors didn't like that I already had my own research ideas and wanted to join labs that were \"for graduate students\", so I really struggled getting research experience that would actually make me competitive for graduate school. I still got told that I had \"old\" music tastes. I hated stereotypical college parties and preferred the parties professors threw for their students that only nerdy grad students showed up to (except for me), which had real food, a reasonable noise level, and decent alcohol.\n\nThese days, people think I'm a bit overly idealistic about my career aspirations. I need to \"stop thinking about what the 1% do for a living\". My top choice grad schools are \"swinging for the fences\". My local autism services, especially Vocational Rehab, are rather fed up with my white collar niche interdisciplinary interests and just wish I would just go work at Walmart as a cashier or greeter. I still have \"old people\" music tastes. I have also been told that my cooking is usually \"gourmet\" (sorry, I just think I can often make stuff from scratch better than the store-bought versions, especially when it just takes a few ingredients).",

        "text": "hello! ever since my younger brother of 21 got diagnosed i've been wondering if i am on the spectrum. i have previously been in therapy for social anxiety/avoidant personality. \n\none thing (not the only thing) that makes me wonder is that i am unable to deal with group settings. i often just feel like i wish i could leave. in a group of over 2 people i almost never speak because i don't know when it's my turn to speak. and even if i want to say something i just can't seem to get in between. furthermore, when there are multiple conversations going on i can only listen and watch, i just feel like i don't have the mental capacity to think original thoughts. i feel like i kind of \"zone out\" while still being able to listen but not speak. that leads me to my question. \n\nwhen in a group setting, especially when there are other conversations happening in the background, someone asks me something, i just feel like my brain is mush and it's very hard to focus on the conversation. even if i like the person, i just want the conversation to be over asap because it's so draining. it's hard to focus and communicate an answer that's even slightly long/complex/nuanced, so i will sometimes even say an answer that's not true, if it's the \"easiest\" to think of. this makes me feel really bad, because i probably come across as cutting off the convo or not being interested in the other person as i also don't ask them anything back. could this be a trait of autism?\n\nall this is also really bothering my gf because she doesn't speak my native language and i promised her i would help her get involved in conversation on my family gatherings but it's proving impossible. i once tentatively breached the subject of autism but she immediately said she thinks i don't have it (she has a master's in psychology so she feels very confident). my psychologist who i saw for my gender dysphoria said she wouldn't even test me for autism because \"obviously\" i don't have it. however, my mom said she could see that maybe i have it, and told me that once when i was a child some other parent at my horseriding club asked my mom out of the blue if i have autism.\n\nTL;DR: is it a thing to, when someone asks you a question in a group setting, it's so hard to focus and communicate an answer that's even slightly long/complex/nuanced, that you just say an answer that's not true, bc it's the \"easiest\" to think of?",

        "text": "I keep wondering why I never seem to be able to answer people (especially my therapist recently) to the prompt of “describing myself” - anytime a situation has occurred and I’m briefed to “describe myself” it’s like I’m being surprised with a pop quiz I didn’t study for. I’ve always felt lost and uncertain of myself for as long as I could remember but thought I’d figure myself out someday. I’m 26 and it took me over a day to answer my therapist 3 “positive things” about myself. *for a homework assignment* (Severe depression &amp; anxiety riddle me greatly so that doesn’t make it easier) \n\nRecently I realized I tend to deal with sort of identity-crisis tendencies? *i think*? I constantly feel the need to change my physical appearance after I felt like I looked a certain way for *too long* or I’m bored and need a change (I have ADD and like to do impulsive things sometimes) I’ve dyed my hair a ton of different colors, bleached and shaved off my eyebrows, had a multitude of diff hairstyles + wardrobe style changes, music genre taste changes, hobby changes,etc etc to *see what sticks and what feels right, or what feels like me.* I still feel utterly lost. Unsure of myself. \n\nI also started looking back at “different versions” of myself based on who I was friends with (at the time) because I’ve also came to the realization that my “personality, outfit &amp; music influences, physical appearance, lifestyle habits, etc” essentially revolved around the people I would be really close with. I started talking like them, using their lingo and mannerisms. Listened to the music genres they listened to, even wanting to look like them (dress like them, style my hair like them, almost pretend to be them?) or be an extension of them while I also tried to find *some originality* within myself because when I was a teenager I got bullied a lot about “not having any originality” I was a “poser that copied so and so” — I thought it was normal in middle school to *follow the latest trends* like, for instance- B wore red skinny jeans to school so I wanted to wear red skinny jeans too, or S dyed her hair black so I wanted to dye my hair black too- but I guess that was a crime to want to partake in the same activities my peers were doing? I just wanted to be involved and included? *I just wanted to do what I deemed other cool people were doing so I could be deemed cool too?*\n\nAs I got older, I had a hard time sustaining friendships. Every best friend I had (I’ve only had a few *close bsfs* - making friends and keeping them is always hard for me) we fell off sadly. Purely from communication failure (mainly on my part because rejection fear, trust issues, feeling misunderstood, boundary issues, trauma) as soon as I lost these friends, I felt I lost myself at the same time. \nMonths and years go by and I still struggle with identifying myself most days after not having these ex-friends in my life anymore, I thought spending all this time in solitude and being content with being alone would\nhelp me “find myself” or learn more about who I really am inside - so I resort to impulsive physical altercations of my appearance to see if it feels like *me* genuinely. Or I’ve also been doing nostalgic things that I remembered once gave me peace and happiness when I was in my youth years. To just feel something. Anything. *Who is this person controlling this body on autopilot?* I just feel like I never got to truly understand/figure out who I really was as a person for my whole life because I spent too much time trying to appease myself to others for acceptance. Did it for so many years and now I feel like an empty blank piece of paper.",

I go nonverbal when upset or overwhelmed, and get overwhelmed easily by overstimulation. I do and have done my whole life what I now know is called stimming, although I made myself not do a lot of stims in front of people bc I learned early on they thought it was weird. I was never able to and still can’t understand things everyone else could or I needed it rephrased, I had and have trouble with social cues and “reading a room” and reading faces and understanding intentions and sarcasm. Eye contact for me is either none at all (and it’s uncomfortable for me to do if I try) or so much it makes them uncomfortable. Metaphors, analogies and similes have always been confusing (I’ve got to the point where I’ve memorized the common ones and what situations people use them in and usually just smile and nod). I also got to a point where I did what might be “masking” I kinda just copied what “normal” people did bc I had an understanding that I was not like them. I copied their cues and if in doubt just said I had to use the bathroom to get out of a conversation. I internalized a lot of self hate early on bc I didn’t understand why I couldn’t do, understand, or deal with the things everyone else could. Even my “awkward” or “shy” friends were nothing like this. Anyway I started researching autism in girls and it was eye opening. I checked almost ALL the boxes. I recently worked up the courage to ask my parents (I still live with them and am a dependent) if I can get screened and told them I might be autistic. I was really scared but they were cool with it thankfully:) anyway I’m really nervous now bc A) what if I don’t have it and we go to this trouble just to learn I WAS only struggling bc I’m stupid and incompetent. Or B) Even if I do where do I go from there? And what will happen during a screening? Can I trust they’ll be able to tell? Will they think I’m just seeking attention? Sorry this was a little rant but if you have anything to share with me (advice or otherwise) I’d really appreciate it. I’m really nervous about the whole thing.",

I was heavy bullied for being awkward, and people would try to be my friend just to make fun of me. My weight was a target too but apparently my lack of social skills made me the \"weird\" girl. As an adult I feel like I am still viewed that way. I only know how to talk to people when things are strictly physical but to have an actual conversation or hold onto a friendship, I just don't succeed. I'm aware that there are varying factors as to why, some of them my fault actually. Not knowing how to socialize is part of why I feel so lonely. I don't know how to not weird people out or to be so intense that I scare them away. I fear that I may have adult female autism that has gone undiagnosed because it is the only thing that explains why conflicts with other people happen a while after I let them into my life. The way that a connection changes is what stops me from trying to make friends again, at least until I get a diagnosis for autism. I don't pick up on jokes, I'm not aware of what's appropriate to say or not, I say very wild things bc it's just what comes out of my mouth and off the top of my head. The way I act is not socially example thus me having no social skills. I don't know, I just wanted to vent because I feel so alone and I'm bad at keeping company that is good for me",

        "text": "I posted in here not too long ago in regards to your guys’ feedback on various links to autism! I had previously mentioned dealing with food intake issues. (I’ve been this way *forever*) I was constantly deemed the “picky eater” or “being too needy and annoying” for my specific food preferences. I’ve got a list of specific foods I desperately avoid for many reasons: texture, taste, and smell mainly. I categorize foods that I’ve recognized my body to reject on site - basically *the second my brain can recognize these specific foods* - I start to gag and get sick feeling when I’m around these foods. \nOdor of foods is probably my biggest trigger— (eggs, seafood, dairy products like cottage cheese, cream cheese, yogurt, etc + some veggies like broccoli and cauliflower and mushroom— to say the least are my trigger foods that I refuse to consume) \ntaste goes hand in hand with this because sometimes my brain will think *some things taste the same way it smells* so I avoid food for that reason as well. (I think eggs &amp; sea food taste the way they smell and it repulses me greatly, my nose burns when I smell them and then I feel sickly) \nmy next bone to pick with food is the texture—I need consistency, i need sameness every time, I need to know there’s no food touching or cross-contaminating (example: lettuce used as garnish on chicken tenders makes me wanna explode) I don’t want soggy lettuce residue on my chicken strips pls!! 🥵 also, I need to thoroughly examine all my meals I get from takeout before I eat them *to make sure there’s no unwanted pieces of lettuce or anything else I didn’t ask for because I’ve bit into too many burgers and sandwiches to find unwanted visitors—lettuce or onion or tomato bits* I love certain veggies don’t get me wrong but ONLY by themselves or in a salad! Not mixed with meat or anything else! \n\nSo as you can see my dilemma: my taste pallet is pretty bland or limited. Ive been malnourished on/off due to this behavior I think - I do lose my appetite due to stress a lot as well, I’ve also got several comfort foods but I do have ADD so sometimes I *do get bored of eating the same 3-5 comfort meals* and need to spice things up and eat new things but *not too new* (I’ve tried to eat something new here and there buuut I’ve also ordered a back-up comfort meal just in case I didn’t like what I was trying) \n\nis this type of behavior a link to autism or can it be due to other things?",

        "text": "I’ve been seeing a lot of misinformation regarding the RAADS-R lately (not in this group thankfully), and I’m hoping by spreading this that people will be able to take what I say to help me stop the dispersion of harmful, misleading information.\n_________________________________\n\n[Ritvo et al. (2010)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3134766/) states that the RAADS is useful as an adjunct clinical diagnostic tool that must be completed in the presence of the clinician, and [Jones et al. (2021)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8452438/) states that the RAADS-R was not designed to be completed without face-to-face support. Any of these people taking the test from google or embrace autism as a self-report screening tool are [overextending the utility of the RAADS-R (and other tests)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26088060/), so therefore, their scores are null and should not be a primary factor that one considers when deciding whether or not to seek out a professional consultation regarding the possibility that they may have autism. \n\nFurthermore, there seems to be another problem of people not fully understanding the purpose of the test. It is not a psychometric to see ***how autistic*** someone is based off of how much further above the threshold they were able to score. Empirically, [results indicate no association between RAADS-R scores and clinical diagnostic outcome](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34552768/#:~:text=Results%20indicate%20no%20association%20between,to%20receive%20an%20ASD%20diagnosis), and the only thing that is even mildly deterministic of an autism diagnosis is whether they tested above the threshold of 65. In fact, [current literature](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?journal=International+Journal+of+Methods+in+Psychiatric+Research&amp;title=Testing+adults+by+questionnaire+for+social+and+communication+disorders,+including+autism+spectrum+disorders,+in+an+adult+mental+health+service+population&amp;author=T.+Brugha&amp;author=F.+Tyrer&amp;author=A.+Leaver&amp;volume=29&amp;issue=1&amp;publication_year=2020&amp;pages=p.+e1814&amp;doi=10.1002/mpr.1814&amp;#d=gs_qabs&amp;t=1673114728973&amp;u=%23p%3DnUNXW8YYVHQJ) suggests that the threshold should be increased to at least &gt;120, given that the average non-autistic score was around 124, resulting in an extremely high false-positive rate. \n\nHaving said that, it does not really matter because the reason the test was ever given any merit in the first place was because it was mainly designed to help elucidate someone’s thinking patterns in a way that a clinician is able to openly observe and interpret. The primary role of the clinician for the RAADS-R is to decide whether the patient’s answers and thought patterns align with a diagnosable presentation of autism- i.e. something like focusing on small, insignificant details when trying to answer a question could be more a clue that someone is on the spectrum than whatever their answer ended up being. The scoring of the question is also mostly for the clinician to decide and is not supremely dictated by the answer that was originally given. For example, if someone claims that they have always experienced sensory sensitivity but can only recall sporadic, nebulous instances with no reference to how it significantly impairs them in the major loci of their life on a continual basis, then their answer is not going indicative of autism. And contrary to what they might expect, they are not going to be assigned the total points they might expect from answering “true both now and when I was younger.” Instead, their answer will be given zero points because it doesn’t match the appropriate diagnostic criteria for what would be recognized as a symptom of ASD. \n\nElaborating further, a clinician knows that things such as sensory hypersensitivity, restricted interests, insistence on sameness, and stereotyped movements are part of the somewhat partially optional criteria B. So if a patient does not answer in a way that conveys that they experience ***all** (need 2/4) of these problems, it isn’t exactly going to “make or break” the diagnosis. They know to place more emphasis on social deficit areas rather than behavioral issues when coming to a diagnostic conclusion. But either way, what someone scores on the RAADS-R is given minimal consideration in terms of impact on final diagnosis. It is better to think of it as more of a tool to help clinicians observe someone without the patient’s knowing, and the score is just to provide empirical support to the diagnosis. The same thing applies to all “self-report” tests. \n\nAdditionally, if you did not already know, only childhood signs matter for what the test deems as *important enough* to warrant an actual diagnosis because, being that it is a developmental disorder, it is needs to have been present since early childhood (signs before three years old). Newly manifested symptoms are not taken into consideration as much, unless you have already established a strong foundation for prevalence in early childhood. This is done mainly to avoid misdiagnosis because many other disorders or problems can appear close to autism but are not, including things such as ADHD, OCD, CPTSD, Bipolar, or SzPD, etc., which multiple see onset for during early adulthood. \n\nFinally, to top off everything I have already stated, a good majority of people currently taking the RAADS-R test to go along with its recent popularity are adolescents, to whom the RAADS-R cannot be generalized. The mean age of participants in the RAADS-R validation study that solidified its practical reliability was around 33:\n\n&gt;The sample consisted of fifty adults, 70% of the sample identified as male (n = 35), 28% as female (n = 14), and 2% as transgender (n = 1), with a mean age of 32.8 years (SD± = 10.3). (Jones et al. 2021)\n\nThis should be getting talked about way more than it is because teenagers should not be taking this test, but I see nothing encouragement from adults, telling them to take invalid tests on embrace autism and to self-dx from little to no understanding on how certain symptoms they are experiencing could be normal; because, you know what else can look like surface-level signs of disorders like Bipolar, ADHD, BPD, Anxiety, or Autism? Puberty… \n\nPlease help me to squelch this rampant misinformation by spreading the truth. Thank you!",

        "text": "My hyperfixation is on the classical music piece, Hungarian Rhapsody 14 by Franz Liszt. It goes by many names: the piano solo version is called Hungarian Rhapsody 14 (S.244/14), the orchestra version is called Hungarian Rhapsody 1 (S.359/1), and the piano concerto version is called Hungarian Fantasy (S.123). The version I first listened to was the orchestra version, on January 2020. Halfway through the piece, I had an out-of-body experience. I had a vision of myself walking through the dim and dusty halls of an abandoned castle. The castle was in the middle of a forest that had a purple sky in perpetual sunset. My footsteps were in the beat of the music. The halls were dim, but it was lined with windows which let sunlight in. The sunlight illuminated the vast amount of dust in the dilapidated hallway. At the end of the hallway, there lies a throneroom. Its mossy stone floor was submerged with ankle-deep water. Parts of the roof were gone, exposing the purple sky. Stars are starting to appear; I must have strolled for a long time in the hallway. In the middle of the room, there were mossy columns in the ionic style. They vary in height because some of them have collapsed. And at the end of the room, there sits a white throne covered in moss. It is without anything soft or plush, the king must have been uncomfortable.\n\nThat vision of mine consumed me like how wildfire consumes the forest. It would reoccur throughout the day, no matter what I was doing. I would suddenly have the vision while I was washing dishes or talking to my mom, and the music was turned off during those occurrences! Yet, I loved strolling through the castle and examining the broken throneroom. It was cathartic, in a way. My favorite part of Hungarian Rhapsody 14 is the Allegretto alla Zingarese section, which is at 5:50 - 7:50 in the video. It translates to “In the Gypsy style”, hence I call it “the Gypsy part”. As you may have guessed it, the out-of-body experience happened at the Gypsy part. The tune is so captivating that it’s buried deep in my mind. I can recall the tune and hum it (though it is high-pitched so it’s difficult). I would have dreams where I listened to the Gypsy tune. \n\nI love Hungarian Rhapsody 14 so much that I listened to it every single day. I listened to it in a loud volume that it hurts my ears. I loved it so much I told my friends and family about it. But my friends were ambivalent. 1 of them said that the Gypsy tune is meaningless and laughed at me for researching it, so I dumped that friend. I couldn’t stop talking about it that one of my friends asked me if I’m Hungarian even though I obviously am not. I love Hungarian Rhapsody 14 so much that if a homeless person told me there’s an NFT of Hungarian Rhapsody 14 for sale at 1.3 million, I would drop all my stuff and buy it even though NFTs are a scam. I love it so much that if my house was soaked in petrol and burning down, I would run into it to save my 16 recordings of Hungarian Rhapsody 14. Yes, I have amassed 16 different recordings. I love it so much I want to marry it.\n\nHowever, Hungarian Rhapsody 14 is not famous. I couldn’t find a video that shows the whole orchestra playing it. The best I could find are videos where they play *segments* of the Rhapsody instead of the whole piece. For 3 years, I couldn’t find the sheet music for the orchestra version (S.359/1). I just discovered that it’s behind a paywall, and I would gladly pay for it! You may have heard of Hungarian Rhapsody 14’s sibling, Hungarian Rhapsody 2. Hungarian Rhapsody 2 was used in many cartoons like Tom and Jerry and Loony Toons. Animaniacs even had a song of Hungarian Rhapsody 2 called The Wishing Star. I would donate my kidney if it makes Hungarian Rhapsody 14 as famous as Hungarian Rhapsody 2. I would kill for a Hungarian Rhapsody 14 song! There is a youtube video that analyses Hungarian Rhapsody 2, but there is NOTHING for Hungarian Rhapsody 14! I would cut off my own finger if it means there will be a youtube video analysing Hungarian Rhapsody 14. \n\nSo I looked for dissertations analysing the Rhapsody. I found ONLY 1 in a book called Liszt’s Transcultural Modernism and the Hungarian-Gypsy Tradition by Dr Shay Loya. Well, I tried to read it, but the book blew me away. NONE of the sentences made sense. It felt like I was reading a foreign language. I asked the 50 year old principal at my high school to translate it for me, and even he doesn’t understand it because it’s PhD level literature! Instead of reading all the pages of the book, I read the pages where it talks about Hungarian Rhapsody 14. It analyses the Gypsy part in only ONE aspect! It does not even reveal the origins of the Gypsy tune. Liszt was not Romani, so how could he have composed the Gypsy part all by himself? Surely he has heard Gypsy bands playing a Gypsy song and used it as inspiration. I want to know so badly the inspiration and origins of the Gypsy part, yet I cannot. The book also does not analyse the orchestra version (S.359/1), it analyses only the piano solo version (S.244/1) 😭\n\nSo basically I am hyperfixating on a piece of music that NOBODY talks about. And not many orchestras play it. It’s so frustrating to be hyperfixating on something with not much content :/ I am madly in love with it that I have lost friends over it. I am madly in love with it that people question my ethnicity. I am madly in love with it that I’m afraid of dying, because I’ll be separated from my 16 recordings 😥 \n\nhttps://youtu.be/WLZiFNvewD4  Here’s a Youtube link to the video I listened to. I love Hungarian Rhapsody 14. The Gypsy part is at 5:50 to 7:50.",

        "text": "(Sorry if this isn't allowed and also sorry if this a bit rambly)\n\nBut I just wanna thank y'all. It's been over a year since I seriously started this journey of wondering if I was autistic and y'all have been such a big help. I know I've only posted and commented a few times here but even when I was just lurking and couldn't work up the courage to make a single post because I thought I'd be stepping into a space I didn't belong, the threads and discussions I read here helped so much - I know autism is a spectrum and no two autistic people are the same, but reading other's experiences and finding similarities and commonalities to my own made me feel better about myself.\n\nAnd it wasn't just here, of course! Reading other autistic experiences on social media, talking to my autistic friends about it, research and information I'd read from places like ASAN, the Autistic Women &amp; Nonbinary Network, and other organizations ran by and for autistic people (I knew ahead of time to avoid Autism Speaks, at the very least) was all so informative and helpful. I also knew that I had to crosscheck with other conditions because otherwise I'd feel I was falling into confirmation bias and I did do that, to the best of my ability.\n\nBut despite all of this, I still faced doubts and imposter syndrome. Even with all the evidence staring at me in the face, I basically kept telling myself 'I must be faking this, it's all fake' and that even if I think self-diagnosis is valid in others, it can't be valid for me because it has to be fake and I'll be exposed as a faker.\n\nI posted about these struggles here as my first post and one of y'all recommended the book Unmasking Autism (as well as another book I was unable to get ahold of) to me. Well I got the book from the library a couple weeks ago and I just finished reading it a couple days ago (started reading it on Tuesday, got about halfway through it and then finished it on Wednesday) but after finishing it, I needed some time to collect my thoughts on what I'd just read as well as what I wanted to say. But now that it's been a couple days, I can say this: I both was thoroughly engrossed by *and* hated what I'd read in Unmasking Autism.\n\nOr rather to be specific, I didn't *hate* Unmasking Autism as a book, I hated how much I related to some of the stories and experiences of both the author himself and the other autistic people he talks about and their stories. Two of the big ones that stuck out to me were the talking about being placed in the gifted program in school and how that means that we're expected to do great things because of our intelligence and also that any problems we may be facing get dismissed and overlooked because 'you're smart, you should be able to handle this' and the person's story talking about she (I believe the person the author was talking about in this story was a woman, apologies if I got them confused and they're another gender identity) could manage in elementary school because of the small class sizes but then started to suffer and have to mask once they got to middle school and now there were dozens of people they had to somehow know. And those are just the big ones, other stuff too like all the stuff about suppressing and hiding your interests to not be seen as 'weird' or 'childish', trying to act neurotypical (again to not be seen as weird by others), it all just...was me. (And I don't even want to get started on my need for routine and doing things a certain way - look my food has to be arranged in a certain way on the plate(s) and I also need to eat it in a certain order OK? \\[and that's just one example\\], lights and noises immensely bothering me, and everything else)\n\nAnd I hated it. I hate the fact that there clearly has been *something* going on with me all my life and instead of learning what that was when I was younger and trying to manage knowing that I've got it, I've instead just suffered internally because I've spent my entire life thinking this is how *everybody* is and we all suffer like this.\n\nBut then in a later chapter of the book where Price talks about people unmasking and arranging their home, work, etc. around their autism and all the strengths and struggles, their special interests, etc. rather than trying to hide it and suppress it and fit in with the neurotypical expectations of society. And it's like, *I want that*. I'm so tired of having to suppress myself for fear of being seen as weird, I'm tired of hiding some of my special interests because I'm afraid what other people may think of me if they know I have them, I'm so tired of it all - I just want to be *myself*.\n\nBut more than anything else, reading Unmasking Autism (in conjunction with all the research I've done) has finally given me the courage to admit it, it's given me the courage to admit what I've been unable to even admit to myself.\n\nI am autistic.\n\nI know that admitting this isn't magically going to make the impostor syndrome go away, but I have to just tell myself that I know myself and I shouldn't doubt what I am - I don't doubt that I'm transgender even when I occasionally faced imposter syndrome in my early days of realizing I was trans, after all - and I need to ignore people who say things like 'self-diagnosis isn't real, they're all just trying to be trendy' because that's just a vocal minority and focus on myself and everyone who supports self-dx'd and professionally-dx'd autistics. To once again compare it to me being trans, it's just like how I ignore transmed idiots.\n\nBut seriously, if you've read *all* of this (and I know it's long and rambly), thank you.",

        "text": "hi! I’m new here! *disclaimer to start* - I’ve recently been speculating for about half a year now on whether or not my mental illnesses are just a misdiagnosis that I’ve essentially had my whole life, or wondering if it was undetectable autism this whole time tbh.— I have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, depression, bipolar, and inattentive ADD, (something else I always struggle with is food intake) ((I also am iffy on the bipolar diagnosis but I resonate with everything else)) I seen several specialists and been on several meds for years but then I quit seeking help *cold turkey on/off for years* due to not really feeling like I was having my needs met. keep feeling like I’m in a constant state of impending doom “something bad is going to happen” is all I can think abt most days, I’ve never felt content/safe or comfortable with myself. Rejection fear is very real in my life. Medicated or not, I just felt *bad* — Interacting is a chore, I get exhausted+mentally check out when I socialize longer than I wanted to, I used to have to nap every day after a morning barista shift of 2 yrs (old job) and I thought it was just me *being tired* because I was never someone who needed nor wanted to nap unless I was really sick or severely exhausted from not sleeping enough so I always thought that was weird looking back at it now— it was a job that I needed to communicate with people 24/7 so I was always coming home absolutely drained. \nThere’s waaaay more negative things I struggle with daily but I will save that for another day, however i’m here today to ask about “gifts” or “gifted kids” and how it’s been somewhat correlated to autism/neurodivergence— most common one I’ve heard of for some people is the excelled reading skills at a v young age. I resonate to this one for example- in kindergarten I was reading at 1st - 2nd grade level, I liked fictional stories but not a lot because I knew it wasn’t *real* - my interest for reading wasn’t as prominent bc I preferred biographies and informative books. I’m also a very literal thinker so I wonder if this is a culprit as to why I prefer *true stories* {another example—} I was deemed musically gifted as a kid. I started singing probably before I started talking regularly as a tot. The first song I became obsessed with at age 3-4 was What’s Going On // 4 Non Blondes. Age 6-7 I developed an obsession for pianos. Started playing it one day and I would play for hours, in solitude in my own world, and I was actually trying to play music and not aggressively smash the keys like most typical kids do. *I actively got mad when kids would play obnoxiously, like plz stop it sounds like garbage and you’re only hurting my ears* so the longer I played, the more skills I developed over time—I was then able to start performing songs on the piano by ear with no sheet music reading ability—Just memorize the pitches and tune by ear and my mom was wigging out lol. She called it a gift and lil kid me never understood why she thought it was the greatest thing ever lol i just thought I was simply playing a piano",

In 9th grade, I decided that I’d be much happier being purposefully weird and obnoxious than putting in effort to get everyone to like me (“eff you, I’m going to do what I want and I don’t care what you think of me!”). As a 28 year old, I feel this has led to a lack of self awareness and deficiency in my social skills that I am currently working on improving. One of my realizations is that I may be autistic.\n\nSomething I’ve struggled to understand is this idea of social cues and how autistic people can miss them. Given my lack of understanding and learned purposeful ignorance of basic social norms, I feel like I don’t understand more nuanced forms of adult communication.\n\nWas my amplified lack of skills a way to mask how I don’t understand social skills in the first place? Perhaps. I likely purposefully miss social cues, but as I peel back the layers, I’m not how much of my reactions are because I want to make joke and how much of them come from a real place and a lack of understanding. Am I joking on purpose by purposefully making my lack of skills the butt of a joke to be comfortable with myself? Or am I saying it like a joke because if I don’t, people will make me the joke?\n\n*****My question is: What are social cues? What is their purpose? What are some examples of NT people using cues? How might a ND person misinterpret the cue and how might the NT people react? How would I know if I missed a cue?\n\nI’m struggling to look for something that I have no idea of what it’s supposed to look like.",

        "text": "Hopefully this is the right place to post this, do point me in the right direction if not.\n\nMy boyfriend and I are in our early twenties. We are each other's firsts for everything. He had been diagnosed as autistic as a child, which he shared with me fairly early on in our relationship. I appreciated this as it helped me make sense of certain small things that felt strange or unexpected. We clicked instantly and the first 6 months of our relationship was everything I had hoped it would be. However, as time passed, issues with communication between us started to show. \n\nI'll give you an example from one of our early dates, where we went the full mile on a 'traditional' date. A meal in the city, then a movie, followed by what I hoped was a walk down one of the nicer parks. I was beaming when we left the movies, excited to spend more time with him, when all of a sudden I noticed how withdrawn he was behaving. Any attempts at conversation were followed by monosyllabic answers. He looked noticeable less animated than when the date started, and my first reaction to this was to feel disappointed and hurt. He really looked like he was bored of everything and just wanted to go home. \n\nThat was eventually replaced by understanding when I realised he was overwhelmed. We skipped the walk and went home, and I began thinking about more quiet dates we could have in the future, such as picnics in the park or at-home activities. As an introvert with social anxiety I am happy to make this change.\n\nThe problem, and why I am making this post now, was that none of this was communicated. We have not discussed his discomfort/overwhelm, nor have we discussed plans around it. This event and future events made me realise that in fact, he never communicates his needs. He goes above and beyond to make sure *my* needs are met, while completely suppressing his own.\n\nI did a bit of reading to make sense of why, and it looks that behaviours such as people pleasing are a common trauma response by autistic people. So I have a better understanding of why he does this now... but I don't know how to navigate around this.\n\nWhat makes this even more complicated is that I'm fairly confident he has an internalised hatred towards his autistic identity. So any conversations that even *hints* towards accommodations are met with accusations such as, 'you don't trust me' or deflections such as, 'I feel fine, don't worry about it.'\n\nSo now I feel stuck. I don't know how to bring up the subject of him expressing his needs, and making sure they're met, without hurting him or making him feel attacked. This is an issue for me because, if he suppresses his needs for my sake for too long, I am afraid he will grow resentful of me. Just thinking about that outcome makes my heart hurt. He takes good care of me and I want to do the same back. He is a complete closed book sometimes and I wish I had a better understanding of the thoughts in his head. \n\nThis is quite a complicated issue and I'm not sure if there is an easy answer, but I'd like to ask anyway. How can I encourage him to be more comfortable expressing 'negative' emotions? Overwhelm, discomfort, things like that. And how do I frame it in such a way that he knows I am comfortable with his autistic identity? Any insights or experiences would be appreciated.",

        "text": "tl;dr: I had this enlightening conversation with my best friend where I realised that I am desperately looking for someone that is \"structurally\" similar to me because I have always felt alone. \n\nI have always kind of felt different. As a child, I was proud of my weirdness and used it to, theatrically, make other people laugh. I had an identity crisis when I was 15, two years ago, where I isolated myself from everyone. But since last year, I have been craving human interactions. The thought of finding someone similar to me, that would understand me constantly runs in the back of my mind and is one of the main reasons (aside from the enrichment that others can bring and the need to have a thought outlet) why I seek social relationships.\nI am looking for someone that can meet my expectations that, for me, aren't that high because I can meet them with no problems. But everyone else tells me they're too high. For instance, with my best friend, my mind focuses on him very intensely and I almost have his schedule mentally sitting next to mine. And, ironically, having this focus on someone else allows me to be more concentrated on myself because I feel more aware and present through others. Now, I thought, he also did this but he doesn't do it to my degree so I feel like he's not interested in me. And he told me many times that my expectations were too much. To feel less alone, I often assimilate myself to the typical narrative of \"a lonely romantic artist and philosopher from the 1800s that is different from everyone else because of his acute sensitivity to everything\". And then I found the word autistic that highly resonated with me in every aspect of my life but since I have not been diagnosed I don't feel entitled to use it.\nBy writing this post, I would like to know if this feeling on a quest is a common experience among autistic folks. Or if it's on the contrary just a way for me to find an excuse to not reduce my expectations and adapt more.",

Well my test has my Autistic traits except Social as fairly high, with Talent being very high, while my NT Perception is extremely high, but the rest of my NT scores are extremely low. I've always felt different but I can handle most social situations well. At what point do I consider looking to get diagnosed?

I was diagnosed ADHD as a teen, and I was always called “spacey” and a daydreamer as a child. \n\nI have never thought of myself as having significant sensory issues, I do just fine in all kinds of environments, but I’ve always hated seams in socks and wearing socks in general— I’ll try to wear sandals long past the appropriate season. Also my interoception sense is very poor: I have trouble recognizing when I’m hungry so will accidentally miss meals, and I have trouble recognizing when I have to pee until it’s too late so learned as a kid to just go to the bathroom regularly. \n\nI have had habits like fidgeting, biting cuticles, picking at my skin that have been present since at least early teen years— I don’t know if this is stimming or an OCD or ADHD thing. \n\nI have extreme social anxiety/social difficulty but only in certain settings. I don’t do well in groups- I don’t know when to speak (I think that’s also an ADHD thing) and worry people will think what I say is dumb. I don’t like speaking one on one with men because I worry they might think I’m giving off vibes of being interested in them when I’m not. When I’m around new people I feel uncomfortable and hate small talk. \n\nI often develop intense interests, and spend an inordinate amount of time on them. \n\nMy executive functioning is not great (but that’s an ADHD thing too). \n\nHowever, since childhood I’ve always had at least a couple of friends and have been able to maintain these relationships for long periods of time. I’ve even had the occasional friend who was a social butterfly/very socially adept. I feel self conscious a lot but not exactly like I’m trying to hide who I really am, and I feel quite comfortable around my close friends. My friends sometimes say I’m funny and have a good sense of humor. \n\nOnline tests usually score me borderline but I never know how to answer- the questions always seem very black and white (like “are you a sympathetic person”- I guess I would say I am but I don’t know if I am significantly less so than others?) \n\nWould you say my social skills probably exclude me?",

        "text": "As we all probably know, mental illness is very stigmatized. Because of this, I heard words like “narcissist” and “psychopath” thrown around a lot as a child, always in regards to other people that the adults in my life had issues with. People that seemed selfish or unaware of others feelings or needs were narcissists, people that displayed nonsensical behaviors or tried to manipulate others were psychopaths, and anyone that could relate to other people was an “empath”. I heard pop psychology jargon all around me, but mostly didn’t pay much attention to it. As I got older though, I became drawn to the subject of psychology, mostly the categories and classifications of mental illnesses and disorders. I love the fact that every disorder is categorized into types with all their own list of traits/behaviors/symptoms, and for a while, I kind of saw the DSM-5 or various other diagnostics manuals as like a manual to analyze and think about human behavior (and i still sort of do. Like when someone tells me certain characteristics or struggles they have Im automatically running through all the possible illness/disorders they might fit the criteria for. Not in a “creepy” way, and I don’t typically share this information unless I feel they genuinely fit all or most of the traits/symptoms and would really benefit from further research/seeing a professional for it. I’ve never tried to “diagnose” anyone and I’m certainly not a professional, though I hope to work as a therapist in the future. I’m also aware that our current understanding of mental disorders is limited and only a small piece of the puzzle we have to discover). But, I’ve noticed that other people actually really dislike when you have a more through understanding of psychology and human behavior than they do. Like, it’s fine and totally acceptable to go around calling everyone that disagrees with you or treats you badly a narcissist, but when I throughly explain why I think my little brother clearly fits the criteria for ADHD and struggles all the time at home, I’m “overthinking it” and nothing is done about it. It’s normalized to stigmatize and generalize about Schizophrenia, but when I deduce that various members of my family clearly have Autistic/ADHD traits, or may suffer from OCD, or some other illness/disorder, it’s a problem. I guess this is more of a vent because I know full well why this happens, it’s stigma, it just frustrates me to no end. It’s not wrong or bad to be different, to “function” differently than other people. It’s okay to be disabled and it’s okay to be mentally ill. All of it is simply humanity.",

But I don't know if that would be the stimuli that is making be anxious or if I'm noticing it *because* I'm anxious\n\nIf you're very sensitive to specific sensory input of course this wouldn't be a problem, like if you know loud noises hurt and scare and stress the hell out of you of course you'd assume in a loud place, that's what's making you upset. But I'm still figuring out what things I'm sensitive to since I'm not as reactive to them as I was as a child and I don't know to what extent I mask.\n\nThis looks longer than it needed to be.

And if I do look at them while talking I look at a certain body part e.g nose or forehead. Also whenever my friends or a group of friends are talking I always look around at different things til I see something interesting e.g a bird (I like birds and will always stop to look at them when on walks) but I will still keep my focus on the conversation.\n\n1.2 Speech problems;\nEver since I was young I have always been very quiet, its not that I dont talk its that my volume is very low. I  always get asked to speak up and I will for about a sentence then I will automatically go back to speaking in a low volume again unconciously. (Subconsciously?)\n\n1.2.1 Way of speech;\nWhenever I am talking I know the words I am looking for and I structure the sentence beforehand but when I actually say it its like it is dumbed down and I dont get the whole thing out so it becomes a jumbled mess\n\n1.3 Asking things I already know\nUsually when I am at a place and I want to e.g throw away some trash I ask \"Where is your trashcan\" even though I already know where it is, my mom has confronted me about it several times and asked me why, I dont have an answer though\n\n\n2 Sensory Issues\n\n2.1 Food;\nWhen it comes to food if i eat anything with the wrong kind of texture or taste e.g slimy or mushy I will barely be able to eat it. A few examples include Olives, Mangoes, Pineapples, Beans\n\n2.2 Sound;\nSince I always tend to look around and focus on multiple things at the same time it makes me notice weird sounds and for some reason I always point them out like if a bird makes a noise I will tell my friends there is a bird there and stare at it while walking past or if there is a dog I will do the same or a bus Also I find it really hard to tune out of sounds e.g conversations near me I will most likely involuntarily overhear them even if i try not to\n\n2.3 Clothing\nI usually wear the same types of clothes and if i dont i will feel very uncomfortable, If i wear a shirt instead of a hoodie I will feel weird for the whole day (that is probably normal for alot of people though)\n\n2.4 \"stimming\"\nWhenever I am stressed or nervous I will start playing with things around me e.g drum on the table, scratch my head, play with my glasses or recently I got a fun fidget cube that I will use when I am feeling nervous",

        "text": "TW: meltdown mention, homophobia, meltdown symptoms. \n\nLow needs autistic person here. Sorry for length in advance, but it is necessary. I recently had a situation in which me (21M) and my sister (23F), we’re having a small conversation that casually evolved into me mentioning having therapy at home as well as school. My other sister (21F) started listening like halfway into the convo. 23F asked several questions about why I went, I responded, she still didn’t seem to understand and was frustrated that I said our parents were homophobic and that things they did were homophobic. She tried to justify why they felt the way they did and basically said ‘well the Bible says this so it’s wrong to them.’ And said I needed to get over it because people are going to disagree with me regardless.\n\nI casually said I understand that and that I don’t hate our parents, but these little things do hurt and I do need to talk to someone about this. I apologized to her incase she felt like I was being rude and said I just don’t know if I want to talk about this anymore.\n\n23F then asked me if I kept bringing up the same stuff in therapy and said it sounded like I was super stuck on [insert small moment in which I felt parents were homophobic]. \n\nI then sat up and slammed my water bottle down on the table. And started to say loudly, ‘why can’t you just understand I don’t want to talk about therapy’ and walked away to go upstairs, slammed a gate behind me. 21F then yelled and called me childish. She and 23F drove away. \n\nI should clarify, as the conversation continued, I started to feel more uncomfortable, anxious, and pressing my hand to my head as I was sitting on the couch. I’m usually able to somewhat make eye contact especially with people I’m comfortable with, but I couldn’t do it at all throughout this conversation. I got more irritated and frustrated when I realized 23F really didn’t agree on how to feel about our parents and that she disagreed on definition of homophobia.\n\nMy mouth started to twitch uncontrollably as I sat up, slammed my water bottle down, and went walking away quickly as I said what I said earlier. However, I immediately felt overwhelmingly embarrassed and afraid when 21F called me childish and started shouting and left. I was shaking a little bit and kinda froze in place for about 30 seconds. I saw the car leave and was still (silently) panicked for like next 10 minutes. But the initial reaction lasted for like not even 30 seconds.\n\nI didn’t even think to consider this could be an autistic meltdown because I have never ever done something like this in front of people before since I was a preteen. Both sisters called this a temper tantrum after we had a talk two days ago and I agreed. We all said this voluntarily happened. I apologized a lot, we kind of just moved on. \n\nBut now I’m not sure anymore. I talked to therapist and realized after therapy that what actually upset me during the conversation was realizing 23F was really that detached from what I thought. It took me by surprise and really hurt and made me super anxious. I didn’t explode. I did flee for like 30 to 45 seconds. I don’t know if that’s because I felt a meltdown coming? I’m having trouble identifying what to call this.\n\nCan anyone ask me questions or help verify what exactly happened here? I’m happy to clarify and need more autistic people to help me clarify this. I feel crazy right now.",

        "text": "Going back to work on Saturday after 3 weeks is bittersweet. I don't hate my job and I needed a break. The first week off I was really happy and then by the middle of my break I was like \"yeah, it's time to go back to work\" even if I wanted a break from working I would work 2-3 days a week to have a routine.\n\nI feel that having no routine make my mental health go down as I am not achieving anything and I am so sucked into myself. Even if I make a routine with all my hobbies I think I need extrinsic motivation despite not liking to work with others. It is kind of my fault for waking up at noon almost everyday.. winter is boring and hard here..not the best excuse lol\n\nEven on vacation (previous ones abroad), I have gotten depressed because I have \"nothing going for me\" and I have to plan all my activities. Maybe because I took them alone.. idk",

        "text": "Today I woke up and felt the great need to use my bracelet (it's a pretty common bracelet, made of what I think are threads, it can be adjusted and unadjusted as I want). Basically with my hand that is not wearing the bracelet, I take the remaining threads of the bracelet after having adjusted it and with my fingers I begin to roll them from one side to the other repetitively. I really like the texture and how it feels to touch it. I've been doing this for as long as I can remember with all kinds of medium-sized and cylindrical objects like lollipop sticks or even with the soft fabric of my clothes or even the clothes of other people if I noticed the fabricis nice (I forget to ask permission and I end up apologizing because I'm making contact with someone without permission).\nI can do this activity for hours without stopping and several times I find myself doing it unconsciously, which sometimes scares me haha. Once I tried not to do any of this for a whole day and after hours I was having a little trouble breathing, as if my chest was squeezing my lungs, my head also started to hurt a bit and I ended up feeling very anxious about wearing the bracelet.\nI've never been clear if this is stimming or not, I know it's a repetitive movement that I do and I think it helps me calm down or at least keep my hands busy doing something (for some reason I can never keep my hands to themselves).\n\nI wanted to know if anyone else does this? Or if you can tell me if this is stimming or not.",

        "text": "I’m 28 years old, never really knew what autism was until I was probably like 24-25. When my ex wife said that she was talking to someone about me and they said I showed traits of autism. Then I found out I was trans. Then I met my current wife. In the couple of years between my ex wife and current wife I decided to get to know myself on a different level. Still not sure what autism is. It was only in the last year that I realized “oh crap I may actually be autistic.” We make a lot of jokes about autism in my house because we all have ADHD, autism, and ADD. (There’s a lot more we go through but just for the sake of this story we will leave it at that). My nephew is diagnosed autistic while the adults just say stuff about their sensory issues mainly. But that’s when it clicked for me. I share a lot of traits with my nephew and so it makes sense to me that I am. I have asked all of my life “why am I different?” “Why can’t I make friends?” “Why do I go mute when I’m fighting with my wife?” “Why do I rub my arms when my skin is cold?” “Why do I suck on my tongue when I have anxiety?” These were all things I have dealt with for as long as I can remember. I asked my bio-mom if she thinks I’m autistic and she said some really nasty hurtful things about autistic people that I refuse to repeat. So I think she knows I’m autistic but just like my oldest brother who also has some form of disability, we are her “perfect smart children.” I guess my question here has anyone else noticed something like this too?",
