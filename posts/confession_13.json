        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I was 16-17M I had a drinking problem. I would drink whenever I could get my hands on alcohol because it was the only way I knew how to escape. I would do all kind of stupid shit when I was drunk, try to fight people, verbally abuse people for no reason, throw up in peoples houses etc. i would often get angry at my parents for no reason and once I even had a fight with my dad. \n\n2 yrs ago aged 17 I met up with 3 girls and a male friend. I had had a lot to drink at this rate. I was sitting in a bench with one of the girls and I put my arm around her. She did not object to this so I thought I was on the next stage of flirting. I asked ro kiss her, she said no to that. A minute later I asked again and a minute after that I asked once more. All 3 times were rejected. Eventually i came to my senses and realise my attention was unwanted. I feel as though if I was physically stepping the line someone would have intervened. I cant actually remember any of this happening, this is just what I got told. I never forced myself on this person and I didn‚Äôt get aggressive or violent when rejected. After this happened she and all her friends left the venue and texted my friend that I fucked up and that no means no. I probably freaked her out bad. I didn‚Äôt understand what I was doing and I thought I was flirting but I got it horribly wrong and upset someone \n\nEveryone alienated me after this, all 4 people involved stopped talking to me. My friend was extremely angry with me and started calling me a harasser. \nDue to the response provided I have false memories of what happened. I only asked for a kiss but my mind keeps telling me that I groped/raped her because of how angry everyone was after the situation. I live in constant mental imprisonment. \nI know for a fact I had no bad intentions but in my drunken state I got it horribly wrong. \n\n\n\n When I heard about my actions the next morning I felt disgusted with myself, I instantly apologised to the girl I did it to. \nLooking back it was quite s lame apology, I said some shit like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable last night I was really drunk‚Äù i didn‚Äôt know what to say\nShe told me she forgave me, my friend told me that she was initially upset after it had happened that I pushed her boundaries, but she accepted my apology. I don‚Äôt know if she just said this to make me feel better or what not but yeah. That was the last time i spoke to all the people involved. I feel disgusted within myself, I feel like a predator who kept pushing someone. I feel as though I might have traumatised her and ruined her life cos this was such a bad experience. It was after that I stopped drinking alcohol as a whole because I was now aware of its destructive nature. I haven‚Äôt done a thing of this nature since and realised that it was the alcohol dictating me. \n\nAfter I apologised I didn‚Äôt think too much of the incident, but 18 months later for some reason it‚Äôs come back into my mind and it‚Äôs all I think about 24/7. I really can‚Äôt understand why I did what I did. I certainly wouldn‚Äôt have done it sober, but I‚Äôve realised that it‚Äôs no excuse. Their friend said to my friend it wasn‚Äôt that much of a big deal but I still can‚Äôt forget about it. \nI feel like a piece of shit for trying to do something without the other person‚Äôs consent. I was verbally asking for consent but I was being pushy about it. \nSince this has been of my mind, I haven‚Äôt allowed myself to have anormal life, I‚Äôve since quit my job and I hardly leave my room. I feel as though this is who I‚Äôm gonna be forever. That drunk idiot that kept asking. I told one of my friends bout it and he said it wasn‚Äôt a big deal. I can‚Äôt even look my own mother in the eye knowing the way I treated a woman that night. No charges were ever pressed or anything, idk if I did something illegal or not but it was certainly immoral. \nI don‚Äôt know if asking for a kiss more than once is illegal (might fall under harassment) \nBut I feel I should‚Äôve received some punishment for my actions \nI hate myself for it every day and I‚Äôve been thinking about ending my life over this. Once u do something like this in todays society there is no going back. \n\n\nAlthough im 2 years sober and wont do something like this again I just cant let the past go. This haunts me 24/7 and honestly, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever forgive myself for it. \nI thought of myself as an ally of women but this situation says that I wasn‚Äôt. \n\nI‚Äôm a pig. A disgusting man who ignored boundaries. I‚Äôm sorry to all women that have to deal w shit like this. I‚Äôve heard some horror stories from some other girls and the stuff u have to put up with us disgusting. I wouldn‚Äôt consider myself a part of that domain but this encounter proves otherwise. \n\nI physically cry my eyes out when I see my mother. I‚Äôve failed her, she told me to respect women growing up and I fucked it.",

        "text": "I once had an ex when we were just a couple of naive 18 year olds thinking we could make long distance work...She was so brilliant with a high level of intelligence. She was partially physically disabled in her hand due to circumstances very early in life. Why do I mention this detail? Because it highlighted how much of a badass she was regardless.\n\nBecause in spite of a disability which would render the regular person discouraged from many career fields, and having to grow up without her dad, she rose above and conquered with her incredibly high I.Q. Truth be told, I was always jealous of her intellect and it bothered me, you know?? Ironically, first time I ever found her was chatting with complete strangers on the internet. We lived a state away from each other, though it was 5 hours away, too far and expensive at that time for me to travel to meet. \n\nFirst words I believe I uttered to her were along the lines of: \"College? No?\". I came off as confrontational because at the time i was hotheaded and just didnt want to talk to people smarter than me, but i did get pulled in by her kindness and open acceptance of me. Long story short we chatted more and more until things progressed and we began developing strong feelings. \n\nLong distance didnt work out the way it usually never does. Her mother hated the idea of her dating a person outside of her race and educational goals, but really any male for that matter, so the girl had to basically hide me from view. Her mom was tough, went through alot and was protective but we were in what a typical young adult would think of as love. Despite her mom's strict warning for me to buzz off, we kept sneaking online to keep the relationship going. It felt like a romcom movie or something \n\n Sometimes we watched tv together over Skype like old drake and josh episodes while talking about the future we'd have together. It was cute sure, but over time I would belittle this girl, call her names and the jealous anxiety that existed for us being long distance was too much to handle and we split years ago. Partially due to distance and also from me becoming a real hateful psycho of a boyfriend. \n\nI think she just couldnt really decide in that stage of her life to commit to a person. Neither of us really could yet. We were too young to be serious about life after all..She began hating my guts really bad. I dont blame her. I was never up to par with her place in society at all. She had a future planned out and I had pretty much nothing besides the tablet I spoke to her on every day. It's been close to a decade since we \"met\" online and I still can't get over her. Nobody can replace her in my memory.\n\n Part of me just thinks had we met at the age we are now after all that's happened, maybe things would have been drastically different for the best, but it's far too late now. We never did get to meet in person. I was just one in many other men she's ever come across from the internet, many of which who dated her both long distance and in person after me.  In her mind I may no longer exist in memory. It's been too long at this point. I did stay with her for about almost a year, but in the grand scheme of a decade, idk. It just kinda fades away with time for some. I don't know why I'm the only person who cannot get over this type of separation though. \n\nAs years passed, we grew so far apart to the point of strict blocking on all methods of communication like social media and phone numbers. I am sure by now she is fairly successful and highly esteemed to whoever knows her. I'm the opposite,  and esteemed lowly with a high level of contention in my own community. I've dated three other women since her, all of which in person, and dumped me very early on in relationships. One of the three others actually dumped me because of the fact I still think about the first ex. There was something about her that to this day about ten years later really got the best of me.\n\n A large part of me wonders how she's doing out there. I always envisioned us decorating a christmas tree together. When that time of year comes around it always bothers me and idk. Even when I had other girlfriends, I still felt the sting from her specifically no matter how much time passes. \n\nShe's moved on completely by now and is in a happy relationship I want no part in interfering with. I really am not bothered if she never contacts me again. I mainly just want her to smile and live a fulfilling life more than anything, and hey if that means without me, I guess that's one of the hardballs in life I gotta prepare for. \n\nSorry for the long novel. Just had to get this out there. Cant keep it contained in my mind forever  I had to share my feelings",

I am so attracted to her and love our sex, I just so badly want to feel wanted by her and to have her attention. It‚Äôs gotten to the point that my self confidence is at an all time low because of the constant rejection. I‚Äôve talked to her several times and am just tired of pleading my case honestly.

        "text": "For the record I have never been in trouble with law enforcement and have always been respectful of people who show me respect.\n\nOne night I was walking home from a friends house. It was late and my friends had all been drinking. My friends were all completely drunk, but I never drink as alcohol doesn't agree with me. I left the party alone because I didn't want to babysit a bunch of drunks anymore. While I was walking home I got approached by a man with his hood up. The moment I saw him I could sense by the way he was walking towards me that he was coming for me. He walked towards me as bold as brass and it was obvious to me he was going to try and hurt me the moment I tried to walk to the side and he stepped to the side to approach me. I thought about running away, but I also was worried he'd pull out a gun so didn't.\n\nWhen he got up close he pulled out a knife and started demanding my phone and wallet. I begged him not to hurt me and he got more agitated and began threatening to stab me. I handed him my phone and then when I was handing my wallet he dropped it. In that split second I guess I saw weakness and an opening so I swung for him. I ended up knocking him to the ground and continued to punch and kick him while he was down.\n\nI continued until he stopped fighting back. I kicked his knife into the road and then down a drainage grid. I then took my stuff back. I reached into his pocket and pulled out my phone alongside some cash and his own mobile. I threw his phone into the drain where I kicked the knife. The cash was around $50 and I kept it for compensation / scaring me. He was wearing nice air jordans so I took those too and left him on the ground.\n\nThe whole situation filled me with an unexplainable high. I couldn't believe I got away with it and the whole ordeal made me feel an insane adrenaline rush. I would never mug a person in usual circumstances, but in that moment I did and I have no regrets because the guy genuinely deserved it.\n\nI never got consequences for this. It was many years ago and although I don't condone violence it makes me feel really good about myself that I didn't let that fucker steal my shit. I had irreplaceable photos / texts of deceased family members that I would never be able to get back. The whole situation was a reality check and I ended up backing up all those photos and buying a fake decoy phone in case that even happens again next time. \n\nI won't ever try my luck like that again. I'm not stupid, I know I shouldn't be here right now.",

        "text": " \n\nI never thought that my CPR training would come in handy so soon after completing the course. It was a beautiful afternoon, and I was strolling in the park when I noticed a commotion near the pond. As I got closer, I saw a non-binary person of color on a wheelchair lying on the ground, gasping for breath. A few people were trying to help, but they seemed unsure of what to do.\n\nWithout a second thought, I rushed to the person's side and assessed the situation. It was clear that the person wasn't breathing and had no pulse. I immediately called for someone to dial 911 and then started CPR. I tried to remember everything I had learned during my training, and I just focused on the rhythm of chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.\n\nIt felt like time stood still as I continued to perform CPR. The paramedics arrived shortly after and took over. I felt a sense of relief wash over me as I watched the person being rushed to the hospital.\n\nI later found out that the person had a mental disability and that their caretaker wasn't able to administer CPR. The person's life was saved because I happened to be there at the right time, and I knew what to do.\n\nReflecting on the incident, I realized that it's essential to be prepared for emergencies. You never know when you might need to use your CPR training to save someone's life. And when you do, it's important to remain calm and remember what you've learned. Everyone should consider taking a CPR course because it could make a significant difference in someone's life.\n\nThe moral of this story is that being prepared and knowledgeable can save lives. We should all strive to learn essential skills that could make a difference in an emergency situation. You never know when you might be the one who can make a difference.",

I was in the lunch room in school and we have a snack line. It's where you can get snacks and drinks like ice cream, chips, soda, water, etc. It also costs money. I sit at the end of the cafeteria and I walk all the way to the other side to go to the snack line. I have a friend that sits by the snack line and whenever I go over there he tells me to buy him something. I go there almost everyday but it's not too big of a deal because my parents make alot of money(were not rich but not poor either). He only tells me to buy bags of chips which are 50¬¢ and really cheap so I get them for him. But today a girl in one of my classes tells me to buy her a water bottle which is 1$. I don't talk to her much but sometimes I do. I only brought 2$ with me to the snack line and I said no to her request. When I start buying my snacks, I buy my friend his chips, and I grab myself some chips too. I start going to the cashier but I decide to buy here, her water bottle. I bought everything,  which was 2$. I then give my friend his chips and then I give the girl the water bottle. I'm such a goddamn dumbass. I don't think she thought I was going to buy it for her because I said no but I did anyway. Her friends probably didn't expect it either and so they started laughing. Probably not at me but because she got the water bottle. I feel sad that I did it. I wasted a dollar on someone I hardly know. I wish I could just rewind time and not buy that water bottle or keep it for myself. I'm such a dumbass.",

I would drink whenever I could get my hands on alcohol because it was the only way I knew how to escape. I would do all kind of stupid shit when I was drunk, try to fight people, verbally abuse people for no reason, throw up in peoples houses etc. i would often get angry at my parents for no reason and once I even had a fight with my dad. \n\n2 yrs ago aged 17 I met up with 3 girls and a male friend. I had had a lot to drink at this rate. I was sitting in a bench with one of the girls and I put my arm around her. She did not object to this so I thought I was on the next stage of flirting. I asked ro kiss her, she said no to that. A minute later I asked again and a minute after that I asked once more. All 3 times were rejected. Eventually i came to my senses and realise my attention was unwanted. I feel as though if I was physically stepping the line someone would have intervened. I cant actually remember any of this happening, this is just what I got told. I never forced myself on this person and I didn‚Äôt get aggressive or violent when rejected. After this happened she and all her friends left the venue and texted my friend that I fucked up and that no means no. I probably freaked her out bad. I didn‚Äôt understand what I was doing and I thought I was flirting but I got it horribly wrong and upset someone \n\nEveryone alienated me after this, all 4 people involved stopped talking to me. My friend was extremely angry with me and started calling me a harasser. \nDue to the response provided I have false memories of what happened. I only asked for a kiss but my mind keeps telling me that I groped/raped her because of how angry everyone was after the situation. I live in constant mental imprisonment. \nI know for a fact I had no bad intentions but in my drunken state I got it horribly wrong. \n\n\n\n When I heard about my actions the next morning I felt disgusted with myself, I instantly apologised to the girl I did it to. \nLooking back it was quite s lame apology, I said some shit like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable last night I was really drunk‚Äù i didn‚Äôt know what to say\nShe told me she forgave me, my friend told me that she was initially upset after it had happened that I pushed her boundaries, but she accepted my apology. I don‚Äôt know if she just said this to make me feel better or what not but yeah. That was the last time i spoke to all the people involved. I feel disgusted within myself, I feel like a predator who kept pushing someone. I feel as though I might have traumatised her and ruined her life cos this was such a bad experience. It was after that I stopped drinking alcohol as a whole because I was now aware of its destructive nature. I haven‚Äôt done a thing of this nature since and realised that it was the alcohol dictating me. \n\nAfter I apologised I didn‚Äôt think too much of the incident, but 18 months later for some reason it‚Äôs come back into my mind and it‚Äôs all I think about 24/7. I really can‚Äôt understand why I did what I did. I certainly wouldn‚Äôt have done it sober, but I‚Äôve realised that it‚Äôs no excuse. Their friend said to my friend it wasn‚Äôt that much of a big deal but I still can‚Äôt forget about it. \nI feel like a piece of shit for trying to do something without the other person‚Äôs consent. I was verbally asking for consent but I was being pushy about it. \nSince this has been of my mind, I haven‚Äôt allowed myself to have anormal life, I‚Äôve since quit my job and I hardly leave my room. I feel as though this is who I‚Äôm gonna be forever. That drunk idiot that kept asking. I told one of my friends bout it and he said it wasn‚Äôt a big deal. I can‚Äôt even look my own mother in the eye knowing the way I treated a woman that night. No charges were ever pressed or anything, idk if I did something illegal or not but it was certainly immoral. \nI don‚Äôt know if asking for a kiss more than once is illegal (might fall under harassment) \nBut I feel I should‚Äôve received some punishment for my actions \nI hate myself for it every day and I‚Äôve been thinking about ending my life over this. Once u do something like this in todays society there is no going back. \n\n\nAlthough im 2 years sober and wont do something like this again I just cant let the past go. This haunts me 24/7 and honestly, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever forgive myself for it. \nI thought of myself as an ally of women but this situation says that I wasn‚Äôt. \n\nI‚Äôm a pig. A disgusting man who ignored boundaries. I‚Äôm sorry to all women that have to deal w shit like this. I‚Äôve heard some horror stories from some other girls and the stuff u have to put up with us disgusting. I wouldn‚Äôt consider myself a part of that domain but this encounter proves otherwise. \n\nI physically cry my eyes out when I see my mother. I‚Äôve failed her, she told me to respect women growing up and I fucked it.",
