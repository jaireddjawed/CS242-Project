While I can recognize that the internet has the problem of also making *sharing* of information more efficient, why would that \"outpace\" the authoritativeness of things that were once very standardized?\n\nFor example, if a person wanted to check to see if a word was real, they could use a Merriam Webster dictionary and whatever was stated within the book was taken at face value, and logically so; the same goes for encyclopedias. \n\nNowadays, if someone wants to educate themselves on a topic, it's *extremely* difficult to find information that's unbiased, regardless of the actual concept. Why do (and I speak as someone who lives in the US; this may be different in some nations) I, as a consumer, have to not only find news articles, but also find articles that try to validate those articles?\n\nWhy is it so hard to find reliable information? Why isn't there a stronger push for neutral journalism and neutral academic work? While I understand that there never has been a point where information has been 100% reliable, what has caused this growing \"endangerment\" of authoritative sources? \n\nIf that needs any better clarification, please don't be afraid to ask!
