However I haven't really been able to fully grasp the various concepts that make up the theory, ie Time dilation, length contraction, etc. I was hoping the knowledgeable members of the reddit community could provide some answers to my questions.\n\n*As far as I understand it the theory describes the relation between two inertial reference frames based on a common event(s) in these frames. Am I correct in my definition?\n\n*One of the first things to come up after introducing SR was time dilation. I can understand it in the context of the diagram in the textbook, essentially a reference frame (S') with two mirrors and a photon reflecting back and forth in a vertical fashion. The S' is moving with relative velocity to frame S. From the frame of S the photon appears to move in a diagonal fashion thus taking longer to return to the first mirror. I understand how to gather the time dilation equation from this structure but I have some questions regarding it. Is the photon a part of the S' system or is it completely independent from the system? Secondly, I was working on a question dealing with time dilation involving a decaying muon moving relative to an observer on earth. I'm having trouble translating the procedures from the previous example to this one. Can the time dilation equation be derived from the muon?\n\n*Length Contractions: I'm not sure if I understand this concept or not. The examples given in the textbook are seemingly contradictory and every other explanation hasn't been helpful. Can someone explain this one to me?\n\nHopefully your explanations can help me understand these concepts and the later ones involving relative momentum and energy.\n\nThanks in advance for the help.",

The surface of spacetime in point A would smoothen out as the object moved away from point A, and the surface of spacetime in B would become more curved as the object approached point B. \n\nWe would expeirience this alteration of the gravitational field as gravitational waves, IN THEORY. I know gravitational waves haven't been detected yet. In Stephen Hawkings book 'A Brief History of Time' the following sentece is written: ''Gravitational waves take energy away from the object emitting them''\n \nMy question is that if this is true, would it mean that an object moving through vacuum, without any forces acting upon it, would eventually lose more and more energy because it's emitting gravitational waves constantly in theory?

I once read that through mathematics, scientists could math how old the universe is, until the maths they use fail, shortly after the big bang.  I have always wondered why the big bang couldn't have been the explosive expansion of an infinitely massive point in hyperspace, that came about upon the collapse of that same resulting universe.  I understand cosmic background radiation as a layman, but I think the following still holds up to the evidence scientists have scienced out already:\n\nBecause there's no beginning or end, I start in the middle.  There's this expanding universe.  It's a he.  His name is Lance.  So, Lance is expanding at whatever rate accelerating like a badass, right?  Is it possible that Lance gets over that, and the stuff he's made of starts pulling everything back in?  We know Lance is a big boy, and there's a lot of stuff in him, so if contraction started taking place after some super long deceleration of expansion, wouldn't Lance feel more force once he starts to get small?  Like stars do when they collapse?  So he starts getting super small, and all that matter is still there, and it squeezes Lance into that infinitely massive point, until Lance blows up again, causing all of the resulting cosmic background radation to be evenly shmeared again.  What if Lance keeps swinging back and forth like a pendulum over time?  No beginning, no end, just swinging.  Is there big (or small, who am I kidding) astrophysics stuff that says that can't happen?  He's got an unfortunate name, but Lance is alright.  Can we keep him?",

I guess if the mass of this planet is larger but gravity is the same, then it needs to be less dense. Can I just use less iron, or maybe an entirely different material would be better, like nickel?\nAlso, would you expect this planet to be the same distance from the sun as Earth is, or does its size and/or satellites make some sort of difference?",

And because the text book says it's right...well it's right.  I will destroy you, your family, and your planet if you even mention a higher being(s).\n\nAnyways on to my point...\n\nI've been obsessed with Einsteins theories about space, time and his theory of gravity. I haven't had a good nights sleep in days. I just can't accept it. I know he's a genius but even geniuses are wrong sometimes.\n\nFrom what I've read up on space is NOT a trampoline like everyone says it is, it's not just a flat plane, it surrounds everything. Object like the sun and the earth will warp space and time creating an indentation somewhat in space. Einstein says that this warp in space causes the planets to rotate around the central object along the path of least resistance.\n\nThis doesn't make sense to me. I feel like the planets and moons would end up getting closer and closer to the sun because of centripetal force(at museums they have those things where you drop a coin in and it goes around and around until it gets to the middle). Yet the planets move closer AND farther apart.\n\nEinsteins theory does not explain how the moon and the sun affect tides. The earth will bulge out(imagine an egg) where the high tides are where the water bulges towards the sun and/or moon. So this shows that there is an attraction between the two objects. From what I get out of the Einsteins theory is that the gravity of the sun and moon would have no effect of the the tides at all.\n\nAnd then you have things like pluto that revolves around the sun in a really funky way. If space was warped by the sun then i feel like the effect on the planets would be mostly that same with the affects getting smaller the farther away you get, but still..similar.\n\nI am a software engineer, not a physicist but I am curious. Please someone, help me before I get a brain tumor.\n\nBut I guess I should just believe it the good book says it right....right?\n",

Another would be that could it be possible that \"our\" time not real and it is in a loop: like the hawking curve theory that time folds on itself?\n\nIf the other strings: which would denote that there are other universes (assuming that the same laws apply) would effect our universe?\n\n",
