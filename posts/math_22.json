However, in this class, all of the lecture material and assignments are in terms of proofs, lemmas, propositions, etc… and requires writing my own proofs. This is not something I’m especially used to, so I’m having trouble studying the material in an effective manner.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips on how an engineer can get a better grasp on proof-based techniques? Also, when faced with a new problem, how do you usually approach solving it at first?",

However, I am wondering what you guys think about this format. Would you like to study mathematics in this form? I think it's a nice way to gamify mathematics. \n\nEach chapter follows some well established mathematics textbook, so you can follow the original book and at the same time consult at the formal code, copy-paste it and experiment yourself. You can try to very rigorously solve the exercises from the textbook as well.\n\nCurrently i have a implementation the first chapters of Jacobson's \"basic algebra\" and Morris' \"Topology without tears\".

I need to be able to determine which item is at item number X, when gaps could emerge in the sequence. So deleting 3, instead of index 5 as the fifth element, it would be index 6 for example. Any number of items could be deleted from the list, and the max length is anything within uint256. \n\nI can track the total size of the list, as well as an active length (so if you delete something, it decrements). I can also track an aggregate of the total index values, as well as an aggregate of the active index values, or any calculation derived from those values (ie: if squares help isolate what I need, I can square/root the values as needed). \n\nWhat scalar value(s) might I be missing in order to determine which indexes you'll find gaps, or alternatively/more to the need being solved for, arrive at the correct active index for a given numerical \"place in list\" value? Or for this potential formula, the number of removed items _below_ a given number (which should then make it simply number + offset for the correct index).\n\nExample of the math assuming 3 and 7 are removed:\n\nsize: 10\nlength: 8 (so I know 2 elements have been deleted)\nindexAggregate:55 (I know the total index value assuming no deletions)\nactiveAggregate:45 (I know the 2 values removed total 10... but can't isolate 3 and 7 vs 6 and 4, etc)\n\nSquares feel like might help solve for isolating specific values, or maybe some combination of a linear aggregation paired with an aggregation of the squares... but I feel like there's still a missing param needed to properly isolate what I'm after, especially to make it work with N potential removals to account for.\n\nAny thoughts/feedback/known solutions?",

Let's say with five blocks, so words with length up to five.\n\nMy initial naive approach would be to order letters according to their frequency among words with five or fewer letters. The most frequent letters would be placed on different blocks. For example, lots of words have both an A and T in them, so we'd want A and T to be on different blocks. Z and X are not commonly encountered together, so would be safe to place on the same block.",

The line at first increases along both x and y. Then, it reaches a high point on the y axis and steadily decreases afterward. The result when connecting the points looks like a mountain. Is there a specific term for the line path?\n\nAlso, I realize that this might not be the best way to present data (depending on the data categories). I'm just wanting to know if a term exists for what I'm seeing.",
