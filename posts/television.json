A few decades ago, after Titanic but before Avatar, Camaron was involved in a tv series called Dark Angel. The show ran for two seasons on FOX.\n\nIt starred a young Jessica Alba, as well as Michael Weatherly, and a pre-Supernatural Jensen Ackles. Here's a summary of the show:\n\n\" Set in 2019, the series chronicles the life of [Max Guevara](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Max_Guevara) (Alba), a runaway genetically enhanced [supersoldier](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Supersoldier) who escapes from a covert military facility as a child. In a [dystopian](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dystopian) near-future [Seattle](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Seattle),  she tries to lead a normal life while eluding capture by government  agents and searching for her brothers and sisters scattered in the  aftermath of their escape. *Dark Angel* was the first and only series produced by the company Cameron\/Eglee Productions, and was filmed in Vancouver at [Lions Gate Studios](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lions_Gate_Studios). \n\nThe high-budget [pilot episode](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Television_pilot)  marked Cameron's television debut and was heavily promoted by Fox,  reaching 17.4 million viewers. The first season, which was shown on  Tuesday nights in the U.S., received mainly positive reviews and won  several awards, including the [People's Choice Award](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/People%27s_Choice_Awards)  for Favorite New TV Drama, and averaged 10.4 million viewers per  episode. Alba's portrayal of Max also received mostly positive reviews  and several awards. For the second season, the show was moved to the  less desirable air time of [Friday night](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Friday_night_death_slot)  and received some criticism for new plot elements. It suffered from a  drop in ratings, averaging 6 million viewers per episode, and was  [canceled](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cancellation_(television)). \"\n\n[https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dark\\_Angel\\_(American\\_TV\\_series)#Plot](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dark_Angel_(American_TV_series)#Plot)\n\nAnyway, Cameron himself directed the 2 hour series finale. They planned a third season, but it was never made.\n\nDoes anyone remember this show?

Every single show I just mentioned is eligible for the 75th Emmy Awards and is competing within the Outstanding Drama categories. That's not even to mention The Crown Season 5 which wasn't super well received but is usually very successful at the Emmys.\n\nThis has got to be one of the most stacked Emmy lineups ever and alot of it is spearheaded by HBO which has 4 of the shows I just mentioned, arguably 4 of the best shows out of an already impressive batch. Several networks have had stand out years in the past and gotten 2 or 3 shows within the same category nominated. But no network even with the expanded number of nominees in recent years, has gotten 4 shows competing for Outstanding Drama Series since the Golden Age of TV started in the 2000s.\n\nHaving this many nominees obviously shows they are an amazing network at the top of the field but also there is the downside that their can only be 1 winner. In the Supporting Actress and Supporting Actor categories, Jennifer Coolidge and F. Murray Abraham from White Lotus are considered favourites by some outlets and their biggest competition would be Sarah Snook and Matthew Macfayden from Succession. In the Lead Actor category, Brian Cox and Jeremy Strong from Succession already always compete with each other but now they are also against Pedro Pascal from TLOU and maybe Paddy Considine from HOTD. From HBO's perspective I worry that this is overkill and they are missing out on several wins because they are competing with themselves.\n\nThis could all actually be remedied with 1 change: Delay Succession Season 4 until the 2nd half of 2023. Succession out of all the shows mentioned is the biggest critical darling and would be the favourite regardless of what comes out in 2023\/2024, especially because it's the final season. By doing this, HBO would give The White Lotus, The Last of Us and House of the Dragon more of the spotlight and a chance to rack up big wins at this year's Emmys while Succession could still probably sweep the 2024 Emmys.","upvote_ratio":0.33,"created_utc":1678749459.0},{"title":"Outlast on Netflix","author":"meatball77","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/television\/comments\/11pabtf\/outlast_on_netflix\/","text":"This show says, what if we took Survivor and put it in Alaska and instead of being voted out you have to quit.\n\nThen they fill the cast with the most anti-social horrible people ever.\n\nYou get the worst villains I've seen on TV in years.","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1678613271.0},{"title":"The TVLine Performer of the Week: Natasha Lyonne (\"Poker Face\")","author":"DemiFiendRSA","url":"https:\/\/tvline.com\/lists\/natasha-lyonne-poker-face-performance-season-1-finale-episode-10\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1678546864.0},{"title":"BBC crisis escalates as players, stars rally behind Lineker","author":"kwentongskyblue","url":"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/lineker-bbc-british-government-asylum-migrants-tweet-30f0a905e78fdc0a3fe626aed59775e7","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1678545828.0},{"title":"Game adaptations need to chill out.","author":"bbreaddit","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/television\/comments\/11qpc2f\/game_adaptations_need_to_chill_out\/","text":"I get that tv networks are super keen on adapting every single video game into a tv series but I think it's worth remembering that these stories are not the same as novels written by authors as they were primarily supposed to be games and not stories.

That it was backup for former movie stars whose careers were  stagnating, the last spot for people who could not launch a career in film and live theatre, and the starting point for people with minimal, if no prior professional acting experience, esp children. \n\nAnd that for a long time acting on TV was so hilariously bad and that the gap with the acting of movies was very very wide. That the best TV actors were terrible if they tried feature length films or even just made for TV movies. And that the reason George Clooney was so significant to film history was that he was the first actor who came from a TV background to make it as a full time cinema actor in real Hollywood production and not just B movie roles as well as the biggest example of someone who made it to the top of the A List from the small screen............\n\nHowever someone sent me a PM in response to a post on \/r\/Buffy I participated in.\n\n>Saw your comments along with others about SMG not having a great career post-Buffy and how she attempted Hollywoods s well as comments on Boreanaz trying movies out..... So I had to send this.\n\n\n>A lot of old Telenovelas (in particular from Mexico and Argentina) had a lot of movie stars acting in them including a few A listers in the Latin America region and British TV even earlier than the Charlie's Angels day had some top actors star in it (esp since it seems in the UK there is no dividing line between TV, live theater, and cinema as there seems to be in North America)........\n\n>I mean Timothy Dalton was the leading Shakespearan actor for a time in his career (not to mention he later became James Bond!) and he gives a phenomenal performance in the 1980s Jane Eyre TV show, giving the best Rochester ever and god even relative unknowns like Anthony Higgins gives outstanding performances in various BBC roles (just go watch The Eagle of the Ninth which is available in full). Higgins and other primary TV actors have no problem getting good careers in cinema even if they did not make the A list and actually do both full time with some adding live theater in between.\n\n>Don't get me started on nationally produced TV outside of the West such as Japan's Samurai epics and the various stuff that are government sponsored in Turkey even around the same time The Brady Bunch was running. The acting is Oscar worthy and A Listers in the countries were given roles.\n\n>Even strictly TV actors in many countries where there is a big gap in quality (esp writing) have acted in serious movie roles and gave great performances even being at B and sometimes D list act and its more common before the 90s to see TV actors outside of English speaking counties to become full time movie stars or even A Listers.....\n\n>I mean did you know Salma Hayek started out in the 80s as Telenovela actress before moving onto Dusk Till Dawn when she immigrated to the USA? It seems she and her fellow co-stars on these cheap productions had no problems moving onto to cinema full time and actually dd a mix of both serious films and soap opera TV.\n\n>And indeed many Latinas who immigrated to the USA in recent years and are now popular as move stars such as Ana De La Reguera all stared as popular Telenovela stars before moving primarily to cinema in their own country just like Salma did (though they still continued acting on TV shows before immigrating to the USA as seen with La Reguera).\n\n\nI responded with a and he pointed me to an another conversation.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueFilm\/comments\/lam5cn\/do_live_action_tv_actors_in_particular_ongoing\/glqrd8y\/\n\n>I'm 37 years old and can remember when television used to show stuff from before I was born quite regularly. I'm also in the middle of watching a series from 1991 called GBH and the acting in it is quite excellent.\n\n>Every era has \"good\" and \"bad\" acting. Nonetheless, I am suggesting that proceeding on the premise that the past was bad based on literally the worst shows on television from one culture only is extremely faulty.\n\n>Your responses strike me as fairly ignorant of anything beyond your immediate context, so let me help you out. In Britain and Europe, we actually have a much longer history of producing quality television than the USA. In Germany there is Heimat, Berlin Alexanderplatz, World on a Wire, and even network shows like Tatort. Britain has had countless, including its full Shakespeare revival from 78-85 and multiple 'TV play' strands, where the best writers from theatre and television would work with the best actors and directors that would go on to fame in cinema (Loach, Greengrass, Watkins, Clarke, Leigh, Frears, Kotcheff, Apted, Joffe, Ove). Poland produced Dekalog for approximately $10k per episode and it absolutely kills anything made today on practically every level.\n\n>If you want to argue that American network television has improved in some measure then go ahead, but that doesn't speak for the world. Personally I don't see a whole lot of difference between something like The Blacklist or Chicago Med and their antecedents in network crime and hospital dramas of yore, save the superficial aspects of technologically-enhanced production, the method of shooting and the era-specific conventions in performance style. Ultimately they're soapy, kitsch, and shot according to the standard rules (30 degree rule, 180 degree rule) of television shooting.\n\nSo I really have to ask....... Richard Burton not only acted in a few American TV films but miniseries was some of the main work he did in the UK after his rocky relationship with Liz (see my username!). Despite that, he was able to easily be casted in movies anytime he auditioned and he still remained a pick for more serious roles. Acting on TV at all did not hurt his movie career (even if he was already past his prime while he was doing TV stuff). It as just seen as another day's work according to his diaries in the same way he continued live theater productions to pay the bills.\n\nSo I'd have to ask. In addition to the two quoted texts examples and Richard Burton how come America had such a gigantic divide between TV and movies and even theatre before the 2000s? While in the rest of the world since the advent of Television in their specific countries, A Listers continue doing all 3 throughout their career and TV stars transition to primarily cinema all the time and even small time TV esp on genres seen as trash like teen soap operas and action superhero monster of the week act in real  movies released in theaters and not just cheap daytime made-for-tv films and VHS B Movie releases?\n\nI mean since I got the PM as a result of chatting on \/r\/Buffy one of the lead stars of the show Anthony Head (Giles in Buffy) had done stageplays and for the bulk of his career actually acted in movies including serious roles and genres with a few TV roles back in the UK for much of his acting resume before he came to America in 1997. His actual fame in the UK is not Buffy but a few BBC shows including Doctor Who  and some local commercials.\n\nCompare that to the rest of Buffy's main cast who were small time TV extras and support or models or even outright nobodies aside from Sarah Michelle Gellar herself and maybe Seth Green for the later seasons. And except for Anthony Head, Seth Green, Dave Boreanaz and Alyson Hannigan they all practically struggled to have vibrant acting careers after Buffy (some of them like James Marsters focusing on endeavors outside of acting to continue their career elsewhere). \n\nSo I really have to ask this obsession of divide before HBO kicked off TV standards with The Sopranos? Even high budget production miniseries are not exempt from this in the pre-90s US TV industry. Aside from Peter O'Toole a lot of high budget production miniseries had to settle for full time movie actors who weren't on the A List or import British actors in. Perfect example is North and South which despite its cinema level production values settled for people who are still unknowns like James Read and had half the main cast as British actors. Even the mos famous name Patrick Swayze was seen mostly as a borderline twee B movie and proper Hollywood productions at the time.\n\nWhy did America stratify the TV and movie industry as well as stage plays? How come in the rest of the world even you have top bill local names like Toshiro Mifune  and Ana De La Reguera acting on TV alongside cinema and live stage performances?\n\nHow come TV acting was seen as something harmful to someone who is still at the early stages of his career in North American industries while for example in the UK small TV gigs and even doing full time acting on a few seasons is seen as nothing significant by itself in the UK and is done all the time by full time professional no-name movie actor swell beyond the B list and had done serious movies as well as full-time Shakespearan actors?\n\nHow come someone can do full time TV actin in a Latin American country for about yet transition to the A List no problem in not only their own country but even abroad? As seen with Salma Hayek  (i was just shy of 10 years of her entry into acting via Telenovelas when she did Dusk Till Dawn and overnight catapulted into the A List of Hollywood)? Or even smaller names like Ana De La Reguera quickly entered primarily cinema profession without much difficulty in as little as 5 years after doing nothing but TV stuff?\n\nSeeing how in the rest of the world it seems a  systematic pattern that TV actors later on become movie actors and a noteworthy amount of A listers had their start on TV as well as country's top names doing a mix of film stage plays and television, why was North America the oddjob in this, creating a real divide between TV and cinema (and cinema and live theatre as well I might add)?\n\nGeorge Clooney's successful jump to full time movie actor and making it as an AAA list actor seems less impressive when you have guys like Ricky Gervais doing feature films released in theatres and Ian Mckellan juggling in TV,Theatre, and film productions and  in at least 2 or 3 years of his career doing a mix of all 3 within a single year. So I have to ask why people jumping Clooney style to Hollywood was almost unheard off before 1995 and even today its still difficult to make the jump full time in the USA contrasted to the rest of the world?","upvote_ratio":0.31,"created_utc":1678659234.0},{"title":"\u2018New Girl\u2019 Leaving Netflix, All Episodes to Stream on Hulu and Peacock Starting April 17","author":"MarvelsGrantMan136","url":"https:\/\/variety.com\/2023\/digital\/news\/new-girl-streaming-hulu-peacock-leaving-netflix-1235549569\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1678477615.0},{"title":"Are you watching the Oscars tonight or are you going to watch the new episode of The Last Of Us?","author":"ChaingaPaste","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/television\/comments\/11pq16e\/are_you_watching_the_oscars_tonight_or_are_you\/","text":"Title basically.

And even blackmailed him to kill Rhys? What?\nFor someone that powerful, it makes no sense that he couldn't pay someone with no trace to him to do the job.

No, while I think it's underrated personally, season 2 seems to polarize people more quality wise, season 1 having the best reviews would have made more sense. All that happened is Lasso became the hottest show in the world, and AppleTV started to get better reviews, so by the time of start of season 2 more critics jumped on the bandwagon, the start of season 2 reviews capture peak Lasso good will.\n\nThen midway through season 2, it became more popular online to criticize it and call it semi annoying. For this reason, Lasso season 3 was a stone cold LOCK to get worse reviews in season 3. This is where season 2 status being revised to \"above average, but kind of too much\/annoying at times\" gets reflected. Because of confirmation bias if you go in expecting to see the half annoying Lasso you can see it. There is literally NOTHING they could have done quality wise in the first three episodes of season 3 to match that season 2 metacritic of 85, the only thing the quality would determine is low 70s or high 70s.\n\nIn an ideal world this is not how things would work, there should be a roughly 50\/50 chance of Lasso season 3 being better than season 2.

He opens shops and restaurants to give his fans a chance to be a part of the experience. Its all a lot of fun, and the sort of thing you can do when profitability isn\u2019t not a concern because you have endless piles of Top Gear Grand Tour Millionaire money chilling out in a bank account. \n\nBut then there\u2019s the other show.

Eva Green, Vincent Cassel, and Peter Mullan looked good in the trailer. But I was disappointed when the show took a U-turn. \n\nBeing a fan of spy movies and geeking out about movies and shows like Who Am I, Die Hard 4.0, Hackers, and mister Robot I was expecting this show to be about hackers, their fight with corrupt governments, or submitting everyone to anarchy. But this show is not about it at all.\n\nOne of the meanings of Liaison is a secret or an illicit sexual relationship. And now, I can see that the show is about a  connection between Eva's and Vincent's characters.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I like Eva Green. She played amazingly in Proxima, Penny Dreadful, Sin City, and Dark Shadows, but this show it's a miss for me. Showrunners have been looking for someone french-speaking and mysterious looking to fit the screenplay, and I got it.\n\nVincent Cassel is also a miss for me. I liked his performance in the Oceans and the Black Swan and tolerated him in Westworld, but now I want to skip him. He's not the super-agent mercenary type, not for my taste.\n\nThe first trailer was about someone hacking UK's infrastructure, causing chaos and a connection between Eva Green and Vincent Cassel. They share a secret and ought to work together to save the world. I was sold to see a different perspective.\n\nThe show started with a punishment. Usually, I don't watch tv shows with subtitles, but this time I had to. It might not be important to you, but it was a setback for me. \n\nRight after that, we see a hacker in an abandoned building in Damascus, aggressively typing on a keyboard. At the same time, we are introduced to the first plot device of this show - the star-shaped thumb drive that will have no meaning other than moving the plot forward.\n\nThe whole \"puss in boots\" plot got me excited for more. I was expecting the show to give me an explanation, to make a sneak peek of the hacker behind it, but nothing happened. Puss-in-boots hacker died that very second with minor remarks about it later in the show. \n\nWhy would Vincent open a safe with loads of cash in the middle of the party? Right, the plot needs him to. And now we know he is not a spy or a secret service agent because he asked about DGSE ([Directorate-General for External Security](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Directorate-General_for_External_Security)). His task is to extract the hackers and bring them to France while drunk. \n\nThe moment I saw Stanislas Merhar aka Didier Taraud I thought \"this sneaky guy is onto something\". Sad to admit that I was right. The show is doing nothing to hide it. \n\nAlso, when the show wants to be technical, they fact-check everything, as mister Robot did in all of the hacking scenes. Otherwise, they will sound technical but have no meaning. For example, when the head of the Brit's Cyber Security Office said they had a temporary backdoor into their DMZ, I laughed. A DMZ stands for \"demilitarized zone\". Its sole purpose is to add an extra layer of protection to the internal network. And it means that by getting into the DMZ you won't be able to hack the internal network and make a video play on all of their computers, but I get the theatrics. I liked that Eva was not happy in that scene. I was not happy when I heard it too.\n\nBut, I admit, seeing Eva Green playing the executive of the British government and her duo with Peter Mullan kept me entertained and somewhat invested for two episodes.\n\nWhen Eva and Vincent met somewhere in the city, I was shocked. He's a wanted man, and Eva works for the government. No one is watching after them or following them. Like what? They just told us that the government is using CCTV to track Vincent's character and Eva knows that. But meets him in the middle of London. Right, they are hidden in the trees and CCTVs are blind.\n\nHonestly, I was expecting a dynamic tv show with hackers, spies, and betrayal, but it's a spy soap in the eye of the storm type of a show. If you like soaps and drama-driven narratives, you might like Liaison.","upvote_ratio":0.55,"created_utc":1678341679.0},{"title":"Loudermilk, does Ben have a job?","author":"bc6619","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/television\/comments\/11mctjp\/loudermilk_does_ben_have_a_job\/","text":"Just started watching Loudermilk recently and find it to be very funny.

I had seen enough clips where I felt like I could pass on it since I got the gist. Also thank you Twitter and Facebook because the nerds essentially told me everything that happened before I could even watch it. Overall, I felt like I wasn't missing much. But I got bored the other day and binged the whole series. As messy as it gets towards the middle, I came from this project absolutely blown away by what I was seeing. For some background, I was born in and spent the first ten years of my life in New Jersey. Many of my friends were Pakistani, Indian, Egyptian, Moroccan etc. It was not uncommon to see hijabs and people with dots on their foreheads. I knew a few Sikh kids too. I lived where my dad actually watched the first plane hit on 9\/11. You could see the smoke from across the river. For the record, the Muslims were just as afraid as we were that day. There was no cheering to be seen. While everyday afterwards wasn't Kristalnacht it wasn't a cakewalk either. As someone who has always an interest as it concerns ethnic and religious minorities in Western media, I've kinda gotten used to how Muslims or anyone who can be seen as Muslim don't get the best wrap in media. We have seen some amazing progress in the last few years. But to me there is no greater progress than Ms. Marvel. \n\nI'm not very familiar with Kamala Khan as I've never read the comics. I've seen her pop up in some games I've played over the years but never really delved much into the character. I think also what passed me by is the significance of the character. The thing that strikes about the show, especially the first three episodes is how expertly they weave in typical high school teenager tropes we've seen ad nauseam with the unique experiences of being a Pakistani\/Desi American and a Muslim. The unique visual style in the first three episodes, goes a long way towards humanizing Kamala and making her seem like your typical American teenager first and whatever else second. I'm not Muslim nor South Asian but growing up as a gay Black teen in the Deep South, we moved after 9\/11, I definitely could relate to some of what Kamala was going through. That desire to belong to that world that's right outside but you are steady being pulled back by culture and tradition is something I think of any background can relate to. \n\nThe first three episodes easily could have been their own movie and I would've been satisfied. Kamala's parents, her friends and her community felt wholly relatable to me. There were a few times where I tried to imagine a version of this story that took place in suburban Ohio with a blonde white girl and I honestly could. But yet here we are focusing on a Pakistani American Muslim girl from Jersey City. The show goes to great lengths to emphasize Kamala's Americanness and how she's a merging of both sides. I have never seen this done so expertly in Western media before and for it to come from Disney of all places is absolutely shocking. The corporation doesn't have the greatest reputation when it comes to portraying non-European cultures, especially Asian ones. So for this project to be as good as it is feels like an accomplishment to me. It does break a lot of stereotypes that we've gotten used to by now. The female characters do not treat the hijab or their faith as something confining that they need to be liberated from. In fact, it is outright said in the first episode that Nakia chose to wear the hijab. Islam is not portrayed as any more stringent or restrictive than other faiths. The characters aren't portrayed as hyper religious. Obviously their faith means a lot to them but it's not overdone. We get to see through the many side characters how these are very much normal people where the only difference is the faith they practice. The male characters are largely encouraging of the female characters pursuing their dreams and goals. \n\nI feel like I'm the only one who likes episodes 4 and 5 and I don't disagree that they're uneven. I don't disagree that the villains are about as bad as The Flag Smashers. But there is a lot in those two episodes I really liked. The first half of episode 5 felt like we were in a different show entirely and I didn't mind that all too much. The acting in this first half is outright some of the best acting we've gotten in an MCU project thus far. When the Marvel elements crept back in to rear it's ugly head it wasn't as jarring as I thought it would be. The death of the villains was kinda dumb but luckily it lead to some good shit later on. I very much felt like the Partition of India was something that they had in mind first and then tried to figure out a way to tie it into the rest of the show. For the most part, I think it worked. I also saw what they were trying to do with the Clandestines. The concept of two worlds sharing a border yet one side threatening to overtake and erase that world seems like it could be thematically relevant to cultural themes we've been exploring. I just don't think they were cooked well enough. The motivations given don't entirely make sense and I'm not sure why the villains actually died and I watched this episode twice. I do think this could have been done better. What saves the show for me from being The Falcon and the Winter Soldier levels of bad is that the characters and the visual style are so strong. The unique visual style does come back towards the end. Kamala is a very well written character throughout the show. The exploration of Pakistani culture kept things very interesting for me as well. Thus far when Marvel tries to make something culturally specific yet connected to this larger fantastical universe, it works for me so much better than any of the Ant Man movies or something like Hawkeye and Black Widow. The best projects so far have been Black Panther 1 and 2, Shang-Chi and Ms. Marvel. I haven't seen Moon Knight yet.  I'm very much looking forward to what they do with Echo, Wonder Man, Blade and Nova if the latter two ever get off the ground. \n\nThis feels like one of the more pure translations from comic to screen that we've seen in a way, especially as it concerns the portrayal of the main character. Finally so much of what I felt has been lost in translation with this character has been communicated thoroughly. I hope whatever Pakistani or Bangladeshi or Muslim girl who sees this feels empowered by seeing a superhero who looks like her. This show really sold me on the concept of Kamala Khan and I can't wait to see her in The Marvels. I'd give the show a 7\/10. What it gets right it really gets right.","upvote_ratio":0.33,"created_utc":1678383856.0},{"title":"\u2018Yellowstone\u2019 Effect: Streamers Eager to Hitch a Ride West on the Back of Hit Series - Execs at both linear networks and streaming services have put out the word that they\u2019re all looking to cash in on the success of the Kevin Costner-starring Paramount Network series","author":"Neo2199","url":"https:\/\/www.hollywoodreporter.com\/tv\/tv-news\/yellowstone-westerns-netflix-amazon-1235342699\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.71,"created_utc":1678227860.0},{"title":"Hiroki Totoki, Sony CFO: Without a Streaming Platform, We\u2019re Free to Sell Films and Shows \u201cto the Highest Bidder\u201d","author":"HumanOrAlien","url":"https:\/\/www.hollywoodreporter.com\/business\/business-news\/sony-cfo-streaming-film-tv-1235342065\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1678201105.0},{"title":"Jason Sudeikis Says \u2018Ted Lasso\u2019 Season 3 \u201cIs The End Of This Story We Wanted To Tell\u201d; Addresses Potential Spinoffs","author":"SanderSo47","url":"https:\/\/deadline.com\/2023\/03\/jason-sudeikis-ted-lasso-season-3-spoilers-series-finale-spinoffs-1235280998\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1678150366.0},{"title":"The Looney Tunes Show (2011) deserves more praise","author":"Hi_Im_zack","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/television\/comments\/11l3ufz\/the_looney_tunes_show_2011_deserves_more_praise\/","text":"For folks who don't know, it was Looney Tunes with a modern and mature outlook, The episodes were very grounded and dialogue heavy.

I was honestly baffled at how relatable that was, coming from fucking Looney Tunes? Whaat. \n\nI later watched more and found out that the whole show was like this, from annoying roommates to awkward dates, and dealing with unemployment, The show asks \"what if these wacky characters actually lived in the real world?\" and it did a marvelous job of answering it. The jokes landed extremely well, and I'm amazed at how not a single one of those iconic characters felt out of place in a modern setting.\n\nReally sad that it got canceled, according to Google, the higher-ups at Warner hated it.

I think a revival is probably out of the question as the show's cult fan base is too small, but Bruce has an idea for a revival.\n\nHere's what he had to say during a [recent interview](https:\/\/www.slashfilm.com\/1217245\/bruce-campbell-on-the-future-of-pizza-poppa-evil-dead-rise-and-his-upcoming-tour-exclusive-interview\/):\n\n>\"The Adventures of Brisco County\" is ... you would bring him back following the death of Lord Bowler to find out who killed Lord Bowler, and you have potentially a Brisco son with Dixie that we don't know about, and maybe a Bowler's son that we don't know about, and maybe those guys team up. With me being a successful San Francisco lawyer, maybe he's got to saddle up again at some point. But you'd have to take a new spin on the whole thing, but I'd be all over that like a cheap suit.\"\n\nI think this is a cool idea as family was a core theme of the original series. Bruce has been open about not being able to perform physically taxing roles as much as he used to, but playing a wise old lawyer would suit him at this stage of his career. The original series was also a revenge series that took some strange detours, so Bruce's idea lends itself to that formula too.\n\nIt'll never happening, but it's a nice dream.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1678171231.0},{"title":"'History of the World Part II' guest star Johnny Knoxville reveals how it compared to an actual 'Jackass' shoot and more.","author":"Sisiwakanamaru","url":"https:\/\/ew.com\/tv\/history-of-the-world-part-ii-johnny-knoxville-rasputin\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1678181525.0},{"title":"The Resident Renewal Hopes Dim","author":"verissimoallan","url":"https:\/\/tvline.com\/2023\/03\/07\/the-resident-cancelled-prop-sale-season-7-fox\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.71,"created_utc":1678205205.0},{"title":"'How I Met Your Father' Flashes Back to Hilary Duff's 'Lizzie McGuire' Past","author":"Sisiwakanamaru","url":"https:\/\/www.tvinsider.com\/1084237\/how-i-met-your-father-sophie-past-lizzie-mcguire-footage\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.74,"created_utc":1678196691.0},{"title":"History of the World Part II.

As a viewer, you end up as invested in the detectives as the mysteries. \n\nSeason 5 is currently airing, but it is serialised - you have to start at S1.  \n\nAlso, those of you who have binged S5, what did you think? Spoiler-free. I loved this season, thought the mystery was the most compelling for a while. Sinead Keenan was an excellent addition to the cast.","upvote_ratio":0.74,"created_utc":1678136705.0},{"title":"\u2018Citadel\u2019: Amazon\u2019s Big Bet for a Global TV Franchise","author":"Mynameis__--__","url":"https:\/\/www.vanityfair.com\/hollywood\/2023\/02\/awards-insider-citadel-first-look","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.58,"created_utc":1678151704.0},{"title":"How Succession, Billions and Other Rich TV Shows Get the Details Right","author":"lordatlas","url":"https:\/\/robbreport.com\/lifestyle\/news\/succession-billions-details-1234808621\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.66,"created_utc":1678118381.0},{"title":"The Rumored \u2018Vanderpump Rules\u2019 Affair, Explained","author":"themimeofthemollies","url":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2023\/03\/06\/style\/vanderpump-rules-cheating-explainer.html","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.45,"created_utc":1678215643.0},{"title":"ABC Readies \u2018Motherland\u2019 Pilot With Ellie Kemper In Talks & Karan Soni Set To Star; Michael Showalter To Direct, Paul Feig To EP Adaptation Of UK Format","author":"Single_Detective_667","url":"https:\/\/deadline.com\/2023\/03\/motherland-abc-pilot-ellie-kemper-karan-soni-michael-showalter-paul-feig-uk-format-1235280615\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1678145834.0},{"title":"Episode 9 Preview | The Last of Us | HBO Max","author":"SadKnowledge2","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/G0EN4S4nNnw","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1678072568.0},{"title":"Doctor Who was almost cancelled says Chris Chibnall","author":"Zepanda66","url":"https:\/\/www.southwalesargus.co.uk\/news\/national\/uk-today\/23363809.bbc-doctor-almost-cancelled-says-chris-chibnall\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1678047572.0},{"title":"Nick Cannon Announces Game Show to Find Out 'Who's Having My Baby'","author":"kwentongskyblue","url":"https:\/\/www.etonline.com\/nick-cannon-announces-game-show-to-find-out-whos-having-my-baby-200408","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.44,"created_utc":1678232654.0},{"title":"Peak TV Is Over.

What came as a surprise though, was several comments saying things along the lines of \"sure, it's not supposed to be *Jeopardy!*\" which gave the impression that *Jeopardy!* is seen as a fairly high-minded quiz show.\n\nI'm not dissing *Jeopardy!* for a second (the concept sounds great, clips I've seen are entertaining, and I've often wondered why we've not imported a version over here) but whilst it's clearly no game for mugs, it's never struck me as a massively 'intellectual' show exactly, from what I've seen.\n\nThe comparison that comes instantly to mind is the BBC's *University Challenge*, which is the kind of quiz that has most of us feeling very pleased with ourselves if we get more than a handful of the answers right. It covers all sorts of topics, but not much in the way of 'popular culture', and it's *hard*. I mean, honestly, sometimes it's enough of a challenge just to understand the *question*. It has a real cult following over here though, and tends to dominate the UK's twitter trending whilst it's airing live.\n\nSo, in this age of global media, I was wondering if people in the USA were aware of it, if many people watch it even - and if so, what you make of it?","upvote_ratio":0.64,"created_utc":1678119669.0},{"title":"Rewatching X-Files, S11E04","author":"charlfourie","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/television\/comments\/11k2w9q\/rewatching_xfiles_s11e04\/","text":"I've been rewatching the whole series and Season 11's The Lost Art of Forehead Sweat has to be one of the best episodes in the entire series.

(That's when Lee Pace isn't firing on all cylinders, of course).\n\nI love how the character is continually evolving as well. In the first season, Gordon was in a very dark place, like he was numb to the world. Then he grew in confidence. Plus there's the ongoing health cares and crisis of confidence. \n\nMcNairy is also just so damn likeable and endearing in the role. His subtle delivery brings about so many laugh out loud moments. >!(My favourite part is when he's reading a magazine about the virus he accidentally created and he's like 'jeez, this is my legacy, they even named it too' - had me rolling)!<\n\nA fully realised character. It's crazy he never got any awards or accolades.\n\nThe funniest thing for me is, the only other role I've seen McNairy in was briefly at the end of Narcos: Mexico season 1 where he appears to be playing a completely different character, some hench macho gun crazy guy.

Is there currently any show about that? I wrote a short version of the idea. \n\nThe Premise goes something like this:\nSelf-defense classes are often advertised as the key to personal safety and security, but how effective are they really? To answer this question, we've enlisted the help of a group of skilled Muay Thai students who will attend local self-defense classes and put them to the test.\n\nEach episode will focus on a different self-defense class, with our team of Muay Thai students attending as undercover trainees. The self-defense students and teachers will be unaware of the true purpose of their attendance, believing that they are just regular students looking to improve their self-defense skills.\n\nAs the classes progress, our team of medium skilled Muay Thai students will begin to test the effectiveness of the techniques being taught, engaging in sparring and simulated attacks to see how well the students and instructors can defend themselves. Along the way, we'll get to know the self-defense students and teachers, learning about their backgrounds and motivations for pursuing self-defense training.\n\nBut the real question is, will the self-defense classes stand up to the stress test? Will their techniques be able to repel the attacks of medium-skilled Muay Thai practitioners? And what will happen when the self-defense students and teachers find out the true nature of the show?\n\nEpisodes:\n\n\"Krav Maga\" - Our team attends a Krav Maga class, where they learn techniques designed for real-world self-defense scenarios. But will these techniques hold up under the pressure of a skilled Muay Thai attack?\n\n\"Women's Self-Defense\" - This episode focuses on a self-defense class specifically designed for women.

Canada's Cartoon Network","author":"Intelligent-Lack-122","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/television\/comments\/11erbj0\/a_look_back_at_teletoon_canadas_cartoon_network\/","text":"So, I heard the news that at the end of March. Teletoon a channel that has been with Canada for 25 years, is shutting down and will be rebranded into Cartoon Network.\n\nThis is big for a lot of kids who grew up in the 90s, 2000s, and 2010s. If your a Canadian, Teletoon was our Cartoon Network. So, I'd thought I would take a trip down memory lane, with the history of Teletoon, and the shows that stand out to me.\n\n**In The Beginning:**\n\nTeletoon first launched in Canada in 1997, like Cartoon Network it was a channel dedicated to cartoons and animation all over the world. Teletoon also had it's own original shows such as *Ned's Newt, Pippi Longstocking, the Triplets,* a show based on *Donkey Kong Country,* among others.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere were program blocks dedicated to different demographic.\n\n\\-Morning Planet for Preschoolers with shows like *Magic School Bus.*\n\n\\-Afternoon Planet for Kids with shows like *Scooby Doo.*\n\n\\-Evening Planet for Family with shows like *Donkey Kong Country.*\n\n\\-and Night Planet for Adult with shows like *Duckman.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne of the first shows I remember seeing was the classic Scooby Doo series. But the show that got me hooked on the channel were reruns of *Fireball XL5.* Aired in 1962 and was from the creator of Thunderbirds, Gerry Anderson. It was the show I would watch during lunchtime, and my favorite part of the show was the theme song at the end of each episode. While other 90s kids were singing  Hakuna Matata, I was singing the Fireball theme song.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther shows that stand out to me were\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Voltron: The Third Dimension.*\n\nI didn't grow up with the original show, because obviously I wasn't born in the 80s. But to me, this was Voltron. Sure the CGI is a little outdated, but it's still an underrated show. Also, Tim Curry as Lotor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe earlier seasons of *The Simpsons.*\n\nThis channel was my introduction to The Simpsons from the classic era. Yes the more recent seasons are shit, but seasons 1-9 still hold up. Ok, not so much Season 1. But those were the seasons that played on Teletoon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Ace Ventura The Animated Series.*\n\nDespite knowing about it, I didn't really watch it as a kid. It wasn't until I got the boxset that came with the 2 movies, and a bonus disc which was 3 episodes of the cartoon. A must watch if your a fan of the movies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Cybersix.*\n\nA short-lived animated superhero series, that dealt with mature themes and subject matter for a kids show. it was about a female android battles her evil creator's forces as a mysterious superhero.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Ned's Newt.*\n\nA show about a kid named Ned and his pet newt named Newton, who grows 6 feet tall, and who is very similar to the Genie from Aladdin. It was one of their first, and one of their funniest. The voice of Newton was done by comedian Harland Williams.\n\nThe channel was the main hub for Cartoon Network shows. *Johnny Bravo, Cow and Chicken, Courage the Cowardly Dog* among others. As well as classic Hanna-Barbera shows. *Scooby Doo, Jetsons, Flintstones, Josie and the Pussycats, Wacky Racers.* Etc. And classic Looney Tunes shows like *Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show, and The Road Runner Show.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut my favorite was *Ed, Edd, and Eddy.*\n\nIt's a good example of a show with wacky comedy and stupid characters. But can still be funny and well written.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere were shows that I liked as a kid such as *Angela Anaconda, Donkey Kong Country, and Archie's Weird Mysteries.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nArchie's Weird Mysteries was my first exposure to Archie.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI played Donkey Kong Country on the Super Nintendo growing up, and of course I saw the TV show. But GOD the characters look unnatural in the series.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAngela Anaconda was a really odd show about the spice of life stories of a girl named Angela and her friends. Why is it odd? Well the animation is like Monty Python mixed with real faces.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSadly, these shows don't hold up well as an adult.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther shows were *Mega Babies*......We don't talk about that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere was one show called *Redwall*, about mouses defending their home against rats. Yeah it's been awhile since I saw it, and my memory is very vague.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother show I vaguely remember was Captain Star, which was like Star Trek. That's all I know and one of the characters was voiced by Ade Edmondson (Young Ones and Bottom).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I do remember the *Ghostbusters Animated Series and Tales from the Cryptkeeper.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTeletoon also showed Animated movies every Saturday night called *Cinetoon*. There were also bumpers with shorts in-between shows. One of being them *Jean-Luc & Dondoozat*. Teletoon was one of many channels that showed the PSAs for Concerned Children's Advertisers. There were even Teletoon documentaries that go behind the scenes on how different animation styles are done, this was Splat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe late 90s were the golden years for Teletoon in my opinion.\n\n**The 2000s:**\n\nIn the early 2000s, the channel went through some changes. The Simpsons moved to the Comedy Network, and some of the original shows were not worth writing home about. You had *Braceface and Totally Spies,* but I was not the target audience for those shows. So, no comment. There was For *Better or Worse* based on the newspaper comic. *What's With Andy*, a show about a kid who courses pranks all over his city, and gets in trouble by the end. Rinse and repeat. There was *My Dad The Rockstar*, a show created by Kiss member Gene Simmons.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut reruns of shows like Cybersix and Ned's Newt still ran on the channel. The program blocks were nonexistent anymore. Instead new blocks came in, one of them being Teletoon Retro. Which was the block for older cartoons like the *60s Spider-Man and Rocket Robin Hood.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEventually the block branch out into its own channel, and would last until 2015. Along with classic Hanna Barbera and Looney Tunes. Reruns of shows like *Reboot, Gumby, Transformers, G.I Joe and even the Adam West's Batman show* played on Teletoon Retro. And here's a fun fact, I wrote a letter to Teletoon asking for certain shows to be shown on Teletoon Retro. Two I requested actually made it to the channel. And those shows were *Batman: The Animated Series and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe early 2000s had the Detour later renamed Teletoon at Night, which was the Canadian equivalent to Adult Swim. That block introduced me and others to shows like *Futurama, and Family Guy.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKids WB shows like *What's New Scooby Doo?* and 2004s *The Batman* made there way to Teletoon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe early 2000s was would I like to call the silver age of Teletoon. Everything looked like it was on the right track.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut you know what they say, what goes up must come down.\n\n**The start of downfall:**\n\nFor me the beginning of the downfall would start around late 2004 and 2005. All starting with *6teen*. I'll try not to step on too many toes, because the show has it's fans. For the time, it was popular in Canada, even I was watching it at 13. But I'm sorry 6teen has aged poorly. the animation isn't good, and the characters were either annoying or unlikeable. It also didn't help that Cartoon Network was going through a similar downfall. Replacing almost of their classic shows, with less then amazing series.\n\n**The worst era:**\n\nThe next 5 years can be describe into two simple words.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLaziness and Simplicity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe mid to late 2000s is what I call the dark years of Teletoon, especially around 2007\/2008. Most of the shows from them and Cartoon Network during the period consist of simple generic stories and writing. Cheap lazy gross out humor and slapstick. Sometimes really bad flash animation. It was pretty clear their newer shows during the mornings and evenings stopped trying to be clever and well written shows for all ages, and instead pander to the tween crowd and really younger kids.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt best shows like *Delilah and Juilius, Carl2, and Wayside* were mediocre.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt worst shows like *the George of The Jungle remake, Johnny Test, and Zeroman* were awful. They were the equivalent of jingling keys in front of a kids face.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut not everything was terrible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne show during that era would go on to be the most popular show Teletoon has ever produced. And that of course was *Total Drama Island.* From the creators of 6teen,the show was a parody of reality shows like survivor, featuring 22 teens at a summer camp, who get voted off one by one each episode. The last one standing wins 1 million dollars. When it premiered it was praised by critics and fans, and I have to admit the first season is one of my favorite shows. Why did I like this when I disliked 6teen and the other shows during that time? Well, this series has more interesting and diverse cast of characters, jokes were that actually funny at times, better animation by flash standards. Each character and plotline served its purpose, and didn't overstay it's welcome. Season 1 was the peak of Total Drama, but after that it slowly went downhill. Cartoon Network bought the rights to broadcast Total Drama in the states, and they started meddling with the production. Apparently in the later seasons *Action and World Tour.* Certain storylines and decisions like couples breaking up were not the creators idea, CN told them to do it.\n\nThe fourth season, *Revenge of the Island* was decent. But I gave up on the show after that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother show from the creators of 6teen and Total Drama was *Stoked*. Which was basically 6teen but at a hotel resort. It didn't last long.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere was a block dedicated to Superhero cartoons like *Spectacular Spider-Man, Young Justice, Batman Brave and The Bold, and later on Beware the Batman.*  But the block eventually faded away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust like CN, Teletoon started making their own live action shows during that period. One of them called *My Babysitter's a Vampire.* I don't think anyone remembers or has seen that show. I know I didn't.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTeletoon at Night was the main hub for *Robot Chicken,* as well as reruns of Family Guy, American Dad, and Futurama. There were 2 original shows from Teletoon called *Dating Guy and Crash Canyon.* I admit watching at 18 and liking them. But they weren't that good. Later came a show called Fugget about it, which was just plain bad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe whole network was just the 6teen\/Total Drama channel, and things felt like they were getting worse and worse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, things would slowly start to get better around the 2010s.\n\n**The modern era:**\n\nCut to the mid 2010s to present day. Teletoon would air programs such as *Adventure Time, Steven Universe, and Infinity Train.* All shows that got critical acclaimed for their writing and characters. Along with *Justice League Action,* which is a criminally underrated show. When Young Justice was revived on DC Universe\/HBO Max. Teletoon would aired season 3 and 4 in Canada. While Nickelodeon would air new seasons of Power Rangers in the states. Teletoon would be the home for Power Rangers in Canada from *Megaforce to Dino Fury.* Teletoon at Night was also the main network for *Archer* as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese shows help the network get back on their feet and make it much better then it was back in the late 2000s. Sure, shows like *Teen Titans Go* wasn't the greatest. But it tried harder then George of the Jungle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes this mean Teletoon was back to the standards it was in their heyday?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes and No.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKeep in mind all the shows I've mention were either Cartoon Network or another company. Recent shows made by Teletoon still weren't good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* *Rocket Monkeys.*\n* *My Butt went Psycho.*\n* *Total Dramarama.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, Cartoon Network now has it's own channel in Canada, with all their shows being available to watch there. Adult Swim had it's own Network in Canada as well. At the start of 2019 Teletoon at Night shutdown, and all the cartoons from that block moved to Adult Swim. It's now the home for *Archer, Rick and Morty, and Harley Quinn The Animated Series.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNetflix in the US and Canada is the new home for Power Rangers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow most of the shows are reruns of CN and Teletoon shows from the 2010s, Batman The Animated Series, Superman, Justice League, and Young Justice.\n\nIt was clear by 2022 that Teletoon's best years were behind them. The last shows I watched on the network was *Adventure Time: Distant Island* back in 2020 and the last season of Young Justice last summer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd on March 27, 2023 Teletoon will be gone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf they were to try to recapture their golden years or Teletoon Retro now during the streaming era, it wouldn't be a smart move.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost of the shows from the 90s\/2000s that I've mentioned can be streamed on Tubi, YouTube, or Shout Factory TV for free. The Simpsons are owned by Disney now, and it can be streamed on Disney+. Also, the kids who grew up on Teletoon in the 90s and 2000s are now adults and have moved on to other things in their lives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't be sad that Teletoon is going, be glad it happened.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In an Nutshell:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe late 90s were the golden years: Some shows like Donkey Kong and Angela Anaconda have aged like milk. But we got shows like Ned's Newt, Ed Edd Eddy, Voltron 3D, Ace Ventura, and Cybersix. As well as reruns of The Simpsons and Fireball XL5.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe early 2000s was the silver age: While their original shows were meh. It was the main home for Family Guy, Futurama, The Batman, among others.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe late 2000s was the worst time for Teletoon: There were times when they brought out something good like Total Drama Island. But those moments were rare.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe mid 2010s to Present day was much better, at least when it came to Cartoon Network shows, original shows not so much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope you enjoy this lookback on Teletoon. Canada's Cartoon Network for 25 years. What was your favorite show from this channel? Let me know in the comments.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>***\"What about Caillou? That was one of Teletoon's first shows\"***\n\nThat show doesn't exist. it never happened, it never happened.","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1677636812.0},{"title":"Former Pres Was So Upset by

television.","author":"forman98","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/television\/comments\/11e8do9\/supernatural_seasons_15_are_extremely_good\/","text":"I recently finished a rewatch of Supernatural's first 5 seasons for the first time in about a decade. I picked up on the show around 2010, right when season 5 was airing and binged it all on Netflix at that point in time. \n\nI've watched seasons 6-15 and having now rewatched the first 5 seasons again, I can't believe what a steaming pile of crap the rest of the series ended up being. \n\nKripke's treatment through the first 5 seasons is consistent and coherent and builds to an appropriate climax. Those seasons tend to naturally break up into 3 buckets; Seasons 1-2, Season 3, and Seasons 4-5. \n\nThe first two seasons have a certain aesthetic that was never really recaptured in the rest of the series. They were still riding on the dark and grungy look of the early 2000's horror movies. Grey filters, night settings, rain. They did a really good job of shooting horror on a budget with mostly practical effects and camera tricks. The story line through those first 44 episodes wraps up somewhat nicely in the final episode of season 2 where they finally confront the yellow-eyed demon. I know Kripke somewhat wrote that as a close in case they never got picked up again. \n\nSeason 3 was shortened to 16 episodes due to the writer's strike, but looking back it seems the shorter season was a good thing. Many great shows are now producing fewer episodes with higher quality. This season didn't really move the overall plot forward much because it all ended up being for naught; Dean couldn't get out of the demon deal he made in season 2. \n\nSeason 4-5 are the first real departure from the Monster of the Week style that the show had been. People have mixed feelings about this departure, but I think the overall story makes up for that. This is when angels are introduced and the Winchesters find out about their true destinies. They harp on the symmetry between Sam\/Dean and Lucifer\/Michael and their absent fathers quite a bit. They string along the final battle throughout the last season and don't hint at the possible conclusion until the last couple episodes. The conclusion is very tragic, but very fitting to what they all went through over those 5 seasons. \n\nOverall, it's 126 episodes of interesting TV with only a handful of duds. Sam and Dean are consistently the best part of every episode. It's often the side characters or the plots that make something meh. \n\nI write all of this to highlight just how far the show fell after season 5. It ended up being a complete flip. Seasons 6-15 had a handful of really good episodes with a bunch of meh. Nothing made sense anymore, the canon and lore was progressively tossed out, and the campy side characters started taking center stage. Most of those characters worked in small doses, but they would consistently show up. So much of those seasons were cringy fanservice. The overall season plots were flimsy and rarely lead anywhere substantial. Sam and Dean just seemed to be there dealing with it instead of actually *part* of the story. The writers kept killing and bringing back people just to highlight how much pain the Winchesters have to endure. Sam and Dean would constantly go back and forth lying to each other and betraying each other. And ultimately the series ends on a dud. So much of a dud that it caused a lot of controversy in the fandom (who had already been heavily catered to for a decade). \n\nThe first 5 seasons work too well as a contained series and the remaining 10 seasons just served to taint that. If the show were to ever comeback in some form, I would only want Kripke to come back and begin with an alternate season 6 that ignores 6-15. Pick up with Dean 20 years in the future and Sam having been gone the whole time. I'm sure there's a good story out there, but for now I'll just keep rewatching 1-5 and skipping the rest.","upvote_ratio":0.82,"created_utc":1677594728.0},{"title":"Hasan Minhaj Tells Elon He's Out, Deletes Twitter Account On-Air | The Daily Show","author":"ineededanameagain","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=W9KjWvMhPNs","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.46,"created_utc":1677755779.0},{"title":"Waco: The Aftermath (2023) Official Trailer | SHOWTIME | April 14th","author":"indig0sixalpha","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FYjXrMp_ElM","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1677618214.0},{"title":"As AI Comes Into Focus With Rise Of ChatGPT, WGA Seeks To Protect Writers From Robots","author":"Neo2199","url":"https:\/\/deadline.com\/2023\/02\/articificial-intelligence-chatgpt-wga-writers-1235273803\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1677604310.0},{"title":"\u2018The Mandalorian\u2019 Season Three Gets Off to a Disappointing Start","author":"verissimoallan","url":"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/tv-movies\/tv-movie-recaps\/the-mandalorian-season-3-premiere-disappointing-pedro-pascal-grogu-disney-plus-1234682972\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.48,"created_utc":1677737025.0},{"title":"Up Here | Official Trailer | Hulu (March 24)","author":"LineLiar","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=crhL1eOjf4U","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.71,"created_utc":1677617999.0},{"title":"In Hollywood Contract Talks, the Push for Viewership Data May Become a Flash Point","author":"Neo2199","url":"https:\/\/variety.com\/2023\/biz\/news\/wga-negotiations-viewership-data-streamers-netflix-apple-1235538967\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.69,"created_utc":1677635262.0},{"title":"Dead Ringers - Teaser | Prime Video | April 21st","author":"indig0sixalpha","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=smRrEqRShsc","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1677615231.0},{"title":"Netflix Top 10: 'Outer Banks' Season 3 Sails to No. 1 With Over 154 Million Hours Viewed","author":"Luis_Ignacio","url":"https:\/\/variety.com\/2023\/tv\/news\/outer-banks-season-3-154-million-hours-viewed-first-four-days-1235538681\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.69,"created_utc":1677616083.0},{"title":"Amazon Studios Boss Jennifer Salke Unfazed by Warner Bros.

Going through my collection I came across the Blu Ray copy of S4 of GOT, which is the only GOT-related physical media I own. I'd never had the urge of watching it since the show ended but for some reason I thought why not just try it and see how well it has aged.\n\nSo I only watched GOT S4 this past week and that season of television is something else. Absolutely incredible from start to end. Of course that excellent buildup from the past 3 seasons helps but still S4 rises the highest among GOT seasons. Post S4 the writing starts to decline as the source material isn't either there or isn't followed too closely. And while seasons 1-3 are great in their own right, Seasons 1 and 2 have noticeably weak production design. \n\nSeason 3 is right next to S4 since both cover the best book of ASOIAF called Strom of Swords, but S4 just has much more drama. S4 is packed with tension, betrayals, unexpected deaths of heroes as well as villains, tragedy, love, battles, duels, courtroom drama, politics & dying on the shitter.\n\nS4 is the season of the Lannisters who easily have the best actors and the most complex villains in Joffrey, Tywin & Cersei. Tyrion gets our sympathy as he navigates a way out of the mess he gets into after the Purple Wedding with a fan favorite supporting act from Pedro pascal's Oberyn Martell. \n\nThe run of the final 5 episodes has banger after banger, each better than the last: The Laws of gods and men, Mockingbird, Mountain and the Viper, Watchers on the Wall & The Children.\n\nThe Watchers on the Wall is the special episode of the season (EP 9) as it's all set in one location and features probably the most well thought out battle of the show. From Pyp and Grenn's emotional deaths, Sam showing character, Alisser Thorne being a hard badass, Ygritte's sad death to Jon Snow finally taking a long awaited charge and running the show, Watchers is a masterpiece.\n\nAdding very good production\/set design, cinematography, score & editing to the story, characters and acting, you get a stunning season of Television that can stand against the best of them imho.\n\n**My rating: 10\/10**","upvote_ratio":0.62,"created_utc":1677310217.0},{"title":"Why does everyone HATE Better Call Saul?","author":"_ShigeruTarantino_","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/television\/comments\/11d8obb\/why_does_everyone_hate_better_call_saul\/","text":"The show can't win a single award.\n\nWhy do you think that is?\n\nEveryone seems to HATE Better Call Saul\n\nEveryone, everywhere, all at once lol\n\nEdit: Everyone ignores it BECAUSE they HATE IT lol","upvote_ratio":0.06,"created_utc":1677493901.0},{"title":"SNL YouTube Highlights 2-25-23","author":"Amazing-Scallion7162","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/television\/comments\/11cjmqu\/snl_youtube_highlights_22523\/","text":"Last post removed for vague title.\n\n\n[Cold Open](https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=HX1RdzYVjDo)\n\n[1st Sketch](https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=nlKXYzYqxXY)\n\n[2nd Sketch](https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=SLRIUeNX7pk)\n\n[3rd Sketch](https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=o4rJqydSZ08)\n\n[4th Sketch](https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=OODWzbaI3eI)\n\n[Musical Guest 1](https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=OHp_h7RLfAU)\n\n[Musical Guest 2](https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=BJUDoB0errI)\n\n[Weekend Update 1](https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=OXq0rM_1VHk)\n\n[Weekend Update 2](https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=kRgdj6SfZZY)\n\n[Weekend Update 3](https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=r0wyqVRK3vM)\n\n[Weekend Update 4](https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=dBOeWFtV2o4)\n\n[Digital Short](https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=6v7vPRyJHuM)\n\n[Sketch 5](https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=HtJ70buqmHU)\n\n[Sketch 6](https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=Mu12X2cu6Y0)","upvote_ratio":0.44,"created_utc":1677424573.0},{"title":"\u2018Luther: The Fallen Sun\u2019 Review: Idris Elba\u2019s Troubled Detective Gets a Satisfactory Screen Treatment","author":"fdjadjgowjoejow","url":"https:\/\/www.hollywoodreporter.com\/movies\/movie-reviews\/luther-the-fallen-sun-review-idris-elba-1235331707","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1677278357.0},{"title":"\u2018The Santa Clauses\u2019: Eric Stonestreet Cast as \u2018Mad Santa\u2019 in Season 2","author":"klutzysunshine","url":"https:\/\/tvline.com\/2023\/02\/24\/the-santa-clauses-eric-stonestreet-cast-mad-santa-season-2\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1677261719.0},{"title":"BoJack Horseman, I'm glad I knew you, too.","author":"kea32","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/rCN238ht6gw","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1677303490.0},{"title":"\"The Swarm\" (Der Schwarm) | Trailer | Berlinale 2023","author":"messengers1","url":"https:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=6SqufBzChsw&feature=share","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.79,"created_utc":1677293005.0},{"title":"\u2018Succession\u2019 Ending With Season 4 on HBO","author":"MarvelsGrantMan136","url":"https:\/\/www.hollywoodreporter.com\/tv\/tv-news\/succession-ending-with-season-4-on-hbo-1235333216\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1677202493.0},{"title":"Behind The Sketch: Mario Kart Trailer - SNL","author":"Dux-El52","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TNNFUr4wDLM","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.72,"created_utc":1677279742.0},{"title":"DC\u2019s \u2018Dead Boy Detectives\u2019 Moves from HBO Max to Netflix","author":"klutzysunshine","url":"https:\/\/www.hollywoodreporter.com\/tv\/tv-news\/dead-boy-detectives-moves-netflix-from-hbo-max-1235318785\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1677264695.0},{"title":"What is the difference between Critics and \u201cthe industry\u201d ??","author":"ackchanticleer","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/television\/comments\/11cglu5\/what_is_the_difference_between_critics_and_the\/","text":"Some entertainment opinion guy was talking about how the TV critics love Bob Odenkirk and the awards he has won have been critic awards but \u201cthe industry\u201d won\u2019t give Bob any respect.

If it\u2019s just jokes, jokes, jokes, then I think it\u2019s harder to connect and relate to the heart and soul of the character delivering them.\n\nThe Office has many examples of this but one is when in the season 4 episode \u201cMoney\u201d Michael Scott is very tired, dejected and lacking focus and it\u2019s just a very different Michael Scott and Steve Carell depicts this very well and the conversations seem even more natural and the episode as a whole has less hijinks than usual (aside from Mose Schrute, mainly) and I feel Steve had to carry it more on the dramatic acting side than usual and I felt for Michael and the predicament he and Dwight was in that episode, who, by the way, also shined in that episode.\n\nDr. Cox\u2019s best friend Ben (played by Brendan Fraser) had a very gut-wrenching three episodes in Scrubs and in My Screw Up in particular was very moving and if that doesn\u2019t make you tear up at least a little, you\u2019re a heartless, soulless monster. \u201cWhere do you think we are?\u201d\n\nWill\u2019s father abandoning him again on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air I thought was another very good example of dramatic acting by Will and James, especially in that last scene of that episode. \"How come he don't want me, man?\" What a tearjerker, sitcom or not.\n\nWhat are your favorites?","upvote_ratio":0.71,"created_utc":1677186447.0},{"title":"Trying to understand how an actor can be brilliant in one series yet utterly flat in another","author":"le_fromage_puant","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/television\/comments\/11au1fr\/trying_to_understand_how_an_actor_can_be\/","text":"Is it the script?

That is, movies and tv shows for an audience  between children and teenagers that was \"too old for toys, too young for  boys\". The Disney Channel was a forerunner in this demographic with  smash hits like Hannah Montana, High School Musical, Camp Rock, The  Suite Life of Zack and Cody, Wizards of Waverly Place, That's So Raven,  Kim Possible, and many more. Nickelodeon also had its hits with iCarly,  Zoey 101, Drake & Josh. These shows combine goofy sitcom antics and  childish gags, with hip teenage characters and pop music to make the  largely female child audience think they're watching something aimed at  teenagers.\n\nI've recently  revisited some of these shows (partly out of nostalgia), and upon more  and more research from this general time period of pop culture, it  dawned on me that \"tweens\" as a tangible demographic, makes no logical  sense. The general age range of what is considered \"tweens\" has changed  over the years and varies from person to person, but the most common age  groups cited are \"8 to 12\", \"10 to 12\", or \"9 to 13\", some go as low as  7 year olds.\n\nThe fact that  people can't agree on a specific age group for this concept shows how  flawed it is at its core. That's not to say the idea didn't start out  with good intentions. When Disney Channel first coined the term in the  late 90s, it was mainly to appeal to a niche of kids in middle school  who wanted a more family-friendly alternative to edgier channels like  MTV, which were starting to become popular at that age, but not all kids  felt comfortable with just yet. But then that strategy became too  successful, and suddenly marketeers and toy companies used it as an  excuse to try and sell parent-friendly teen-esque lifestyles to 9 year  olds.\n\nSo middle schoolers  feel like the most accurate description for what the concept of \"tween\" would entail (in between childhood and teenhood). But here's the thing,  Middle school in the US is generally aged 11 to 13, or 10 to 14  depending on your birthday. That's quite a bit older and more narrow  than the age groups that are usually cited when referring to tweens. On  top of that, middle school has always been a notoriously tricky age group when discussing what exactly is \"appropriate\" for that age, due to just how shattered kids are at that age (both psychologically and  physically) thanks to puberty. If you look at any middle school, in any grade, you see a bunch of kids already dating, sneaking drugs, and  talking about adult topics, and then you also have a bunch of kids who  still play with Hot Wheels and Rolblox, or still believe in cooties, and then a bunch of kids who don't fit in on eitther extreme. It's a giant  melting pot, and perhaps the hardest age group to find one size-fits all stuff for compared to younger children or teenagers.\n\nBut I think the ultimate problem with \"tween\" media during this time, was  that it never was a true middle ground between content for kids, and  content for teenagers. There's a really good video on YouTube discussing  this problem comparing a tween show to a teen show, and how drastic the  difference in tone and content is. Where you can instantly go from  squeaky-clean kidcoms, to raunchy, brooding dramas filled with tons of  sex, drugs, and violence.\n\n[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=AxK9G4Q92D0](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=AxK9G4Q92D0)\n\nBasically, the question boils down to, why was there  never any middle ground between \"iCarly\" and \"Gossip Girl\"? To me, the  closest has always been anime. Anime fandom in my view at least, often  peaks during middle school because it's often that middle ground between  \"kids shows\" and \"teen shows\" that you don't find much of in  American-made pop culture, particularly with Shonen and Shojo. Something  like One Piece, Full Metal Alchemist, or newer stuff like My Hero  Academia were a nice combination of colorful worlds, humor, and sense of  adventure and optimism found in children's shows, with still having  more mature themes and content that kids in middle school start to  crave, while also not going too far in themes in content that parents of  a 12 or 13 year old would worry about.\n\nPoint  is, I feel like there has always been kid of a lack of a between \"Kids  stuff\" and \"Teens stuff\" in media, and that \"tween\" over time, just  started becoming an excuse to let 8 year old girls pretend they're teenagers.","upvote_ratio":0.52,"created_utc":1677135899.0},{"title":"Waco: American Apocalypse Official Trailer (Netflix)","author":"Homegrove","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/scZ2x7R_XXc","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.78,"created_utc":1677080181.0},{"title":"HBO\u2019s Leading Man: Casey Bloys on Perfecting \u2018The Last of Us,\u2019 HBO Max Streaming Merger and Axing Shows","author":"misana123","url":"https:\/\/variety.com\/2023\/tv\/features\/last-of-us-white-lotus-casey-bloys-hbo-1235527633\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1677081867.0},{"title":"Joe Cornish & team AMA tomorrow evening (02\/23) at 7 pm GMT\/2pm EST","author":"HackneyCricket","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/television\/comments\/1194xe5\/joe_cornish_team_ama_tomorrow_evening_0223_at_7\/","text":"Hello r\/television!
