My question is, could math have developed in a different direction? Could we have another working definition of convergence, or have alternate algebraic structures, without groups or rings?

        "text": "I am an undergraduate doing an Integrated BS-MS course(it's a 5 year course where we choose our major in the 3rd year) I will choose my major after this summer and am confused between chemistry and mathematics so I am planning to self study mathematics to see if I like it more then chemistry (my first priority). I really enjoy pure mathematics and I hate applied mathematics (it's extremely boring to me). I want to self study analysis(I have taken an introductory analysis course from Kenneth Ross elementary analysis book in 2nd sem but didn't study much because I had a medical condition that whole semester, I did do some proofs and little bit of stuff like induction, triangle inequality, archimedian property etc). I have also studied one semester of linear algebra with some group theory but that course was mostly computation based with no proofs, one course in differential geometry which was my most favourite course till now and one course in probability theory and differential equations (worst course ever) and theory of computation (awesome!). So this summer I want to study analysis which I am planning to do from Abbott's understanding analysis based on reddit posts.\n\nNow I want to also study multivariate calculus, vector calculus and proof based linear algebra. I have heard that Theodore Shifrin's lecture videos are good and contain all these 3 things and a proof based more abstract approach. So should I go with that and follow his book along with lectures or should I study these topics separately like use linear algebra done right for linear algebra and some other book for multivariate calculus and vector calculus\n\nP.S. I will spend 2 and a half months of my 3 month summer vacation in this while giving 4-6 hours of study daily.",

I could probably solve it on my own but it’s the weekend, and I’m not the kind of person who enjoys doing math calculations for fun 😂\n\n\nSo let’s say there’s 8 billion people exactly on the earth right now. And let’s say you were to evenly distribute them across the entire earth. Like equally distribute them so there’s an equal amount of space between each and every person in all directions all over the earth. Sea/mountain level doesn’t matter. It’s an even surface; a sphere that just has the radius/surface area of the earth. How much space would be in between each person in kilometres If you have time, see if you can solve it without asking google for the answer. \nAnd as always, show your work!!!!!",

The distribution can range from 1 neighbor to 10^4 neighbors, so we typically do things like plot them on a log scale. But then the units get funky. For example, it's easy to say 1000 neighbors. But since units are typically multiplicative, doing log(1000 neighbors) seems like it would work out to something like log(1000) + log(1 neighbors) = log(1000). Since log(1)=0, the units just...vanish. \n\nBut that doesn't make sense practically. If I plot the probability density of degree on a log scale, it's still \"degree\" that I'm looking at.",

        "text": "I posted linear algebra and binary matrices question about a week ago but no one offered a reply. I'm not too surprised, as my question is a bit odd. However, I've been researching this topic for months and yesterday I encountered Reese T. Prosser's 1959 paper on Boolean matrices being used to analyze software flow and was hoping someone might be familiar with this topic and more recent and/or similar topics. Does this topic move into graph theory? I have started looking into how graph theory may apply. I'm hoping something might offer suggestions, paper refs, books, etc. that would help me out. \n\n*Applications of Boolean Matrices to the Analysis of Flow Diagrams*, Reese T. Prosser. Proceedings of the Eastern Joint Computer Conference, 1959. \n\nThis paper references Shannon's 1949 paper, *The mathematical Theory of Communication*, and Rosenblatt's, *On the graph and asymptotic forms of finite Boolean relation matrices and stochastic matrices*, 1957, as well as 12 other interesting papers. It seems that as far back as the 1950s and 1960s people started looking into this. \n\nI've been trying to nail down various ways to use binary matrices in hopes of finding ways to apply it to a few compiler optimizations issues. Deep Learning/CNNs can offer some options but I think falling back to linear algebra may offer the best possibilities. Prosser's and Rosenblatt's papers are the first I have found that discuss these topics. I'm hoping someone is aware of more recent sources. Of course, I love the idea that Shannon and Rosenblatt considered some of this stuff as well. But there's not enough there for me to do much with. \n\nIn short, what can we determine from binary matrices? If we are control how they are built and what we include in them, can we not build them in such a way as to them apply various linear algebra approaches to determine various things from the matrices, such as software flow, loops, identify various optimization patterns, etc. It seems like we should be abe to. I just don't know where to find resources on something like this. \n\nSimilar topics might include logical matrix, binary matrix, relation matrix, Boolean matrix, (0,1) matrix, permutation matrix, incidence matrix, design matrix, adjacency matrix, biadjacency matrix, identity matrix, etc. and how they are being used in computer science. \n\nWhat I am looking for are things like Posser is suggesting in his paper, that you can gain insight by doing various transformations of a logical matrix such as taking it's inverse and multiply it back to itself. Apparently there are approaches like this can be used to identify patterns, logic flow, loops, etc. \n\nAny thoughts, suggestions, or references would be much appreciated.",

My question is, if you filled you average bathtub with water, placed your dry feet in water and took them out after a few seconds, then placed them back in after they felt equally as dry as before.  How many times would you have to place them in before all of the water transfered from the bathtub to your feet? (assuming no water is lost to things like evaporation, draining tub, or drops falling out of tub while removing feet)",
