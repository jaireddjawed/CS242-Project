It's almost insulting that such a term that is so intimately intertwined with all kinds of *good* and *useful* German common terms as well as philosophic and cultural is tainted by the gross and travestic lumping into with the putrid darkness of the short Nazi German Reich and era, by some presumptuous mumpsimus- grace to the man regardless.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis really must be corrected. For the sake of all goodness, make a nice stately extensive *section* of the article all about it's affiliation and usage in German nationalism and Nazism of the 20th century all you like, but *please* give proper homage to the perfectly good word and title that is \"Führer\", and don't lump the whole grand and historic thing in with a counfounded *Nazism* portal!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would be significantly more understanding if Wikipedia was merely a cultural archive, as in recent decades this term is certainly almost exclusively understood in culture and politics as in association with the Nazi's. But if Wikipedia will be an objective and extensive archive of collected human knowledge this definite error simply must be rectified.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm more than willing to substantiate any ideas here in further detail if prompted.
