I just went straight to my hotel because i was tired. The next day, the car rental place wanted a little more than I had for a deposit, so my friend came and picked me up. We chatted along the way and she grabbed a plant while we were out. She’s very into plants. \n\nI enjoyed my time, overall. Their son and I chatted about his video game. He’s 7. He also helped me pick dinner (Chipotle). \n\nHow was your weekend?",

Everything from Sonic to Pizza to working at call centers for various companies, etc. I've done quite a bit of different things. What always got me, was I never really enjoyed any of the jobs that I've ever had. I did them because they paid the bills, and provided decent benefits. \n\nA couple of years ago, I moved to a new city and I started off working for Wal-Mart, eventually moved to management, and then moved to another job that was pretty good all things considered working customer service for life insurance. I was able to get good pay, work from home, great benefits, etc. \n\nWell, back in October I applied for a new position that was opening up in the company. After months of waiting, numerous interviews, etc. I was notified that out of 300+ candidates, I was chosen as 1 of 10 people to join this new team. \n\nMy new job will be backend development for our company, updating and upgrading all of the systems that we use on a day to day basis to make them more future proof. It's a brand new team, which means we will be working with senior directors, the CEO, amongst other people and I am over the MOON. \n\nThey said that they chose me because I'm very outspoken when something doesn't work, I have a great ability to be able to \"break things\" and then figure out why/how it broke, etc. What's even cooler is the guy who is running the team was my original manager I had when I started all the way until he moved to the head of the team back in October, so I'll be working alongside him and he and I already have tons of rapport together. \n\nI'm so excited. No more bullshit customer service work, no more adhering to all these stupid phone call metrics, etc. I'll be doing work that actually matters. Not to mention that they said my pay wouldn't change with the new job, but when they called me regarding the job, I actually ended up getting close to a 25% raise. \n\nI'm so excited, and I don't really have anybody to share it with so I figured I would come here and get my excitement out to somebody. This is what I've been waiting on my whole life, and I feel like it's only up from here.",

And their star dish, the chicken mole, tastes like mud now and it’s a quarter chicken instead of half. \n\nMy favorite Costco blueberry muffins went up by $3 and now taste bland and dry when they used to be fluffy and delicious. Cliff builder bars were $6 when I started getting them, now $11 and noticeably thinner. \n\nFuck shrinkflation.",

        "text": "I was just thinking this the other day: on the outside I present for the most part as what society would consider a rough and tumble male based on appearance. I also am not the best at social skills, which can present as being a jerk, but I don't realize I'm doing it. I'll get dirty in the yard, use tools most people wouldn't, do a heavy workout, and so on. My hands are calloused and I regret I've a pretty bad cursing habit, but at the end of the day...\n\n..my outward appearance doesn't for the most part fit me at all. I'm actually a pretty sensitive male. A lot of times, I listen to stuff I'd be embarrassed to share in the real world, like bubblegum pop. I have no problem putting on some cozy pajamas and watching a \"chick flick\", maybe crying a little. The last thing I want to do is \"have beer with the guys\" - and I never did. I have no problem with sticking with my wife at parties with the other wives instead going off with the other guys. I'm not hugely social, but I'd much prefer those conversations to the \"guys\" talking sports and all. I'm especially bothered by men that seem to need to provide opinions on women to each other. If we were at a mall, same thing goes...I'd be happy to look at ladies clothes all day and hold her purse. I have an \"eye\" for what looks good - clothing or interior design.\n\nSexually, I'm a straight male, who considered deeply at one point that I might not be, but have zero attraction to men. I have no urge or desire to dress or otherwise become a woman. In that department, everything feels completely normal. I have hung out with some homosexual men, and have found I am much more comfortable with them than heterosexual men. I can be much more myself in these situations. In some ways, more comfortable even than with women. Maybe it's because they are fully \"out\" and comfortable, so somehow I feel more comfortable letting down my guard and not feeling judged?\n\nNote: I'm not trying to generalize any population here, but to express who I am, and the best way I know how to is alignment to old-school identities. I am sure there are men out there that I could hang out with that feel the same way, but in real life I would not likely meet them unless they divulged all of this about themselves first. Why? I guess at the end of the day, I'm scared. Of what, I don't know exactly. I think in part because I don't know who I am.\n\nThat was a load off of my chest, I didn't think I'd write anything close to that. Hopefully it resonates with at least one other person.\n\nI guess this is pretty open ended now... Is anyone else there that feels like this describes you, even in part? If it's not you, I'm curious what you would think if you found out about a friend or coworker? Do you have other trait(s) that would surprise anyone if they knew?",

A+ show, too bad I've seen no sign of it lately.\n\n2. American Restoration.\n\nI loved this one, idk why it's not on History anymore but I would hapily watch re runs. It was so cool seeing random junk being brought at the shop and at the end of the episode it was like new. So interesting following the process and all.\n\n3. Forging fire.\n\nA couple of gentleman offering expertise on what seems to be a very interesting and enjoyable activity, and then testing the blades by gutting ballistic dummies. No unnecessary drama, no fights, jusy forging and watching how a cool weapon is brought to lige. I also like that they often change the format a little, like \"here we go, the simths will compete against the judges, then the judges against other judges, and champions vs champions\". The episodes just get better and better in my opinion as do the smiths and their blades. \n\n4. Ice Road Truckers\n\nThere's something special about watching trucks go over rough terrain or frozen lakes. \n\n\n5. Pawn stars.\n\nI like it as much as the 2 above, the only difference between them is that Pawn Stars is running all day every day, so i am kind of full of it, but otherwise it's a great show in my opinion. The negotiation part kinda lacks lately, you can easily predict how much they're gonna offer, but still cool finds, and funny moments between the guys.\n\n6. The World Wars.\n\nCan't forget this classic. It's only sixth on this list because I don't remember much about it, except for the fact that I loved it at the time and it sparked my interest in history.\n\n7. Swamp People.\n\nI loved it for Shelby Stanga. I don't remember anything about the other guys but Shelby was a badass and a madman. The guy pulled up in a pirate ship and moved into a precariously built tree house (don't tell me it's all staged, I know, it was just very funny and entertaining)\n\n8. Mountain Men.\n\nWhen it first aired I thought it was an off brand Swamp People but I grew up to like it over the years.\n\n9. Shipping Wars.\n\nLiterally Storage Wars but somewhat better in my opion although not by much. \n\n10. Storage Wars.\n\nIdk, the jokes were funny in 2010 and the characters slowly lost their entertaining value, which is to be expected after so many years. Even the new episodes look like re runs and the spin offs (Texas and New York) are not much better either. This show had its run, but just let it die, man... it should've died long time ago imo.\n\n11. Oak Island.\n\nNever found it interesting. Some guys spinning in circles over a presumed treasure. I thought it was pretty cool at first but got bored pretty quick and honestly I don't know how it made it to 10 seasons\n\n12. Ancient Aliens.\n\nMan this show is a meme in itself. It was somewhat interesting at first, bringing up some interesting facts that made you think they have a point, but it just got weirder and weirder and super far fetched now they're just taking themselves too seriouly imo.\n\nI'm curious to hear what you guys think!",

FIFTEEN CHAPTERS for the final exam. I know some of you might have more than 15, but come on man, I'm talking about at least 25 pages for one chapter. So, we have 4 subjects- History, Civics, Geography and Economics. And somehow the school is going to fit it into an 80 mark paper! While coming home today from the Mathematics paper, me and some of my friends discussed the strategy for the study of SST, since there's only so much you can cover in 1.5 days.\nWe decided fuck geography, do the maps only, since they're of 6 marks; history is pretty good, but still too much. Civics is a subject where we're going to eyeball almost everything, since we pretty much have covered it in the previous classes/exams. Economics might not come a LOT, based on the experiences of past papers of Social Science. Funny story, we originally had 16 chapters, but I guess the school took a little pity on us and cancelled one lesson from history, BUT, they told this to us TODAY! Everyone was pissed because they had kinda learnt that chapter, and also kinda happy that a lesson from history was removed from the portion. \n\n\n\nTLDR: Just me ranting about school and how it sucks 🫠",

In the past I have stayed away from people who gossip and I was happy minding my own business. Off late I’ve been feeling sort of lonely and I feel I need the company of people.

I was like \"why you calling me a dummy, you're the one that forgot\", and she says \"I'm not a dummy, you're a dummy\", and then we went back and forth calling each other dummy like a couple of toddlers for a bit.\n\nLove that little dummy. I wonder what she was trying to tell me.",

Felt like I was in heaven. The cats were so friendly, quite, cuddly, and just amazing to be around. Loved and enjoyed every second of it. \n\nAt the beginning, I was a bit awkward as it was my first time, and I was overwhelmed with how many cats there were in one space and did not know which one to pet. Was also surprised when they had their claws out lol. Had a snack for them, but one of them ended up taking the whole thing for themself. Was introduced to 3 of their names: Bubbles, Holy and prince. \n\nFeel pure bliss right now :)\n\nHave you been to a cat café or something similar? How was your experience like?",

The only problem is that the job is away from where we know and it means taking a few steps back. But it's only temporary because all the hard work means a better future.\n\nSo we did it, and it seems so much harder than it was. Money is tighter because rent in the city is more than our mortgage, people at work aren't exactly the outgoing type, and every day is a constant reminder about how hard it is to start over making new friends. Then we get blindsided by a parent dying suddenly, surprise bills, and our dog starting to show some signs of decline too.\n\nI never expected things to go perfectly, but I also never expected them to start off so poorly either. I know things will get easier, it has to because I'm willing to put in the work to make it get easier. It's just tough to keep a positive outlook sometimes.\n\nWriting this out has been really cathartic, thanks.",

If not, why? \n\nAnd if you agree this is a part of being human, is this a concern when it comes to how popular real robot android people will be if we can make them realistic?

This isn’t about circlejerking I just want everyone to know my state of mind as I lay this whole debacle out there.\n\nIt’s currently 10pm and I’m enjoying a bowl of fruity pebbles, got Frank Ocean playing, messaging friends online. I made the mistake of mentioning that I’m eating fruity pebbles, and my friends are like oh do you do milk first or cereal first. I said I do cereal first and pour the milk like all over it to make the fruity pebbles mushy.\n\nThey reacted oddly to this, saying “that’s kinda strange”. I probably should have just laughed and said “yeah you might be right” and dropped it but I disagreed, I don’t like when I have the munchies and wolf down my snacks and the food’s crunchy enough to tear up the roof of my mouth. Anyone who’s tried Captain Crunch knows what I mean\n\nSince I’m blazed I went into way too much detail describing my cereal eating process, which is where I fucked up. I said some shit like “yeah, no, I like kind of basting the cereal like butter on a steak to wet the dry cereal. That way it leaves enough milk at the bottom to kind of match the amount of cereal and you can drink it like soup at the end.” Apparently that was the wrong thing to say. I have like three people saying I eat cereal like a monster but I feel like they’re biased to pick fun at me. Am I wrong here?? I can’t be the only one who eats cereal like this",

She said that her cousin Stephanie had those at her wedding. I asked if it was the same Stephanie that would be in attendance with her husband at our wedding, and she said it was. Sarah and Stephanie are apparently pretty close, and she started telling me about Stephanie and her husband.\n\nAt one point, she told me that Stephanie had actually cheated on her husband twice before they got married, and that the second time was a couple of months before the actual wedding. Her husband never found out. I asked her why she never told Stephanie's husband what happened, and she responded by saying that it \"wasn't \\[her\\] circus, wasn't \\[her\\] monkeys\" and that it's not that big of a deal anyway since they weren't married at the time.\n\nI've been thinking about what she said ever since. I consider cheating the ultimate, worst betrayal in a relationship. Clearly, my fiancée doesn't think so since she said her cousin cheating \"wasn't that big of a deal since they weren't married.\" Would this mean that she thinks cheating on me right now wouldn't be that big of a deal since we aren't married yet?\n\nAs a man, if I got cheated on by my partner, I hope someone who knew about it would tell me. I would heavily judge anyone who knew about it, didn't tell me, let me go on to marry the person that cheated on me, and attended my wedding as if nothing was wrong. Like my fiancée did to her cousin's husband.\n\nA couple of hour ago, I texted my fiancée \"I'm not sure if I can go forward with getting married. Let's talk in person later tonight.\" She's been blowing up my phone with texts and missed calls ever since. I'm just going to tell her what I've said in this post when I see her.",

        "text": "My brother and I suffered from abuse from our stepdad for all of our childhood. I’ve developed more mental health problems than him and I’ve always been seen as the bad egg in the family. The first time I su*c*dal was when I was 12 and he saw me go through phases of depression and addiction throughout my teens.\n\nFast forward to Christmas of 2020, the first COVID Christmas. I was living alone, deeply depressed and alone. I was planning on committing su*c*de and I genuinely thought that it was the end. An urge told me to text my mom and she rushed over and called my brother over. They argued with me and called an ambulance for me. I never got a text or call from my brother after I was released from the hospital.\n\nI forgave him, in private but I received no apology or care for my well being at all.\n\nDecember 2021 I had another bad bout of depression. I asked my brother and my mom to help me with my new apartment. I called it off because of intense su*c*dal ideation. One night we were casually eating dinner and it was brought up that I had bailed that one night. My brother says “Oh yeah, you threw a fit that’s we never did it”.\n\nThat sentence is when all my love for him died inside of me. I think of it constantly. I cut off contact with him and didn’t attend his wedding. I just couldn’t believe someone would think of me like that. I don’t want someone like that in my life. Sometimes I feel like a shitty person who should have gone for my family. But it hurt too much. I think I am a bad person.",

        "text": "(Apologies if I've made any grammar mistakes, it is quite late here.)\n\nI've always had troubled explaining why I like or want certain things, I usually just say \"I like it\" or \"it's cool I guess\" even though said thing could be one of my favourite thing ever. In fact, I feel like the more I like something the less I talk about it, be it food or fictional characters (yes, I'm a weeb). I can explain why something *is* good, especially visually, but even then it's pretty difficult for me and that always mean I like it, like a movie villain for example. \n\nIt's actually becoming a problem in my professional life, as I can't properly explain why I'd like to work in certain environments over other and Express my motivations for example.\n\nSo I was wondering if you guys got any tips?\nDescribing why you like something or someone can also help, anything is welcome.",

        "text": "My girlfriend is a surprisingly very coherent sleep talker, everything she says is interesting n sometimes she’ll say silly things and laugh, or she’ll say romantic things which is really sweet cause i like to think that she’s dreamin of us haha \n\nor sometimes she’ll say slightly concerning things.. not exactly nightmare stuff but things that give the impression that she’s stressed in her dream-state. \n\nOne night she sounded a lil worried about something in her dream, so I touched her hand and reassured her that everything was okay. My lady is a pretty hard sleeper so I felt okay talking to her knowing i won’t disturb her. Ever since then, I’ve been enjoying our little sleepy “conversations”. \n\nShe’s been having a lot of good dreams so far and is very animated in her sleep! shes so cute!! I find this lil quirk about her absolutely adorable, and I enjoy tagging along on her dream adventures, but I also realize it can be a bit weird that I respond to everything she says lol, I don’t want to mess with her psyche so I just speak neutrally or tell her nice things. Sometimes when she’s not sleep talking I’ll tell her words of affirmation in hopes that it’ll make her feel good when she wakes up, lowkey I think it’s actually working? Lol\n\nOnce, my gf while asleep said something along the lines of “it’s backwards and upside down” \nso I was like “oh, sorry, I’ll fix it for you… better now?” and she gave me a little smirk and said “perfect.” Then rolled over in a blanket burrito haha\n\nI was wondering if anybody else does this with their partner/family/friend or roommate? and what are some funny things you’ve heard! (If you’d like to share)\np.s. thanks for reading :)",

Neither of us really feels like our birthdays or other major family memorable days are special. For instance we don't do anything for the anniversary of our parents' deaths.\n\nWhile my wife keeps tons of family photos,  my brother and I keep barely anything. My wife will also frequently feel bad the entire week of her father's passing - and again I won't even mention mine at all.\n\nI've also noticed that my sister too is very focused on birthdays/death events. She'll even post on Facebook during our father's birthday and along with photos with her and our dad.\n\nAnother thing my wife does is frequently talk about her high school or university - me I never mention those times in my life.\n\nI've also seen here on Reddit, when someone is terminally ill, a commentator will recommend they should make videos and recordings for their loved ones. I find this very bizarre as in the last 8 years my parents have been dead, I've maybe looked at videos or photos of them 3 times max.\n\nSo why do some people feel more nostalgic for the past and loved ones than others? And also - does it relate to celebrating birthdays at all?",
