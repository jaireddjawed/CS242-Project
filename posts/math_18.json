I know, I will take a major when I am done, and the major will be either statistics or pure mathematics.   \n\n\nBut I am a little unsure of in regards to job opportunities and in regards to how interesting each one of them would be. So I kinda want to hear about your experiences with jobs and working with math but also how u liked or did not like your specialization at college.",

Since n is the product of every element in set A, and therefore every prime number, n is a multiple of every prime number. Therefore, n±1 is a new prime number. You can then create a new set, B, which contains the first set, A, n+1 and n-1. You then multiply every element in set B together to get a new number, and repeat infinitely. Every multiplication will result in a new set of twin primes, therefore there are infinite twin primes.\n\nI don’t know if this proves the Twin Prime Conjecture true, false, unprovable or does absolutely nothing. I can’t be bothered to figure that out. You can do that instead.",

Drawing on a flat blackboard is ok, but if you start drawing curves on a surface with a non-trivial fundamental group or something gets a little tricky. I can also imagine there are a couple other uses to build intuition for thinking about curvature that a different whiteboard surface could help with. \n\nIve googled around before but cant seem to find anything. I was also thinking of making my own by using whiteboard paint or something like that, but I'm curious if anyone has seen this or something along these lines done before? Seems like it could be a neat toy to have and pull out every now and then.",

However since I started studying mathematics I noticed how this love began to fade.  \n\nThere are still moments when I think the lectures are fascinating, but more often than not I think they are merely okay and sometimes boring. I stoped exploring math in my free time. I did expect that not every course would be mind blowingly fascinating, but I didn't expect it to be like this. Also I thought it would be more theoretical and less Homework style calculation. (yes I expected less math in mathematics)\nI don't know if this is because I'm still in the beginning of my education, or if it is simply to much math (35-45 hours per week) and I should take some other courses to deversify my education.\n\nI would be very greatful for any advise. I feel like I'm losing a hobby and part of my personality. Have any of you expirienced similar feelings, or have any advise? Should I should switch subject (after all I'm still in the beginning and in my country it is free to change subject)? Will this Pass? \n\nThank you",

P(T,N) will represent the probability of team T winning its Nth round game. Thus P(2,1) is the probability of Team 2 winning its first round game.\n\nTo give an example of one 4 team sub-bracket’s first two rounds:\n\nP(1,1) = 75, P(1,2) =36, P(2,1) = 25, P(2,2) = 7, P(3,1) = 81, P(3.2) = 50, P(4.1) = 19, P(4,2) = 7\n\nSince I am only looking at the second round, the updated second round probabilities can only possibly be affected by the results of the four teams in the local bracket.\n\nFirst round: Game 1-Team 1 plays Team 2, Game 2 -Team 3 plays Team 4\n\nSecond round: the Winner of Game 1 plays the winner of Game 2.\n\nNow assume the first round games are played and Team 1 and Team 4 win.\n\nObviously: P(2,2) and P(3,2) are now 0. What are the new P(1,2) and P(4,2)? Assume no other information is gathered other than the outcome of the first 2 round games,\n\nI was hoping an application of Bayes' Theorem would work here. A - the event Team 1 wins Game 2. B - the event Team 4 wins Game 1. Then we are looking for P(A|B) = (P(B|A) \\* P(A))/P(B). We would have P(A) and P(B), but I could not figure out P(B|A) either..\n\nIs this possible? Other ideas? Please discuss how you would approach this problem.",

        "text": "We all know that you cannot divide by 0. No real or complex number multiplied by 0 equals anything except 0. But what if we try and open a concept like what we did with imaginary numbers?\n\nBecause those numbers will not interact with 0 the same way as other numbers, we can call them Stubborn numbers, symbolised with S. That is done so we can say that S*0=1. That means that S=1/0. So 2S=2/0, S^2=(1/0)*(1/0)=1/0=S.\n\nThere are a few problems, which I will open with 0/0. Let x=0/0, x*0=0, X can be any number. So we are still left with 1 impossible division by 0 case.\n\nAnd now I can tackle other problems. We cannot divide it by itself (S/S=(1/0)/(1/0)=(1/0)*(0/1)=0/0 which cannot be defined with the concept), we cannot multiply it by 0 (S*0=(1/0)*(0/1)=0/0 which is an impossible concept as I said before).\n\nIt doesn't want to work with all arithmetic functions, but I feel like defining it may bring some answers. Infinity multiplied by 0 is pretty unstable. It can be any number we want, because both definitions cancel eachother in a way that lets it do that. But with S, you can safely multiply by 0 and get a non-zero answer.\n\nI don't see any practical use for it, but it is just a concept and can never be explained fully. As another concept we have use for, and I said above, were imaginary numbers. So why not do the same for \"Stubborn Numbers\"?",

My goal is to understand it well enough to know what the Yangs-Mill problem is all about, both physically and mathematically, and all as rigorous as possible. For some background, I'm doing my MS in mathematical physics and I've gone through most of Tu's book on smooth manifolds as well as parts of Lee's book. I don't have much exposure to Lie theory or representation theory beyond the very basics. On the physics side of things I don't know much about gauge theory other than the basics you can find in an introductory electrodynamics book. \n\nThe trouble I have been having is that I cannot find an appropriate resource to learn from. The physics books are almost inaccessible due to the cultural difference between math and physics. The math books seem either too advanced and omit the physics. Most of the math books are also quite long so I wanted to get some advice before I commit to one. A few books books I am considering include \n\n* Naber's two volume series \"Topology, Geometry, and Gauge Fields\" \n* Hamilton's \"Mathematical Gauge Theory\" \n* John Baez's \"Gauge Fields, Knots, and Gravity\"\n\nI'm open to other resources/books as well.",
