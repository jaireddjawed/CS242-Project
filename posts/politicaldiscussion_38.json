Is there historical precedent?\n\nWhat do you think this means for Jeff Flake's bargain to vote yes in committee as long as there was an FBI investigation? Will this be satisfactory and ensure his yes vote on the floor? What about other potential R swing votes?\n\nIs this all just theater? Will Kavanaugh withdraw from consideration before the investigation is complete -- is that perhaps the real goal? Do you think there's anything that could come of this investigation that will truly prevent Kavanaugh from being confirmed?\n\n**EDIT:** Trump has since [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1046230634103025664) that the FBI may talk to whomever they feel is appropriate. Does this change your opinion on the initial limitations?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/9jzgqm/what_are_the_major_failure_points_in_the_american/",
        "text": "Prior to Trump's presidency I think a lot of Americans believed that the US system was imperfect, but at the very least, robust. However, looking back at the prior 25 years, I think it's difficult to argue that we haven't witnessed a deterioration in the health of our system. At this point it's a platitude that many of the institutions relating to the presidency rely on unwritten convention and \"normal order\" to function properly, or even at all. But the change has not just been at the top. The now-widespread practice of \"constitutional hardball\", now practiced by both Republicans and Democrats, has led to new norms in government. The term, [as coined by Mark Tushnet](https://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1557&amp;context=facpub), is defined as follows:\n\n&gt; [Constitutional hardball] consists of political claims and practices-legislative and executive initiatives-that are without much question within the bounds of existing constitutional doctrine and practice but that are nonetheless in some tension with existing pre-constitutional understandings. It is hardball because its practitioners see themselves as playing for keeps in a special kind of way; they believe the stakes of the political controversy their actions provoke are quite high, and that their defeat and their opponents' victory would be a serious, perhaps permanent setback to the political positions they hold.\n\nTaken to its extreme, constitutional hardball can paralyze the government or lead to systemic collapse. What I'm interested in is the actual provisions in our system that can be exploited and lead to this collapse when not used in good faith. There are some examples that are common and to which we are now accustomed:\n\n1. The Hastert rule, where no no legislation can advance without one party controlling all houses of government and the presidency\n1. Gerrymandering, where one party can entrench a systemic advantage by controlling district lines\n1. The executive declining to enforce certain laws at the federal level\n\nHowever, there are more creative and radical mechanisms that no side has yet used in the modern era and are technically allowed under our system:\n\n1. Raising the number of supreme court seats and packing the court with partisan judges\n1. Gerrymandering state lines themselves by splitting reliably red or blue state to boost the number of Senators in that camp\n1. The use of blanket pardons by the executive to effectively nullify certain dully passed laws\n\nThe more of these become common practice, the weaker and more unrepresentative our government becomes, until it collapses; at a certain point, if institutional advantage is so entrenched on one side or another, it becomes a legitimate question as to whether the country wants to remain whole, and there can be literal revolution.\n\nMy question is, are there others points of failure? What are the major legal provisions in our system that are highly exploitable, and could lead to entrenchment of unfair advantage to one side, paralysis, or systemic failure if completely exploited?",
