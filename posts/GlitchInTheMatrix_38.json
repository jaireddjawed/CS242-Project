        "text": "Happened Wednesday the 16th at about 7pm. I was driving to a Panera to meet up with some friends, we have a regular get-together on Wednesdays. Take the same route I usually take and get to a stop light where I need to make a left. There's two left turn lanes and one lane to go straight.\n\nThere's one vehicle infront of me in the left-turn lane and another to my left in the other turn lane. We get the green arrows pointing left, which is a signal that we're all clear and don't have to yield.\n\nWell... the only problem is the cross-traffic DOES NOT STOP. So the traffic going left to right infront of us, not the oncoming traffic. And it wasn't one guy running a red light. The cross-traffic continued for the duration of the green light. Now I would say - okay, this is just a traffic light malfunction ... EXCEPT...\n\nThat the car infront of me just pulled forward like nothing was wrong and somehow managed to make a left-turn admist this flow of cross traffic. I honestly have no idea how he didn't get hit. Like it just... I didn't see how that worked. \n\nAnd the car to my left didn't move. I tried to see if the driver thought all of this was strange but couldn't see him really through the glare of his windshield. So after about 20 seconds our green light turned red, I sat through the next red light, and then it turned green and everything was normal again.\n\nI have no idea what happened but it really messed with my mind. I kept questioning whether I had just mistakenly taken RED for GREEN? But that doesn't seem to be very likely. The most likely explanation probably is that there was a malfunction, but, that's one hell of a malfunction at a stoplight, to give green arrows to a left turn lane while the cross traffic has the green as well.\n\nOh almost forgot - at the next light 4 cars just blew through the red light, but like very nonchalantly as if it were green for them. So. I don't know. I don't know if people were just being asshole drivers that day or what was going on.",

I'm not one to mingle by the Dumpster with the other smokers, so I usually walk at the far end of the parking lot where no one else goes, so at least they can't claim I'm bugging people with the smell. For entertainment I kick rocks down the length of the lot, trying to see how many spaces I can skip.\n\nYesterday afternoon I basically kicked a rock into non-existence. I actually watched it disappear, at the height of its momentum - as if it had suddenly hit an invisible barrier and then slipped behind a curtain. I thought maybe the sunny afternoon was playing tricks on my eyes, so I went looking all around, even though I knew there was no way it could've gone very far - it was a soft kick, enough to propel the rock about a single parking space ahead. It was too big to have gotten caught in my shoe without me noticing. I kept looking anyway, but I know what I saw! Nothing big or exciting, but still, a fun little glitch and my very first experience to boot!",

        "text": "First let me just say..I'm very new to reddit. I stumbled across this subreddit from lurking on r/nosleep and r/letsnotmeet. With that being said, after reading everyone's stories and experiences I never thought something like this could ever happen to me. \n\nMy boyfriend and I just recently bought a house. We haven't moved in yet, because we've been cleaning and renovating our new home. \n\nSunday we spent the whole day at the house cleaning and painting. When we opened the house out we left the key in the door, like we always do so we don't lose it in the mix of cleaning up. Towards the end of the day, my boyfriends sister stopped by to help us wrap some of our work up. Out of nowhere she comes out with a broom and starts sweeping. \n\nI was confused because I didn't bring the broom from our apartment in the car with us over to the house when we went over that morning. She said it was just in the hallway. Odd, but it's a broom, perhaps the people who lived here before left it behind and had the same one as us. \n\nWe're leaving the house and the key that was in the lock all day long was nowhere to be found. We searched that house for two hours, even ripping trash bags open to see maybe the key fell in as we were carrying trash out of the house. We couldn't find the key anywhere. Gave up, went home, and left the house unlocked. \n\nWe get back to our apartment and I notice there was some dirt on the floor. I walk over to our broom closet and open it up. We have little hooks and I always have the broom hanging inside the closet. The broom that we never took from the house to begin with, is missing. In it's place is the key to the house. \n\n",

        "text": "I am very happy to have come across this thread, because I've had several glitchy incidences in my life and am very glad to read that others have as well.  \nOne that comes to mind happened when I was living in England in 2002. My husband and I were driving around the B roads of Suffolk, England in our tiny Vauxhall Cavalier when we stopped for errands. We got back in the car and he handed me his wallet to put under the dash, we'd need it free to show ID later. I placed the wallet in a little shelf under the dash and we drove on. When we arrived at the gate, I reached for his wallet and it was gone. We searched the car for MONTHS because neither of us could explain how it vanished. Neither of us left the car at any time between my placing the wallet on the shelf and arriving at the gate. It was also a rainy day and our windows were us. At first he was angry with me because it had vanished in my posession..but after having no explanation and no found wallet ever in the history of owning the car, we stopped mentioning it because it all seemed a little uncomfortable and weird.  \nA second glitch has also never been explained. When I was about 7 I came home from school and found a bunch of girls clothes in the dryer. Some fit my sister and I, but they weren't ours and our parents had no idea where they came from. No one else had been in the house, certainly not with laundry, and no one ever mentioned it. I remember there was a bathing suit in there that I kept, but some of the clothes were too small or worn and my parents threw them out.   The strangest coincidence I've experienced was this: when I lived in  England my husband purchased a brown canvas jacket for me from a little boutique. The brand was Motel, and the size was XS. The jacket was also kind of expensive, so I never saw anyone else with one. I liked the jacket and wore it a lot, but after a while it was too tight across the chest so I kept it in the closet and wore it less.   \nThis was in ~2001. Since that time, I moved to Maryland, Pennsylvania and several times within Philadelphia.  I gave the jacket away at a clothing swap in 2005 when I was moving to Hawaii. A year after I moved to Hawaii, I moved back to Philly and again, several times within Philly. Last August I moved into a house in a neighborhood I've never lived in. Three people live with me here, and one of them was here when I moved in. I knew none of the people that live here before I moved in.  \nOne day I came home to find a brown jacket on my housemate's rocking chair. A sense of uncanny creepiness fell over me...was this my jacket from 9 years ago?? In this new house?? No one in the house wears an XS besides me...I'm 4'11, this jacket wouldnt fit them.  \nSure enough, the jacket is XS, Motel.  I try it on. It's too tight around the chest. the zipper is slightly broken at the bottom. It is absolutely my jacket, purchased for me 14 years ago in the UK, given away in 2005 to a stranger and somehow it ends up IN MY NEW HOUSE in my living room.  \nTurns out a friend of my housemate left it here a year before at a party- and that girl got it from a clothing swap half a city away 9 years ago. So strange.  \nAlso, I have a picture of myself wearing the coat that I keep in the pocket, in case I tell the story!",

I usually freak out and think my car will be stolen but I never freaked out about it being broken into like that. Just a weird story to share, anyone had weird experiences like this?",

I just found this subreddit and think all this is very interesting and all but would actually like a real answer to something. \n\nBack in March '13, I was putting my key into the door of my building in Philly. It was a single key, all blue, and had a picture of Nemo the fish on it. It was a housewarming gift from my mom.\n\n I slip it into the door lock and hear a voice behind me say \"Please, could I just have something for the train?\" I turn around and see a homeless woman on the sidewalk. I had some change in my pocket from lunch so I gave her what I had. \n\nI get back to the lock and the key is gone. I had no idea what could have happened. I rationalized that I must have pocketed it when the lady asked me for chance and assumed i somehow misplaced it.  My roommate let me in and I got a spare key. \n\nA couple months pass and I forget about the whole ordeal. What happened to me next was around August '13 and I honestly can't wrap my head around it. \n\nI drove down to Atlantic City to fix up my family's condo so renters could move in for the week. I was airing out the living room while cooking dinner for my brother. He was watching some cop show on TV. I throw some sheets into the dryer and get back to the food. \n\nOnly I hear something. The dryer's clicking. I open it to get whatever change's been rattling around and pull a blue Nemo key. I was amazed before I thought anything else of it. Then I heard the TV. I don't know what the context was but someone was yelling at someone else, \"All I wanted was something for the train.\"\n\nI don't know what I felt but it wasn't safe. I couldn't stand for a second. It's been nagging at me ever since. I checked the key on my lock at home and it still works. \n\nI hate this kind of shit. There aren't solid answers. \n",

It happened a few times after, as well. I was in my room one night and looked up at my alarm clock across the room. It appeared to zoom out, and then looked like it was maybe triple the normal distance away. \nI was terrified of it each time it happened, and I haven't told anyone about it for fear of being labelled as crazy.

I had meant to yell, \"Hey, wait for me!\" but it came out all monotone and zombie sounding. I told him what happened but he was impatient to get to sleep because it was past our bedtime, so he didn't really listen to me. I thought about it a lot in the days after that, and I know fugue states are a verifiable phenomenon. But I often wonder what actually happened during those hours that I was \"out,\" specifically in the moments directly after the fugue started. I asked my friends at school and my brother, and apparently I was acting normal or at least like myself the entire time.",

One minute she was walking down the side walk, then she just ceased to exist. \n\nMy boyfriend asked \"What's up?\" When he noticed me looking around, confused. \n\"I just saw a girl disappear.\" I explained what I had seen and he looked around for the girl too. But she was gone. \n\nIt immediately reminded me of something similar happening when I was a kid. I was about 8 or so when my family and I were driving home from town one night. There was no one around except for this man who was walking right out onto the road in front of our car. I panicked because we were about to hit him, but just as he walked behind/past a street lamp, he disappeared. It was so bizarre. The street lamp was just near the edge of the road, and if he had walked out the other side we would definitely have known. He was walking at such a pace that he couldn't have changed direction in the time it took for us to pass the street light, so there was no where he could have gone. Just like the girl I saw yesterday. \n\nI'm still really confused. I hadn't thought much about the vanishing man for a while, I had just kind of assumed it was a one-off weird experience or something. I don't know. But seeing the same kind of thing happen again in broad day light and right in front of me got me thinking again. Has anyone else seen the same kind of thing/have any possible explanation? ",

        "text": "Typed on my phone, sorry for grammar. I will later add descriptions of all the places, but that's going to take to long here.\n\nAround a year ago I learned to lucid dream, all the powers of a god with out any responsibility. You know the in defendable attacker dream, it becomes fantastically funny. Well after doing this for several months I had a lucid dream, I wake up in bed, not the one I sleep in but a different one \"weird oh well\" I think. Jump down and attempt to fly, I cant. \"Huh this hasn't happened before.\" Try to \"manafest\" water, I can't. I hear a noise behind me turn around to see a girl and a bottom bunk (the beds are literally imbedded in the wall.) \"What are you doing silly?\" \"Oh you know trying to fly or make water, I can't though.\" I attempt again. She laughs, at this point I'm thinking \"ok let's just play this out, weird, but no big deal. This is just a different kind of lucid dream.\" She gets fruits I've never seen before for breakfast, I eat them, really  sweet good taste, like better apples. We get dressed, and she says \"off to school.\" We all down a stone and dirt road to an odd building. Square almost, looks broken. Smooth stone like the road. Nothing of significance happens I wake up in real life however as I go to sleep in the dream. Three real days later, I'm still having these dreams. I've learned that this girl is someone I'm dating. We live near the ocean, and apparently in a place like newzealand. No one there knows what cell phones are, marriage is, and in the third dream some bizzare things happen, first I notice my and no one else's hands are like a humans. At the joints there are indentions like a meryionet (sp?) everyone is a vegetarian, suggesting you eat meat isn't \"bad\" it's \"gross\", people's skin looks smoother, everyone is a-gender, with a ting of un human reds and blue. I can' remember faces at all or names. At a prolific moment that nearly induced a panic in the dreami looked at a dream friend and said \"I have to pee in my other life,\" fell asleep in the dream and awoke peed and woke up in class. I ran out of class, to my apartment in dream. He comes by and we talk, I had told him about my \"dreams\" (or real life ha) he tells me that I'm taking it to seriously. A few panicked dream days later I realize this life is really nice in a lot of ways. Some things are not as awesome, procreation exists, sex isn't \"a thing\" though. This goes on for weeks. 3 and 2 days to be exact. On the last day my in dream girlfriend dies at the beach, while I'm at school. I come back to my appartment and people are waiting on me. \"You need to sit down\" after they tell me I'm not to upset, they tell me I'm in shock but I'm thinking \"this is just a dream who cares?\"  I demand to see a mirror (forgot to mention but these are rare in dream land) a friend leaves to get one. In the dream I begin to feel actually up set, and begin to bawl. I stand up and start shouting  \"I'm just going to wake up and it's all going to be over, it doesn't matter!\" More \"your just in shock\" the guy comes back with a mirror. I'm feeling the most heavy depression I've ever felt in my life, even in real life. I look in the mirror and I cannot remember what I saw but I was horrified. In lucid dreams I ALWAYS look the same. I can only imagine that I didn't. I start screaming that I'm going to wake up. When they restrain me I start bashing my head into the back of one of the funny dream chairs. I black out. I wake up in real life to my sister, \"hey don't look so good.\" Sure enough small fever, congestion, cough. I take some tyelonol, and crash after peeing. I wake back up in dream land to \"he's waking up\" the sadness from my dream in real life had been aleviated, in dreamland it's back. I appologise, thinking \"fuck.\" \"Hey, we're you referring to your \"other life\" earlier?\" \"Somthing like that\" \"I know you were in shock, but this is real life.\" \"I know, when did you say the funeral was?\" \"Two days from now, it's getting late, you should get some rest.\" \"I'm not sleeping till then.\"  A spot of arguing ensues. It's decided that someone will stay up with me. 36 dream hours pass with me sitting, crying, talking, pacing in that room with this guy. I accidentally fall asleep, I wake up. As soon as I do my sister comes in the room, \"Describethedescriber, you have been asleep for over 36 hours. Are you ok?\" \"Yes\" I reply and I get up for about 4-5 hours. I go back to sleep attend the funeral, and haven't been able to recall dreams since\n\nI'll add a bit more when I can get behind my computer. :)",

Roughly 1/3 of it (starting on the right) was flickering between darkness and light, which would be understandable if it were illuminating itself, but it was not, the sign is just painted and was illuminated by the lights around it (which were not flickering). Something was causing that shadow to be displayed. But what? As I said, literally nothing else was flickering, so it couldn't have been the street lights or store lights, since that flickering would have caused shadows all over the place. \n\nI don't know how to explain this, but for tired ol' me, it felt like the world was stuttering.

It was cold and snowing, (I live in upstate NY).\n\n\nSuddenly, I heard a whistle -- the Navy kind, (I think called a boatswain) make that classic three notes (low, high, low). They also used it on Star Trek, when there was an announcement about to be made.\n\n\nIt came from outside, to my back right... sounded to be about 20 - 30 feet away.\n\n\nI didn't think much of it -- just figured it was some kid screwing around (I live in a suburban neighborhood). But then, maybe 10 minutes later, it happened again. Then again... about 5 more times, every 5 minutes or so. \n\n\nAt this point, I became annoyed, and looked through the window blinds. No sign of anyone. And the ground was covered with snow, with no tracks of any kind.\n\n\nA few moments after I sat back down, the whistling came again -- but this time, three times in a row, about 10 - 15 seconds apart. It was if the person blowing the whistle had seen me, and was taunting me.\n\n\nThis is where it gets really weird.\n\n\nWithin moments after that third whistle... I heard it again...\nbut this time, loud and clear,  *directly out of my laptop speakers*!\n\n\nAfter that, the whistling stopped.\nIt was as if the last whistle was the \"grand finale\".\n\n\nNeedless to say, I was freaked. \n\n\nHere are the possible explanations I have come up with so far, all unsatisfactory:\n\n\n1. I had a number of browser windows open. Maybe an ad on one of the opened websites was looping the\nwhistle noise, and I somehow had an auditory miscue, and only thought I heard it from the outside.\n\n\nProblems with the above: if that were the case, why did the whistling happen so close together,\n3 times in a row, after I looked outside? And why did I suddenly hear it from my speakers, after hearing it outside all the other times?\n\n\n2. I was hallucinating.\nProblem with this: I've never hallucinated in my life, don't drink or take drugs,  and have never done hallucinogens in my life. And I wasn't overly tired. I regularly work late.\n\n\n3. Glitch.\n\n\nAny suggestions as to what else could have happened?",

It's very easy to get lost there, there's a lot of trees and it has lots of similar-looking streets. They also have their own police force which is known for being really, really strict. There are other stories about paranormal stuff people have seen there. Ghosts, mutant animals, that sort of thing. One day in high school (10 years ago), my two friends and I are bored, driving around town. We used to get deliberately lost and would have a good time finding our way out. We decided to be brave and get lost that neighborhood. None of us had ever been there, but we had all heard its legends. It was about 3pm when we went in to the neighborhood (one of the friends had an appointment that was over at 3 and he hooked up with us afterwards) and we got SO LOST. It was the worst yet. It took us at least a couple hours to get out. We weren't really paying attention to the time because we were too busy belting out Beck and Cake songs. We eventually found our way out, and after much celebrating one of us looks at a watch...it was 1pm. We gained like four hours. We definitely went in at 3 (might have been 3:30) because of my friend's appointment, and we were in there for so long. The three of us are still good friends and we talk about the incident every so often. None of us can explain it.",

All of the sudden, after months of trying the wrong username/password combo, it logged me in, without me changing anything.**\n\nAbout a year ago, a local channel did a news piece on my wife, who's a letter carrier for USPS. What was noteworthy was she decided to work up until the day before delivery, so she was delivering mail 9 months pregnant. My wife is a badass (and my daughter, too). I created an account so I could post the video on reddit.\n\nI never really used the account after. Maybe I'm a bad person, but I just wasn't into participating. I'd browse reddit now and then (mostly using the Reddit Is Fun app) but just was never bothered to log in again.\n\nLast June, I switched from Android to iPhone. I also moved to a position that involves a lot of hurry-up-and-wait time- the prescription for which is often futzing around on reddit. Reddit Is Fun isn't available on iPhone, so I downloaded AlienBlue. Which is fine, but I decided to try my credentials so I wouldn't see the default front page every time I loaded it (and ten thousand adviceanimals memes).\n\nSo I put the account name in on AB, and tried my most common password (I almost always use one of three derivations of one that I change about every year. Probably not an ideal practice, but, hey). \n\nNone of my password combos worked, so every time I started the app, it pulled up a warning that signon could not be completed. I tried to clear it out, but I just never did it (AB is actually a little confusing in that regard, but it's a fine app nonetheless. And apparently magical).\n\nThis went on for about six months. I'd hop on Reddit two or three times a day, browse around while I was waiting on a report to download or waiting on an answer back from upstairs or on a poop break or whatever, and every time I'd get the little warning that logon could not be completed. \n\nThen, sometime last week, the popup stopped. I hadn't changed anything, but the account name was in there, and I could upvote or downvote (couldn't submit because I didn't have AB Pro, but, hey). \n\nI never changed the password. I'm not even fully sure how to change the password.

The other things are detectors that activate an electromagnetic lock, and both are sold separately (keys and detectors).\nWhen you buy any amount of keys, they don't come sorted or anything like that, they are just packed in a small box like a bunch of snacks.\nEach key has a copper coil with a tiny chip to reflect back to the detector the individual code of the key.\n\nHere's the weird thing. I said every key was unsorted when they came packaged. I just grabbed random keys and tied them alongside a simple insulated copper cable (you can barely notice them in the photo) in batches, so the task of registering and delivering the keys is easier. Then I noticed, that every-single-key from a single batch had the exact same amount of time between beeps from the detector. Every. Single. One.\nThen I grabbed another batch, the timing was noticeably slower, but again, every single key from that batch had the same slower timing. The same happened with the other batches.\n\nI can't find a scientifical explanation to this. The detector is too simple to allow this kind of occurrence. I've even went half retard for the lulz and snatched a key from a batch and put it in another, but that specific key had the original timing.\nThe model is HM1000-A, although this information is useless without the brand, which I cannot recall right now.\nThe 226 to 250 batch is the fastest.\n\n[Link to video.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvBHwBzO_uQ) pls ignore awkward laughing and spanish comedy\n\n[Link to photos.](http://imgur.com/pipyJki,jpu720D)\n\nI'd recommend watching the video in Full HD with a 93° television for maximum cinematic experience.",

        "text": "**TL;DR: I somehow knew my grandfather had died before anybody else but my aunt knew, and my great grandmother came visiting me because she wanted great grandchildren but died before my birth**\n\n10 years ago, I was with my family on vacation in Tunisia. When we had to go home, our flight was delayed for more than 24 hours, so we were spending the day in the airport.\n\nThat's where I was sitting right across from my aunt and my cousin, while my sister and my dad had gone airport shopping.\n\nMy aunts phone started ringing and she picked it up, started speaking and almost as soon as she did, I just instantly knew that it was my grandpa (her dad) that had died. I knew before she knew. She started crying and I just sat there in complete shock because, for one it was the first death in my immediate family (from then on it went fast and that really messed with my head to the point where I mapped out my entire family-tree and just crossed names out as they died... tough time for my family) and also because I was just so baffled - how the hell did I know?\n\nThat's when my cousin turned to me and said: \"You know grandpa died right?\" All I could do was nod while choking up on tears. I'm not sure if my cousin had overheard the conversation or if she also just kinda knew.\n\nBefore having anybody tell me he was dead I went out to find my dad and sister and tell them the news. I never confirmed with my aunt because I was just 100% certain. In retrospect, I don't actually think that anybody ever told me my grandpa had died, apart from my cousin. I just always knew for some reason.\n\nBonus story (this may be more of a ghost-story than a glitch-in-the-matrix-story, but then again, who's to say ghosts aren't glitches in the matrix?):\n\nI've always loved having sleepovers at my grandmas house. One of the first times I ever slept there, after having been laying in bed for a couple hours, I went back into the living room: \"Grandma, grandma! There's a lady watching me in the bedroom!\"\n\nMy grandma, of course, became instantly worried and said: \"No way! I'll get her out!\" to which I replied: \"No, you don't have to, grandma. She's not here to hurt me. She just wants to watch.\"\n\nOf course, no physical beings were in the room but I kept on insisting she was there watching me, until at one point I told my grandma she had left.\n\nMy grandma drew the conclusion that it must've been her mother, my great grandma. She lived to hear about my mothers pregnancy with me, but passed a few shortly before I was born. In her last years, all she talked about and all she looked forward to, was getting great grandchildren. My mothers pregnancy had been the highlight of her last days. It would make sense that before crossing over, she'd want to come see me.\n\nOne day last year, I was at my grandmas house, and I noticed a picture that I hadn't seen before. \"Who's that?\" I asked. \"I remember seeing her as a kid but I don't think I've seen her for a long time?\"\n\n\"Oh that? That's your great grandma.\"\n\nTo this day I'm still carrying the little picture in my purse. I like to think that she's somehow watching over me and rooting for me through all my problems. At least, I think it makes sense to think about her a little bit, when she spent so much time thinking about me.",

When I woke, I sketched out a seating chart in my diary - which was kept for the sole purpose of seeing which dreams came true, looking up dream meanings, etc. \n\nThree years later, the boy that I had been dating when I had the dream died.

I actually burned it, with a lot of other belongings relating to the deceased. It was on the suggestion of a therapist (who I don't think ever quite believed me about the whole dream thing).

Towards the end of the evening everybody's pretty liquored up but people start to fragment as they go home or we lose them in a club when they are with other friends. At around 2:15am ish there's only two of the starting group remaining, Me and my Welsh friend Rhys. After a short while I finally decided to go get some food then go home. \n\n\nI arrive at my friend's chip shop around 2:20ish and stay there until it shuts around 3am, I then proceed straight home (about a 10 minute walk), quietly get in the house and finally get in bed next to my girlfriend who's been asleep for roughly 4 hours. Not one word was uttered and my phone had died.\n\nTypical night out, right?\n\nWell the following morning I get a phone call from my friend Coral to ask if me and my girlfriend are okay after I pocket dialed her and left a voicemail. The Voicemail consisted of me and my \"girlfriend\" screaming at each other over something, one bit consisted of calling Coral's friend a \"fucking ginger\" and various other pleasantries. \nNow you could say I was simply too drunk and I couldn't remember, which is understandable. So I asked my better half if we argued last night, of which she replied no, she didn't even notice me come to bed. After speaking back to Coral, she insists it was me and my girlfriend arguing and has saved the voicemail (which I'm going up to see at some point this week). I start thinking Coral might be confused and wondered if I argued with someone else, so I asked everyone I was out with if I argued with them or someone else. Every single person said no, I never argued with anybody that night. \n\nMy phone said I did call Coral around 2:25 when I was still in the last club, but my girlfriend was asleep at this point and quite a distance away. Coral insists it's obvious it was me and my girlfriend arguing and could not have been anyone else as names were mentioned, private information shared and so on. Another part of the argument was about a picture that supposedly was on Facebook of me and the \"ginger\" girl, of which there are no photo's on Facebook?\n\nThis might sound stupid to you guys, but i have no idea where this genuine voicemail from me came from. In my confused dazed (and after stalking this subreddit before) that maybe some wires/parallel universe momentarily crossed, one where I was arguing with my better half and accidentally pocket dialing my best friend. \n\nMy mind is utterly shafted, care to help guys?\n\n\n",

When we got inside, there was still half an hour or so until opening and there was nobody else in the building apart from me and her. \nAfter being in the building for about 3 minutes, the phone rang from an outside number. My manager answered, continued to have a confusing sounding conversation and then told me that it was the police calling to ask what our emergency was... Apparently they had received a phonecall from our number seconds before they called us. It was a female voice that only said \"police please\" and then hung up.\nNaturally we were really really confused because we'd been together since we got in the building and neither of us had been near a phone. There's about 6 phones in the store all together and only 2 of them can dial numbers that are outside, the rest of them only work internally. So anyway, my manager told the police that there's no emergency, they must have the wrong number etc. Minutes later a policeman showed up and insisted we show him around the store so he can check all the fire exits and see if there's anybody hiding anywhere. All clear. The entire time we were walking round, he was talking into his walky and they were repeating our telephone number. It was definitely our number that the call came from.\nThe whole thing seemed pretty fishy so we called our local police station afterwards to check that it was all legit. He was definitely a real police man, there was definitely an emergency call from our number and there was nobody in our store to have made the call. Whuuuut. ",

Well, the truth is there were quite a few entries mentioning a specific condition that I don't seem to have. I was apparently diagnosed with multiple personality disorder before I began my transition. Only now, there is only me here.\n\nMy doctor figures that for some reason unknown to any of us, my personalities all merged into one of the 3 non-dominant personalities. The cause for this is still up for debate, and I'm still being closely monitored in case new personalities develop. My mom was apparently very upset though, as I'm not quite the child that she raised, but I'm still apparently an amalgamation of those she remembers.\n\nThe false memories seem to be a part of this merger somehow. It's all very confusing and my doctor said it was some kind of coping mechanism from when I took control. In all honesty, I don't think he understands any better than I do, but the brain is still very much a mystery to us. He suggests that I read all of my old journals to try to help me separate the real past from my remembered past, and to meet with him more often just in case something splinters off or I somehow revert back to pre-merged status.\n\nI'll update again if anything really major happens, but you should consider this the last update from this throwaway.

My tv in my room is the same, my cable box, my computer, even my clothing. Everything is all the same, except for a few things I will get to soon.\n\nFirst thing I noticed, is that while my shirt is the same size, my chest is not. It's smaller than I remember. I look around for my favorite bra to confirm that they're smaller, and I notice that it too is a smaller size, but a perfect fit anyway. It seems I lost about a cup size overnight. Very weird, but I figure that maybe my mind is playing tricks on me. I grab a pair of jeans and head to the bathroom for my morning shower. That's when all Hell breaks loose on my psyche. I have a mother fucking penis! I certainly don't remember THAT being there last night. At this point, I start freaking out. I take a look into the bathroom closet and see a bunch of pill bottles that I don't quite remember. They are Spironolactone, Progesterone, and Estradiol. All of them have my name on them.\n\nIt's at this time I take a look in the mirror, I mean really take my first look, and see my face starting back. Only it's also not quite my face. It's different, but I can't tell how. I rush back to my room, bottles in hand, and do a quick Google to confirm what I thought those names on the bottles meant. They are hormones for male to female transition.\n\nMy mom, who I still live with, seems to already know all this about \"me\" and calls me by my name. My ID has my name on it too. I certainly don't remember being transgender last night, I even remember having my period last week and hating my uterus for those 3 long days. The only thing I can think of is that I am either trapped in a very odd dream, or I somehow shifted to another reality in which I was born male instead. But born male or not, it seems I'm still a woman.\n\nI just hope that as I go to sleep tonight, I wake back up in the body that I remember having. Though, maybe whoever I swapped with had their greatest dream come true. I just want to be me again though. This is too fucking weird for me, and I'm just glad I don't have a job here either to worry about so I can try to keep my sanity.\n\nEdit: Woke up, still here, very confused. It seems my primary Reddit account doesn't exist either. There are a few saved on this device though, I'll need to look into them further.",

Surely someone who was born in the late mid to late 80's isn't somehow stuck in the 70's.\n\nOkay, so it gets even more weird.  The car?  Brand fucking new.  It was spotless.  This is a 70's model mind you.  Maybe it's just garage kept and never driven.  But... Why was it being driven if that's the case?\n\nThe town I live in is very small, so small that if I see a vehicle I haven't seen before I will likely know that it's new to town, especially if the vehicle is unique.  \n\nThis guy looked like he'd literally rolled out of a portal from the 1970s and landed in 2014.\n\n",

We planned to meet in a bar -- that I had never been before, but vaguely could locate where it was. I took a wrong turn down a side street and was lost. \n\nThere was a record store that was open, so I decided to go inside and ask an employee for directions. When I asked whoever was behind the counter, they gave me an odd stare, and never answered me back. I thought it was strange, and I left. He was a strange character anyway, a ginger afro, and sporting flared jeans.\n\nAnyway, I eventually found my way to the bar, and I told my friend about this record shop. He was interested in going in, so I took him there. When we walked to the record store, the building was empty, the paint was old and peeling, and the brick walls were hidden by old, and torn posters.\nHe never believed me...\n\nDecided to go on Google maps to try and find the building. It's now a coffee shop called [Time Cafe](http://imgur.com/gYAOPRQ). Well, it's confirmed, I'm a character in a Stephen King novel.\n\nAlso, the street is right off Bold St in Liverpool, [a place notorious for people experiencing time slips.](http://www.parascience.org.uk/articles/time.htm) ",

A bigger SUV pulled up next to us and obscured my view of the guy on the bike, so I just figured I could watch and wait for him to come out from the other side when he crossed. He never did. I wanted to see if he'd make it across the road... but after a while of watching, our light turned green, and as we started going again I tried to look for the guy. He wasn't across the street, wasn't down the road.\n\nDude just straight up disappeared behind that SUV, I guess. Kinda weird.\n\n",

I remember thinking it was strange at the time, but I was re-telling the story to my girlfriend yesterday and I realized just how absurdly strange it really was, so I decided to post here.\n\nIt was 1994. I was with my mom, the 2 of us were running errands. First we went to the bank. The bank had these promotional fake kid dollars they called \"bear bucks\" that you got for making deposits and managing your money well and whatnot. You could spend them and get a toy. Anyway, I had been saving my bear bucks for like a year, and I spent them on a small toy basketball. I was happy, we left the bank and got in the car.\n\nNext stop, grocery store. We arrive at the old Alda grocery store and there's a radio station there today! The DJs have got a table set up and they're live on the radio. Now, this is a small town in the middle of nowhere Kansas, pop 6000, 30 mins from the nearest town with a wal-mart, so it's pretty unusual that there'd be a radio station in this grocery store.\n\nSo here's the weird part: We walk up to the radio people and there's a 1/2 size little indoor free-standing basketball hoop they're giving away. To 6 year old me, it was the coolest thing ever. They say if you make a shot, you take it home! What timing, on our part. Only thing is... they don't have a ball. They ask me, son do you have a small basketball with you by any chance? \n\nAnd well, I did, in the car. From the bank. I went and got it, made the shot on live radio, and won the hoop. I had it for about a 5 years there afterwards and had a lot of fun with it as a kid.\n\nBut what are the odds of:\n\n1. The radio station being at the grocery store we went to and having a giveaway in this small town, at one of the crappier grocery stores\n\n2. Having gone to the bank just prior and spent all my bear bucks I'd been saving a year on a 1/2 size miniature basketball\n\n3. Them _not having a ball for the promotional event they were conducting_, and me having _exactly_ the right size and type of ball needed.\n\n4. Me making the shot and winning the hoop.\n\n\nIsn't that fucking weird as all get out? Makes me feel like I'm on the damn Truman Show or something. Or that this universe is a video game designed for me to experience. It just seems so strange that something like that would happen. I'm always the type of person who chalks these things up to luck or probability, but what are the odds of this weird story?! Perhaps I'm over-selling it, but that really feels like a glitch in the matrix if I've ever seen one. ",

It's a small gap that I can see through, but it allows me to see the visual cue for when the machine is done while I am at the computer. My setup has been like this for weeks and works very well for me. \n\nFast forward to tonight: I've been at work for 3-4 hours and I see the light go on. I run the machine through it's sequence, load the pallets and sit back down at the computer. I do my thing and look back over a couple minutes later. My little slot that I've looked through for the past few weeks is now gone. It occurs to me that the CNC machine closest to me is in a place that I would've NEVER seen the light to begin with. It's out of place by at least three feet and it would've been impossible for me to ever see. \n\nUnderstandably, my mind is completely blown and I walk around the shop looking for clues. The control box panel didn't move. The shelving didn't move. The CNC machines certainly didn't move, as they weigh over 10,000lbs a piece. I look from the lights point of view and it is seriously impossible how I would've ever seen it to begin with. I would've been looking straight at a panel on the CNC machine. The computer has always been against the wall and that certainly didn't move. One second I could see everything, and the next moment, I can't.\n\n\n\nWTF happened? I'm seriously lost. ",

I'm always embarrassed when people ask me about it because I fear that they might be making judgment calls on me - kinda like how people joke about the Chinese symbol tattoos. Anyways, I swear this ring has an affinity to me, so I'm still wearing it 10 years later. \n\nI purchased the ring when I was about 14 years old. I was an angsty teenager and felt that this Celtic ring somehow tied me to my grandfather who lived several states away. He isn't Irish, nor does he have any particular interest in Celtic cultures. He's actually from Wyoming. I think I just liked the ring more than anything. \n\nI ended up living with my grandparents when I was 16, and stayed with them for one school year. That fall, I misplaced my Celtic ring and was mildly upset about it. In the spring, after the snow melted, my grandpa found the ring in the backyard. Not anything super cool, just a story of a ring that was lost and then found. \n\nFast forward 4 years. I was 20 and had lost my Celtic ring yet again in a move, and hadn't thought of it in about 2 or 3 years. I was getting into my car one day after class and noticed something silver in the passengers seat. Low and behold, my ring was setting there, waiting for me to find it. The really weird thing is that it was a new car, and I wasn't wearing any clothing the ring could have been hiding in for the last 3 years. It literally just appeared out of thin air. I was the only person who ever drove the car, so it wasn't some kind of weird joke. I explained it to my family and they even thought the appearance was kind of strange. \n\nOnly one logical explanation in my mind: \n\nTl;dr Confused about my own identity, I may be Frodo. ",

        "text": "Hello people, \n\nI have had some strange experiences I would like to share! I just found this subreddit and I find it very interesting. I thought a good topic to discuss would be Déjà vu. Because it has always been quite scary for me.\n\nWhen I was younger, whenever I got Déjà vu I would always feel as if I knew what was going to happen next, and a lot of the time, I tested it. and weirdly, it would always be right. Something as simple as, if I were talking to someone at the time, I would repeat in my head what I thought they were going to say next, and then they would say it. \n\nI would just carry on as normal... play along... kind of thing. And I always thought that was normal as a kid, then as I got older, I heard more about it and I heard that a lot of people just feel a \"ooo this feels like it happened before.\" kind of thing, not the actual \"play along because I know what happens\" aspect of it. \n\nAfter a while, whenever it happened I would always do something opposite to what I thought was supposed to happen. Because I thought, why should I play along? Whenever I could disturb it, I would. I would cut off there sentence or if it was a \"I do this, then they react this way\" kind of thing, I would just not do my part and so they wouldn't react the way it seemed it was \"supposed to\". \n\nStrangely... after that, as if I was \"messing things up\" whenever I tried to guess, I would actually be wrong. I would wait it out and something different would happen. and for a while, that was satisfying. \n\nI stopped trying to mess things up on purpose and then it started syncing again. I'm 19 now, and I just play along now because it's a strange yet satisfying feeling to be right, if that makes sense?\n\nBut obviously I can't help but wonder, what IS Déjà vu and why do people get it? what are YOUR thoughts on it? your experiences? \nI mean, there is a theory of reincarnation, right? but what if we just start again, and play the same life over and over, and Déjà vu is our consciousness recognising that, even if its just for a split second?\n\nI don't get Déjà vu very often, but sometimes I get random outbursts of having it quite close together, and when it happens, it's a very very strange feeling.\n\nThis whole thing may seem like bull, but I can promise you it isn't, it genuinely really gets me thinking about certain philosophical theory's I have heard. When I was little, I remember asking myself in my head, \"What if there is no other real people, what if I'm the only real person and everyone else is just made up. I know that I can feel, I know that I can think. But the people I talk to, I don't know for sure it they are real.

        "text": "This happened only a couple of months ago, and I almost had to get a roommate exchange because it frightened me so badly. Normal Saturday morning, I'm lying in bed, surfing the internet, just generally being a lazy college Freshman. It's about 11:30 or so, and my roommate jumps up from his bed, slips on a hoodie, grabs his keys and tells me he's going to go grab some breakfast from the cafeteria. I see him step outside and close the door, and a few seconds after, I settle back into my browsing. A few minutes pass, and I hear the bathroom door in our dorm click open, and out pads my roommate, wearing a towel, looking fresh out of the shower.\nI was dumbfounded. Probably pale as a ghost, because he asked me if I was feeling okay. I... shook it off, maybe thinking I had gotten so engrossed in my browsing, that I'd lost track of time and just hadn't noticed him coming back. He pads back into the bathroom for some reason, and I look at the clock on my computer. It's only 11:45. I still shake it off, thinking that I had just imagined him leaving to get food.\nBut then, after a couple more minutes, I hear the signature sound of a key opening our dorm door, and there's my roommate- in the same hoodie he put on when he left, hair dry, with a to-go box full of food from the cafeteria. It was about 11:50. I jolted up, ran to the bathroom to check if he was in there- nothing. The shower wasn't wet, there was no fog in the bathroom.\nI had to leave for the rest of the day I was so unsettled. I became so uncomfortable around him, I almost broke down and had to switch roommates. I'm still uneasy around him, and I still can't explain what happened.\n\nI'm fairly sure I was awake when this happened, as I vividly remember the rest of the day and going to sleep that night in a friends dorm and waking up there the next morning. I don't use drugs or alcohol, so I'm sure I wasn't hallucinating either. But, I really can't explain it. It still disturbs me to my core.",

        "text": "So this took place a few weeks back and I've been thinking about it ever since. \n\nA good friend and I decided to take LSD for the first time because we had researched it and were pretty curious. So fast forward to about two hours after we each took one tab and I was tripping absolute ballsack. We had roamed around outside and marveled at everything, but I decided I wanted to sit down and just think. After a few minutes of contemplating, I was seriously on the verge of losing touch with the world. I was pondering the origin of the universe, parallel universes and higher dimensions, whether or not human consciousness is biologically dependent or if it exists as part of the universe. I even felt like I was starting to understand it all too. How consciousness and the multiverse was all intimately connected. I was thinking about some truly reality shattering things that I can no way explain in words, and to this day I am still in awe at the amazing power of LSD. \n\nAnyway, I start to freak myself out by thinking I will lose touch with reality. I decide to stop thinking and get back to the \"real\" world. I pull out my phone and proceed to go on instagram to get my head back on straight. The first post on the feed says \"good reads tonight :)\" and is a page from \"The 48 Laws of Power\". I immediately begin reading a random sentence in the middle of the page. It read as following \"It is a labyrinth--your mind becomes consumed with solving its infinite problems, and you soon realize how lost you have become. Do not be frivolous with such critical matter. The gods of power frown on the frivolous; they give ultimate satisfaction on those who study and reflect, and punish those who skim the surface looking for a good time.\"\n\nI was horrified at how much this quote related to what I was thinking of just seconds before, and how this randomly chosen excerpt from a full page was literally the first thing I see immediately after having these thoughts. I'm not a spiritual or religious type of person, but I honestly don't know if I should take this as a sign of some sort or if it was just one hell of a coincidence. ",

        "text": "So to cut out any confusion, let me start off by saying I havent talked to my friend in like 3 weeks. Hes working on a film because hes going to school for animation. Throwaway because this shit is fucking weird ok.\n\nAnyways, last night I was sleeping and I dreamt of for some reason walking into his house after sleeping outside in the cold icy weather, eating some food in his fridge, then going over to his computer, and for some odd reason he had like 12 monitors/hdtvs just laying around, and a huge widescreen monitor hooked up to his actual computer. Then i was walking around his room and I just remember taking a look at this broken HDTV with a panel hanging off the bottom with soil and grass sticking out. It kinda looked like it'd been hooked up to a pickup and dragged across a field of grass.\n\nI thought it was a pretty weird dream, but I always have had super vivid dreams. I used to even suffer from sleep paralysis and only up until recently its stopped. I've done what I can only describe as walking out of my body from my bed at least 3 times, feeling extremely lethargic and in that scary sleep paralysis state. Anyways, getting side tracked.\n\nDecided to message my friend in question on steam and to tell him about how fucking weird my dream was and how it was about him, and then he responds with this:\n\n\n2:55 PM - R: Woooaaah that's so trippy. I'm actually working on a project film where this kid steals monitors, and tries to refurbish them, but when he can't he just uses them as pots for growing plants! THAT'S FUCKED DUDE.\n\n\nGave me chills, shits fucking weird man. I've experimented with medium sized doses of DXM recently, and I smoke pot once in a while. But last time I tripped on DXM I was really convinced that there is more to everything in this universe than just us. I saw what looked like day to day lives of people around the world from asian countries, all the way to small villages out in the middle of nowhere. Not that any of this is related to it, but it reminded me of the vivid dream I had last night, where things were intricate, and not just a blurry dark dream, I could feel and see things in clear detail.\n\nI don't know reddit, you guys be the judge.

One night during last summer, I was walking home from my friend's house. It's about a 10 minute walk from my house, and you have to cross a main road of sorts. It's two lanes, but has traffic lights and such, and basically cuts my suburb in half. Anyway, I was walking out of a residential street on my friend's side of the main road, planning to cross. As I reached the corner, I saw a girl walking on the other side of the street. She was about my age at the time, 16, and very attractive (at least to me). She was about 5'3\", average weight, killer legs, dark brown or maybe black hair, tanner-than-average skin, wearing a black tank top and black cotton shorts, the stretchy ones with the elastic waist. Considering how beautiful I thought she was, I started planning how I was going to start a conversation with her. So, as I crossed the street I prepared to say something friendly as we crossed paths, and she fell out of my sight as I walked behind a tree or telephone pole. As I reached the point where we should have met, I paused in disbelief. She wasn't there. I was shocked as I started to look around for places she could have gone for the 2 seconds I lost sight of her. I thought maybe she was startled that I crossed the street and it was dark out, or maybe lived on that street and went into her house, but I realized that I would have seen her change direction or enter her home. I stood there for about 5 minutes stunned. Nothing like this had ever happened to me before. Has anyone had a similar encounter? It didn't SCARE me, but I was definitely shocked. She was just gone.",
