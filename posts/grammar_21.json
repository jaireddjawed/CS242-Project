In which he stated, “Oh ok…grammar saves lives.” So I asked him to elaborate as I believed my statement to be accurate, and said actually context saves lives. I am open to being corrected. \n\nHe stated that, “Technically the correct way is I got a shot for coved number 4” Which is.. Not correct, so I replied and  said at that point it’s adding context, I could of said “I got the fourth shot.”  and added “Yet the fourth pig is still pig #4” (pig was just the first noun i thought of)\n\nHe replied yea but that is putting the object before the number. I don’t think that should matter, i think he just misunderstood my original post. \n\nSo my question is, what is the grammatical term to define the difference between the two statements?",

Honestly, both D and E do not have a conjunction to connect these 2 clauses. The only difference between D and E is **paralyzed vs being paralyzed.** \n\nA) Two -ings (having and being) make it sound awkward\n\nB) Keep it for now. (preposition?)\n\nC) Sounds wordy ( ,that paralyzed..)\n\nD) Past tense. No conjunction to connect two clauses\n\nE) Present participle. Independent clause has past tense. Not parallel?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCan someone explain why D is the correct answer? And is my logic for each choice valid?",
