The wage increase for the avg workers would be revolutionary.  Plus most exec's operate on emotional decisions, ie...save ourselves and fuck everyone else.  I know workers take pride in their work, exec's do everything in their power to maintain their personal income with no regard to the profitability of the company.

        "text": "Earlier in the year, Dall-E mini released and people thought it was silly, quirky new tech that was far from ever being useful. Behind the scenes though, the real concept of machine learning generated art was being worked on and already creating amazing things. \n\nThen Stable Diffusion dropped and out of nowhere this concept of AI generated art became open source, and instead of weird abstract nonsense we had access to earlier in the year, the public could suddenly either use their beefy gaming computers, or sub to something like NovelAI to generate just about anything they could think of. Want a Charizard fighting optimus prime? Easy. Want to turn your original doodle you drew as a kid into a marvel character? Totally possible. \n\nThis has, of course, caused a massive uprising in the art community. The argument being that these models are stealing their work. It also simultaneously threatens their livlihoods, as a good chunk of people that might have commissioned a piece will generate it instead. Not everyone of course, but a large amount. Meanwhile, corporations around the world are salivating at the idea of generating art assets in the future and saving money on employing actual artists. It would only be logical with how cheap these products already are. \n\nI don't think the artists themselves are going to be successful in stopping this tech. It's already out there being used, and there isn't really an art lobby to defend them over companies like Adobe who will of course implement this into their products. What about corporations defending their IP's though? The concept of \"Fan art\" has always been a gray area, and production was low enough that most companies never did anything about it. Will Disney or other traditionally litigious companies step in this time around now that you can pop a prompt in there and generate hundreds of images of Mickey Mouse doing unspeakable things to other Disney characters? Will western governments step in and put a stop to the tech altogether to protect jobs? Or will we see the corporate world push to make it a thing for maximum profits? \n\nI'm so fascinated by it all. Watching the debates on Twitter and various reddit posts here is enlightening. The AI learns similar to how a human would by referencing other people and building its own work based on what it knows. Do we hold it to a different standard than a human artist because it's an program that can do what we do at superspeed? Or is it just doing what everyone has done since the first caveman slapped a stick figure antelope on a cave wall and called it art?",

        "text": "Technology is great, science is great, it's progress is magnificent but not everything is good, if we are not carefull technology will be used for bad. All the optimism can be a dangerous thing and human nature is wild and sometimes evil.\n\nWith everything so connected and tracked (specially information) it is easier than ever to control things and how are we sure these powers won't be abused, because the goverment is so good and will never do something againts it's people? capitalism is about sharing? people are good?\n\nI swear the conept of evil some people have is the movie villians or whoever has a different opinion than them but no. Real people, without any empathy or emotions exist, people that would sell fellow people for profit and even just for fun. Try to meet psychopaths in real life (and not the series or movies made about them), evil people exist, the world isn't about ideals or justice, real life is hard and cruel and as you know the people at the top aren't rightous paladins of good, no, at the top of the food chain sits the apex predators, the worst of the worst.\n\nJust looking at history and even on our actual world if someone has power it is really likely to be abused. For example, chinese people obey their goverment because they think it is the right thing, their orwellian social credit system was sold with good intentions but it ends up with everybody being goverment cattle. How are we sure somethign like this will never happen on the rest of the world? because the companies, goverments and media tell us that won't happen?\n\nAI can leave the great majority of people without how to earn a living, virtually useless and without meaning on their lives. No daddy god goverment isn't going to give you free money of the good of their hearts to do art (AI already does art better, faster and free) and if it does more than not it will be under something like the social credit system where everything is about obeying absurd stuff. Every time people depended on their goverment for a living, it became a god like tyrant (always in the name of the people and the greater good). People become cattle that obeys and follows whatever the goverment tells them, it has happened every time and we aren't better than the people of the past only easier to manipulate.\n\nDigital money is beautiful, a comfortable and useful miracle but if it is used to control what can people buy or not (or who can buy or not) it is not so good.\n\nHealing chronic diseases may be possible but why would anybody do that if keeping people dependant is so much better, maybe it would be even better to make diseases for money or control\n\nthere are many advances that I ignore or don't know, these are just examples\n\nTechnology is good but it can be misused and chances are it will be. The abuse of anything is always disguised and justified with good intentions. The world wild and cruel, people aren't good.\n\nThe chances of heading to a dystopia are much, much bigger than heading to a utopia\n\n(I'm not american so I apologize for mispelling or if things aren't clear)",

Current price is $16.8k.\n\nIn altcoins, the biggest winner in 24 hours has been XDC (+4.5%), with LEO the biggest loser (-5.5%). Crypto sentiment remains bearish due to both wider macro sentiment (i.e. interest rates) as well as crypto specific issues related to Centralised Exchange stability - particularly given the Auditors of Binance and other exchanges pulled out of completing Crypto audits on Friday.",
