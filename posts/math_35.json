This year I wish to partake again, however school has been pretty stressful and, on top of that, looking at last year's scores, I feel like I am just so out of reach of any even slightly noteworthy place (like even 10th place, for instance). In a sense, I feel I am not smart enough - not good enough - it is quite discouraging. I love math and do think I can do something perhaps remarkable but whenever I wish to prepare for said contest, these thoughts of 'inferiority' usually pop up in my mind and I end up doing something else. My question is, as the title impies (I hope!), if even the smarter mathenaticians need to practice, exercise and so on in order to remain good at math or if I'm just at a sort of eternal disadvantage when it comes to competitions.",

The lecturer (while I'm sure he knows his stuff) is a really old, terrible teacher. All I have to learn from are his recorded lecture videos in which he babbles endlessly about how easy this stuff is and that \"graduates never truly get it because they're lazy and want to take shortcuts\".\n\nI've asked him for help but he's practically useless. I can't find materials online that are at all similar to what we're doing and I've developed incredible anxiety as my exam is in two weeks and I feel like I know nothing.\n\nIf anyone could guide me to where I could receive help or materials for this unit I'd be immensely grateful. I'd even be interested in paying for tutoring services if there's anyone who's capable of teaching this content. \n\nThankyou\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIncase its of help, this is the full structure for the unit's content:\n\n**1. Mathematical Preliminaries**\n\n (a) Brief revision of Fourier Series and PDE work. Convergence issues. Improvement of convergence. (b) Sturm-Liouville Theory \n\n(c) Series solutions for ODE’s. Singularities \n\n(d) Asymptotics vs convergent expansions \n\n(e) Some Perturbation work: integral evaluations, WKJB (f) PDE types, classification of 2nd order PDE’s \n\n**2. Diffusion: Fundamental Plane Source Solution** \n\n(a) Scaling in the Heat Context, similarity ideas \n\n(b) Fundamental Solutions \n\n(c) Boundary Integral techniques (surface heating) \n\n(d) Change in state (freezing, detonation) \n\n**3. Variational Formulations and Finite Elements** \n\n(a) Hamilton’s principle vs Newtonian formulation \n\n(b) The effect of shape on cooling/cooking \n\n(c) Finite element, Galerkin technique \n\n**4. Waves** \n\n(a) Very brief revision of modal decomposition, dispersion. \n\n(b) Nonlinear waves; traffic flow \n\n**5. The Greenhouse Problem**",
