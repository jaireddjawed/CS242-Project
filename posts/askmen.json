[{"title":"BONK! Overly sexual questions are no longer allowed.","author":"ExplosiveMachine","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskMen\/comments\/wyk8lz\/bonk_overly_sexual_questions_are_no_longer_allowed\/","text":"Sup horndogs!\n\nIt came to our attention that the collective mind has drifted too far into the gutter. And no not that kind of \"came\", for fucks sake. We've received many complaints from the community that the questions in this subreddit have gotten increasingly horny, and honestly I agree. See? And you fuckers say we don't listen. It's not that we don't, it's that we don't give a fuck, except when shit gets really bad.\n\nThere are only so many times a person can read about why buttsex is so popular or what the best position is or what was the freakiest sex, before succumbing to unclean thoughts themselves, which is not what Jesus would want from us.\n\nThat's why automoderator has been purposefully sexually repressed in order to harbour a healthy hatred towards all things horny. Honestly, you're on fucking reddit, it's full of porn as it is. If you want to read people make sexy shit up, go to \/r\/AskRedditAfterDark, that's where all the other teenagers are. Or a billion of other bad erotica subs. \n\nA side effect of sending you all to horny jail is that some pretty \"general\" words were added to the filter so if your question gets removed for something that is not horny, send us a modmail. Should say so in the removal comment anyway, but who reads those am I right??\n\nThere is also a report reason available if some bodily fluids still manage to drip past the filter if you get what I mean. Remember, only you can prevent ~~forest fires~~ horny shitposts.\n\nAnyway, that is all, remember to read the Bible (or regional equivalent) and keep your gonads in your pants. Clean is mean or some shit.\n\nPeace","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1661547912.0},{"title":"Suicide is the leading cause of death in men from ages 25-34, what can we do to change this?","author":"Ok-Significance9390","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskMen\/comments\/11paotk\/suicide_is_the_leading_cause_of_death_in_men_from\/","text":"The more I research the more fucked it is.

After a month of 2 after chatting daily, he asked me out, and I agreed.\n\nWe met up for a few days, and after the first day we couldn't keep our hands to ourselves. We slept together obviously but we also held hands and cuddled whenever we could. Our body language just matched, so to say. It matched very well.\n\nAfter I left we kept on chatting every day, and he asked me to visit again soon, he made a joke about me moving in with him, and hinted at wanting children with me. [In a light hearted way that matched the converation we had at that moment, not as creepy as it might sound]\n\nUnfortunately, a few days ago he told me that he didn't want a long distance relationship after all. It hurt too much according to him. I was definitely the kind of woman he was looking for, and he obviously liked me, but he had some bad experiences with long distance, although he was really tempted to try it again with me. It took him months to make up his mind about it.\n\nHe never asked for nudes or other things of that kind, and the time I did ask him if I could visit again he asked me to wait. He told me later that he wanted to be sure about everything before something like that would happen, because that would mean we would automatically have entered the 'relationship' status.\n\nAfter \"the talk\" he asked me if we could stay friends. I agreed. We have interesting conversations, bounce ideas off each other and we can banter. We still send each other messages throughout the day. We also agreed that I would visit him this summer to see a show near him I wanted to see.\n\n~\n\nHow much chance has this to actually work?\n\nI am still in the poisonous mindset that I am hoping that when we will meet up things will happen again, and that this time he will choose to give it a shot. I am terribly confused at the moment, and I don't think I can judge this situation in a reasonable manner.\n\nThanks for reading this.","upvote_ratio":0.43,"created_utc":1678485087.0},{"title":"Why do people say they\u2019re \u201cgrateful\u201d you brought up something that bothered you that they said?","author":"castlegrass277","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskMen\/comments\/11nvxiq\/why_do_people_say_theyre_grateful_you_brought_up\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.43,"created_utc":1678470954.0},{"title":"What made you realize how much stronger you are than women?","author":"LittleFirTree","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskMen\/comments\/11o8jfw\/what_made_you_realize_how_much_stronger_you_are\/","text":"Edit: *physically stronger","upvote_ratio":0.36,"created_utc":1678502307.0},{"title":"Folks who grew up in the country, what was the hardest part of adjusting to city-life?","author":"J0E_Blow","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskMen\/comments\/11nvvby\/folks_who_grew_up_in_the_country_what_was_the\/","text":"People who moved from rural areas to cities or vice versa..

If we're in a meeting he does include me but is not overly friendly about it and barely looks at me. I am polite and respectful and try to be friendly, and pretend I'm oblivious.

During this time I've been through therapy and have worked on improving myself. Recently, I finally started a dating app account, but the idea of a relationship terrifies me. While I understand that it will take time, patience, and at least a couple of attempts before things calm down, I keep asking myself if I'm just not ready yet, or if I need to get through this awkward and stressful part.

I was brought up in a messy house and never got into good habits of cleaning and tidying. This wasn't so bad when I was younger and I just lived in a disorganised, messy room, didn't clean and just did a quick tidy when I was having someone over. I didn't really notice or care although I probably annoyed some housemates along the way. \n\nAnyway now I'm older and live with women and find myself in the shitty sexist habit of frequently just leaving things to them by not taking responsibility for my environment at all. My partner's been ill recently and simultaneously needs the house clean to help with her allergies and also can't afford the energy to do it herself so my slacking has become particularly problematic. \n\nIntellectually I'd like to be the sort of person who sees something left out on the side or on the floor or that needs cleaning and just *does it*, but I'm not in the habit of noticing or realising it's actually my job to fix it\n\nSo has anyone got any advice for starting to take equal responsibility for tidying and I guess just shaking off a lifetime of domestic sexism and laziness?
