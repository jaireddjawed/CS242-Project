        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badlinguistics/comments/3ho21v/this_comment_from_a_tetchy_saloncom_article_about/",
        "text": "For context, [here is the article.](http://www.salon.com/2013/08/22/according_to_the_dictionary_literally_now_also_means_figuratively_newscred/)\n\n&gt; I desired to refine this, to remove some typo's, clarify some statements, etc.  There is some timer on editing, not starting an edit, but finishing it. So, I am posting my edited version.\n\n\n\n&gt;The acceptable meaning of words is not defined by the misuse of woefully ignorant people, no matter how many of them misuse it.  The meaning of words is defined by the group of people, generally professionals, who's purvue encompasses the terminology.  This cannot be more important than it is today as communication, and the potential for abuse, is at the spead and scope of the internet.\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;The dictionary does not simply document.  It certainly does perscribe. These are not mutually exlusive as they do not occur simultaneously.  The dictionary is part of a feedback loop that stabilizes language.  It documents word usage then perscribes that usage.\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;It is constantly used to perscribe, with far more frequency than the misuse of the word \"literally\".  To the person that stated it otherwise; if the reasoning for the definitional change to \"literally\" is how it is popularly used then that same reasoning applies to how the dictionary is popularly used, to perscribe. This paradox requires a resolution which can only be that the dictionary perscibes the meaning of the word \"literally\" because it the dictionary is literally used to perscribe.\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;The dictionary documents and perscribes the meaning of words primarily as used by people that bother to use the dictionary.  The audience of the dictionary is not the volumous ignorant masses that ignore the dictionary.  By their very behavior, they preclude themselves from defining the use of the dictionary and the meaning of the word \"literally\".\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;No matter how the general population uses the word \"mile\", it does not change the meaning of the word \"mile\".  The definition of a mile is 5280 feet. It is a proffessionaly defined term.  It may be used figuratively to mean \"a long distance\" but that will never change the proper meaning of 5280 feet.  And it certainly will never be equivalent to \"kilometer\", a measure that it is distinctly defined as not being.  The definition of \"mile\" includes it being not an inch, foot, angstrom, kilometer, or any other unit of measure.  Part of the definition of \"literally\" is \"not figuratively\".  \n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;What is at issue here isn't the meaning of \"literally\". What is at issue is the dictionary's ill defined proccess for documenting and perscribing terms. This issue has become highlighted in adding an inappropriate definition of \"figuratively\" which it so obviously cannot mean, no matter how many times it is improperly used by people who don't bother to read the dictionary.",

It has given me a unique insight in these three languages and the relationships between them.\n \nI am fascinated by your Lexical Root Theory approach. I feel excited and reënergized because it matches the thoughts that I was forming over the course of my studies. I also see a lot in common between Arabic and Basque and am interested in Lexical Root Theory's applicability in finally solving the mystery of the origin of Basque language. Do you have any thoughts on the Arabic origin of Basque? \n\nBest regards,\nJim\n\n___\n\nDidn't check this email account for days. When I remembered again, there were two emails from him.\n\n___\n\n**From: Zaidan Jassem**\n\n2/20/14\n\nDear Mr Power,\n\nThank you very much for your highly appreciated feedback and enquiry about whether I know anything about the Arabic origins of Basque. Unfortunately, I don't because all the etymological references I use are for Indo-European languages (Harper 2013). I know that Basque is an isolate in a European linguistic ocean and I haven't delved further than that. I think I've heard sometime somewhere that there is a relationship between it and Berber in Morocco but since you're studying it rigorously, you should know better than me. I also know that there is a relationship between Berber and Arabic- how much, how deep I can't tell. I would be as fascinated as you are with its application to Basque, which I've already called for in my research. For example, I found glimpses of relationship between Arabic and Japanese, which I referred to in Jassem (2013l) where the pronoun anta 'you- nom.' in Arabic is the same in Japanese with two forms anta/anata (the paper is the only one in Arabic this time, presented and published in a Conference in Indonesia, which can be downloaded from my account in academia.edu. I also found relationships with other far eastern languages. I'm planning to tackle that soon.\n\nIn a nutshell, I'll be looking forward to seeing you having established a connection between Basque, English and Arabic. That's going to be revolutionary, I think, which will take linguistics into new directions in bringing not only languages but also peoples together for the common good of humanity. My latest paper on Question Words (Jassem 2014) might be of help in this connection,\n\nKeep in touch and good luck to you in your research and future career.\n\nWassalam \n\n**From: Zaidan Jassem**\n\n2/20/14\n\nDear Jim,\n\nI've just searched some internet sites about Basque. Verb to be is izan 'to be', you is zu, the woman is emakuema, etc. \n\nTherefore on the basis of verb to be and the pronoun, I think it is definitely Arabic because izan is sein in German which is kan/yakoon in Arabic where /k/ became /s/, a process known as kaskasa in Arabic. zu is the same as German Sie 'you', Old English ge (you) from Arabic iaka where /k/ became /z/, kaskasa again.\n\n**Therefore, in light of these two pieces of evidence, which are the heart of the language, Basque is related to English, German, and Arabic. The lexical root theory captures the genetic link very easily.**\n\n**I wish you focus your study in in one of these directions- It's MA you do not need much. In short, Basque is Arabic in origin as all European languages.** \n\nHope this will help in solving the mystery if not solving it indeed. I'll leave the rest to you.\n\nBye for now.\n\nWassalam\n\n___\n\nCrazy ideas, but, I was touched by his professorly advice and concern. I felt bad but I was too high on the fact that the seed had been planted and that he was engaging with the topic. I couldn't help being an even bigger ass.\n\n___\n\n**From Jim Power**\n\n2/26/14\n\nHello Dr. Jassem,\n\nI apologize for the delay - I had blocked all email and social media for my midterms. \n\nThis is very exciting. I showed this to my professor and he is very intrigued as well. My institute encourages collaboration with other researchers. Would you like to work together on this? Since you saw the connections, you can get another paper out of this, and you could assign some tasks to me to research. Let me know your thoughts.\n\nWassalam,\n\nJim\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/oaXwHpu.png\n\n**From: Zaidan Jassem**\n\n2/28/14\n\nDear Jim,\n\nWelcome back and hope you did well in your midterms. Yes, we can collaborate on this soon. I thought I'd leave it entirely for you as you're specializing in the subject. I did not want to jump over into your boat. \nAnyway, as this is your wish, we can do that together. \n\nBut I need to know your University and  your professor. Maybe I know about him already.   We can collaborate personally and institutionally. On a personal level, there's no redtape; we can start immediately. Institutionally, my University is very interested in collaborating with international institutions in the UK and USA in particular as well as all European universities because they have adopted a Quality Assurance and Accreditation System according to which international collaboration is a prerequisite. I can suggest your Institute to them and you negotiate matters together such as student exchange, programme development, teacher training, study leaves. This might take some time but universities are in no hurry.  We have a new head who just got his PhD from the UK; he's an Arabist and should be very interested to follow it through; also the Dean is interested too. In fact, all the University authorities are.  \n\nLet me know as soon as you can so I can put it before the Head  on Sunday where we have our weekly Departmental meeting. This information is for institutional collaboration; for myself, we don't need to go through such routine. I'll suggest a topic soon.\n\nBest regards.\nWassalam  \n\n___\n\nJackpot! At this time, I started dreaming about getting to work on a topic that I love and getting to publish a paper on that topic.  I got some good people here interested in taking this to the next level. I even started looked for templates for website for my fake university. However, conscience won out and I felt like a huge ass. Also, it would have been fraud, literally. I decided to end it:\n\n___\n\n**From: Jim Power**\n\n3/07/14\n\nHello,\n\nI don't know how to say this. \n\nI am very embarrassed to have to tell you this but I have just been suspended from my institute because of substance abuse. I will not be able to complete my studies. I had some major struggles in my life and found refuge in smoking crack. I am disappointed in myself and have left everyone who believed in me down.\n\nI am very sorry. Thank you for being a positive influence in a difficult period of my life. Please continue to work on this idea on your own. \n\nJim\n\n____\n\n____\n\n**EDIT**\n\nOh shit, oh shit, oh shit... I just found this. It looks like he continued to work on it on his own:\n[The Arabic Origins of \"Basque and Finnish Pronouns\": A Radical Linguistic Theory Approach](https://www.academia.edu/7845885/The_Arabic_Origins_of_Basque_and_Finnish_Pronouns_A_Radical_Linguistic_Theory_Approach)\n\nI feel dirty and accomplished.
