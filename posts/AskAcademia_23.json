        "text": "Hi all! I am interested in academia and I want to try applying for one in my final year (about 2 years from now hopefully). However, I constantly feel unwise because the general consensus of most places I have been to, like this subreddit, is about the negative aspects of academia and how saturated the job market is (with which I wholeheartedly agree). Part of the reason is also that I am a Ph.D. student in statistics and there are many lucrative job opportunities out there in the industry. I don't completely ignore those negative aspects, especially when I am witnessing some of them myself, and I also aim for also applying for industry jobs and decide what works best according to the offers I have. It is just that I have a bit preference for academia so I really want to give it a try.\n\nI understand that this is a bit against popular opinion, but I wonder if anyone has some insights on how to stay motivated and overcome the unwise feeling. Thank you so much.",

        "text": " Hello,\n\nI recently completed a STEM PhD and have two job offers. One is a post-doc position with the regular nih stipend in a very high cost of living area. The other is a staff scientist position (in a much cheaper area but at an equally good university) where I will be doing computational work for a couple of labs and the salary would be almost 70-80% higher. The PIs have also assured me that I may be able to get a first or co-first authorship as a staff scientist and would be able to have a project of my own.  To me the second offer looks like an obvious choice. It is pretty much the same work as a postdoc but with almost double the pay. \n\nMy question is that if in future I apply for tenure track positions, would it be a big negative that I was a staff scientist as opposed to a postdoc? I feel the probability of getting first author publications is equal in either position (and obviously not guaranteed in either). Only the postdoc pays half the salary for the same work. \n\nWould skipping the posdoc really hurt my chances of getting tenure track positions?\n\nThanks",

        "text": "Wanted some feedback on a potentially awkward situation. \n\nI'm junior faculty and work closely with a research institution in my field. We have a lot of student researchers who tend to go on to apply for post-grad programs, fellowships, etc). I recently received an email from someone I know very slightly asking me about one of our students, B. The person contacting me, let's call them A, is not someone I know that well: we've met a few times at a conference, but is in charge of applications for a prestigious and competitive fellowship. A disclosed to me 'in confidence' that the student B had applied for the fellowship and asked if I could share any feedback about them \"off the record\" and offered to do a phone call instead of email. The email heavily implied that they had no issue with the student B's professional accomplishments, but more to do with other qualities (think age, gender, etc: stuff that should not be a factor in this decision-making process, in my opinion). \n\nAlthough I didn't know that the student B had applied to this particular place, B had chatted with me about her applications and sought some general advice on writing application letters and essays, during which I had seen some of her drafts and given her some feedback on how to improve them. I also happened to know that the student B had asked the head of our institute to act as a reference for all her applications and that the head had agreed, so I couldn't understand why they weren't talking directly to the head. This is especially because the student B actually worked closely with the head of the institution for a year on a project, but didn't work directly with me at all. We knew each other mostly because we worked at the same place at the same time, but I never supervised or directly worked with the student, apart from general chats and advice on professional stuff at work. \n\nThe whole situation made me uncomfortable, especially the talking off the record part. I know that academia now is acknowledging how informal networks of privilege work, and it felt a bit like that was what is happening, given that student B is young (although very accomplished). If an application has a process for formal referees then they should be talking to the referees, right, and not to random colleagues? And especially not by actively disclosing application information to someone that the applicant might work with, without their consent. It felt off to me, but at the same time, I didn't want to do anything to harm this young person's career, either. \n\nI ended up writing to A saying that while I only had positive things to say about B, I had not worked directly with them, nor had I supervised them, and so they would be better served by speaking with the head of the institute, who she had worked with directly for an extended period of time, and who, I understood, was in fact a referee. I noted that B had sought advice from me on application writing, so it might not be appropriate for me to comment either, in the circumstances. I offered to put them in touch with the head of the institute, if they wanted a personal introduction. Later I also had a word with the head of my institute, to give them a heads-up, who agreed it was a weird email, but  confirmed that B would be getting a glowing reference from them for this and all other applications. \n\nAfter all this ,I got an extremely rude and huffy email from A, saying that \"most people wouldn't have a problem\" speaking with them even in these circumstances, and essentially telling me off for refusing to have an off the record phone call with them about the student. Is this true, that \"most people\" would do it? I doubt that, but I wanted to know what you guys think.",

The post was removed (a short version is in my post history on r/college).

I forwarded the email to the department chair with a note that I wanted to document the informal complaint process and asking for any advice regarding seeking a resolution or escalating to a formal complaint. \n\nThe dept. chair was very kind, said she took my concerns seriously, and that she would speak to the professor, and scheduled a Zoom meeting with me for tomorrow.  \n\nThis evening, my professor graded ALL of my ungraded assignments, most with feedback.

From this timing, I'm pretty sure that she graded only MY assignments and no other students' submissions. \n\nI'm going to chat with the dept. chair tomorrow about my concerns, and appreciate all the suggestions to focus on the stuff that actually matters as opposed to more trivial complaints (such as she offers extra credit if you tell her via email that you posted a RateMyProfessor review). \n\nThanks all, and feel free to delete if this isn't allowed.",

Although I am second author on the paper, I am the one who did the bulk of the writing and handled the submission (reason for this is not the purpose of the post, please don't ask). \n\nThe reason the paper keeps getting rejected is that (in our opinion) our experimental results seem to be in opposition to preconceived ideas in the field and this (in our opinion) biases the reviewers. For example, many of the comments we have received are akin to\n\n&gt;simulations reported in \\[X\\] of a similar experiment showed no effect! These results cannot be true! \n\ndespite our work having simulations of our experiment (not just similar) and show a clear effect. The reasons for the rejection and venting about them is not the purpose of this post, I just bring them up to emphasize that I do not think the quality of the work is the issue. Reviewers note the manuscript is well-written. \n\nI began a post-doc about six months ago and my work is going very well. I am working in a new area, my work is generating excitement in the community, and I already have two papers we believe to be important in review. \n\nAlthough it was important for me to publish my PhD work during my PhD, I no longer feel the motivation to dedicate the time to editing the paper again, submitting the paper again, etc... The revisions requested are major: more simulations, more figures (despite word/page limits and not being able to submit supplementary material), etc...  and this will fall on me, just like the writing of the paper did. I just wish to move on, especially since my current work, for which I am the driving force and first author, is going so well. \n\nMy old PI, however, wants to publish this work and, of course, that is an understandable perspective. \n\nHave any of you been in a similar situation?",

I have to hand in a research proposal for my master thesis starting in february (20.000 words). The problem is that whenever doing research I constantly seem to struggle with deciding the scope of my study because I tend to want to describe broad trends as opposed to in depth niche issues, as well as deciding upon a proper methodology\n\nI prefer a specific way of working: I like to analyze broad trends, both contemporary and historical. Quite often I will come to the conclusion that the existing secondary literature has failed to properly describe this trend.\n\nI then usually work in a way in which I start from describing the history of the trend as a way of historical context and work my way up to the present day, almost creating a narrative in a way. Throughout this I will compare secondary literature, use primary sources etc. to show that I think the existing literature is incomplete in describing said trend/ideas.\n\nWhile this methodology has always worked fine for doing my essays, when it comes to writing my thesis my supervisors keep hammering on the fact that I need to specify, that describing an entire trend and its history is too broad, that I need to come up with a proper methodology and that I need to find a gap in the existing literature.\n\nWeirdly, many if not most research articles/book chapters that I read during my study seem to have roughly been written in the same way as I prefer to write\n\nhttps://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/51255/9789004435544.pdf?sequence=1#page=325\n\nAn example would be the article above by Joas Wagemakers in which he describes Salafism, describes what the trend is according to him and how many have a wrong view of what it actually is. He does so by contextualizing it through history and looking at both secondary and primary literature. \n\nThe article is only 5000 words but if I were to tackle a similar issue my supervisors would definitely see it as being too broad and lacking a proper methodology.\n\nCan anyone help me gain some understanding on why my way of working is wrong (the feedback of my supervisors really isn’t that helpful) and what some proper methodological approaches are that could fit these type of research questions that I’m interested in?",

I'm currently working alongside a Master's EEG project which gives me some hands-on research experience but is not directly transferrable to the research field I want to go into. Besides that I am also shadowing lab meetings in a systems neuroscience lab in my uni and am familiar with programming techniques relevant to my field.\n\nI would like to get to know some of your guys' experience/advice for applying to placements in London unis. I'm from King's College London but would like to perhaps expand to UCL or Imperial research centres. Also, I was wondering whether anyone has had success with personally reaching out to project leaders in large research institutes, especially the Francis Crick Institute, to get involved in their lab. I was offered an interview for the Crick's placement year scheme but I just received a rejection letter today :/...\n\nWhat is the pay (if there is even any) like for research placements in university labs? Although the pay is not my biggest concern, I think it will look better on CVs/future applications if recruitment sees that my work is of value. Also, has as anyone had any luck with continuing in the lab after their placement year was over as my big undergraduate goal is to try to get my name on a publication.\n\nThanks!",

More specifically, he has quizzed and tested us on material that was never taught in lecture, is not in our class notes, is not in our textbook, and is not on the syllabus as topics we should know.  \n\nAfter awhile of going back-and-forth with him about this, I decided to take word-for-word notes of our lectures so I had proof that we were not taught some topics.  Yes I know it’s petty, but my Professor doesn’t record lecture and I live in a 2-party consent state so I can’t record him.  I have already anonymously reported this Professor to the department for this (alongside other reasons) but I don’t know if anything came out of it.\n\nWe just took a final worth 30% of our grade, and two of the questions were not in any of the aformented places.  When I told him this, he said I was wrong and he did mention it, but he couldn’t remember when.  He previously told me I “must not have been at lecture that day” when I asked him about other quizzed/tested material, so I did show him my “notes” aka my word-for-word transcription. \n\nAfter this I made sure to archive his entire website so I have proof of the material not being there.  He has previously added material that wasn’t taught to the class &amp; was tested to his website (without giving back credit ofc) before this, so I want to make sure I cover my bases here.\n\nShould I report him?

I moved to a new state and spent the past year in another neuro lab gaining ephys experience. I just applied for neuro phd programs for admission next fall. \n\nNeuroscience is all I've known and loved, but my current project is incredibly ambitious and difficult to perform. Although I have worked very hard and made progress in the quality of my work, I have not made much progress. My PI expectations, being broke, having no friends and family here, and all the other common grievances you've all heard about academia, have made me feel completely burnt out even though I was excited for my Phd just a few months ago. \n\nI do not feel like I can meet the challenges and expectations of grad school anymore. I feel that  my lab skills are not useful in industry (onky relevent skills are cell culture and scRNA seq library prep). Furthermore, I doubt my PIs will support me (references) since I will essentially be abandoning all I have worked for.\n\nIf anyone has any advice I'd greatly appreciate it. Thanks!\n\nTLDR: What steps do I have to take to leave neuroscience academia by next september? I cannot use my PIs for references and I have few transferable skills.",
