I am about to finish Morning star and then I will undoubtedly have to continue the series until &gt;!I can't stand the back stabbings and betrayals anymore!&lt; lol.\n\nThe author has a lot going on in their mind to come up with all the plot twist and turns.  it is much more complicated than some recent fantasy book I have been reading,\n\nthis has been a nice welcome back to Sci Fi.",

Even such settings as Star Wars and Warhammer 40k fall apart when you consider that a few million systems those civilizations occupy is still only about 1% of 1% of Milky Way(Presently believed to contain between 400 and 600 billion stars).\n\nPersonally, i got a tiny bit of the sense of scale hen i played Spore, it's galaxy is only 100 000 systems which is 10% of the 1% of the 1% of the real galaxy, but good luck colonizing even that within your lifetime.\n\nI don't understand why people who make Sci-Fi can't portray their settingon the scale it really exists on. Like the old Freelancer game, which all takes place in a small cluster of 40 or so stars wrapped within a nebula. This makes the entire game feel so much larger than it really is, ironically.",

The excitable lad was inflating and deflating nearly fifty percent with each breath and his fur was positively fluffed. The idle thought that the humans of the base would find it quite ‘cute’ crossed the commander’s mind as he continued tapping at his report. Forty-fifth Trills finally managed to bring his breathing under control and began hopping around the desk surface in agitation.\n\n“You know that they warned us to not let the humans get bored?” Forty-fifth Trills demanded in the mother tongue.\n\nThe commander would have scolded him for using a language that most of the other species of the base couldn’t hear, let alone understand, but he gathered that could wait until the end of the report. Forty-fifth Trills was now quickly summarizing the various reports they had been given of how odd humans were. He seemed to be circling over the concept of boredom.  He finally wound up with a summary of human viral tolerances and crouched there gasping at the commander. The wing commander let a long half second drag out before glancing at the youth.\n\n“And what exactly,” the wing commander asked, “does this general madness have to do with you bursting into my office at the present moment?”\n\nForty-fifth Trills stared at him blankly for a moment before rapidly brushing his wing-hooks over his horns.\n\n“There is a possibility that one of the humans has a virus!” Forty-fifth Trills burst out.\n\nThe wing commander instantly fluffed with concern.\n\n“Has the human self isolated?” he demanded.\n\n“No!” Forty-fifth Trills stated. “The human insisted he was fine.”\n\n“What makes you conclude he had a virus?” the wing commander asked as he hurriedly began to put his desk in order.\n\nThe only thing more wing-stiff than a healthy human was an ill human but usually a direct order from a ranking officer was enough to send them to rest.\n\n“He vomited!” Forty-fifth Trills informed with with horrified resonances in his voice but fascinated ripples in his neck fur.\n\nThe wing commander immediately took to flight at that. Forty-fifth Trills took off after him.\n\n“The humans are in the lower docking bay,” Forty-fifth Trills told him.\n\n“What are they doing there?” the wing commander demanded. “Didn’t they notice that one of their own was evacuating his digestive tract?”\n\n“I am reasonably sure that is what the rest were laughing at,” Forty-fifth Trills explained.\n\nThe wing commander hovered and rotated slowly to stare at him.\n\n“The humans were not expressing concern over their comrade?” he asked carefully.\n\nForty-fifth Trill chirped a confused affirmative.\n\n“Humans usually take far more care of their flight-mates than of each other…” he said musingly.\n\n“Yes,” Forty-fifth Trills agreed as they set off down the corridor at a more sedate pace.\n\nThey reached the docking bay in question and were greeted by an encouraging chant. The humans were circled around an open space. There were two circles marked out on the floor in tape. In roughly the center of the circles was a human holding a broom, and spinning. Their head was bent over to touch the tip of the broom handles to their forehead and their feat danced around the broom and they spun their center of mass around and around.\n\nForty-fifth Trills noted one particular human who was a distinctly different shade of health than the rest and pointed him out with a chirp. They flew over to the human. One Junior Ranger Bryzinke, and chirped for permission to land on his shoulders. He grinned at them and held out his arm. The landed and crept close to his ear to be heard over the chanting.\n\n“Are you well Bryzinke?” the wing commander asked.\n\n“Pretty good,” Bryzinke said with a shrug. “I cleaned up the mess I made and drank some water. Fortunately most of them have stronger stomachs than I do.”\n\n“What exactly happened,” the wing commander asked.\n\nThe human gave a massive snort of laughter.\n\n“What usually happens when a human spins to fast,” he said. “The inner ear objects to the brain and the brain orders the stomach to punish the body until the spinning stops.”\n\nThe chanting suddenly reached a crescendo and the two spinning humans dropped the brooms and staggered towards a pair of towels, each holding the clutter of a disassembled personal projectile weapon.  They fell to their knees and began groping at the parts.\n\n“What are they doing?” the wing commander asked.\n\n“It’s a timed competition,” Bryzinke explained. “I was disqualified for chucking but Reeds there had a real chance to win this. She says she was the base champion back in her cadet days.”\n\nReed suddenly doubled over and clutched her head with a groan.\n\n“Course those were more than a few years ago,” Bryzinke said with a sympathetic wince.\n\n“I would like you to report to the medical bay so I can scan the results of this game,” the wing commander finally said.\n\n“Sure thing,” Bryzinke said with a nod. “Soon as we’re done here.”\n\n# [Humans are Weird](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B09NN2PM8D?binding=paperback&amp;ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk) [​Book Series](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B09NN2PM8D?binding=paperback&amp;ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk)\n\n# [Amazon (Kindle, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NN2PM8D?binding=paperback&amp;ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk)\n\n# [Barnes &amp; Nobel (Nook, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/%22Humans+are+Weird%22?Ntk=P_Series_Title&amp;Ns=P_Series_Number&amp;Ntx=mode+matchall)\n\n# [Kobo by Rakuten (ebook and Audiobook)](https://www.kobo.com/us/en/search?query=Humans%20are%20Weird&amp;fcsearchfield=Series&amp;seriesId=a035ce04-e582-5fcc-b327-16c68ca4b418&amp;fcshowpointsprice=no&amp;fcmaxprice=5&amp;fcminprice=0&amp;id=1561e6f7-742f-4c1b-a804-187728814574)\n\n# [Google Play Books (ebook and Audiobook)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Humans_are_Weird_I_Have_the_Data?id=7_wdEAAAQBAJ&amp;gl=US)\n\n# Please Leave Reviews on the Newest Book!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/2ggu6b99y1ja1.gif",

I was having a discussion with one of my partners about the trope of “colony drop” as it’s listed on Tvtropes, which admittedly doesn’t necessarily require a Colony. \n\nAs such, I’m wondering what the earliest piece of fiction that utilizes an actual Colony drop as a weapon. The villainous “two birds with one stone” of crashing a living space with a large population, into a planet, to kill the populations of both. \n\nThis could be a large spaceship meant not just as a means of travel, but also as a place that sustains a large population, an asteroid with a colony built into it; an artificial space station sustaining a city-sized population, etc. \n\nLaunching the land upon one city sits, to another region, to kill the population of both. \n\nThe earliest I can think of that I personally am familiar with, is indeed, Char Aznabel, Gundam (1979).\n\nBut I suspect in written science fiction something like this MUST predate this. \n\nY’all have any thoughts?",

There are some who are uncritical enthusiasts — who like everything. There are some who are extremely difficult to satisfy, who are intensely critical on an intellectual plane. And there are some who are interested only in the science fiction ideas of a story and give not a solitary rap about the quality of the writing, the dialogue, good or bad, the characterization or the general effectiveness and convincingness of a story. If said story has a gimmick which captures their imaginations, it can be the worst story in the world, they are for it. Not too many readers balance all these factors and add a genuine appreciation of the author’s ability as a writer.*\n\nI discussed the quote in a short post on my substack this week: [https://evangelosscifi.substack.com/p/occasional-miscellany](https://evangelosscifi.substack.com/p/occasional-miscellany)",

The story he sent me at F&amp;SF was an amazing sf idea that hid a terrifying rape fantasy. \n\nHis attitude toward women was appalling. I passed on the story, and he wrote me a 4-page single spaced beautifully written threat, telling me when he next saw me, he’d rape me. I let the other editors know. No one bought the rape fantasy, but one editor bought this guy’s first story. It was nominated for a Nebula and a Hugo. \n\nAt the Nebula ceremony (which I attended) said writer lost, got drunk, and attacked the woman who ran the SFWA suite. Her friends protected her. He was not banned from Worldcon or the Hugos after that, so I spent most of that Worldcon avoiding this guy. \n\nTurns out he had been in jail for rape, and had only recently been released. \n\nAnd he was a fantastic writer. He should have been barred from the magazines. He was not. Since this was the 1990s, \n\nI’m haunted by the fear that he attacked some poor woman while he was at Worldcon, and we never heard about it.",
