One day I didn‚Äôt hear from him‚Ä¶ and the next.. and the next‚Ä¶ we were pretty serious and had been talking for like a year solid. Then I got a text. He passed away in his sleep suddenly and his brother found him. His brother knew about me and got his phone and told me the news and I remember feeling like the world was crashing down. I kept in touch with his brother until I met my now husband. I ended up moving to a different part of Florida and I still occasionally think about this boy. Today is hitting me harder because I think of the life I have now‚Ä¶ that boy was amazing and truly my first love. I feel like shit for thinking that and saying that now that I‚Äôm married with kids. Is this completely wrong to think? Am I a terrible person?",

        "text": "Hello all. This will be long because it's a long story. So I 19M and my gf 18f recently broke up. I've been told I'm a dumb teen and that things will get better but I don't know what to do. So we started dating a little over a year ago. We met at work, shared a lot of hobbies, and instantly clicked. She was my first girlfriend. Things were great until about six months into our relationship. I had a mental break down, and honestly fell into a depression. Just took a huge toll on our relationship as well as seeing each other every day whether it was at work or hanging out. We were crazy in love with each other. We had talked about moving in together, and even our future together. We talked about getting married and having kids. I truly believe that she was my soulmate. that I was supposed to be with her forever. But while I was going through my struggles, it started taking a toll on her mental health. I got so bad to the point where I was hurting myself. One day we got into a fight, and we broke up. After only one day of being broken up, we got back together. Then a week later we broke up again. And we tried being friends with benefits. Then things took a turn for the worse. And we didn't talk for a week. Now we're talking again and I asked her if we could try things again. I've been going to therapy and I have improve my mental state. I have also determine the ways that I can keep myself from falling into a depression again. and when I asked her if we could try things again, she said she didn't think so. I really don't know what to do because all I want is to prove to her that I can be better. Just to prove to her that I love her more than anything, and I still see our future together.  But she's scared that if we get back together, things are just gonna go back to hell they were before. Me being depressed and hurting myself. We were also both very jealous, but a lot of that came from me being insecure. So she scared if we try again things we're gonna go back to the way they were. But I truly believe that if we try it again, things will be better. For multiple reasons. What should I do? I love her with all of my heart and still see a future with her but I'm not sure if she sees her future anymore. I think she still has feelings for me I think she's just scared of going back to how things were. and I don't know if I should just let it go, or give her time to heal, or if I should keep trying to be with her. All I know is that I love her more than anything, and if I'm ever going to move on from these feelings, I can't talk to her anymore. But a world without her in my life just doesn't seem enjoyable. She was really and truly the best part of my life and made me so happy. I don't want to be with anyone else but her. I don't know what to do.",

But a week ago I had an extremely difficult day, the details don‚Äôt really matter, but it ended up leading to a relapse. Unfortunately.. I severely underestimated how sharp the instrument I used was, leading to me lacerating deep through the muscle of my upper thigh in one swipe. I was rushed to and treated at a nearby ER, and I‚Äôm currently recovering. But today I received the news that I will most likely never fully recover from the damage to the muscle and nerves in my thigh. I‚Äôll never walk normally again. I keep getting told how lucky I am that I didn‚Äôt lose my leg, and I understand that, but none of the doctors seem to realize how devastating the lack of mobility I have and the amount of pain I‚Äôm in really is. Only my boyfriend and doctors know what really happened. I told everyone else it was from a dog bite. But nobody knows how heartbroken I am over what I‚Äôve done. I never meant for this to happen. I‚Äôve ruined myself for the rest of my life.",

        "text": "As√≠ que tal como dice el t√≠tulo, necesito consejos.\nEs mi primera vez posteando aqu√≠, por favor, sean buenos. \nMi novio (m 35) y yo (f 34) tenemos una relaci√≥n de hace 10 a√±os. No es una relaci√≥n perfecta, ya hemos superado una separaci√≥n,  volv√≠ con √©l durante el confinamiento en la pandemia cuando tuvimos que compartir casa ya que ninguno ten√≠a a donde ir, empez√≥ con la reconquista y nos reconciliamos. Nos hab√≠amos separado porque se fue a vivir a la ciudad capital, luego me enter√© que estaba saliendo con una ex de hace mucho. \nA pesar de todo eso decidimos continuar juntos y superar todo.\nEl d√≠a de hoy muy temprano me escribi√≥ desde instagram acus√°ndome de que lo estaba enga√±ando, yo estaba muy desconcertada le pregunt√© que pasaba, lo √∫nico que obtuve fueron insultos y malos tratos, me dec√≠a que soy una zorra y que s√© hacer muy bien las cosas. Yo no entend√≠a nada. Llam√© a su hermana para preguntarle si hab√≠an bebido la noche anterior, cre√≠ que estaba borracho o drogado. Debo resaltar que √©l ahora se encuentra en casa de su hermana, en otro pa√≠s, viaj√≥ hace una semana ya que no ve a sus sobrinos hace m√°s de 5 a√±os. La hermana me dijo que no hab√≠an celebrado nada, que incluso se hab√≠an ido a dormir temprano. Yo estaba m√°s que confundida, le dije que me encontraba activa en instagram porque lo estaba etiquetando en varios videos graciosos. Me dijo que era una mentirosa ya que no le hab√≠a llegado ninguna etiqueta, tuve que grabar mi pantalla ense√±√°ndole en que lo etiqueta, pero creo que su insta no estaba actualizado ya que me envi√≥ una captura donde en efecto, no hab√≠a ninguna notificaci√≥n m√≠a. Trate de calmarme ya que para ese momento estaba en un mar de l√°grimas,  le pregunt√© que le pasaba y me dijo que hab√≠a so√±ado que yo lo enga√±aba y s√≠ lo hab√≠a so√±ado eran por algo. Me amenaz√≥ con no volver si se enteraba de algo. En ese momento no sab√≠a que sentir o pensar, me estaba acusando de algo grav√≠simo ¬øporqu√© lo so√±√≥? La cabeza me daba vueltas,  quer√≠a vomitar de la ira, le dije que si quer√≠a terminar conmigo esa excusa era est√∫pida,  me volvi√≥ a acusar de que si quer√≠a terminar con el es porque soy una zorra y ya quiero andar revolc√°ndome con otros hombres, hasta ese momento yo segu√≠a llorando, le envi√© otro video donde abro todas mis aplicaciones de mensajer√≠a, pr√°cticamente le mostr√© con qui√©n hablaba y en qu√© horarios, sigui√≥ acusandome sin entender razones. Mi dolor y decepci√≥n se volvieron fuiria y odio, sent√≠ que algo se da√±√≥ dentro de m√≠ otra vez, le dije que cuando se calme y vuelva a ser una persona coherente ojal√° yo quiera hablar con √©l,  porque esta ofensa nunca se la iba a perdonar, dej√© de responderle y lo √∫ltimo que me dijo fue que ya estaba \"solterita\" a modo de burla, y que ten√≠a la ciudad entera para m√≠. No respond√≠ a eso. Ahora no se que hacer, no s√© que responderle si es que me llegara a escribir, me  pareci√≥ tan de locos toda la situaci√≥n. Acusarme sin pruebas s√≥lo por un sue√±o. La verdad no se que pensar.",
