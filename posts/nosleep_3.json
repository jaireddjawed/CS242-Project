        "text": "We were high school sweethearts. All flustered and infatuated with eachother. Normal for a couple who were in their very first relationship. However, this incident has made be rethink everything that has happened, before my girlfriend died. \n\nDaisy was her name. Fitting for someone like her. Full of innocence and joy. \n\nShe spoke with elegance and kindness. She had strawberry blonde hair, going up to her shoulders, and it was a little wavy at the ends of it. I used to tease her over it. \n\nDaisy had a large family. 1 sibling and a horde of extended family relatives. I was very close with her family, actually. She had a sister, named Marigold, who usually accompanied us on the many dates we would have. \n\nUnlike Daisy, however, Marigold was the complete opposite of her. Marigold was rude and snooty, and usually was very moody. Marigold was bipolar. Changed moods like every hour. It was annoying, up until a certain point. Then I realized something. Something critical, and important. \n\nYou see, a few days before Daisy's death, Marigold went into an episode. She ended up harming her sister during it. My beloved girlfriend was hurt. Her family were being defensive towards Marigold, saying that she couldn't control it, and that it wasn't her fault. But I was beyond angry. I felt numb inside, as I had constant anxiety over whether she would survive or not. \n\nI lived in an area known for its bustling nightlife and clubs. So it was normal to me to casually see a few drunks around causing trouble to anyone and everyone they can spot. I was in a park, and it was around 11PM when I started to see something unusual. It was just in the corner of my eye, but obscured by the many trees and wildlife around it. Then, I saw it. \n\nIt was a humanoid figure. The figure appearance was horrifying. It had no skin or fat, just muscles. The muscles were protruding and were constantly relaxing and tensing up, with a squelching sound every second. \n\nThe figure started to walk towards me. I froze in place, as my thoughts started to race and confirm whether it was real, or of I was just hallucinating it. I started to dart my eyes towards the other people in the park, who were simply unfazed by this monster. \n\n\"I have a deal for you.\" It started to speak, its mouth squelching and squeezing at every syllable it could say. I was speechless. I could only watch its body tower over me, standing there intimidatingly. \n\n\"What are you?\" I said, fear filling my body. \n\n\"My deal is simple. I'll grant you anything you want, but for-\" \n\nI cut him off. \"I decline your offer.\" \n\nThe figure stared at me with its bloodshot eyes, staring me down with pure anger. Adrenaline fuels me as I started to run away, never looking back. \n\nDaisy died the day after this specific incident. I was with her as she breathed her last breath. Overcome with grief, I left her bedside, and decided to take a stroll in the same park, reliving our precious memories together and wondering what I had done to deserve this. I was just pondering over my thoughts, when I saw a familiar face. \n\nThe figure was sitting down, cross legged. As it spotted me, it said something I could never forget.  \n\n\"Don't disobey me again.\"",

        "text": "I (34F) have always been a bit skeptical when it comes to spirits and the paranormal. But lately, something strange has been happening in my house, and I can't explain it.\n\nIt all started a few weeks ago, when I inherited an old mirror from my grandmother. At first, I was excited to have a piece of family history in my home, but soon after I brought the mirror home, I began to notice strange things happening.\n\nIt started with little things, like seeing movement out of the corner of my eye when I was alone in the room with the mirror. But then, the movement became more distinct. I started seeing shadows that seemed to dart across the surface of the glass.\n\nOne night, when I was home alone, I saw something that I couldn't explain. As I was walking past the mirror, I caught a glimpse of a figure standing behind me in the reflection. I spun around, heart pounding, but there was no one there. When I turned back to the mirror, the figure was gone.\n\nOver the next few days, the figure appeared more frequently. She was always standing behind me, just out of focus, as if waiting for something. I started to feel like I was being watched all the time, like there was something in my house that I couldn't see.\n\nI didn't know what to do. I tried to talk to my husband about it, but he didn't believe me. He thought I was just stressed out from work and needed to relax.\n\nBut my kids, (my little girl is six and my son is eight), believed me. They started to get scared to be in the same room as the mirror and would often ask me to cover it up or even move it to another room.\n\nOne night, when my husband was out of town, I couldn't take it anymore. I got up the courage to confront the figure in the mirror. As I approached the mirror, I could see her more clearly. She was a woman, with long dark hair and sad eyes. She looked like she was from another time.\n\nI stood in front of the mirror, staring into her eyes. I asked her who she was and what she wanted. But she just stood there, silent and unmoving.\n\nAs I watched her, something strange happened. The glass of the mirror began to warp and twist, as if it was melting. The woman's figure started to become distorted, and then, in a flash of light, she disappeared.\n\nAfter that, things went back to normal. I didn't see the movements and the woman in the mirror again, and the strange movements and shadows stopped. It’s been around a month, I haven’t got any sleep since then and I haven’t told anyone yet, I don’t want to be seen as crazy or schizophrenic.\n\nBut I can't shake the feeling that something isn't right. My kids still get scared around the mirror, and I worry that they might see something that I don’t.\n\nIf anyone has any advice, please tell me. I’ve looked around online but it seems like I can’t do anything about it, and I’m scared that getting rid of the mirror will make it worse. I can’t move somewhere else either because of financial reasons since I’m currently unemployed.\n\nIf anything else happens, I'll be sure to update this post.",

        "text": "Let me start this off by saying: do not fuck with a woman and her vacation. Trust me, it will help you out a lot in the long run.\n\nThis whole thing started the night I took my girlfriend out on a nice dinner date. We were all dressed up and went to a fancy and pretty expensive restaurant located in the middle of the city.\n\nMy girlfriend, Karla, enjoys the finer things in life. She comes from a poorer background than most, so I can totally see why she likes the things she does. She likes higher end food (who doesn’t), fashion, cars, you get the point. I try to help fund her little adventures when I can, and love to see her smile when she’s having fun. Growing up she had to do whatever it took to survive, if not she’d probably be dead by now, so I have to admire her for that. Her strength is one of the many attributes about her that made me fall head-over-heels in the first place. \n\nI make good money at the company I work for so it was easy to spoil her every once in a while. Karla does well for herself too. She runs a small business that is pretty successful and growing by the day. Bottom line, we’re well off. Besides, The pure unbridled joy on her face is priceless compared to a new designer dress or handbag. \n\nKarla had just downed her second glass of the four-hundred dollar bottle of wine we ordered when she brought the topic up.\n\n “Hey babe? When was the last time we went on a trip?”\n\n“About six months ago, why?” I asked, recalling the fond memories of our time together.\n\n“I think we both deserve a break don’t you? We’ve been working hard and should go on a vacation!”\n\nI nodded in agreement as I took a bite out of my juicy porterhouse. “Where are you thinking of going?”\n\n“I’m so glad you asked!” She squealed in delight. She then reached across the table to wrap my hands in hers. “I’ve been thinking we could go on a tropical cruise to the Bahamas!”\n\n“That sounds doable. When were you thinking of going?” I asked, taking a sip of wine. It definitely didn’t taste like four-hundred bucks worth, but Karla ordered before I could say anything. We had agreed that I’d cover the dinner so I was calculating how bad my pockets would be suffering after the date in the back of my head.\n\nAll the talk of vacation sprang on a sudden migraine, but that could’ve been due to the ridiculous sweetness of the wine Karla ordered. I was also under a lot of stress at the time, both financially and mentally. \n\n“Oh I wasn’t done, sweet cheeks.” She interrupted. \n\n“My bad, continue.” I said as I poured her another glass of red wine. \n\n“After the cruise I was thinking we could visit Japan! I hear the cherry blossoms are beautiful this time of year, and on the way home we could stop in Hawaii for a while to swim, drink, and explore!”\n\nShe looked so excited as she talked, but I had to be the reasonable one in this situation.\n\n“That’s quite the vacation you’ve dreamt up there, darling. How long would this trip even last? Between the cruise, the flights, and hotel stays, it would probably be a few weeks. I don’t know if I’d be able to take that much time off. You either. Not to mention how much a translator/guide would cost since neither of us speak Japanese or have ever been to Japan before.”\n\nHer smile turned into a frown. \n\n“Plus, it’s going to be pretty expensive between the two of us.” I added on.\n\nA defeated look filled her features.\n\n“Listen, I’m sure if we save up for a while we’d be able to afford to go on the trip. We’d probably have to save up for a year at most.”\n\nShe looked down at her plate shyly before she spoke,” Well actually… I was hoping we could leave by the end of next week or the week after that at the latest.”\n\nI had to take a beat to process her request. There was no way in hell I’d be able to get that much time off approved from work on such short notice. And to be quite honest, Karla’s lavish lifestyle was becoming difficult to maintain. Sure I loved to see her happy and all, but she was spending more than what she was making, so there was little of her money left for important things like rent and utilities that I had to continually make up the difference for. It didn’t help that she chose the large open concept apartment we live in. It’s beautiful, don’t get me wrong, but it’s in the richer part of the city so rent is outrageous and we barely use fifty percent of the space anyway. \n\nBesides, our last trip to Myrtle beach was enough for me. We ate good food, had fun at the beach and in the hotel room, what more did we need? International travel seemed fun and all, but if you think about it, it’s super taxing and just a lot. She was basically asking me to plan a two to four week multi-thousand dollar vacation in the span of like a week. Talk about unrealistic expectations!\n\n“Listen love bug,” I started nicely, trying to soften the blow. Knowing Karla, she was going to throw a fit when I essentially told her no. “I know you’re excited about this whole trip that you’ve got planned out in your head, but we’ve gotta be realistic here.”\n\n“Cecil.” She said, testingly. She gave me her signature bombastic side eye, daring me. Her whole expression read “I will scream right here and now if I don’t get my way.”\n\nI sighed. “Karla, I’ll be shitting bricks when you get to go on this vacation.”\n\nA hurt expression filled her beautiful features, but if I needed her to truly understand the gravity of something, I had to be blunt and harsh. \n\nShe downed the rest of her glass of wine before turning her head away to avoid looking at me. She rested her chin over her hands before she muttered something along the lines of,” Fine, have it your way.”\n\nThe rest of that dinner we ate in silence and she stewed. An ominous feeling overcame me and something in my gut told me that I’d come to regret this. Come to regret it I did.\n\nAbout a week after the date night dinner disaster, around the time Karla originally wanted to go on her dream vacation, she made me a bowl of maple and brown sugar oatmeal for breakfast. One thing that should be known is that since Karla owns an e-commerce business, some mainly works from home. So, if she has time in the mornings, she’ll make us breakfast while I get ready for work. If I’m extra lucky, she’ll even pack my lunch.\n\nI was running a bit behind that day, so she settled on something quick and easy to make for me, an unsuspecting bowl of oatmeal.\n\n“Here hun! Better eat it quickly, don’t want to be late or to let it get cold.” She said with a smile as she placed the bowl with the golden oats on our table for me. It seemed Karla had long since let go of her vacation whims by that point.\n\nI quickly sat down and grabbed a couple spoonfuls of the stuff. Karla hovered behind me the whole time. Eagerly watching me like an animal stalking its prey.\n\nThe usually sweet oatmeal tasted extremely bitter, and even a bit burnt. After the first bite, my lips started to tingle a little. At least the tingling took my taste away.\n\n“Go on sweetie, take a couple more bites.” She urged as she gingerly lay her hands on my shoulders, starting to rub them a little.\n\n“Mm! So delicious!” I lied. I mixed the oatmeal around to see if she had somehow burnt the oatmeal, but all I found were the usual small bits of brown sugar that hadn’t melted down yet.\n\nAfter the fifth or sixth bite, I had to cough. My lips, mouth, and throat were still tingling. The feeling was getting more intense as time went on.\n\nBefore I could question her or do anything else, Karla ushered me out of the apartment. She gave me a water bottle which I graciously accepted. After chugging it my mouth felt a little better. Dazed, I rushed to work.\n\nTen minutes after arriving at work, my still tingling mouth started to fill with drool as I started to uncontrollably salivate. The intense urge to vomit came with it. I felt ill. My stomach was upset, I was ghostly pale, and sweating buckets. It looked like I was an unsuspecting victim of the ice bucket challenge because of how much I had sweat through my work shirt.\n\nOne of my superiors took notice of my ghastly appearance during that morning's debrief meeting and asked if I was feeling alright. I didn’t get the chance to respond because I excused myself as I almost threw up all over him.\n\nThe second I was in front of a toilet in the men’s bathroom, everything in my stomach was unleashed into the toilet bowl with the same fury as a hurricane. I almost hurled again as chunks of gray oatmeal and acidic stomach juices swirled around the bowl when I flushed.\n\nNot a moment after I left the stall to clean myself up did the most intense, gut wrenching, pain fill my entire abdominal region. It felt like I had been stabbed with a sword and it was being thrust twisted inside of my guts. The most foul smelling cloud of gas left my tuchus, which thrusted me into another wave of pain as my knees went weak and buckled. Clutching my stomach, I slowly unbuckled my belt, pulled my pants down, and parked my ass on the toilet seat.\n\nIt felt like an eternity had passed of me trying to push out that god forsaken dookie. A grown man could’ve taken three showers with all the sweat that left every orifice of my body. My ass at one point was so wet, I had to push my hands against the stall to keep myself from slipping off my porcelain prison. I truly thought I was going to die in that stall. \n\nI don’t know what giving birth feels like, but I think pushing that demon spawn out of my butthole was pretty close to the feeling. There was a tiny splash of water and a small stream of wet ickiness that came after.\n\nI slowly gathered some toilet paper and gingerly wiped the ring of fire that was my rectum. The toilet paper was drenched in blood when I finished. I took a quick peek into the depths below and found a hard as rock gray pebble floating in the pinkish water.\n\nThat was the last straw for my body. A combination of exhaustion, blood loss, and dehydration caused me to slip in and out of consciousness. One second I was on the toilet, the next there’s blood dripping down between my legs as I lay pants-less on the bathroom stall, surrounded by worried co-workers, then nothing but a cool abyss.\n\nI woke up in a sterile hospital room. My head was woozy and my stomach felt a shit ton better and lighter. It also felt stiff, tight, and burned a little.\n\nKarla was sitting besides me holding my hand, stroking her thumb along the back of my hand. She noticed I woke up and gave me a smile.\n\n“Oh, Pookie! I’m so glad you’re awake!” She then pressed the call button on the remote to my bed.\n\nA doctor then came into the room. Turns out I had been in and out of it for a week, though I don’t remember anything. \n\nMy coworkers had called an ambulance and I was quickly rushed to hospital. After testing, they found I had some pretty severe burns to my mouth, tongue, and esophagus, along with a bowel obstruction. They rushed me into emergency surgery where about a foot and a half of my intestine was removed in what’s called a bowel resection.\n\nWhen the contents of my removed bowel came back, it was revealed that the blockage was quite literally a concrete casting of my intestine. The doctors think I must’ve ingested something containing a hefty, borderline lethal, amount of quick drying cement powder. \n\nAfter my doctor explained that to me, he went into detail about some serious damage that was done to my stomach. The best option, in his opinion, was a partial gastrectomy. Which is when a portion of your stomach is removed. Typically this kind of operation is performed on patients with stomach cancer or tumors. \n\nThey questioned me about what I ate that day, trying to determine how the cement ended up in my system, but I was still too weak and out of it to really answer them at the time. They asked me questions like,” Have you ever eaten and craved something people shouldn’t be eating?”\n\nI just shrugged my shoulders and the doctor told me about a condition called pica, which makes you crave weird things like dirt. He said I probably didn’t have it since I didn’t have a history of eating quick dry cement, but told me we’d do further testing.\n\nKarla talked the ears off of the whole nursing staff about how unexpected all this was and how inconvenient it was for her. She even came up with a few theories of how it ended up in my system. One of them was about a McDonald’s breakfast burrito that came from a recently renovated McDonald’s. That one was rich. She told them she was going to sue them for millions. Surprisingly nothing about oatmeal was brought up, though. \n\nFinally when all the doctors and nurses were gone, and I had finished the only good tasting thing my liquid diet would allow, tomato soup, Karla snuggled up in the hospital bed with me. She stroked my matted hair and ran her fingers up and down my arm before quietly whispering in my ear,” You’ve shit your bricks, now where’s my vacation?”\n\nThat was a week ago. I’m getting discharged from the hospital soon. Karla and I have been looking at hotel bookings in Japan a week out from when our cruise leaves in a few days. I don’t have to worry about getting anything ready since she’s been packed for weeks at this point. She just had to wait a little bit so I could get approved medical leave off of work to rest and recover a bit, but we’re doing it. We’re going on her dream vacation. \n\nAll it cost me were parts of my stomach, intestine, and whatever was in my 401k.\n\nI’ve learned my lesson by now. When Karla, the absolute love of my life, wants something, she’ll get it. By any means necessary.",

        "text": "  \n\nI work at Van Hydro Energy Center. Hearing \"hydro energy,\" you might expect a dam built over a river or blocking up a lake, but this place doesn’t follow that logic. No, it was built in the middle of the woods. It uses a near-surface underground waterway or something. I don’t know the specifics beyond that, and I'm honest enough to admit that, as odd as it is, I haven't investigated any deeper. They pay me well, and my job is about as straightforward as they get.\n\nI'll skip all the nonsense since that's not really why you're here and not why I'm writing this, but I have to describe the facility just a bit. Its central building is huge, like one of those enclosed football stadiums, with two wings - north and west. North is just offices and the cafeteria, but the west wing is a lab of some sort. I can't describe it beyond that because we don't go inside it. We patrol its perimeter at night and ensure all the doors are locked, but they don’t give us the keys. If we find any door unlocked, we report it to our boss, who reports it to his boss, and so on, until it's taken care of. Thankfully, I haven’t had to deal with that issue in the four months I’ve been here.\n\nAround the place is a fence topped with barbed wire, with two gates on opposite sides of the facility allowing entry to the parking lot and loading docks. Around all of that, they cleared a perimeter of trees and mowed the grass, placing floodlights to illuminate the field if anything larger than a rabbit moves. It's overkill, I'd thought, but like I said, they pay me well, so I don't complain about them making my job easy.\n\nThere are seven of us on any given shift. Two per security shack next to the gates and three in the security office in the north wing. We rotate between jobs periodically, but the incident that’s got me writing this happened last night. I was in the western shack. Zack was with me. He’s a wiry guy and ex-military, so we had plenty of topics to discuss to pass the long boring hours between perimeter walks and visitors. We hadn't had anyone come by all night, which was typical. There was only one planned stop, and unscheduled arrivals were rare. We'd already done our walk at the beginning of our shift, so we were deep into our conversation, not paying attention to the street.\n\nIt was just past midnight when the floodlights clicked on suddenly, startling the hell out of us. I was on my feet, the chair rolling backward as I rose and looked across the field for whatever had triggered the lights. Thankfully, we had a mostly unobstructed view, with only the far left side of the area masked behind some of the gate's chain links.\n\n“You see anything,” I asked after a moment. Zack hummed a no, similarly on his feet. \n\nWe spent a minute or two staring at nothing by neatly trimmed field before he started to chuckle, “I didn’t think you could jump that high, old man,” he said, cutting the tension.\n\nMy response could have been more appropriate. We chalked the lights up to deer. Tony radioed us from the central office and confirmed that there was nothing on the cameras. We fell back into pleasant camaraderie.\n\nMaybe an hour passed before the radio buzzed again.\n\n“Y’all sure ya didn’t see anything earlier,” Tony asked.\n\n“Nope,” I said, “whatever it was scampered off quick. Why?”\n\nThe radio was silent momentarily before his voice buzzed, “Eric and Amelia have had their floods go off a few times now. Nothin’ on camera, nothin’ in the field. Keep your eyes peeled. If it happens on your end again, we wanna make sure it’s an animal.”\n\nZack exaggeratedly rolled his eyes and I suppressed a grin at it, \"will do, chief,” I responded dutifully before dropping the radio back into its charger.\n\n“What the hell else is it gonna be,” he leaned back in his chair, “we’re too far west for bigfoot, aren’t we?”\n\n“Nope,” I said, popping the p, “pretty sure bigfoot’s west cost.”\n\n“Is he really,” he leaned forward now, looking out the window toward the pitch-black field. It was a cloudy night, and we couldn't see much of anything without the floodlights. The fence's security lights gave us enough light to see maybe ten feet past the road, leaving the other forty feet to the tree line wholly obscured. \"Well, maybe we ought to keep our eyes peeled like the boss man suggests, see ourselves a bigfoot.”\n\nI breathed a laugh out, “and what happens when it is? The camera on your phone's shit. Go around proclaiming bigfoot's out there and people might actually realize you’re an idiot.”\n\n“That’s what the gun is for, Ty,” he said as he waved his hand at the gun case at the back of our shack, “I won’t need a photo if I bring a body.”\n\n“I’m a better shot than you and I have one hand,” I shot back, “You’d be better off…”\n\nI was interrupted as the floodlights sprang to life again. “There,” Zack said immediately.\n\nI’d been carried away with the conversation. By the time I followed his finger there was nothing but brush and trees. \"What was it?”\n\n“No bigfoot, unfortunately,” he said with an overstated huff, “looked like a dog. Pretty big though, maybe a wolf or something.”\n\n“I’d be amazed if it was a wolf, they’re…” I was interrupted again as, down the street, another set of floodlights lit up. I snatched the walkie, \"do we have eyes on the northwest field?\"\n\nThe response was immediate, “nothing on camera. Did you two see anything?”\n\n“Zack thinks he saw a wolf.”\n\nWe waited for several minutes for a response after that. The lights in the field switched off while we waited. The darkness that followed seemed, somehow, deeper than it had before. The hairs on my neck stood as I stared into it.\n\n“Feels like something’s looking at us from out there,” Zack said quietly.\n\nI nodded, not speaking as I kept my eyes glued to the impenetrable wall of black. The longer I stared, the darker it seemed to get, taking over my vision inch by inch.\n\n\"Rangers say there aren’t any packs out this way,” Tony’s voice cut through as I looked down at the radio, “Y’all sure it wasn’t a coyote?”\n\n“That wasn’t a fucken coyote,” Zack said, “It was big. Seventy feet away and it looked big. Coyote don’t get that big.”\n\n“We’re pretty sure it wasn’t a coyote,” I responded.\n\nThe radio was silent again and I set it down. “Anything other than a wolf you think it might’ve been,” I asked as I focused on the darkness again, waiting for the light to snap on again. Zack was a hunter. He bragged about being one, at the very least.\n\n“This far out,” he said with a thoughtful hum, “Coywolf, maybe. I don't think they're common around these parts, though. Malamute or a husky would fit the profile from this distance, too. It was a damn big dog. Not a whole lotta things fit that profile.\"\n\nA light flicked on around the far north side of the complex. Farther than we could see but close enough that we saw the light. Zack and I both stared at it as another near it lit up. Suddenly the field in front of us was bright again and I was on my feet again. My body was tight as my eyes raced across everything, looking for movement. I took in everything in an instant, but the field was empty. \n\nThat there wasn’t nothing there failed to bring me comfort, though. This didn't feel like animals running around in the woods. This felt intentional. This felt prodding. “Are any of those animals smart enough to test a lighting system?\"\n\n“Not a damn one.” Zack moved away from our desk, his keys jangling as he pulled them from his pocket. He opened the safe, pulling out a rifle first, checking it, and slinging it over his shoulder before he did the same with a handgun.\n\nHe handed me a pair of earplugs before he handed me the gun. I took them gratefully. We sat there in our shack for the next half hour. Lights came on and off intermittently, never seeing more than a whooshing of movement as whatever it was ducked back into the cover of the tree line. Tony was on the radio on and off, but he didn’t sound like he had a single clue about what was happening, and every time the radio buzzed I felt the muscles in my back tense and twitch. Nothing happened though. The lights went on and off, but nothing happened.\n\nThen we saw headlights.\n\nI recognized the truck as it pulled toward us. A quick glance at our desk's clock told me it was right on time. The driver turned his truck wide outside the gate and swerved in, bringing the whole trailer behind him. I felt a chill down my spine as a howl sounded from the forest's darkness. Then another and another. They echoed faintly through the glass panes of our little shack, and as Zack pressed the button to shut the gate behind the driver, who was hanging halfway out his window and waving to us, the power went out.\n\n\"Hell,\" I spat out as I moved around Zack and ripped the door open. The emergency power hadn’t turned on yet, but I could see the man from the light of his truck. He was waving like an idiot with his headset on and covering his ears. “Get over here!”\n\nHe shot me a confused look and opened his door, “what’s going on,” he asked, removing his headset and tossing it onto his seat as he took a step down.\n\nI was ripped backward before I could respond. I whirled around to yell, but my words died in my throat when I saw a massive wolf tearing across the street, dimly illuminated in the red glow of the truck's brake lights. Zack pushed passed me roughly, and with a warning shout of \"wolves,\" he pulled the door shut just as the beast reached it. Up close, silhouetted by the semi's light, it was even bigger than I'd thought. I had to ask myself how we'd missed it before, but seeing how fast it was, it wasn't a surprise.\n\nMy heartbeat slammed in my chest as it snarled and clawed at the door. Zack backed away from the door, shouldering his rifle as he fell into line next to me. “That’s the biggest wolf I’ve ever seen,” he said, his voice calmer than his posture.\n\nThe emergency power kicked in and the lights came back on. I wish they hadn't. I'd zeroed in on the monster of an animal in front of me. But, in the darkness, I'd missed the other two in the gate yard. Then, with the light returned, I saw them both just as the larger of the two slammed into the truck driver. He went down fast, his head crashing into the pavement as he hit the ground. The wolf trotted off of him as he lay there dazed. His head swiveled around erratically as he worked his jaw soundlessly.\n\nI let out another curse as the third wolf dove in, its jaws clasping around the man's neck violently, blood pooling on the asphalt under him instantly. I turned away, grabbing the handgun off the desk I'd left it on as I cursed again. \n\n“You’re welcome,” Zack said, his voice still calm.\n\nI wasn’t calm. I could feel my heartbeat in my ears as I whirled around without reason and screamed at the wolf that still stood at our door. I wasn’t thankful he’d pulled me back at that moment. Wasn't grateful that I had to see that man die. Because he was dead. With a neck wound like he was gone.\n\n“What the hell is happening down there,” Tony’s panicked voice came through the radio.\n\nZack got to it first: \" Where did our power go? This is a god damned power plant. How in the hell did we lose power?\" he shouted instead of answering.\n\nI reached out and snatched the radio from his hand, “The driver’s down, bleeding badly,\" I glanced back at the man. He was dead. He wouldn't survive, but I couldn't just do nothing about it. \"We need to get these wolves out of the yard and get EMS in here now. This guy isn’t going to make it without life flight.”\n\n“We need to know why the power went out!”\n\nI rounded on him, \"A guy is dying out there, we can figure out the power later!\"\n\n“Charlie and Kent are on their way to you, hang tight,” Tony said.\n\n“He’s already dead, Ty. You know that.” Zack said. “But those wolves howled and the god damned power went out, we need to know why.” His voice was tight, and his eyes flicked from me to the door behind me.\n\n“It was a coincidence,” I told him. I don’t know if I believe it was, but I still said it because… what else could it have been?\n\n“A coincidence,” he hissed, “they were testing the floodlights. They were trying to get close without us seeing them.”\n\nA wolf slammed against the window of the shack. We both surged away from the impact. Zack aimed his rifle toward the window, and I looked back to the yard beyond the door. The three were still there. They’d given up on the man, though, ignoring the meal that he was to stare at us with their maws agape, blood and saliva dripping from their teeth as their low growl reverberated through the glass.\n\nAnother wolf slammed against the glass, cracks splintering from the bloodstain it left behind as it fell to the ground and sprinted to the darkness again. I saw Zack’s hands twitch as it happened, his finger hovering over the trigger guard. “It’s bulletproof glass,” I said, “they can crack it all day. They're never coming through it.”\n\nAnother wolf impacted the glass, shattering it further. This time, to my dismay, I saw the bolts where the glass was fastened to the building shake.\n\n“They’re gonna break it down,” Zack said as he nodded rapidly, an unhinged smile spreading across his lips. “They’re not gonna shatter it. They're gonna break it off the wall. That’s perfectly normal for a wolf. That’s a thing they do.”\n\nAnother slam came. Then another after that. I squeezed the handle of the gun tightly with every charge. I flinched again when the sound of a gun rang out from the parking lot, and yelping drew my attention back to the three waiting outside our door. One was low to the ground and I could see the spot where it’d been hit.\n\n“They’re here,” I breathed. The truck was in the lot beyond the gate, Charlie out of it already, rifle at his shoulder, while Kent was moving to join him.\n\nAnother wolf hit the window, causing the bent and malformed glass to break free at the top.\n\nMore shots rang out, and, against every instinct, I moved toward the broken window pocketing the pistol as I did and pressed the button to shut the outer gate. The wolf’s yelped as they were fired on, the one that had been first hit falling to the ground as the other two started to flee through the shutting gate. I opened the inner gate as I saw them run. \"Come on, we’re going!”\n\nI opened the door and stepped out, turning to usher Zack past me. He wasn’t there though. He was staring at the broken glass, his eyes wide and terrified. I didn't have time to react past that. The window was hit again, and it caved. A wolf flailed through the broken pane and crashed into him. The rifle went off, but I couldn’t tell if the wolf had been hit. It thrashed around on top of him. I heard him grunt in pain as the wolf righted itself, snarling at me through broken teeth as it faced me. \n\nI thought, at that moment, that it was going to dive at me. It was less than five feet from me. I could feel its breath as it huffed. It didn't though. It reared back and turned, bringing its teeth down on Zack. I pulled my pistol free as quickly as possible and fired until the magazine was empty. Charlie and Kent were with me then, and they helped me pull its body off him. \n\nZack was in bad shape. We moved him quickly, conscious that just shifting him brought out a groan of pain. We got him in the back of the truck. I kneeled awkwardly on the floor between seats, trying to keep him still as Charlie and Kent entered the front and drove away from the gate.\n\nHe was dazed. Delirious, really. He was muttering incoherently as I tried to keep him still. One thing came through clearly, though, and I don't know what it means. \"Not a wolf,\" he said. He said it again and again. Out of order sometimes. But it was some combination of those three words.\n\nWe got to the main building. Eric, Amelia, and Tony were all there and they helped get Zack inside.\n\nNothing happened the rest of the night. No howls, no wolves blowing through windows. Tony and Eric had first aid training, so they tried to take care of Zack, but I was still relieved when I heard the helicopter. I’m at the hospital now. I was covered in Zack’s blood and apparently non-responsive enough that EMS took me with them.\n\nZack's okay. He will be, at least. A lot of new scars but… alive. He’s asleep still. Will be for a while, I imagine. \n\nTony's called me a dozen times, but I haven't answered. I don't know what to say. Everything is so surreal that I can't get Zack's words out of my head. Not a wolf. What did he mean? What did he see that had him so terrified he couldn’t even move? \n\nI’m… not a person that believes in campfire stories. Those wolves were massive, though, and they were brilliant. I know wolves are intelligent, but I've been on my phone all morning reading about them, and they're not *that* smart. They don’t test defenses like that. They sure as hell don't throw themselves at a bulletproof window with so much force that they break it off the wall.\n\nIt wasn't normal. But if that's true, if it was something abnormal, then I don't know what happened last night, and I need to know what happened. I said earlier that this job pays decent. I was underselling it. But, with me being at the end of the story and with my fingers shaking again, I'll say that I'm not in a position where I can afford to lose this job. The thought of going back out there though… Please if anyone knows anything about wolves acting crazy, or being too smart, even if the answer isn’t normal, please contact me. There has to be some explanation for everything that happened. There needs to be.",

        "text": "I work at a garden centre in the UK. It's a quiet job, but it pays the bills. With the Christmas break coming up, the place was nearly empty, and I was the last one to leave. As I headed to the bathroom to take a leak, I realized that I'd left my phone on the desk. So, I went back to get it.\n\nWhen I finished my business, I tried to leave, but the door wouldn't budge. It was jammed shut, and I couldn't seem to open it. I tried kicking it, but that didn't work either. Panic set in as I realized I was trapped.\n\nI began to look around the bathroom to see if there was anything that could help me. All that was in the room was a toilet, a sink, and a light. I had a big coat on, so I wasn't too cold, but the thought of being stuck in the bathroom for two weeks without food or water made me feel sick.\n\nI banged on the door and shouted for help, but no one answered. I tried calling for help on my phone, but I had no signal. The silence was deafening, and I was starting to feel hopeless.\n\nAs the minutes turned into hours, and the hours turned into days, I began to lose track of time. The light started to flicker, and I knew that I was in trouble.\n\nThe days passed by in a blur, and I started to feel as though I was losing my mind. The light in the bathroom finally gave out, and I was plunged into darkness. The only sound was the constant dripping of the faucet, and the cold seeped into my bones.\n\nI tried to ration the water from the sink, but it soon ran out. I was getting weaker by the day, and I knew that I needed to find a way out before it was too late.\n\nIn my dreams, I saw flashes of my past. Memories of my family, my friends, and all the things I'd taken for granted. The warmth of the sun on my skin, the sound of laughter, and the feeling of being alive. But those dreams always turned into nightmares, and I'd wake up screaming.\n\nI tried to keep my mind occupied by talking to myself, singing songs, and trying to remember every detail of my life before I got stuck in the bathroom. But as the days passed by, it was getting harder to remember anything.\n\nI started to see things that weren't there. Shadows that moved across the walls, whispers in the dark, and the feeling of someone breathing down my neck. I knew it was just my mind playing tricks on me, but it didn't make it any less terrifying.\n\nAs the second week drew to a close, I knew that I was running out of time. I could barely move, and I was so weak that I could barely stand up. I knew that I needed to find a way out, but I didn't know how.\n\nI spent what felt like hours trying to pry the door open with my hands and kicking it with my feet, but it was no use. The lock was too strong, and the door wouldn't budge. I was trapped, alone and helpless.\n\nIn my dreams, I saw myself as a small child, lost and alone in a dark forest. The trees were twisted and gnarled, and the ground was covered in a thick layer of fog. I stumbled through the underbrush, searching for a way out, but I couldn't find one. Every time I turned a corner, the forest shifted and changed, and I was lost all over again.\n\nI tried to stay awake as long as possible, but exhaustion would always overcome me eventually. I would drift off into a fitful sleep, only to wake up screaming, drenched in sweat.\n\nThe cold was becoming unbearable, and my body was starting to shut down. I knew that I didn't have much time left, but I couldn't bear the thought of dying alone in that tiny, cramped bathroom.\n\nAnd then, just when I thought all hope was lost, I heard a sound. It was faint at first, barely audible over the sound of the dripping faucet, but as I listened, it grew louder and more distinct. It was the sound of someone moving outside the door.\n\nMy heart leapt into my throat, and I stumbled to my feet, lurching towards the door. \"Hello?\" I shouted, pounding on the wood with my fists. \"Is someone out there? Please help me!\"\n\nThe sound stopped abruptly, and there was a moment of silence before I heard a muffled voice. \"Is someone in there?\" it said. \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"It's me!\" I shouted. \"I'm stuck in here! Please, help me!\"\n\nThere was a pause, and then the sound of something heavy scraping against the wood. A moment later, the lock clicked, and the door swung open.\n\nI stumbled out of the bathroom, blinking in the dim light of the garden centre. There was a man standing there, staring at me in shock. He was wearing a thick coat and a woolly hat, and he was holding a set of keys in his hand.\n\n\"What the hell?\" he muttered. \"How long have you been in there?\"\n\n\"Two weeks,\" I said weakly. \"I was trapped. I couldn't get out.\"\n\nThe man looked at me for a long moment, his expression unreadable. And then, without another word, he turned and walked away, leaving me standing there in the darkness.\n\nMy mind was racing. The water had stopped working a few days ago, and I hadn't had anything to drink since then. I knew I was dehydrated, and I could feel my body slowly shutting down. My thoughts were becoming more and more fragmented, and I found myself unable to distinguish between reality and the vivid dreams that plagued me.\n\nIn my dream, I was back in the garden center, surrounded by lush green plants and colorful flowers. The air was heavy with the scent of fertilizer, and I could feel the warmth of the sun on my skin. But then, everything started to wither and die, the plants turning brown and brittle, the flowers wilting and falling to the ground. And in the midst of this destruction, I saw the figure of a woman, her face twisted into a grotesque mask of pain and anguish.\n\nI woke up with a start, my heart pounding in my chest. I was shivering uncontrollably, and I realized that the temperature in the bathroom had dropped even further. I stumbled over to the sink, hoping to find some water there, but it was bone dry. I was completely alone, trapped in this freezing, barren room, with no hope of escape.\n\nI knew that I was going to die, that I would never make it out of this place alive. But in the depths of my despair, a flicker of hope appeared. Maybe, just maybe, there was a way out. I remembered the thick wall behind the toilet, and I wondered if I could somehow break through it.\n\nI picked up the toilet tank cover and slammed it against the wall, over and over again. The sound echoed through the empty room, but the wall remained intact. I tried kicking it, but my frozen feet barely made a dent.\n\nI collapsed onto the cold, hard floor, tears streaming down my face. I was completely powerless, at the mercy of this cruel and unforgiving world. And then, in the midst of my despair, I heard a sound. A faint scratching, coming from the other side of the wall.\n\nI froze, my heart pounding in my chest. Was it just my imagination, or was someone else here with me? I pressed my ear against the wall, listening intently. And then, I heard a voice, a soft and familiar voice, whispering my name.\n\n\"John, John, can you hear me?\"\n\nIt was my wife's voice, clear as day. I felt a surge of hope, and I started pounding on the wall, desperate to break through. And then, I heard another voice, a voice I had not heard in years.\n\n\"John, it's me, your father. You have to get out of there, son.\"\n\nI felt a chill run down my spine. My father had been dead for over a decade, but here he was, speaking to me from beyond the grave. I tried to block out the voices, to focus on reality, but they wouldn't go away.\n\nIn my dream, the wall began to crack and crumble, and I could see the faces of my loved ones peering through the gap. But then, the wall reformed, solidifying once again, trapping me in this endless cycle of hope and despair.\n\nI screamed in frustration, my voice echoing off the walls. I was losing my mind, consumed by fear and desperation. I didn't know how much longer I could hold on.\n\nDays have passed since I last ate, and I can feel my body growing weaker. My mind is consumed by the vivid hallucinations that have taken over my every waking moment.\n\nAt first, the dreams were just flashes of memory from my life outside of this bathroom. Now, they've become something far more sinister. Every time I close my eyes, I see a world of darkness and chaos.\n\nIn one dream, I'm back at the garden center, wandering aimlessly through the rows of flowers and plants. The sound of the wind echoes through the empty space, and the cold bites at my skin.\n\nSuddenly, I hear a noise. It's coming from the bathroom. I hurry over to investigate, but when I open the door, I find myself face to face with a towering figure. It's made entirely of shadows, and its eyes glow like red-hot embers.\n\nThe creature lunges at me, and I wake up gasping for air.\n\nIn another dream, I'm back in my childhood home. The place is empty, and the walls are covered in peeling wallpaper. I walk down the hallway, and as I do, the floorboards creak beneath my feet.\n\nI hear a whisper, and I turn around to see my mother standing there. But as she gets closer, her face contorts into something twisted and demonic. She reaches out to grab me, and I wake up screaming.\n\nThese dreams are all-consuming, and they've left me feeling like I'm losing my grip on reality. I can't tell what's real and what's not anymore.\n\nMy body aches with hunger and thirst, but the only thing I can think about is escaping the madness that's taken over my mind.\n\nI've lost track of time, but it feels like an eternity since I first became trapped in this bathroom. The temperature has dropped so low that I can see my breath in the air, and my body is weak and trembling with cold.\n\nThe hallucinations have become so intense that I'm starting to believe they're real. In one particularly vivid dream, I'm sitting in the bathroom, staring at the door. Suddenly, I hear a voice on the other side.\n\n\"Hello?\" the voice says. \"Is anyone in there?\"\n\nI rush to the door and try to open it, but it won't budge. \"Help!\" I shout. \"I'm trapped in here!\"\n\nThe voice on the other side doesn't respond, and I begin to panic. I bang on the door with all my might, but it still won't open.\n\nI'm so focused on trying to escape that I don't realize what's happening until it's too late. The walls around me start to close in, crushing me in a vise-like grip. I scream in terror, but there's no one around to hear me.\n\nFinally, after what feels like hours, the walls stop moving. I'm left gasping for air, my body bruised and battered. That's when I realize that I'm not going to make it out of here alive. The thought sends a wave of despair crashing over me. I'm going to die alone in this freezing, dark bathroom, and no one will ever know.\n\nAs I sit there, staring at the walls, I begin to feel a sense of calm wash over me. Maybe this is how it was meant to end, I think. Maybe this is the fate that was waiting for me all along. And then, I hear a sound. It's faint at first, but as it grows louder, I realize that it's the sound of the door unlocking.\n\nMy heart races with hope and adrenaline as I rush to the door. With a loud creak, it swings open, and I'm blinded by the bright light of the outside world. Standing there, looking down at me, is a group of people. They're wearing gardening gloves and carrying shovels and bags of soil.\n\n\"Are you okay?\" one of them asks me.\n\nI can't find the words to respond. All I can do is stare up at them in disbelief.",

        "text": "I let out an annoyed groan as I was shaken awake. I squinted into the red light that was emanating from the flashlight that was pointed directly into my face, trying to see who was jostling me.\n\n“Get dressed.” Recruit Elledge said, keeping the red beam aimed at my face. “You’ve got Firewatch in fifteen minutes.”\n\nIt was my sixth week on Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, and although I had only been there for a little more than a month, it felt as I though I had been there for much longer. Six weeks of sixteen-hour days, filled with Drill, Physical Training, “Incentive Training,” and being berated by sociopath Drill Instructors had made the last six weeks feel like 6 years.\n\nThe only solace I had was that because of my friendship with our platoons Scribe, Recruit Hilker, I was able to avoid being put on Firewatch. The other recruits were aware of this, and berated me for skating, but because they were too scared to go to our Senior Drill Instructor about it, nothing was ever done, and I enjoyed my place in “Skate City.”\n\nThat was until Hilker was dropped from recruit training after failing swim qual the week prior, and was replaced as Scribe by Recruit Hart, who didn’t make his disdain for me a secret. I sat up, sighed, and got up from my rack. Elledge stood rigidly as he silently watched me put on my woodland camouflaged uniform. As per the fifth general order, he was only allowed to go back to bed once he was properly relieved, and he watched to ensure that I wouldn’t just go back to sleep.\n\nOnce I was fully dressed, Elledge handed me that nights firewatch roster. My eyes quickly scanned the paper and my annoyance shifted to anger.\n\nRECRUIT JACKSON 2300 – 0100\n\nI was the only one on the list to have two hours of firewatch. I didn’t realize how much my shitbag behavior upset my fellow recruits. I tried to argue with Elledge, but he told me to shut the fuck up and deal with it, so that was that.\n\nI made my way to the front of the squad bay, where the other two recruits on firewatch were waiting. We exchanged a few words and entered our names into the logbook. I was delegated to post two, which was positioned in front of the head, which in the civilian world is known as a bathroom. My job for the next two hours would be to guard the head and keep a log of everyone who goes in.\n\nI stood and stared into the black abyss that was the head. During the day, the head provided some form of sanctuary, as the Series Commander discouraged the DI’s from going inside while recruits were using it, and aside from a few rare occasions, the Drill Instructors typically wouldn’t bother recruits while they were taking a piss. The head took on a more foreboding form at night though. The lights inside the head were broken, and while a maintenance request had been put in for quite some time, the Marine Corps being the Marine Corps, the lights had yet to be repaired.\n\nBecause of this, at night recruits had to fumble around in the dark with their little flashlights to relieve themselves. It was for this reason that most recruits avoided using the head in the middle of the night, preferring to use it earlier in the evening while there was still some vestiges of sunlight pouring through the windows.\n\nI gazed into the head for only a few moments longer before I turned around and leaned forward over the two footlockers stacked on top of each other making the makeshift desk that was post two. I stood there for a few minutes, trying not to fall asleep when I noticed another piece of paper on the desk. I picked it up an examined it, and read the words written on it.\n\nPOST TWO SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS: 2300 – 0100 CLEAN THE HEAD\n\nI silently cursed to myself. That asshole Hart added specific instructions just for me. He could have had everyone who was delegated to Post two throughout the night clean the head, but he specially made it so I would have to do it, when there would be zero light. I couldn’t risk not doing it because if the actually was dirty, and it was my responsibility to clean it, I would most certainly get fucked up for it.\n\nI cursed Hart’s name as I turned on my flashlight and stepped into the darkness. I stumbled my way to the cleaning closet and grabbed a mop and a bucket. I brought the bucket over to sink built into the ground, built specifically for the purpose of filling up mop buckets. I placed the bucket under the faucet, and as I knelt down to turn the water on, I heard a noise coming from deeper inside the head.\n\nI shot straight up and looked in the direction from where I though the noise came from. I raised my flashlight, but the weak red light it produced did not travel far. I switched to the white lens, but it didn’t improve visibility much. While I couldn’t see anything, I still could hear the noise. I quickly knelt down and turned off the faucet so I could hear it better.\n\nThwack\n\nThwack\n\nThwack\n\nI stood there for a moment, dumbfounded. At first I though I must be going crazy, and that the noise would go away after I had a moment to collect my thoughts. A moment passed, and the noise was still there.\n\nThwack\n\nThwack\n\nThwack\n\nThe uneasy feeling I had since my shift began grew exponentially, and for a moment, I had a strong desire to flee. My brains survival instinct was telling me to get out of the head, to leave the barracks and to get as far away as possible. The more rational part of my brain pushed those thoughts away, and I came to the fairly obvious conclusion that it was most likely another recruit fucking with me.\n\n“Hey,” I said in as loud of a whisper that I could. “What the hell are you doing? Either do your business or get out and go back to bed!”\n\nThwack\n\nThwack\n\nThwack\n\nNo response, just the continued rhythmic sound of something hitting something. Any uneasiness or fear I was feeling was replaced with anger. Now I was getting pissed. First, I got two hours of Firewatch, second, I get tasked out to do some bullshit cleaning, and now I have someone fucking with me.\n\nI walked deeper into the head toward the sound. As I get further into the head, the sound grows louder, and I’m more able to discern more details about it. It sounds… wet. It sounds like someone is hitting a pile of raw meat with a sledgehammer. I know that sounds strange, but imagine what that would sound like. That’s what my first though was when I heard the sound more closely. I knew it obviously couldn’t be that, but the unease that I had felt earlier had begun to return. What could this guy be doing to make that noise?\n\nTHWACK\n\nTHWACK\n\nTHWACK\n\nI walked a bit further, and I was able to determine where the noise was coming from. I turned my head to the left and looked into an open doorway. The shower. The head was divided into three walled off sections. On the ride side of the head was where the urinals and toilets were. In the center of the head was where the sinks were, and on the left side was the showers.\n\nTHWACK\n\nTHWACK\n\nTHWACK\n\nI turned my body to face the opening and was about to step inside when suddenly the noise stopped. It didn’t fade away, it didn’t gradually go away, it just stopped. That made me stop in my tracks. I stood there for a moment, wondering who was in the shower, and what he was doing. I made one last attempt to speak to whoever was in there.\n\n“Who’s in here?” I whispered. No response. With that, I took a deep breath, and I walked inside the shower.\n\nThe shower, like the rest of the head, was dark. The darkness was made even worse by the lack of windows. I shined my flashlight across the width of the room, and I saw nothing. At this point I was just confused. There was nothing in here! I racked my brain for ideas as to how whoever was in here managed to get out without me seeing them. Maybe he somehow snuck past me? As I thought about how whoever this was got away, I absent mindedly took a step forward, and I nearly tripped on something. I stumbled but caught myself. Without thinking, I pointed my flashlight at the ground to see what I tripped on, and upon seeing it, I let out a scream.\n\nThere, laying at my feet, was the broken and battered body of what appeared to be a recruit. He wore the green-on-green pt uniform we exercise in, or at least it used to be green. It was stained with what I could only assume was his blood. His arms and legs were bent in awkward angles, and the fingers on his hands were much the same. His face was the worst. He had no face, not anymore. His head was caved in, as if it was stomped on over and over again, by multiple different people.\n\nI turned around and ran. I ran out of the shower and straight out of the head. I was trying to get to the Duty DI’s office to report what I saw, but as I was halfway across the squad bay, someone grabbed me from behind. I was about to scream even louder when the hand of my assailant covered my mouth.\n\n“Shhhh” Recruit Jewell said through his teeth. “What the fuck are you doing? Are you trying to wake up the whole building?” Recruit Jewell was the rover, it was his job to patrol the squad bay and make sure everyone was okay.\n\nWhat I responded with must have been unintelligible babble. Because Jewell and Recruit Lewis, the recruit stationed at Post One, who had made his way over to us to see what was going on, couldn’t understand. As I tried to find the words, I noticed that a few recruits had sat up in their racks, undoubtedly woken up by my screaming. They took a look around the squad bay, then promptly fell back asleep. I took a minuet to regain my composure, and upon doing so, I explained what I saw.\n\n“There’s a dead person in the shower!” I said, surely looking crazy.\n\n“What are you talking about?” Jewell asked, looking at me as if I had lost my mind.\n\n“There’s a dead person in the shower!” I repeated. “I heard a noise coming from the shower, and when I went to investigate, I found a body!”\n\nJewell and Lewis stared at me for a moment, stunned by the information that had just received. Recruit Lewis that abruptly said, “Show us.”\n\nI turned around and led them through the head and to the showers. I paused before entering, mentally preparing myself for the horrible sight I was about to see. Recruit Jewell didn’t pause before entering, walked straight passed me, followed closely by Recruit Lewis. A few seconds passed, then I heard Lewis say,” Where is he?”.\n\n“What?” I said as I stepped inside.\n\n“Bro, are you fucking with us?” Jewell said, his voice filled with malice. “There’s nothing in here!”.\n\nHe was right. The body was gone.\n\n“It-it was right here!” I said, pointing to the spot where the corpse was laying just minuets ago.\n\n“You must have imagined it.” Lewis said, sounding more annoyed than anything.\n\nI stood there dumbfounded. Jewell and Lewis walked past me out of the shower. I heard Jewell mutter something about how we’d be screwed if my screaming had woken up Sergeant Reeve, the duty Drill Instructor for tonight.\n\nI stood alone in the showers for a few minutes, staring at the spot where the body was. “Maybe I did imagine it?” I thought to myself. It was possible. I had been under an immense amount of stress for the past few weeks, the most amount of stress I’ve been under in my life, in fact. Perhaps the stress was causing me to hallucinate. Some of the other recruits have mentioned seeing and hearing things. Why would I be any different? I let out a sigh, gave the spot where the body was one last look, and turned around and left the showers.\n\nI took the mop and the bucket and put it back in the supply closet. I was so shaken up by the night’s events, that I couldn’t bring myself to clean. I didn’t care if I got in trouble for it in the morning. I was just going to stand at my post for the rest of my shift. I stepped up to the makeshift desk, and leaned over it. A few minuets past, and I remembered how tired I was. I was about to doze off, when I heard a familiar sound coming from the darkness behind me.\n\nTHWACK\n\nTHWACK\n\nTHWACK\n\nThe weeks went on, and training continued. I told some of my friends about what I had saw, but they too told me that I had imagined it. That wasn’t the last night I would have firewatch. In fact, it seemed like I had it almost every night. Hart really fucking hated me. I would always try to be the rover or be stationed at post one, so I could stay as far away from the head as possible. If I had to be at post two, I would just stand with my back facing the head and try to ignore the noises that would emanate from the darkness. On a few occasions, I would turn my head and gaze into the darkness, and I swear to God, I could just barely see the broken face of that recruit, standing distant enough for me to just barely see him. I would try to get the other guys on firewatch to listen for the noise, or to see the recruit standing in the head, but they would never hear or see him. I was tempted to bring this up to a Drill Instructor, but I quickly realized that they would probably think I was trying to act crazy in an attempt to get separated from training on the grounds of mental illness, so I dropped that idea.\n\nI eventually gave up trying to get others to see the recruit, and I learned to live with his presence. The noise wouldn’t go on for my entire shift, just for a few minutes or so. And he never seemed to leave the head. There were occasions were people went into the head during my shift on nights where I heard the sounds, and they came out just fine, so he must not have been violent. Ignoring him seemed to work, so that’s what I did for the rest of training.\n\nAfter weeks of suffering, at long last, I had done it. I had persevered through many grueling weeks of hiking, PT, rifle ranges, and the final test, The Crucible, and I had earned the title of United States Marine. That’s not the only thing I had earned. Our Senior Drill Instructor had discovered that Hart hadn’t been putting his and his friends names on the firewatch roster, and as punishment, he was fired from being the Scribe, and he was replaced by none other than myself!\n\nI had decided to get back at Hart by doing what he did to me; I gave him two hours of firewatch and gave him special instructions to clean the head. I did it mostly to annoy him, as it would be hard to clean the head in the pitch dark, and apart of me also hoped he sees and hears what I would hear every time I had firewatch. I went to bed that night feeling a smug sense of satisfaction.\n\nThe next morning I was woken up by the screams of terror that were coming from the head. As I got out of my rack, I saw that there was a crowd of Privates and PFC’s pushing into the head. I pushed my way through the crowd, and I when I reached the front of it, I saw what was causing the alarm, and when I saw it I gasped.\n\nThere, splayed out on the floor of the shower, were the battered remains of what appeared to be a Marine Private. His woodland cammies were drenched in blood, and his limbs were bent in impossible angles. His head was almost completely caved in. If it wasn’t for the nametape on the right side of his shirt that read “HART”, there wouldn’t have been a way to identify him.\n\nDrill Instructor Sergeant Reeve pushed through the crowd, and upon viewing the gruesome scene before him, I heard him say, “Jesus Christ, not again.”\n\nThe rest of the day was a blur. Military Police came, and we had to take all our stuff out of the barracks. The entire company was taken out of that building, and we spent the remainder of our time on Parris Island in a different barracks. Apparently NCIS launched an investigation, and it lasted less than a day. They claim that Hart had committed suicide, which is fucking absurd. Our Senior DI sat us down and told us that an order had come down all the way from the Commandant of the Marine Corps that we weren’t allowed to talk about what had happened. I can’t remember everything he said, but he used words like “NJP” and “Court martial” and “Dishonorable Discharge” when describing the consequences of telling people about what had happened.\n\nThat was years ago, and I had tried to push the events of what had happened out of my mind, and I thought I had succeeded. That was until recently. I was sent back to Parris Island to work as a Range Coach. Earlier today, I was inspecting a recruits rifle when I overheard two other recruits talking.\n\n“You’re full of shit, man.” One said to the other. “There’s no way that happened.”\n\n“I swear to God, it was real!” The other said. “He was in the shower! He was covered in blood! It looked like he was beaten to death!",

I saw endless carnage on the street. Multiple cars had crashed into buildings, garages and fences, and my neighbor’s house was now an inferno of fire that sent out billowing black clouds into the air. Further down the street, I heard explosions. They were coming from the direction of the nearby gas station.\n\nI quickly shepherded my wife and daughter to the backseats, slamming the door and running up front to the driver’s seat, laying the shotgun on the passenger seat pointing towards the door. Backing out of the driveway, I nearly ran over my neighbor. She had hobbled out of the backyard of the burning house, waving her arms at me and shrieking something incomprehensible. Putting down the window, I pulled right up next to her.\n\nMrs. Lukas was a widow who lived alone. Her husband of forty years had been killed the previous year. He always volunteered to help the poor in the inner city, cooking at soup kitchens and trying to connect the homeless with social services as part of his church community outreach program. One night when he was leaving the soup kitchen, some thug had shot him in the chest and stolen his wallet while he bled to death on the sidewalk. Cameras had caught a fuzzy image of the young man, but he was never identified. Mrs. Lukas had never fully recovered from the death of her husband, but my family and I regularly went over to check on her and spend time with her.\n\n“Mrs. Lukas,” I said, putting down my window. She nodded at me, tears brimming in her eyes.\n\n“My house,” she said simply, pointing to the blazing structure fire behind her. “Everything I owned was in there.”\n\n“We need to get out of here, Mrs. Lukas,” I said, pointing to the empty passenger’s seat. My wife and daughter joined in the chorus, saying, “Come on, Mrs. Lukas, come with us.” She wiped the tears out of her eyes, limping slowly around the car and getting into the seat slowly, sighing as she did so. As soon as she slammed the door shut, I pulled off quickly, the tires squealing. I wanted to get as far away from the fires and carnage as I possibly could, if there was anywhere to go.\n\nAs I drove down the road, the fire of Mrs. Lukas’ house getting further and further behind us, a massive explosion rocked the street. A small mushroom cloud of black smoke peaked above the houses further ahead.\n\n“Oh God, that was the gas station, wasn’t it?” my wife asked. I looked in the rearview mirror. She was holding my daughter, who looked shell-shocked, staring straight ahead without seeing.\n\n“Yes, I think that was the gas station,” I agreed. I wanted to avoid that area, so I turned left, taking side streets. I knew a few ways out of town through little-traveled forest roads. I didn’t know if the military would be blocking major thoroughfares, and I really didn’t want to find out. I still had hope that they wouldn’t have every small dirt road that wound through fields or forests blocked off, however.\n\nAs we drove further away from the houses past tobacco fields that extended for acres on both sides of us, Mrs. Lukas started making strange coughing noises. It sounded like she was choking. I looked over and saw her bent over in her seat. I couldn’t see her face, but she looked like she was in agony, trying to curl up into a fetal position as much as her old body could allow. I pulled the car over quickly, parking in front of a barn.\n\n“Mrs. Lukas?” I said, putting my hand on her shoulder.\n\n“Please,” she said between choking sobs, “water.” I ran out of the car, taking the shotgun with me for good measure, and opened the backdoor. My wife quickly passed me a bottle of water, and I handed it to Mrs. Lukas. She quickly sat up and started chugging the whole thing rapidly. She didn’t look good.\n\nHer face was turning a strange yellow color, like the jaundiced face of a lifelong alcoholic, and her hands were clenched into tight fists. I could see small trickles of blood where her fingernails bit into her palms.\n\nAs soon as she finished the water, she sat there, hyperventilating for a moment. I thought she was crying, but then I realized one of her eyes had a trickle of blood running down from it. She turned to look at me, and I saw her pupils were different sizes. One of them was fully dilated, and the other was a tiny pinpoint. I backed away instinctively.\n\n“I’m sorry,” she said, seeming to regain some control over herself, “I don’t know what came over me. It must be all the stress of the day…”\n\n“Mrs. Lukas,” I asked, “you didn’t drink the tap water, did you?” She looked at me sideways.\n\n“Of course I drink the water from my house, young man,” she said, her other eye beginning to bleed now too, “but I filtered it. Don’t you know drinking bottled water is bad for the environment? Too much trash in the landfills and the oceans.” She shook her head slowly and lazily from side to side as she spoke. Her voice seemed to deepen and gurgle. I looked back at my wife and daughter.\n\n“Get out of the car,” I whispered, a sense of horror overtaking me, but it was too late. A gray, sickly-looking tendril shot out of Mrs. Lukas’ mouth. It began to whip around wildly, my wife and daughter screaming as they felt for the door handles. Mrs. Lukas’ arms began to make strange snapping noises, lengthening as she raised them towards me. It looked like the bone and joints were being broken and re-forming in front of my eyes, purplish bruises and bursting capillaries forming all up and down on the skin of her arms. Her fingers were turning black, the nails turning blue, as if she were dying or already dead. I backed up out of the car slowly, raising the shotgun. My wife and daughter still weren’t out of the car, but I was out of time.\n\n“Get down!” I yelled at them, hoping they heard me in time. Then I pulled the trigger.\n\nThe slug blew a hole the size of a grapefruit in Mrs. Lukas’ chest, then kept going, shattering the passenger side window. Her mouth opened, the jaw disengaging like a snake’s as she hissed, spewing a fountain of blood towards me. I moved at the last second, and the projectile bloody vomit missed my face by mere inches, falling harmlessly in the corn field behind me.\n\nThe smell of gunpowder mixed with something else that I had never smelled before. It was a smell like vomit and ammonia mixed together, and it got stronger the closer I was to the tendrils. A black fluid with iridescent rainbows shimmering in it leaked out of the damaged tendrils around her chest, tiny worms swarming and writhing in the alien blood as it soaked the seat and floor of the SUV.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n\nMy ears were ringing from shooting the shotgun, but I could hear the muffled sounds of my wife and daughter still screaming. I pulled open the back door and yanked Sarah out, then gave Beth a hand. Small, red tendrils erupted out of Mrs. Lukas’ chest, languidly feeling around the windshield and back seat before seeming to run out of energy, falling limply to the floor of the car. \n\n“Is Mrs. Lukas alright?” Sarah asked in her little voice, looking up at me. She had her little pink backpack on. My wife kneeled down next to her and whispered something in her ear. It felt like I couldn’t talk. I just stood there, breathing fast, my vision covered in a white shimmering as waves of adrenaline and anxiety overtook me.\n\nI did not want to get back into that car. I didn’t know how contagious the blood was, but I remembered the warning on the radio- “Don’t even wash your hands with the water.” Could touching contaminated blood infect me or my family? I didn’t know, and I didn’t want to find out.\n\n“Come on,” I said, grabbing the bags from the back seat and handing them to my family, “we’re walking from here. It might be better anyway. The military might be tracking cars by helicopter or satellite.” I remembered seeing movies where evil corporations or governments shot anyone who tried to escape a quarantine area, and shivers ran down my spine.\n\n“Jason, look,” my wife said in horror, pointing behind me. I looked at the spot where her trembling finger pointed.\n\nThe projectile blood that Mrs. Lukas had vomited before her death had settled into the dirt. A few earthworms writhed on top of the soil, elongating and mutating in front of my eyes. Within seconds, they had grown to a couple feet long, sharp red spikes extruding through their slimy skin. Tiny eyes on stalks were sprouting from the fronts of their bodies at an incredible speed, dozens of little black orbs that vibrated and searched the surrounding environment. Then new mouths opened beneath the eyes, with teeth as thin as needles poking out from their searching maws.\n\n“Get back,” I said, trying to push my family back from the mutating worms. The worms all responded to the sound of my voice, raising their heads like snakes who smell prey, and a few began slithering in my direction. “Run!” We all started sprinting down the street. The worms creeped behind us at an unbelievable pace, almost catching up with me even as I sprinted as fast as I could. As my family and I all ran for our lives, I chambered a round of buckshot in the shotgun, then turned rapidly and shot at the few worms behind us.\n\nThe spread of the shotgun blast took out all three of them, stopping them instantly. Tendrils a few inches long shot out of their bodies, searching for a moment before falling onto the pavement. I put another round of buckshot in the chamber for good measure, but nothing else moved around us.\n\nThen I heard a strange humming coming from further down the road. I turned to my wife.\n\n“Do you hear that?” I asked in a low voice. She nodded.\n\n“It almost sounds like a Tibetan singing bowl,” she said. I looked at her blankly. “It is a resonant bowl used for meditation that produces a humming sound.” Beth knew all about yoga and meditation. \n\n“I don’t like it,” I said. Walking forward slowly, I saw a crowd of people standing around in a circle in a grassy field, all of them with their mouths opened, their faces pointing up at the sky. The writhing tendrils of the infection burst out of their skins, endlessly searching in the warm air. Sometimes the tendrils would wrap around one another, and towards the center of the circle, one thick vine sent out from the chest of every monster intertwined. A smell like starter fluid and vomit rose from the group, so pungent that I could almost taste it.\n\nBefore I knew what was happening, I felt the muzzle of a rifle push into the side of my head. A man dressed in all black was hiding at the edge of the tobacco field. He had used my temporary distraction to gain the advantage over me.\n\n“Drop the gun, slowly,” he whispered through his gas mask. “And don’t make a sound. If you draw those things over here, you and your family will surely die.” He spoke calmly, equally, as if he were stating a fact rather than making a threat. I slowly put my hands up, the shotgun loosely held in my right one, then tossed the shotgun in a patch of grass. It fell with a soft thud. None of the members of the mutated group noticed the sound, however.\n\n“Do you see them?” the man with the gun whispered to me. “They’re forming a hive mind. They’re exchanging genetic materials. This thing evolves fast.”\n\n“How do you know?” I asked, and he only chuckled.\n\n“Come on,” he said, lowering his gun. “You and your family are to come with me. There is a scientific installation nearby that is still quarantined and secure. We’re taking the uninfected survivors there until we get new orders.” I looked behind me at my family, going over to join them. His words struck a chord of anxiety in me, “until we get new orders”, but I wasn’t sure why.\n\n“What’s your name?” I asked the man quietly.\n\n“You can just call me X,” he said. “And I already know yours, Jason. We have been monitoring cameras located all over the town, as well as tracking the movement of vehicles by satellite. The government plans to restore order in this town block by block, and if it can’t be done, then the place will be wiped off the map. There can be no risk of this thing spreading beyond here.” Behind X, in the tobacco fields, I saw two more soldiers dressed in all black. They were also wearing gas masks and carrying M4 carbines with sound suppressors screwed in at the ends. X nodded at them and made some sort of hand gesture, and the two other soldiers fell in at both sides of myself and my family.\n\nIt involved going through the field on the opposite side of the road as the hive of monsters. As we moved, the crunching of our feet on the grass the only sound besides that humming coming from the field, I realized the sky was darkening. Flashes of lightning lit up the horizon.\n\nI heard someone screaming from the field across the road. My first thought was that one of the monsters had spotted us and was alerting its fellows as to our presence. All of us whipped around, the soldiers raising their weapons, but I quickly realized it was highly unlikely any of the monsters could even see us. We were hidden behind a curve in the tobacco field, looking through some of the plants to observe them. And the rapid darkening of the sky would likely make it even harder to spot our silhouettes.\n\nInstead of the monsters looking for others outside their group, two new ones were bringing someone in. I squinted, trying to see harder. The prisoner looked like a skinny young man or maybe a teenager. He had wiry black hair and glasses. He shrieked and fought against his captors the entire way, but they easily overpowered him. The tendrils of the captors had wrapped around his arms and hands, like living chains. They otherwise did not touch him, except for a small gray vine that would escape from one of their mouths, caress the hostages cheeks and forehead, then disappear back into the host’s body. It almost gave me the impression that the hive mind wanted to keep him calm, or maybe it was just sampling the goods.\n\nAs soon as the hostage was within a few feet of the group, the circle scattered, seeming to regain much of their individuality. The prisoner looked around feverishly, then seemed to notice our group. I don’t know if it was the glint of some light off one of the rifles or some flash of color from our clothing, but he looked right at us. Then he began screaming, the vines wrapping faster and faster around his legs.\n\n“Help me!” he said, trying to point as a gray tendril wrapped around his mouth, gagging him. The monsters in the group noticed his agitation and yelling and also looked over in our direction. I was trying to crouch lower to the ground. The soldiers were feverishly whispering to each other. Then, as one member gnawed open a red tendril with his bare teeth, others began running in our direction. I saw the gray tendril wrapped around the hostage’s mouth pull away, and the one issuing the black fluid took its place. It forced the young man to drink, wrapping underneath his lips as fluid spurted out of it in an arterial fashion. I nearly gagged just watching it.\n\n“We have to go!” X said to me, the first glint of excitement and bloodlust in his eyes. I stood up quickly, watching Sarah and Beth jog in front of me, hand-in-hand, as X led the way. The other two soldiers stayed behind us, and I caught glimpses of them checking our backs multiple times. The monsters were gaining on us, and if we were going much farther, I had a feeling we wouldn’t make it- at least not without a gunfight.\n\nThose nearest to us out of the group began to run at a superhuman speed. My daughter could not keep up with the soldiers, so I picked her up and began to sprint. It was clear that we were not getting away. Then I heard sniper rifles begin shooting from the forest up ahead, and I sighed in relief, my heart bursting in my chest from the effort of sprinting while carrying a 40-pound child and a backpack full of supplies.\n\nThe forest was only thirty or forty yards away. The soldiers stopped, let my wife and I pass by, then began to open fire with their rifles. The gunshots were deafening, even though none of them were using full-auto bursts. Between the hidden snipers and the three soldiers, they were taking down five or six of the mutated people every few seconds. There was a screaming sound from one of the monsters, like a wailing infant, and the rest of the group immediately stopped and scattered in all directions. A few more shots rang out and a couple more bodies fell across the field, but then everything was quiet. \n\nAll I could hear was the ringing in my ears and the heavy breathing of my daughter and myself. I got a bottle of water out of the backpack, drinking the whole thing and giving another bottle to her. She just stared at it for a few seconds.\n\n“Are we getting out of here?” she asked. My wife looked down at her in surprise.\n\n“Of course we are getting out of here,” my wife said. “Why would you think otherwise?” My daughter pointed to the dead bodies littering the field.\n\n“None of those people are getting out of here,” Sarah said. I saw the three soldiers entering the forest. X was looking at us with an inscrutable expression.\n\n“We have a much larger group headed this way,” he said to us. “Satellite imagery shows it may have over five hundred people. Apparently the first phase has ended, and the second has begun.”\n\n“What do you mean by ‘first phase’?” my wife asked him. He shrugged.\n\n“The chaotic nature of the transformations, some of the mutants ripping others apart. Total psychotic breakdowns in predisposed individuals. All of that kept them disorganized, easy to kill as long as you had weapons. But if they are forming into larger and larger hiveminds, then that will not continue. It means our time to get out of here is quickly running out.” He started walking forward again, motioning for us to follow. “But luckily, the scientific installation is only a few hundred yards away. We have time to get there and barricade it, if necessary. They may not even know where it is or how to find it.”\n\n“There’s nothing out this way,” I replied. “This is all woods and fields for the next few miles, and then you get to the national park, which is another twenty miles of forests.” X shook his head, smiling slightly.\n\n“You’ll see.” The other two soldiers didn’t talk at all. They looked unhappy and were reloading their guns. We followed X on a deer trail, and a few minutes later, entered an abandoned barn. He walked directly to the center of it, clearing off ancient-looking hay and twigs, and revealed a number pad, where he entered a series of numbers so fast that I couldn’t follow the sequence. There was a quiet beeping sound, and a round, concrete entrance opened up, revealing a ladder that went into a well-lit hallway a story below.\n\nWe climbed down one by one. My wife, daughter and I were redirected into a room with a couch and a television. The cable and power down here had apparently never been affected like it was in the rest of the town. I opened up my phone and found that they had open wifi access down here, and began to write up my story. \n\nAfter a few minutes, the soldiers came back, all of them having a sour expression on their faces.\n\n“The head scientists are MIA, for now,” X said, frowning. “We will have to wait. I have no idea where they are or what they’re doing. They were supposed to wait here for rescue. Part of my orders are to get them out of here.” I nodded to him, handing out peanut butter crackers and water to my family while I finished writing the story on my phone. X didn’t seem to notice or care.\n\nAcross the facility, I heard another beeping sound, and the faint noise of a door opening. The echo of muffled voices reached out to us across the polished hallways and laboratory rooms. \n\nApparently, the wait was over.",

        "text": "I was feeling under the weather so I decided to call in to work and let them know I wouldn’t make it in. I plopped myself down on the couch, turned on an old episode of Futurama, and stayed in that seat all day, only getting up for Gatorade and Dayquill, my customary cold treatment. I had the next few days off, so by the time of my next shift, I was only dealing with the death throughs of congestion, I would be working that day. After a few minutes, my manager came up to me with a concerned expression.\n\n“You alright? You seemed really out of it Wednesday, almost like you were in a daze.”\n\n“Yeah, I’m fine now, just a head cold.” I said, wondering how she picked that up from a phone call.\n\n“You really shouldn’t come in when you’re sick.”\n\n“I didn’t, I called out.”\n\n“You called out but you still showed up on time, looking like death incarnate. I tried sending you home but you didn’t even react. I was really worried, but you look fine now.”\n\n“I’m reasonably certain I watched futurama on the couch all day.”\n\n“That’s concerning, maybe see a doctor about your memory.”\n\nI, believing this to be a strange misunderstanding, acquiesced to end the uncomfortable conversation, with no actual intention of going to the doctor. The interaction stuck in my memory and I couldn’t stop thinking about it all day, trying to figure out what could have happened but nothing made sense. I ran the scenario over and over in my mind, I couldn’t think of anything else. At the end of my wits, I decided to run a test the next day.\n\nAfter calling in, I parked in the back of the lot and watched the entrance of the building, and right as my shift was scheduled to start, I saw it. A cold shiver ran down my spine like icy water, my heart pounded deafeningly in my ears as I watched myself walk down the street, toward the front door of my place of work. I was cemented in place, entirely unable to move, just staring as this pretender walked by. For whatever reason, the part that got me, the part that really upset me, truly made me angry, was that it walked like me, somehow it knew me and it knew how to copy me perfectly. My state of static panic was quickly replaced by a state of active panic when the thing that wanted to take my place snapped its head in my direction, making eye contact.\n\nThe new adrenaline pumping into my veins shattered the concrete that held me in place, and as my doppelgänger changed course to where I was parked, I regained the wherewithal to shift into drive and tear across the mostly empty parking lot out to the nearby highway. By the time I calmed down, I was nearly two hundred miles and several state lines away. A rest stop sign appeared against the already-darkening horizon and, thinking of my suddenly very heavy eyelids, I deemed I was far enough away that I could catch a few hours of sleep and figure out a plan. The moon was merely a sliver, unable to pierce the dense forest, the trees seemed to be a great dark wall that ominously encircled the rest stop, making it seem like the lights of the rest stop created a tiny island in an ocean of inky blackness. The ominous setting, however, was not enough to combat my exhaustion and I ended up drifting into a light, dreamless sleep. \n\nWell into the late hours of the night, my sleep was broken by a quiet but unmistakable tap on my car window, just one. Immediately, the implications of such a noise crashed into my half-asleep brain, forcing me wide awake in seconds. Slowly, reluctantly, I forced my head up to find the source of the noise. As my gaze leveled on the driver’s window, my worst fears were proven true. My eyes met with their dark copies, nestled into an all too familiar face, the blank expression was unmoving, seeming to be etched in stone. I thought about starting my car and gunning it, but I already did that, 200 miles ago, and it got me nothing but isolation. Clearly, I wasn’t going to outrun this thing, and I was unbearably curious, so I did something truly stupid, I cracked the window to talk.\n\n“What do you want?” I said, fear making my voice crack like I was 12 again, living out my middle school hell.\n\n“I…wa.n..t…….m.ore..”\n\nThat voice, it felt wrong, it wasn’t just off, it was hollow, so much less than human. I can’t explain what it was, but something was missing, some key element of speech was conspicuously absent, something so fundamental to humanity it could be considered an expression of the soul. His words felt like a black and white approximation of what people talking might sound like if you were hearing it for the first time and were unfamiliar with the nuances that every language, every dialect has in vast abundance. It seemed impossible for such sounds to be coming out of a human, yet here it was coming out of not just any human, but a copy of myself. Once it finished its uncanny speech, it shot out a hand towards the window, shattering it with seemingly no resistance, and clasped an iron grip around my throat.\n\nA million thoughts ran through my head at once but one idea was loud enough to be heard over the confusion, *Escape*. And so I did. Never breaking eye contact, I reached for the pen I knew had fallen weeks ago between the seats and by some miracle I found it. As my vision darkened, I uncapped the pen with one hand and jammed the makeshift weapon into the unholy abomination’s forearm and it let out an ear-shattering shriek that sounded more like a power tool cutting through metal than anything a living being could produce. Its fingers unclasped themselves from my trachea long enough for me to start the car and I tore the hell out of there. Unfortunately, the gas gauge eluded my attention and I was stranded on the side of the deserted freeway in the absolute middle of the night within half an hour, of course with no reception. \n\nI knew it was coming, I could feel it, and this time I would be ready. I piled up a bit of junk I had in the car and threw a blanket over it, giving the illusion someone was hiding in the back seat, before creeping into the woods, finding a big stick, and treading lightly into the woods behind a particularly large bush. There I sat, waiting. This thing wanted my life, it wanted to be me, I’m not sure what its plans were but I was pretty sure I wasn’t a part of them for very long. I sat wound like a clock, ready to spring my improvised trap on my hopefully unsuspecting predator. Each muscle tensed to its breaking point, my nerves on a knife’s edge.\n\nAfter what felt like forever, I heard that familiar single tap on glass and knew it was now or never, live or die, kill or be killed. As silently as humanly possible, I climbed from my hiding place and crept toward the figure facing into the window. Right as I brought the branch down, it turned to face me, but it was too late. I watched as roughly a meter of pine turned my own face into a mess of a black, tar-like substance, and skin that shattered like porcelain. Watching the black goo seep out of the gaping hole in my face and onto the pavement, I shuttered, hoping I would never see anything like it again.\n\nI dumped my own body in the woods and drove home, I showed up to work the next day. I literally killed myself and now I need to pretend like everything is normal, like I didn’t meet something out of The Twilight Zone. How, how do I act normal now?  How do I move on from something like that? How do I ever relax again? I find myself constantly looking over my shoulder and getting jumpy over everything. I don’t think I’ll ever be the same.",

        "text": " I had been living paycheck to paycheck back in my hometown but when my current job let me go I had to move. The rent was too high for me to pay along with basic amenities and paying for my family. That was until they left me. My wife who I had loved as well as my 2 very dear children. I remember that day still perfectly like a scar in my mind leaving that horrible mark forever. I had some money left then so I decided to look for cheap houses under 50k. That's when I found this seemingly perfect town secluded in the middle of nowhere with jobs available for me. The house was already finished from the inside coming with all the furniture, a TV and the ability to have it changed for free for the first week of moving,\n\nAs I made the turn off the highway, with the few remaining items I had in the trunk of this rusty old car, to the remote little town I was still wondering how I got the property for so cheap. It looked like a perfect little town with an even better community of people in it. There was no reason that house should have gone for anything less than a couple hundred thousand especially not for $1,200. The listing said that there were some rules that we would have to follow when we moved into that town but I thought it would be ok. After all, every community has some rules. Still, it was all a little Macabre as I entered the town.\n\nUpon turning into the street of my new house I saw the trees full of fruit and green grass with perfectly paved roads. With a clear sky with the sun beaming down on the quaint little town I thought that maybe just maybe, I could turn my whole life around. I made a mental note to collect some of the fruit from the trees in my new lawn as I parked my car in the driveway heading to the front door. I took out all the items from my trunk lining them in front of the door to see that the key was left in the lock only. Turning it I heard a click as the door unlocked for me to push it open. I took my stuff inside and intended to unpack after I took a tour of my new house and met some neighbours when a piece of paper on the table in the living room caught my eye. As I moved closer saw it had some stuff written on it so I picked it up. It read:\n\n\"Welcome! I see you are the new residents of our town after the unfortunate incident that happened to the previous tenants of your house.\n\nSome rules are to be followed at all times in this town with more specific rules that you will be getting for other things such as school and your house though you do not need to worry about these for at least your first month.\n\nThis month all you need are these rules I will provide you about the town. It is of utmost importance you follow every rule given to you lest you want to end up like the previous residents.\n\n1.Always be home inside by latest 10 pm to 6 am, every night. This is non-negotiable and probably the most important rule for you to follow because this is when The Creatures hunt in the town.\n\n1a. If you are unable to get home in that time you may take shelter anywhere else you can find such as your office or another resident's house after taking permission. Most offices will have a bed in case you can't leave in time.\n\n2. You must keep your curtains closed at night because The Creatures can peer inside. The Creatures hate wasting time so they won't go into houses that they know aren't currently used. They know yours just got recently...vacated so they probably won't check it for the first week but still better to be safe than sorry!\n\n3. If someone you encounter seems off in any way whatsoever. DO NOT give them attention. You may acknowledge them silently but don't yell it out loud or make eye contact with them after you notice something off.\n\n3a. If you notice something is off while talking to them it's best to give an excuse and walk away from them as quickly as possible cutting them or yourself off. The excuse doesn't have to be the best just good enough for you to leave The Creatures aren't very intelligent.\n\n4. Keep the number of knocks in mind every time someone is there. If it is less than 2 knocks DO NOT open the door. It is one of The Creatures trying to get into your house. If it is over 2 you can open the door for another resident.\n\n4a. At night (10 pm - 6 am) this rule is reversed. We do not know why but it is probably to trick you into opening the door for you.\n\n5. If you hear your doorbell ring, never answer it. We haven't installed doorbells in any houses.\n\n6. This town may look beautiful with all the orchards and fresh fruits that you will not be able to identify growing but do not eat them. THEY get very mad and will come after you. Trust me they know who took their fruit. That's how I lost my wife.\n\n7. If The Creatures manage to get to you please refrain from killing yourself, you will die none the less but go out the honourable way fighting and we may be able to save you in time or they may decide not to kill you if they are few due to splitting up on very rare occasions.\n\n8. Where there is one there are many.\n\n9. You may hear scratching from a room in your house sort of like a hairbrush on rough fabric. Read any religious scripture you believe in be it the Quran, Bible or any other religious book/text. The Creatures do not like any of them.\n\n10. Make sure to be a pious practising religious person in your religion as well if you are a Muslim, Christian, Buddhist or anything else. It serves as a sort of repellent for The Creatures think of it as the equivalent of some skunk spray for you.\n\n11. Keep your children close as that is The Creature's favourite target.\n\n12. This should go without saying but please do not make enemies in the town as when you need safety from The Creatures it can come back to bite you.\n\n13. The Creatures mostly prey on people in worse mental conditions such as the stressed and depressed being able to smell these things from miles away. If you need a break or to be exempt from work just message us and take a test for us to confirm your mental state and we will give you what you need.\n\n14. Honesty is appreciated in this community as this whole idyllic place wasn't built on lies.\n\n15. No matter what the voices say do not go into the cave on the edge of the town. It is where The Creatures take their victims to feed to their leader trying to nurture It back to full strength to once again claim the town.\n\n16. Keep your doors and windows locked at all times be in when home or away. Things can sneak in if a door is left open.\n\n17. If you knew someone who has been taken by The Creatures you do not know them anymore. The Creatures use these new victims to lure more people to the cave. That's how I lost my kids and almost myself. Don't worry we provide a list of fresh victims to look out for daily. The bodies usually don't last over a week.\n\n18. In future rules some may directly go against what I have written in a previous rule. In that case, remember the one that came before is the correct one.\n\n19. The Creatures can imitate voices when they are in moonlight so no one can let you in on voice (begging, screaming) after 10 pm unfortunately so remember the code in rule 4a.\n\n19a. Similarly if anyone begs for you to let them in and doesn't do the knock stated in rule 4a do not let them in no matter who they sound like be it your little brother or your mother.\n\n20. Music is allowed at all times just not overly pop songs such as K-POP. They like that music. Don't know why but it attracts The Creatures to you.\n\n21. Preferably if you like alternate (e.g 21 pilots), Indie (e.g lovejoy), Rock (e.g Queen) or even stuff like Elton Jhon, Eminem or The Beetles is ok. This music is preferred as it hurts The Creature's ears for some reason.\n\n22. Alway keep something ready to play this kind of music e.g a Spotify playlist shortcut (premium is provided to every resident for this reason) in case you are in a bad situation.\n\n22a. We all have music to signal it as well such as mine which is Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen, Sarah's is I'm still standing by Elton Jhon and Marc's is Stressed out by 21 Pilots. The full list will be on the kitchen counter. Please try to it safe to know which house The Creatures are at or who to help.\n\n23. Please keep screaming to a minimum thus don't watch or read a lot of scary things at night. It draws attention to you and disturbs us all.\n\n24. We celebrate all holidays. We celebrate them in different parts of town e.g last year it was downtown for Christmas and Eid, uptown for Hanuka and other places for other holidays as well. Locations are given close to each holiday roughly a month before it.\n\n25. Don't be racist, sexist, homophobic etc. we like to include all people from all walks of life here :) Punishment for breaking this rule is being the night guard at the gates of the town for 7 nights in a row.\n\n26. At night you may sleep as they do not sense anyone if they aren't awake and thus you would be practically invisible to them.\"\n\nSeeing this I immediately dismissed it as someone trying to scare me, the new resident. Though it was nagging me. Maybe that is why the listing was so cheap. I decided to change my plans and get moved in first and then confront my neighbours about it, to see if they knew anything. It took me roughly an hour to get everything where I thought it should go even though it was only 15-20 small items I kept with me. By this time it was around 5 pm so I thought I better get a move on and ask some neighbours about the note.\n\nFirst I went to ask my neighbour Sarah, a woman with a kind face, and an even kinder personality as well as her husband Ahmed and her 2 kids. We would talk for a while, introducing ourselves and getting friendly. Eventually, I brought up the note that I found on the table and suddenly that soft and cheery face turned into one of pure seriousness. Those joyful eyes were now full of concern. She gritted her teeth saying \"Make sure not to ever break those rules\". After this, we returned to our conversation as I left a few minutes later. I talked to other neighbours but they all had the same reaction. I decided that maybe I could break one rule and peek out the window to see these creatures.\n\nI started by following these rules. I was home inside before 10 pm with the doors and windows locked and the curtains all drawn. I had my religious text close and a shortcut for some music on my phone that was approved by the town neighbours and leaders. I decided to choose Stan by Eminem as my song and it was added to all the sheets. Shortly after I decided to do something that I would forever regret. I decided to peek out of the window.\n\nThe street was dark, there were no lamps lit. It looked like one of those subliminal space images you see on the internet, a stark contrast from what it looked like in the day. Still, I could see what the creatures, in their true form, were. A creature of pure terror that even my nightmares could not concoct no matter how hard they try.\n\nThey have no hair at all. They were made of some sort of rubbery skin-like material only with lots of folds and ridges in them. Standing next to the trees they were tall enough to peek into the second-story windows but bend down to reach the door and windows. I saw them change size though not massively it was enough to allow them to become roughly 6'2. The teeth were all sharp a yellow tinge with red on the edges. They were vaguely humanoid, enough to pass off as a human if they were far enough away. Those red piercing eyes with nothing behind them. Hollow husks with only the ability to hunt for food. The limbs were contorting with cracking noises I could hear even from inside the slightly soundproof walls of the house.\n\nAs quickly as humanly possible I closed the curtains once again praying and hoping that they didn't see me. I could only imagine what they would do to me if they found me. That was when I heard knocking at the door. It was quiet at first but persistent. It would not stop going on and on over two. It started to sound like banging before the voices started. I heard my wife and children outside yelling and begging me to let them in. Blaming me for what would happen if I wasn't going to open the door for them. Tears rolled down my eyes as I slumped over the door still trying to keep as quiet as I possibly could because I knew they were dead and nothing would ever bring them back. They hadn't left me for someone else, they had died in a drunk driving incident leaving me alone. Sounds of doorbells ringing started along with it. It was all too much to bear. I knew they could smell the sadness and the stress I was facing at that moment but I didn't care. I couldn't handle it all anymore and passed out as I heard the sound described in the 9th rule.\n\nI was found in the morning alive with my shirt soaked in tears and snot from my crying the last night. Sarah had come over to check on me and when I didn't answer the door she feared the worst and got the town head to open the door. I was apparently very lucky to have passed out as they would have gotten me if I hadn't due to my emotional state. I was immediately put into therapy for this and was to stay at Sarah's house with her husband and kids for the next week until I got settled into the town as they would keep me company ensuring my safety and making sure I remembered the other rules that were soon to come for me as I was about to start my new job.",

        "text": "How, or When?\n\nStory written by Spencer Lanzarotta\n_____\n\nThere’s this question you’ve probably been asked at one point or another in your life. The question being, “Would you rather know how or when you are going to die?” You might take a moment to think and weigh your options, but the majority of people end up choosing how, due to the stress of constantly knowing the exact date and time of their demise. \n\nI was asked this question by a man in a coffee shop. I was seated comfortably at a table next to a window when he entered the store. He positioned his body towards me, he was wearing a trenchcoat and blue jeans, and had long hair that went down to his chest. He walked over and without asking, sat down across from me. \n\n“So…” the man spoke. I looked up from my cappuccino with a puzzled look. What does this guy want? I wondered.\n\n“Would you rather know when, or how, you are going to die?” He finished, looking dead into my eyes. \n\nI paused, and eventually answered “When.” since I’d rather not know any gruesome details. I work in a factory so the possibility of a workplace accident is very much existent. \n\n“Good answer. Most people choose how.” The man then left the store without saying another word. How strange, I thought. \n\nOnce I finished my beverage I left the store and took my newspaper I was reading with me. The sun was bothering me so I raised my arm to shield my eyes from the blinding light. That’s when I saw it, written on my left forearm, permanently tattooed onto my body, read\nMarch 15th, 2023, 3:50 PM. \n\nI was bewildered to say the least. How the hell did this get tattooed onto me? I swore on my life to my parents I’d never get tattoos. I pressed my fingers against the ink and it was completely dry, like it had been there for ages. I rolled up my sleeve and continued onwards, I had a train I needed to catch. \n\nLater that afternoon, I hopped on the train and sat at a seat. Just then I put two and two together and realized something dreadful. The question that the man asked me back in the coffee shop, whether I wanted to know how or when I was going to die. I choose when, and now I have the exact time I’m going to die printed onto my body. The worst part? That’s two days from today.\n\nThe rest of the train ride was spent with me panicking. I almost got off at the wrong destination because I was so paranoid. Surely this couldn’t be the case, surely I’m not going to die in two days, right? \n\nUpdate 1\n\nI just woke up, and I’m feeling more scared than ever. I don’t want to go to work tomorrow, I know I’m operating machines at 3:50 PM. I’ll do anything to avoid getting grinded into a mess of bloody chunks. I’m going to prevent this, no matter what it takes.\n\nI still have more than 24 hours until that time comes, so today I decided to take the day off and relax at home. I hugged my kids like it was the last time I’d ever do it, and I told my wife I loved her more than anybody has ever loved anybody. \n\nMy family doesn’t know what’s going on. I’m scared that if I show them the tattoo and tell them the mans question and how I answered “when” they won’t believe me, and they’ll think I’m just an old, delusional, crazy man. \n\nLater that night, I tucked my daughter and son into bed, and I kissed my wife goodnight as I crept into the blankets for the last time.\n\nWish me luck. I’m hoping that tomorrow I can avoid my own tragedy. \n\nUpdate 2\n\nMy boss just called and said I needed to come into work, he says I’ve taken enough sick days and that I need to be productive. He’s right, I have a long history of sick days. I now regret that deeply. I wish I could just take one more sick day and lock myself in my room to prevent death from taking me, but my wife is giving me the side eye and I don’t want to upset her, or my kids. I should have just told them about the tattoo, but it’s too late now. Goddamn it. \n\nI took the train, just like I do every day, and I spent the whole ride with images of my hand getting caught between gears and getting absolutely blended, images of terrible things no man should ever have to witness or experience. My stomach is in knots. I don’t want this to happen to me. I don’t believe in god but I’d pray for centuries to avoid this.\n\nI looked down at my tattoo, and then at my watch, I have five hours until my supposed death. What can I do to prevent this? I thought frantically. I’m desperate. I stepped off the train and continued down the sidewalk to my work facility. \n\nAs I walked amongst the crowd of dozens of busy city goers, I spotted the back of a man wearing a trenchcoat. The man was also wearing blue jeans, and had long hair that went down to his chest. I recognized that style. I know who that man was. I needed to catch up to him.\n\nI began to dash through the crowd, bumping shoulders with people as they yelled profanities at me. I eventually caught up to the man and I tapped him on the shoulder. He turned his head and it was him. I knew instantly it was the man I had met in the coffeeshop just two days ago.\n\n“Excuse me!” I exclaimed with astonishment.\n\n“Ah, you again. I’m assuming you have questions, yes?” He asked with confidence as we both walked down the sidewalk together in unison.\n\n“I choose the other option! I changed my mind! I want to know how!” I shouted, desperately trying to alter my fate in any way.\n\n“Check your other arm, buddy.” He said before disappearing into the mass of people walking down the busy sidewalk. \n\nI looked down and gasped at the new tattoo that had formed on my right forearm.\nIt read\nMurdered by Boss.",

        "text": "The journal I keep is small and unassuming. At 11.5 by 17.5 centimeters, it fancies itself to be a Moleskin – though those dreams were dashed early on by my budget – and its faux leather cover is cracked and creased, worn enough to let the cardboard peek out. The paper is thick enough to keep bleeding ink at bay, though; for my purposes, that is enough.\n\nI’m not a writer. Not a poet. Not really a romantic, either. What I am is a millennial with a moderate-to-severe case of disenchantment and a therapist, and so I keep the journal, quasi-religiously, because I’m supposed to, and because this is at least one thing I can get right.\n\nRight?\n\nI don’t mind keeping the journal, which I’ve been writing in for about three months now.  I can’t really say whether or not it’s helped me in any significant way, though it *has* made me realize how exceptionally unexceptional my own existence is. And it does provide some comfort, I should probably say, the act of looking over it. The journal is a record that, no matter how insignificant I may be, I was here. I existed. I may not have mattered much, but I *was* all the same.\n\n…\n\nIt’s Tuesday night. I’ve already had two glasses of the cheap red wine that is going to give me a headache, and it’s time to write. \n\nI settle into bed and reach – without looking – for my notebook. It’s exactly where it’s supposed to be, as it always is. A skinny ribbon flosses the pages, marking my spot. I tug on it, parting the pages. The ribbon breaks in my hand. I swear half-heartedly. *This is what I get for buying the cheap stuff.*\n\nHeaving a sigh at the inconvenience of it all, I thumb through the pages, seeking the one with my latest entry, the one from yesterday. Pages of monotony pass beneath the pads of my fingers, my graceless penmanship unchanged as it has been since 11th grade. \n\nExcept. \n\nI blink a few times, and peel back a few pages. \n\n*I thought I saw…*\n\nI find it. A passage, just a few lines, dated February 3rd, 8:24PM:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*“...she recommended I scale back on my drinking. Apparently, just 2 drinks a day, aka 14 a week, is considered alcoholism? Or maybe alcohol addiction?? I don’t remember. It doesn’t seem like very much, honestly… But it probably wouldn’t hurt to scale back. So I’m going to start with no drinking on Monday and Wednesday. Easy enough. Just kind of boring.”*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wrote that last week. I remember writing the words. \n\nThe handwriting, however, isn’t mine. \n\nI rub my eyes, but the handwriting doesn’t return to normal. It’s just ever so slightly off, like the letters are marginally too angular, if that makes sense? It’s similar to my unsophisticated scrawl, but just…pointier. Sharper than it should be, somehow.\n\nI groan, and then laugh. *I guess I am drinking a bit too much. Two glasses of Malbec and I’m not seeing straight? Guess I really am getting old…*\n\nStill chuckling, I scrawl my entry for the day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*“March 10th. 9:30PM*\n\n*Some drama at work. Logan got sacked (no one was surprised) and threw such a tantrum that security had to escort him out. Pretty* *~~unfortutuate~~* *unfortunate note to leave on, which is too bad. I always thought he was a pretty decent guy, but I guess you never know. Nothing much else of note, though I think I need to scale back on the red wine. Maybe it’s time to switch to white?”*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI retract my pen with a click. The entry was short, but that’s okay, according to my therapist. *It’s not how much you write,* she always says, *it’s just that you* do *write.*\n\nIf it’s good enough for her, it’s good enough for me. The notebook returns to its designated spot on my bedside table, and I give myself over to dreamless sleep.\n\n…\n\nThe next day passes as it always does. I go through the motions until the motions are done, and then it’s over, and then I’m home, and the evening passes too quickly and I do nothing and it’s time to go to bed but first to write.\n\nStill down a bookmark, I flip through the notebook, find my last entry.\n\nIt’s not mine.\n\nI mean it *is,* the words are at least, the March 10th excerpt that I penned yesterday, that’s mine, but the handwriting? No, it’s not mine. It’s *not mine.* \n\nFeeling colder than I should, I flick through the pages, find the offending February 3rd entry that caught my attention yesterday. That angular font, a clever bastardization of my own…. It matches what I wrote yesterday. Or what I didn’t write. It matches what’s on the March 10th page.  *How could this be?*\n\nI leaf through the journal. Every other page looks as it should, cast in my loopy, loping scrawl. The only outliers are February 3rd, and now, March 10th. \n\n*The fuck?*\n\nPenmanship evolves, I know this, but after decades? After decades of the same motions, committed to muscle memory, would it really just *change?* Sporadically? And without my knowledge at all?\n\nI feel unwell despite myself. There has to be a logical solution, obviously, but still. I don’t like change. I like change in myself even less.\n\n*Could it be the antidepressants Dr. Sylvin put me on?* \n\nThe idea seems promising, but no… I’ve been on those for six, seven months already. Maybe if it made things screwy in the beginning, I could understand. But surely not now, not after all this time? When she says I’m stable? \n\nShaking off the prickly feelings on my neck, I pull out my pen, and my phone. I scrawl the following:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*“March 11th. 9:10PM*\n\n*I’m not feeling very well tonight. This is going to have to be enough.”*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI concentrate on the letters, studying every arc and angle as I commit them to memory. And then I take a picture on my phone. \n\nIt takes forever, but I finally begin to drift off. My digital alarm clock flashing 11:23PM is the last thing I see before I slip into sleep.\n\n…\n\nI wake at 3:00AM, slick with cold sweat. \n\nFind the journal. The page. Pull out my phone, the photo app, the picture.\n\nThe handwriting doesn’t match.\n\n…\n\n*3:15 AM*\n\nI’m on my knees looking under my bed, iPhone flashlight illuminating the dustmotes, the lint. My closet. The cabinets. Behind the drapes. My front door is locked. I unlock it, lock it again. I squint out the windows, turn off the overhead lights so I can better see into the blackness. \n\nNothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. I don’t know what I’m looking for. Whatever it is, it isn’t there. At least not where I can see it. \n\n…\n\n5:17AM\n\nI’m too spooked to sleep, too jumpy to stay in the house. The gym opens at 5:30. I get in my car. I’m halfway there when a voice in my head reminds me that I didn’t check the trunk before leaving. But why would I have? My car was parked in my garage. \n\n*I never check the trunk, why would I check the trunk!?* I accost the voice in my head. My knuckles are white on the steering wheel.\n\n…\n\n5:32AM\n\nI don’t work out. I just stand in the shower, temperature as hot as I can stand, skin blazing red.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n7:05AM\n\nThere’s nothing in the trunk. I checked. I checked twice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n7:45AM\n\nWork.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5:14PM\n\nI take the long way home. I scan the outside of my house, looking for something, *anything.* It’s all exactly as I left it.\n\nInside, I pull the journal from the floor, where I had thrown it in the wee hours of the morning. \n\nHands shaking, I open it. \n\nLast night’s entry starts *“March 11th, 9:20PM,”* the handwriting as unfamiliar as it was at 3:00 AM this morning.\n\nI turn the page. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*“March 11th, 11:45PM…”*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI slam the book shut. \n\nNo. No. I was asleep before then. Wasn’t I? I was, I *was.* \n\nI find the page. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*“March 11th, 11:45PM*\n\n*I’m cold. I can’t sleep. I’m so tired. I want to sleep, I just… can’t.* Something *won’t let me. I just want to sleep...”*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe imposter handwriting I now recognize, but the words I do not. I didn’t write that. I was already asleep. Unless it was like sleep walking, but with writing? *Even if that were the case, if I were actually asleep, why would I write as though I wasn’t?* I turn back to the page.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*“...I’m not feeling very well. The cold is starting to wear on me. It’s happening more often. Too often….”* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBile stings my throat. *What the fuck* *does that mean?*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*“..I think I need to talk to Dr. Sylvin. She needs to know that I’m not alone anymore.”*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI dry heave, lurching over the notebook. Flecks of saliva spatter on the page as my stomach convulses. \n\nMy eyes dart to the adjacent page. It was blank just moments ago. It isn’t anymore. I look at the clock, the red lights throbbing 5:50PM. I force my eyes back to the new entry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*“March 12th. 5:50PM.*\n\n*I’m behind you.”*",

That thing had to die, and it was going to be me. \n\n   Since last time, I armed myself a little better, I drew out the little money I had and bought a better gun than the antique I had been using. \n\n  A blackened metal piece with wood furniture, a pump action shotgun. It and a box of shells ran me almost my entire savings. When the guy at the counter asked me what I was using it for, I froze.\n\n  Nervous thoughts racked my mind, flash backs of that beast, until I managed to force out the word hunting.\n\n  The ride to the farm was hell, visions and memories of that thing swam in my head. Every few feet I could have sworn I saw it moving in the corn, but it was just my imagination, I hoped. The sun was just setting, and it was deathly quiet as I stopped at the house.\n\n  I tried my best to prepare myself, climbing into the hayloft of the barn, which was now devoid of any animals. And I waited, tucking myself in one of the corners with a sightline towards the house. \n\n   Waiting was agony, cold sweat ran down my forehead as I hid, half wanting it to come, half wishing it was all a nightmare. But that nightmare came true when I saw something big, much too big to move that fast, cutting through the cornfield like a shark.\n  \n   I watched it raise up, white skin stretched over a thin, bony frame. It stalked forward, legs bent and creeping on all fours. It walked circles around my truck, like a bloodhound finding a scent. And when it did, it began moving towards the barn.\n\n  As it came closer, I prepared myself, rising up into a crouch. It practically dragged its eyeless, skull like head across the ground after me. When it reached the barn it let out a terrible hiss, whipping around searching for me, its prey.\n\n I crept to the edge and raised my gun, levelling it with the creature and squeezing the trigger. But as I fired, it jumped at me, the shot only clipping it. It slammed into the loft but didn’t make it, falling back down.\n\n I racked another shell in and ran to the edge, firing again and hitting it somewhere in its gut, it let out a scream and ran off, leaving a trail of gore behind it. Shaking and trying to calm myself, I loaded my gun and sat for a minute before climbing down and following the thing.\n\n  A flashlight in my teeth and a gun in my hands, I followed the trail of blood to the old house, and into the cellar. I threw the rusty double doors open off the ground, and descended. I walked over stripped bones of different sizes, from small to larger than mine. \n\n I could hear it breathing. \n\n   Labored and heavy, I saw it at the end, hunched over and bearing its teeth, it roared deafeningly with rotten meat on its breath. I screamed back, firing my gun as I did, emptying it shot after shot into the limp body of the creature.\n\n   It was only after calming myself and moving towards the body I could hear the crying, pitiful and shrill, it was coming from some kind of structure behind the now dead beast. In it, was a small white being, its head much too large to raise, its body thin with pale, near translucent skin. \n\n  Im writing this from the cellar, what do I do? Do I cover this up like my grandpa, or finish what I started and kill it?",

        "text": "I’m honestly not sure where to even begin with this. It’s been, well, almost a year to the day now, and I still can’t fully understand or comprehend what happened that day. Neither have I been able to fully get over it. I’ve floated from one psychologist and psychiatrist to another, all which tell me that what I experienced couldn’t possibly have occurred. And, yet, as much as they try to make my mind believe that, both with words and medication, as much as I try and make *my* mind believe it wasn’t real, I know deep inside myself that it was real. So, I’m choosing to post my account of this here, both as a, admittedly, rather pathetic attempt to release some of the guilt and horror that I’ve carried with me since that day. And more importantly, as a warning. To anyone who will listen.\n\nYou see, I used to love scuba diving. I became certified when I was sixteen years old, and I’ve dove both in freshwater and saltwater ever since. I’ve met and become friends with many great and talented people because of it, and Tyler was one of them. A daredevil at heart, and always up for an adventure, I took him under my wing, as he was less experienced than I was, and a few years younger than me. We eventually became close enough that we called each other brothers, and though we lived in different states, we always met up at least once a year to go on a scuba diving trip. That was, up until the pandemic hit a few years ago. When it hit, due to the quarantines and difficulty to travel it made, we wrote off our annual meet-ups for 2020 and 2021. We kept in touch, but it just didn’t feel the same. \n\nThen, one afternoon in April of 2022, I received a phone call from him. But, all the usual cheerfulness and bravado seemed to have been sucked out of his voice. He told me that his work had chosen to lay him off as a way to cut back spending costs due to the strain his business had been put under, and he’d been forced to go on food stamps and cash assistance as a result of it. To make matters worse, Veronica, his long term girlfriend of almost seven years, had decided at the same time to break off her relationship with. Let me tell you, that woman truly did complete him, and losing her, on top of the stress from losing his job and inability to find a new one quickly, had quite literally deflated. I felt helpless, unable to do anything to cheer him up, standing in my kitchen holding my phone, when an idea that I’d been floating around in my head sprang to the surface.\n\n“Hey, Ty?”, I asked, trying to fill my voice with as much excitement and mystery as I could, “I thought of something we could do that might make you feel better” “What?” he asked, his voice inflectionless and hollow, like that of a robot. “Well, I was thinking, I have a few days coming up in the next few days off from my remote work. What about just, packing up, having me come drive and get you, and we go take a scuba diving trip?” I heard a slight stir on the other end of the line, but his voice remained the same. “I mean, I guess so. But where could we go? So many places are off limits due to, well, I mean, have you taken a look at the news?” A slight smile crept across my face as I prepared to spring my idea on him. “The place I’m thinking of is one where there won’t be as many people right now, because of the season” My smile grew wider. “What’s one of the places you’ve wanted us to dive together the most, but we’ve never been able to?” A pause. “I mean, there’s plenty of places. Lake Superior, The Blue Hole, The Great Barrier Reef-“\n\nI cut him off. “No, I’m talking about someplace much closer to both of us.” I dropped my voice low. “I’m talking about Crater Lake” There was the longest pause of the call yet, and then he spoke, his voice now filled with something I’d been hoping for: curiosity, and a bit of excitement. “Crater Lake, man?”, he asked, “That is one place you and I have had on our bucket list for years” A hint of doubt crept into his voice. “But, I mean, how? You know as well as I do that scuba diving isn’t allowed there. If we get caught-“I cut him off again. “Don’t worry about that, bro. I’ve been doing some scouting of the area, and there aren’t many park rangers in the area as there would be in the summer or fall. If we go at certain time, we’ll have a few hour window to check out what we can, and grab some quality pics and video”\n\nAnother second of silence. Then, “Why the hell not? I’ve got nothing to lose, and this might help get my mind off the world of shit surrounding me. Let’s do it man!” A grin split my face as I heard the first hint of his old self creep back in. We spoke for a few minutes longer, fine tuning the details, and then we hung up to both get some sleep. As I walked to my bedroom, I glanced at a framed picture of the lake that hung on my wall. I couldn’t help but grin as my gaze lingered for a moment more, looking from the edges of the water to Wizard Island. I climbed into bed and drifted off into a sound sleep. That night was honestly the last decent night of sleep I ever got.\n\nThe next morning, I packed all the gear we’d need into the back of my battered Ford Probe, and then made the many hour long drive from Northern California to Salt Lake City. When he answered the door, he was clearly beyond excited. He almost seemed like a kid on Christmas morning, ready to open his presents. It was infectious; as we left back west, I couldn’t help but revel in the same feeling of excitement, and a bit of risk and danger we were about to undertake. After a few fill ups, combined with many snack and restroom breaks, we passed into Oregon, stopping a final time in Klamath Falls before entering Crater Lake National Park. We told the ranger at the entrance that we were merely heading in to do some snowshoeing around the lake, showing him the snowshoes we’d bought in town as a front. After a moment of taking down our names, he smiled. “Just be careful, boys”, he said, “We’ve had some recent snowfall, and some areas are tricky going!” We thanked him, then drove up into the parking lot, getting out and retrieving our packs and attempting to hide the obvious yellow glow of our scuba tanks under them.\n\nAfter a few minutes hike, we were rewarded with an amazing view of the place we’d come for. For those of you who have never seen Crater Lake, it used to be an active volcano called Mount Mazama. When the volcano collapsed about seven thousand years ago, it formed what is known as a caldera. The view is amazing; you can look from the top ridge and see the rim of the dormant volcano wrapping around, and the forested sides leading down to the water’s edge. On the west side of the lake lay Wizard Island, having pushed out of the water from a secondary eruption. You can also see Merriam Cone, a smaller spigot of land rising up.\n\nTyler and I shared a grin and a high five, before carefully making our way down to the shore of the lake. We looked around for a few minutes, catching a glimpse of some snowshoers disappearing into the tree line, before hiding our packs behind a rather large group of rocks and stripping off our clothes, revealing the dry suits we had on underneath them. Helping each other put on our tanks and vests, we made our final checks of our gear before pulling the hoods up over our heads to protect them from the cold water. I glanced at Ty as I picked up my flippers. “You ready for this, man?” I asked. He gave me a dopey grin; his trademark sign that he was beyond stoked. “Does a bear shit in the woods?” he asked, earning a shared laugh between both of us. I picked up both cameras and handed one to him. “Then let’s do this, while we still can!” I proclaimed, slipping on the flippers and turning to walk backwards into the water. \n\nEven with the dry suit on, the water temperature still sent a small shockwave through my body. As soon as the water reached my waist, I pushed off to get myself into deeper water. A moment later, Ty joined me. Staying close to each other, we dropped below the surface, marveling at the view around us. The water’s of Crater Lake are extremely clear and very blue, giving a large amount of visibility. It feels so surreal, to say the least. Flashing each other the okay sign, we pushed out towards the shoreline of Wizard Island, snapping photos and taking everything in. There had been a few other people to scuba dive here over the years, with the national park service approval, of course, but recreational diving was barred to, according to the reasoning that was given, not wanting to bring any invasive species of creatures into the lake, or mess up the ecosystem in any way.\n\nAs we followed the rocky bottom next to the island, I felt at peace; the only sound that could be heard was the streaming of bubbles each of us made as we breathed in and out. I checked my air gauge quickly, noting that we had about two hours of air remaining. *Plenty of time to enjoy everything*, I thought to myself. The thought was interrupted by a poke in my shoulder. I glanced, and saw Ty point out ahead of us. After a moment, I saw what he’d spotted. Swimming just ahead of us was a large school of Kokanee Salmon, one of the two species of fish that the lake had been stocked with. Their large, bright red bodies stood out clearly in the clear water, and it made for an amazing shot. I brought the camera up to my mask and snapped off a few photos, then noticed Ty motioning to me. He began heading out towards the salmon, and after a hesitant moment, I followed.\n\nAs I followed him, I spared a glance downward, and felt almost a sense of vertigo overtake me, even underwater. Not far off the shore of the island, the bottom simply drops away into nothingness. The bottom of the lake is over a thousand feet deep, making it the deepest lake in the United States, and one of the deepest in North America. It was so deep, that submersibles had traversed the lake bottom before. I stared down, feeling an almost unwilling sense of unease creep over me as I noted that, for all the water’s clarity, it was so deep that you couldn’t see the bottom. I shook my head. *Get a grip, Marcus. This is a landlocked lake, not the Pacific Ocean. There’s only salmon and trout in here with you, nothing that could attack you.*\n\nRefocusing, I noticed Ty had gotten a little too far ahead of me, and I kicked hard to catch up with him. He had drifted close to the school of salmon, and as I approached, I must have been making too much noise, because they quickly scattered into the distance. Ty shot me a bit of an annoyed glance over his shoulder, and I raised both my hands in the universal sign for *Sorry*. As I joined him, something caught my eye out in the distance. Something bobbing up and down in the water; a long, cylindrical shape. I tapped Ty on the shoulder, then pointed. After a moment of looking, he gave a cry of excitement, the sound muffled by the regulator in his mouth.\n\n*The Old Man of the Lake*. I had seen it countless times from the shore of the lake, and others from the tour boats which crisscross the lake in the summertime. It was a huge floating tree stump, almost thirty feet in length. The thing had become as famous as the lake itself, due to the fact that it had been floating around in the lake since at least 1896, when it had been first spotted by a man named Joseph Diller. For one reason or another, even after over a hundred plus years in the water, it had refused to sink, and floated freely from one side of the lake to the other. It also held a lot of superstitious significance, as in 1988, a submersible expedition tied up the stump on one side of the island, resulting in storm clouds to immediately move in. They disappeared when it was released, and thus, the legend of it being more than a dead tree began.\n\nAll this flashed through my mind as I watched it bob up and down in the water like a buoy, at least a mile away from our location, deep out near the center of the lake. I spared another glance at Ty, and could immediately tell what he was thinking by the look in his eyes. I knew it was one that I shared. He pointed towards it, and I held up a finger before again checking my air gauge. *Two hours left*. I held it up and pointed at him. He came beside me and showed that he had roughly the same amount of air in his tank. Nodding, I pointed towards the log and gave a thumbs up. Ty gave an underwater fist pump, and I couldn’t help but laugh at the absurdity of an underwater fist pump, letting in a small amount of lake water get into my mouth around my regulator. Shaking my head, I led the way out into open water.\n\nIt took us about ten to twelve minutes to reach it, but when we did, we couldn’t help but stop swimming, bobbing up and down vertically in the water as we marveled at how big it was close up. At the water line, the top of the stump rose about four feet out of the water, and was about two or three feet thick; down here, though, it was much thicker. I mentally calculated that it had to be about four or five feet thick in the middle. The entire underwater section of the stump was covered in a thick, green moss; it was also present much farther down in the lake, but this was the only place near the surface in which it resided. I raised my camera and snapped off a few photos, some looking head on at the massive shape, and others looking down as it fell away from us; at the few roots which sting clung to its bottom.\n\nTy patted my arm, and then motioned for me to go float next to the stump. He raised his camera, indicating he wanted a snapshot of me with it. I shrugged my shoulders, then fulfilled his request by kicking over a few times until I floated almost directly in front of it. As he prepared his camera for the shots, I felt an odd sensation begin to creep over me. I wouldn’t call it outright fear, but, it was almost uncomfortable. It felt like all the hair on my arms and legs had stood straight up underneath my dry suit. I glanced around, trying to figure out what had caused the instinctive reaction in me, but I saw nothing. I glanced at Ty and motioned for him to hurry up. He motioned for me to be patient and kept fumbling with his camera. The feeling amplified within me, now accompanied by a feeling of being watched. And not by something that you would want to have its eyes on you.\n\nI glanced around again, but aside from the stump, I saw nothing. That’s when I realized something odd. All the while before we’d been diving, we’d seen dozens of salmon and trout; hell, the salmon population in the lake alone is over sixty thousand. But now, I couldn’t see a single fish. A chill went up my spine. *Something’s not right here*. As much as I wanted to shrug it away as a paranoid thought, I knew better than to ignore my instincts. I waved at Ty, but he was too preoccupied with the camera to see me. I made a grunting sound around my regulator, but I still got no response.\n\nThat’s when I felt something slide against my leg. It was only for a moment, but it was the most unnatural feeling I’ve ever felt on or over my body. It felt. It felt like *bark*, but alive at the same time. I shot a glance down, but saw nothing near my body. As I looked, I felt the sensation again; this time on my shoulder. I spun quickly around, so fast that I left a small trail of bubbles behind me. There was still nothing there. Only the stump. *Okay, fuck this shit*, I thought, and began to kick back towards my friend. That was when I felt something wrap itself around my ankle. This time, however, it did not let go; in fact, it tightened, almost painfully so. I instinctively reached down to swat at whatever it was, hoping I’d frighten it off, but instead, I felt something thin and hard there, still refusing to let go of my leg. I shot a glance behind me, and couldn’t help but let out a muffled scream at what I saw. *What the fuck?!*\n\nThe object that was gripping my ankle looked like a fucking *tree root*. It was thick and black, and covered with green moss. That wasn’t what had caused me to scream, though. What had caused that was where it had come from. It came from the goddamn s*tump*. I could see where it had slid out from, under the very bottom of the log. And it was not alone. From the bottom and sides slid out many more of the root things, for all intents and purposes looking like the roots they appeared to be, but slithering through the water in snakelike fashion. And they were coming for *me*. I screamed again and kicked out as hard as I could, attempting to free myself, but unable to.\n\nA blur appeared beside me, and after a moment of confusion, I realized it was Ty. He’d seen and heard my struggling, and now floated beside me, his eyes wide and full of fear. Reaching down, he attempted to pry the root from my ankle, but to no success. The other root appendages had almost reached me now, and I involuntarily let out another muffled scream, almost in defiance at my fate. In that moment, I felt with certainty that I was going to die. Ty reached down and unsheathed the knife from his ankle, and with a fury I didn’t know he possessed, began slashing at the appendage that clutched me. Within a few cuts, the water began to cloud with a strange, green-ish fluid. I felt the grip on my ankle loosen and unwind, and I instinctively kicked forward to fully free myself from its clutches. After a few kicks, my mind caught up with me, and I realized something. Tyler wasn’t with me.\n\nI turned, and was met with a horrific sight, one which I still see when I close my eyes. The reason why the root had loosened itself from me, was to go after what was attacking it. Tyler. *Oh, my God*. It had caught him by the arm he had used to slash at it with, and was tightening its grip, far more than it had me. I heard the sickening crunch of his wrist breaking, a sharp sound that pounded through the water, along with his muffled scream. And worse? The other roots had reacted as well, and had reached him. One large one, as thick around as my thigh, wrapped around his chest and squeezed. Still more of varying sizes slid in and wrapped around his arms and legs. \n\nBreaking myself free from the horrifying sight, I kicked back towards him rapidly. When the root had broken his wrist, the knife had fallen from his hand, disappearing into the depths. But I had to do something. As I approached him, however, the stump seemed to move away from me, almost to keep me just out of reach of my friend. A particularly large root made its way out beyond all the rest, but unlike the ones which were gripping Ty’s body, this one lashed out like a squid’s tentacle. It struck me upside the head, and my vision blurred as I spun in a circle from the impact. For several seconds, I saw nothing but fuzzy shapes, and then my vision cleared. I saw a small red cloud begin to surround me, and reached up to feel a rather large gash near my hairline.\n\nTrying to keep myself conscious, I turned back towards the stump and Ty. And I wish to God, as much of a coward as that makes me, that I hadn’t. If you’ve ever seen John Carpenter’s *The Thing*, you’ll remember the scene where Copper attempts to defibrillate Norris, who turned out to be a Thing in disguise, and how his chest had opened up like a mouth. That was the sight that greeted me as I felt frozen in place. \n\nIt was *opening* up. The middle of the stump split apart, and opened like it was on hinges. Like it was a *mouth*. More roots slid out from inside the darkened space, and I heard my friend let out another muffled scream as his air tank was ripped off his back by a few of them. The regulator was torn from his mouth as the appendage tossed the tank out to the side, and more wrapped around his neck and head, effectively rendering him unable to move. I tried again to kick towards him, feeling my head spin with dizziness as I fought to keep from passing out. But I already saw it was too late.\n\nThe roots had a firm grip on him, and rapidly pulled him back towards the opening. I wanted to look away, but, I *couldn’t*. He still had his mask on, and behind the lenses, I could see his eyes wide with fear as he fought in vain to free himself. Then he was pulled inside, and I heard my friend scream one last time as the opening in the stump closed. I saw a quick flash from the camera still attached to his wrist, momentarily illuminating the hellish interior, and then, it sealed up. It floated farther away from me, and the roots- *the tendrils*, retracted back. In the span of thirty seconds, it again looked like nothing more than an ordinary tree stump.\n\nFeeling a wave of nausea pass over me, as well as a growing blackness envelop the edge of my vision, I could do nothing but kick for the surface. My head broke the water into the chilly afternoon air, and I spat the regulator from my mouth. I began kicking back towards the shore as hard as I could, all the while keeping my eyes locked on the four foot white shape bobbing up and down above the small waves until I reached shore, where I passed out.\n\nI awoke two days later in a hospital. A bandage covered my head where it had been gashed open, and it hurt like hell. I was greeted by the nurse, along with two policemen and the park ranger who had let us enter. After a few questions from the nurse about how I felt, I was left alone with the policemen and the ranger, who proceeded to bombard me with questions. I tried explaining what had happened to them, knowing full well that I would sound insane, and not caring. They *needed* to know what had happened. “You’ve got to believe me”, I shouted, “I swear I’m not making this up, the fucking thing is *alive*!” But, of course, they didn’t believe me. They chocked up my story to my head injury. They also decided that Tyler had drowned, having something faulty happen to his air supply. He barely even got a mention in the local paper, just another drowning victim. I was slapped with a huge fine and given a lifetime ban from the national park, with the penalty of jail time if I ever stepped foot in it again. *Like I ever would want to*. Veronica and Tyler’s parents blamed me for his death, and as much as the doctors I keep seeing tell me it wasn’t, I can’t help but feel consumed with guilt. After all, why shouldn’t I? I mean, I was the one who thought it up. He would still be alive if it wasn’t for my idea.\n\nNow, the one year anniversary of that horrifying day is fast approaching. I can’t help but think about anything but it as I sit on my couch night after night and try and drown my memories and guilt with bottles of whiskey and vodka. But not even the alcohol is enough to chase away the memories of that day. Of that *thing*, which pretends to be a stump. One which has floated around the lake for over a century. Every year, there are a few people who reportedly drown in Crater Lake. Often times, their bodies are never recovered, the lake being too deep to retrieve the remains. I’m pretty damn sure that the true reason swimmers disappear is much worse than that. Because when the camera flashed in Tyler’s hand before it closed around him, I saw something that still wakes me up in the middle of the night, screaming.\n\nAs it closed up, I saw the roots forcing their way into his *mouth*. Down his throat. I think about trees, and how their roots dig into the soil to slowly extract the nutrients from it. And I shake uncontrollably at the thought that that….*thing,* might have had a similar purpose for my friend.\n\nSo, I’m posting this as a warning. You can go visit Crater Lake National Park. It’s a beautiful place. You can even go walk around the edge of the lake, or take a tour on one of the boats. Both are perfectly safe. But, whatever you do, stay the hell *out* of Crater Lake.",

I watched nurses and doctors race in the same direction towards the front end of the building. The many ambulance sirens told me that something big was going down. I looked out my open window and saw the night sky lit up with orange flames in the distance. \n\n“In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity,” said a gruff voice from the shadows, “We both know that too well, but what many don’t understand is that there is the opportunity to act and there is the opportunity to ignore.” The man from the waiting room walked forward, using a metal rod to keep him standing up straight. \n\nI reached my hand under my pillow and gripped the axe handle. \n\nThe figure’s black mask looked down at me, predicting my next move. “I believe that right now, you should think before you choose to act.”\n\n“And I think that you should take off that mask. I already know who you are.”\n\nThe stitched grimace moved under his hood. Vigil used one hand to reach under the mask at the base of his neck and he pulled upwards. I saw this as my moment to pounce. I quickly grabbed the axe from under the pillow and swung it at the shape with all of my might. Vigil caught the axe with his free hand and tore it out of my grip. He finished taking off his mask and walked over to me, his large frame towering over me and casting a shadow across my already limited line of sight. His pair of white eyes seemed to shimmer in the night, giving me little to focus on as I adjusted to the darkness. Vigil placed the cold steel blade against my neck and pushed it into my throat, preventing me from swallowing the congealed mass of bloody saliva that gathered in my mouth while I slept.\n\n“If you truly knew who I was, you wouldn’t dare to strike me.” His icy breath caused goosebumps to appear on my nose. \n\n“What do you want from me? Nothing you do can take back what I did.”\n\n“And I don’t want you to.” He threw the heavy axe across the room with minimal effort. “I want you to know that both your ignorance and actions come with a price. Unfortunately for you, it’s come time for your actions and ignorance to be paid for and I suggest that you try to find your calm in the chaos.” Vigil slammed the blunt metal rod against the floor, cracking the tile underneath. His pale white face cracked into a smile. “Calming, isn’t it?”\n\nI flinched at the sound, thinking these might be my final moments. \n\nThere was more running in the hall. This time, only one set of feet. Vigil sunk back into the shadows and out of my vision. \n\n“What the hell was that noise?” The male nurse barged in holding a cane in his hands like a baseball bat. \n\n“The Vigil, he’s over there.” I made the mistake of pointing with my hand that should have been restrained. \n\n“And how did you get out of your cuff?” The male nurse walked over to me with the cane resting on his shoulder. \n\n“No, he’s right behind you!” I pleaded with him. “You gotta believe me!”\n\n“Just shut *up* already.” The nurse tapped his fingers on the cane and then checked the hallway to make sure no one was passing by. “Some people just don’t stop, do they?” He said under his breath. “You know, most of the other staff left to go to that fire at Blackport.” He took the cane and gripped it in both hands. “We’re on a skeleton crew at the moment.” He held the cane up high, ready to bring it down on my head. I held up my one good arm up in defense. ”Right now, it’s just *you* and *me*.”\n\n“And me.” A chain shot out of the darkness and wrapped around the cane. I watched Vigil use his foot to step on his end of the shackle and tear the cane away from the male nurse's hands. \n\n“What the f— oh,” the male nurse was caught off guard by Vigil holding out the fire axe for him to take. \n\n“As I see it, you have two choices. The second one isn’t so nice for you. Choice 1: You leave now and enjoy the remainder of your soon to be shortened life, or choice 2: You make it easy for both of us and we can finish this now. I’d prefer the first option.” \n\nThe man hesitated in grabbing the axe and let out an uncertain breath.\n\n“Then your choice is made.” Vigil let go of the axe and the man took it. “Swing first. I wouldn’t want to kill an innocent man.”\n\nThe male nurse carelessly swung the axe and Vigil parried and redirected the swing using the hook of his sickle. This spun the nurse back around to face me. Vigil used the blade and cut the back of his attacker’s left knee then he kicked out the nurse’s right knee with one of his muddy boots. The nurse fell to the ground and mouthed the words “help me” before I watched the end of the sickle pierce the back of his head and appear out of his mouth. Vigil tossed the weighted end of the chain over a pipe that ran across the ceiling and pulled down, causing the male nurse’s corpse to dangle in the air. \n\nVigil sighed. “Now… where were we?”\n\nI said nothing.\n\n“Ah, yes, you see, I gave him a choice. He chose unwisely.” He took a few steps forward and rested a hand on my bed frame. “My advice: Ignorance is bliss. Actions have consequences. Remember that.” Vigil folded his hands over one another and sat down on a chair that sat at my bedside. “It’s strange, I look at you and I see myself. I believe that we are only one step away from becoming equals. *I* clear the world of the evil, the deceitful, the twisted, and the belligerent. And *you* rid the world of the innocent, the honest, the courageous, and the considerate.” Vigil leaned forward. “Now tell me, why should you wear the halo?”\n\nI turned away from him. “How many people have you killed?” I paid no attention to his question.\n\nHe rested his hands on top of the metal rod. “Stopped counting. Between the ones that needed to go and the ones who were just in my way, I couldn’t tell you.” He raised his hood to conceal the top half of his snowy face. “That’s why I have people like you. You always kept count *for* me.” He cocked his head at me. “What’s it now? 8? 9?”\n\n“Eleven.”\n\nHe smiled lightly and closed his eyes. “A lot of work to do then. I stopped counting around the mid 30s and that was years ago. That’s why I took up the whole hooded figure and impractical weapon gimmick. Thought I’d give myself a bit of a challenge.” He took his mask out of his pocket and wiggled it in front of me. “Do you know how difficult it is to see out of this thing?”\n\n“I’m sure it’s awful,” I brushed past his complaints and tried to get any other information out of the man in my hospital room, ”Why kill him?” I pointed at the male nurse who was still dripping blood and grey matter onto the floor. “What did he do?”\n\nVigil stuffed his mask into his breast pocket. “He was in the way. Also deserved a punishment for what he did to you yesterday. I couldn’t just standby and watch someone get hurt.” Vigil laughed at his own sarcasm which quickly turned into a coughing fit. Once he caught his breath he continued. “You should be thankful that I didn’t let him beat you first.”\n\nI rolled my eyes. “He said it was just me and him. Is that true?”\n\n“Haven’t you looked outside?” He walked over to the window. “Can’t you see the flames? Can’t you hear the sirens?”\n\nI listened carefully and, ever so slightly, found the wail of ambulances in the distance. “What’s going on out there?”\n\n“Man arsons the local jail. Police call the fire department for backup, but without a chief, the coordination is gone. All 4 fire companies race to the prison and they call the hospital for medical assistance. The hospital receives calls from all 4 departments, so they send everything they got. Too bad their secretary is out on leave to make sure at least some of the staff stays… and in all of this chaos there was an opportunity that led me right back to you.”\n\n“You’re insane!”\n\n“And you’re in debt!” He pointed the metal rod in my face before slamming it on the floor. “I think you know what must happen.” He began to walk over me with the rod clasped in both hands. \n\n“Wait, wait, wait.” I held my hands over my chest. “You don’t have to do this to me.”\n\n“They say that an eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind.” Vigil lowered his hood to reveal his bleach white eyes. “I tell them, ‘then so be it.’”\n\nThe blunt end of the steel rod pierced my good shoulder. I felt muscles and bones and ligaments break and detach as I screamed in complete agony. My vision slowly started to darken when I heard the rod go through the bed and clank against the ground. \n\nVigil continued talking, but the ringing in my ears overpowered the soft speaking man. “Hey!” Vigil lightly slapped my face with the back of his hand. “Listen to me!” He grabbed my neck and held me forward. “You should only be so lucky I don’t make sure you perish. I am giving you a chance.”\n\n“Let me go!” I tried to kick him, but it did nothing.\n\nHe smiled, “As you wish.” He let go of my neck. I felt every bump as my body creeped down the iron rod. I bit into my cheek so hard that it started to bleed. I looked into Vigil’s eyes and caught a glimpse of my own bloodied expression. I tried not to let it get the better of me, but I struggled in doing so. The pain finally overtook me and I blacked out. \n\nI think it was only a few minutes later that the dark figure woke me up by cutting my cheek open with his knife. “Now that you've gotten yourself comfortable, let me explain the rules.” Vigil took his mask out of his breast pocket and stretched it over his face. “Three bombs hidden in this facility. One across the hallway, under the bed of a dying man with a steel rod in his shoulder. Another under your bed. The call staff button on each of your bed remotes is now attached to the other’s bomb.” He folded my fingers around a mangled call button with an antenna and a cell phone taped to the side. “Neither one of you pulls the trigger, both of you die. Both of you pull the trigger, a random man in the hospital will die. We will see the results at daybreak. Until then, I wish you luck.” \n\n“No. I won’t do it. I’m not going to play this stupid game.” I threw the remote onto the bed.\n\n“There is one final option.” He pulled out a tangle of wires attached to a car ignition. “If either of you refuse to play, break your remotes, or attempt to tamper with the experiment in any way—” Vigil undid the top two buttons on his utility coat to reveal another bundle of wires and blinking lights strapped to his chest. “We all go down together.”\n\n“You’re insane if you think either of us are going to press that button.”\n\n“For your sake, let’s hope that I am.” Vigil turned around and went over to my jacket that hung on the chair in the corner. He reached into its pockets and took my house keys, my ID, and a small pocket knife that I kept on me. The shape picked up the chair and placed it under my door knob, preventing anyone from coming in. He then looked at the bulletin board and ripped off the flyers that advertised for all of the at-home services the hospital provided. Vigil lifted the nurse’s corpse off of the hook and threw him down on the axe head, splitting his face open further. He grabbed his sickle and threw the weighted end of the chain over his shoulder. The shape hoisted himself onto the window sill and sat on the ledge. “Last word of advice: People are not as innocent as they seem.” Finally, he leaned back and fell out of sight. \n\nI sat there, pondering my options. Either finish the man who I had already injured, kill a random man in the building, or die myself. I looked over at my numbing shoulder which I had almost forgotten about and noticed the sheets becoming more and more bloodsoaked with every second that the metal rod ran through me. I attempted to lift my body up the shaft of it, but the broken nerves prevented me from moving any more than an inch or so. Several times, I tried this, but eventually I realized this was only making me more and more tired for little to no results. The blood loss was starting to make the world go dark, with the occasional light headed feeling here and there, until finally, it all came crashing down. \n\nBlack. \n\nSilence.\n\nNothing.\n\nBy the following morning, a decision was made. I was awoken by the destruction of a bomb somewhere else in the building, causing the distinctive smells of death and burning motor oil to fill the air around me. The small window near the top of the door was shattered, leading me to the conclusion that, somehow, I must have accidentally pressed that button in my sleep. Staff filled the hallway and attempted to clear the debris away from my door. Men shouted for me to try and get up and out of the room before the flames came to me. I was still pinned to the bed, not only by a steel rod, but by the realization that I had killed a man the night before.\n\n“Vigil,” I tried to say. My voice came out in a quiet whimper. “There’s a bomb in here.” They couldn’t hear me. The staff was too concerned with my door to care what I was saying. I looked over in the corner of the room, where the nurse’s broken skull lay on top of the fire axe. “Axe,” I could barely raise my voice above a whisper, with the rush of adrenaline being the only thing keeping me awake. “Need axe… door blocked.” \n\n“Shush!” The female nurse shouted at the group of men. “I think he’s saying something.”\n\n“He needs help!” Yelled one of the men, jiggling the doorknob. \n\n“Quiet.” I saw the top of her head appear in the broken window. \n\n“Axe.” I repeated. “Chop door.”\n\n“An axe!” She yelled at one of the men. “Get the emergency one. Down the hall and to the right.” \n\nI heard a man run down the hallway, crunching over broken glass and other debris that littered the destroyed corridor.\n\n“Are you okay, sir?”\n\n“Yeah, but hurry.” I lied to them. I knew I was dying, but I didn’t want them to botch things up due to panic.\n\n“It’s not there!” I heard the man yell from down the hall. “The box is empty.”\n\nI looked back across the room at the axe laying on the floor. Once again, he planned this all out. \n\n“Stretcher. Ram door.” I said to the woman outside. \n\n“Get me a stretcher! Anyone!” Nobody spoke up. “You two, go!” I heard two sets of footsteps run away again without question. Minutes later, I heard the squeaky wheels scratch down the hall. “Ready!… One! Two! Three!” \n\nThe wooden chair under the door knob splintered into many pieces and scattered across the floor tiles. The group of people rushed into my room and stopped at the scene before them. One guy puked upon entering. Another turned and walked the other direction with his hands covering his nose and mouth. The female nurse who had taken care of me earlier that week stood there astonished. The only words to escape her quivering lips were, “Oh dear God.”\n\nThe doctors took me to a new hospital room somewhere across the building and away from all of the impending commotion. They informed me that my right arm was likely going to be dead. A detective came in to take my statement about what happened the previous night. I told him everything and then some, although I still decided not to tell them about my involvement with the bus driver.\n\nAs of the time I’m writing this, I am a shell of my former self. Oftentimes, I find myself thinking about the man they call the Vigil. Even more times, I find myself thinking about the last thing he said to me. ‘People are not always as innocent as they may seem.’ It’s caused me to do some research on both of the other parties who “participated” in the experiment. The bus driver, Robert Grey, was a fifty six year old navy veteran, with the past crimes of eight counts of animal cruelty, twenty counts animal abuse, and eleven counts of dogfighting. He served six years in prison. The other man, Adrien Zannary, was a thirty one year old inmate taken out of prison due to a medical emergency. His past crimes were nine counts of sexual assault on a minor, and five counts of rape in the first degree. He is currently serving the rest of his life behind bars. \n\nToday, I received a letter from a man who was, by now, all too familiar to me. A nurse delivered it under the pretext that it was a get well soon card. I waited until she left and opened it up. It read:\n\n*Hello,*\n\n*I hope you are feeling better. Thanks for taking part in my little social experiment. The results were most interesting. If you have not figured it out yet, I lied to you. Your remote connected to the bomb under your bed and his remote connected to the bomb that went kaboom. He showed no mercy and it cost him his life. You did not want to cause any more suffering. I commend you for that.* \n\n*You see, you and I are not so different after all. You don’t want to cause more suffering, but don’t have the strength to end it. I want to end suffering, but the only way I know how is to cause more. I can see that each time we meet, you inch closer and closer to the edge of becoming just like me. At this point, all it’ll take for you to turn is one bad day. I believe you and I are doomed to do this for much longer than a few short nights. You won’t stop me, because deep down, you know what I’m doing is right, and I won’t kill you, not yet, because you’re just so damn fun to watch.* \n\n*I’ll see you around, Killer.*\n\n**Vigil**\n\nThere is still one thing left about that night that bothers me. I talked to the detective about my case after he had taken my statement. He told me that the remote system was reworked so that the wires connected to the bomb under our own beds, while the cell phone and antenna attached to it were just for presentation. I believe what scares me about this is the fact that before I passed out, I placed the remote on the table beside my bed. I panicked in the moment, but I know that if given the chance, I would’ve taken that man’s life. I believe that he knows this too. That’s not all. I know that you are still out there, Vigil, and I know that you are reading this. I don’t know what you are, what you want, or why you chose me, but I do know one thing: The next time that we come face to face, I won’t have to think twice about my actions.",

        "text": "Hi, It's me, Travis Marcella. If you are unaware of my story so far then go here: \n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11kc214/i_didnt_follow_my_fathers_rules_and_ive_uncovered/), [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11lavnl/i_didnt_follow_my_fathers_rules_and_now_something/), [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11mik5w/i_didnt_follow_my_fathers_rules_and_now_im/).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night was really uneventful, except for my overwhelming worry for Darius. I woke up to see that I had not realized that something had smashed my computer screen and prevented me from using it. I saw that my door was unlocked and I was worried that another breach had happened but as I stepped out of my cell, I was greeted by a burly man who seemed completely different from everyone else around here. He didn't follow whatever dress code everyone else followed.\n\n He wore a brightly colored shirt with flowers on it, as well as black shorts. He had blonde hair and had started growing a beard. His eyes were a light brown and he was around 6 feet tall. I looked around to see that there were guards around us. I stared at the man in confusion when he finally decided to speak up.\n\n\"Hello there, Travis. I am the facility director, Eddie Corville. I'm sure you have many questions but we must discuss the... recent \"events\" first\". He told me.\n\nHe led me through a bunch of hallways until i saw a door labelled \"Directors Office\". We went inside and he sat down at his desk with a large chair with red cushioning. I saw down across from him, In a chair of similar fashion but it resembled a stool more than a chair.\n\n\"So....What do you want\"? I asked cautiously.\n\n\"Well, first off. I'm impressed with how you were able to survive such an event, especially since the Cuspid was hunting you down-\".\n\n\"What's a Cuspid\"? I asked.\n\n\"Well, It means \"Tooth\".  That monster that breached its containment. It chased you down and almost killed you-\". I cut him off.\n\n\"No. It didn't \"Almost\" Kill me. I would have died if Darius wasn't there to save me. Your security sucks\". I said angrily.\n\n\"Who is...Darius\"? He asked with a quizzical expression.\n\n\"The bear thing! His name is Darius\"! I shouted.\n\n\"So it decided a name for itself? That is pretty humorous but we aren't here to talk about-\". I cut him off again.\n\n\"What happened to him\"!? I asked, seething with rage.\n\n\"He is currently being patched up. He will be back in containment soon\". He stated, clearly shocked at my outburst.\n\n\"You've been promoted to work as a Security Guard. You start today\". Eddie said.\n\n\"Don't I need training or something\"? I asked.\n\n\"Well, Between you and me... not many breaches happen here, excluding yesterday. You just need to look authentic and someone of authority and power. It's mostly guarding a door all day\". He finished.\n\nI was appalled at how this guy was even the director here. He acted as if we were housing puppies not dangerous monsters who would kill us all without a second thought. Well, not all of them but you know what I mean. \n\nI did do some quick training despite Eddie saying it was mostly looks. I learned how to load a rifle, hold a rifle and shoot it with the bare minimum training of less than an hour. I wore some military grade Armour and was sent to a door with a label on it saying \" Room 126\".\n\nI should probably explain this to you all, but basically... Rooms with 1-500 as a number are rooms with cryptids inside that are being contained. Rooms with names like \"(insert name/Job) Office\", are for people who work here. Then you have rooms labelled 500-1000 which are rooms that people live in. I just wanted to clear that up for anyone who wanted to know this. I put my hands in my pockets to realize that someone had given me a piece of paper with rules on it;\n\nRule 1) Don't mess with any wires labelled \"H,W,X\".\n\nRule 2) Do not test on unauthorized \"patients\".\n\nRule 3) Alert anyone nearby of a breach if one happens.\n\nRule 4) You are not allowed to interact with \"patients\" unless authorized.\n\nRule 5) Do not break the Dress Code.\n\nRule 6) If anyone is caught breaking the rules, Alert the director.\n\nRule 7) Guards must always have a weapon on hand as well as body armour.\n\nRule 8) You are not to take any pictures or videos of anything here nor are you allowed to tell anyone where the facility is or leak any information to the public.\n\nRule 9)  Alert a guard of any suspicious activity going on nearby.\n\nRule 10) Terminate any trespassers if you are able to, if not, tell someone who is able to.\n\nThe rules were confusing and hard to simplify for you all to understand easily but I did my best. I'm pretty sure I have already broken rule 8 and rule 4 but as long as nobody knows about me breaking rule 8, I think i'm in the clear since I already talked to the director about Darius. I'm pretty sure \"Patient\" is referring to Cryptids. It makes me sick that people are trying to sugarcoat this.\n\nI guarded the door for about 6 hours since it was already noon when I was sent off to work. It was really boring and nothing happened. It's a good thing because I don't have to deal with the stress but I think i'll go stir crazy if I can't find a way to entertain myself.\n\nI was able to talk to some of the guards; Bryson,Rylie,Chris were the only ones that actually talked to me when I tried starting a conversation but it went...really badly. I said hi to Rylie and she immediately looked at me as if I insulted her somehow. She told me to go away and I obliged, Not wanting to annoy her. \n\n I then tried talking to some guy called Chris, He took one look at me and started insulting me faster than I could process what was even happening. He was pretty old and barraged me with stuff like \"Oh, I see the facility is now hiring moody teenagers huh?\" and \"You don't know what it means to be here, Kid\". I wanted to give that guy a piece of my mind but I decided it would be better to escape the situation. I immediately ran away from him to reach my cell when I bumped into Bryson. He looked a bit confused and then started talking to me.\n\n\"Are you the new guy\"? He asked.\n\n\"Y-Yea, uh, sorry for bumping into you\". I said, bracing myself for him to start getting mad or insult me but surprisingly he looked to also be in a rush.\n\n\"It's fine, I gotta get going though. Wanna talk again tomorrow?\" He asked in a cherry tone.\n\n\"Uh, yeah, sure\". I responded, relieved.\n\nWe parted ways and I made my way to my cell... I guess I should start calling it my room since I'm not restricted to it anymore. I tried to go to sleep but I wanted to see if Darius was ok.\n\nI left my room and went to find the room that Darius was supposed to be in. I entered a room to find a bunch of floating orbs. I immediately couldn't take my eyes off of them. They looked so majestic that I couldn't take my eyes off of them. I started hearing whispers as I walked closer to them, telling me to let them free and I would see my father again. I knew this was wrong but I still tried. I went to a control panel and went to let them out when I broke eye contact and immediately jumped back and closed my eyes. They kept whispering but it seemed more evil now, Telling me to open my eyes for just a second and see how beautiful they were. I was able to get out of the room and Immediately collapsed from the sheer mental power it took to not gaze upon them again.\n\nI continued walking through the corridors until I saw a familiar door number. I went inside and immediately rushed out when I saw what was inside. It was the Cuspid that breached containment to attack me. It didn't see me and I was able to leave without any problem. \n\nI was about to give up when I saw another familiar door and walked inside. The room was empty but I saw the claw marks and cracks in the floor. I looked at the door frame to see small cracks in the wall. The maintenance workers didn't clean up the room yet but I guess it was enough that everything else looked normal. \n\nI walked back to the area where my room was to see night guards stationed nearby. I was able to sneak back into my room unnoticed but I need to be more careful. \n\nThe following days were more or less the same. I was stationed at a door all day but was not able to check on Darius's room. There were guards stationed at my door, probably because someone saw me on the security footage as I was given a note telling me to not sneak out again. \n\nTomorrow I'm hoping to go to the medical bay to check on Darius. Bryson told me where it was so I have high hopes of seeing my friend. Sorry I didn't post sooner, I am usually exhausted when I finally get into my room after guarding a door all day and I recently had enough energy to post.\n\nI'll keep in touch and update you all when I can...",

        "text": "This happened in North Eastern Oklahoma within the cherokee reservation around 2008 in the beginning of fall. Myself and 8 other of my friends I went to school with had all met up at a friend's house to hang out for the night around a campfire and listen to music ect we are all about 15/16 years old. My friend had a trail that went maybe over a quarter of a mile into the woods where it led to a opened circle in the wooded area. There was a fire pit there with a single tree and another trail that led south from the opening where we would be hanging out for the night. \n\nWe sat aound doing this and that bull shitting into the night and may I remind you we are not partying. No booze no smoke no nothing just 9 of us out in the woods having a good time. It gets around 230 or 3 and things changed. We are all up having a good time and my friend Tjohn gets up and heads to the entrance of that south trail at the edge of the cut out to take a piss. I just happen to look up from the fire and turn to look at  and up from him in the trail this gray figuer stood in front of him about 20 yards away. I asked him quietly if he saw it and he looks up and comes back to the fire with the rest of us. My eyes are lock on this figuer standing in the dark.\n\nThis thing standing about 7ft tall gray with a static cloudy look to it. It's legs started about where the bottom of one's chest plate would be, long lanky arms which lay down almost to where it's knees would be with black hollow eyes with no mouth or nose. All 9 of us are staring at this thing and noone can move. Some started to cry some kept there heads down but I kept my eyes right on it. Looking at this thing while it stood there looking right back at us. It moved horizontally to the right into the woods off the south trail slowly moving around. It got to a part in the woods that during the day you could see was about a 7ft rock wall. When it approached that it hovered over this wall with no struggle at all and then it slowly back off into the depths of the dark woods and faded away. We didn't leave that fire until the sun came up and we got out of there as fast as we could.  \n\nWe didn't talk about that night for years after that. We kept it to ourselves and I only telling it to people who was close to me. 15+ years later I had asked some of the people who was there if they remembered what happened and what we witnessed and everyone of them remember exactly what it looked like and exactly what it did. 9 of us saw something in those woods that night and it saw us as well. \n\nThat's my story of a real encounter of something I can not explain other then seeing it with my own eyes and having 8 other people with me who saw the same thing. Who knows what it was?\n\nIv put this story on other subs but this one seemed to to have similar accounts. Thank you.",

Myself and 8 other of my friends I went to school with had all met up at a friend's house to hang out for the night around a campfire and listen to music ect we are all about 15/16 years old. My friend had a trail that went maybe over a quarter of a mile into the woods where it led to a opened circle in the wooded area. There was a fire pit there with a single tree and another trail that led south from the opening where we would be hanging out for the night. \n\nWe sat aound doing this and that bull shitting into the night and may I remind you we are not partying. No booze no smoke no nothing just 9 of us out in the woods having a good time. It gets around 230 or 3 and things changed. We are all up having a good time and my friend Tjohn gets up and heads to the entrance of that south trail at the edge of the cut out to take a piss. I just happen to look up from the fire and turn to look at  and up from him in the trail this gray figuer stood in front of him about 20 yards away. I asked him quietly if he saw it and he looks up and comes back to the fire with the rest of us. My eyes are lock on this figuer standing in the dark.\n\nThis thing standing about 7ft tall gray with a static cloudy look to it. It's legs started about where the bottom of one's chest plate would be, long lanky arms which lay down almost to where it's knees would be with black hollow eyes with no mouth or nose. All 9 of us are staring at this thing and noone can move. Some started to cry some kept there heads down but I kept my eyes right on it. Looking at this thing while it stood there looking right back at us. It moved horizontally to the right into the woods off the south trail slowly moving around. It got to a part in the woods that during the day you could see was about a 7ft rock wall. When it approached that it hovered over this wall with no struggle at all and then it slowly back off into the depths of the dark woods and faded away. We didn't leave that fire until the sun came up and we got out of there as fast as we could.  \n\nWe didn't talk about that night for years after that. We kept it to ourselves and I only telling it to people who was close to me. 15+ years later I had asked some of the people who was there if they remembered what happened and what we witnessed and everyone of them remember exactly what it looked like and exactly what it did. 9 of us saw something in those woods that night and it saw us as well. \n\nThat's my story of a real encounter of something I can not explain other then seeing it with my own eyes and having 8 other people with me who saw the same thing. Who knows what it was?\n\nIv put this story on other subs and just wanted to share with you lovely people.",

        "text": "My 6-year-old son wandered off into the woods behind our house.\n\nI  thought he was in his room, playing with Legos. But when I checked on him twenty minutes later, he was gone.\n\nAfter tearing apart the house looking for him, I noticed the back door was unlocked. *No. He ran out and… someone took him.*\n\nI went catatonic. I called the police, my husband came home, and an all-out search began. When we looked at our security cam footage, it showed little Parker simply walking across the backyard… and wandering into the forest.\n\n\"Okay,\" I breathed. \"So he's just lost. As long as we find him soon, everything will be okay.\"\n\nAnd it was the happiest moment of my life when, three hours later–right after dusk–one of our neighbors in the search party found him.\n\n\"Parker,\" I sobbed as I held him. So happy that he’d come home safe.\n\nBut that evening, my happiness started to fade.\n\nYou see, my son Parker is neurodivergent. He’s high-functioning, but he still has a lot of quirks that aren’t normal for a kid his age. He’s obsessed with birds—he can identify everything from the northern mockingbird to the downy woodpecker, and would rather do that than hang out with other kids any day. Food textures bother him to no end, especially dairy, and even just watching me drink a cup of milk or eat yogurt makes him retch in disgust. He throws a fit if anything gets wet—even a drop of water on the tablecloth will send him spiraling.\n\nSo imagine my surprise when I spilled a glass of water at the dinner table—and Parker didn’t react at all.\n\nNormally he’d be grabbing the tablecloth and running over to the dryer, screaming at me to get it dry. But instead he just sat there, oddly still, eating his chicken nuggets.\n\n*I guess he’s just too wiped out to care.*\n\nBut as I mopped up the water, I couldn’t shake that horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nLater that evening, I sat next to Parker’s racecar bed, perusing the bookshelf for a book. It was a hard choice—a favorite, like *There’s a Wocket in Your Pocket?* Or should I make him up one of my silly tales about Iris the Ibis?\n\nI felt like this night wasn’t real. Like I was dreaming that Parker was here, safely tucked into bed, and that soon I was going to wake up to him being still missing, still gone. I swallowed that thought and focused on my beautiful boy’s face, fighting back the tears welling in my eyes.\n\n“Do you want Dr. Seuss, or a story about Iris?” I asked him.\n\nHe tilted his head. “Dr. Seuss,” he said after a second.\n\n“Okay.” I opened the book and began to read. He didn’t notice the tears rolling down my cheeks.\n\nSoon it was over and I was turning out the lights. But as I turned on my heel, he called after me. “Can I have milk?”\n\nI stopped in the doorway.\n\nParker hated milk. Another one of his ‘quirks.’ Even watching me drink it made him retch in disgust.\n\n“Uh… sure,” I said, my heart pounding in my ears.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nSomething woke me in the middle of the night.\n\n3:26 AM, read the time on my phone. *Still 3 hours before I have to be up.* I sighed, pulled the covers around me, and rolled over—\n\nI froze.\n\nThe door was open.\n\nAnd there, peeking around the corner—\n\nWas Parker.\n\nHe was just standing there. Watching me sleep. Watching *us* sleep. And maybe it was my imagination… but in the darkness, it looked like he was smiling.\n\n“Parker?”\n\nHe dipped out of view and began to run down the hallway. “Parker—wait!” I called out, jumping out of bed. “Parker!”\n\nI ran out of the room just in time to see him disappear into his bedroom. But I couldn’t breathe. Couldn’t move.\n\nBecause he’d been running down the hallway…\n\nOn all fours.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI woke up before Parker did. Unable to shake the jittery feeling in my stomach, I busied myself by mixing up some from-scratch pancake batter and dusting off our waffle maker. *Parker’s safe. This calls for a special breakfast,* I told myself.\n\nThen why did I feel like something was so horribly wrong?\n\nI poured the thick batter into the waffle maker. It sizzled on contact. As I closed the lid, though, my phone began to ring.\n\nFRANKLIN POLICE, read the caller ID. *Huh.* “Hello?”\n\n“Mrs. Zimmerman?” a deep voice asked.\n\n“Yeah?”\n\n“This is the Franklin Police Department,” the voice replied. “And I’m thrilled to tell you: we found your son.”\n\nEvery muscle in my body froze. “… What?”\n\n“Someone apparently found him in the development on the other side of the woods, only an hour after he went missing. They’ve been trying to get in contact with us, but we only just got a hold of them now. He’s here at the police station. Would you like to talk to him?”\n\nI opened my mouth, but no sound came out. The phone was slippery in my sweat-covered hands. “I—I don’t understand,” I said finally. “We… a neighbor… found Parker… last night. But—but you’re saying… Parker’s with you at the station?”\n\nBefore he could reply, I heard a soft footstep behind me.\n\nI whipped around to find Parker was standing in the doorway of the kitchen, his ice-blue eyes fixed on me.\n\n“Mommy,” he said softly, “who’s on the [phone?”](http://www.reddit.com/r/blairdaniels)",

        "text": "The odds of getting struck by lightning in any given year are about one in a million, but for an average lifetime that’s just one in 15,300. Now, you’d think that if lighting *did* strike you, it would mean instant death, or at least imminent vegetation as your brains melt into scrambled eggs. In reality, around 90% of all victims survive.\n\nNow, that’s not to say that you can just walk off scot-free. Immediate symptoms of lightning strikes include, but are not limited to: \n\n* Heart asystole (basically a really, *really* bad heart attack)\n* Respiratory arrest (not breathing in enough oxygen to sustain bodily functions)\n* Burns (up to the third degree)\n* Broken bones\n* Hearing loss\n* Seizures\n\nWhen I woke up at the hospital, they told me I’d had prolonged respiratory arrest along with second degree burns. They said I was lucky, all things considered; I had been deprived of oxygen for quite some time, nearing cardiac arrest and organ failure. In short, I was brought back from the brink of death. Obviously, I was relieved, although confused, for at the time I could not recall *what* it was that almost killed me.\n\nOften, your physical body can bounce back somewhat quickly following a lightning strike. On the flip side, the most common long-term effects are neurological in nature, which include but are not limited to:\n\n* Sensory loss\n* Difficulty concentrating\n* Bouts of depression and/or anxiety\n* Shifts in mood\n* Changes in personality\n* Memory loss\n\nThe last thing I remembered was me getting a glass of water from the kitchen. There was a mild storm coming through the area, and I had been sitting in my lazy chair reading a book, when thirst had struck my dry throat. As I went to fill up my glass, something had pulled my body up and slung it across the kitchen. \n\nOf all lightning strikes, 32% happen indoors, which is not the same as storm clouds invading your home and attacking you like they’re minions of Zeus - and no, it’s not ball lightning either. Being in contact with landline telephones as well as poor plumbing are the most common causes. I live in an old house devoid of PVC piping, so their best guess was that lightning had struck somewhere near, or directly on my house, the electrical energy transferring to the metal piping, which connects to the tap. Unassumingly I had, at that exact moment, decided to pour myself a glass of water.\n\nI spent a week at the hospital. Each day the nurse would have to remind me of what had happened. I could remember my name, the date, the name of the president and all that, but the actual event slipped my mind each time. They did an EKG on me every day to check on my heart, which showed no signs of arrhythmia or other abnormalities.\n\nBy the end of the week I was finally feeling like myself again. My memory had improved, and I could remember exactly what had happened without it slipping my mind. My heart and other organs were doing fine, and the burns were healing well. I was told that there’s a chance I might feel depressed or anxious, especially in the upcoming weeks, and to call them if such symptoms persisted for more than a few days. They sent me home, and told me to schedule a follow-up in a couple of weeks.\n\nWhen I drove up the gravel driveway to my house, I saw my neighbor Ginny burst out from her front door and run up to my car. As I swung the door shut behind me, she jumped up and embraced me in a tight hug that would’ve pushed me onto the ground if not for the car catching us both. For a while she didn’t say anything, but then in a snap she let go, seeming slightly embarrassed at the forceful hug and the overstep in physical intimacy.\n\nGinny had been my neighbor for most of my adult life. I wouldn’t call us friends, but for two people living next to each other, we were quite close. We’d chat for a while anytime we bumped into each other, helped out with yard work, and kept an eye out for each other's property if one of us went on vacation. I’d never asked how old she was, assuming by her looks and similar life experiences that she was around my age: mid-thirties. She’d inherited the property from her mom, and had moved in a year before I had, almost a decade ago.\n\nGinny took a step back and looked me up and down, her gaze lingering on the bandages on my arms covering the burns. “Jesus, Nick, I thought you died. I tried calling the hospital but they wouldn’t say anything since I’m not family. You’d think they’d at least give some update to whoever called them in the first place, for fuck’s sake.”\n\n“They didn’t tell me you were the one who called 911,” I replied. “Thanks, Ginny. I mean if it wasn’t for that -- for *you*, I probably would have been dead.”\n\n“Glad you’re not,” she said, her mouth strict and taut in concern, her eyes wide in relief.\n\nI gave her a wide smile. “Me too.”\n\nGinny asked me about the burns, the hospital food, the EKG - everything. It felt good to unload, and she was happy to listen. At that moment, I realized how much she cared for my well being, and similarly how much of myself I wanted to share with her. I guess all it required was a near-death experience for us to realize these things.\n\nAs our conversation started to drift off, the pauses becoming longer and the turns to speak shorter, I was about to ask her to join me for a cup of coffee. She interrupted the small silence that had brewed just as I was about to open my mouth.\n\n“You should go and get some rest, Nick. And let’s talk more soon, okay?” And if you need a ride for your checkup, I’m glad to drive.”\n\n“Yeah, yeah… of course,” I muttered as I redacted the invitation in my mind. “And you get some rest too, I wouldn’t want you worrying any more about me. And maybe I’ll take you up on that offer.”\n\nGinny flashed a wide smile and looked into my eyes. “Good night.”\n\n“Good night, Ginny, and really…” I paused for a moment, forgetting how the sentence was supposed to continue as butterflies started to fly and flicker in my stomach. “Thanks again. For listening. And talking. And see you soon.”\n\nShe turned around and started walking back to her house. I stood there for a second and followed her with my eyes, feeling like for the first time I’d really *seen* her, presently mesmerized by what I had unearthed. She glanced back at me with a smile, and I nearly jumped from embarrassment, blushing like I’d somehow been found out. I speed walked the rest of the way up to my house, realizing something crucial: *she had glanced back.*\n\nOne side-effect of lightning strikes they didn’t care to mention was the half-empty fridge and the mound of expired food that awaited my arrival. I didn’t have anything to eat, and after a week of hospital food I *really* wanted some real food. So after a round trip at my house, I headed back out to get some groceries, feeling like I should’ve realized this would happen earlier.\n\nResuming my regular life was depressing. Not because my life sucked, but because, *apparently*  even if I get hit by goddamn lightning the chores and bills piled up as if nothing had happened. The monotony and bureaucracy of ordinary life would probably hunt me to my grave, the bills for the funeral service sent with me six feet under. Even Charon collected a toll to cross the river Styx for the *privilege* of getting into Hades.\n\nRoutine helped. Monotony by definition is constant, so that helps the brain do the thing that the brain does. After a week I was back in full swing, the accident transforming from a living instance to a memory. What bothered me most, though, is that every day as I pulled up to my driveway, I was hoping that Ginny would once more run up to me in that warm embrace she’d given me a week ago. I didn’t wish to get struck by lightning again, but I did wish that me and Ginny could pretend I had, so we could talk more.\n\nOne warm evening as I was doing groceries, I saw something… weird. There was a large, middle-aged man pushing a cart past me, his body pressing up against me without his knowledge. I glanced at him as he moved past, following him with my eyes in slight annoyance. As he turned the isle, it looked like his shadow had lingered. Like somehow the light lagged, glitched, or distorted in some way that made it seem like him and his shadow separated. I shrugged it off and continued with my shopping.\n\nAs I previously stated, neurological conditions are the number one after-effect of lightning strikes. Soon, I started to worry that there was some short-circuit of the brain happening, since after the man at the store I’d started to notice more and more disembodied shadows. I’d see people walking, and their shadow would simply stop following them, like a lazy dog on a walk it didn’t want to continue. Sometimes I’d see people without shadows at all, and vice versa; shadows in the mangled shapes of people that didn’t seem to have a beginning point.\n\nThe checkup wasn’t due for another two weeks, so I thought I’d just ride out whatever this was. Some slight problem with my eyesight didn’t seem too far fetched with all the other malfunctions my body had gone through as a gigajoule of energy pulsated through my organs and boiled my blood. Whatever this was, I reckoned there was a good chance it’d go away on its own. I tried not to look at the shadows, hoping they’d resolve themselves back to their originators in the meantime. \n\nSoon after, I stumbled upon a stroke of luck: I bumped into Ginny. We took out our trash at the same time (or maybe I waited until I heard her go out and then ran after her, *oh what a coincidence*) and had a conversation near the bins. Romantic, I know. We didn’t talk about anything too deep, the warmth of last week seemingly worn off. But to my surprise, she asked me out for coffee the next day. Thrilled, but trying to seem calm, I replied with an abnormally loud “yES,” like I’d just re-entered puberty and my voice had started to crack.\n\nCoffee went great. At the beginning we were both awkward, but soon the conversation just started rolling. We’d known each other for so long, yet we’d never talked for this long at a time; it was a weird concoction of familiarity and the unknown, like a painting that has been on your wall for what seemed like eternity that you didn’t know the artist of, or the year that it was produced. \n\nI learned more about her family, and how her mom got the house. How her dad lived a couple states away, so they don’t see each other very often. How, when she was little, she tried to mimic adults by pouring a dollop of coffee into her chocolate milk and calling it a latte. In the end, we’d talked for hours and probably had eight cups of coffee amongst us. Neither of us wanted to leave, but Ginny reminded me that a) we both have regular adult things to do, b) the coffee shop was about to close, and more importantly c) we can continue this on our *next date*. I guess lightning can strike twice.\n\nI walked Ginny to her car. It was early evening, the sun setting lazily and the parking lot lights providing us with a dim spotlight. We said our goodnights, and as if she’d anticipated my wish, she gave me a warm, big hug. This time she didn’t grip me like she didn’t want to say goodbye, like she had when I came back from the hospital, instead holding me like she would someone she’d be hugging again very soon.\n\nAs she entered her car and started to drive off, I noticed something *wrong*. Her shadow hadn’t followed her to the car, instead standing in the middle of the parking space. It was clearly *her* shadow, the spotlights drawing her distinct figure and long, flowy hair in inky dark lines. Now, this might sound ridiculous, but I tried to *shoo* the shadow away, like it was a stray dog. A bit less ridiculous sounding: the shadow didn’t heed my command. Instead, it stood there, wavering between rays of evening sun spilling over the horizon. It felt like the shadow *stared* at me, like we were partaking in a silent conversation.\n\nAdhering to my previous commitment, I tried to ignore the shadow and started to walk towards my car. I got in and sat there for a moment, the coffee and Ginny still warm and sweet inside my heart, but her disembodied shadow a pinprick in the otherwise excellent evening. I took a few deep breaths and put the key into the ignition, ready to hit the road.\n\nThen I heard it.\n\nA crash coming from the main road, loud enough to pierce all thoughts in two in a thunderous demand for attention. Obliging to its request, I exited the vehicle and moved toward the road.\n\nWhat unveiled itself was a waking nightmare I wouldn’t wish on anyone.\n\nA truck had t-boned a car as it pulled out of the parking lot and into the road. The truck’s speed must have been enormous, or maybe it was just a small thing getting outweighed and beaten by the bigger thing, speed unaccounted for.\n\nAs I saw the car, realizing it was Ginny’s off-white Toyota, I started to run, hoping to help, get Ginny out, call an ambulance, *something.* As I got closer I realized there was nothing I could do, my feet slowing down in anticipation of pure hopelessness. The truck driver had already jumped out of his vehicle and was looking at the wreckage stuck to the nose of his truck. The driver and his 18 wheeled hearse seemed to not have a scratch on either of them. Ginny wasn’t as lucky.\n\nGinny’s car was the shape of a fortune cookie, twisted and cracked in the middle, its ends pointed like the tips of a boomerang. Inside, her head laid on the forward-facing air bag, which, in the sideways collision had only helped to prop up her mangled body. Twisted metal strings and pipes had punctured her torso, coloring her blouse a crimson red. Her eyes were open, looking at the truck as if she was still waiting for it to pass before merging onto the road. Her legs were crushed and consumed by the vehicle, coalescing with the steel and oil and faux leather upholstery.\n\nThe last neurons in her brain fought valiantly until they too abandoned their post as she was being taken to the hospital. They told me she’d been in a vegetative state the instant she was hit, but her lungs worked for some fifteen minutes longer until she finally drowned in her own blood.\n\nFor the next few days, grief and guilt burrowed themselves deep into my soul. \n\n*I should have refused the coffee date.*\n\n*I should have kept her there for longer, then the accident wouldn’t have happened.*\n\n*I would never again help her out with those small branches that accumulated on the gutters above her kitchen window.*\n\n*She would never again lend me garbage bags that I always seemed to run out of.*\n\n*We can never ask each other “How’s work?” again.*\n\n*She will never hug me again.*\n\nFive days after her death, I got a call. It was Ginny’s dad Fred. He introduced himself matter-of-factly, and told me how he’d heard that me and Ginny were close neighbors, and looked out for each other. Although he seemed sure I had, he still asked if I’d heard the news. It was my turn to bury my sadness and matter-of-factly reply “Yes, I heard. I’m sorry for your loss, Mr. Murphy.” After a quick, meandering conversation between two heartbroken men, he asked me for a favor.\n\nFred couldn’t make it here for another few days. He said he needed some time to scrounge up enough money for the flights and funeral service, and seeing as me and Ginny were good neighbors, he wanted to ask if I could go over to her house and just see if everything was ‘alright’. When I asked him what he meant, he supposed that there might be some rotting food around, lights on, water leaking somewhere. The request took me by surprise, seeing as Ginny, as far as I knew, was always responsible, timely, and generally well equipped to take care of herself and her house. Even so, I obliged, saying I’d go and take a look and check that everything was okay.\n\nI didn’t want to go. I knew everything there would just remind me of Ginny.\n\n*Maybe our next date would’ve been at her house. Ordered some pizza and watched a movie.*\n\nIn the end, I respected her father’s grief, and decided to just get it over with. I took the emergency key she’d given me years ago and walked out my front door, around our shared fence, and up to her front porch. I tried not to think too much as I inserted the key into the keyhole, hoping to lock away all feelings and thoughts for the next five minutes. The door creaked familiarly as it opened, and I stepped inside, closing it behind me to keep the autumn cold out.\n\nThe whole first floor was dark. *Lights on, really Mr. Murphy?* \n\nI walked up to the kitchen and checked that there was no leakage from the sink or trash rotting in piles on the floor. Everything seemed completely normal, like the house was simply waiting for its owner to return from work. I walked around the rest of the first floor, wondering how on earth Fred could think that his daughter is some kind of inattentive slob. The house was clean and organized throughout, and it even smelled fresh. I decided to quickly scan the second floor and then leave, my promise thereby fulfilled. \n\nOnce I got to the second floor, I saw a small light emanating from the far end of the hall, behind a half-closed door. *Fine, one lamp, Fred. One.* I walked up to the room and opened the door, revealing a tidy, compact bedroom. One of the bedside lamps was on, producing a warm yellow glow. On the leftmost nightstand there was a stack of books, and closest to the bed one book had been left facing downwards, with its pages open in the middle, in the way that people with missing bookmarks often place their books down. The cover was completely black, with no visible text anywhere. Judging by its thickness, it might have been a very minimalistic bible.\n\nAs I started to move towards the bed, something in my mind did not agree with what I saw, forcing me to stop in my tracks and reassess. It took me a second to realize, but there was a shadow emerging from the edge of the light, near the bed. First it was a thin line, which slowly elongated and started to consume the glow unto itself. My heart jumped up to my throat, readying me to face whatever threat would emerge.\n\nThe shadow twisted and unfurled, elongated and stretched out as it took its final, familiar shape. My head felt hot and my hands cold as ice. It was Ginny’s shadow, the same one that left her for dead on that night at the parking lot. It moved like ink in water, swooshing in the light, its edges blurry and undefined - but it was definitely her, and like the previous time, I felt it *stare* at me. I froze and shivered as the room seemed to drop below freezing, my breath coming out in corrosive clouds. Then, I felt like someone had stabbed a thick needle into the back of my skull and injected my brain with coolant. Following this, a voice echoed inside of my head.\n\n*We know that you can see us. As you have noticed us, we have noticed you.*\n\n“W-who are you? What are you talking about? How are you talking to me… inside my head?” I replied automatically in thought, the mode of communication feeling surprisingly natural.\n\n*We are Keres, the eaters of death. We feast on blood and pray for destruction.*\n\nThe shadow opened its arms, shifting them as if to showcase the room.\n\n“Is Ginny with you?”\n\n*No. She is in a different place. We feasted upon her corpse. We thank you for your contribution - excellent timing. Without you she would have continued in the world of the living for much longer.*\n\n“I didn’t fucking kill her!” I tried to scream in spite of the paradox of raising the volume of thoughts in one’s mind.\n\n*No. But you made it possible, and we thank you again. On account of your help, we offer you this advice: if you have seen us, and we have seen you; other things lurk beneath that hold the same power.*\n\n“What things? More shadows?”\n\n*No. Moros.*\n\n“Who’s Moros?”\n\n*Death incarnate.*\n\nSuddenly, the shadow faded away, like those words were so deeply cursed that they needed to be left hanging in the air, unable to find a conversation to partake in. My mind was suddenly cleared, like the feeling of taking off noise-canceling headphones. The bedside lamp buzzed quietly, its light clear of all shadows.\n\nI walked up to the lamp, turned it off, and ran out of the house. Once I got back to mine, I didn’t turn on any lamps for the rest of the night, afraid of producing any more habitats for whatever I’d just seen… and talked to. I decided that the next day I'd call the doctor and try to move up my checkup -- something was definitely wrong with my mind.",

In the dark, a shadow followed me from room to room. It twitched, and its spine burst from its back like the wings of a desiccated angel.\n\nI was becoming undone, and I wondered how long Benji had taken to unravel.\n\nDespite that, I played the game as much as I could.\n\nIt was slowly becoming an obsession.\n\nI still went to work, fed and played with Marmalade, kissed Anya, and admired her cute butt.\n\nBut during my downtime, I played, and I played, and I played.\n\nI found more objects, unearthed sinister clues, and ran into the mansion’s inhabitants, who skulked through the halls faceless and moaning.\n\nI never saw Benji, and I didn’t know if that was good or bad.\n\nI progressed in the game and explored the second floor, which provided more hints, and introduced the game’s antagonist.\n\nIts name was HUNT.\n\nThe game did not instruct me how to beat it, so I hid and ran. I listened and watched from shrouded corners while it devoured everything in its path.\n\nAnya didn’t like me playing; actually, she hated the game. She had watched me play again, her face was stony, and without a word, she reached out and shut my tablet off.\n\n“You shouldn’t play this anymore,” she told me.\n\n“Why?” I asked. “What did you see?”\n\nBut she wouldn’t tell me, and whenever I took the game out to play, she would leave the room with Marmalade in her arms.\n\nShe grew distant, and I didn’t care. Who was she to tell me what to do?\n\nI knew things were going downhill, but I couldn’t stop even if I wanted to.\n\nAnd I didn’t.\n\nI looked for Benji. I searched for him everywhere. Sometimes I found pieces of him in crevices. Clumps of hair tangled in spider webs, splinters of bone wrapped in torn fabric.\n\nI stood by the steep stairs he had led me to.\n\n“I died here,” he had said, pointing to the staircase slick with gore. “My skull exploded.”\n\nI could see it happening so clearly. I could hear the wet gurgling as he took his last breath.\n\n# ❧\n\n# It was raining the next time I lost a life. Anya was working a double and wouldn’t be back until late, so it was just Marmalade and me.\n\nShe slept by my feet, and outside, the world roared. Rain lashed at the apartment’s windows, and thunder shook the room.\n\nThe lights flickered once, twice, and then went out.\n\nI held my breath and waited for it to turn back on. It did not.\n\nGroaning, I got up and groped blindly until I remembered I was stupid because my tablet had a flashlight. I turned it on and shone it into the darkness.\n\nI screamed.\n\nHUNT watched me in the dark. This video game nightmare had come to life and towered over me. It had tangled dirty hair, and a hunched broken back. Its breath came in sporadic gasps and whistles. I couldn’t see its face, and for that, I was glad because I knew it would look like Benji.\n\nI didn’t know what to do. I was frozen. Fuck, why didn’t life come with a walk-through? Why did Benji send me this fucked up game? Why did I continue to play even though I knew it was haunted?\n\nMarmalade hissed, and I broke out of my negging trance. I picked her up and ran out of the apartment. HUNT was right behind me.\n\nThe walls crumbled, and the ceiling caved in. The floor eroded, and with Marmalade clutched in my arms, we fell down this fucked up rabbit hole, drifting past mangled faces and disfigured limbs.\n\nI landed on my back the wind knocked me out of me. I struggled to breathe again and watched as the mansion built itself around us. We were in the game.\n\nWhen I could move, I realized we were at the top of the staircase, and Benji was below.\n\nBenji lay at the bottom landing, His neck was punctured by jagged bone, and his brains were spread around his head like a grisly halo.\n\nMarmalade flung herself out of my arms and landed on his chest. I watched as her pink tongue lapped at his dark blood. I turned my head and vomited.\n\n“Marmalade!” I hissed. My head was spinning. “Marmalade, stop it!”\n\nShe looked up at me and hissed with bloody teeth. Her furry orange face transformed into something bestial, hungry.\n\nI watched, horrified, as my precious kitty mutated as she crept up the stairs toward me. Her limbs elongated and became human, and her face changed and changed and changed.\n\nMost of the faces I did not know, and it did not shock me to see mine and Benji’s flicker across its features. The last one knocked all the wind out of my lungs. I struggled to breathe.\n\nAnya. Pretty Anya, whose pixie features made her look like a Black fairy, stared back at me. I would think it was her if that dirty black hair wasn’t framing her face and her teeth weren’t stained with Benji’s blood.\n\nWhy did HUNT have her face? As far as I knew, it only took your features when you played the game, and Anya hadn’t played so.\n\nWait. Fuck. Anya, what the fuck? Why?\n\nMy vision went white with sudden pain, and then everything went black. When I came to, my neck was burning, and dark blood splattered onto the floor. My fingers crawled over the wound and came away red, purple, and black. The light was fading, and so was the pain.\n\nI lay dying on the mansion’s dirty floor, HUNT standing above me, licking its bloodied fingers.\n\nIt leaned over me, and its face was Anya.\n\nIts lips spread in a smile, and in Anya’s voice, it said,\n\n“You’re finally home.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**GAME OVER**\n\n**LIFE TWO - YOU HAVE THREE LIVES LEFT**",

        "text": "The odds of getting struck by lightning in any given year are about one in a million, but for an average lifetime that’s just one in 15,300. Now, you’d think that if lighting *did* strike you, it would mean instant death, or at least imminent vegetation as your brains melt into scrambled eggs. In reality, around 90% of all victims survive.\n\nNow, that’s not to say that you can just walk off scot-free. Immediate symptoms of lightning strikes include, but are not limited to: \n\n* Heart asystole (basically a really, *really* bad heart attack)\n* Respiratory arrest (not breathing in enough oxygen to sustain bodily functions)\n* Burns (up to the third degree)\n* Broken bones\n* Hearing loss\n* Seizures\n\nWhen I woke up at the hospital, they told me I’d had prolonged respiratory arrest along with second degree burns. They said I was lucky, all things considered; I had been deprived of oxygen for quite some time, nearing cardiac arrest and organ failure. In short, I was brought back from the brink of death. Obviously, I was relieved, although confused, for at the time I could not recall *what* it was that almost killed me.\n\nOften, your physical body can bounce back somewhat quickly following a lightning strike. On the flip side, the most common long-term effects are neurological in nature, which include but are not limited to:\n\n* Sensory loss\n* Difficulty concentrating\n* Bouts of depression and/or anxiety\n* Shifts in mood\n* Changes in personality\n* Memory loss\n\nThe last thing I remembered was me getting a glass of water from the kitchen. There was a mild storm coming through the area, and I had been sitting in my lazy chair reading a book, when thirst had struck my dry throat. As I went to fill up my glass, something had pulled my body up and slung it across the kitchen. \n\nOf all lightning strikes, 32% happen indoors, which is not the same as storm clouds invading your home and attacking you like they’re minions of Zeus - and no, it’s not ball lightning either. Being in contact with landline telephones as well as poor plumbing are the most common causes. I live in an old house devoid of PVC piping, so their best guess was that lightning had struck somewhere near, or directly on my house, the electrical energy transferring to the metal piping, which connects to the tap. Unassumingly I had, at that exact moment, decided to pour myself a glass of water.\n\nI spent a week at the hospital. Each day the nurse would have to remind me of what had happened. I could remember my name, the date, the name of the president and all that, but the actual event slipped my mind each time. They did an EKG on me every day to check on my heart, which showed no signs of arrhythmia or other abnormalities.\n\nBy the end of the week I was finally feeling like myself again. My memory had improved, and I could remember exactly what had happened without it slipping my mind. My heart and other organs were doing fine, and the burns were healing well. I was told that there’s a chance I might feel depressed or anxious, especially in the upcoming weeks, and to call them if such symptoms persisted for more than a few days. They sent me home, and told me to schedule a follow-up in a couple of weeks.\n\nWhen I drove up the gravel driveway to my house, I saw my neighbor Ginny burst out from her front door and run up to my car. As I swung the door shut behind me, she jumped up and embraced me in a tight hug that would’ve pushed me onto the ground if not for the car catching us both. For a while she didn’t say anything, but then in a snap she let go, seeming slightly embarrassed at the forceful hug and the overstep in physical intimacy.\n\nGinny had been my neighbor for most of my adult life. I wouldn’t call us friends, but for two people living next to each other, we were quite close. We’d chat for a while anytime we bumped into each other, helped out with yard work, and kept an eye out for each other's property if one of us went on vacation. I’d never asked how old she was, assuming by her looks and similar life experiences that she was around my age: mid-thirties. She’d inherited the property from her mom, and had moved in a year before I had, almost a decade ago.\n\nGinny took a step back and looked me up and down, her gaze lingering on the bandages on my arms covering the burns. “Jesus, Nick, I thought you died. I tried calling the hospital but they wouldn’t say anything since I’m not family. You’d think they’d at least give some update to whoever called them in the first place, for fuck’s sake.”\n\n“They didn’t tell me you were the one who called 911,” I replied. “Thanks, Ginny. I mean if it wasn’t for that -- for *you*, I probably would have been dead.”\n\n“Glad you’re not,” she said, her mouth strict and taut in concern, her eyes wide in relief.\n\nI gave her a wide smile. “Me too.”\n\nGinny asked me about the burns, the hospital food, the EKG - everything. It felt good to unload, and she was happy to listen. At that moment, I realized how much she cared for my well being, and similarly how much of myself I wanted to share with her. I guess all it required was a near-death experience for us to realize these things.\n\nAs our conversation started to drift off, the pauses becoming longer and the turns to speak shorter, I was about to ask her to join me for a cup of coffee. She interrupted the small silence that had brewed just as I was about to open my mouth.\n\n“You should go and get some rest, Nick. And let’s talk more soon, okay?” And if you need a ride for your checkup, I’m glad to drive.”\n\n“Yeah, yeah… of course,” I muttered as I redacted the invitation in my mind. “And you get some rest too, I wouldn’t want you worrying any more about me. And maybe I’ll take you up on that offer.”\n\nGinny flashed a wide smile and looked into my eyes. “Good night.”\n\n“Good night, Ginny, and really…” I paused for a moment, forgetting how the sentence was supposed to continue as butterflies started to fly and flicker in my stomach. “Thanks again. For listening. And talking. And see you soon.”\n\nShe turned around and started walking back to her house. I stood there for a second and followed her with my eyes, feeling like for the first time I’d really *seen* her, presently mesmerized by what I had unearthed. She glanced back at me with a smile, and I nearly jumped from embarrassment, blushing like I’d somehow been found out. I speed walked the rest of the way up to my house, realizing something crucial: *she had glanced back.*\n\nOne side-effect of lightning strikes they didn’t care to mention was the half-empty fridge and the mound of expired food that awaited my arrival. I didn’t have anything to eat, and after a week of hospital food I *really* wanted some real food. So after a round trip at my house, I headed back out to get some groceries, feeling like I should’ve realized this would happen earlier.\n\nResuming my regular life was depressing. Not because my life sucked, but because, *apparently*  even if I get hit by goddamn lightning the chores and bills piled up as if nothing had happened. The monotony and bureaucracy of ordinary life would probably hunt me to my grave, the bills for the funeral service sent with me six feet under. Even Charon collected a toll to cross the river Styx for the *privilege* of getting into Hades.\n\nRoutine helped. Monotony by definition is constant, so that helps the brain do the thing that the brain does. After a week I was back in full swing, the accident transforming from a living instance to a memory. What bothered me most, though, is that every day as I pulled up to my driveway, I was hoping that Ginny would once more run up to me in that warm embrace she’d given me a week ago. I didn’t wish to get struck by lightning again, but I did wish that me and Ginny could pretend I had, so we could talk more.\n\nOne warm evening as I was doing groceries, I saw something… weird. There was a large, middle-aged man pushing a cart past me, his body pressing up against me without his knowledge. I glanced at him as he moved past, following him with my eyes in slight annoyance. As he turned the isle, it looked like his shadow had lingered. Like somehow the light lagged, glitched, or distorted in some way that made it seem like him and his shadow separated. I shrugged it off and continued with my shopping.\n\nAs I previously stated, neurological conditions are the number one after-effect of lightning strikes. Soon, I started to worry that there was some short-circuit of the brain happening, since after the man at the store I’d started to notice more and more disembodied shadows. I’d see people walking, and their shadow would simply stop following them, like a lazy dog on a walk it didn’t want to continue. Sometimes I’d see people without shadows at all, and vice versa; shadows in the mangled shapes of people that didn’t seem to have a beginning point.\n\nThe checkup wasn’t due for another two weeks, so I thought I’d just ride out whatever this was. Some slight problem with my eyesight didn’t seem too far fetched with all the other malfunctions my body had gone through as a gigajoule of energy pulsated through my organs and boiled my blood. Whatever this was, I reckoned there was a good chance it’d go away on its own. I tried not to look at the shadows, hoping they’d resolve themselves back to their originators in the meantime. \n\nSoon after, I stumbled upon a stroke of luck: I bumped into Ginny. We took out our trash at the same time (or maybe I waited until I heard her go out and then ran after her, *oh what a coincidence*) and had a conversation near the bins. Romantic, I know. We didn’t talk about anything too deep, the warmth of last week seemingly worn off. But to my surprise, she asked me out for coffee the next day. Thrilled, but trying to seem calm, I replied with an abnormally loud “yES,” like I’d just re-entered puberty and my voice had started to crack.\n\nCoffee went great. At the beginning we were both awkward, but soon the conversation just started rolling. We’d known each other for so long, yet we’d never talked for this long at a time; it was a weird concoction of familiarity and the unknown, like a painting that has been on your wall for what seemed like eternity that you didn’t know the artist of, or the year that it was produced. \n\nI learned more about her family, and how her mom got the house. How her dad lived a couple states away, so they don’t see each other very often. How, when she was little, she tried to mimic adults by pouring a dollop of coffee into her chocolate milk and calling it a latte. In the end, we’d talked for hours and probably had eight cups of coffee amongst us. Neither of us wanted to leave, but Ginny reminded me that a) we both have regular adult things to do, b) the coffee shop was about to close, and more importantly c) we can continue this on our *next date*. I guess lightning can strike twice.\n\nI walked Ginny to her car. It was early evening, the sun setting lazily and the parking lot lights providing us with a dim spotlight. We said our goodnights, and as if she’d anticipated my wish, she gave me a warm, big hug. This time she didn’t grip me like she didn’t want to say goodbye, like she had when I came back from the hospital, instead holding me like she would someone she’d be hugging again very soon.\n\nAs she entered her car and started to drive off, I noticed something *wrong*. Her shadow hadn’t followed her to the car, instead standing in the middle of the parking space. It was clearly *her* shadow, the spotlights drawing her distinct figure and long, flowy hair in inky dark lines. Now, this might sound ridiculous, but I tried to *shoo* the shadow away, like it was a stray dog. A bit less ridiculous sounding: the shadow didn’t heed my command. Instead, it stood there, wavering between rays of evening sun spilling over the horizon. It felt like the shadow *stared* at me, like we were partaking in a silent conversation.\n\nAdhering to my previous commitment, I tried to ignore the shadow and started to walk towards my car. I got in and sat there for a moment, the coffee and Ginny still warm and sweet inside my heart, but her disembodied shadow a pinprick in the otherwise excellent evening. I took a few deep breaths and put the key into the ignition, ready to hit the road.\n\nThen I heard it.\n\nA crash coming from the main road, loud enough to pierce all thoughts in two in a thunderous demand for attention. Obliging to its request, I exited the vehicle and moved toward the road.\n\nWhat unveiled itself was a waking nightmare I wouldn’t wish on anyone.\n\nA truck had t-boned a car as it pulled out of the parking lot and into the road. The truck’s speed must have been enormous, or maybe it was just a small thing getting outweighed and beaten by the bigger thing, speed unaccounted for.\n\nAs I saw the car, realizing it was Ginny’s off-white Toyota, I started to run, hoping to help, get Ginny out, call an ambulance, *something.* As I got closer I realized there was nothing I could do, my feet slowing down in anticipation of pure hopelessness. The truck driver had already jumped out of his vehicle and was looking at the wreckage stuck to the nose of his truck. The driver and his 18 wheeled hearse seemed to not have a scratch on either of them. Ginny wasn’t as lucky.\n\nGinny’s car was the shape of a fortune cookie, twisted and cracked in the middle, its ends pointed like the tips of a boomerang. Inside, her head laid on the forward-facing air bag, which, in the sideways collision had only helped to prop up her mangled body. Twisted metal strings and pipes had punctured her torso, coloring her blouse a crimson red. Her eyes were open, looking at the truck as if she was still waiting for it to pass before merging onto the road. Her legs were crushed and consumed by the vehicle, coalescing with the steel and oil and faux leather upholstery.\n\nThe last neurons in her brain fought valiantly until they too abandoned their post as she was being taken to the hospital. They told me she’d been in a vegetative state the instant she was hit, but her lungs worked for some fifteen minutes longer until she finally drowned in her own blood.\n\nFor the next few days, grief and guilt burrowed themselves deep into my soul. \n\n*I should have refused the coffee date.*\n\n*I should have kept her there for longer, then the accident wouldn’t have happened.*\n\n*I would never again help her out with those small branches that accumulated on the gutters above her kitchen window.*\n\n*She would never again lend me garbage bags that I always seemed to run out of.*\n\n*We can never ask each other “How’s work?” again.*\n\n*She will never hug me again.*\n\nFive days after her death, I got a call. It was Ginny’s dad Fred. He introduced himself matter-of-factly, and told me how he’d heard that me and Ginny were close neighbors, and looked out for each other. Although he seemed sure I had, he still asked if I’d heard the news. It was my turn to bury my sadness and matter-of-factly reply “Yes, I heard. I’m sorry for your loss, Mr. Murphy.” After a quick, meandering conversation between two heartbroken men, he asked me for a favor.\n\nFred couldn’t make it here for another few days. He said he needed some time to scrounge up enough money for the flights and funeral service, and seeing as me and Ginny were good neighbors, he wanted to ask if I could go over to her house and just see if everything was ‘alright’. When I asked him what he meant, he supposed that there might be some rotting food around, lights on, water leaking somewhere. The request took me by surprise, seeing as Ginny, as far as I knew, was always responsible, timely, and generally well equipped to take care of herself and her house. Even so, I obliged, saying I’d go and take a look and check that everything was okay.\n\nI didn’t want to go. I knew everything there would just remind me of Ginny.\n\n*Maybe our next date would’ve been at her house. Ordered some pizza and watched a movie.*\n\nIn the end, I respected her father’s grief, and decided to just get it over with. I took the emergency key she’d given me years ago and walked out my front door, around our shared fence, and up to her front porch. I tried not to think too much as I inserted the key into the keyhole, hoping to lock away all feelings and thoughts for the next five minutes. The door creaked familiarly as it opened, and I stepped inside, closing it behind me to keep the autumn cold out.\n\nThe whole first floor was dark. *Lights on, really Mr. Murphy?* \n\nI walked up to the kitchen and checked that there was no leakage from the sink or trash rotting in piles on the floor. Everything seemed completely normal, like the house was simply waiting for its owner to return from work. I walked around the rest of the first floor, wondering how on earth Fred could think that his daughter is some kind of inattentive slob. The house was clean and organized throughout, and it even smelled fresh. I decided to quickly scan the second floor and then leave, my promise thereby fulfilled. \n\nOnce I got to the second floor, I saw a small light emanating from the far end of the hall, behind a half-closed door. *Fine, one lamp, Fred. One.* I walked up to the room and opened the door, revealing a tidy, compact bedroom. One of the bedside lamps was on, producing a warm yellow glow. On the leftmost nightstand there was a stack of books, and closest to the bed one book had been left facing downwards, with its pages open in the middle, in the way that people with missing bookmarks often place their books down. The cover was completely black, with no visible text anywhere. Judging by its thickness, it might have been a very minimalistic bible.\n\nAs I started to move towards the bed, something in my mind did not agree with what I saw, forcing me to stop in my tracks and reassess. It took me a second to realize, but there was a shadow emerging from the edge of the light, near the bed. First it was a thin line, which slowly elongated and started to consume the glow unto itself. My heart jumped up to my throat, readying me to face whatever threat would emerge.\n\nThe shadow twisted and unfurled, elongated and stretched out as it took its final, familiar shape. My head felt hot and my hands cold as ice. It was Ginny’s shadow, the same one that left her for dead on that night at the parking lot. It moved like ink in water, swooshing in the light, its edges blurry and undefined - but it was definitely her, and like the previous time, I felt it *stare* at me. I froze and shivered as the room seemed to drop below freezing, my breath coming out in corrosive clouds. Then, I felt like someone had stabbed a thick needle into the back of my skull and injected my brain with coolant. Following this, a voice echoed inside of my head.\n\n*We know that you can see us. As you have noticed us, we have noticed you.*\n\n“W-who are you? What are you talking about? How are you talking to me… inside my head?” I replied automatically in thought, the mode of communication feeling surprisingly natural.\n\n*We are Keres, the eaters of death. We feast on blood and pray for destruction.*\n\nThe shadow opened its arms, shifting them as if to showcase the room.\n\n“Is Ginny with you?”\n\n*No. She is in a different place. We feasted upon her corpse. We thank you for your contribution - excellent timing. Without you she would have continued in the world of the living for much longer.*\n\n“I didn’t fucking kill her!” I tried to scream in spite of the paradox of raising the volume of thoughts in one’s mind.\n\n*No. But you made it possible, and we thank you again. On account of your help, we offer you this advice: if you have seen us, and we have seen you; other things lurk beneath that hold the same power.*\n\n“What things? More shadows?”\n\n*No. Moros.*\n\n“Who’s Moros?”\n\n*Death incarnate.*\n\nSuddenly, the shadow faded away, like those words were so deeply cursed that they needed to be left hanging in the air, unable to find a conversation to partake in. My mind was suddenly cleared, like the feeling of taking off noise-canceling headphones. The bedside lamp buzzed quietly, its light clear of all shadows.\n\nI walked up to the lamp, turned it off, and ran out of the house. Once I got back to mine, I didn’t turn on any lamps for the rest of the night, afraid of producing any more habitats for whatever I’d just seen… and talked to. I decided that the next day I'd call the doctor and try to move up my checkup -- something was definitely wrong with my mind.",

        "text": "Earlier in the night, I went to the gas station for some allergy medicine, as I'd been sneezing and coughing all day, and it had finally gotten to the point where I couldn’t even function, mentally or physically. While walking in, a gentlemen dressed in what I can only describe as a theater jester’s attire—not a modern clown’s costume, but something more elaborate, and archaic—stopped me, and asked about my reasons for entering. His words were strangely lyrical, rhythmic in form though erratically spoken – like some crackhead bard.  \n\n***What is it that plagues you, my wayward friend?***  \n\n***Is there an illness or ailment you wish to end?*** \n\nSeeing as how I’d never been accosted by a gas station jester before, I figured I’d humor him for a moment. There were plenty of security cameras on the premises, and a few customers inside, so I wasn’t exactly worried for my safety.  \n\nWell, I explained my dilemma to him, gesturing to my swollen face and mucous-leaking nose, for added effect. He nodded solemnly, as if he too had suffered such a condition could whole-heartedly empathize. With a pinkly gloved hand, he reached into a pocket in his costume and retrieved a small leather pouch, which he then extended to me. Perhaps a little delirious in my allergy-addled state, I accepted the pouch without question. Loosening the string that had fastened it shut, I peered inside and found three little capsules. They were black and translucent, their inner contents – a fine grey powder – barely visible through the dark casing.  \n\nI looked up to the jester, and he again wordlessly nodded, as if in those capsules lay the solution to my problem. He then smiled, and with a quickness I wouldn’t have thought him capable, skipped away – backwards – into an alley beside the building. The soft tinkling of his hat’s bells echoed off into the night, seeming to augur something cryptic, if not outright baleful.  \n\nBarely able to stand at this point, I went inside the gas station, bought a bottle of water, and returned to my car. More and more I began to believe the jester’s unspoken suggestion, that the capsules would in fact rid me of my body’s attack upon itself.  \n\nHungrily, desperately, *foolishly*, I threw the capsules into my mouth and drowned them with a heavy sip of water.  \n\nThe reaction was immediate, electrifying – unlike anything I'd ever experienced before. Thankfully, I had not yet started to drive; had remained in the gas station parking lot throughout the cross-dimensional foray into fantastic spaces and environs.... \n\n***Thrown back in time, through bygone cycles,*** ***anterior epochs before the Bible; old stories of evil and primal*** ***rivals, atrocities daily just for survival….*** \n\nAllergic to pollen, popped a pill, antihistamine-induced atavism; antediluvian anachronisms, wrapped in black ectoplasm and spat back into the past. \n\nTripping off that Benadryl, no standing still, rampantly trampling Cyclopean anthills. Monstrous man-horrors crawling forth from coniferous landforms, grinning ghoulishly whilst picking at ass sores. \n\nPterodactyls sweepin, proto-Draculas creepin, primordial slime-things sleepin while timelessly keepin their minds inclined toward undivine thinkin. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNoctivagant octopi occupying noxious oil spills \n\nWinged things perched up and mingling, \n\nRoaming beasts throwing heat looking for a thrill \n\nExtraordinarily horrid flora got me tingling. \n\nI'm allergic to this shit, too – I got an inkling. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTerror-maxxed, on that unspeakable grindset \n\nLeaches have latched – bout to be bloodlet  \n\nPhlebotomized, terrorized, an addled target. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStumbling through the swampish waters,  \n\nRacing through the fens, \n\nFending off the bog-lain monsters,  \n\nThe marshlands have no end. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Chthonic capital sits before me, spires of stone and mud, \n\nHadean phantoms flit and flurry, pleading for my blood \n\nOaken stakes betoken fates incompatible with my life, \n\nDerelict guillotines imply a preference for the butcher's knife. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis olden outpost of Martian reign, \n\nThose otherworldly visitants from the crimson terrain \n\nHad lived upon the Earth’s young face, \n\nAnd held dominion, with ziggurat and fane \n\nBut of now there is not the faintest trace. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI breach the ramparts of that time-lost fortress, \n\nIts soldiers take aim from lofty turrets \n\nBlackly armored sentinels who mean me duress \n\nFor it is with my blood they’ll moisten their gullets \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA portal opens, diphenhydramine departure  \n\nA man-sized flaming aperture,  \n\nEnraptured, I lurch through the window before I'm captured.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMeta-cosmic machinations spirit me through multi-dimensional computations of spacetime and quasi-spatial anomalies, in a state of nonentity while anonymous Andromedans dance nonchalantly atop nonagons and other polygonal platforms placed paradoxically parallel to my point of end. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack in bed, the portal shimmers and closes, \n\nIt’s finally over; Thank God, Jesus, and Moses \n\nLights are off, though feels like something is lurking \n\nOnly one way to scare it off: gotta start jerkin. \n\nA tittering, a cackling, fades into the night \n\nA hounding fiend dismissed by masturbatory might \n\nAnd thus ended my bizarre, hyper-real adventure into pre-human periods of Earthen life. My allergies are gone – though I feel as if I’ve been touched, *marked* by something arcane and spectral; some invisible, intangible symbol or rune of the far-flung past. Despite the terrors I faced, the horrors made known to me, I have a strange yearning to return to those azoic biomes, to venture rearward in Time and bask in that still-nascent sunlight, and listen to the squawks, croaks, and bleating of life-forms long-dead, of beasts and primordial Things whose morphologies would puzzle and terrify the zoologist and arachnologists; would send the herpetologist to the asylum, and would cause the botanist to reevaluate the supposed unintelligence of their subjects.... \n\nAnd, nearly as much, I miss the sudden, inexplicable propensity for a lyrical expression of my thoughts; the poetic ruminations, the verse-maker's musings.... \n\nI must find that Jester and obtain more of his wondrous, time-defying medicine. This mundane world of metal and machinery is not for me.",

        "text": "Have you ever misplaced something just for a moment to realize it’s seemingly gone missing? Usually it’s small things. Loose change, or maybe a pencil. It rolls out of sight, and when you check, you usually find it in a few moments. \n\nBut what about the things you don’t find? Days turn to weeks, weeks turn to months, and months to years, but those missing things never turn up. Where do you suppose those things go? I often wondered about that myself, but something happened to me that finally put my doubts to rest. Please, bear with me. This might sound a little crazy.\n\nIt all started years ago; I was still in middle school back then. My parents usually worked nights, and being an only child meant I was home alone most of the time. Of course, they didn’t see that as a problem, it was a safe community, and I know now that my parents needed the money. Being a kid in the 2000s, there wasn’t much to do. Thankfully I had my Gameboy Advance to keep myself occupied. \n\nSo there I was, on the living room couch, my legs propped over the armrest. The game screen flickered to life, and I began to play Pokémon Ruby. I had gotten the game earlier that week, and was making good progress. After just a few hours, I was at the elite four. It wasn’t exactly nighttime yet, but it was getting there. I could feel daylight slowly fading. After a while of playing, I was famished, so I left my spot on the couch to go get something to eat, tossing the Gameboy back as I walked off. \n\nA few minutes later, I returned with a plate full of cheese and crackers. The music of the game sounded muffled, distant, actually. I let out a chuckle as I realized what had happened. The Gameboy must have slipped through the cushions when I tossed it onto the couch. My hands plunged into the depths of the couch as though I was digging for buried treasure. Feeling along the sides of the couch for my Gameboy, I noticed something very odd; the deeper my arm went, the more distant the music sounded. I would have said it was falling down a pit if I didn't know better. \n\n“C’mon, where are you?... Ow!” I yanked my hand free of the cushion, and there was a light cut along the entire back of it. Not deep enough to draw blood, but it had torn the skin. \n\nI gripped the cushion and dragged it completely off the couch in retaliation. My eyes met with an unexpected sight. There was a circular hole right underneath the cushion. The hole was big, almost as big as the cushion that laid on top of it. The sight was eerie, my spine tingled, and my blood ran cold just from looking at it. \n\n“What the hell? Has that always been there?” I whispered to myself. \n\nI was terrified, yet I could still notice the dull flicker of the Gameboy’s light twinkling from within the hole. It felt like it was falling, and the deeper it plummeted, the more the light faded. Its shrill, high-pitched jingle had waned to a whisper. \n\nNot soon after that, the small light in the darkness vanished. Did it reach the bottom? Had it broke? Or was it so far gone that it simply was no longer visible? \n\nSlowly, cautiously, I reached for the hole. My fingers twitched as they grazed the corner of the couch. I was scared, but there was no way I was letting my Gameboy go. I plunged my hand into the hole. I was shocked to find the other side surprisingly roomy. I even had enough space to swipe from side to side. Then without warning, something grabbed my arm. It yanked and tugged so hard that I feared my arm would be ripped right off. \n\n“Crap! Shit!! Fuck!!!” I stammered as I struggled to no avail. Within a split second, I was sucked into the hole. It felt like I was falling into a dark, soggy well with no bottom. I screamed till my face turned blue. The echo of my voice rang in my ears. Were my eyes even open anymore? I couldn’t tell. It felt like I was having one of those falling dreams, only I wasn’t waking up, no matter how hard I tried.\n\nThe feeling of being weightless and being unable to see made my senses numb. I don’t know how long I fell, but a sudden thud knocked every sense back into me. My body was rolling down a hill. By the time my momentum stopped carrying me downward, my whole body was sore and bruised. Slowly, I pushed through the pain and rose to my feet. My knees wobbled, and my legs felt hollow, but I endured it. \n\nFinally, after taking a few minutes to catch my breath. I looked around me and was stunned by what I saw. There were mountains of toys, trinkets, and dolls everywhere I looked. Anything you could think of was right there. Each knick-knack glistened flawlessly. My jaw hung open, and my eyes were ready and primed to pop out of their sockets. \n\n“Wow, where am I?” I whispered to myself. The only sounds I could hear were the echo of my voice and the metallic clanking of more things falling from the sky. \n\nIt was like a landfill but shinier. I tried to walk but slipped on a small pile of coins. My hand shot out and grabbed hold of something, and I barely stopped myself from taking another tumble downwards into the dump. \n\nThe coins jingled all the way down. Some fell into cracks and crevices, but others continued to bounce and find their way down further and further. It felt like I was standing over a ledge. One wrong move, and I would fall God knows how far. \n\nThere were mountains of treasure everywhere I looked. A vast ocean of missing items stretched as far as the eye could see. The only light source was from an arrangement of holes above each pile, high in the sky. Pale beams of light filtered through them, cascading to the pile below like sun rays piercing through dark clouds.\n\n“Look at all this stuff!” I muttered to myself. \n\nNow, you’d think a child would panic under these circumstances? Cry out, scream, or maybe even wet himself. Surprisingly, I did none of those. There were so many things that caught my attention. In a way, this was like a dream come true. I could have anything I wanted here. Every knick-knack, gizmo, and doodad was mine for the taking! My little hands fumbled through every bit of the pile. Already shoulder deep, I felt as if my hand sunk even deeper until it grasped a familiar shape. When I pulled it out, there was a small, green cartridge. The front had that familiar, yet also unfamiliar wording. “Pokémon Emerald”\n\n“Awesome! A new pokemon game!!” I yelled.\n\nI had nearly every game up to this point, but I’d never heard of an Emerald version; maybe it was one of those ROM hacks I’d heard about. I stuck it in my pocket and continued searching. Now, I wasn’t at all familiar with what I grabbed next, but I knew enough to know it was a Yugioh card. “Armed Dragon LV7”. \n\n“A super rare Yugioh card! That’s so cool!” I yelled even louder. “ Wait till mom and dad hear about this!” \n\nThe card glimmered all over, from the text to the background image on it. I shoved it in my pocket and dug my hand deeper still. If I could find so much incredible stuff at the top of the pile, surely the bottom would have even better trinkets. Suddenly, my hands grazed against something that felt soft, even organic. It definitely wasn’t made of plastic. \n\n“Oh I wonder…” I said as I tugged on it. At first, the object didn’t give, but with enough force a wet squelch could be heard as it came free. My face contorted in horror as I saw a severed arm in my hand. It had begun to fester and rot. Strips of flesh hung from its bones. \n\n“Aaaah!” I let out an ear-splitting shriek and tossed it away. Instinctively, I ran as fast as my short legs could carry me. I skidded to a halt and then stood before a large flat screen TV. It wasn’t the TV that caught my attention, it was something else. Scrawled in blood on the TV's shimmering screen were the words:\n\n‘Beware the Collectors.’\n\n“The Collectors? What’s that?” I muttered. Suddenly, a whole television set crashed a few inches away from me, and a landslide began. I slid down even further until I found myself at the base of the mound. \n\nThe bottom was dark and moldy. The smell was horrible, as if something had just decided to pass away in the summer sun. It took all my strength to hold down the few slices of cheese and crackers I had earlier. \n\n\"Okay, that's it, I've seen enough! I wanna go home…\" I whimpered, fighting back the tears that had begun to well in my eyes. I wanted to just click my heels and reappear in my house. \n\nJust a few feet away lay the largest bird I’d ever seen, or what remained of it at least. A vulture, possibly a condor? The majority of its feathers had long since been plucked from its body, along with its insides. The creature had been hollowed out and left to dry in the damp dark. What could have done such a thing to a bird of prey?\n\nIt was at that moment that I heard a spine-tingling scream. Now, when I say scream, I don’t mean a shout or even someone yelling. It was a guttural, heart-wrenching screech. The noise continued to ring out, and I followed after it, over a small mound and through a tunnel of debris. \n\nThough the tunnel was only a few inches wide, I was just small enough to wriggle my way through with small resistance. I squeezed out the other side, and what I saw next shocked me to my core. No more than a dozen meters away, a person was lying on the ground in a pool of his own blood. His entrails sprawled out on the floor. Three small creatures stood over the man. They looked gaunt and sickly. Their quivering skin scintillated with the purest shades of obsidian. They had six arms sticking out of their torsos, three on each side. Small pouches lined their backs like the pockets of a shirt; each was stuffed with gold, rubies, and other forms of jewelry. Their black, beady eyes had a soulless glint about them. \n\nThese creatures surrounded the man. One held him down while others dug into his body. Two others tugged on his intestines until a wet pop rippled through the air, followed by another scream. Their mouths made strange clicking noises as they devoured him. That was something I never wanted to hear again, even the memory of it causes my stomach to turn. \n\nI was petrified. All I could do was watch silently as those disgusting creatures clawed, gnawed, and stuffed the man’s innards into their pockets. An image of the television screen flashed through my mind. ‘Beware the Collectors’ I thought as I stared onward. \n\nSeeing the man’s bloody remains made me realize everything I had collected until that point was worthless. I knew I needed to find a way out of this place and fast. \n\nSlowly, cautiously, I began to retreat, but my hand inadvertently nicked a toy. Without warning, the toy robot made a squawky ticking noise and colorful lights began to strobe out.\n\nThis immediately attracted the Collectors’ attention. Their large, malformed heads snapped toward me. The Collectors shrieked so loudly that the whole place seemed to reverberate from the sound of their eerie, high-pitched voice. \n\nMy legs tottered. My arms were heavy, and to my surprise, they were full of trinkets and shiny objects. Honestly, I don’t even know when I had picked all of this stuff up. I let go of the load I was carrying, and it all clattered to the ground. I made a run for it, turning my neck to steal glances at them with each stride. Three of the creatures quickly gave chase and were hot on my heels. I had thought that the creatures were naturally obsidian-colored before, but closer now, I could see it was dried blood. \n\nI sprang through the narrow space I crawled out from. The tunnel was seemingly smaller now, but I tore and clawed at anything in my way and threw whatever I could back at the little killers behind me. It was just enough to slow them down, and I escaped the tunnel, now running down a path between mountains of treasure. Any thoughts of retrieving my Gameboy had left me, I just wanted to get out of there, to go home. I managed to lose one of them as I sprinted. But there were still two hot on my tracks.\n\n“Help! Someone help me!” I cried as the impish creatures gained ground. \n\nNo matter how far I ran or the turns I made through this winding labyrinth, the creatures always found me. Their line of sight was never broken for more than a few meager seconds. \n\nFinally, I broke out into a clearing. The only thing in sight was a giant, marooned ship. There was a large hole in the hull, and as I ran up to it. For a split second, I wondered what a massive ship like this could be doing here. Then all those documentaries I saw about ships and planes getting lost in the Bermuda Triangle flashed across my mind. Tiny items like paper clips, pencils, jewelry, and erasers weren’t the only thing that got lost but big things like planes and cars also got lost too. \n\nThe violent taps of the Collectors’ footsteps broke my train of thought. I bolted through the breach in the hull. \n\nThe ship's interior was moldy and rusted; every inch of its metallic frame filled my heart with dread. But nothing could compare to the terror I felt from the monsters pursuing me. I zoomed up a set of stairs. Each staircase creaked noisily, ready to snap at a moment's notice. I nearly fell through as I stomped hard on the last staircase, but I caught myself and staggered forward. The Collectors stopped at the foot of the stairs. They watched for a few pensive moments, snapping and snarling at me before they slipped into the darkness.\n\nI remember wondering why they stopped chasing me then, and I couldn’t fathom any reason, I was glad they did though. But I knew I wasn’t out of the woods yet. Not by a long shot. I made my way up the second set of stairs. My initial thoughts were just to escape the Collectors that were chasing me, but now my thoughts led me to believe that maybe there was a shiny weapon.\n\nMy palm met the side of my head, and I smacked it several times.  “No, no… It doesn’t need to be shiny…” I whispered to myself. \n\nLooking out into the distance at the mountains of things, my heart couldn’t help but flutter in my chest. Something about this place, it was warping my way of thinking, even my actions, to an extent. I couldn’t let that happen again, or else… The image of the man on the floor flashed through my mind, and the butterflies in my chest quickly turned to dread in the pit of my stomach. \n\nMy eyes scanned the deck, and I realized that it was empty. There were no weapons, nothing to defend myself with. All that was left was the Captain's quarters. The handle didn’t turn, and the door didn’t budge. There was a clicking noise to my side, but when I looked, there was nothing. I knew one of those things was still stalking me. Lurking in the dark. Waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike. \n\n“C’mon, c’mon…” I stuttered as I shoved the door repeatedly. \n\nBy this point, I was practically throwing myself at the door, trying to force myself inside. I heard more skittering, clawing, and scratching between my attempts. Finally, the Collector threw itself over the ship's rails and onto the deck. It stared at me with beady black eyes. Grinning from ear to ear. Its little black gums glimmered through as it approached. \n\nI pounded on the door some more to no avail. The Collector threw itself at me and pushed me to the ground. Its small, black fingers fit snugly around my wrist. The first thing I noticed was its touch, but then its smell. Its odor was a mixture of rusted pennies and rotten flesh. The scent of iron filled my lungs, and I had to hold my breath. It was so overpowering I almost gagged on my own puke. I could feel my heart beating in my ears. Fear coursed through my body, and it was what it wanted. I tried to pry my arm free, to escape, but it didn’t budge. It squeezed my wrist. At first, it was light, but more pressure was added like a vice. My free hand clamped over my mouth to try and stifle a scream. The thought of what had happened to the last man that screamed was still fresh in my mind, and I held it back as a sickening crunch echoed. \n\nMy hand felt around in my pocket now, and I pulled out the card I had found earlier. “Armed Dragon LV7”. I held it just inches from the creature's face, and the round, black orb-like eyes followed it. When it clawed for the card, I tossed it as far as I could, and my wrist was freed as it ran towards the card. \n\nThe door was no good. I had to run, but where? My only choice was to get past it and go back down the stairs. No more than a few steps, and I lost my footing. I was on the ground once again. I tried to push myself up, but my wrist screamed out in pain. When I looked up, the creature that had been obsessing over the card tossed it to the side. My back was pressed against the mast, and I kicked at the Collector. It mounted me and began to claw at me. Its talon-like nails dug into my skin, blood spattered with each swipe. I felt as if my flesh was being flayed. I couldn’t hold back any longer, and I screamed. \n\nI thought I would regret it. That a swarm of them would be coming now, but something entirely different happened. There was a bang on the door to the Captain's quarters. It was so strong, the door nearly blew off its hinges. My head snapped around, the same as the Collectors. With the next shove, the door broke free, and the glass around it shattered. My assailant had stopped attacking me, but my heart was ready to burst just as the door had. What could be standing within the Captain’s quarters? A bear? Something even worse than the Collectors? I was too scared to know. \n\nI shut my eyes tight. There was one more thud and then a violent whimper, it almost sounded like a puppy crying. Then suddenly, silence. My entire body was shaking at this point. Honestly, I just wanted to sink into the ship's mast and be back in my house, but that didn’t happen. Then I heard the sound of a female voice speaking up.\n\n“It’s okay now, I got rid of him. You can open your eyes.” A woman's voice rang out, but my body refused to move. Every muscle was tensed up to the point that it was frozen still. “Are you gonna open your eyes, or do I have to do it for you?” \n\nNot a moment had passed before I felt fingertips prying my eyelids open, and I jerked away from her hands. She wasn’t anything as I expected. A small frame and a long, frilly dress. She looked like one of those Barbie dolls I see girls always play with. Her skin looked as polished and smooth as porcelain. Her arms were long and slender. Her bedraggled blond hair was wrapped into a ponytail. I was never any good at telling women’s ages, but I would say she looked to be in her early twenties.\n\nShe grabbed hold of me and pulled me to my feet. Her hands rummaged through my pockets, a wave of discomfort and some other unknown feeling rushed through me. Getting frisked by a tall blonde woman wasn’t exactly an activity a middle schooler was used to. \n\n“Hey, what are you-?!” \n\nShe grabbed the Pokémon cartridge I had picked up earlier and yanked it out. Her hand closed around it, and tiny bits of scrap metal and plastic fell when she opened it again. \n\n“Is that everything? Did you take anything else?” She asked, her big, glassy eyes flashing. \n\nI was still too scared to speak. What was with that monstrous strength of hers? \n\n“I said did you take anything else!?” Much harsher this time, she hissed the question at me.\n\nAll I could do was stutter out a response. “N-No! That was all I took, I swear!” \n\nWith this, she seemed relieved and let out a small sigh. \n\n“That’s good. Now, what’s your name?” It was strange how the pitch of her voice was able to change so drastically. She sounded so angry just a moment ago; now, it was as if an angel had blessed my ears with her voice. \n\n“M-Miles, my name is Miles...\" was all I could stutter out in response. I had fallen back against the mast once again. My world was spinning. \n\nThe woman knelt down before me and took my hands in hers. \"Well, Miles, it's very nice to meet you. My name is Marianne!\" \n\nShe gave my wrist a little squeeze, and then pulled my hand out, and then closed it. I winced in pain, but this just caused Marianne to chuckle.\n\n\"Thankfully, it's not broken. Can you walk?\" \n\nI stood once again, and this time I was able to make it two whole steps before I fell over. Thankfully she caught me this time. \n\n\"I guess there's no helping it. Come on, I'll give you a piggyback ride.\" And with that, she turned around and knelt for me. I hopped on her back, and we rounded the corner to the stairs. Then I looked back and noticed the Collector’s small body, or at least, what was left of it, still writhing and squirming. Its head had been banged to a pulp. The only thing left was a messy clump of blood and tissue. \n\nBut even with its head obliterated, the demonic creature still quivered and shook like an animal  in the throes of death. Just how hard had she hit that thing? Whoever this mysterious woman was, she definitely wasn’t human. \n\n“Hey, lady?”\n\n“Yes?” she replied. \n\n“Why are you helping me?” \n\nShe smirked.\n\n“Well, I always help my friends,” she replied.\n\n‘When the hell did I become friends with someone like this?’ I wondered. But then I decided to keep the thought to myself. It wouldn’t hurt to have a friend in a place like this. \n\n\"Hey, lady-\"  As soon as my question began, I was interrupted. \n\n\"It's Marianne, and yes?\"\n\n\"Right! Marianne, what are those things?\" My hand shot past her head, pointing out one of the Collectors on a mountaintop in the distance. \n\n\"Oh, those are Collectors.\" She said it so nonchalantly, as though they were a normal sight. \n\n“Okay… So, what are Collectors?”   \n\n“Oh, uhmm…They are small creatures that live in this dimension. They love to keep all the missing things that come to this world to themselves, especially the shiny ones. In a sense, I guess they’re like ravens or magpies but extremely possessive and a bit more violent.” \n\n“In other words, they’ll scratch your eyes out if you try to take any of the stuff here…” I said.\n\n“Exactly; you catch on quick, Miles!” \n\nI couldn’t help but smile. For a moment, I felt as if I was back in school, being verbally rewarded for getting a correct answer. As much as I hated the place and the monotony of it, I yearned for it now. \n\n“So, what is this place?” I asked her.\n\nShe pursed her lips as though she was attempting to piece together an answer that didn’t sound too crazy.\n\n“Well, I can’t say for sure, but my theory is that this is some sort of pocket dimension where some of the things that go missing in your world end up. Why does it exist? And why do some missing things wind up here and others don’t? I don’t know. What I do know is that everything you see here was once held dear by someone… Everything here once belonged to someone who misses it very much,” she explained as we exited the derelict ship and slowly made our way through a narrow, winding path. \n\nHer last words reminded me of my missing Gameboy, and then I wondered whether I would ever get it back.\n\nWe took a lonely path, yet behind the junk and trinkets that towered around us, I could see there were still some Collectors skulking around. But the fact that I had Marianne with me now made me feel a bit more at ease. \n\n“So, since we’re playing twenty-one questions, what else would you like to ask me?” Her words took me off guard. But she was right, I must have had a million questions running through my mind.\n\n\"Uhm… How are you so strong?”  \n\nThis question seemed to make her hesitate momentarily before she slowly answered. \n\n\"I work out… a lot.\"\n\nEven though I was a kid, I could tell that was not the secret behind her strength.\n\n“C’mon, be honest!”\n\nShe gave a cheeky smirk before answering. \n\n“Well, I can only say that this place transforms everything within it to suit its needs. I probably look a lot different in your world than I do here.\n\nWe went through another winding path, it was like a spindly maze of trash and treasure. Of course, I had more questions I wanted to ask, but I wasn’t sure if she’d answer them. \n\n“Do you mind if I ask more questions?”\n\n“Sure, go for it.” She replied. “I can only imagine how confusing all this must seem. I was a little confused too when I got here.” \n\n“Okay, how long have you been here?”\n\nOnce again, there was a pause before she answered. “Hm, well, I can’t say. To be honest, I’ve lost count of the time that’s passed.” \n\nMy eyes widened as I processed her answer. Lost count? That means she’s been here for years, possibly her whole life. Warm drops of sweat dripped down my face as I considered whether the same fate awaited me. \n\n“You're scared, aren’t you?” She asked, as though she could sense my heart drumming faster.\n\n“Just a little nervous, I-I’m fine,” I replied, trying my best to sound fine. \n\n“Don’t worry, I won’t let you get stuck here. I’m going to get you back home, I promise.” \n\nHer words made me feel better. But it also made me wonder about something else. \n\n“What about you? Did you have a home before you got here?” I asked her. She stopped dead in her tracks. A jolt of fear surged through me. \n\n“I’m sorry, was that too personal?”\n\n“No… Be quiet,” she whispered as she took cover behind a pile of junk. Within mere seconds, a few blood-soaked Collectors came scurrying down the road. They were about six or seven in number. Each one clicked and screeched as they sauntered past our hiding spot. I was so scared, I couldn’t move, I couldn’t even breathe. I remained so still that I could feel my heart beating in my chest. One sniffed through the piles like a bloodhound. it was ebbing closer to where we were. Marianne’s muscles tightened. The only noise that could be heard was my heart about to explode, and her fist clenching shut, ready to strike. \n\nSuddenly there was a loud crack in the distance, and all the heads of all the Collectors snapped towards it. Their aggressive clicking sound swirled, and they ran toward the direction of the noise. \n\nAfter a few minutes, we crept out from our hiding spot. \n\n“That was a close call.” Marianne heaved a sigh of relief. \n\n“They were looking for something… They were looking for us.” I said, and Marianne nodded her head. \n\n“Let’s hurry; we can't risk them finding us before we get to where we are going.” She added, a tinge of urgency in her voice. Considering how well she took care of the first Collector, I felt like I was invincible with her around. But at that point, I realized how much danger we were in. Sure, she could handle one, but what if that was a fluke? What would happen if we were caught by a group like the one that had just passed? I shuddered at the thought of it. \n\nMarianne quickened her pace.\n\nMy clammy hands clung to her cold shoulders. Her skin held no warmth. The texture was smooth, too smooth. There were no beads of sweat, spots, wrinkles, or smell. It was off-putting, yet it wasn’t the strangest thing I’d experienced today. \n\n“Hey, Miles, can you close your eyes until I tell you to open them again?” She interrupted my train of thought, but I did as she said. \n\n“Sure, is everything okay?”\n\n“Yeah, everything is fine; just trust me.” \n\n“Okay, I trust you.” I said, catching a glimpse of her smile before I closed my eyes. \n\nWe stopped walking. Then Marianne hushed me, and I remained perfectly still. Not a moment later, I heard the jingling of a bell and soft footsteps. A rancid odor filtered into my nose, like the smell of detergent mixed with death. It was awful, and so pungent that my nose almost refused to take in any more oxygen. \n\nSomeone or something was coming, and the closer it got, the more terrified I became. The soft footsteps stopped, and the odor drifted around. Marianne began to speak. My ears perked up, and I tried to listen in on their conversation, but I didn’t understand her words,\n\nThe strange creature responded in rattles. Its voice creaked like the clattering of chains. I was dying of curiosity, so I peaked just a tiny bit and immediately wished I didn’t. The thing Marianne was speaking to was more horrifying than any fever dream of mine I could conjure up. \n\nIt had the body of a human draped in a tattered brown cloak. But from its neck up, it was a millipede. Its grotty body towered ten feet upwards. Luster gold rings wrapped around each segment of its head. Each column had hundreds of tiny wriggly legs. Long rows of teeth dotted its gaping mouth, there were literally thousands of them. The creature's head craned over Marianne as the both of them spoke. \n\nI gasped in fear. It caught the monster's attention and arched its head toward mine. Its rattling intensified. Marianne noticed that I peeked. \n\n“I told you not to look! Now, look at what you…” Before she could finish talking to me, the monster rattled once again. Marianne immediately replied to it. \n\n“No, he wants to leave, I told you that already! \n\nSome sort of argument took place. I noticed we were in a market, and all kinds of shiny items littered the walls. There were swords, artifacts, necklaces, you name it.\n\n“No way! That’s completely outrageous. You know he needs that!” Marianne yelled.\n\n“Marianne, what… what does he want?” I stuttered.\n\n“It’s not important, I-” While she spoke with me, the creature spoke up again, and Marianne growled back. \n\n“No, especially not his heart!” Marianne finally let out a long sigh and then asked me a question. \n\n“Miles, do you have anything that you brought with you when you came here that’s definitely yours? Something that holds any value to you?” One thing came to mind but was lost in a sea of things. \n\n“Yeah, my Gameboy. But I don’t know where it is…” A heavy gust of air brushed past me, and from the nearest pile, there was a small thud and a clank, then my Gameboy appeared. Marianne scooped it up and handed it to me. \n\n“If we give it to him, we’ll have a chance at getting you home. Are you okay with that?” \n\nBefore she was done speaking, I was already holding the Gameboy out into the open air. It dematerialized from my hand, and I saw it reappear on the shop's back shelves. I’d made up my mind, no price was too steep to go home. \n\nMarianne began to walk off now, leaving the shop far behind us. In the distance where we were heading, the mountains of treasure began to part for us. The path was straightforward. \n\n“Marianne, who was that?”\n\n“His existence predates even this place. He’s a Keeper, and comes here frequently to make trades in exchange for… things? Personally, I think he’s only a bit better than the Collectors. At least he’s willing to talk things over before he takes everything you’ve got. But hey! Now we can get you back. All we need to do is get to the end of this path on top of that pile, and you will be home free. ” She said, pointing to a hole above a pile, far in the sky which had now widened. Bright light flickered from it like an elevator waiting to be boarded. \n\nIt was a clear shot now, and I felt Marianne's hands grip my legs as she whispered under her breath. “Hang on tight.” She ran while carrying me; this couldn’t exactly be called running though. It was like she was flying with each step. My heart was filled with hope, but all that hope was suddenly dashed when I heard clicking noises all around us. It first started as a whisper, then a chatter, then a cacophony of clicking, chirpings, and shrieks. Collectors were pouring out of every space, and every crevice. \n\nThe piles that moved out of our way had Collectors full of them. Marianne was able to vault over the first several, but soon enough, they were growing in number. They were ahead of us and behind now too. \n\n“Hold on!” Marianne cried to me. My chest tightened as I braced for impact. \n\nA small group climbed over each other to try and stop Marianne's mad sprint, but she barged right through them. Our speed decreased substantially. They bit and clawed at her. I could feel Marianne’s legs slowly. Another swarm was already forming to try and grab a hold of her. She dug her arm into a nearby  pile and pulled out a long, rusty crowbar. \n\nShe swung once and caved in the heads of two collectors. One flew towards her, and she flung again, its bones snapped like twigs. Another tried to latch onto her leg, and I stuck my own leg out and gave it a kick. It fell away, taking my left shoe with it. The more we fought off, however, the more that came. Then the unthinkable happened, the crowbar that Marianne had been swinging snapped in half. \n\nMarianne was no longer sprinting, nor jogging even. Instead, it was a slow walk; any Collector approaching us was promptly met with her fist in their face. The disgusting creatures howled and cackled even louder as they sensed they were getting the upper hand. More of them poured in, one latched onto her leg, and we fell. I rolled onto the floor, and a collector quickly pounced on me, scratching and clawing. My right hand grazed a hammer. I stretched further and grabbed it. Then I buried it right into the Collector’s temple. It fell off me and began to writhe in pain. \n\nDroves attacked Marianne, and she fought them off as much as she could. As the last of the Collectors fell, I swear I heard something crack. Marianne stopped moving.\n\n“Marianne, are you okay?” \n\n“Yes Miles.” She said with a cracked smile. “All you have to do is make it to the end, and you can go home. Don’t look back, I’ll keep them away from you, so just run when I give you the signal.” \n\n“No, I’m not leaving you here!” I cried. Tears trickled down my eyes. \n\n“I need you to be brave, Miles. Your folks are waiting for you at home.” Our reprieve ended as another wave of Collectors began to charge us. \n\n“Now!” Marianne shouted.\n\nI hobbled towards the exit. I could see the light twinkling from a distance. It was a rough landing. My entire body felt bruised, but I was ahead of the pack for now. My legs carried me like my life depended on it. No, my life did depend on it. Just another 50 meters, I saw it. It was as if someone cropped a piece of reality out. That was my way home. I turned to check on Marianne but slowed down for a moment. Something grabbed hold of my ankle, and I staggered forward. I tried to pull my leg forward, but it didn’t budge. The small, root-like fingertips held my leg firmly in place. My legs kicked at it with all my might, and I was freed.\n\nThat freedom didn’t last for long. As I pushed myself to my feet again, something threw its  weight on me, and I collapsed under them. It was so heavy I thought I would suffocate. I tried to crawl forward, I tried to claw at the ground, to dig myself away, but nothing happened. Then I remembered the hammer I picked up. My hammer, where was it? My eyes darted feverishly, and I noticed it lying on the ground a few feet away. I must have dropped it during the chase. \n\nBut just when I thought all hope was lost, someone struck the Collector from behind, shattering its malformed skull. I looked up to see Marianne standing before me with her arm stretched out. Just as she did on the ship, only now her dress was tattered. Her right hand and left leg were missing. There were cracks all over her body, yet, there was no blood. I fought back the tears as I saw how much damage she had received for my sake. \n\n“It’s okay, Miles. I don’t feel any pain.” She said as she pulled me to my feet. “Besides, I thought I already told you. I always help my friends.” She winked at me. \n\n“Almost there. Just a few more steps,” she said, but as sure as the sunsets, there came another horde. \n\n“Quick, Miles, through the portal, now!” She yelled as she jammed her fist into one but more pounced on her. I had left her before, but I wasn’t going to do it again. I briskly looked around me for something I could distract them with. My eyes fell on a bag. I quickly rummaged through it, and inside I found a flare gun. Pointing the gun away from us, I squeezed the trigger, and a bright light shot out from it. It flew through the air like a shooting star and then landed on a faraway pile. \n\nThe remaining Collectors turned their heads towards it. Then, within a few seconds, they left us and went after the burning flare. \n\nI toddled to Marianne’s side. Her face had cracked open, and a hole was in it. A portion of her outer thigh was also missing. Behind her was a trail of Collectors corpses. \n\nI stuck my arms underneath hers and walked backward, dragging her along all the while. I know she said not to bring anything home with me, but this was an exception, right? When I reached the portal, she was actually much easier to carry now. The portal’s warm light caressed my worn, tired face, and in an instant, I was whisked away.\n\nOriginally, I’m from Nebraska, so it would definitely be a surprise to know that I came out in a dumpster behind a Chuck E Cheese store in San Antonio, Texas. I looked at my hand, the one I pulled Marianne with, and I found a doll. A broken doll, no bigger than my fist. It didn’t take me long to figure out that the doll was Marianne. \n\nI was swiftly taken to a hospital and reunited with my parents. I’ve never been able to fully explain to my parents or anyone else what exactly happened to me. They assumed it was a strange abduction. My parents were particularly concerned about why I kept Marianne with me. It was strange, especially for a boy my age. \n\nI didn’t care though. Every allowance I saved up my money and I paid to have her fixed up. It was difficult to find someone who was willing to work on a doll that was missing whole appendages, but thankfully I found someone that was confident in getting her back to a good state of being. I didn’t let her out of my sight. She was always kept close to me, and was sure never to misplace her. \n\nEighteen years have passed since that fateful day, but the scars it left on me has yet to heal. I don’t misplace anything now, I’m too afraid to. I itemize and label all my things. I even put cameras all over my house to ensure everything is where I left it. My eight-year-old daughter Mari thinks I’m obsessive-compulsive, which is not far from the truth. I’d never told her what had happened that day. Neither have I told her why Marianne is encased in plexiglass at the corner of her room. \n\nI had hoped she would spend the rest of her life thinking her dad was a weirdo instead of learning a single thing about the Lost and Found. I’m writing this as a warning to you, the reader. If you ever find yourself lost in the lost and found, then hope and pray that you have a friend there for you. \n\n“Daddy!” My daughter’s voice boomed from upstairs, and my blood immediately froze solid. Her scream echoed through the entire house. I had a gut feeling that something had gone wrong. I bounded up the stairs to my daughter’s room. \n\n“Mari?! What is it!?” I called out as I burst through the door of her room. A lump formed in my throat, and my eyes widened as I realized what had happened. \n\nMari’s left shoe lay eerily still next to a pit of darkness swirling underneath her bed. \n\n“Mari! Mari!” I cried until my voice was hoarse. \n\n“Daddy, help me!” Her faint voice rang back. It echoed from within the hole. Without another word, I reached for Marianne’s case and held it tightly. Then I stared down the hole. I knew what I needed to do. \n\n“Marianne, I’m sorry, but I need your help again… They took my shiny.”\n\nMy hand fumbled the key around my neck as the case clicked open. I withdrew Marianne from the case and held her close. My eyes wandered back to the hole in the floor. I knew it would be sometime before it closed. I couldn’t tell you how I know, it’s just a feeling. \n\nI made my way downstairs, and gathered my belongings. A survival backpack full of rations, a machete, a hunting knife, a collection of glowsticks, flashlights, and last but not least, a flare gun. I couldn’t risk a real gun because of the noise, but this is even better. \n\nI make my way back up the stairs, and look down at my phone one final time before I push the bed aside, and I sit down, my legs dangling over the precipice. Marianne and I fall into the darkness, and I click post.",

        "text": "Hundred year flood.  That’s what started it all.  It was long before I was born.  My dad was a kid when it happened.  They lost their house.  He doesn’t remember much - grandma and grandpa sent him to stay with some friends that were up on higher ground when the rain kept coming and coming.  He has vague memories of being bored out of his mind and the adults coming and going, talking to each other in hushed voices.  He remembers the woman - grandma’s friend - cooking for what felt like all day, saying that the food was going to the churches and the community center and everywhere else that people were staying who had lost their homes.\n\nThen grandma and grandpa came back for him and he found out there was no home to go back to.\n\nThey lived in a rental for a bit over a year in the next town over.  It was a hard year, he said, as he was going to a different school and didn’t know anyone.  But they were lucky.  They got a new house and moved back.  Lots of families that went away just… never returned.  The town shrank after the flood and while the population eventually recovered as new families moved in, it lost a lot of the people that remembered what happened.\n\nGrandma died seven years ago.  Grandpa died five years ago.  And dad - well, he was only a kid.  Mom certainly doesn’t remember anything because she isn’t from here.  They met in college and when he wanted to move back home to be close to his family, she agreed.  She certainly didn’t want to be near *her* family.  I still haven’t met my maternal grandparents.  Don’t even know if they’re still alive.  Mom doesn’t talk about it.\n\nI didn’t particularly want to come back here.  It’s a small town and there’s not a lot going on around it.  Just flat, open fields of corn and soybeans.  The river, of course, but it's not very exciting either.  Every bit as flat as the terrain around it, meandering back and forth in gentle curves until it passes through the center of town.  People go kayaking on it in the summer, but that’s the extent of its relevance to the town.  Other than the flood, of course.  The hundred year flood that barely anyone remembers.\n\nThis was more a town for established families.  Young couples ready to settle down and have their first child and maybe a few more.  People like my parents who had roots here and were looking towards retirement.  It wasn’t the place for someone fresh out of college and wanting to start a career.  But when dad got his diagnosis I had to reconsider what my priorities were.  He protested, of course, but I knew how to spin it.  It wouldn’t be that long, I said.  Half a year.  Plenty of people take a short break after college to go on some dream trip or something before finding a job.  I wasn’t flying overseas to backpack across Europe or anything exciting like that, I said, but it would still be like a vacation.  A staycation.  A staycation at my parent’s house in my old bedroom with the occasional trip to the hospital for dad’s chemotherapy appointments.\n\nNone of us were particularly *afraid*.  The oncologist had said ‘curable.’  Not ‘treatable.’  *Curable*.  It’s an important difference.  So we would go to the appointments and this was going to be hard but it was just one small part of our lives and we’d get through it and everything would keep going after that.  That’s what I told myself.  This was just a pause.\n\nStill, it felt weird to be moving my belongings back into my old bedroom.  I was going to move to Seattle.  I’d already picked out a couple of rentals I could afford for a few months while I searched for a job.  They weren’t in the city, but they were close enough and I could always move to someplace nicer once I was more stable.  Instead, I found myself standing on the creaky wooden floor of my old bedroom, staring at the narrow twin bed I’d spent most of my life sleeping in.  My parents had started using the bedroom as storage and half of the room was lined with boxes that used to be in the basement.  Dad didn’t like keeping things in the basement, not after losing everything he ever owned in the flood as a child.\n\n“We can move those back,” my mom said apologetically as I surveyed the mess.\n\n“I’ll move them,” I said.  “It’s not a big deal.”\n\n“Don’t you need to be looking for jobs though?”\n\n“That’s not going to take all day.  I’m going to put in like three hours worth of submitting applications and then the rest of the time is going to be spent helping out around here, okay?”\n\nShe thinned her lips like she did when she wasn’t happy but didn’t think it was worth disagreeing.  I’d long since grown immune to feeling any guilt when this happened.  This was what I wanted to do and I was going to do it.\n\n“I don’t want the boxes in the basement.”\n\nMy father materialized behind her in the doorway.  He hadn’t started chemo yet, but he was already wearing a blue surgical mask.  He didn’t want anything getting in the way of his treatment.  I’d need to start wearing one soon as well, I thought.  \n\n“I’ll move them back out when I leave,” I promised.\n\n“Have you looked at the weather?  It’s going to rain all next week.  This house shouldn’t even have a basement.  None of the houses around here should have basements.”\n\n“They have basements because of the tornado risk,” my mom sighed.\n\nThis was an old argument.  My dad seemed to be picking a lot of fights over the same things again and again lately.  I suspected it served as a distraction from the cancer.\n\n“When’s the last time we had a tornado around here?” he asked.\n\nBut he was already walking off down the hallway.  My mom’s voice drifted after him as she followed him, leaving me to do what I wanted with the boxes and to get my own things unpacked.\n\n“When’s the last time we had a flood?” I muttered, hefting the first of the boxes.\n\nI swear, they were all full of dishware and probably weighed 50 lbs each.  I lugged them back to a vacant corner of the basement that I assumed used to be where they resided.  There was an odd smell down there that took me a while to place.  At first I thought it was mold and I searched the corners and walls and turned the flashlight on my phone and carefully examined the ceiling.  There wasn’t a drop of moisture that I could find, which was a relief.  The last thing my parents needed to be dealing with right now on top of dad’s diagnosis was water damage.\n\nWith the last box downstairs, I paused to take a couple deep breaths in one last attempt to identify the smell.  It wasn’t musty, I thought.  No mold or mildew.  It reminded me of the outdoors, but not quite like a summer day or being in a forested area.  Something else.\n\nIt struck me as I went upstairs.  Hay, I thought.  It smelled like hay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn’t think much about it.  Not until almost a week later, after dad’s first chemotherapy appointment.  It was later in the day and mom and I were taking care of the evening chores. All that was left was running the trash out to the bin.  Mom had already taken the trash out to the curb, but the kitchen trash had filled up since then, and she didn’t want dad to try to take it out because it was raining.  It’d been raining since yesterday.  Just a steady rain, the kind that saturated the ground and backed up storm drains.  It should stop sometime in the night, according to the forecast.  I put on a jacket and headed outside.\n\nSunset had come early on account of the overhead clouds, but it wasn’t dark enough for the street lights to come on yet.  There was a foul smell in the air, lingering over the scent of damp earth, and I wrinkled my nose.  Surely it wasn’t the trash.  I lifted the lid of the bin, tossed the bag in, and then saw the source of it a short distance away.\n\nPoop.  There was poop on the sidewalk.  A big pile of it.  Some animal had come by and pooped in front of our house.\n\n“Gross,” I muttered.\n\nAt least the rain would wash it away.\n\nDad was waiting in the entryway when I came back in.  He shuffled over and reached for my jacket, so I turned around to let him take it off and put it away.  Even cancer-stricken, he wanted to be a gentleman sometimes.\n\n“Mom didn’t like it when I went out in the rain,” he said, shaking the water off my jacket.  “She’d get real upset and tell me I wasn’t allowed out.”\n\n“Did she not want you getting wet or something?” I asked.  \n\n“No, I mean she’d be *really* upset.”  He frowned.  “Sometimes she’d cry.”\n\nThat startled me.  Grandma always seemed very grounded to me.  Like a mountain that could weather anything.  She was resilient.  She didn’t get angry very often and when she did, it was more a quiet disappointment that felt even worse than being screamed at.  I’d never experienced it, thank goodness.  But crying?  I couldn’t imagine my grandmother crying.\n\n“Well, someone is out in the rain,” I said grouchily.  “They let their dog poop on your sidewalk.”\n\nMy dad suddenly came to life.  He tapped into that energy that the chemotherapy hadn’t begun to erode yet.\n\n“I know who that is!” he exclaimed.  “Here - let me get a paper bag.  We’ll scoop it up and leave it on their front porch.”\n\n“No you won’t!”\n\nMy mother’s voice came from somewhere upstairs.  Clearly I’d found another one of their long-standing disagreements.  But dad was already rummaging in the pantry.\n\n“It’s probably nice and soggy too,” he said gleefully.  “I hope the bag falls apart when they pick it up and it falls on their foot.  I don’t understand why they can’t just pick it up like they’re supposed to.  Their dog isn’t even that big.”\n\nWell at least this gave me a way to head dad off from his plan of petty revenge.\n\n“I don't think it’s them, if it’s a small dog,” I said.  “It was… huge.  Like.  It looks like horse poop, honestly.”\n\nHe paused.  He’d found the paper bags, unfortunately.  I had to talk him out of this quickly.\n\n“No horses around here anymore,” he finally said.  “Had to be a dog.  Not sure who owns a dog that big.”\n\n“It’s fine, the rain will wash it away,” I said.  “Besides, mom doesn’t want you going out in the rain.”\n\nShe was still yelling from upstairs.  Neither of us were really listening to her at this point, but I think that was the gist of what she was saying.  Dad sighed and put the bags back.\n\n“Okay, but if you see them letting their dog poop out there,” he said, “do me a favor and throw it back onto their front porch, okay?”\n\nI lied and said I would.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was starting to hate the boxes in the basement.  Dad was growing increasingly more obsessed with them.  It was the chemo, mom said.  It was stressful and he didn’t feel well and he was finding other things to be concerned about.  It wasn’t logical, but none of what was happening to our family made sense anymore.  We just had to get through it and in the meantime, if it made dad feel better to do something about the basement, then we’d just go along with it.  She’d rent a storage unit if she had to, if that made him stop fretting about it.\n\nShe was afraid he’d go down there and start unpacking them himself.  I was afraid of the same thing.  The last thing I wanted was my cancer-stricken father carrying 50 lbs of plates and bowls up and down the stairs.  So after I finished sending out some job applications and scheduling interviews from the few replies I’d gotten, I went down into the basement with a box knife to see what was inside them.\n\nAs expected, there were a lot of plates.  I set most of them aside in a ‘to get rid of’ pile.  There was a green-tinted glass serving platter that I set aside to check if it was some kind of vintage or antique that might be worth saving.  Then, three boxes of dishware down, I got to the photo albums.\n\nThey weren’t in great shape.  The plastic cover for each page had fused with the faint layer of glue.  I flipped through a handful of them, seeing photos of my birthday parties and my first ballet recital.  They appeared to be in chronological order so I dug deeper, curious to see how far back they went.  The photos grew steadily more washed out, the colors fading and finally turning into sepia tones.  I finally paused on a page containing photos of my grandmother as a much younger woman, her hair dark and curly, holding a toddler on her knee.  I eased the plastic off the page and pried the photo off with the tip of the knife.  I checked the back.  My dad was a little obsessive with writing dates on things and sure enough, I found his handwriting on the back with a year.  He would have been three in this photo, by my math.\n\nI took the album upstairs with me and found mom.  \n\n“We need to do something about these,” I said, flipping it open.  “Look.  The page protectors are starting to break down and I’m worried they’ll damage the photos.”\n\n“Oh.  Yeah, we should store them in something else.  How many did you find?”\n\n“Lots.”\n\nShe took the photo of grandma when I handed it to her.\n\n“Who is that lady behind the couch?” I asked.\n\nShe was leaning over the back, smiling broadly and staring at my dad.  Her hair was chestnut in color, short and curly.\n\n“I’m not sure.  Why don’t you ask your dad?  He might be awake.”\n\nI took the photo upstairs with me.  I put on one of the surgical masks we left hanging on the doorknob to dad’s bedroom before pushing the door open.  They’d turned the office into an additional bedroom, putting a bed in there before I showed up so dad could isolate when he wasn’t feeling well or sleep without being disturbed by anyone else in the family.  He was indeed awake, sitting propped up in bed and listlessly watching something on the TV.  He looked inhumanely pale in the lurid glare of the screen and I averted my eyes.\n\nI didn’t like seeing him like that.\n\n“I found this photo in the basement,” I said.  “Can I turn the lights on?”\n\nHe nodded, not really taking his eyes off the TV.  I flipped the switch and walked over, sitting down on the chair next to the bed.  Just a few more months, I thought.  A few more months and he’d be done with this.\n\n“Who is this?” I asked.\n\nI pointed at the woman in the photo.  He took the photo from me and stared at her for a long time.\n\n“I think that’s my aunt,” he finally said.  “I don’t remember her that well.  She died when I was young.”\n\nHe lay his hand back down on the bed.  I waited a few minutes as he stared at the TV, waiting to see if he’d remember anything else.  Then I noticed the steady rise and fall of his chest.  He’d fallen asleep again.  Probably for the best.  I quietly took the photo, turned out the lights, and left him to sleep.\n\nAfter that, I started setting aside photos of her when I found them.  I didn’t know my dad had an aunt.  It was understandable that he didn’t talk much about her, if he didn’t remember her that well, and if she’d died young then it was likely grandma didn’t want to bring it up.  Still, she fascinated me.  She always looked so happy in the photos.  I found a couple of her with horses, leading them by the reins with my dad in the saddle.  I asked him if he remembered the horses and he didn’t, but he said there used to be a horse farm not far from where they lived.  I drove by there one afternoon to see if I could see the horses or maybe recognize the big oak tree in the background of some of the photos.  Instead, I found some empty posts where a sign might have once been, a gate, and ‘no trespassing’ signs.\n\n“Oh yeah, the farm shut down,” dad said when I told him about it.  “They sold that property long ago and the people that own it now aren’t that friendly.  Dad told me as a kid I wasn’t allowed to go over there and I’d be grounded for life if I did.”\n\nGrandpa wasn’t mean.  My dad was just… *a handful* as a child, as I understood it.  \n\nThe threat hadn’t stopped my dad.  He’d gone there anyway and hopped the fence and looked around.  He’d found the horse barn, but it had collapsed by then, and was nothing more than sagging walls and a flattened roof.  The entire thing had smelled of rotting hay.  He hadn’t gone back after that.  There wasn’t much to see.  Just an empty field and a dilapidated building.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that it began to rain in earnest.  We were halfway through dad’s treatment.  He slept a lot and when he was awake, he told long, rambling stories from his childhood.  I thought it was the rain that was doing it.  It seemed to make him remember his mom and her dire warnings to stay inside.  He mentioned it often, shaking his head and saying it was the only time she was ever really strict with him.  No going outside, he said.  That was her thing.\n\nThe flood must have been traumatic for them, I thought.\n\nIt was starting to look like it might flood again.  I didn’t walk down to the bridge anymore, but when we drove past I saw the city had erected barriers.  It was getting close to the bottom of the bridge.  Mom didn’t say anything about it, but I saw her glancing nervously at it.  I don’t think dad noticed at all.  He was usually trying not to throw up on the way back from chemo.\n\nAfter about three days of constant downpour, the rain stopped.  Its absence was so stark that it woke me up in the night.  For a moment I was disoriented by the uncanny silence until I realized that I could no longer hear the raindrops beating against my window.  I lay wide awake in my bed, listening to the quiet outside and the beating of my own heart.  Then the night was punctured by a shrill noise, distant and unfamiliar.  Some kind of animal, I thought.  Maybe a coyote.  There were plenty of those around here.  Then another cry, and another right after it.  I sat up in bed.\n\nMaybe it wasn’t as far away as it sounded, I thought.  I could feel my breathing and heart speeding up, some instinctual part of my body growing alarmed at the noise.  It was fine, I told myself.  I was inside.  It was nothing.  I took a deep breath.\n\nIn fact, I thought, it might just be the TV.  Dad had taken to falling asleep with it on.  Mom sometimes turned it off during the night, but I always slept through it.  I got out of bed, trying to walk softly so that the floor wouldn’t creak, and entered the hallway.  I crept into dad’s room, putting on my mask first to be safe.  The TV was on and I couldn’t see much in the sudden glare, my eyes slow to adjust.  I fumbled around for the remote and turned the power off.\n\nThe screams continued.  That’s what they were, I realized.  Some kind of animal screaming.\n\nIt wasn’t coming from the TV, either.\n\nAnd dad wasn’t asleep in his bed.  It was empty.\n\nAnxiously, I hurried from the room.  I glanced into the master bedroom where my mom was still asleep before I descended the stairs.  The cries were louder now.  They were growing closer.\n\nI found dad in the entryway.  He was looking outside through the windows to either side of the front door.  I came over to stand next to him, looking outside at the street.  There was a haze in the air, thick coils of fog wrapping around the nearby houses and turning them into hunkered shadows in the night, indistinct and ominous.\n\n“Mom always said I couldn’t go out when it rained,” he whispered.  “Honestly, I didn’t want to go out there.  Not when it rained like this.”\n\n“Because of the flood?” I ventured.\n\n“I remember screaming,” he said faintly.  “There was always screaming when it rained.  Only I heard it.”\n\nThere was a current of water in the street.  It lapped at the edges of the curb, roiling past the tires of parked cars, and continued on and out of sight.  Like the river, I thought.  It reminded me of the river.\n\nThen it started to rain again, returning in a violent curtain of water, and the cries were drowned out in the thunderous downpour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt began to feel like dad was made of glass.  He wore layers because he was cold and it was like the clothing swallowed him up.  It felt like he’d shatter at any moment and all those shirts and jackets were just padding so nothing could hurt him.  Mom and I worried a lot, in quiet, when he wasn’t within earshot.  She marked the days off on the calendar, counting down until he was done with his chemotherapy.  We were over halfway done, she’d say.  Almost there.\n\nThen one evening, I called for dad to come down for dinner and he didn’t.  After about ten minutes of waiting, I went up to check on him, thinking that maybe his TV was up too loud.  He wasn’t really watching anything he enjoyed most of the time.  It was just something to keep himself distracted.\n\nBut he wasn’t in his room.  I went back down and told mom, who sighed dramatically and asked if I’d check the basement.  Maybe he was obsessing over those boxes again, she said.  He’d better not be trying to lift them.  With that grim warning hanging over my head, I headed down into the basement, hoping he wouldn’t be down there.  I didn’t want to be around that particular argument between them.\n\nThe smell of hay hit me when I stepped off the stairs.  It was almost overwhelming.  This time, it smelled musty, with a faint hint of mildew.  I felt sick inhaling it.  I navigated around the shelves and stacks of boxes, looking for either my dad or some evidence of a leak.  Dad wasn’t down here, but I took my time inspecting the walls.  We had been getting a lot of rain lately and I didn’t want to overlook any problems.\n\nI’d just finished a lap of the basement when I paused by the windows.  They were narrow slits at the top of the wall, just barely above the ground level on the outside of the house.  Very little light came in through them with the storm clouds overhead, but it was making strange patterns on the ground.  I stared at it for a second, watching as the faint traces of remote sunlight swayed across my shoes.\n\nLike I was underwater.\n\nStartled, I jerked my gaze up to the window.\n\nWater.  There was water covering them.\n\nI ran up the stairs.  I didn’t say anything to mom, I just ran out through the back door and to the side of the house.  The grass squished and gave under my feet, but when I rounded the corner, I didn’t see any standing water.  The windows were fine.  The ground was saturated, but we weren’t flooding.  Not yet.\n\n“Is everything okay?” mom asked when I came back in.\n\n“Yeah, I thought I saw something outside,” I replied as I wiped my feet dry.\n\nWhat *had* I seen?  I wasn’t sure anymore.\n\n“I looked in the garage,” mom said.  “The car is gone.”\n\nDad had left the house.  There was no reason he couldn’t obviously, he was a grown man.  And sure, he was exhausted all the time, but that was the chemo and if he felt strong enough to run an errand then why shouldn’t he?  I saw the worry in mom’s face, though.  He hadn’t told any of us.  He’d been acting a little erratically since the cancer treatments had started.\n\nI gave up on drying my shoes and went to the hallway to get my jacket.\n\n“I’ll go see if I can find him,” I offered.  “Call me if he comes home.”\n\nI checked the grocery store.  The nearby gas station.  I went to the dollar store.  I checked every place I thought that someone bored and anxious for a quick change of scenery might visit. Nothing. There weren’t many cars in the parking lots, on account of the weather, and their car wasn’t among them.  Then I had a thought.  I called mom and asked what the address to dad’s childhood home had been.  He’d been reminiscing a lot, I said, and perhaps he’d gone there.\n\nI had to drive slowly, for there was standing water in the road leading to the old house.  The neighborhood was sorely neglected.  There were some houses, but most of them were vacant and had signs attached to the doors indicating they were condemned.  This area had never recovered from the flood and no one was trying to rebuild it.  It’d been abandoned.  I felt that was understandable, considering how badly the road was flooding already.  I eased the car up out of the water and into the crumbling driveway.  Dad’s car was there.  And dad was standing at the edge of the driveway, staring at the concrete foundation that was all that remained of his childhood home.\n\nHe looked so small in the rain.  Like a sand castle being slowly washed away.  I felt like if I waited too long, he’d simply dissolve and drift away in the run-off.\n\nI got out of the car and walked over with an umbrella.  He was shivering underneath his raincoat.  Had my dad always been this thin?  Had I just not noticed the chemotherapy eating him away in tiny slivers?\n\n“Mom is worried,” I said, standing next to him, staring at the empty plot of dirt and young trees that were slowly reclaiming where his house had once stood.  They swam in growing puddles of standing water.\n\n“Sorry,” he said.  “I just had a sudden idea to come out here.  I’ve been thinking about death a lot.”\n\n“You’re not going to die,” I said firmly.\n\n“I know.  Only one month left.  But I don’t know, something like this… it just makes you think about it.”\n\nBut why here?  Why the old house?  I licked my lips nervously.\n\n“What happened to your aunt?” I asked.\n\n“She drowned.  Dad told me when I was in college.”\n\n“During the flood?”\n\n“During the flood.”\n\nShe was helping his parents get some things from the house before it completely flooded, he said.  They weren’t able to save a lot because the water was rising too fast and they were afraid of being trapped inside.  So they’d given up after only a few trips and were about to leave when his aunt had heard something.\n\nThe horses.  They were still in their barn and the river was consuming the pastures.\n\nHis aunt went to free them.  And perhaps she succeeded, he said, for they found her body some distance from the horse barn.  They’d made it out of the pasures, even.  But at some point, they’d possibly been cut off, and his aunt had been swept away and drowned.  They found her body caught on a tree when the waters receded.  They never found the bodies of the horses.\n\n“We should go home,” I said.  “Mom is keeping dinner warm.”\n\n“I’m not hungry anymore.”\n\n“I know.”\n\nI didn’t know what else to say, so I hugged his shoulders and we stood there for a bit until he began to shiver.  Then he reluctantly went back to his car, saying he’d better at least try to eat or mom would be sad.  I waited a moment, glancing back over the remains of his home one last time, and then followed in my own car.\n\nHe was thinking about death.  I understood - logically - why, but it still bothered me.  All I wanted to think about was his last day of treatment and when this would all be over.  It was like our entire lives had been put on pause and I was holding my breath and waiting for everything to start moving again.\n\nI glanced at the vacant houses as we drove slowly past them.  Like driving through a cemetery of lives uprooted, I thought.  Little wonder dad came here if he was in a morbid mood.\n\nThen I slammed on the brakes.\n\nSomeone was staring at me through one of the windows.  The condemned notification fluttered on the door, the ink faded into near illegibility.\n\nA pale face with dark hair.  I couldn’t make out anything else through the rain.\n\nThen I saw dad’s brakelights up ahead as he stopped to wait for me.  I glanced at them, then glanced back at the building.  \n\nThe face was gone.  I kept driving.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe had a few weeks of sunshine and dad’s chemotherapy progressed.  It was a small town, but it was still big enough to have its own hospital, not far from downtown.  They only allowed one person back with the patient, so mom would go with dad and I’d take a walk.  The hospital was close to main street that stretched all the way through downtown.  A bridge went over the river and I’d walk down there, watch the water for a little bit, and then walk back.  I began to notice that even with the sunshine, the river wasn’t receding.  It was still raining upstream, one of the locals commented one day, when we were both staring over the edge of the bridge and into the water.  He hadn’t seen it this high in a long time.\n\nHe was older than my dad, so I asked him about the flood.\n\n“Lot of people lost their houses,” he said, sucking his teeth.  “Then there was that business with the horses.”\n\n“I think that was my great aunt,” I said.\n\n“Oh!”  He looked at me closer.  “I remember you now.  Didn’t recognize you all grown up.”\n\nI had no idea who this man was but clearly he remembered me as a child.  It was an uncomfortable feeling and I concentrated on the river instead, watching the water churn as it passed beneath the bridge.\n\n“They say you can see them,” he said.  “Look.”\n\nHe pointed at the water, where it turned into a white froth at the bridge supports.  I squinted, unsure of what I was looking at.\n\nSomething dark.  Something dark in the water.  Then a hard edge broke the water’s surface and I saw a black, vacant hole like an eye and the ivory of bone.  A flash of teeth and a distant, shrill sound, like the wind or like a scream from a rotting throat.  I thought of my dad, swallowing his soup, his skin stretched tight like plastic wrap over his esophagus.  Then the creature vanished beneath the water again.\n\n“They’ve come back,” the man said.  “It’s going to flood again.  Just you wait and see.  And tell your parents I said ‘hi’.”\n\nThen he walked off and I didn’t want to call after him and ask who the hell he was.  I just wanted to leave.  \n\nI stopped walking past the bridge after that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the old man had predicted, it started raining again.  And it began to flood.  We saw on the news that the river had overflowed the bridge and they were asking people to evacuate the downtown area.  Dad grumbled about the basement and I silently went to carry the remaining boxes upstairs without really knowing where to put them.  Whatever made him feel better, because mom’s assurances that this house was well out of the flood zone wasn’t doing much to calm him.\n\nA hundred year flood.  We were in a hundred year flood.\n\nThere wasn’t a lot we could do but wait.  We still had to make it to dad’s chemotherapy appointments, but we couldn’t take the bridge through downtown anymore.  We had to drive around instead, out to the highway and then back.  It took an hour and on the way back dad would groan and turn a sickly green color as he struggled with nausea for the duration of the long drive.  I didn’t have anywhere to take walks now, so I sat in the waiting room with my mask on.  I could stay with dad for a little bit, while they got him ready, but then when they took him back I’d have to leave.  That was how I was there the day they couldn’t find his vein and kept trying and trying.  I saw the blood spots spreading underneath his skin and then when they finally got the IV in, I quietly excused myself, telling my dad cheerfully that I’d see him when he was done.\n\nI started crying as soon as I left.  I couldn’t stay here, I thought desperately.  I couldn’t just *sit* here and cry and think about how the chemo was eating up my dad and we could only hope it killed the cancer faster than it killed him.  So I left.  I left the hospital and started walking.\n\nIt was drizzling, but not heavy enough that I needed an umbrella.  I walked down main street to the edge of the flood.  The surface of the water was placid, moving sluggishly among the buildings.  Like a giant puddle, I thought.  Just a giant puddle, like the kind I’d splash around in when I was a kid.\n\nThe water was to my ankles before I realized that my body was still moving.  I paused, confused, staring down at my shoes that were barely visible beneath the murky water.  What was I doing, standing here like this?\n\nThen I looked up and there he was.  Dad.  My heart skipped a beat.  His back was to me and he was walking into the water.  I hurriedly waded after him, the floodwater growing deeper with every step.  It splashed noisily around my knees and I called to him, yelling that he needed to go back, that the nurses were probably wondering where he’d gone.  That it was okay, that he’d finish his chemo and everything would go back to normal and we’d all just move on from this long, horrible nightmare.\n\nBut he kept walking.  And I kept going, until the water was up to my waist.  Only then did I pause and so did he.  He stood there and it was like his body was the same color as the water, his dark and curly hair the only bright spot on its muddy surface.\n\nIt was like I was in a dream and I couldn’t wake up.  This didn’t seem right.  His hair.  His dark and curly hair.  The chemo had taken his hair already.  He was bald now.\n\nThis wasn’t my dad.  My dad was back at the hospital with an IV pumping medicine into his body.\n\nThey turned to look at me.  Their hair was the same color as my dad’s had been and it was curly like his, but it was a woman and her skin was flush with color and the chemotherapy hadn’t eaten away at her cheeks and left her as nothing but a bundle of bones.\n\nShe looked frightened.  The water was at her chest.  I reached out my hand to her, opening my mouth to call to her and tell her to come towards me, but nothing came out.  Then the water turned turbulent around her, the tops forming white peaks, and her entire body jerked to one side.  She toppled, into the water, and vanished beneath its murky surface.\n\nIt was like the dream was broken. I screamed.  I waded into the water, thrashing desperately towards where she’d been.  It was past my waist now.  My heart was pounding.  I couldn’t go further.  I might get swept away too.  But where was she?  Where had she gotten swept away to?\n\nThen something hit my legs.  Something large.  My knees crumpled and I went backwards into the water.\n\nI righted myself just as quickly as I’d fallen, getting my head above water, but the current had quickly carried me deeper into the river’s grasp.  I couldn’t find the ground beneath me anymore.  I flailed, trying to grab hold of something - anything - as I struggled to find the ground with my toes.  I could feel the tips of my shoes scraping pavement.  I just wasn’t quite tall enough.\n\nInexorably, the water drew me towards the center of the river and the churning current that overwhelmed the bridge.  Where I’d seen entire trees being dragged down underneath the water the day prior on the news.\n\nFrantically, I tried to swim, tried to direct myself in a different direction.  I was so small though, so small and weak against the water’s pull.  It felt like I couldn’t breathe and I thought that this couldn’t be happening, that I couldn’t drown when we were so close to being *done* with all of this, when we were so close to finishing his treatment and slipping through death’s fingers and escaping.\n\nBut the river was in control now and my arms and legs were burning with exertion.  I could barely keep my head above the surface of the churning water.\n\nThen my hands touched something.  Something solid.  I grasped at it, found that it was broad, and I threw my arm around it.\n\nIt surged up, breaking through the surface of the water next to me.\n\nA horse.  My arm was wrapped around the neck of a horse.\n\nIt rolled its head to look at me and I expected to see eyes wild with terror, lips peeled back in its frenzy.  I stared instead into empty eye sockets, the flesh peeling back from the bone in shades of gray and green.  Tiny holes dotted its sagging cheeks, little pinpricks where worms burrowed their tunnels into its decaying muscle.  Its teeth were bared because the lips had long ago sloughed off.  And where my arm touched it, where my fingers dug into its neck in a desperate attempt to find something solid to cling to, the flesh *gave*.  I felt cold liquid spilling out from where the skin tore open, as cold as the water around me.\n\nThe water churned all around me. More heads broke the surface, their manes falling out, their ears missing, and their empty eye sockets turning towards the sky and the rain falling overhead.  They clustered tight around me, their bodies bumping into mine, and their legs thrashed at the water, desperately trying to keep their heads aloft.\n\nThe herd, I realized.  The herd that drowned.  They were still trying to escape the flood waters.\n\nI heard the noise of an engine from somewhere behind me.  I twisted, still holding tight to the horse’s neck.  Two inflatable boats were heading towards me.  I raised an arm and waved at them, yelling, and one of the men in a bright life vest waved back.  They saw me.  They were coming.\n\nThe horses sank below the waters just before they reached me.  I watched their skulls vanish into the water, I felt the firm pressure of one of them as it slipped underneath me, putting its back under my feet, and with one last push it shoved me up out of the flood and into the boat.  My great-aunt had tried to save them, so long ago, and now they were trying to save me.\n\nHands grabbed my arms and shirt and they heaved me the rest of the way in and I sat there in a soaking, shaking heap among the rescue team.\n\n“There was a woman,” I cried.  “She was in the water so I was trying to get to her and bring her back, but she got pulled under.  I was trying to reach her when I lost my footing.”\n\nOne of the men spoke into a radio.  The other boat broke off and began piloting downriver, following the current and the direction I pointed in.  They’d look for her, my rescuers promised.  They’d get me to safety in the meantime.\n\n“No one saw anyone else, though,” someone said.  “We got the call when you were swept away but they didn’t say anything about anyone else.”\n\n“She was there.  I saw her.”\n\n“We’ll keep looking.”\n\nThey wouldn’t find her, I realized.  She was as trapped here in the waters as the horses were.  Trying to reach them.  Trying to save them.\n\n“What about the horses,” I gasped.  “Did you see the horses?”\n\nMy rescue team glanced at each other.  No, they said.  There was just me.  Just me and the churning water around me.\n\nI refused transport to the hospital and instead a stranger offered me a ride home.  I called my mom using their phone, told her I’d dropped mine in the water and that I was going to catch a ride to a repair place and see if it could be fixed.  I’d meet them at home.\n\nI didn’t tell them I almost drowned.  I didn’t tell them about my great aunt or the horses.\n\nA lot of houses were lost in the flood.  There was only one drowning death and I read the announcement anxiously, trying to see if they had dark and curly hair.  It was a man though.  A young man that had stayed behind to try to get more of his things out of his apartment before it flooded.  There was no mention of a woman and they didn’t find any bodies even after the water receded.\n\nDad finished his chemotherapy.  I stayed for a few more months while he recovered from the ordeal and then I got a job offer and it was time to move on to somewhere else and start the next part of my life.  I packed up my things, but by then, we’d sold or donated most of the dishware and other assorted things in the basement.  There weren’t any boxes to move back into my bedroom.\n\nI went back into the basement one last time, though.  I took a few deep breaths.\n\nIt didn’t smell like anything.  There was no trace of the smell of hay.\n\nAnd outside, I backed out of their driveway and drove away in the bright sunlight with not a cloud in the sky.",

        "text": "You can tell when you're being watched. There's nothing to actually *prove* this, but everyone knows it's true. And as I crept my way through the woods, rifle in hand, I knew there was something else with me.\n\nI'd been out in the woods on weekend hunting trips for years, and this wasn't the first time I had felt this way. Usually it just meant I had been noticed by whatever critter I had set my sights on, though on one occasion my observer happened to be a rather irritable grizzly bear. This time, however, felt different.\n\nI stopped moving, and peered around, trying to locate my unseen watcher. I scanned the trees carefully,  wondering if perhaps I was just being paranoid. Everything was still, quiet. But the feeling remained.\n\nThe gaze didn't feel hostile, like the staring of a predator stalking prey, instead it felt, well, I guess curious I suppose is how to best describe it. Like a child staring at you on the subway because you're dressed funny. After a few moments, I heard a soft noise somewhere in the distance, something not unlike the sounds of a set of wind chimes in the breeze, but not quite right. I turned to look, but saw nothing but a flutter of leaves. The sensation of being observed subsided, and I continued on my path, trying my best to shrug it off.\n\nAt the time I figured it must have been a fellow hunter, maybe wearing camouflage. It explained why I didn't see them, and why the gaze didn't feel dangerous, but I couldn't quite put my finger on the sound I'd heard. For some reason that noise bothered me, and I didn't understand why.\n\nEventually I reached the hunting blind I'd set up deep in the woods and settled in for a few hours of watchful relaxation. I'd brought a book with me so I wouldn't get too bored, though I needed to make sure I'd look up from time to time lest a whole herd of deer appear right under my nose.  \n\nI sat there in silence for a while. Maybe an hour or two. It was peaceful that deep out in the forest, utterly tranquil. Part of why I went hunting was to get in touch with the sublimity of nature, to experience isolation from the busyness and squalor of urban life. It was pleasant to be alone, with only trees and birds for company.  \n\nI was pondering this when suddenly I heard a twig snap. I put down my book quietly and looked out of my hunting blind, searching for the source of the sound. After a few moments of scanning the trees, I saw my target.\n\nIt was a buck, with a magnificent rack of antlers. Ten points at least, and perfectly symmetrical. I'm not usually one for trophy hunting, I'm generally just in it for the meat and as an excuse to be outdoors, but even I was impressed. I figured at the very least they'd look good on my mantle.  \n\nI raised my rifle and took aim through the scope, lining up the shot just right. I wasn't in any hurry, it hadn't seen me, so I had plenty of time to steady my breathing and place the buck's head squarely in my crosshairs. It would have been a clean kill, an instant, painless death. That's when I got that feeling again. I knew that I was being watched.\n\nI could tell it was the same observer from earlier, I guess you could say the \"vibes\" were similar, but the intentions were different. Before, whatever was watching me had simply been curious, but now it felt angry. Like it was jealous.\n\nThe buck noticed something was wrong too, its ears pricked up, and it started to look around nervously. I knew that I had to take the shot right then, or else I wouldn't have another chance. It was about to bolt.\n\nBut something held me back. I heard that faint sound of something almost like wind chimes from behind me, and I closed my eyes and set down my rifle. I didn't know what was about to happen, but I sure as hell knew I didn't want to see it. This decision may have saved my life.\n\nThe chimes grew louder and closer, mixed in with the sound of rushing wind. Whatever it was, it moved as quickly as a freight train. I heard it move past me like the rush of waves against the beach, the pseudo-musical chiming reaching an almost unbearable volume.\n\nI heard the buck cry out for a split second, before its scream was silenced with one of the most bizarre noises I've ever heard. I can't even hope to describe it accurately. It was somewhere between a slab of gelatin being pushed into a paper shredder and a crystal chandelier crashing to the floor, but even that doesn't fully do the hellish cacophony justice. It was so loud it made my ears ring, and it was followed by such intense silence that I swear I thought I had gone deaf. The whole forest had gone silent, as if every living thing was too scared to make a sound.  \n\nEventually, after the silence had passed and the birds started chirping again, I opened my eyes. There was nothing there. No buck, no blood, no drag marks, nothing. It was as if it had never existed at all.\n\nIt was going to get dark soon, so I quickly left the blind, hiking as quickly as possible back to camp, perhaps a tad faster than was strictly necessary. I kept listening intensely, horrified that I would hear the sound of something not quite like wind chimes coming towards me.\n\nFinally, I reached my tent. I was tempted to just pack up my gear and hightail it back to my truck, but by this point it was so dark that I feared I would get lost if I did so. Instead I simply slipped into my tent and got inside, fully clothed, with my loaded rifle next to me.  \n\nI didn't sleep at all that night. At some point around 2 or 3 AM, I felt a presence outside my tent. The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end, and that feeling of being watched came back in full force. After a few minutes of this, I faintly detected that sound of the almost wind chimes, very quiet, from outside. I clutched my rifle with white knuckles, not wanting to go down without a fight.\n\nThe chiming increased in intensity for a moment, followed by a loud, wet *thump.* Then, the not-quite wind chimes faded into the distance, and the paranoid sensation of being observed abruptly vanished.  \n\nI still didn't leave my tent until the sun came out. I sat alone, terrified that the thing would come back, until the first rays of sunlight peaked through the fabric of the tent. I know it's childish, but I felt safer in daylight. As I unzipped the tent flap and stepped outside, I detected a strange odor, almost like ozone. As I hastily began packing my things to leave, I stepped in something which I quickly concluded must have been the source of the smell.\n\nIt was a slimy pile of what looked like white and gray strings on the ground, along with a rounded object about the size of my fist, with a texture like undercooked noodles. I had no idea what I was looking at, until I noticed the two small orbs connected to the rounded object with white strands. Eyes.\n\nIt was the entirety of a deer's central nervous system, meticulously stripped of flesh and removed from the body.\n\nI nearly vomited on the spot when I understood what I was looking at. I've butchered deer before, but I'd never seen anything like this before or since. It would take a master surgeon to do something with that much precision.  \n\nI knew immediately that whatever had killed that buck left this here. It was a gift, a sign of appreciation for me letting it take the kill, an attempt at sharing the bounty. I don't know if the thing that took the deer knew what parts of it we ate.\n\nI packed up my campsite as quickly as possible and practically ran back to my truck. I haven't been hunting since.",

        "text": "I wish I didn’t end up in this corner of the internet. I really, really wish that I didn’t feel an instinctual need to share what happened to me. But alas, such is life. I need to tell someone before I completely lose my grip on reality and end up in an asylum somewhere.\n\nI’ll share my horrible experience with Morana Air, but first  —\n\nAnyone here know if 40 mgs of Maxalt combined with alcohol (two glasses of wine and a gin and tonic to be specific) can lead to hallucinations? I’ve tried consulting Google, but it’s not giving me the answers I want. If you know anything about mixing migraine medication and booze let me know.\n\nI want to believe that this was all just a terrible nightmare brought on by not following the doctor’s orders. I really, really want to believe this was all just a hallucination.\n\nBut now I’m here.\n\nAnd people don’t come to this corner of the web for medical advice.\n\nSo, I work a job where I travel to lots of small cities around Europe. Usually by train, sometimes by car, rarely by plane. My agency is based out of the states and sometimes, rarely, I have to fly back to headquarters at a moment’s notice. Yesterday was one of those rare days.\n\nI also have severe migraines. I take daily prevention pills but I also carry Maxalt if the migraine slips through. They slip through pretty often. In that regard, yesterday was a completely regular day.\n\nI don’t want to go into too much detail about what I do — but I was in a village near the Polish-Slovakian border attending to some business. My usual trips take less than a day, but this particular assignment was proving to be more time consuming than usual. I was just in the middle of tying off loose ends when the call came in.\n\nQuick flight back. Top priority. No exceptions.\n\nRare, but not unprecedented. I drop everything and get in my rental. On my way to the village, I drove through the city of Poprad. Sleepy town, population of about 50K but has a rail connection. I figure I’ll catch a train to the nearest big city, jump on a connecting flight to Warsaw and then fly direct. As I drive, I call my tickets guy to sort out my airfare.\n\nAgain, I don’t want to go into what I do for work, but it’s important to note that financial oversight isn’t a strong suit of the agency I work for. One might, let’s say, deliver an expense report for a trip from London to Paris totaling around $ 450. That’s a reasonable price for a last-minute ticket. One can deliver this expense report and then, without making too much fuss, ride the $ 60 bus instead with none of the accountants being the wiser.\n\nMe and the ticket guy have an arrangement. He finds the most expensive way to get from point A to point B and then he finds the cheapest way to get from point A to point B. With a bit of graphic design tinkering and some stretching of the truth the agency would fund the pricy travel plan, I’d take the cheap route and me and the ticket guy would split the difference.\n\nMy ticket guy quickly identified the worst way to get to the states. Poprad to Krakow by rail, Krakow to Warsaw by plane, a pointless flight to Helsinki and then a direct first-class flight to the East Coast. Total price for a last-minute booking — $ 1800. The cheapest flight was found just as quickly, but the ticket guy was hesitant to pronounce the deal:\n\nA direct flight with *Morana Air* from the Poprad Airport lifting off a couple minutes past one AM — $ 115.\n\nI didn’t expect Poprad to have an airport, let alone a trans-Atlantic flight. Neither of us had heard about Morana Air before and their online presence was slim at best — but a $ 1700 split in my favor was hard to turn down. I told the ticket guy to book the flight, calmed down his worries about getting caught in the scam and hung up the phone.\n\nIt’s in the exact moment that I hung up that the migraine hit me. I didn’t make anything of it then, but looking back I can’t help but to think of that particular headache as a warning. It was as if my body knew that a flight with Morana Air was a bad idea.\n\nI took my first dose of Maxalt after I dropped off my rental near the Poprad city center. I still had a couple hours to kill before I’d have to make my way to the airport so I decided to stroll around Poprad’s old town and hope that the mountain air would wash out my headache.\n\nIt didn’t.\n\nPoprad’s historical section is endearing, but small. After a couple laps around the empty streets, I settled down at a restaurant to get some food. I hoped that a second dose of Maxalt would make me feel whole again but it didn’t. The gnocchi with bacon and cheese tasted exquisite, but after a couple spoonfuls my body started to protest the meal. Not wanting to ruin my suit, I laid off the food and ordered myself a glass of wine.\n\nThe wine helped, but it didn’t help much. I followed the first glass with a second glass, paid and then grabbed a taxi to the airport.\n\nThe Poprad International Airport was just as small as I anticipated it to be and just as empty as its size would imply. Aside from me the only other travelers at the check-in desk were a bickering family of Poles that were running late for their flight. The high-pitched yelling of the matriarch of the family did little to ease my headache.\n\nWhen I got to the check-in desk the young woman behind the counter was excited to speak to someone who spoke at a regular volume and even more excited to practice her English. She asked a lot of questions about what I was doing in Slovakia. They were friendly in nature but my migraine and my reluctance to talk about work kept the exchange professional. When she handed me my ticket, she said she “hoped I would have a safe travel.”\n\nHer hopes were deeply misplaced.\n\nWith a trans-Atlantic flight being that cheap I presumed that there would be crowds of people trying to hop on, but aside from the loud Polish couple arguing with the attendants at one of the gates I was seemingly the only traveler in the airport. I arrived three hours early, as is recommended for international flights, but I presumed other travelers would fill in over time.\n\nThey didn’t. I would be the only passenger on the Morana Air flight.\n\nThe Poprad Airport has two runways and three terminals and is significantly smaller than the city’s old town. I walked around the airport trying to focus on the breathing exercises my doctor recommended to deal with the migraines but they were of little help. As I took my laps around the airport, I’d occasionally see the hopeful glimpses of the duty-free store employees awaiting a potential customer. With each circle around the airport that I made more and more of the stores shuttered their windows. By the time my legs started to hurt the lights in the airport were turned down and only one business was opened — the bar of the VIP lounge.\n\nIt cost me €12 to enter the lounge. I paid an additional €5 for an ice-filled gin and tonic. Unlike the young woman at the check-in desk the bartender had zero interest in speaking to me and did nothing to hide the fact that he wanted to go home. I did not mind. All I wanted to do was to hold the cold glass to my temples and catch the gentlest of buzzes from the gin. When my migraine didn’t subside, I took a third dose of Maxalt.\n\nAt exactly midnight I was kicked out of the lounge with stern words of “Lounge close. Go home.” I did not complain or ask for a refund for my €12, the headache ensured I was solely focused on getting into the plane and falling asleep.\n\nWhen the lounge shut down the fluorescents above were turned down even dimmer. Walking through the empty airport in near darkness was somewhat unsettling, but by then my migraine had grown to a strength which made complex thought impossible. I was just happy that the fluorescents weren’t burning my eyes.\n\nI sat in the dim blue light of Gate 2 for the last thirty minutes of my departure time. There was no plane, or staff, or other passengers and the boarding door was closed. I should have been worried but the breathing exercises kept me calm and focused on the pain. I just sat there at the dark and empty gate looking at the snow capped mountains in the distance. I tried to imagine myself at the peak. I tried to visualize the snow and wind cooling down the inside of my skull and easing my stomach.\n\nThat’s when I heard the boarding door creak open. Somehow, in that mix of pain and booze and medicine I had completely zoned out. In my fugue state a plane had arrived. The departure screen had lit up with an announcement:\n\nFlight AD1347 Destination: Norfolk International — Morana Air.\n\nThere still was no staff at the gate and I was the only one at the terminal but the doors were open and the plane was there. I was confused, I was definitely confused — but I was more concerned about getting in my seat and passing out.\n\nThe Morana Air plane made the small airport look even smaller. The airbus was jet black with the exception of a scrawled logo on its tail and it was bigger than any plane I had ever witnessed. The sheer size of the machine didn’t dawn upon me until I made my way through the jetway and entered the plane.\n\nAs if the entire baggage hold were taken out, I had to walk down a flight of steps to reach the seats. The luggage containers were impossibly high up and the entire ceiling of the plane reminded me more of a cathedral rather than a mode of transportation. There was no staff to greet me, nor were there any other travelers. The only suggestion of life on the plane was the music coming from the speakers. It was quiet and slow and had a strange repeating baseline that kept on changing in tempo.\n\nI, once again, found this very strange. I found the whole affair strange enough to shuffle up and down the plane searching for a member of staff or another passenger to assure me that I am at least aboard the right aircraft. No living soul presented itself and soon enough my confusion was overtaken by the throbbing pain inside my skull. I sat down in my assigned window seat and tucked my suitcase under the seat in front of me and tried some more breathing exercises.\n\nI kept on hoping that someone would walk down the aisle, that I could ask for some painkillers or at least a splash of whiskey — but no dice. Only the weird music was there to keep me company. Not knowing what else to do I continued the deep breathing exercises and gazed out of the window at the plane’s massive black wing. On the edge of the wing, blinking irregularly, sat a blood red signal light.\n\nIt did not ease my migraine.\n\nFor a couple of minutes, I considered getting up knocking on the pilot’s door. I was fully aware of how strange the situation was, but the migraine made the prospect of walking up the aisle to chat with the pilot seem just as absurd. Unable to balance the debate in my sore skull, I buckled my seatbelt and committed to staying put.\n\nThe moment the metal on my lap clinked the plane started to move. The eerie music crackled out of the speakers and was replaced with a static drenched voice. The pilot’s speech was intelligible. At first, I thought it was because of the quality of the speakers, but it quickly became apparent that he wasn’t speaking English.\n\nI waited for a translation of the announcement but it never came. This — again — bothered me, but my body was drained enough to give up. I just hoped I could get some shut eye and wake up somewhere above the Atlantic without my brain sizzling.\n\nI woke up much earlier.\n\nThe first shake barely woke me. The overhead lights had been turned off and only the dim shine of the emergency exit remained. Outside, beyond the red glow of the flashing signal light the Tatra mountains stood. Still half asleep, with the migraine slowly making itself known — all I could do was stare at the snow tipped peaks and dark valleys past the window.\n\nThe realization took a while to click, but when it hit — it hit with nauseating force:\n\nThe plane was flying far too low.\n\nA terrible groan came from the bottom of the plane. The floor vibrated against my feet, as if something had been scraped against the slim undercarriage of the airbus. The plane was flying too low and we were passing over a forest.\n\nThe sudden rush of fear tightened my throat. I tried as hard as I could to yell for help, to alert someone — anyone — to the fact that the plane was in danger of crashing — yet all I could do is whimper. My whimpers were quickly overpowered by more dark scratches against the hull of the plane.\n\nThere was no turbulence warning from the pilot. The seats around me were empty. I was alone in a dark strange airplane and I was certain that all that awaited me was a fiery death. Not knowing what else to do I kept my seatbelt buckled and braced for impact.\n\nThe plane swayed and shook and the floor beneath my feet continued to vibrate. I’ve never understood people who are scared of flying; it was, after all, less dangerous than driving on a highway. \n\nI never understood those people — until I found myself in that dark plane.\n\nSuddenly, the idea that this massive heap of metal was even in the sky felt discomforting. All of mankind’s advances in aviation technology felt like a fluke. I became certain that I was sitting in a machine that was an affront to God and that I personally would be held responsible for man’s plane-related sins. I held my head in my hands and prepared for the dark rumbles beneath my feet to tear me down into the darkness below.  I do not know if I cowered for seconds or minutes — time became completely irrelevant.\n\nAll I know is that eventually the noises stopped. Once the scratching had subsided all I could hear was the gentle hum of the plane’s engine and, beneath that hum, ever so gently, the eerie music that had played when I entered the airbus. I raised my head, hoping to see the plane high above the clouds.\n\nI was sorely disappointed.\n\nI wanted to scream, but my panic only manifested itself as a coughing fit. Outside of my window, bathed in the glow of the moon and the blinking signal light sat the mammoth wing of the plane. All along its length the metal was dented with signs of terminal impact. Beneath the broken wings, far too close for comfort, I could see the crowns of trees.\n\nI was nauseous with fear and my fingers felt like foreign digits, but I still managed to unbuckle my seatbelt. I thought my terror had reached its limit, but just as I pulled myself out of the row of seats my fear reached new heights.\n\nA loud pop shook the entire machine. On the other wing of the plane I could see the engine flare up with smoke and flames. The origin of the pop quickly became apparent —\n\nGeese.\n\nI could see them from my own window. A flock of them was flying right next to the plane completely unaware of the danger. Two of the fowls got bumped off course by the wing and then, a third, entered the massive engine.\n\nWith another loud pop a second fire broke out. Clutching at a hope for survival that seemed insane — I dashed up the airbus towards the cockpit. With all my strength I slammed at the metal door. In my sheer despair I even managed to find my voice. Words were more difficult to grasp, but the screaming and banging was enough to convey my message —\n\nThe sole passenger of the plane was concerned about the imminent crash.\n\nI slammed at the cockpit door like a wild animal, but my cries were ignored. With each slam of my first that quiet music from the speakers grew louder and louder. Soon enough my wails for help were joined by more dark scratches against the body of the plane.\n\nWe were passing through another forest.\n\nThe aircraft shook and groaned and the music from the speakers rolled on with its unsteady beat, but I did not relent. I kept on slamming the door and screaming and begging for a way out. The world around me was descending back into chaos, but I did not relent.\n\nI did not relent until I felt a gust of wind at my back.\n\nWith an unearthly metal crack, a part of the airbus gave away. Behind me a scar cut across the metal wall of the plane. Bits of burning wood stuck out of the fresh hole like terrible birthday candles. With another deafening roar, a strip of wall to the right of me gave way for a burning branch that almost felled me.\n\nI fell to my knees and crawled away from the burning wood, but I couldn’t bring myself back to my feet. The airplane was swaying from side to side with nauseating violence and my heart was balancing an incoming feint with bursts of primal adrenaline.\n\nLike an epileptic infant I crawled through the chaos towards the nearest seats and buckled myself in. As numb and shaking as my fingers were, they worked quickly. I chose the center aisle seat. It seemed safest that way.\n\nOnce I was in my seat my consciousness drifted further. There was nothing else I could do. All that was left was to watch the plane be ripped apart by the forest it was flying through. With each removed scrap of metal, the discomforting music on the speakers grew louder and louder.\n\nI braced. I braced and I prayed for my end to come quickly.\n\nIt did not.\n\nInstead, the plane shook like mad and the music grew louder and my chest compressed with unsustainable anxiety. I tried focusing on the music, but it made me feel ill. I tried to focus on my breath but it was far too shallow to grasp. The only thing that provided escape from my terror was the migraine. It was still there. Hidden by the panic and terror of the ongoing plane crash I was able to ignore it. Yet as I braced and prayed for my end to come quickly — the familiar pain became more pronounced.\n\nI focused down on the burning in my skull, taking apart each and every unpleasant sensation that I could think of. I did the exact opposite of what the breathing exercises told me to do. I held on to my thoughts of agony and squeezed as hard as I could. I let go of all perception and simmered down my existence to nothing but a headache.\n\nWith my diminishing internal monologue, I tried to describe my pain with as precise words as possible. I composed metaphors and similes and poems that transformed my migraine from something that could be tempered with Maxalt to an insurmountable disease.\n\nI reveled in the poison behind my eyes until it took me whole.\n\nSomehow, in the middle of a plane crash, I managed to pass out.\n\nI — again — would like to believe that the entire flight was a hallucination, or a break from reality or whatever other explanation would make it possible for me to discount the event entirely. I was dosing way above my doctor’s recommendations. I did have a particularly severe migraine attack. I was already highly stressed from work. There were a thousand explanations for why I might’ve misinterpreted reality while I was getting on the plane in Poprad.\n\nWhat is impossible to discount was that the flight that I took arrived at its destination. The panic and pain and sheer insanity of the aircraft pacified me, but when I woke I was exactly where I passed out — buckled into seat 6A of Morana Air Flight AD1347\n\nHad I woken up in the strange plane I boarded in Poprad International I would have no doubt the entire affair was a fabulation, yet the plane I woke in had clearly seen a terrible night. The carpet had been matted in ash and mud and straw. Where the tree branches cut through the walls the night prior now jagged scars of metal remained. The aftermath of the crash was obvious, but the plane remained whole.\n\nSo did I.\n\nMy immediate instinct was to run — to head straight for the door and never turn back. That is exactly what I did, I left the cursed airbus as fast as my legs would allow. I was already a couple steps into the jetway when the realization dawned on me.\n\nFreedom was just a couple of steps away. A part of me was sure I could even hear the bustle of Norfolk in the distance — but I knew I couldn’t leave just yet.\n\nMy suitcase.\n\nAll I wanted to do was to run, to report my suitcase got stolen and never turn back to that plane again. But I knew that retrieving was my only option. The agency I work for might skim through expense reports but they take info leaks deadly serious.\n\nWhen I entered the airbus a second time the arched ceiling felt twice as high. That discomforting funeral music was back on the speakers but this time it seemed darker, more tired. As quickly as I could, I made my way to my original assigned seat. My suitcase had made it through the flight, but it had been singed by whatever fire had burnt in the plane the night prior.\n\nI wasted no time sprinting back to freedom.\n\nBehind the desk of the gate was a boy of no older than twenty wearing an airport uniform that seemed to have been passed down by an older brother. When I dashed out of the jetway he had been scrolling on his phone. My appearance clearly startled him, but the moment we made eye contact he went back to scrolling on his phone.\n\nI did not try to communicate. I simply wanted to get as far away from the airbus as I could.\n\nIt wasn’t until I had gotten a rental and started the drive to headquarters that I called my ticket guy. My recollection of the flight to him through speaker phone was undoubtedly less eloquent but differed little from the account I have just written.\n\nI don’t think he believed me, but even if he did — what would have changed?\n\nThere's an all hands meeting happening in thirty minutes and I can’t let myself be consumed by what happened last night. I hope that someone will be able to explain away my hallucination with a mixture of stress and pills and booze. If not, I’ll just take my own word for it.\n\nMy suitcase is indeed burnt, but once I get some down time I’ll get a new one. All of this is best forgotten. All of this is best left in the past.\n\nOne lesson remains though, dear internet stranger:\n\nNever book a flight with [Morana Air](https://www.reddit.com/r/MJLPresents/comments/11k3ds4/morana_air/).",

        "text": "So I'm currently writing this in my living room, something is wrong with where I am at at the moment, I don't know whether it's the moon or the light or whatever it is but something is strange. I will tell the story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, it started off like a normal evening, I was just on my phone watching Tik Tok listening to r/nosleep stories to which I then got bored and wanted to read them on my own, I went on r/nosleep which to I was greeted with a huge selection of stories, I read through a couple and I was already getting chills, until my page refreshed on it's own and I saw a new story titled... \"look at the moon\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince it was already night time the moon would be out and I thought nothing of it, I started gazing up at the moon only to find out it was a full moon, but not regular, it was so beautiful and so bright, I've never seen it like this before, I mean of course I saw a lot of full moons but never one of such beauty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was home alone so I couldn't get my parents or my sister to look at the moon with me, I kept gazing up on it until I stopped, something in my head was telling me to stop, I don't know what it was but I just had to stop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went back on the page just to see that the story never existed, I tried looking for it, I refreshed it, I searched it up but such a story never existed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Hm, weird\" I thought to myself, how is it possible that such a story showed up for me but in reality was never there? But how come I saw it then? \"Whatever\" I thought to myself and walked to the kitchen and made myself some popcorn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile in the kitchen I heard something, like a footstep, it sounded like it was right by me but when I looked there was nothing, it was as if it never happened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was barely 10PM so I didn't think about bed, I sat down on my couch, turned on the movie and started eating popcorn until I suddenly got a text from my Mother.  \n\n\n\"Hey! Did you see the moon already? It's so beautiful right?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI thought nothing of it because it was a normal text, then I went on her chat and I read messages that I didn't even get...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe one that creeped me out the most was: \"Hey I won't have any service until tomorrow, so if you need anything call me on mobile!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow come she sent me this message without any service? I immediately responded saying \"You have service?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot even 5 seconds later I get a response saying \"look at the moon\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Alright that's it, first that fucking story and now my mom texting me this shit? What the fuck is going on!?\" is what I thought to myself, well those were one of the thoughts, there were at least 500 thoughts flowing through my mind and I didn't know what to do anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went in the hallway and locked the front door immediately, I locked every window and the backdoor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Okay, I feel safer now...\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe moment I said that I heard about 50 knocks at my front and backdoor, it felt like my head was gonna explode, I went to my room locked the door and started to cry like a child, the knocks didn't stop they just didn't stop... Then after 5 minutes they did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Holy shit, thank god!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI felt safe until something whispered in my ear \"look at the moon\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI jumped up and ran into the corner while thinking to myself what I should do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME??\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut no answer...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI grabbed my phone and called the police.  \n\n\n\"Hello??

        "text": "(First: https://redd.it/o8vgiw Previous: https://redd.it/11nyvou )\n\nI’ve gotten into a pretty good routine at work. Sunny started to send me on my way with snacks or a packed lunch. Sometimes those snacks saved my life by offering them to a monster that wanted to take a bite out of me on delivery jobs. On occasion, I did a job with a different co-worker if Max needed to help with another job. I was human in a mailing company of monsters and yet survived this long. Any time I got comfortable, the world decides to show me just how dangerous it can be. \n\nI don’t remember much about the start of that day. I went to work, a sandwich from Sunny safely packed away in my jacket pocket. When I arrived, I saw Max rolling on the floor without his uniform jacket on. He kept rubbing his back against the carpet. I asked his sister what was wrong, and she explained he rolled in some grass with some pretty nasty bugs. He suffered from some bites and couldn’t scratch himself through the uniform jacket. I told him to put his jacket back on before we went off to the first job of the day. I was handed a simple envelope with a request to deliver the letter to an empty warehouse. \n\nI know I walked through a door toward the delivery location. Then a ringing started in my ears. I turned, seeing nothing but darkness around me. My chest felt heavy along with my bad arm. \n\n“Max?” I called trying not to freak out. \n\nThe empty darkness spread outwards with no sign of my friend. I didn’t understand what was happening. Fear overtook my body. My mind felt like I’d forgotten something very important. I didn’t know where I was or how I got there. I pressed, trying my best to remember what happened. We walked through the door, and then what? \n\nA small flicker of a memory came. Only a fraction of a hint of the rest of the day before the darkness took over. Max and I walked into the warehouse looking for the person to deliver the letter to. I knew we got that far but then what?  \n\nA flood of anxiety came over me causing me to nearly double over. I’d forgotten why dread took over my mind and yet it was still there. My breathing got fast and rough as I slowly got down to my knees unable to stand up with the flood of emotions going through my body. I kept thinking about Max as if I knew something happened to him and yet my brain refused to tell me what. I gritted my teeth trying to push past it all. I needed to get out of this darkness and back to my friend but felt so weighed down by my emotions I didn’t know the cause of it. \n\n“There you are. It's been a while.” \n\nMy head snapped up at the voice. I never thought I would ever see the person standing in front of me again. He held my old phone in one hand, his white hair shining in the darkness. \n\n“Elly...?” I asked slowly. \n\nThis small boy was The Silver King. I didn’t fully understand the title, but he was super important. In fact, he was the most powerful creature, and every other monster respected him like a God. I heard he greatly disliked people treating him like the cute kid he looked like. He should have picked a less cute name if that was the case. The shock of seeing him wore off. I realized if he stood here, that things were very bad. \n\n“How are you liking the job?” He asked, ignoring how scared I felt. \n\n“This isn’t the time for a job performance review! I need to find Max!” I sputtered trying to stand up. \n\nA weight tugged at my bad arm. I realized I couldn’t get up because of it. It didn’t hurt, which was nice but that didn’t make me worry any less. \n\n“It’s the only time I have. I’m very busy. Invading your dream is the best I can do to ask some questions.” Elly explained sounding a bit bored. \n\n“My dream? I’m asleep?” I questioned. \n\nElly nodded and yet, I didn’t feel better. Why was I sleeping? We were on the job, right? Did something attack me and knock me out? \n\n“Don’t worry about other stuff right now. You can deal with it when you wake up. Tell me how the job has been going.” The boy said to get my attention again. \n\nI paused to think of what I wanted to say. I’ve nearly died so many times with this job. I’ve seen horrors normal humans wouldn’t be able to deal with. I felt the guilt of being the reason why Slithers ate a person, regardless of how much he deserved it. Rufus lost a leg because of me. He still had issues walking and a bunch of people who cared about him got angry at me for that. I’d cut off my arm to save Max and needed to deal with the annoying creature that ate it. And I found out my apartment building was haunted and still carried the grief of what happened to that poor girl who died behind the walls of the building. Elly gave me time to think about all of this and decide my answer. \n\n“It’s pretty scary most times. I have issues sleeping and I really think I won’t last long doing this job. But I like it. I care about the people I’m working with, even the annoying ones. Now can I wake up? I think something happened to Max.” I answered back. \n\nI looked over my shoulder as if a way to snap back awake might appear. When I looked back, I was shocked to see a smile on Elly's face. From the little bits of information, I heard about him, he acted like a sullen kid. I decided I wanted to ask him a question that had been bothering me for a while. \n\n“Why... Did you give me this job?” I said. \n\nHe paused and then lifted my old phone. He used it to trap Vicky to save me and gave me a new one for work. It took me a few seconds to clue into why he brought it along then my face turned red from embarrassment. \n\n“You sent Vicky a text thanking her for the date after she turned into a monster and tried to eat you. I figured you would be the type of person who could work well with creatures of the night. My job as King is to serve them. You proved I made the right choice.” He explained and for a second sounded a bit older than his small body appeared. \n\n“Thank you. I have had some days where I really didn’t want this job but overall, I’m glad for it.” I admitted to him. \n\n“Do you love the monsters you work with?” He questioned sounding a bit gentle. \n\nThe ones I’ve met have killed and eaten humans in the past. They would do it again if needed. And yet, I found myself still being able to care about them. In truth, I almost felt as if I turned my back on my own species and didn’t really care. \n\n“I do. They’re important to me.” I said with a nod. \n\n“Then you should wake up and tell them.” \n\nI heard his voice then the feeling of falling overtook my body. My eyes opened to a mass of pain. I let myself get adjusted to the feeling before being collected enough to figure out what was going on. All at once, the memories of what happened came flooding back. We arrived inside the warehouse trying to figure out who requested the letter to be delivered. Max strayed a few steps away from me to look at a small box by one of the large cement support pillars inside the empty building. His face dropped into an expression I’d never seen from him before. He ran towards me and wrapped his uniform jacket over my head protecting it. A split second later, the entire building came down on top of us in a massive explosion. \n\nMax acted fast enough to protect me from the damage. I woke up to him over me resting on his elbows and knees. My left arm helped out a little. It transformed into a large fur-covered claw that held a massive amount of rubble from dropping down on us. The weight threatened to separate my arm from my shoulder. All the pain faded when I saw my best friend fully in the dim light. \n\nBecause Max used his jacket to save my face from being burned off, he left himself exposed. He supported the weight of literal tons of stone on his back, with some iron bars finding their way through his body. His face hovered over my own dripping blood onto my cheek. His body transformed slightly to stay alive. His eyes glowed yellow in the dark and his mouth became filled with sharp teeth. His arms fully turned into claws that itched to dig into the meal so nearby. Along with blood from his head wound, some saliva dropped down. He wanted to eat me. My best friend was slowly dying, and his body reacted in an understandable way. \n\n“Max...” I choked out unable to think of anything else to say. \n\nMy mouth was dry from the dust in the air and my throat hurt from tears. He noticed I was awake and instead of acting worried, his face turned into a smile glad this his partner was alive. \n\n“Are you alright Toby?” He asked, his voice weak. \n\nI nodded, unable to speak just yet. I didn’t know what the building suddenly came down, or how to get out of this. \n\n“I’m pretty sure this was a trap from The Hunters. Sometimes their delivery requests slip through and they kill the ones who show up. I’m sorry you got tangled up in all this.” Max explained, trying to keep himself calm. \n\nI found myself shaking my head. Those Hunters killed his family in the past. He'd lost so much to them and yet he never turned his hatred toward humans. Max got worried I died because of the feud between humans and monsters. If I could move my arms, I wanted to hug him. There might not be another person on Earth as sweet as him. \n\n“Is there any way to get out of this?” I asked him. \n\nI looked around trying to find an escape route. Aside from some small cracks to let some sunlight through, there weren't any openings the rubble large enough to get through. If Max moved, we risked having the cement shift and us getting crushed under it. \n\n“I’m thinking about that. It’s not my strongest trait so it’s taking me a while.” Max joked in a strained voice. \n\nI looked down to see just how much blood his stomach wound was already bleeding out to the ground under us. I didn’t know how he was still alive after all of this. I fought back the panic to try and think of anything to help. My head snapped back up wondering why Max didn’t try an obvious thing. \n\n“Can’t you drink some of my blood? You wouldn’t need to move much, and it would heal you, right?” I offered. \n\nI didn’t know if he took some of my blood if it would give him enough energy to get free. At the very least, I didn’t want him to suffer for much longer. Max shook his head, tears coming to his yellow eyes. At my offer, I saw fur start spreading and his face becoming even more animalistic. He fought it back trying not to become a monster and I understood why he hadn’t taken a bite while I slept. \n\n“If I let myself drink your blood, I won’t be able to stop. I’ll kill you. I don’t want that.” He said, voice shaking. \n\nHe raised his head so I could see his distraught face. His body started turning into the creature he really was against his will. If this kept up, he wouldn’t be able to hold himself back from eating me to recover. Max knew he could become a feral monster and hated it. His eyes flooded with tears and the rubble on top of his back shifted slightly. I pulled my good arm out from under him to clear away some of his tears with my palm. He pressed a cheek into my hand, nearly unable to keep himself from breaking down. \n\n“I don’t want to lose another sibling.” He sniffled. \n\nThe sight tore at my heart. His mother had been killed years ago and I heard a few more family members died as well. I never asked who he needed to bury back then. It was possible he had a few brothers that died and never talked about it. He'd been carrying the burden of them most of his life. I didn’t want to add my death to all of that. But right now, it looked as if only one of us would be getting out of this alive. \n\n“I feel the same way you know. I would rather you live through this instead of us both dying.” I told him in a stern voice trying to get my point across. \n\nHe chewed on his bottom lip understanding but not accepting the idea. He would rather die than let another family member he loved go without being able to do anything about it. I thought back to the talk I had with Elly and knew this was the time to say a certain thing. \n\n“I’ve really liked working with all of you. It’s been scary but-” \n\n“Don’t.” Max whispered interrupting me, but I kept going. \n\n“I’m glad we met. I’ll never forgive myself for Rufus getting hurt on my first day. But if he didn’t, I might not have partnered up with you. We’ve met a lot of people, you know? Your sisters are great. Slithers helped me out even though they didn’t need to. Belizas is well, herself. And we got to help Sunny too.” \n\nMax listened, tears coming down his face in silent sobs. I should have been scared to death. My best friend needed to eat me alive to save his life. It would hurt and yet I felt happy looking back on it all. It would be worth it because of one simple fact. \n\n“I love you. You’re the best brother anyone could ever ask for.” \n\nI’m surprised I didn’t break out into tears saying something so emotional. Max let out a small hiccup. Aside from his monstrous features, he looked a bit younger at that moment. He carefully leaned down to press his forehead against my own causing some dust to kick up around us. I kept my hand on his cheek praying this would be what he remembered and not the feeling of sinking his teeth into someone important to him. \n\n“There is a way out of this. If I tell you my true name, I can take some of your blood and you can control me, so I won’t go feral.” Max whispered. His tone was heavy. \n\nMy stomach turned over the suggestion. I’ve heard a little bit about true names. It was something a human like myself would never understand. If a person knew a true name of a creature, they could control them until it died. The name was something so protected and dear to the creatures they refused to even let their family hear it. It essentially was giving someone access to their very soul. I shook my head, not wanting Max to go through being so exposed in such a personal way. \n\nHe brought his head back enough for me to see his face. His expression showed me everything I needed to know. He didn’t bring up this option until after I told him my feelings. He now knew he could trust me with his entire self. He would have rather died with me than give away his name to someone if they didn’t truly love him as family. \n\nI didn’t stop him from leaning over again, his mouth by my ear to whisper a word that meant more than anything else in the entire world to the both of us. I don’t think I could explain what language that single word sounded like if anything remotely close to any kind of structured word. It was more like a sound filled with emotions. The quick whisper reminded me of bright orange sunlight through the trees. It honestly sounded the same way love felt. \n\nMax pulled back, cheeks red from crying and expecting a negative reaction. Anyone who put themselves out there in such a way would have acted the same way. Even though we were in such a dire situation, I looked up at him and started to laugh. His face broke and we both fell into quiet laughter from accepting each other so completely. \n\n“Max, please take some of my blood to get us out of here.” I told him in a small voice after our giggles died down. \n\nAnything I said to him now carried weight. If I asked him to kill himself, he would without a second thought. I needed to be careful in how I spoke to him in the future. Any request could be turned into an order. With a smile full of sharp teeth. He brought his face down to bite into my exposed neck. It hurt like a bitch but was worth it. \n\nA ripple started through his clothing. He pulled his face away and a burst of power came from his body. I knew about magic but never felt it that way before. Colors swirled around us, and the world changed for a few seconds. In a flash the cement debris that pinned us down got tossed aside, landing hard in the empty parking lot the warehouse used to sit in. \n\nI’d covered my eyes to keep the dust from them. When I opened them again, I was staring at a cleared area and for the first time, I saw Max for what he really was. A wolf taller than a building stood shaking the dirt from its golden-brown fur. He stomped a foot and life exploded from his paw leaving behind a lush area of green. Flowers that glowed like the moon bloomed then faded in a burst of light. For the first time in a long while, Max finally could stretch out his real body. He didn’t care if we might be near a city or if other humans might see him. He just arched back his head and let out a long cheerful howl towards the setting sun. \n\nThe sound echoed through the sky and turned into his laugh. His massive body shifted into the human one I’ve always known him as. He quickly scooped me up in a hug and we laughed like idiots again just glad to be alive. \n\nA door suddenly appeared off to the side. It burst open spilling out at least ten of his sisters. They all ran over clearly worried to death. They must have found out about the trap, and everyone only just arrived to help. Rufus came next followed by a very scared Sunny. Belizas came, tripping over her own feet. Some creatures I’ve worked with in the sorting room hurried through along with A’nk. They all piled into us talking over each other. Sunny found us and wrapped both his dear friends into a hug refusing to let go. \n\nIt took a very long time to get everyone settled and the situation was explained. Even after we told them what happened, everyone still kept talking convinced we were still hurt. My fake arm looked like a normal human one, but I found I couldn’t feel it at all. They said I might need to get it replaced again, but I wasn’t really worried. \n\nI nearly died again. I doubted very many people faced death as often as I did. I Looked over each person that came rushing over when they heard Max and I got in trouble. I realized then I would gladly die a hundred times over if that meant I could keep the family I found because I got forced into a very scary job dealing with monsters.",

        "text": "The traffic in the city was buzzing, everyone on their daily mission to get to work or to school; their daily mundane routines.  I was already late, honking the horn of my Kia while waiting for my wife to bring our son so we can go.  He was about to start school for the first time and we needed to find the right school. We already had it narrowed down.  Before making our final decision I went toward my old school in the area I grew up. What better than the area where I grew up right?   \n\n\nThis is where it all started. \n\n\nSo much had changed since the last time I set foot in that old building and yet the principle was still the same person.  It was quite a sizable school built right next to a church. It was one of those schools owned by a church. This wasn't something that bothered my parents as they were quite religious. \n\n\nWhen we grow up we tend to question everything our parents taught us so I chose a different path.  \n\n\nA school is a school, however so I thought I would give them a fair chance.\n\n\nWe pulled into the crowded entrance, there was a church service.  At least I can avoid that by going around the back and meet with the principle and teachers observing the way they teach.  We arrived during lunch so the kids were outside and we had a half hour to speak to them respectively and determine whether it was the right place for our child to attend school.   \n\n\nMy eldest daughter was already in grade 3 and had no need for this kind of thing anymore. It's a pity her preschool closed down otherwise there would be no option to choose from. \n\n\nTrain of thought is a crazy thing, my mind buzzing as I continue to walk down the familiar corridors thinking about my average childhood in this severely disciplined arena.    The school had been slightly rearranged to suit the needs of the staff while the amount of students grew; therefore it took us a while to find the correct room.   \n\n\nThe principle was still in a meeting and therefore running late. We waited and started speaking to the teacher who would take our son had we decides to enrol him.   \n\n\nIt was off.\n\n\nThe atmosphere was strange and uncomfortable. Perhaps some repressed memories or perhaps something much deeper that has no way of hiding its energy\n\n\nI thought to myself as the teacher was barking orders at the neatly seated students. Preschool children dressed in neat uniforms with tucked in shirts and a finger in their mouth.   \"Little soldiers\" were what they were raising.  Discipline isn't a bad thing however freedom and love are more crucial for human development!\n\n\nI sat and waited for an extra half hour before I decided to abandon the idea of my son ever being a part of this elicit authoritarian concept altogether. As my wife and I walked away I yelled profanities at the principle while I was starting to recall all the abuse that had befallen me during my long visit at this institute. \n\n\nI approached the gate i needed to pass in order to sneak around but someone had locked it while we were waiting for the principle resulting in us having to walk through the large church building filled with people, the front row staring at us without blinking. \n\n\nMy mind had already gone dark, I was remembering things. I was unhappy. In my mind this was the source where all my unhappiness started. \n\n\nWhat had they done to me?\n\n\nI made another scene as all the rush of emotion returned from my childhood.\n\n\nI uttered something about how no person should be condescending and how a prisoner can't change their ways while being a prisoner. At that moment my eyes fell on the back section of the auditorium where the faces of all the people became clearer as burdened while they were shrunk in their seats, looking down in despaired. \n\n\nIsn’t it interesting how we notice certain things more clearly based on our state of mind? If I had been in a good mood, I would be noticing something else, thinking different things.\n\n\nAs we passed them they were occupied with their guilt and own lives, i suppose.\n\n\nThis is the sad reality we find ourselves in when we get our self-worth from the words of one individual without testing the facts I thought to myself.  I used to always need validation from others. I guess I still do, that’s the problem.  Why else is this all sitting with me so intensely.\n\n\nIt felt strange. It felt painful and I just wanted to get out of there. \n\n\nWas all that haunted me really that easy to run from? Was the person I had become all that different from the people I was trying so hard not to embrace?\n\n\nWe were out the front doors; we were slapped with the morning sun and a breeze of vanilla passing their bake sale in the distance as we walked further until we reached the final doors which would momentarily free us from the weight of this moment and all the expectations, all regulations and every bombastic stair.  I thought it was over, all the memories could be boxed right back in and I could merely continue my path and learn my new lessons about the new life I was bravely embracing.\n\n\nThe show was only getting started. \n\n\nI was about to be confronted with myself and every profound, unhealed mystery that still lingered within myself.\n\n\n\n\nEmerging from the left of the entrance was an elderly lady whom I did not recognize. She looked as if she didn't belong; she gave off an eastern atmosphere. Her energy was different.  She approached with an intent held deep within her eyes which were Grey like a person who had been born blind.\n\n\nTo make the uncanny situation more intense, she approached us not being part of this organization at all and seemed to have a completely different perspective. A perspective I had become the entire familiar with as everything eastern was my new dedication. I ran toward it and made it my mission. \n\n\n\nI'm not sure from where she originated but she gave off the energy of someone who dabbles in palm reading or energy reading just like I did.\n\n\nShe went to my family members one by one in a loving manner to embrace them and tell them something about themselves and offer a sense of encouragement based on our current situations.\n\n\nShe approached my wife first.  She had a look of pity in her eyes as she said \"my child, you have to let people in. You have been through much and your family do not even know. Walls do not keep the demons out, they keep them in\"\n\n\nThese words penetrated me, in that moment I knew that she was not the first person to say the exact same thing that particular day.  \n\n\nAnother uncanny coincidence how we pick partners who are so much like ourselves and end up facing the same struggles, sometimes we are even unaware.\n\n\nShe moved on to my daughter telling her about her beautiful imagination and how thoughtful she is, encouraging her to continue being herself.\n\n\nWhen she approached me, she stopped dead. She couldn't understand me.  I was not readable. However instead I went into a Trans and told her all about her life, her white aura and her trustworthy dependable nature.  She was not puzzled. She smiled. She did her greetings and departed. \n\n\nThis was a strange, wild morning. It weighed on my wife and I; we drove home, having our own thoughts in complete silence.  \n\n\nLater that evening we were preparing supper. We had a house guest that evening sleeping in our spare room; my wife's sister. She was close to all of us so we spent time with her in the one room.\n\n\nThat evening started off ordinary. We spent most of the time catching up with my sister in law from out of town who had many stories to tell and so did we having mostly forgotten our previous interactions as if it were merely a dream.   \n\n\nMy brother in law (my wife's brother) arrived during our conversation and chimed in on the discussion we had as children were running about the house doing their normal share of giggles and messiness.  They blended into the background as we were onto a new subject about politics or travels or some sort of famous celebrity like we usually do.\n\n\nAt this point, I had to leave the room to put my phone on charge in the main bedroom.\n\n\nAs I arrived, in the main bedroom, there it was. \n\n\nThe shadow.\n\n\nIt was a figure in my bedroom occupying the furthest right corner, the entire wall slowly filling with the darkness it was expelling. All you could see was the shadow and its deviant red, burning eyes.  The fear instantly took hold of me like a hurricane during a peaceful day coming unexpectedly!\n\n\nI screamed. \n\n\nThen I ran back to the lounge\n\n\nAs I was about to hide, there was a loud knock on the front door.   It was the lady from earlier.  Before I could ask any questions, she yelled \"everybody get outside\" as she seemed to have a deep knowing, she started slowly walking through the corridor where My sister in law was praying to no avail as it was impossible to change the ever growing dark, devouring my bedroom.  She pulled her out of the house and snapped her out of the Trans she was in before signalling me to follow her towards the room I had grown afraid of with paralysing effect.\n\n\nShe had come prepared; she rushed into the room and immediately started chanting a phrase in Latin.  Don't ask me what it meant, I had no time to ask.   She continued until the dark was gone, it exited out the house through the bedroom, passing right through me in the process.\n\n\nWe left the room; however the others remained outside, on the front porch, taking in the full scenery outside.   \n\n\n\"No!!\" I yelled \n\n\n\"It hasn't left, it is right here. I feel it\"! I continued alarmingly \n\n\nYes, just as she thought the dust had settled a voice spoke out loud. \n\n\nThe voice was deep and sounded like a thousand men yelling.  The thing I feared the most was that it came from inside me! \n\n\n\n\n It felt like I was watching from the outside as I proved to her that the entity had not left while the lights flickered, breaking the windows and making the TV change through the channels.    My brother in law came in at that time responding to the alarming noise. The voice shouted to prove its existence and it held on.\n\n\nIt did not want to leave.\n\n\nThe lady was not alarmed, not surprised. She merely pulled out a book; it looked like a journal of some sort.  She paged through it and told us that the entity was within me and everything we saw externally was a mere projection and we needed to expel it.\n\n\nI hadn't known it at the time but the moment we saw, she had been there for a reason. My hostile internal environment made a perfect home, if you already guess it.\n\nI was probably triggered during my visit and the past came flooding out like an ocean triggering all my darkest urges and fears, leaving me bound by the entity that I created as a depiction of all my fears and unresolved trauma.  \n\n\nShe grabbed the book and said she knew exactly what to do.  She said there were 5 steps we had to follow in different sections of the house and finally we would be able to expel it.   We followed behind her toward the lounge.\n\n\nStep 1 was the incense she burned.  She had me and my brother each light our own to burn throughout.  She said that the creature did not like the smell of lavender.   Which in hindsight explains why positive energy always smelled like lavender, like she did?  It however was triggered by smells such as vanilla, black current (strange that I am so triggered by these things right?) \n\nOnce we had finished burning the incense we moved on the step 2\n\n\nStep 2 was in the dining room area which was an open plan right next to the kitchen.  She said we should open the big window to the right, turn on the lights outside which was facing the empty right side of our front yard, away from everyone else. We were to clear the curtains and open the windows; she needed a screen. Upon saying the incantation she would allow me to use the screen to release it.\n\n\nStep 3 was strange, I didn’t understand it, but I trusted her so I did it.  She made us create beaded bracelets for our Arms; I suppose some kind of anti-possession charm or something.  Each of us was to have a different colour. Mine was blue and red, my brother’s was black and hers was purple. \n\n\nI couldn't manage to do mine so she did it for me.\n\n\nWe continued as the lights continued to flicker more violently, I became more alarmed as the voices screamed and my head throbbed while the devil was becoming disturbed, pounding trying to find a way out. Everything was shaking as if falling to pieces.\n\n\nShe grabbed us and took us to the kitchen where step 4 would occur. \n\n\nWe all held hands facing the kitchen wall as she started another Latin incantation; an intensely complicated sounding one but I think I know what it meant, for as she started, my brother and I were In a Trans. I watched from outside my body as both of us kept chanting the phrase \"I am enough\" right before we passed out. \n\n\nAll three of us. \n\n\nI woke up in a field with the Lady, my brother and many people I recognized.  We were all seated facing the furthest end of the field.\n\n\nThe lady said the people around me were those that I fear, some I hated and some people that hurt me and I haven't let go.  She said in order to be free I had to let go, forgive myself and let them go.  As I did that we started hovering and moving toward the end of the filed some faster than others. \n\n\nShe whispered in my ear \n\n\n\"In your mind you have the power to be anything, to beat anything. You are in full control and decide how fast you go. Everything that you face outside of you is controlled by you and you have the steering wheel. Using your mind, you choose how fast you want to go and where you want to go. You make yourself bigger or smaller!\" and the moment I realised that my mind was my steering wheel, my driving force. I sped up, hovering past everyone until I reached sonic speed.  The moment I reached the end of the field I heard a thunder like the hammer of god.   \n\n\nI had realised my own power. I was not a victim anymore!\n\n\nWe were back in my kitchen. The lady grabbed me and pushed me toward the window where I stretched my hands toward the glass. What had come out of me felt like thunder and burned like electricity. It felt like an eternity of shaking as it escaped from within me.    It went up to the sky and exploded like confetti and I knew that it was over.\n\n\nIt was over ",

        "text": "  \n\nIf there’s one thing that kids everywhere can probably agree on, it’s the fact that bedtimes suck. You want more time in the day to do things you enjoy, or at least enjoy more than lying down with your eyes shut doing literally nothing at all. It’s even worse when it’s summer and the sun isn’t down yet. Even worse when it’s summer in Fairbanks, Alaska and the sun basically won’t set all summer. \n\nBut above all, I think it’s the fact that you have to do something, anything at all, that primarily annoys us as kids. We don’t want to do what we’re told and even if your parents aren’t very strict, they probably at some point or other told you when you had to go to bed. Maybe your parents even rewarded you for going to bed without a fight when you were told to. Just to encourage you to not be difficult and give them some peace and quiet. \n\nBut then there’s the fact that you have no idea when you’ll go to sleep. For all you know, it’s completely possible you’ll just stay up the whole night, lying there with nothing at all to distract you but your own thoughts. It isn’t likely, sure. But it’s still a thing that could theoretically happen. You need sleep to live so not being sure you’ll actually be able to do it can be extremely scary. And it’s not like other things you have to do to live like breathing or eating or drinking where you can just consciously do it whenever you want. Sleep has to come to you. And not being able to do it is like drowning except for the fact that drowning kills you in minutes whereas lack of sleep takes weeks or even months to do the same.\n\nMy story about the game that I would come to know as “Sleep Points” began in the winter. Not that winter in central Alaska is much better. There’s the obvious fact that it’s cold as all hell, but then there’s the fact that, unlike in summer, the sun basically never rises. It’s pretty much impossible not to have seasonal depression when you only have maybe 3 or 4 hours of sunlight a day, where the sun only just barely creeps above the horizon.\n\nI remember it being Mid-February of 2019, about a year before the pandemic hit. Monday the 11th to be exact. I remembered it because the day you start playing sleep points matters.  Not to get too far ahead of myself, but basically, the amount of time you’ve spent playing determines where you are in the game. But I’ll get back to that later since in the beginning I didn’t know anything about how Sleep Points worked.\n\nI guess it isn’t surprising that Monday, February the 11th started out normally. Days that end up being important always seem to. I got introduced to the game at school when I had to stay after class since I had gotten a detention. I know that probably makes me sound like a bad kid or some kind of troublemaker, but this was honestly the first detention I’d ever gotten. I mostly kept to myself and kept a low profile.\n\nMy school doesn’t really have bullies, but the more popular guys on the sports teams and stuff still gave me crap now and then. I guess there was this one other, less popular, outcast kid that you could probably call a bully, but we’ll get to him later on, during detention. Anyway, it wasn’t like anyone ever shoved me into lockers or gave me wedgies or whatever other crap you see on TV. Not usually anyway. The harassment was mainly verbal. Like how this one kid, Brian Truman, would always mockingly ask me if I wanted to fight. I guess he thought the idea of me fighting him was funny since he was tall and athletic and I was short and somewhat out of shape. But I could usually just ignore it.\n\nBut that day was different. That day I managed to have my first ever as-seen-on-TV bullying experience. Though thankfully I haven’t had one since. Anyway, after third period, some of Truman’s jock buddies talked him into stealing my backpack. My fourth period was really far away from my locker, so I absolutely did not have time for this. I shouted at him to tell him to give it back, but he just kept saying I wouldn’t get it back unless I agreed to fight him. For whatever reason, I tried reasoning with him for another minute or two. But eventually, the bell was about to ring and I lost my patience. I socked him in the face. He gut-punched me so hard I lost my breath. I tried to fire back but conveniently a teacher showed up just in time to not help me get my stuff back and to instead give me a detention for fighting.\n\nEven though I had to stay after class, I guess it wasn’t all bad. Truman was at least true to his word, and I still had my things returned to me, no thanks to the teacher. But I still spent most of fourth period, which I was about 5 minutes late to by the way, upset about the fact that I got in trouble and the fact that my parents were going to get called, all for a situation that I didn’t even start. Fortunately, I had been good about being on time to my fourth period U.S. History class since I knew how far away it was from my locker, so I always made a point to get there as fast as possible. Since this was just my first lateness, the teacher, Mr. Springer, let me off with a warning, so I guess I don’t have too much of a right to complain about having been late.\n\nI spent most of the remaining day just wondering what detention would even be like because again, I had a totally clean record up to this point. Okay, okay, you get it. I’m not saying I was some star student with stellar behavior up to that point who just did no wrong. But I had still never thought of myself as the type of kid who got detention. I had still considered myself the type of kid who at least had somewhat reasonably good behavior, so I just never thought something would happen to make me end up there.\n\nAnyway, when the end of the school day finally came and I got to the detention room, it was pretty much empty except for the teacher overseeing detention named Mrs. Bagfield from my fifth period algebra 2 class and this other tall and scrawny kid who was a junior, making him about 2 years older than me since I was a freshman at the time. He pretty much made it his mission in life to get as many detentions and in as much trouble as humanly possible. He was the only one there besides Mrs. Bagfield and I since Truman got assigned to a different room for detention on account of how the reason we were both in detention in the first place was for fighting one another.\n\nHis name was Ezra Livingston. They called him “Ezra the Edgelord”. And by “they” I really just mean Ezra himself. No one else seriously called him that outside of making fun of him for the lame-ass nickname he came up with for himself. I had never talked to him very much, but Ezra was the type of kid where, even if you hadn’t met him, you knew about him on account of all the negative attention he was always trying to attract toward himself. He was pretty much as stereotypically contrarian as they come. Just like his nickname says, he was just insanely edgy.\n\nI talked about how my school didn’t have any real bullies, but I think Ezra comes closer to being one than just about anybody else there. This was, of course, the one kid I was talking about before whom you could probably call a serious “bully”. He wasn’t the type of kid you’d usually think of as a bully, though, since he wasn’t on any sports teams. And, like I said before, he wasn’t popular, and was instead pretty awkwardly tall and lanky so it’s not like he even looked all that buff or intimidating or anything.  I know I’m a bit on the shorter and chubbier side since I’m 5’5” and weigh something like 170 or 180 pounds, but this kid was easily a good 9 or 10 inches taller than me and must’ve still weighed about 40 or 50 pounds less than I do. \n\nAnyway, he just did whatever he could to piss anybody around him off. It never mattered who it was or what he had to do to make it happen. He’d act like that even around guys way bigger than himself, too. And yeah, they’d kick his ass, but he never cared about that. Any beating was worth getting a rise out of somebody as far as he was concerned.\n\nI was kinda glad to have detention with Ezra though, just because Mrs. Bagfield spent way more time with her eyes on him than on me. Even when Ezra wasn’t in detention, faculty and staff kept their eye on him. He’d always joke about shooting up the school or bringing a bomb or something like that. And I guess just because he’s the type of loner edgy kid who might seriously do something like that one of these days, the teachers always took it seriously.\n\nSince I was bored, I started looking around at the desk I was sitting at, looking at the swastika and pentagram and anarchist and communist symbols and all kinds of other offensive shit drawn on it. No doubt all of them were drawn by Ezra from when he must’ve sat at that desk during one of his countless detentions. These symbols might seem a bit incoherent all being placed next to one another but, as Ezra himself would always say, his politics were “Go to hell and go fuck yourself”. And he pretty much lived his life by that motto.\n\nLike I said, pretty much as textbook contrarian as they come. Like yeah, he drew a swastika, but I had pretty serious doubts he was an actual Nazi. He always seemed to have too much of a problem with authority to actually go along with an ideology like that during the time of the Third Reich. He probably just knew the swastika was just another symbol that offended people, so he threw it in there for good measure. Now, I’m sure he was totally aware of its association with the Nazis and what they stood for. Pretty much any history class will teach you about that. I just doubt he cared since he never cared about much of anything.\n\nBut of course, other people had sat at that desk before too, and there was this heart drawn with the initials “BT + AB” in it, since Brian Truman and Anastasia Bowman were a couple. I’ve already told you about Truman, being that he was the asshole who took my backpack and landed my ass in detention in the first place. But I don’t think I’ve brought up Anastasia just yet.\n\nAnastasia was actually born in Russia, but since the last name she was given at birth was spelled “Bauman” and her family didn’t want English speakers calling them something like “Baw-man” by mistake, they had the spelling changed to “Bowman” since their name is pronounced like the words “bow” and “man”.  Of course, it didn’t really do them as much good as they had probably hoped, because their name is pronounced “Bowman” like taking a bow, but people would still pronounce it “Bowman” like bow-and arrow by mistake anyway. But I guess because they had already committed to the name change, they just decided to roll with the new spelling regardless. \n\nShe was in my 6th period Environmental Science class. On the first day of school the teacher, Mr. Brigham, had us do all the usual lame-ass ice-breaker bullshit the teacher usually has you do. When it was Anastasia’s turn to talk, she had told us all about what I just talked about: how she was born in Russia and her family came to America, but that she was too young to remember when it happened so she couldn’t really tell us a whole lot about what living in Russia was like.\n\nI don’t think any of us would’ve known about that without her telling us. She always spoke in a very sophisticated sort of way and always with a perfect American accent. I guess since she had lived in the U.S. for as long as she could remember, that must’ve helped her adopt the accent. But even by like halfway through the school year when all the Sleep Points shit started happening, I hadn’t really learned a whole lot else about her.\n\nWhat I mainly wound up taking interest in during detention, though, was this post-it note in the back of the desk. I started picking at it just to have something to do with my hands, but I got curious and took a look at it. I almost dismissed it out of hand. Oh, what could have been. It was just a bunch of random letters, numbers, and punctuation marks. Maybe whoever wrote all those characters just wrote them down randomly because they were bored. \n\nBut in any case, since I was bored too, I played a game with myself where I’d try to type all the characters as one big word into google and see what results came up without getting caught. I mostly thought that nothing would show up, but I figured that sequence of characters still had to mean something. Like maybe it was part of a link to a video or article or something and google would direct me to whatever that was.\n\nEven though the sequence of characters was pretty long, it wasn’t actually all that difficult to “win” at my little game. Ezra was of course being his usual provocative self being as disruptive as possible and cursing at the teacher whenever she complained. Like when she complained about how he brought in a bag of Cheetos to detention and seemed to be making a point to crunch them as loudly as possible. Food wasn’t allowed in detention and Mrs. Bagfield had a major pet-peeve about people chewing or crunching loudly. So when she took them away from him, he called her a bitch and talked about how touching his food with her “cum-coated hands” spoiled his appetite anyway.\n\nThis of course would not be the end of Ezra’s antics. Pretty much as soon as the teacher took his Cheetos away, without missing a beat he pulled out a pack of gum, put it all in his mouth all at once, and then started chewing that as obnoxiously as possible instead. Since you can’t really swallow gum, or at least you’re not supposed to, he tried to make the case that technically gum wasn’t a food, making it fair game for detention. But Mrs. Bagfield wasn’t buying it. \n\nShe said it was a “distraction” and then Ezra asked what she was gonna do about it and if she could take the gum out of his mouth any better than she can take the dick out of hers. That comeback fell a bit flat, since with all the gum in his mouth, his words were kinda muffled at that point. But, to my surprise, she actually put on some plastic gloves and then forced his jaw down and literally took the wad of gum straight out of his mouth just like he said. “Don’t give me any more ideas”, she said after she threw it in the trash can.\n\nWith all of that going on, I was able to type in all the characters from the post-it note without detection. And when I did, something surprising happened: one result actually did come up. It was the exact string of characters, none removed, no extra ones added in, nothing. I clicked on the result and it took me to the app store. It had an icon of a guy in bed snoring, so I figured it must be some app about sleep.  Maybe it would play relaxing sounds or have someone doing ASMR or something like that to help you fall asleep. I didn’t really know what the app was all about, but since I was bored to death and trying to kill time until detention was over, I downloaded it just to check it out.\n\nBut it didn’t even look like you could do anything with the app. I opened it up and all I saw was a blank white screen with the number “0” at the center. That number was of course meant to tell me how many sleep points I had, but at the time I had no idea what it was supposed to mean. To me, it was just a meaningless number. I tried to delete the app since it was obviously useless and just gonna take up space on my phone. But for whatever reason, I couldn’t actually seem to delete it. That seemed weird, but at first I didn’t think much of it. \n\nFinally detention ended and since my dad had already gotten a call about how I had gotten a detention, he knew to come pick me up and said I was grounded for a week from electronics. I tried to explain the situation to him, and how someone else had started it and I the fact that I really needed what was in my backpack for class, but before I could get anywhere with that, he just cut me off and started lecturing me about how I should’ve gone to a teacher. \n\nObviously telling on somebody never really makes you popular, especially when you’re in high school. And even then, the teachers give so little of a fuck about the students that I doubt they would’ve even helped me anyway. So we got home and I got treated to pretty much the same lecture from my mom. \n\nThen my dad asked me for my phone. I took one last look at it knowing it’d be the last one I’d get for the week. And when I did, I noticed that my phone was only at 10%. That seemed really weird since I never let its battery get below like 20% and it was at about 60% at the start of detention. So I had no idea how it managed to lose half of its battery life within the hour or so between then and now. Since I noticed it was almost dead, I asked him if he could keep it on a charger in his and mom’s room, and he agreed.\n\nBut my phone’s battery wasn’t the only weird thing I noticed when I got home. Once I entered my room ready to spend the rest of the day doing homework and complaining to myself in my head about what had happened that day, I noticed a little analog clock sitting on my bed stand that I’d never seen in my life. It had a white casing surrounding the face with a flat bottom that let it stand up on its own. It also had a pane of glass in front of its face so that you couldn’t touch its hands, but you could still see the time.  I didn’t know if my parents had randomly bought me a clock as some sort of gift or how it had gotten into my room.\n\nBut I liked having little mysteries like these to speculate about just to keep my mind occupied and distracted from everything else that was going on. Like, for example, maybe I just misread the battery percentage at the start of detention and it was just a lot lower than what I thought it was. Maybe my dad had gotten me a clock just so that I could count down the seconds to when I’d be ungrounded or at least to have something to look at while I had no way to pass the time.\n\nAt around 5, according to my new clock, my dad came into my room to tell me to start doing my homework. I figured he’d talk about how he had given me a clock as a gift, or at least start grilling me on where I’d gotten it from. But he didn’t say a word about it. He didn’t even notice it was there for all I could tell. That presented me with another mystery: Was I the only one who could see this clock? Did my dad just think I had always had it? Had I really had it all along and I just didn’t bother paying attention to it until that day, when I had nothing better to do outside of watching it?\n\nRight when I had gotten done with homework, my mom called me to the kitchen for dinner. She and dad talked all about how they were “disappointed in my recent behavior” and that I needed to get my act together because what had happened was now on my permanent record and colleges were gonna look at that, and how I’d better stay out of trouble or else someday I might get expelled. \n\nBut I think the fact that Ezra still went to my school pretty much disproved that. Even though Fairbanks is the one of the biggest cities for like hundreds of miles, it’s still fairly small just because no one lives in Alaska. So there’s still only so many schools a kid can go to if you were to ever get expelled. And even then, the school him and I went to called “College High School”, was probably the only one that would take him anyway, since pretty much all the other schools in and around Fairbanks had better funding and higher standards for what kind of student was allowed to go there.\n\nI know “College” is a pretty weird name for a High School since it is, after all, a High School and not actually a college. But there’s a little town called “College” within broader Fairbanks because of the college nearby, and since my high school was nearby also, it got the seemingly contradictory name that it did. But anyway, like I was saying, if you ever did manage to get expelled from our school, it wasn’t like there was anything else they could do with you, so no one ever really was.\n\nOnce I had eaten dinner, I went back to my room. I noticed that according to my new clock, it was 8 in the evening. I didn’t even know that much time had passed since last I checked, so I was a little surprised.  I also noticed that the clock’s face was a bit reddish or pinkish when I had remembered it being white when I first looked at it.\n\nMaybe I had forgotten it’s color. Or maybe I was just seriously losing my marbles from what a day I had had. I didn’t know for sure at the time if this was all connected to the app with the long string of characters for a title with the icon of a guy snoring in his bed that I had just downloaded, but by now, the idea was creeping its way into the back of my mind, so I was somewhat beginning to suspect it. Not that I could check my phone to be sure. But still. The app had to do something. And it just looked sketchy as hell.\n\nSince there was no point in staying up since there was nothing to do, I just tried to go to sleep. Though since it was so early, I didn’t find it very easy to do that. I tried boring myself to sleep by watching the clock. It had some interesting qualities. For example, I noticed that the clock’s color definitely was changing over time. By 9:30, I knew for sure that the face of the clock had to have gotten redder than what it was when I first looked at it at 8:00. And I was able to tell since I also noticed that the redder the clock’s face got, the more it would glow in the dark. \n\nAt first, I honestly thought it looked pretty cool. I had never seen a clock do that before, so whoever had mysteriously given me a clock at least had the decency to give me a glow-in-the-dark one, which I thought was nice.  But with my room being pitch black and my only source of light being a clock whose face kept getting a deeper and deeper shade of red, and one that was slowly getting brighter and brighter at that, it legitimately started to get a bit spooky, I’m not gonna lie. \n\nAnother hour and a half later, it was 11:00 and if I wasn’t spooked before I definitely was by then. At around that time I had to seriously start questioning my own sanity. Because I thought for sure that I was beginning to see a human’s face in what was supposed to be a clock’s face behind the glass and the clock’s hands. Or at least vaguely human. I had read about how if you look in the mirror long enough in the dark, you start hallucinating faces that aren’t there. That must’ve been what was going on. Maybe the glass in front of the clock’s face was just reflective and acting like a mirror, and I was just looking at my own face. But that still didn’t explain why the clock was changing color. Or why it had gone from being just a normal clock to one that glowed in the dark. All without me pressing any buttons or really doing anything with it at all come to think about it.\n\nThere also wasn’t any reason I could find for why the face in the clock seemed to be getting more and more clear. Where before, I thought I might’ve just been seeing myself, the face got to the point where it was so clear, that there was no way that could’ve been me. By 11:45 I had been convinced this couldn’t be a hallucination. I know the whole point of hallucinations are supposed to be that they look real, but I’m sorry. This just looked too real to be in my head. By that time the clock had also gone a deep shade of total blood red. \n\nAnd the face almost seemed to be trying to escape from the clock. Like it was going to do something to me when it did. And let me tell you, this was not at all a pretty face.  I’d say it looked like death, but I get the feeling even death would be more attractive. It wasn’t smiling but it did seem to have an abnormally large mouth. In fact, it wasn’t even just the mouth. All the facial features, the eyes, nose, and mouth all seemed unnaturally large. They looked like they were growing and when the clock could no longer contain them, whatever was inside was gonna suddenly burst out. \n\nBut it was mainly the eyes that scared me. Most people have eyes that are white and have black pupils, but for this face it looked like the exact opposite with black irises and white pupils. The pupils also looked slender. Sort of vertical like what a cat’s might be. But it was more than just how different these eyes looked from regular eyes. Honestly, that was the least of my worries. It was the expression they had. I got the feeling that with each passing minute those eyes were just getting even more hate-filled and predatory than the last.\n\nBy 11:57, I had totally lost my shit. The color, the brightness, the clarity of the face, the size of the face, the look of hatred, all of it was coming to a head. I know this all probably sounds pretty stupid, but I was honestly more terrified than I could ever remember being up to that point. I just tucked my head under the covers and laid down totally flat, without moving a muscle.  This all must’ve been leading up to something that would happen at midnight. I didn’t know what that would be, and I was fighting for my fucking life not to find out. \n\nFor what must’ve been the next 3 minutes, I thought I was dead. Literally dead. Whatever fucking demon was in that clock was just about to drag me straight down to hell. “So this is how I die” I told myself in my head since I was still too mortified to make a sound.  Not that it had felt like 3 minutes. But that made sense because, what with my whole-ass life flashing before my eyes, I’ll bet time probably would’ve had a way of seemingly slowing down. \n\nI heard it. I had heard a sound that sounded like glass shattering. The clock was broken. Whatever was in the clock had obviously come out by now. I heard it as it slithered and snaked its way around my room. “Just don’t move, just don’t fucking move. Whatever it is, it won’t know you’re there”, I told myself. I wouldn’t find out for another week or so just how right I was. Or at least, that I had been kind of right. It’s complicated. But at the time, the clock-demon or whatever the fuck kind of supernatural shit it was that was fucking with me, seemed to just randomly disappear. \n\nIt must’ve been at least a good fifteen minutes before I finally got the courage to stick my head out from under the covers and see what was going on. Nothing was there.  Not even the light from the clock. But that made sense to me from how it had obviously been broken by that point. I didn’t know why the thing in my clock left. But I was in no mood to question it. Just glad it was gone. I must’ve spent the rest of the time I was still awake that night, just praying to God that that never would happen again. Despite the fact that I was an atheist.",

        "text": "June 1st, 1997\r\nThe things are deadly creatures, but we do not know what they are. Their plan is going to send me into where the things are, but the problem is no one knows how to get there. The scientists are trying to figure it out though. A lot of people have been going missing without a trace, but they all go missing around the same area, so I hope they figure it out soon. I was given this journal to document what I see. They didn’t guarantee that I would come back, but I’m getting paid good money to do this, so its gonna be worth it.\r\n\r\nJune 3rd, 1997\r\nThey found a way to get into wherever the things live. They haven’t really described to me in detail onto what the things look like. I’m not sure if they even know…anyways, I’m supposed to be leaving tomorrow. I’m nervous to say the least.\r\n\r\nJune 4th, 1997\r\nI made it into the things home. I was sent with this journal, a pen to write with, a flashlight, a camera, and some food and water to last a couple of months. The room I’m in right now looks oddly familiar, but I know that I’ve never been in it before. It has a dull yellow carpet, matching with the walls. The carpet feels wet, but its not. The room is heavy, almost humid, and it smells weird. The only source of light in the room is a dull lamp in the corner, making a buzz sound. And finally, there’s a door. It looks like any other door, not even a lock on it. Weird. \r\n\r\nJune 5th, 1997\r\nAll the rooms in here are the same, the only thing that’s different is the door, always appearing on a different section of wall. I’ve gone through about 50 by now. No sign of the things. But the walls seem to be talking to me, or that’s what I think at least. Hell, maybe I’ve already lost it.\r\n\r\nJune 7th, 1997\r\nI’ve gone through so many doors that I’ve lost count. They’re all the same. I can hear the walls. It’s like they’re telling me to run. I feel like I’m being hunted, like the walls have eyes. Even though the walls keep on warning me, I feel like I don’t need to run from the things. I don’t know, maybe I’ve been in here for long enough.\r\n\r\n??????????????????????????????\r\nNothing. There’s nothing here. The things are getting closer, I know it. I don’t know how long I’ve been in here, but its so long that its starting to feel comforting. I’ve gotten skinnier, and paler. I feel like my eyes are sunken in, and for some strange reason, I feel taller. The walls are so loud. I can’t even here myself think. I don’t want to run anymore. The things can’t be that bad, maybe they just want to help me leave. I know that’s not true, and I don’t know why I even wrote that down. I think this is going to be the last thing I write in this in a while; or maybe ever. If someone finds this, then your just as screwed as I am. I pray you find a way out, and if you do, bring this to the company written on the cover; they’ll know what to do. \r\n\r\n????????????????????\r\nDon’t trust the things. Don’t trust the things. Don’t trust the things. Don’t trust the things. Don’t trust the things. Don’t trust the things.\n\r\n????????????????????????????????????????????????\r\nTrust the things! Trust the things! Trust the things! Trust the things! Trust the things! Trust the things! Trust the things! Trust the things! Trust the things! Trust the things!\r\n\r\n\r\nOctober 8th, 2007\r\nI’ve been in this hell for days. I found this journal in one of the rooms; looks like the last dude who had it went crazy, that’s comforting. He scribbled out the last couple pages, so I don’t know what he said. I don’t know how I got here, and I don’t know how to leave. I’m scared. I keep on hearing the walls talk about the thigs. What the hell are the things? Maybe they’re friendly, maybe they’ll help me escape. Maybe that’s the only way to escape is to find these things.",

        "text": "  \n\nPart 1\n\nIf there’s one thing that kids everywhere can probably agree on, it’s the fact that bedtimes suck. You want more time in the day to do things you enjoy, or at least enjoy more than lying down with your eyes shut doing literally nothing at all. It’s even worse when it’s summer and the sun isn’t down yet. Even worse when it’s summer in Fairbanks, Alaska and the sun basically won’t set all summer. \n\nBut above all, I think it’s the fact that you have to do something, anything at all, that primarily annoys us as kids. We don’t want to do what we’re told and even if your parents aren’t very strict, they probably at some point or other told you when you had to go to bed. Maybe your parents even rewarded you for going to bed without a fight when you were told to. Just to encourage you to not be difficult and give them some peace and quiet. \n\nBut then there’s the fact that you have no idea when you’ll go to sleep. For all you know, it’s completely possible you’ll just stay up the whole night, lying there with nothing at all to distract you but your own thoughts. It isn’t likely, sure. But it’s still a thing that could theoretically happen. You need sleep to live so not being sure you’ll actually be able to do it can be extremely scary. And it’s not like other things you have to do to live like breathing or eating or drinking where you can just consciously do it whenever you want. Sleep has to come to you. And not being able to do it is like drowning except for the fact that drowning kills you in minutes whereas lack of sleep takes weeks or even months to do the same.\n\nMy story about the game that I would come to know as “Sleep Points” began in the winter. Not that winter in central Alaska is much better. There’s the obvious fact that it’s cold as all hell, but then there’s the fact that, unlike in summer, the sun basically never rises. It’s pretty much impossible not to have seasonal depression when you only have maybe 3 or 4 hours of sunlight a day, where the sun only just barely creeps above the horizon.\n\nI remember it being Mid-February of 2019, about a year before the pandemic hit. Monday the 11th to be exact. I remembered it because the day you start playing Sleep Points matters.  Not to get to far ahead of myself, but basically, the amount of time you’ve spent playing determines where you are in the game. But I’ll get back to that later since in the beginning I didn’t know anything about how Sleep Points worked.\n\nI guess it isn’t surprising that Monday, February the 11th started out normally. Days that end up being important always seem to. I got introduced to the game at school when I had to stay after class since I had gotten a detention. I know that probably makes me sound like a bad kid or some kind of troublemaker, but this was honestly the first detention I’d ever gotten. I mostly kept to myself and kept a low profile.\n\nMy school doesn’t really have bullies, but the more popular guys on the sports teams would still give me crap now and then. I guess there was this one other, less popular, outcast kid that you could probably call a bully, but we’ll get to him later on, during detention. Anyway, it wasn’t like anyone ever shoved me into lockers or gave me wedgies or whatever other crap you see on TV. Not usually anyway. The harassment was mainly verbal. Like how this one kid, Brian Truman, would always mockingly ask me if I wanted to fight. I guess he thought the idea of me fighting him was funny since he was tall and athletic and I was short and somewhat out of shape. But I could usually just ignore it.\n\nBut that day was different. That day I managed to have my first ever as-seen-on-TV bullying experience. Though thankfully I haven’t had one since. Anyway, after third period, some of Truman’s jock buddies talked him into stealing my backpack. My fourth period was really far away from my locker, so I absolutely did not have time for this. I shouted at him to tell him to give it back, but he just kept saying I wouldn’t get it back unless I agreed to fight him. For whatever reason, I tried reasoning with him for another minute or two. But eventually, the bell was about to ring and I lost my patience. I socked him in the face. He gut-punched me so hard I lost my breath. I tried to fire back but conveniently a teacher showed up just in time to not help me get my stuff back and to instead give me a detention for fighting.\n\nEven though I had to stay after class, I guess it wasn’t all bad. Truman was at least true to his word, and I still had my things returned to me, no thanks to the teacher. But I still spent most of fourth period, which I was about 5 minutes late to by the way, upset about the fact that I got in trouble and the fact that my parents were going to get called, all for a situation that I didn’t even start. Fortunately, I had been good about being on time to my fourth period U.S. History class since I knew how far away it was from my locker, so I always made a point to get there as fast as possible. Since this was just my first lateness, the teacher, Mr. Springer, let me off with a warning, so I guess I don’t have too much of a right to complain about having been late.\n\nI spent most of the remaining day just wondering what detention would even be like because again, I had a totally clean record up to this point. Okay, okay, you get it. I’m not saying I was some star student with stellar behavior up to that point who just did no wrong. But I had still never thought of myself as the type of kid who got detention. I had still considered myself the type of kid who at least had somewhat reasonably good behavior, so I just never thought something would happen to make me end up there.\n\nAnyway, when the end of the school day finally came and I got to the detention room, it was pretty much empty except for the teacher overseeing detention named Mrs. Bagfield from my fifth period algebra 2 class and this other tall and scrawny kid who was a junior, making him about 2 years older than me since I was a freshman at the time. He pretty much made it his mission in life to get as many detentions and in as much trouble as humanly possible. He was the only one there besides Mrs. Bagfield and I since Truman got assigned to a different room for detention.  This was of course because of how the reason we were both in detention in the first place was for fighting one another.\n\nThis other kid's name was Ezra Livingston. They called him “Ezra the Edgelord”. And by “they” I really just mean Ezra himself. No one else seriously called him that outside of making fun of him for the lame-ass nickname he came up with for himself. I had never talked to him very much, but Ezra was the type of kid where, even if you hadn’t met him, you knew about him on account of all the negative attention he was always trying to attract toward himself. He was pretty much as stereotypically contrarian as they come. Just like his nickname says, he was just insanely edgy.\n\nI talked about how my school didn’t have any real bullies, but I think Ezra comes closer to being one than just about anybody else there. This was, of course, the one kid I was talking about before whom you could probably call a serious “bully”. He wasn’t the type of kid you’d usually think of as a bully, though, since he wasn’t on any sports teams. And, like I said before, he wasn’t popular, and was instead pretty awkwardly tall and lanky so it’s not like he even looked all that buff or intimidating or anything.  I know I’m a bit on the shorter and chubbier side since I’m 5’5” and weigh something like 170 or 180 pounds, but this kid was easily a good 9 or 10 inches taller than me and must’ve still weighed about 40 or 50 pounds less than I do. \n\nAnyway, he just did whatever he could to piss anybody around him off. It never mattered who it was or what he had to do to make it happen. He’d act like that even around guys way bigger than himself, too. And yeah, they’d kick his ass, but he never cared about that. Any beating was worth getting a rise out of somebody as far as he was concerned.\n\nI was kinda glad to have detention with Ezra though, just because Mrs. Bagfield spent way more time with her eyes on him than on me. Even when Ezra wasn’t in detention, faculty and staff kept their eye on him. He’d always joke about shooting up the school or bringing a bomb or something like that. And I guess just because he’s the type of loner edgy kid who might seriously do something like that one of these days, the teachers always took it seriously.\n\nSince I was bored, I started looking around at the desk I was sitting at, looking at the swastika and pentagram and anarchist and communist symbols and all kinds of other offensive shit drawn on it. No doubt all of them were drawn by Ezra from when he must’ve sat at that desk during one of his countless detentions. These symbols might seem a bit incoherent all being placed next to one another but, as Ezra himself would always say, his politics were “Go to hell and go fuck yourself”. And he pretty much lived his life by that motto.\n\nLike I said, pretty much as textbook contrarian as they come. Like yeah, he drew a swastika, but I had pretty serious doubts he was an actual Nazi. He always seemed to have too much of a problem with authority to actually go along with an ideology like that during the time of the Third Reich. He probably just knew the swastika was just another symbol that offended people, so he threw it in there for good measure.  I’m sure he was totally aware of its association with the Nazis and what they stood for. Pretty much any history class will teach you about that. I just doubt he cared since he never cared about much of anything.\n\nBut of course, other people had sat at that desk before too, and there was this heart drawn with the initials “BT + AB” in it, since Brian Truman and Anastasia Bowman were a couple. I’ve already told you about Truman, being that he was the asshole who took my backpack and landed my ass in detention in the first place. But I don’t think I’ve brought up Anastasia just yet.\n\nAnastasia was actually born in Russia, but since the last name she was given at birth was spelled “Bauman” and her family didn’t want English speakers calling them something like “Baw-man” by mistake, they had the spelling changed to “Bowman” since their name is pronounced like the words “bow” and “man”.  Of course, it didn’t really do them as much good as they had probably hoped, because their name is pronounced “Bowman” like taking a bow, but people would still pronounce it “Bowman” like bow-and-arrow by mistake anyway. But I guess because they had already committed to the name change, they just decided to roll with the new spelling regardless. \n\nShe was in my 6th period Environmental Science class. On the first day of school the teacher, Mr. Brigham, had us do all the usual lame-ass ice-breaker bullshit the teacher usually has you do. When it was Anastasia’s turn to talk, she had told us all about what I just talked about: how she was born in Russia and her family came to America, but that she was too young to remember when it happened so she couldn’t really tell us a whole lot about what living in Russia was like.\n\nI don’t think any of us would’ve known about that without her telling us. She always spoke in a very sophisticated sort of way and always with a perfect American accent. I guess since she had lived in the U.S. for as long as she could remember, that must’ve helped her adopt the accent. But even by like halfway through the school year when all the Sleep Points shit started happening, I hadn’t really learned a whole lot else about her.\n\nWhat I mainly wound up taking interest in during detention, though, was this post-it note in the back of the desk. I started picking at it just to have something to do with my hands, but I got curious and took a look at it. I almost dismissed it out of hand. Oh, what could have been. It was just a bunch of random letters, numbers, and punctuation marks. Maybe whoever wrote all those characters just wrote them down randomly because they were bored. \n\nBut in any case, since I was bored too, I played a game with myself where I’d try to type all the characters as one big word into google and see what results came up without getting caught. I mostly thought that nothing would show up, but part of me still figured that sequence of characters had to mean something. Like maybe it was part of a link to a video or article or something and google would direct me to whatever that was.\n\nEven though the sequence of characters was pretty long, it wasn’t actually all that difficult to “win” at my little game. Ezra was of course being his usual provocative self being as disruptive as possible and cursing at the teacher whenever she complained. Like when she complained about how he brought in a bag of Cheetos to detention and seemed to be making a point to crunch them as loudly as possible. Food wasn’t allowed in detention and Mrs. Bagfield had a major pet-peeve about people chewing or crunching loudly. So when she took them away from him, he called her a bitch and talked about how touching his food with her “cum-coated hands” spoiled his appetite anyway.\n\nThis of course would not be the end of Ezra’s antics. Pretty much as soon as the teacher took his Cheetos away, without missing a beat he pulled out a pack of gum, put it all in his mouth all at once, and then started chewing that as obnoxiously as possible instead. Since you can’t really swallow gum, or at least you’re not supposed to, he tried to make the case that technically gum wasn’t a food, making it fair game for detention. But Mrs. Bagfield wasn’t buying it. \n\nShe said it was a “distraction” and then Ezra asked what she was gonna do about it and if she could take the gum out of his mouth any better than she can take the dick out of hers. That comeback fell a bit flat, since with all the gum in his mouth, his words were kinda muffled at that point. But, to my surprise, she actually put on some plastic gloves and then forced his jaw down and literally took the wad of gum straight out of his mouth just like he said. “Don’t give me any more ideas”, she said after she threw it in the trash can.\n\nWith all of that going on, I was able to type in all the characters from the post-it note without detection. And when I did, something surprising happened: one result actually did come up. It was the exact string of characters, none removed, no extra ones added in, nothing. I clicked on the result and it took me to the app store. It had an icon of a guy in bed snoring, so I figured it must be some app about sleep.  Maybe it would play relaxing sounds or have someone doing ASMR or something like that to help you fall asleep. I didn’t really know what the app was all about, but since I was bored to death and trying to kill time until detention was over, I downloaded it just to check it out.\n\nBut it didn’t even look like you could do anything with the app. I opened it up and all I saw was a blank white screen with the number “0” at the center. That number was of course meant to tell me how many sleep points I had, but at the time I had no idea what it was supposed to mean. To me, it was just a meaningless number. I tried to delete the app since it was obviously useless and just gonna take up space on my phone. But for whatever reason, I couldn’t actually seem to delete it. That seemed weird, but at first I didn’t think much of it. \n\nFinally detention ended and since my dad had already gotten a call about how I had gotten a detention, he knew to come by and pick me up and said I was grounded for a week from electronics. I tried to explain the situation to him, and how someone else had started it and the fact that I really needed what was in my backpack for class, but before I could get anywhere with that, he just cut me off and started lecturing me about how I should’ve gone to a teacher. \n\nObviously telling on somebody never really makes you popular, especially when you’re in high school. And even then, the teachers give so little of a fuck about the students that I doubt they would’ve even helped me anyway. So we got home and I got treated to pretty much the same lecture from my mom. \n\nThen my dad asked me for my phone. I took one last look at it knowing it’d be the last one I’d get for the week. And when I did, I noticed that my phone was only at 10%. That seemed really weird since I never let its battery get below like 20% and it was at about 60% at the start of detention. So I had no idea how it managed to lose half of its battery life within the hour or so between then and now. Since I noticed it was almost dead, I asked him if he could keep it on a charger in his and mom’s room, and he agreed.\n\nBut my phone’s battery wasn’t the only weird thing I noticed when I got home. Once I entered my room ready to spend the rest of the day doing homework and complaining to myself in my head about what had happened, I noticed a little analog clock sitting on my bed stand that I’d never seen before in my life. It had a white casing surrounding the face with a flat bottom that let it stand up on its own. It also had a pane of glass in front of its face so that you couldn’t touch its hands, but you could still see the time.  I didn’t know if my parents had randomly bought me a clock as some sort of gift or how it had gotten into my room.\n\nBut I liked having little mysteries like these to speculate about just to keep my mind occupied and distracted from everything else that was going on. Like, for example, maybe I just misread the battery percentage at the start of detention and it was just a lot lower than what I thought it was. Maybe my dad had gotten me a clock just so that I could count down the seconds to when I’d be ungrounded or at least to have something to look at while I had no way to pass the time.\n\nAt around 5, according to my new clock, my dad came into my room to tell me to start doing my homework. I figured he’d talk about how he had given me a clock as a gift, or at least start grilling me on where I’d gotten it from. But he didn’t say a word about it. He didn’t even notice it was there for all I could tell. That presented me with another mystery: Was I the only one who could see this clock? Did my dad just think I had always had it? Had I really had it all along and I just didn’t bother paying attention to it until that day, when I had nothing better to do outside of watching it?\n\nRight when I had gotten done with homework, my mom called me to the kitchen for dinner. She and dad talked all about how they were “disappointed in my recent behavior” and that I needed to get my act together because what had happened was now on my permanent record and colleges were gonna look at that, and how I’d better stay out of trouble or else someday I might get expelled. \n\nBut I think the fact that Ezra still went to my school pretty much disproved that. Even though Fairbanks is the one of the biggest cities for like hundreds of miles, it’s still fairly small just because no one lives in Alaska. So there’s still only so many schools a kid can go to if you were to ever get expelled. And even then, the school him and I went to called “College High School”, was probably the only one that would take him anyway, since pretty much all the other schools in and around Fairbanks had better funding and higher standards for what kind of student was allowed to go there.\n\nI know “College” is a pretty weird name for a High School since it is, after all, a High School and not actually a college. But there’s a little town called “College” within broader Fairbanks because of the college nearby, and since my high school was nearby also, it got the seemingly contradictory name that it did. But anyway, like I was saying, if you ever did manage to get expelled from our school, it wasn’t like there was anything else they could do with you, so no one ever really was.\n\nOnce I had eaten dinner, I went back to my room. I noticed that according to my new clock, it was 8 in the evening. I didn’t even know that much time had passed since last I checked, so I was a little surprised.  I also noticed that the clock’s face was a bit reddish or pinkish when I had remembered it being totally white when I first looked at it.\n\nMaybe I had forgotten it’s color. Or maybe I was just seriously losing my marbles from what a day I had had. I didn’t know for sure at the time if this was all connected to the app with the long string of characters for a title with the icon of a guy snoring in his bed that I had just downloaded, but by now, the idea was creeping its way into the back of my mind, so I was somewhat beginning to suspect it. Not that I could check my phone to be sure. But still. The app had to do something. And it just looked sketchy as hell.\n\nSince there was no point in staying up since there was nothing to do, I just tried to go to sleep. Though since it was so early, I didn’t find it very easy to do that. I tried boring myself to sleep by watching the clock. It had some interesting qualities. For example, I noticed that the clock’s color definitely was changing over time. By 9:30, I knew for sure that the face of the clock had to have gotten redder than what it was when I first looked at it at 8:00. And I was able to tell since I also noticed that the redder the clock’s face got, the more it would glow in the dark. \n\nAt first, I honestly thought it looked pretty cool. I had never seen a clock do that before, so whoever had mysteriously given me a clock at least had the decency to give me a glow-in-the-dark one, which I thought was nice.  But with my room being pitch black and my only source of light being a clock whose face kept getting a deeper and deeper shade of red, and one that was slowly getting brighter and brighter at that, it legitimately started to get a bit spooky, I’m not gonna lie. \n\nAnother hour and a half later, it was 11:00 and if I wasn’t spooked before I definitely was by then. At around that time I had to seriously start questioning my own sanity. Because I thought for sure that I was beginning to see a human’s face in what was supposed to be a clock’s face behind the glass and the clock’s hands. Or at least vaguely human. I had read about how if you look in the mirror long enough in the dark, you start hallucinating faces that aren’t there. That must’ve been what was going on. Maybe the glass in front of the clock’s face was just reflective and acting like a mirror, and I was just looking at my own face. But that still didn’t explain why the clock was changing color. Or why it had gone from being just a normal clock to one that glowed in the dark. All without me pressing any buttons or really doing anything with it at all come to think about it.\n\nThere also wasn’t any reason I could find for why the face in the clock seemed to be getting more and more clear. Where before, I thought I might’ve just been seeing myself, the face got to the point where it was so clear, that there was no way it could’ve been me. By 11:45 I had been convinced this couldn’t be a hallucination. I know the whole point of hallucinations are supposed to be that they look real, but I’m sorry. This just looked too real to be in my head. By that time the clock had also gone a deep shade of total blood red. \n\nAnd the face almost seemed to be trying to escape from the clock. Like it was going to do something to me when it did. And let me tell you, this was not at all a pretty face.  I’d say it looked like death, but I get the feeling even death would be more attractive. It wasn’t smiling but it did seem to have an abnormally large mouth. In fact, it wasn’t even just the mouth. All the facial features, the eyes, nose, and mouth all seemed unnaturally large. They looked like they were growing and when the clock could no longer contain them, whatever was inside was gonna suddenly burst out. \n\nBut it was mainly the eyes that scared me. Most people have eyes that are white and have black pupils, but for this face it looked like the exact opposite with black irises and white pupils. The pupils also looked slender. Sort of vertical like what a cat’s might be. But it was more than just how different these eyes looked from regular eyes. Honestly, that was the least of my worries. It was the expression they had. I got the feeling that with each passing minute those eyes were just getting even more hate-filled and predatory than the last.\n\nBy 11:57, I had totally lost my shit. The color, the brightness, the clarity of the face, the size of the face, the look of hatred, all of it was coming to a head. I know this all probably sounds pretty stupid, but I was honestly more terrified than I could ever remember being up to that point. I just tucked my head under the covers and laid down totally flat, without moving a muscle.  This all must’ve been leading up to something that would happen at midnight. I didn’t know what that would be, and I was fighting for my fucking life not to find out. \n\nFor what must’ve been the next 3 minutes, I thought I was dead. Literally dead. Whatever demon was in that clock was just about to drag me straight down to hell. “So this is how I die” I told myself in my head since I was still too mortified to make a sound.  Not that it had felt like 3 minutes. But that made sense because, what with my whole-ass life flashing before my eyes, I’ll bet time probably would’ve had a way of seemingly slowing down. \n\nI heard it. I had heard a sound that sounded like glass shattering. The clock was broken. Whatever was in the clock had obviously come out by now. I heard it as it slithered and snaked its way around my room. “Just don’t move, just don’t fucking move. Whatever it is, it won’t know you’re there”, I told myself. I wouldn’t find out for another week or so just how right I was. Or at least, that I had been kind of right. It’s complicated. But at the time, the clock-demon or whatever the fuck kind of supernatural shit it was that was fucking with me, seemed to just randomly disappear. \n\nIt must’ve been at least a good fifteen minutes before I finally got the courage to stick my head out from under the covers and see what was going on. Nothing was there.  Not even the light from the clock. But that made sense to me given that it was  obviously broken by that point. I didn’t know why the thing in my clock left. But I was in no mood to question it. Just glad it was gone. I must’ve spent the rest of the time I was still awake that night, just praying to God that that never would happen again. Despite the fact that I was an atheist.",

        "author": "Asteroth6",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11ouczh/i_got_lost_in_the_woods_when_i_was_nine_years_old/",
        "text": "[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11n255w/i_got_lost_in_the_woods_when_i_was_nine_years_old/)\n\nI should say that I am sorry if my first two accounts felt uneventful. I feel that it was necessary to let you know how long I have suffered from this problem and how deeply it affected me. \n\nI woke up in that forest man, many more times over the course of my childhood and teenage years. The condition that triggered these nightmares was easy to identify: If I passed out—whether from exhaustion, a blow to the head, drugs, or any other means beyond ordinary sleep—I would find myself back in that place. \n\nOf course, this information helped me not at all beyond an extra incentive to fix my sleep habits. \n\nThere is no need to tell you about all of h to e dreams after those first three. Most of them resembled the first two more than the third. I was usually in the real glade, able to see the copse of trees I once desired to reach, and am chased by a single creature. Other variations did occur, however. Once, I found a burrow beneath the ground and followed it into a cave. Another time, a lake twinkled under the dim sunlight. \n\nI was always caught though. That never changed.\n\nBy the time I reached college, I was something of a wreck. I could still live a somewhat normal life, but the fear of this thing following me was never far from my mind. I had happy moments, but any time I got exhausted or otherwise risked passing out I would remember my fear of being back in those woods. \n\nStill, I consciously tried to push forward and be some kind of normal. I made friends. It wasn’t the traditional outcasts, but the potheads that proved to be the most accepting. I’ve learned that stoners have a high level of tolerance for social dysfunction. \n\nMy best friend, I’ll just call him Brad here, was the first person I tried to explain what was happening to. \n\n“You ever have recurring nightmares?” \n\nWe were hanging out the same way as usual. He smoked weed while we took turns with the controller on our preferred multiplayer FPS. \n\n It was pretty normal to just leap into random topics during such times, so just broaching that topic with no lead-in was not odd. \n\n“Uhh. Yeah. I guess. I don’t remember that kind of stuff well.”\n\n“I’ve had the weirdest one forever now.” I kept going. Yes, I know. I was the guy talking about my dreams. This weighed heavily on me though. I needed to just explain to someone in order to feel sane. “I wake up in the woods. But, it’s not like a dream. It’s like I’m actually waking up in the woods.” \n\n“Wait.” He clearly pieced something together while taking a hit. “Is this about that time you got lost? When you were six?”\n\n“Nine.” I corrected. “I was nine. But yeah, that was the one. The thing is, I never stopped having nightmares about that forest. I just… keep waking up there.” \n\n“That’s weird, man.” He said as he blew a cloud of smoke. \n\n“Nah. What’s really weird is that the dreams, they’re like, more real than this. Pain, itching, taste, smell. Everything is super real. And I know it, and I can think about it. But I don’t do much, because I’m six.” \n\n“Nine.” \n\n“Huh?”\n\n“I assume you’re like, nine in the dream.” He explained.\n\nI laughed, realizing how tired and second-hand high I was. \n\n“You think the dream might be real?” \n\nI was surprised that he actually stuck with the topic. Having gotten it off my chest I was willing to accept that I’d just bored my friend as the price of confession. \n\n“Yeah.” I nodded. It was a simple moment, but it was important to me. That was the first time I truly confronted, even to myself, the paranoid suspicion that had been growing in me. \n\n“What if I just passed out in there? What if this is all just some sort of weird dream between flashes of consciousness?” I poured out my worries.\n\n“Well, I know I’m here. So, for me, the question is answered. Doesn’t help you though, does it?” He chuckled. “Just go with it, bro. I mean, does it matter? If time isn’t really moving there, then you might at well be here, right?” \n\nI’m not sure the logic there was very good, but I supposed that he had already followed shockingly well while being so incredibly high. \n\n“It’s just… still being that little kid, stuck out there, it’s so messed up. I’m an adult. I’ve moved so far. I shouldn’t still be that child. But here I am, sooner or later I know I’m going to wake up as a lonely, frightened kid again.”\n\nI wasn’t sure my problem made any more sense, but it was the truth. \n\n“I dunno man.” He shrugged. “I guess you’re gonna have to find a way to fight it then.” \n\n-\n\nI didn’t, obviously. Life kept on moving. It was not long until I had the next incident though. \n\nOne of the perks of having even just some friends, and being in college was the relative ease of having some nominal dating life. I never had much success, but I did get a few short-lasting girlfriends. \n\nOne night found me heading home from a date during such time. Nothing that happened earlier in the evening stands out anymore, I could not begin to venture to recount how the date went, or what we did. All I know now is that I was heading home in the dark of the evening, tired but sober and aware. \n\n“I had a great time.” My date smiled at me. \n\nIt was an expected nicety, but always good to hear. \n\n“Me too.” I returned the smile.\n\nThe singular moment in time that followed would have been memorable under any conditions. It should have been just a ‘what could have been’ seared into my brain. A lesson in attentiveness remembered as a near disaster averted through good fortune. My “condition” has its own say in things though. \n\nAnother car chose to go for it and squeeze in a left turn across my path the moment I looked away. Oblivious to this, I wasn’t slowing down until I looked back. By that point, it was far too late to brake, if it ever would have been possible in time. Instead, I slammed the brakes and pulled left hard. The only blessing given me was a wide grassy meridian between opposing directions on that road, broken at several intervals for turns, such as the car in front of me was using. \n\nMy car hit the grass, instantly slowing me and simultaneously taking away any control of my direction. Then, we ramped back onto the lane between and finally back onto the grass. The car stopped when it hit the ditch running down the center of the grass at a sharply downward angle, jolting the car violently to rest. \n\nThe crash wasn’t severe, but I was still violently jolted.\n\nI jolted and tried to shake off the disorientating fog hanging over me. I knew I needed to do something. My body fumbled as I pushed myself up.\n\nI was in the woods. \n\nI needed to do something. I knew it. The enormity of the trees shrouded my purpose though, swallowed it up like so many dry leaves. \n\nI shook my head. There were lights, wheels. I could imagine fragments, but I couldn’t piece together the whole. \n\nEven still, I had so much more cognizance than usual. I will admit to liking to think that it was my conversation with Brad that helped push me to try to keep my head and solve things. \n\nI knew that I had been knocked out in a car. For once, I knew I wasn’t nine years old in those woods. But what to do with that knowledge?\n\nI had never gotten to explore that place with the sensibilities of an adult. What I had experienced, however, was enough to tell me it was a cursed place that I had no power over. \n\nI looked around me, mind still foggy but determined. The woods looked the same as always. I particularly looked ahead at the copse of trees that had long ago been my destination. I knew that something in those trees was behind this, or at least deeply important to it. \n\nI decided to try something largely at random. I closed my eyes and headed in that direction. \n\nIt was a game of feeling my way forward. I knew logically this would not do anything to stop being caught in a loop. Being in this kind of situation, however, requires accepting that ordinary logic no longer matters. You need to experiment and find an internal logic if even that exists.\n\nI was ready to try, at least. \n\nEvery time I lost sight of my target, I found myself reset. Perhaps if I never lost sight of it, the woods would let this hellish game move one step forward. \n\nAt first, my hands planted on roots and trunks. Then, I began to feel other things. Smooth and wet flesh, course, and matted hair all began to reveal themselves beneath my palm. I cannot say that I didn’t expect that. Nonetheless, I pushed forward. I knew what would happen if I opened my eyes. \n\nEventually, I did feel trees again, to either side of me, small and close.\n\nI was in the copse. \n\nMy eyes opened to see the forest looking normal still, just the little trees around me and the view seeing things from the spot I had never reached so long ago.\n\nThe little circle in the trees was, of course, well shaded. It felt warm and moist, just as the air had then. It almost looked and felt like a little cottage grown as a shelter by some woodland soul. \n\nA few things were sitting on the ground in the middle of it all.\n\nThey could easily have passed as forest debris to someone not looking, but I instantly understood their meaning. It was a good straight stick, with a few scraps wrapped around the base, and a pile of pine cones. That was exactly the sword a nine-year-old me would have made to defend his fort and the projectiles he would have thrown at attackers.\n\nFirst, my heart sank. Then, I felt a swelling rage. \n\n“Just let me go! I don’t want to be here! I don’t deserve to be here!” I screamed at the trees around me. \n\n“I grew up! I have a life!” I was shouting it as much to myself as to the woods. “And I was just a boy. I did nothing wrong! Why are you doing this to me?” \n\nThe woods don’t answer questions. They felt no debt was owed to me.\n\nAnd the things in the woods? They felt it was my debt to pay. \n\n“Just let me go!” I broke down to wailing. “Just let me go!”\n\n-\n\n“Just let me go!” \n\nI woke up in my car. The vehicle was essentially undamaged. The crash was little more than a bump. \n\nAnd I woke up incoherently screaming. \n\nDriving my date home was awkward. We never saw each other again. \n\nWhat really damaged me was finally accepting that any attempts at normalcy were futile. I was, and would always be, trapped in that place, and that could never be ignored.",

        "text": "Did you know you can make your wishlist on your xbox public?\n\nIt was the first time I had noticed the option, a couple of weeks ago. I guess it made sense, you can make your wishlist public and then anyone could look at it and buy you a game, as a gift or something.\n\nI am a lonely person who doesn’t really have any friends; I live with my mum in a three-story apartment, where I spend most of my time on the bottom floor, in my room playing video games on my Xbox One.\n\nSo, when I was bored and I was flicking through the Microsoft Store, I noticed the option to make my wishlist public and thought ‘Hey, why not?’\n\nIt was one of those small opening-up moments, where I think that I am making some first step to opening up to others and getting out of the isolated, cocoon room I called home, but in reality: I really wasn’t.\n\nI have almost always struggled to make friends and the last time I had anyone I considered a friend, I was still in secondary school. Now, I am in my early 20s and have no one outside of my family I could truly call a friend.\n\nThis isn't me opening up to the world or anything like that. This is me warning anyone who might read this.\n\nThen that was it, I simply made my wishlist public and I thought no more of it, why should it matter; no one would bother looking at it. And if anyone did, why would they care?\n\nThen, about a week later, out of the blue, I received a redeem code for one of the games on my wishlist from someone as a ‘gift’.\n\nIt was one of the £70 to £80 games on my wishlist, one of the ones which I was waiting to go on sale before buying: I am quite a cheapskate when it comes down to buying any games on xbox.\n\nThe gamertag was Fiend900, you know the usual gamertag of someone who just got their profile and hadn’t tailored their gamertag to their liking.\n\nI just assumed it was an accident and messaged back telling him that he accidentally gifted me a game for quite a lot of money.\n\nAlmost seconds later, he messaged me back simply “Take it.”\n\nNothing else, “Take it.” Like it was no big deal. Though looking back, I think it was more of a command than a ‘Here, take this.’\n\nWhat else could I do, there would have been no way that could have been a mistake. He literally told me to take it.\n\nFuck, I regret that! Maybe even more than making my wishlist public in the first place.\n\nAt the time, I assumed it was some kind of giveaway; like you see those streamers do – I don’t watch any streams or giveaway channels.\n\nI thought then that was it. Though it was worth making my wishlist public, it did get me a rather-of-my-budget game I wanted.\n\nBut then he just kept giving me games over the next few days.\n\nEven weirder, he would occasionally attach messages that criticised the games, or more specifically; me for playing those games.\n\nThey were quite creative criticisms, criticising the low-budget graphics, the repetitive gameplay and such.\n\nThough, they felt aimed at me.\n\nOne I can remember was like “Huh, you really like wasting your time on this long, boring game? Get a life!” or “Really, this game? Do you really expand your gaming experience with this one? There are so many games you already have that are like this one. Grow up!” I half expected him to swear in his messages, but I guess he can’t.\n\nWhen I was tired of his sarky remarks, I finally decided to message him back asking why he was being so judgemental of the games I played.\n\nHe replied “You are the one wishing for these games on your dumb little list. You are the one who chooses to waste your life on these fictional, fanboy games designed to drain your wallet. You are calling the shots! You should expect criticism!” or something like that.\n\nI couldn’t argue with him, of course. But, I was still confused why he was doing this in the first place. I asked him and he said he was just being nice. Said “Do you not want these games? I don’t understand. I was just being nice.”\n\nI also couldn’t argue with that; he bought me my games and I just accepted them without even a thank you. He felt too mean to thank, yet I couldn't help but feel he might be lonely. It’s strange to think that now, but I did back then.\n\nTo me, Fiend was just some lonely, rich kid who only wanted attention.\n\nWell, he had gotten his attention, but thinking this didn’t stop me from being upset by his retorts.\n\nI decided to look at his xbox profile. I was shocked to see nothing.\n\nHe had played no games, had no followers, no friends, no numerical gamerscore of playing anything, nothing. It was as though he just made the profile.\n\nLooking back, he must have made it about a week ago.\n\nI just felt bad for him, perhaps I shouldn’t have, he could have made the profile just to mess with me somehow or even go as far as scam me in some way. But, I couldn’t help but feel he was some new kid who hadn’t made any friends where he lived and had just discovered xbox for the first time ever.\n\nWhat else could I think?\n\nAnother week passed, and Fiend had bought me all of the games on my wishlist.\n\nHe must’ve spent about £300. I mean, none of the games he got me were on sale at the time. Who does this? But, if I am being completely honest; I did not question it at all. I wish I did.\n\nI was going to try and thank him in some sort of way, I was going to ask whether he wanted to play a game with me. Not any he had gifted me, he didn’t have any, he didn’t seem to like them and they are mainly single-player games anyway.\n\nSo, I was going to ask whether he would want to play Overwatch 2 or maybe I could reinstall Fortnite; a game he can play for free.\n\nBut then as I was composing the message – like he knew what I was doing – he messaged me.\n\nIt was the weirdest message so far and I don’t think I will ever forget it. It simply read “I have given you what you value. Now, you owe me…”\n\nI was like “What the actual fuck!” The message was so different from any other messages he had sent me: “You owe me…” What did that mean?\n\nSo, I replied “I’m sorry, I didn’t realise you wanted something in return. Perhaps, you could refund some of the games you have given me.” I was trying to sound formal and polite, I had stumbled into something deeper than I had thought and he was clearly agitated. Though he couldn’t refund most of the earlier games he had given me, because I had already redeemed them, he could still refund some of the later games; the 2 or 3 I hadn’t redeemed yet.\n\nLittle did I know then, the next message was even weirder. He said, “No, you belong to me!”\n\nI chuckled at this one, it sounded oddly sexual.\n\nHe had the wrong impression of me, so I messaged “Ok, I don’t know what you are thinking, but I am not interested in you in that way. I don’t even know who you are. I’m sorry.” I did realise how harsh that sounded, but I had to stand up for myself in a mature and adult fashion, he couldn't treat me like this.\n\nHe repeated, “You belong to me.” Was he not getting the message?\n\n“Listen, you seem like a nice person, but I do not know you. I am sorry.”\n\n“You belong to me.”\n\n“That's enough, stop it! Or I am going to block you!”\n\n“You belong to me.”\n\nIt was getting creepy. No matter what I messaged, he would just say “You belong to me.”\n\nSo, I blocked him.\n\nThough, it did seem to take a while, not sure why; but my console was whirling noisily and getting very hot. Like when it boots up a demanding game. I ignored it.\n\nThen, I reported him and simply said he was being creepy and toxic.\n\nI moved on and that was that, at least for the rest of that day.\n\nI will remember the next day until I die.\n\nThat morning was on a weekday, so I had to get up early in the morning to go to work. I get up at 6 a.m. and I am always the first to wake in the apartment. I did what I do every morning: I cleaned my teeth, got dressed and got ready to go.\n\nI noticed I had left my xbox on overnight. I don’t think I had ever done that before, but it didn’t matter. I turned it off.\n\nBefore I leave every morning, I would open the blinds. Not to see anything, but so we, me and my mum, don’t look anti-social to people passing by. Though that morning, I did see something.\n\nIt was only there for a split second, yet I could have sworn I saw a naked, pale figure on the other side of the road, dashing off out of view. It was like it was trying not to be seen by me, like it was looking over and, as though it somehow knew I was opening the blinds, it ran off.\n\nSo when I saw it, I gasped and a second later looked down the road to see who it was.\n\nOutside our apartment, you can see across the road with the only closest turn off the pathway on the opposite side being about 10 metres away.\n\nIt was gone. Somehow, it got out of sight within a single second.\n\nWhether or not it turned around that corner to get out of sight, I will never know; there was nowhere else it could have gone.\n\nThough it made me jump at the time, I had to move on with my day. So, I chalked it up to a jogger running past – they do that in my town early in the morning – or my imagination and I moved on, forgetting all about it.\n\nWell, I didn’t forget about it. How could I? I had never seen anything like it before. It didn’t help that at work, I was listening to horror podcasts; most of which had pale, figured cryptids in them.\n\nOn my way home, I had that really strong feeling that someone, or something, was following me.\n\nThis wasn’t uncommon for me; when it was dark and uncrowded, but it was broad daylight and in the centre of the town market.\n\nIt’s not like I saw anything to give me that feeling, I just had that feeling.\n\nI got home and once again my xbox was on. I distinctly remembered turning it off this time.\n\nPerhaps, something brushed past the power button and turned it on. Like any Xbox One or 360, that happens from time to time. But, what could’ve brushed up against the button; my mum doesn’t go into my room without my knowledge, at least I strongly believe that she doesn’t. Nothing could have stirred in my room enough to power on my console by accident.\n\nThis reminded me of Fiend and our last chat. This was the first time I connected the strange figure from that morning to Fiend, though the idea that they were connected stressed me out too much to seriously consider.\n\nI powered down my console and unplugged it.\n\nNothing felt wrong again until about 10 o'clock, I was watching Youtube on my laptop.\n\nMarkiplier was doing one of his ‘it's behind you bits’ in a ‘3 Scary Games’ video: the cheesy, stupid humour that keeps me working all day.\n\nYet, I couldn't shake the feeling. Something felt like it was behind me.\n\nLike, maybe the room got colder by half a degree or I could faintly smell the salt of someone sweating in the room. I honestly don’t know. I could just feel it. Like when something has been removed from your room, even though you weren’t even conscious of that thing being there in the first place, and yet, you can just tell something is missing.\n\nI spent the next half an hour looking at the screen for a minute or two and then glancing behind myself, seeing nothing.\n\nEventually, I paused the video I was watching and surveyed my room from my chair; spinning as a satellite dish would.\n\nI think it was only for about 10 seconds, though it felt a lot longer. Looking and looking again to confirm and reconfirm that I was alone in my room. I even closed my eyes occasionally to try and hear anything in my room.\n\nWhen I was satisfied, I turned back to my screen.\n\nIt was right there, right behind me!\n\nOff the reflection of the darker side of my laptop screen, in the corner of my eye!\n\nSaved as a screenshot in my brain forever – the same being looking in through my window that morning – drifting out of view.\n\nFrom what I could see more clearly this time, it wasn’t human.\n\nThe skin was far too pale, more the skin of a corpse than anything else. Not that it was a corpse, in any sense, it was just the skin wrapped so tightly around its frame. Like a Skinwalker would wear the skin of a person, yet this thing's skin was wrapped so tightly around its bones, that it had to have been the skin of somebody half its size.\n\nIt was naked, as it was before, and roughly the same size as me: though extremely slender and dangerously underweight.\n\nThat's all I could say about it. I only saw its mid-section: torso and arms, but I think my mind would break if it saw anything else.\n\nI don’t exactly know how I reacted.\n\nI saw it only a moment longer than last time and was choking on a bit of saliva at the back of my throat. My hands were desperately trying to find my chair's armrests to strangle and my legs were desperately trying to skid my chair away across the wooden, glossy floor.\n\nOnly a second passed until I could swallow and finally scream.\n\nYet, my scream only lasted 1 or 2 seconds, before my eyes started darting around the room to try and find it again.\n\nAnd once more it was gone. Vanished completely from sight!\n\nHow could it just vanish when the direction it was moving in was towards the back of my room? Where did it go? Where could it go?\n\nI found myself glancing at the xbox, yet this time it was off.\n\nBut, the feeling couldn’t elude me, that it was on and it just soundlessly turned itself off upon me looking at it. Like, when I was scanning my room; it was on in the background and I was too distracted by whatever else was in my room to notice it.\n\nI didn’t know what else to do, but I had to catch my breath and steady my heartbeat; they were both running at 1000%.\n\nI thought for quite some time, maybe an hour or so, I don’t know. I decided I should call it a day and I went to bed, hoping my dreams would let me escape my hellish hallucinations. That's all I hoped they were: hellish hallucinations.\n\n*Do ding!*\n\nThe sound of my console turning itself on woke me up. I didn’t budge much at first, I was still half asleep.\n\n*Do doo!*\n\nThe sound of my console turning itself off. This time I opened my eyes.\n\nIt was pitch black and I had no inkling of the time. And I mean pitch black; my TV didn’t have its standby light on, my other console's supply bricks were dead and anything that could admit any light was consumed by the darkness.\n\n*Do ding!*\n\nThe light from the console was the only light which had power, even though it was unplugged. It came back on after about 10 seconds.\n\n*Do doo!*\n\nIt turned off again after the same amount of time and the room went back to black. With nothing else to focus on, I focused my eyes on the corner of my room.\n\n*Do ding!*\n\nI noticed some movement in the corner. Like when you look out into the darkness and it looks like something is moving there, but then you notice nothing is moving there at all.\n\n*Do doo!*\n\nFocussing harder, it still looked that way. No matter how hard I would focus, the corner still looked occupied by something.\n\n*Do ding!*\n\nWait. Something looked as though it was coming out towards me; a figure. So faint, yet so present.\n\n*Do doo!*\n\nI tried to move, panicked now. For some reason, I couldn’t.\n\nWas this sleep paralysis? I had never experienced sleep paralysis before then, but people can hallucinate things when having sleep paralysis.\n\nThis was sleep paralysis, wasn’t it? Or was I scared stiff? I slammed my eyes shut and put my whole body weight onto them.\n\n*Do ding!*\n\nI was sure that thing was in front of me now, if I had opened my eyes I would finally realise my delusions. Yet, I couldn’t out of sheer fear.\n\nI just tried to sleep instead, to escape into my world of dreams. Any nightmare I could conjure would have been better than this.\n\n*Do doo! Do ding! Do doo! Do ding!*\n\nI have no idea how many repetitions of that sound went by before I would open my eyes again. The sound which I would usually get a dopamine release every time I heard it, was then and will now and forever be just as daunting a noise as death's bell.\n\nI had to face it. I opened my eyes.\n\n*Do ding!*\n\nNothing.\n\nMy console was still on, but there was nothing I could see. The repeating sound of my console had stopped.\n\nIt felt like I could finally breathe a fresh sigh of relief. That moment of joy was as blissful as water in a desert.\n\nIt was over until it wasn’t.\n\nI felt it first at my feet, every nerve in my body was operating far above what was normal. The press against the foot of my bed, that of something leaning on it. Then, it stepped onto the mattress making the air within audibly gush very quietly. It felt like footsteps walking the length of the bed, just behind where I lay. It was so light, the same weight of shoes gently placed on the bed. Impossibly sparse for how big the entity was. Though, the thudding of its steps was still audible, only just.\n\n*Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!*\n\nIt stopped at the head of the bed for a second, before finally slinking down into a lying position just behind me, forbidding any physical contact with me by only a few inches.\n\nMy heart was leaping from my chest.\n\nBut, then I could feel its breathing. It was heavy, like a pig in heat. I could feel the moisture from its breath settle on the nape of my neck and the strands of what I believed to be its thin hair whip softly against the new damp spot. Yet, once more, it sounded so quiet; so impossibly quiet for how heavy its breathing was.\n\nThough throughout this, I still could not move; proving it was fear I was under the power of, not mere sleep paralysis. My body had locked itself in place like my joints were filled with cement.\n\nTime passed before it was whispering something. I couldn’t hear what it was saying at first, its voice was so soft and silent.\n\nIt was repeating something. My name. Every word sharpened its unseen tongue again and again. Sharper and sharper and sharper and sharper.\n\nThen finally, it spat out slowly: “You, owe, me… You belong to me!”\n\n*‘Do doo!’*\n\nThe room fell still, just as it should have been, in a single instant.\n\nThe unplugged console was off and all the other standby lights had power again, giving the room a light, artificial glow.\n\nI couldn’t say how my body was; it had unlocked itself, but all my organs and joints felt weak.\n\nI felt the covers behind me: it was gone.\n\nI don’t know how I slept after that, but I can say I most likely passed out.\n\nThe next morning, I told work I felt a bit too ill to come in. That wasn’t entirely false.\n\nI knew I had to do something, this ‘entity’ wasn’t going away.\n\nSo, I started with the obvious and considered calling the police. I would have told them that something was stalking me and that it had gotten into my room somehow, got into bed with me and left without leaving any trace of its presents behind.\n\nOh, and that it was a fourth-dimensional pervert. That would have gotten me a nice, warm bed in the loonie bin.\n\nI considered telling mum, but though she is more likely to believe me, I don’t want her to get involved. I have no idea how this thing operates.\n\nSo, I decided that I need to know more about this thing.\n\nI plugged my xbox back in and looked for Fiend or who I believed was my invader from last night.\n\nI did expect I wouldn’t find anything new, but the profile was gone.\n\nNo, not deleted, just outright gone.\n\nThe chats I had with Fiend, the redeem codes I had gotten from him, the fact I reported/blocked his profile, all of it: gone.\n\nI still had the games from Fiend, but that was it.\n\nSo, I gave up on that idea and tried searching google for this entity.\n\nThis was also a dead-end however, I couldn’t find any demons who operate like this being or any mythical creatures that capture humans through Xbox Live. I tried cryptids and, well let's just say there are more pale, slender cryptids than I thought on the internet.\n\nMaybe, it was how I was researching this thing? Though, I don’t know how to search the internet for anything like this in the first place.\n\nI have had no luck finding anything out about this entity.\n\nBut, maybe I could evade this thing? Perhaps, I could get far enough away from my console to lose it? It may have found me at work, but maybe it has a range limit.\n\nThough, this was assuming it is tied down to my console somehow. And I don’t think I have it in me to run away; I would have to disappear, change my name and everything that makes me who I am. I don’t think I could make my mum go through that.\n\nI was running out of ideas. The best one I had was going back onto my xbox to find out more about Fiend. That idea was going in the right direction but I needed a new lead.\n\nThen I thought, maybe Microsoft could help me. I called their customer service line.\n\nFrom what I could find out from them: you can't delete an xbox profile; only change your gamertag, profiles don’t just disappear and that my story was crazy and I should be contacting the police or someone I knew who could ‘help’ me.\n\nThough, when I was about to throw in the towel and hang up, the young woman who I was speaking to said something sympathetically along the lines of “Look, have you shared your wishlist with anyone?”\n\nI told her no and said, “I saw the option, but I had no reason to select it.”\n\n“Well, then I know your story is false,” she replied, sounding more hopeful. “If this person was giving you games, then they would be doing it blindly. Even if you made your wishlist public, no one should be able to see it unless you shared it with someone else before.”\n\n“What?” I asked. “What do you mean?”\n\n“I had this issue with one of my friends before. The option should be left of the ‘settings’ option on your wishlist. When you select this and you have set your wishlist to ‘public’, then it should give you the option to share your wishlist with other people. Otherwise, no one should be able to view it.”\n\nI froze when she said this. My mind was a mess. If what she said was true; then everything I had experienced up until then was supposed to be impossible.\n\n“H-hello?” she spoke through the phone after I didn’t respond.\n\nAll I could do at that moment was tell her I had to go and hang up the phone.\n\nI looked over at my console and I was fairly sure it was looking back at me. Whatever I provoked, it was because of my xbox: it had found me.\n\nI saw red. I picked up the console and as hard as I could, I threw it down. It smashed into the hard ground and I went to pick it up again and I threw it again and again and again. I did this until it looked more like a wrecked car than an Xbox One.\n\nI then opened the door to my closet and dumped it on the hard closet floor. I did feel a pang of pain because I did enjoy playing games on it. But, I felt this had to be done.\n\nAfter that, I gave up and started writing this.\n\nI don’t know what to conclude; I didn’t learn anything from this.\n\nSomething found my wishlist on my xbox – through some unknown means, I cannot say how; it could have hacked me for all I know –, bought me the games on it and started to stalk me.\n\nWhat it is, I can only guess it came from somewhere beyond our reality and does not follow the same logic as we do.\n\nIt came looking for somebody, maybe specifically me. Maybe I have something it wants.\n\nThough I don’t know what it wants with me, I can say it does not have good intentions. That I can be sure of.\n\nI do think, however, this thing somehow bought me with the games it gave me. It gave me those games knowing I would take them without question and when I did, this thing found me.\n\nIf I didn’t take those games, maybe it wouldn't have found me. Maybe, it doesn’t matter; maybe it would find me anyway.\n\nPlease, whatever you do, do not make this same mistake.\n\nThis happened to me, but this could still happen to anyone else.\n\nMaybe my situation is unique. Even if this is the case, supernatural or not, there will be someone out there that will want to use you. Someone with ill intentions that, if he ever gets the chance, will try to manipulate you. Offer you gifts, which you take without even meeting them first, and then that person will start demanding things from you; favours, money, influence or even your very body.\n\nThe kindness of strangers cannot be blindly trusted, because they may want something in return.\n\nIf only I had the chance to go out and socialise. Well, I did, but I didn’t take it. And that just led me to this point.\n\nPerhaps, you can’t trust the kindness of strangers, but you could still go out into the world and meet people who you can trust. People who like you and respect who you are. People who you can see in the flesh and don’t ask for anything in return.\n\nBecause, when you get to know a person, they stop being a stranger. I just hope you have the strength I never had. I think it's too late for me.\n\nI can hear my console power up from my closet. Despite the fact it doesn’t look like an Xbox One anymore; it apparently still works fine.\n\nListen to this at least; if you can find someone on xbox with the gamertag Fiend900, then get away from it; it is not human and will only mean you ill will.\n\nI think it is calling to me. I must face it, I don’t know why but I feel like I need to face it. I don’t think I could live with myself if I didn’t.\n\nI’ve got to go.",

        "text": "A few days after my thirtieth birthday, I saved the life of a blue jay, scaring my cat away at a crucial moment. Grateful, the bird granted me a wish. Unfortunately, the jay was also impatient and only gave me fifteen seconds to decide. \n\n“I’ve always wanted to be smaller,” I said, and it was true. As 6’6 woman, I’m constantly met with gawking stares and reminders that the world isn’t built for me. Clothes don’t fit, cars are too small, and the only men who want to date me are fetishists. \n\n“Yep!” said the blue jay before flying off to look for worms. \n\nThe next day, I woke up, and I was 5’8. Getting in the car was awesome. It felt like I’d boarded a plane and been upgraded to first class. No one on the street even looked at me. I headed to Macy’s and bought a whole new wardrobe. Everything fit right off the rack. \n\nI swept out the doors, my arms laden with shopping bags, and had to stop myself from bursting into song.\n\nThe next morning I was 4’5. None of my new clothes fit. Outside, people were staring again. I couldn’t reach the pedals of my car. I ran out to my yard and screamed at the blue jay, but it just startled away. Maybe it wasn’t even the same bird. \n\nI went inside and cried and watched TV. All day, the blanket seemed bigger and bigger, and when I measured myself just before bedtime, I was three foot two.\n\nThe next morning, I was no more than a foot tall. Getting out of bed was terrifying. I clung to the fitted sheet and I rappelled down the side of the mattress and finally landed in a heap on the floor. \n\nI stole clothes from an old Barbie my niece had left in my office and headed out the cat door. Outside, I yelled at the birds again, and they looked at me hungrily.\n\n“Why would you do this to me?” I shouted. “I saved you.”\n\nA blue jay fluttered down and examined me.\n\n“Are. You. Mouse?” it asked. “You. Funny.”\n\nAnd I realized the bird wasn’t malicious. It was an idiot. \n\n“Please,” I said. “Can’t you undo the wish?”\n\n“Worm!” shouted the bird, and it flew off to fight over a piece of rope with another jay.\n\nBy the end of the day, I was less than an inch tall. For the first time, fear truly set in. I would only keep getting smaller. Perhaps I would eventually disappear. Or perhaps there was no such thing as disappearing. \n\nPerhaps you could grow smaller and smaller infinitely. I wasn’t sure. But I knew that as far as my old life was concerned, I was basically dead, a tiny ghost walking the world unnoticed. \n\nThat night, I tried to sleep in the warmth of a paper napkin I’d dropped a few days earlier, shaking with cold and fear, wondering what the morning would bring.\n\nIt became difficult to tell how small I’d grown by the next day. I only knew the fibers of the paper towel stretched out like a thick, massive spiderweb that stretched out in all directions. \n\nAround me, I now sensed the movements of terrifying mites that towered over me like great eldritch beasts. They examined me with their greedy eyes, and opened their mouths to reveal teeth sharper than fine hairs. I could imagine them cutting my body into pieces finer than glass dust. And I ran, covering inches in hours, screaming that I didn’t want to die.\n\nSoon, I was stepping past impossible viruses whose wiggling hairlike tentacles flopped at random, threatening to break my skin with the faintest contact. The universe no longer seemed to be in order but was breaking down to chaos. Nothing had a mind but merely moved. I began to sense the wavelengths of light as having true width. Soon, they were longer than my body.\n\nMy mind began to untangle as I realized I had been a knot before. It was as if the intricate folds of my brain were being pulled taught to become an infinite string. I would have shaken with terror, but my body was not as it had once been. I was something not quite human now.\n\nAnd then the world became empty. The distance between all things seemed to become infinite, though at times the air buzzed with the humming of electrons, or perhaps something else, unknowable.\n\nI grew ready to disappear. I’d never believed in anything, but now I’d witnessed a feckless bird with unimaginable power. Perhaps I should have called to it. Instead, oddly, I found myself praying to myself. And then my voice disappeared in the hum of all things.\n\nBut when I should have blinked away, I instead felt a new heaviness inside. I looked at my fingers and saw myself adorned with infinite rings, and where rubies and sapphires might have set, instead I saw red giants and black holes. Whole galaxies were moles and scars along my arms.\n\nBut I kept shrinking. Soon the largest star adorning me was our own small sun, and then it too was gone, replaced with gas giants, then smaller, rocky worlds.\n\nOn my sixth day shrinking, I was the sky. \n\nAnd then on the seventh, I woke in my own bed.\n\nAs I sat up, my cat pounced up on my feet, dropping a mangled blue jay onto the comforter.\n\n“Good girl,” I said, giving her a small rub with [my large, ugly hand.](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/)",

        "text": "As i walk in my mind is alarmingly trying to find the answer for two pressing questions, one : how did my deaf grandfather hear me knocking on the door? Two : WHERE IS THE HOUSEKEEPER?\n\nI hugged my grandpa while feeling uneasy, and tried to smile back at him , he brought out his notebook and wrote something hastily; his hands shaking a little bit as he's writing what he wants to say , i took a seat and then grabbed my own notebook and started to write a question, but i stopped in my tracks when he tossed his notebook to me and i started to read what he had just written on the top of the page , and that's when i knew something was wrong for sure because... that's not my grandfather's writing...he doesn't use uppercase letters and-\n\n\nOh\nOh my God\n\nWAS HE USING HIS LEFT HAND? \n\nBut he's NOT left handed!!! \n\n\"MY HOUSEKEEPER CALLED IN SICK TODAY THAT'S WHY SHE'S NOT HERE \"\n\nWhat was written doesn't make any sense because , the housekeeper is a man ..why did he write \"HER\" ..? Who is this man exactly? And where's my grandpa? Where's the housekeeper? \n\n\nShould i start running away or is this my grandpa but he's starting to lose his mind? What's going on? \n\nA sudden realization occurred to me and i felt stupid, today is Sunday..the housekeeper isn't supposed to show up today and that's why he's not here ... but that means this man in front of me is not my grandpa, he doesn't know his schedule and that he's a man \n\nI rose to my feet while my eyes were locked on the door , I really hope it's open and i can withdraw safely.. please God.. please let me escape\n\nThe man noticed my sudden movement and smiled in a sinister way, and that's when i noticed his front teeth are not crooked like my grandfather's, a shiver ran down my spine as i stood frozen in place , i couldn't move any further while he started advancing towards me and taking slow calculated steps towards me while holding a strange looking necklace with a pendant that looked like a clock .\n\nI couldn't look away from it and that was the last thing i saw after i dropped to the ground unconscious.\n\nI woke up feeling dizzy and i was at my house again, except that there's something strange about my room ..the wallpaper.. this bluish wallpaper isn't supposed to be here at all .\n\nThis wallpaper was replaced with a lilac one about 10 years ago, and the bed! \n\nThd bed i was laying in was very small and uncomfortable, i changed it 10 years ago then why-\n\nAm i ? Am i back in time? \n\n\nI rose to my feet panicking not understanding what was going on anymore, i opened my room's door and that's when i felt something wet and warm on my feet , i took a step back and screamed but then i saw what it was- \n\nOH MY GOD \n\nIsn't this Koy? My dog that passed away 4 years ago? Why..why is he alive again? \n\nTears started to well up as i took him in my arms while he started licking my face eagerly, I'm so scared right now but I can't stop myself from crying, i missed Koy so much and seeing him again has paralysed my mind , I can't stand up again and I can't find it in myself to ask any more questions.. I don't know what's happening but I'll spend at least 5 minutes With Koy before all of this disappears.\n\nKoy gets up from my lap and start walking towards the corridor, i rose to my feet and started walking after him , he excitedly started jumping down the stairs and i cautiously followed him downstairs while looking at my house looking unchanged from how it was 10 years ago , if this is 2013 again then my parents aren't supposed to be home and both are working, at that time i was being homeschooled and my teacher shows up everyday at 3pm .\n\nI took a look at the giant clock at the centre of the living room and it was 9 am , none of this makes sense... The only explanation is that man brought me back in time but how am i supposed to take it as an answer to what's happening right now? How is any of this possible? \n\nWhat am i supposed to do now? \n\nI tried reaching out in my pocket to see if my phone was with me and thank God it was, i turned it on and was relieved to see that the lockscreen didn't change, it was a picture of me and my family at the 2023 new years eve festival, I typed in the password and  started to check if there was any calls from anyone , dread started to fill me when the phone started glitching , and then a strange number showed up on my screen ... wait who is this? Should i answer? \n\n\" Hello ? Who's with me?\" I said in a shaking tone \n\n\" We're   Angels Daycare ,You  haven't shown up for  the past 2 weeks , you could've at least called in sick or handed us your resignation letter, this is such an irresponsible behaviour, you're fired\"\n\n\"I'm sorry what-\" \nAnd the call ended just like that \n\nI've never... worked in a Daycare center.. what in fresh hell is going in here? When will the prankster arrive and tell me it was a sick twisted joke? \n\n\nDid my future timeline somehow change? But of my profession changed then what else did change while i was gone? \n\nI typed in my mother's number praying she would answer.\n\n\nShe didn't.\n\n\nI tried calling my dad right after but to add to my disappointment he also didn't answer my call , alright now what? \n\nI called the Daycare center back , maybe they know something about future me ? \n\nAs i was waiting i jumped from my seat they answered \" we have made it clear that you're no longer hired, what do you want? \" \n\n\" Ok I'm sorry but PLEASE don't hang up , I'm really stuck in an unfortunate situation right but can you please tell me about myself? I know this sounds but for how long was i hired at your center?\" \n\n\nA sigh and then the same tired voice answered rather less rudely than before \" alright i don't know what's going with but I'll tell you that you've been hired for at least two years now, you've never ghosted us like so I'm really surprised and disappointed that you did this, were you dealing with any health issues?  \"\n\n\" No- i .. I don't know what to tell you I'm really in a situation that i can't even explain, my parents are worried sick about me and I can't even reach out to them \" \n\n\" Your parents? they've been dead for years now am i missing something? \" \n\n\nMy heart skipped a beat and the phone dropped to the ground\n\n\nthey .have. been.dead.for years.now \n\n\nWhen? How did this happen? But i didn't do anything in this timeline to affect my future this much then why did it change completely? \n\n\nWait is this why they don't answer their phone? Are they alive in this timeline or dead? Or\n\n\nOr\n\nOr they're about to die , maybe this is the day they will die in \n\nIs this is why I'm here? \n\n\n\nPart [1] Ended",

        "text": "I was in my house sleeping until there was a big earthquake from which I got up, I went to a window but there was nothing, the earthquake stopped out of nowhere, however it was normal sometimes for this type of thing to happen, then I went another go to sleep, then I got ready to go to work, which was a bit far from my home, but the distance didn't matter much to me, besides that I lived alone and my family had an accident where only I survived, well, when I went to my work I observed how a man was hiding in the trees, obviously I did not give it much importance since I thought he was looking for something although his look at me was trying to tell me something very important, I continued on my way to my work\n\nAfter finishing I was going back to my house but oh, I found the same man in the same place and he was still hiding in the trees with his gaze fixed on me, I felt uncomfortable and I walked a little faster to my house, the man began to chase me hidden behind the trees, then I noticed that one of his hands was shining and the other too, which I ran faster since I thought it was some kind of weapon like a sharp knife or something like that, my imagination wasn't very aware of that, then Upon arriving at my house, I immediately closed all the doors, windows and everything that has an escape or entrance to the outside with the suspicion that the man was still there, luckily it seems that he did. The day after it was Sunday and I had free time, I was afraid because my mind wouldn't stop thinking about that man and I stayed at home, luckily I didn't have much to do so I started watching movies with the doors closed so that absolutely no one entered, but the man appeared again, I don't know how he did it or if he got a key the same as mine since I had the original ones and he apparently had new ones, the man took off the cloak that hid it and from there A completely white being came out, I did not know how to react to the fact that a presence was in my house, the being put his right hand on my head and grabbed my right hand with his left and told me;\n\n\"Hello, do not be afraid, my son, I am your creator\"\n\nI did not know how to react and I was paralyzed, although I managed to calm down since I deduced, if it has not attacked me, then apparently it is, the being presented itself as God, I was left stunned. that he had the being that created everything in my own and same house, then he told me that he will no longer be able to fulfill his deeds and that I must possess his powers and make reality more perfect indicating that I am the new god, He told me that he had enough courage to control Heaven, Reality and, more likely, Hell, I told him that i could not do it and that I am alone without anyone, God exclaimed that it did not matter since he was alone since his creation and from to see what he did now not to be besides that I would be with my family who all died long ago already as I said, I kept denying him since it was too much to ask for but God said that\n\n\"there is never enough to have it all son\"\n\nFinally he told me that simply I could leave things as they are now, there was no need to worry if there were bigger problems, I would just solve them and everything will be fun for me, and then he gave his essence to me, falling his arms in my arms saying\n\"you can!\"\nalready like this leaving control of everything in my hands\n\nI spent a while processing what had happened and at the end of the day I went to a ravine to see if what happened was real and when I closed my eyes and jumped in, I said; I can't believe it, I had landed on my feet and without any problem, after understanding what I had to protect from now on, I looked towards the sun observing one of the biggest stars of life and thus I began to take care of reality and the sky creating new human systems and improving them a little with more physical capacities in which they cannot harm many people, and thus I obtained the knowledge of the concepts of my essence and discovered the infinite and great universes which God had mentioned before that I should take care of , so I decided and thus improve the entire existence of these universes by adding what a single being needs, friends and family, thus eliminating bad tastes and that the poor were no longer like this, creating a perfect existence, thus being a new god.",

        "text": "There’s more ways than one to get lost on the backroads out there. I almost found that out the hard way.\n\nI was with my college sweetheart at the time, Lisa. We both had a few years in the workforce after graduating and we were already burnt out. If there was a Resilience 101 course in college we would have failed spectacularly. She was working as an accountant at the time and I had just quit my job as a structural engineer.\n\n“You know what would cheer us up?”\n\n“Never having to work again?”\n\n“The great American road trip!”\n\nI agreed to it, of course. It seemed like a good idea. I mean how many people don’t dream about driving across the United States in an open car.\n\nWe were barely out of Sacramento when we reached the edge of the Mojave. I’d actually never had driven out of the state up to that point so I was lost. I stopped at an isolated gas station. I told Lisa that I needed to use the restroom but it was really because I had no idea where we were going.\n\nI got out the car and told Lisa I was going to the restroom. But I walked behind the station where the men’s bathroom was and whipped out my phone.\n\nI couldn’t let Lisa know that I got us lost. I had no job, I couldn’t let her know I was so hopeless that we were lost in this day and age.\n\nI looked down at the bars.\n\nEmpty. There was no reception out there. We really were lost.\n\nI went inside to buy water…but really to ask for directions. There was only one person there, a balding middle-aged man reading one of the magazines of the stand. It was a small gas station, one fridge for bottled water and coke, two, even you want to be generous, ‘aisles’ full of corn chips and bags of nuts. Suffice to say, the gas station only made its money from desperate travellers on an empty tank.\n\nI handed over the cash and in my best casual tone I went, “So you wouldn’t know the roads to Tucson would you?”\n\nThe gas attendant smirked.\n\n“Lost huh? No phone reception?”\n\n“You’d think in this day and age right?”\n\nHe smirked again. “Go about fifty miles straight ahead and take the right on the fork. You’ll go down off the highway but it’s a shortcut to Tucson. Keep going straight from twenty miles and you’ll join the highway again. Saves you six hours.”\n\n“Thanks mister.”\n\nI hopped back into the car and checked Lisa’s legs resting on the dashboard. Damn I was a lucky bastard.\n\n“You got lost and asked for directions didn’t you?”\n\n*She had seen right through me.*\n\n“I tried my phone first.”\n\n“I couldn’t get reception either. So where we headed?”\n\n“Fifty miles straight and then right on the fork.”\n\n“Ride on cowboy.”\n\nI have to admit, Lisa was right making me go on this trip. With the wind blowing through our hair, the vistas on the horizon, it made me feel like we were carefree and back in college.\n\nWe finally reached the fork.\n\n“Right?” Lisa said.\n\n“Right.”\n\nWe turned right and the cactus-filled desert actually started to be filled with trees and shrubs. A few miles on and there was tall grass on either side of the road. I guess cacti weren’t the only things growing out here. \n\nA few more miles and we turned a corner. It was just sixty yards ahead before I screeched to a stop. There was a car across the road and what looked like two bodies out on the road. Just laying there.\n\n“I think there dead” Lisa said covering her mouth in horror.\n\nI leaned over the dashboard as if the few extra inches was supposed to provide more clarity.\n\n“Should we call an ambulance?” I asked Lisa.\n\n“Of course we should.” She whipped out her phone. “Shit.” She said. “Still no reception.”\n\nShe dropped her phone and turned to me. “We have to go help them. We can’t just leave them there.”\n\n“Yeah of course, right.” I started the car again and only went a few yards before I stopped.\n\nI looked at the road ahead of us. There was the two bodies, the car across both lanes of the road, and long tall grass on either side.\n\nBut there was no signs of an accident. The car was in perfect shape. No shattered glass. Even though we were sixty yards away the bodies didn’t look mangled or bloody.\n\nI just stared.\n\n“What are you doing? Drive! We have to help them.” Lisa was almost hysterical.\n\nI just kept staring. I had the worst feeling.\n\n“Doesn’t this seem strange to you?” I asked Lisa.\n\nTo this day, she has never given me as filthy a look as she did that day.\n\n“The only thing that is strange, is that you’re not driving.”\n\n“But how did they get there? They’re car doesn’t look damaged, it’s almost like it’s blocking the road. I’d have to partially go off the road to get around it.”\n\nShe was almost incredulous now. “Then don’t drive around them. Help them.”\n\n“Lisa, I’m going to drive slowly around them, I’ll get on the other side, and if everything is okay we’ll get out and help.”\n\n“That has to be the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard.”\n\nWe stared at each other in silence for a few moments before I turned on the car again. I kept the car at a really slow speed.\n\nForty yards away. The scene came into better view. There may have been a few scratches on the car but it definitely wasn’t damaged.\n\nWhen we were twenty yards away I saw no glass. Nothing. Just two perfectly healthy bodies lying on the road, a man and a woman. I looked over to Lisa. She looked at me.\n\n“Keep driving.” She ordered.\n\nWe reached the bodies on the road. They were a perfectly healthy man and woman. Out of the corner of my eye I could see the tall grass shaking and my instincts kicked in.\n\nI floored it and nearly crashed my car myself. In a few seconds I had reached the other side and through the rearview mirror I could see the man and woman lying on the road stand up.\n\nThey looked right at us.\n\nIn astonishment I stopped the car. Lisa and I were just stunned.\n\nThe man yelled out “Hey, come back here!”\n\nAnd that’s when it became downright terrifying. There was one man who stepped out of the tall grass on the side of the road. Then two women on the other side. Before we knew it, there was about forty people on that road, around that car, all of whom had walked out of that tall grass.\n\nI sat there with a lump in my throat. I couldn’t even begin to know what I just avoided. Why these people pretended to be dead. What these forty or so people would have done to us if we stopped and got out of the car.\n\nThen they started taunting us. Waving their arms at us. I was so disoriented that I drove off as fast as I could. I’m pretty sure I broke the land speed record I was driving that fast. We got off that road and back onto the main highway. Lisa and I didn’t speak the entire time until we reached the first small town we could find.\n\nWe told the sheriff and pleaded with him to stop those people, whoever they were. The sheriff shrugged his shoulders and checked it out but found nothing. No people, no car. We filed a report with the FBI but we haven’t heard back.\n\nSo I’m just writing this to tell you to be careful. The Great American Road Trip is something we all dream about. But there are roads out there that…well, I just don’t want to think about what could’ve happened that day.",

        "text": "**If there are mistakes in this, it's because I am only 14. Hope you enjoy!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI must admit: I do like to browse on r/nosleep from time to time. Most of the posts on here are just shitty rules like 'Rules for staying at Stacey's house' where the protagonist makes some minor mistake and then some mysterious shadows engulf them or something. Very few are actually good, and even fewer are worth upvoting. However, It's not like i have much to do with my life besides reddit. I am a 27-year-old man who has never had a job in his entire life; and probably never will. My severe lack of qualifications has not helped me at all when applying to even the most basic of careers. Not even my single Burberry suit could fool McDonalds into hiring me. I am a failure, so I really shouldn't be slandering peoples stories on here. I mean, they are only stories. Right?\n\nWrong.\n\nIt was a Tuesday night. I live in a small area of London called Whetstone so the crime is relatively low. It was absolutely pissing down with rain when it happened. I was doing my daily scroll of r/nosleep to try and get some form of scare into my system before I went to sleep. Story after story, I failed to find one with some originality in it. All of the plots are the same. Some painfully obvious plot twist with a misleading title. I reminisced of the old days when I went to school. When I had friends. When my life wasn't full of smoking weed and downing vodka. When I had some sort of social life and family. You see; I was a bit of a troubled kid when growing up. My mother died whilst giving birth to me and my father was into the happy dust. He constantly beat me - likely because I was the reason his wife kicked the bucket. I don't blame him for it. I would probably do the same. He eventually died of OD - so I had to resort to dealing to survive. That got me to where I am now. No grades ( I failed all my GCSE's), no family and no reason to live.\n\nMy apartment is nice. The interior is clean and modern. The facilities are tolerable and the neighbours are always kind and friendly. Can't say the same for my landlord. He is a dickhead. All of them are ; I'm sure you can relate.\n\nOh well, I should stop rambling. I don't have much time. I failed to find any half-decent story on this sub. \"r/nosleep has really gone down hill recently,\" I thought to myself. I pushed my joint into the ashtray beside me and stumbled towards my bathroom, the walls swaying as I did. Looking back now, I really needed to stop getting high. It seriously messed me up. Anyway, I did my usual bedtime routine - teeth, face cream, shower ect. After that, I went to bed. I thought more of my past, how I could have been a better person. How if I had tried in school, I wouldn't need to spend nights in filthy trap houses and residences, just so I could survive. I also thought about how bad reddit had gotten since the pandemic - especially r/nosleep. How there was no more originality and everything followed the same shitty model. It sounds weird I know, but dodgy thoughts enter your mind when high. I pretty much fell asleep instantly, despite doing nothing all day.\n\nAnd that's when I met him.\n\nHe had a silky, matte robe that stretched across his figure. His limbs were awfully contorted in ways I can't physically describe, and a hood that covered his head was barely high enough to reveal his glowing, crimson eyes. He was at least 9ft tall in height, if not larger. He towered over me like a skyscraper next to a bungalow. For some reason, even though I had never been told it, his name had been seared into my head like an engraving on a trophy. The Sleepmaster. What? How did he get me here? All around me was a black void of emptiness. I couldn't see anything apart from him. He seemed to be illuminated from a spotlight above, but when I looked up it wasn't there. He turned to face me, slowly cranking his neck until we made eye contact. I practically shit myself when he did. A feeling of dread swarmed into my soul. I tried to run, but my legs were not my own anymore.\n\n\"Did you slander my precious subreddit?\" His voice seemed to penetrate my soul. I didn't even slander it. Sure, I may had mentioned it to a few of my \"clients\", but nothing more. I opened my mouth to speak, but no words came out. It was like I was paralyzed. No - I was paralyzed. He let out a sadistic smirk; a wave of rotten flesh entered my nose as he did forcing me to gag. \"You think it's fiction?\" he asked. I just about managed to nod my head. What kind of dream was this? Nothing I had ever experienced for sure. \"Well then...\" he muttered. The dread in me grew more. \"I'll just have to show you what they experienced.\" Oh no.\n\nIn an instant, I was teleported to a massive hall. It looked like a museum, but more. I was dressed in a smart outfit; a polo shirt, tie, vest, blazer and pants. Next to me, a small group of people, who I seemed to be touring, marvelled at the skeleton of a dinosaur. \"Hey, excuse me.\" said a man. He wasn't dressed like the others were. Instead of an elaborate suit or dress, he was wearing jeans and a green jumper. \"We're gonna go there\" he gestured toward a dark hall way, a pretty woman locked arms with him. Wait. I remembered reading a reddit story on here just like this. It was a tour guide who had to tour a group of rich people in a museum, and attempted to sway them away from the paranormal exhibit. However, he had to let them do whatever they wanted, per his contract. \"Sure, be careful!\" I stumbled nervously. I know how this ends. They touch the dolls glass case and she breaks free. I can only wait.\n\nAttempting to ignore that inevitable disaster, I show the rest of the guests some insects. I show them whatever they ask for, even the most ridiculous demands I still have to meet, like riding the dinosaur skeleton. Suddenly, I hear it. The unmistakable sound of smashed glass. They were not careful. \"Excuse me, I have to go for a few minutes. I will be right back with you.\" I showed them a half-assed smile before darting down the hall to the paranormal exhibit. Panicking heavily, I eventually reached the glass cabinet where she was kept. Of course, it was smashed. The doll was nowhere to be found. In the corner, the woman he walked off with was huddled in the corner, unintentionally flashing her underwear up her dress. I desperately tried to hide my libido as I approached her. \"She.....escaped.\" That's all I managed to get out of her. I needed a way to get out of this. Hurriedly, I picked up one of the shards of glass that were scattered on the floor. Without thinking, I impaled myself with the blade. It only hurt for a moment, before I was gone.\n\n\\---\n\nSomehow, I found myself somewhere new. Next to me, a sealed envelope was neatly placed on the bedside table. I took a moment to examine my surrounds, still shitting myself from my prior situation. The room was decorated with a floral wallpaper. The vintage china and oil-diffusery smell made me sure I was at someone's grandmas house. Carefully, I grabbed and opened the envelope. It read:\n\nThese rules are essential if you want to survive the night here, so please read them carefully.\n\n\\-Keep your lights on at all times\n\n\\-NEVER leave your room after 1.00AM\n\n\\-If you need to go to the bathroom, refer to rule 2a\n\n2a. Look for something to urinate in. If you can't, pray for 3 minutes. After that, you have exactly 5mins and 36secs to go to the bathroom. If you do not make it back in time. Refer to 2b\n\n2b. Kill yourself\n\n\\- Grandma will check your room as 2.23AM and 3.45AM. You should be in bed by these times. If not, refer to xa &amp; xb\n\nxa. Tell her you are sorry 5 times. If she says \"It's okay\" you are safe.\n\nxb. If she just stares at you, Kill either you or your grandma. No exceptions.\n\ny. Don't talk to your Grandma at breakfast. Just ignore her.\n\nWhat the fuck. What is this shit. I'm in one of those shitty rules stories. I check the time on my phone - 0.56AM. Coincidentally, I needed a massive piss, so I looked around the room. Nothing - not even a water bottle of some sort. Well, I guess it's time to pray. I set a timer on my phone and began. I ended up praying to the Sleepmaster, begging him to get me out of this BS - but alas, it was to no avail. After a few minutes, the timer on my phone rang and I bolted to the bathroom without hesitation. I wasn't sure how I knew where the bathroom was, but I just did. I practically ejected the piss inside of me into the toilet bowl, and didn't bother to wash my hands. I checked the time, \"0.58AM\". Then, I remembered Rule 1. \"NEVER leave your room after 1.00AM\". Holy shit. These rule games are harder than I thought. I darted back to my room, pretty sure I smelled dead corpses along the way but didn't think anything of it. Once back in my room, I slammed the door. The time - 0.59AM. I had made it.\n\nSuddenly, there was a knock at my door. There was no rule about not opening the door, so I did. There, a small, frail woman stood, her back hunched like a goblin. Her eyes looked like voids of black, peering into my conscience. I checked the time again. 2.23AM. How. A few minutes ago it was 0.59AM. Whatever. What's the point of questioning it anymore. Like the rules insisted, I said sorry five times; eyes glued shut whilst I did. When my eyelids opened, she just stared at me. I remembered rule xb - I had to kill myself. Sure, there was an option to kill her but the pressure was too much. I couldn't think. I mean, do you blame me? I saw a vase on the shelf next to me. That was good enough. Quickly, I clenched the vase in my hand and smashed it onto my head. The last thing I saw was that Grandma, staring through me, like a tiger watching it's prey. What had I got myself into?\n\n\"You see the mistake you made?\" that deep, burning voice said. All I could see was black, and then a demonic laughter surrounded me. It was him. The Sleepmaster. I had insulted his subreddit, and I was going to pay the price.\n\nI am currently writing to you on my iPhone 3G. In the next room, my supposed dog Rufus stares at the wall blankly. I have tried everything to escape, but every attempt leads to the next story. I hear Rufus walking up to my door now. I hope the Sleepmaster sees this and forgives me. And, for the love of God, don't insult r/nosleep ever. Give every story you see an upvote, leave nice comments and whenever you can, post on here. If any of you have any idea how to get me out of this mess, please tell me. I want to return to my Whetstone house and see my neighbours. I will update whenever I can. \n\nPlease, help me.",

        "text": "My mother had me at the age of 16 and my father left us before I was born. I grew up having her come in and out of my life as my nannie was the person who cared for me walking hours to take me to and from school. Once I turned 11 my mother took full custody of me. My mother wasn't a nice women several times she beat me and I knew she regretted having me \"taking away her life\" but she needed me for goverment money. A few years later my mother met her boyfriend through our neighbour who comes from a very rich family, he was a very well-off man himself being one of the heads of a well established plane engine company.   \n\n\nWe already didn't like each other as he didnt want to have children and my younger sister was born when I was 7 so he was already taking in two children he didnt really care for. After 3 years of my mother being with her partner I witnessed him \"spanking\" my sister rather aggressively. This caused me to attack him defending my sister, we had a aggressive fight. After my mother not taking my side I went emotionally dark on my mother for choosing to stay with him.  \n\n\nAfter few months my mother started leaving me alone at our house and staying with her boyfriend for long peroids of time only dropping by every 1-2 weeks to drop off various amounts of food. The house I was living in was a horrible-mess. My mother hid the fact she was a horder from her boyfriend, her bedroom was a vile mess of mold growing on the walls, mugs full of the blue mushroom mold and rotting clothes sitting around the floor. Her hoarding got so bad it ended up over flowing into mine and my sister room (We had bunk-beds). So I was forced to sleep on a sofa that was older than myself I had no real idea on how to look after myself. I was going to school smelling bed, having no friends or any form of people to talk to. I started to try and push myself into sports which I regret because this is where I started to hate my life. I shattered my ankle playing rugby forcing me to stay home and with nobody there to care for me. I spent days at the time laying on the sofa and dragging myself to the bathroom with nobody there for me. My uncle (who is a drug addict) would stop in and visit to check in on me. (and to do drugs in my kitchen and crash on a fold out sofa in there). He would come and go after a while he stopped coming to \"visit\" as the police knew my kitchen was his drug usage place.  \n\n\nAfter a while of no human interaction and nobody around to check up on me I became extremely depressed and start to hate my existance. Only eating mayonaise on bread and tubs of ice-cream because at the time a tub was 50p and it would fill me up. \n\n**I thought I was alone but I wasn't.**  \n\n\nAfter so long I started to have dark nightmares where I was still on the sofa laying there but dark figures would stand over me for hours on end. No faces, no features just darkness it was always a tall man. After awhile the nightmares got worse the figures leaning in getting closer and closer to me. Still not facial features nothing just a void of nothing.  \n\n\nAfter awhile I started skipping school due to lack of sleep because I knew If I slept I would see these figures but because I was not sleep and avoiding school with nothing to do I would lay on this dirty sofa just laying there like my life had no meaning (and thats how I felt).    \n\n\nI started not eating due to not leaving the house and our tap-water was dirty so I didnt drink any water. I became so malnourished I was turning into skin and bones. I ended up spending a few days sleeping in the bathroom after puking my stomach acid. I wasn't far from being that malnourished I could of died, luckely my uncle made a random stop by and called an ambulance I ended up in hospital having a spinal tab without numbing agents.  \n\n\nAfter a few days in hospital I was sent home without any notice to my mother so she didnt know what happened. I spent the next few months thinking I could die and with the medication I was on and being a child I didnt really \"respect\" the dosage and the nightmares became to \"real\". I started to accept the shadow figures just laying there awake even with them hanging over me scared but accepting.  \n\n\nAfter awhile I made a friend on \"bebo\" and hung out with her at the weekend she got me to hangout with people I didnt know and I started to feel better and after a few more years the figures slowly dissapeared.  \n\n\nMe and my mother dont speak rarely we speak via email and thats it.  \n\n\nThats my story.",

        "text": "As the sun sets over the city skyline, I stand outside my apartment building, staring up at the windows of my now-ex-boyfriend's apartment. The relationship had lasted a decade, but it was time for it to end. I wasn't happy anymore, and I knew it was time to move on. It wasn't until I started packing my things and preparing to leave that things took a dark turn.\nAs I was packing, I noticed strange symbols hidden among his belongings. They were etched into the corners of his books, on the bottom of his shoes, and even on the walls. At first, I thought they were just some sort of strange artwork or an obscure hobby he had picked up, but as I began to research them, I realized they were ancient demonic symbols.\nMy initial reaction was disbelief. Demons didn't exist, right? But as I continued my research, I found more and more evidence to the contrary. I couldn't believe it, but it seemed that my boyfriend of ten years was a demon.\nI was terrified, but I didn't know what to do. I didn't want to confront him about it because I knew he would deny it. I didn't even know how to break up with a demon, let alone one that I had been dating for so long. I decided to leave him a note, hoping it would be enough to make him realize that I was serious about ending things.\nThat night, I tossed and turned in my bed, unable to shake the feeling that something was watching me. Every time I closed my eyes, I could feel an icy breath on the back of my neck, and I knew that I was no longer alone.\nThe next morning, I woke up to find my apartment in disarray. Drawers had been pulled out, papers scattered everywhere, and the furniture had been overturned. But the most disturbing thing was the note I had left for my boyfriend, now torn to shreds and covered in what looked like blood.\nI knew then that I had to get out of the apartment, but as soon as I opened the door, I was hit with a wave of fear so strong that I couldn't move. Outside my door stood a group of demons, their eyes glowing with an otherworldly light. They looked like something straight out of a nightmare, with razor-sharp teeth and skin as black as coal.\nI backed away slowly, hoping to make it back into my apartment, but they were too fast. Before I knew it, they had me surrounded. I closed my eyes and waited for the worst, but nothing happened. I opened my eyes again and found that the demons were gone.\nConfused and disoriented, I stumbled back into my apartment and collapsed onto the couch. My heart was pounding in my chest, and I felt like I was going to throw up. It was then that I heard a voice behind me.\n\"I'm sorry.\"\nI turned around to see my ex-boyfriend, standing in the doorway. He looked different now, his eyes glowing with a fierce light, and his skin now covered in scales. I knew then that the rumors were true - he was a demon.\n\"I didn't mean for this to happen,\" he said, his voice low and mournful. \"I was protecting you.\"\n\"Protecting me?\" I repeated, my voice trembling. \"From what?\"\n\"From them,\" he said, gesturing towards the empty space where the demons had been. \"They've been after you for years, but I kept them away. I didn't want you to know the truth, but I had to protect you.\"\nI didn't know what to say. Everything was happening so fast, and I felt like I was losing my mind. But then, a sound caught my attention - the sound of footsteps in the hallway outside. They were slow and deliberate, and I knew without a doubt that they belonged to the demons who had just vanished from my apartment.\n\"We have to go,\" I said, grabbing my ex-boyfriend's hand. \"We have to get out of here.\"\nTogether, we ran down the stairs and out into the street. The demons were close behind us, their eyes glowing in the darkness. I could hear them snarling and snapping at our heels, and I knew that we were running out of time.\nWe made it to the park, the demons hot on our heels. I turned to face them, my heart pounding in my chest. My ex-boyfriend stood beside me, his eyes burning with an otherworldly fire.\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said again, his voice barely above a whisper.\nAnd then, with a roar that shook the trees, he transformed into his true form. He was no longer the man I had known and loved for ten years - he was a demon, with horns and wings and a tail that whipped through the air. He was a creature of darkness, but he had loved me, and he had protected me.\nThe demons surrounded us, snarling and snapping. I closed my eyes, waiting for the end.\nBut then, there was a blinding flash of light, and a deafening roar. When I opened my eyes again, the demons were gone, and my ex-boyfriend was lying on the ground, his body torn and broken.\nI fell to my knees beside him, tears streaming down my face. I had broken up with him, and yet he had sacrificed himself to save me.\n\"I'm sorry,\" I whispered, my voice barely above a whisper. \"I'm so sorry.\"\nAnd then, with a final gasp of breath, he was gone.\nI don't remember much after that. I remember the police arriving, and the paramedics, and the ambulance that took me to the hospital. I remember the questions they asked me, and the looks of pity and horror on their faces when I told them the truth about my ex-boyfriend.\nBut mostly, I remember him. I remember the man I loved, the demon who protected me, and the creature who gave his life for me. He was a monster, but he was my monster, and I will never forget him.\nYears have passed since that night, and I've never been the same.

        "text": "I’ve never told anyone what happened to me when I was fourteen, but I guess I kind of have always wanted to. My name is Max, I’m twenty-five now, so this is a bit of ancient history I suppose. My grandfather passed away when I was fourteen, and my mother was his only child. He was divorced from my grandma, and had never remarried or anything, so all the stuff you have to do when someone dies fell to my mom. He lived a few states away, so one weekend we went out to his house so mom could go through everything and see if there was anything she or I wanted to keep before the estate sale.\n\nHis house was pretty cool, really. He had acres of land, and there was a pond, and he had an in-ground pool, and the house wasn’t like a mansion or anything, but it was way more than one old guy needed. \n\nGrandpa Ray had grown up super poor. His father was an alcoholic who couldn’t hold a job and was abusive to his kids (Grandpa had a brother and a sister, both of who passed before he did). Grandpa vowed to never be like his father, so he stayed away from alcohol, and he worked really hard, getting a doctorate and becoming a college professor, and building a really nice life. \n\nOh my gosh, I totally tend to ramble, let me get to Lemonbelly. So we drive to his house one Friday, and get there late, so we just crash. Saturday morning we start going through the house, both of us picking things to keep. I find the attic and head up. It was a total jackpot. First of all there’s a box full of Playboys from like, the seventies and eighties. I spend a fair amount of the early morning flipping through some of those. There’s really cool clothes, some old toys, just kind of neat stuff. \n\nAnd then I come across the chest, pushed back into the corner and covered with an old blanket. It’s locked, but after searching some more I find a key hanging on a rusty nail on the other side of the attic. It opens the chest.\n\nThere’s a little bit of disappointment at first, the chest was mostly filled with old newspapers and some manilla envelopes with stuff like the house deed, and my mom’s birth certificate and all that. But at the bottom of the box, tucked into the corner, was a small velvet bag. I took it and untied a stiff bit of string from around the opening. I tilted the bag out and Lemonbelly fell into my hand.\n\nOkay, so I know right now none of you know who Lemonbelly is, but I’m going to tell this story the right way. I didn’t know who he was at the time either. Inside the bag had been a bottle, maybe half the size of one of those old glass coke bottles. It was glass too, stopped with a cork that looked as though it might crumble into dust as soon as it was touched. Inside the bottle was a dark amber liquid, too dense to see through. I turned the bottle in my hand and felt it shift. There was something floating within the dark liquid. I turned the bottle another way, and there was a tiny thump as a yellow ball slid through the liquid and came to rest against the glass.\n\nI mean, I thought it was a ball at first, I could really only make out half the ball, the liquid inside the bottle was so dark. There was another bit of string wrapped around the neck of the bottle, and a small tag attached to it. On one side of the tag, what I assumed at the time was Latin (and I was correct). It read Nulla Domus hic. On the other side of the tag was English. LEMONBELLY it sad in blocky red letters, written in a shaky hand. And underneath, NEVER OPEN. \n\nObviously, my teenage curiosity had my fingers on that cork in a heartbeat. I would have pulled it open right then and who knows how this story would have gone, but I heard my mother calling for me. I set the bottle on a nearby shelf, and hurried down to see what she needed. And then my mom kept me busy with this and that for the rest of the day, and I kind of forgot about the bottle. To be quite honest, it was the Playboys that sent me back up to the attic on Sunday just before we left. I stashed a few in my duffle bag, and then as I was turning I saw the bottle and hurried over to it and dropped it in my bag as well.\n\nI didn’t empty my bag for another week or so. School was kind of going rough, if I can be quite honest. I was a chubby kid, and there were these three friends that gave me a lot of shit. That week I also started having really bad dreams, like weird nightmares that I couldn’t even remember the next day, but they would have me waking up in a cold sweat, or even yelling out once or twice, my blanket on the floor and my bedsheet twisted and wrapped around me.\n\n\nWhen I did get into the bag it was to stash the magazines in my closet. I pulled the bottle out and set it on my nightstand. I would have maybe opened it again but I remember wondering what exactly that gross-looking liquid was, and what the yellow ball could be and I started to worry it would poison me or something. Maybe it would just be cooler to hang onto it and keep it on my table or shelf.\n\nA month or so after I found the bottle I had a dream that I do remember. It sticks with me now, I can recall every last bit of it as though I had it just last night. I was standing in a strange room, made of giant stones stacked upon one another. Behind me an opening to what looked to be a desert, it was night and I could hear the wind blowing. Before me a raised dias with a throne of sorts. Sitting on the throne a figure wearing a long cloak, the hood up to conceal his face.\n\n“Tell me young one, what do you desire?” the cloaked figure asked me, his voice raspy and low. \n\nThe bullying at school had only gotten worse. “Joey, James, and Chris won’t leave me alone. I want them to stop,” I said in the dream, stepping forward.\n\n“You must free me then,” the cloaked figure said. As he spoke he stood, and the cloak fell away. The figure was much taller than the average man, at least eight feet, and was completely nude. Its skin was a sickly pale yellow, except for its jutting belly, which darkened to a lemony color. Its face was hideous, folds of fat that jiggled as it grinned, its teeth sharp and its eyes small and black. \n\nIt held a hand out to me, its fingers long and ending in curved nails that looked as though they could cut through flesh as easily as a knife through butter. \n\n“Free me!”\n\n“Yes!” I said in the dream. I bowed low, and then I woke.\n\nI was standing in my room, holding something in my hand. I looked down, my eyes taking a moment to adjust to the dark. I held the bottle in my hand and felt a shock of fear roll through my system. I was looking at that yellow ball and realized it wasn’t a ball at all. It was a belly, great and distended and yellow. Beyond the belly, no doubt, the rest of Lemonbelly, the liquid too dark to reveal him. \n\n“Lemonbelly,” I remember saying out loud. I had two fingers on the cork. I pulled. \n\nI expected… something. But nothing happened. I let the cork fall t the ground, I held the bottle up. I could not feel the movement of an object inside, the way I once had. I shook it a bit, but it wouldn’t appear. Lemonbelly was gone. \n\nSomehow I fell back asleep that night. I dreamed again. I was standing now in a strangers living room. The front door behind me opened slowly and I turned. Lemonbelly was there, one hand on the knob, ducking to get his ugly head in under the doorframe.\n\n“You should see this,” he said, looking right at me. A cold chill spread in my chest as I was overcome with fear. Was this a dream? It had to be. The whole damn thing had to be a dream, I thought at the time. \n\nLemonbelly stepped past me in that dream and I pressed myself back against the wall in an effort to give him as much berth as I could. “Come,” he said over his shoulder, and in the dream, I was helpless to do anything other than follow. \n\nLemonbelly moved so strangely, his movements jerky and unwieldy. He went up the stairs and still I followed. It was like he knew exactly where he was going. He moved down the upstairs hall to a door that was closed to the crack. Unease and dread washed over me as the yellow monster pushed the door open and stepped inside. In my dream I was willing myself not to follow, but my feet paid no attention to my brain, and into the room I went.\n\nIt was Joey’s room. The leader of the three boys who bullied me. I saw him asleep in his bed. He was tall and athletic and his two stooges did whatever he told them too. He had been picking on me for years. I was torn, watching Lemonbelly move to his bedside. I didn’t know what the creature was going to do, but I knew it wasn’t going to be good. At the same time, I kind of wanted it. I wanted Joey to be punished, I wanted him to be hurt.\n\nLemonbelly looked back at me, his pinprick eyes glowing in the soft light of the silver moon. Then he turned to Joey and opened his mouth. His jaw fell almost to his chest, and then kept going. It dropped and dropped and dropped and soon his mouth was a massive black maw ringed in sharp teeth. \n\n“No!” I cried out in the dream, but Lemonbelly did not stop. He reached for Joey, grabbed the boy with frightening speed, and was shoving him into his mouth before he had a chance to wake up fully. I could hear him scream as Lemonbelly’s lips came together, his mouth normal again. He was screaming from that gorged yellow stomach. Screaming for help.\n\nI woke with a start. It was dark still, and when I looked at my phone it was four in the morning. I slept no more that night.\n\nThe next morning, Joey wasn’t at school. That afternoon, our grade was called into the gym. We sat on the bleachers and our principal told us that Joey was missing. He asked anyone for any information they might have. I kept my hand down.\n\nWhen I got home, I checked the bottle. Lemonbelly was still missing. I went to the bathroom intending to pour the liquid down the drain, but something stopped me. I don’t know why, but I just couldn’t go through with my plan. I corked the bottle back up.\n\nThank night, I had another dream. I watched Lemonbelly enter James’ house and eat him as well. I was powerless to stop him. I didn’t even try, I was worried he would eat me if I did. The next day I feigned being sick so I could stay home from school. Around noon one of my friends text me to tell me they had another assembly, and this time it was about James going missing. Apparently, the police were there this time, asking questions of his friends. Everyone seemed to think maybe the two boys had run away. I was the only one who knew the truth.\n\nI also knew that stopping Lemonbelly was going to fall to me. I couldn’t go to anyone, not my mother, not the police. What would I tell them? I had to figure something out. I stared at that bottle for a long time. Then, finally, a possible answer came to me. I looked at the tag and translated the Latin. It came out roughly to ‘There is no home here’.  I had an idea. A wild one, but one I had to try.\n\nThat night, I snuck out of my home. I climbed out of my window, thankful that my room was on the ground floor. I considered getting my bike from the garage but I didn’t want to risk lifting the door and waking my mother. So I had to go on foot, and I was worried I would be too late. I ran for Chris’ house, knowing that I would find Lemonbelly there. \n\nHe lived nearby, thank god, but my heart dropped when I got to his house and saw that the front door was standing open. I slipped inside and shut the door behind me. I considered yelling out and waking up Chris’ parents, but I didn’t know what I would say. If he was gone already, how would it look for me to be there, in their home? \n\nA creak from the floor overhead. I had never been here, but it was easy enough to find the stairs. I moved up them quickly, just in time to see Lemonbelly disappear through a doorway. I followed him. He sensed me, turning as he crouched over Chris’ bed.\n\n“Leave me,” he snarled, but I shook my head. I tried to reply, but my mouth had gone dry and the words I attempted died in my throat. I jammed my hand into my jacket pocket and pulled out the bottle. If Lemonbelly was scared, he didn’t show it, but he did take a step toward me, reaching one long hand in my direction.\n\nI uncorked the bottle and held it in front of me. Now Lemonbelly paused, glancing down at the bottle and then back to my face. Suddenly he lunged forward, and I leaped back, barely keeping the bottle upright, and barely keeping out of range of his swiping claw. I slammed back into the wall in the hallway and turned and ran. Lemonbelly followed, I could hear him lumbering down the stairs hot on my heels. I flew out of the front door and into the street, turning to see Lemonbelly still chasing me. \n\n“I will not be imprisoned again,” Lemonbelly snarled. \n\n“You will!” I told him, holding the bottle forward. I said the Latin words. Nulla domus hic. Lemonbelly roared and the bottle grew hot in my hand, so hot that I almost dropped it. There was a flash of bright light and then a popping sound, and Lemonbelly was gone. The weight of the bottle in my hand was different, and I slammed the cork home. \n\nI held the bottle up and used the light from a streetlamp to confirm that the yellow stomach was there, pressed against the glass when I held the bottle a certain way. Through the liquid came one long hand, pressing against the glass as well. I shivered.\n\nAnd that was that. I learned that night just what my grandfather had come to possess. Ultimate power. I would be lying if I said I never let Lemonbelly out again. There was that time in college when my girlfriend left me for another guy. He had to go, and so did she when she didn’t come back to me. That guy who got that promotion over me a few years ago, he didn’t deserve to live, did he? It’s easy, letting Lemonbelly free, and then going and collecting him. He almost doesn’t even fight me anymore. He never turns on me, never comes for me until I come from him. Maybe he’s not allowed, I sense some sort of weird rules are at play here. Now that I think of it, he’s never tried to hurt me, he always seems to be going for the bottle. All I know is it’s nice to be the one picking on people.",

        "text": "Most people crack when I slice open their eye. The vitreous flows out with such perfect viscosity that, for a moment, I can’t even hear their screams.\n\nIt’s not just the pain that rends their souls. What really gets to a person about the eye is a loss of hope. Most of them believe that they’ll escape my tools and go back to a happy life where the family gets together for backyard cookouts and couples plan for retirement. That hope finally drains away when they realize they’re about to lose an eye, because it means they can never re-enter society in the way they once knew. I’m not a doctor; by design, the procedure damages their appearance in ways that will dominate every future human interaction. \n\nThat, and I think that people imagine themselves as *being* in their eyes. Arms and legs are distal appendages controlled by where we sit inside ourselves; more than anything else, we see our eyes, those windows to the soul, as the physical space where *we* exist. \n\nDestroying them tears down boundaries that people think are unbreakable. I’ve seen men betray their mothers and women give away infant children because I promise it will keep me from digging their eyes out of their faces.\n\nI’m lying, of course.\n\nThe fundamental truth of my job is that everyone has a breaking point. If you doubt me, just be grateful that you can live the lie of telling yourself that you would do anything for your family. \n\nWhich is why I couldn’t understand the man who didn’t flinch when I put the spoon against his ocular nerve. He didn’t even twitch.\n\n“Does it hurt?” I cooed. \n\nHe smiled. He actually *smiled*. “More than you can *possibly* imagine.”\n\nI frowned and dug the spoon into his skull. I’ve done this enough times to know when I’ve separated the eye from its socket; more than you’d think, the sensation is like scooping out a pumpkin. \n\nI couldn’t enjoy the eye jelly after he refused to react. “You think I can’t make it hurt worse?” I asked, licking my lips as I poured the eye into a Mason jar.\n\n“Nothing I can say will stop you from making it worse,” he answered in a complete deadpan.\n\nI flared my nostrils as I picked up the iron. “This will cauterize every wound. Do you understand what this means?”\n\nThe man glanced at me and sighed. “Melting my skin will ensure that I don’t bleed out from the wound.” He shrugged. “It means that you can cut me over and over while keeping me alive to feel it all.” The man peered at my tools. “The cherry on top is the process that saves me will cause intense agony in its application.”\n\nHe spoke with all the enthusiasm of a call-taker at an income tax firm.\n\n“You forgot to mention that I’ll do each appendage one at a time to draw this out,” I added.\n\nHe was silent for three seconds before rolling his gaze toward me. “Sorry, what? I wasn’t paying attention.”\n\n*\n\n“Very few people loose nineteen fingers and toes without cracking,” I explained thirteen hours later. I rubbed my forehead with my sleeve, then wiped the coagulated blood off the warm iron yet again. “Here goes the last one.”\n\n*\n\nI tossed the ring finger over my shoulder when I was done cauterizing him, sending it bouncing out the door. The room smelled like a whole-hog cookout, which is precisely why I’m a vegetarian.\n\n“You’re out of digits,” I explained. I didn’t attempt to hide my erection. “You know what that means, right?”\n\nHe yawned. “It means that it’s time to destroy my genitals.”\n\n*\n\nI’ll be honest: it creeped me out to see him so unfazed. You’d think that force-feeding a man a meat smoothie of his own body parts would cleave his mind in half, but this guy looked exactly as he did when they brought him in. “You know that the cartel won’t send you home, right?” I tried to sound like I wasn’t begging, but I knew what they’d do to me if the target didn’t crack.\n\nIt had never been an issue before.\n\n“Vanjans,” he answered.\n\n*Shit*, that word sent chills up and down my spine before going up and down a second time, finally settling in my nutsack and freezing my taint.\n\nThen he pointed to the door. \n\nI turned around and looked at the bloodstains that had been left when I threw his thumb out of the room.\n\nWait.\n\nHe wasn’t supposed to be able to point. \n\nI turned my head slowly back to look at the man I’d been brutalizing. I prayed that hadn’t healed.\n\nAll of his fingers and toes were back.\n\nThis is why I don’t pray. \n\nTrying and failing to hold back the oncoming hyperventilation, I lifted my gaze to meet his face.\n\nHis eye was back where it belonged.\n\n“Did you not…” I gasped stupidly.\n\n“Oh, the pain was felt,” he answered. \n\n“What the fuck did you *do* to me?”\n\nHe smiled. In contrast to just three minutes ago, he had all thirty-two clean, white teeth still in his head. \n\n“The question, my friend, is what did *you* do? And to whom?”\n\nI wanted to know just what the hell that meant, but was cut off. My employer sent two of his associates to relieve me of my duty.\n\nThey sent me home.\n\nThe same thought permeated my head with every footstep:\n\nWas that real?\n\nBecause I’d unleashed more aggression, anger, and pain today than I had at any point in my storied career. It seemed impossible that the world would absorb it and just keep spinning.\n\nThen I noticed the blood. It was pooling just outside my front door.\n\nNo.\n\nI reached a shaking hand to the knob; it was already ajar, like someone had forgotten to close it after breaking in.\n\nI live to create fear, and I know it like an old friend. So when this particular species of terror crept into me, I understood exactly how afraid I should be.\n\nI couldn’t breathe.\n\nThat’s when I stopped myself and looked down. Blood wasn’t the only thing on the ground.\n\nMy soul fell out of my body and I could only think of suicide as I recognized the ring on my wife’s severed finger between my feet, looking like someone had carelessly thrown it [from another room](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).\n\n[BD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/)\n\n\n\n[W](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcn_pa1QfNMRzbTuJqXSoRQ)\n\n[E](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/)",

        "text": "Have you ever tried one of those impossible burgers? They’re supposed to be the vegetarian alternative to regular burgers. Real meat doesn’t agree with me, so these plant-based burgers are a good way to satisfy that craving I have, without the unpleasant effects that meat has on me. They first came out in 2016, and Burger King started selling them back in 2019. A lot of people don’t know though, they cook those plant patties on the same grill as the real meat patties, so if you want it to actually be vegetarian you have to ask for it to be cooked in the oven instead. I didn’t know that the first time I ever ordered one; it was a good thing the kid working the register told me. It was a big change in my life; I started eating impossible burgers regularly, and everything was pretty good for about 6 years \n\n \n\nThere’s this girl I worked with, Millie; you might know somebody like her. She was all about the carnivore lifestyle, bragging about being able to eat a 30-ounce steak by herself, eating sticks of butter for some reason, basically taking pride in never eating vegetables. It’s become something of a trend lately. Despite the opposite lifestyles we had, we got along well; always giving each other shit, like her asking if I was allowed to eat animal crackers. I would joke that if she was ever autopsied, they would open her stomach and find old boots, license plates, and half of a 5-year-old child; like a shark. I’ve tried for a long time not to get attached to people but I did like her; that’s why I’m still torn up about what happened \n\n \n\nOn the 4th of July last year, Millie and her boyfriend were having a cookout and she invited a few people from work, me included. Beer, hot dogs, burgers, typical stuff. I brought a pack of impossible burgers and made sure to ask that they be cooked separately, so they wouldn’t be tainted by the real meat.  But Millie though; I don’t know if she was drunk and forgot, or if she did it as a joke. I’m more inclined to think she did it on purpose, considering all the prior back and forth shit talking we had done. She gave me a real burger without telling me, and they do taste very similar. \n\n \n\n2016 to 2022; that was the longest I had gone without eating meat in the 300 years since I was given this curse; since I got lost hunting in the woods with my friend. After 13 days of wandering and not finding any game, I turned in desperation to the only thing that there was to eat; I made it quick, a bullet in the head while he slept. I survived and made it out because of that, but my fate was sealed. The thing about me now, when I eat real meat, I want more meat; I can’t control it. I keep eating until there’s nothing left in the area to eat. They’re never going to find Millie’s body, or anyone else who was at that party; there’s nothing left to find. After they were gone my mind cleared enough that I knew to leave the city. I spent a few days alone out in the desert, until I felt confident that I had it under control again. \n\n \n\nI’ve started over. A new city, a new name. I’ve done it before, but hopefully it’ll be a while before I have to do it again. So yeah, that’s about it; I guess the point I wanted to make is that people really ought to respect other people’s life choices",

        "text": "\"It's gloomier than usual here,\" I sighed as I gazed out the window, watching the rain cascade down in sheets onto the pavement. I longed to see the sun again, to explore the nearby forest clearing with Dips.\n\n\"June! Have you taken Dips out for his evening walk?\" my mum hollered from the kitchen.\n\n\"Not yet Mum! It's pouring outside,\" I replied, my tone weary.\n\n\"Well, go get his raincoat and take him out. He needs his potty breaks,\" she retorted.\n\nI grumbled under my breath. The rain had persisted for the past week, and I was growing weary of walking Dips in the downpour. However, I knew he needed the exercise and fresh air. Besides, his antics always brought a smile to my face, especially when he stumbled upon unusual items left behind by others. One time, he discovered an old chest adorned with mysterious symbols, and I couldn't resist running my fingers over them, feeling chills run down my back before dropping the chest on the ground. It was such a weird sensation. I was snapped back to reality when I felt a familiar snout bop my legs. Dips must have really wanted to go to the loo if he brought his leash to me voluntarily. I ruffled his fur and let him know we would be heading out soon. After waving goodbye to my mum, I armed both Dips and I with raincoats to battle the relentless droplets.\n\nThe sky was dark and foreboding, and thunder rumbled in the distance.\n\nWe made our way down our usual route. Our city is fortunate enough to have sheltered walkways in certain areas, and Dips, being the Shiba Inu he is, disliked getting wet paws. I often rolled my eyes at his reluctance to cross small puddles. I looked up and saw his favourite bush.\n\n\"Okay, buddy, do your thing. I'll be here watching and protecting you,\" I said.\n\nDips ran over, almost pulling me away when he recognised his bush. I laughed.\n\n\"Sorry buddy, you must really need the loo,\" I whispered.\n\nI stood there in the streets, staring and people watching while I waited. The rain had let up a bit. Great, it would be a nice change from the gloomy sky. I pulled out my free hand, palm up, to feel the rain. Maybe one day I will learn to love the rain, but that thought did not finish itself as the pitter-patter of the rain on my skin formed a pattern.\n\nDrip, drip... Drip Drip Drip Drip.. Drip… Drip.\n\nIt could not be right, but there it goes again.\n\nDrip, drip... Drip Drip Drip Drip.. Drip… Drip.\n\nI stood there, palm up and dumbfounded. Was this mores code?\n\nDips' growl brought me back, and I immediately spotted a man dodging behind an alleyway just in front of me. My heart skipped a beat and I felt uneased immediately. I tugged at Dips’ lesh.\n\n\"Let's go home, Dips, hurry,\" I said.\n\nI hurried home, practically dragging my poor orange dog along, luckily our usual pathways were along the main streets where there are people about. Dips seems to be rather corporative as his hurried steps matched mine, maybe he senses the danger too. My mind raced as I slammed the door. My heart sank, I could have sworn I have seen the loaming figure following me down the streets when I turned back a couple of times.\n\n“MUM!”\n\n“What’s wrong sweetie?!”\n\n“There is a man following me back home when I took Dips out for a walk.”\n\nHer eyes widen as she stood up to look out the window.\n\n“Describe him to me honey.”\n\n“Black… black stripped pants… and a… … hat, mummy I’m scared.”\n\n“Oh darling, come here.”\n\nShe gave me a tight hug, whispering words of comfort as she kept a lookout for the stranger.\n\n“Well, whoever it is, I think he is gone sweetie. Now, let us get you and old doggie there warm up, shall we?\n\nI nod, staring out at the window. The rain is heavier now.\n\nDrip, drip... Drip Drip Drip Drip.. Drip… Drip.",

        "text": "Disclaimer: I'm sorry if I won't be able to explain this clearly, English is not my 1st language lol\n\nMy father got bedridden for 14 years because of Parkinson's Disease before he passed away. But before you feel bad for him, let me tell you one thing: he's not a good person. He was a good provider before he got sick, yes, but he's nowhere near being a good person (even after getting bedridden).\n\n2 years before he passed away, he can no longer move from neck down. He can only move his eyes and speak faintly. That's also when he started acting weird, like he's not himself anymore. It's like he's not even sleeping anymore and keeps on saying random things. He just keeps calling for my mom, \"Ma\", round the clock. And when my mom tends to him, he just stares at her. He also had this weird small hole on his arm that doesn't bleed, but keeps on leaking what looks like thick water. My mom always cleans that hole but it doesn't seem to heal.\n\n\nA few months before he passed away, his appetite increased insanely. He was only eating non-solid food since he can't really chew anymore, but he would ask to be fed all day long. A few minutes after eating, he would ask for food again and when we tell him that he just ate, he would say, \"I have to eat, I'm starving.\" Then one time, he said, \"They told me I haven't eaten yet.\" My mom asked, \"Who?\" And my dad said, \"Them\" (he looks a little scared while looking at his bedside)\n\nWe got scared but also curious with his response. So one day, while my mom was feeding him, she jokingly said to my dad, \"Why do you always feel hungry? Your appetite is big enough for five people\" my father said, \"Three\", then he continued, \"There are three of us eating.\" \n\nI was like, \"Holy sh*t, I wish I didn't hear that.\"\n\nBack then, we lived in a small, studio-type apartment that has an attic. Me and my mom share the same bed, then my dad's bed is around 3 feet away from ours, beside the stairs going to the attic which is my older brother's room. My older brother was already working at that time, and only comes home on weekends. We haven't told him about what my dad said that there are three of them eating because he's a scaredy cat, lol. But then one night, he woke us up looking pale, sweating, and looked reaaaally scared. He said that he had a nightmare that seemed so real.  \n\nIn his dream, he woke up at the attic and felt thirsty. He was about to climb down the stairs when he saw that my dad was with three other men. Three other men that looked EXACTLY like my father. One of them is just standing, one of them is bald and watching my mother while sleeping, while the other one has very long hair with a long tongue poking the hole on my dad's arm. They all looked up to him, and that's when he woke up.\n\nAnother side story:\nThere are lots of other creepy things that happened after that, but here's another one that marked.\n\nThis happened one afternoon, 2 weeks before my dad died. I'm just laying down on our bed while watching on my phone. My brother is beside me, asleep. I heard my dad calling for me, and I didn't look at him instantly because he hasn't done that in a long time. But when I looked at him, he was sitting on his bed. SITTING.ON.HIS.BED. His body has been stiff for years, he can't even move his neck, and yet there he was, sitting upright and doesn't even seem like he was struggling to keep his balance. He's waving his arms while saying, \"Come, come here. I'm about to get healed.\" My mind was blown and I thought, hhhhell naaaah, there's no way I'm going to come near you. I turned my back on him while thinking, \"f*ck, what if I turn around and he's even nearer?\" I didn't want to wake my brother because I know he would be even more scared than I was, so I waited like a minute then took a peek at him, and saw that he was crawling back to his bed.\n\nI was scared shitless.",

        "text": "The year was 1970 when it happened, I still remember it all like it was yesterday. I was a nineteen year old kid taken in by Woodstock and other groovy things. \n\nThe story behind Mr. Cooper was pretty interesting. It was 1956 and he was the best barber in town. Everyone respected him as a good person and war hero from WW2. They said that he was always busy cutting hair. One day he closed shop early and walked two miles home to surprise his wife. He looked through the window and she was mounted on top of his best friend. He went back to work and came back at the usual time. His wife didn’t know he knew.\n\nNext day, his friend came in for a cut and he kept his composure until it was time to shave. He slit his throat with a straight razor. People panicked and ran out. He barricaded himself in his shop and shot himself before authorities could get in.\n\nThe rumor always was is if you followed the rules in his abandoned shop that he would give you a hair cut. But if you disrespected him, he’d kill you. \n\nThe rules were simple.\n1. Light a candle.\n2. Say “barber, barber in the shop. Would you take some off the top?”\n3. Be respectful \n4. Don’t scream.\n\nMost of us thought it was just crap. We didn’t have TikTok or YouTube. All we had was each other’s words, which quite frankly is crap.\n\nMy dad was the police chief in our town. Our town was a lot like Mayberry but more PG13. Not much crime, everyone knew everyone. I always heard him talk about people sneaking in the shop and fornicating, drinking, and how it was a bad area.\n\nCuriosity began to take over and I made a lie that I was going to a friends house. I did consider asking a friend to come along but if this thing was true, multiple people would be a disaster.\n\nI pulled up to the building and seen some busted windows and no other cars near by. I grabbed my candle and said a prayer before I walked in the door. \n\nI looked around and seen some rats scatter across the floor. I stepped on some empty beer cans and seen graffiti on the walls.\n\nI lit the candle and held on to it and chanted. \n\n“Barber, barber in the shop.”\n\nI felt my teeth begin to chatter. I let out a deep breath.\n\n“Would you take some off the top?”\n\nNothing happened…not at first. The room began to become colder and I heard some footsteps crunch over old papers. The chair turned around. I looked as the dust covered mirror spelled “sit.”\n\nEverything in my body was telling me to run, but I remembered not to break rules.  I slowly stepped up to the chair and sat down. \n\nThe chair turned around and faced towards the mirror. There was a great silence. \n\n“Thank you sir, I’d like a trim. Do it how you think would be best.”\n\nA cape flew around my body and I seen a straight razor and pair of scissors levitated towards me. I closed my eyes and heard as my hair was being snipped.\n\nOccasionally I’d feel his breath blow against me. Sometimes my hair felt like it was being pulled. I almost let out a scream at one point then I heard a noise from him. “Shhhhhhh.” The razor dangled in front of me.\n\nI stayed quiet for the remaining of the time just hoping I didn’t piss him off somehow. He took the straight razor and began shaving near the top of my neck where he missed a few spots.\n\nThen I felt his hands push down on my shoulder as I faced the mirror. Slowly his apparition appeared. It was somewhat transparent and you looked a lot like the old pictures we seen of him looked like. I looked behind me and seen nothing.\n\n“This is a great haircut, thank you.” He started to remove the cape when I heard the door open and footsteps.\n\n“Come on babe. We’ll make it quick.” A kid I went to school with and his girlfriend came in. They both stopped walking when they seen me.\n\n“What the hell are you doing in that chair? Trying to scare us of some ghostie?” He began cackling out a laugh.\n\nI look in the mirror and Mr. Cooper turned towards them. The pair of scissors he had rushed towards him and plunged in his head. His girlfriend let out a scream.\n\nI bit my tongue in hopes I wouldn’t scream. I was paralyzed with fear. A straight razor slid across her neck and blood began to spew to the floor. She dropped moments later. \n\nThe cape around me was removed. There was silence.\n\n“Thank you for a very nice cut, Mr. Cooper. “ I reached in my wallet and pulled out seven dollars. “I don’t know if you’d care for the money, but I’ll leave it on the counter.” \n\nI walked out carefully and drove off slowly. I didn’t go to a friends house afterwards. I pulled into a factory parking lot and waited til about noon before I came home. I tried my best to sleep but it didn’t happen.\n\nI pulled up to my house with a cup of coffee. My dad picked at me thinking he didn’t think I’d get a trim up ever. I lied saying I went to a newer shop that opened weeks ago. The phone rang and he answered.\n\n“I’ll be right in.”\n\nMy mom rubbed his shoulder. “What is it hone”\n\n“Two kids were found dead in that abandoned shop.”\n\n“Oh my goodness.”\n\n“This town hasn’t had a murder in five years. Ain’t no telling what happened. Hopefully no gang violence or a serial killer. Last murder was in this same location.”\n\nI kept quiet. Either he knew the truth and didn’t want to say it or maybe he just didn’t think it was real. I wondered how many people truly knew. I was always too scared to ask. \n\nI’ve stayed in this town my whole life. I used to drive by the shop and I swore I seen that couple standing in the inside.\n\nAfter a few more incidents, the city knocked it down and it became beauty salon recently on the land. Before that, it sat empty. \n\nThe legend seemed less and less talked about. Every now and then you would see a kid dress up like Mr. Cooper. \n\nBut the reason I typed this, I was getting gas when I seen some kids making a TikTok. They found out the history of the area and told their followers that they are gonna break in tonight and try to see if they can summon Mr. Cooper.",

I feel myself slipping more and more as the days go by. Kind of like when you’re sick, you know? How you’ll be for the most part just kind of woozy and then out of nowhere you’re completely overwhelmed by the nausea? How you go from functional, lucid human being to some shriveling pile of skin and bones hunched over a toilet? \n\nIt’s kind of like that. Kind of like being sick.\n\n“Knock Knocks” dead. I killed him. Well, I didn’t *really* kill him, but he’s dead because of me. So, what’s the difference? \n\nI took your guy’s advice. Who’d have thought a bunch of strangers on the internet would have the answers that our established police force didn’t? I know when I’m wrong, and I can admit when I’m wrong, and I was wrong to dismiss some of you so quickly. I apologize for that. For what it’s worth. Maybe nothing now. Maybe everything if you listen to my warning. I owe it to you.\n\nI feel myself slipping more and more as the days go by. Kind of like when you’re sick, you know?\n\nShit, that’s right. You do know. I just told you.\n\nNo one. NO ONE could find “Knock Knock.” It wasn’t for lack of trying though. The police looked everywhere. Every known homeless hangout, every cheap motel with crack pipes in the sink, every abandoned house and wooded lot. He’d just come around with these horrible gifts and completely vanish. Like the Santa Claus no one was excited to see. \n\nBut when you’re afraid to even go to the bathroom. When you’re stuck in the darkness of your house for days on end, hardly eating, hardly sleeping. Not even wanting to leave your chair out of fear for your life all you can do is think right? And I did A LOT of freaking thinking. A lot of reading tooooooooooooooooooooooooo\n\nMostly just thinking. Mostly just thinking.\n\nBut then it hit me! \n\nNo one knows where “Knock Knock” goes, but you ALWAYS know where “Knock Knock” is! It’s that fucking laugh of his. That endless, awful laugh he laughs. You can hear it from a mile away. \n\nAnd two nights ago, I heard it!\n\nIt was probably 2:30 in the morning. I don’t know maybe earlier, maybe later, maybe earlier. It’s all blurring together now and it’s hard to focus. \n\nI heard him coming up my quiet little street. Waking everyone up with that wild cackle he’s got, and I don’t know. Something just came over me. I don’t know if it was fear, or courage, or desperation, but something in me knew that it was time to act. \n\nI acted alright. \n\nI came running out of my house like a bat out of hell. All I had was my dad’s old .38. Didn’t have my pants on, or my shoes. Same shirt I’ve been wearing for almost a week now, but you can’t blame me, and you can’t blame me for still being in the same shirt as I type this out to you guys. It’s just kind of like when you’re sick, you know? How you’ll just be kind of woozy and then . . .\n\nYes! You know! You know! You know! You know!\n\n“Knock Knock” was on my neighbors’ porch. He hadn’t knocked on the door yet, and I couldn’t see what was in his hands, but I didn’t care. I went sprinting across the street and grabbed him by that stupid mildew-soaked trench coat and yanked him around with every bit of strength I had. \n\nHave you ever heard someone laughing while caught off guard at the same time? Creepy fucking guy. \n\nHe grabbed at me. Sort of instinctually I guess, and kind of pushed as I pulled and we both went tumbling through the porches wooden banister and over the side. A good four- or five-foot drop. I don’t know how I managed to do it, but I was able to sort of spin around as we were in that kind of free fall state. When we hit the ground I was on top of him, and my ears were ringing. I guess there was a moment when we initially hit the banister where that old .38 just kind of went off in my hand. \n\nI didn’t feel it in my hand as I tried to scramble myself from off of “Knock Knock”. So, I must’ve dropped it on the porch. \n\nI had to have dropped it on the porch, right? If I didn’t drop it on the porch, it would’ve been somewhere else.\n\nSorry, it’s just so hard to stay straight with this. It’s like when you’re sick you know. How you’ll be for the most part just a little woozy and then get completely overwhelmed by nausea? \n\nI won’t lie to you guys I turned around with the full anticipation of killing “Knock Knock” right there with my bare hands. Stomping on his head until there was nothing left. Punching those lazy eyes into the back of his skull. Strangling that incessant laughter forever. \n\nBut as it turns out I wouldn’t have to do any of that. \n\nI grabbed “Knock Knock” and could tell instantly something wasn’t right. He wasn’t laughing, and “Knock Knock” is NEVER not laughing. NEVER! As a matter of fact, he wasn’t doing anything. Those eyes were just staring emptily. One towards the neighbor’s backyard, and the other towards the street. I shook him, and then shook him again, but nothing changed. He didn’t gasp or blink or respond at all. \n\nBut as I shook him the second time I heard this weird sort of squishing sound, along with the hollow clunk of wood. \n\nI kind of turned him around, and then let go fast as I realized what had happened, and realized I had been shaking a corpse. \n\nSomehow when we fell off the banister. The wooden fixtures that held it all together went with us. When we hit the ground. I fell on top of “Knock Knock”, but “Knock Knock” fell on top of a few of those boards. \n\nOne of these boards was now stuck firmly into “Knock Knocks” head because if you build a banister, then you’re going to need . . . A LOT of nails. \n\nFUCKING NAILS! NAILS NAILS NAILS NAILS NAILS!\n\n“Knock Knock” Took my fate and made it his! Or I took my fate and made it “Knock Knocks” I don’t give a shit. Call it what you want, but when I turned at that last second, he caught all those nails to the back of his empty messed up little dome and knocked his lights out! They were for me! But he got it instead! \n\nI couldn’t believe it . . . I was alive! I won! I’d stopped this horrible prophet forever, and even if we were all going to die. We were going to die with some damn peace and quiet and willful ignorance! SALVATION!!! \n\nAt least those were my initial thoughts. As I looked over “Knock Knocks” lifeless body, that scraggly trench coat. Those ridiculously oversized boots, those ripped jeans. My eyes met his hand, and my heart dropped when I saw what he was holding. \n\nIn “Knock Knocks” dead hand was the unmistakable shape of an empty revolver cartridge. \n\nDann Orrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr\n\nHe was a good neighbor. He was a good neighbor. \n\nHe must’ve come outside when he heard the commotion just as my revolver dropped and went off. Hit him square between the eyes. He never saw it coming. I’m a coward. Never called the police. The police weren’t over there for long when they saw the crime scene though. I mean why would they? There’s “Knock Knock” with an empty revolver cartridge in his hand. There’s Danny boy dead as a door nail, and there’s a revolver in between them with one spent casing. Pretty easy fix for an inadequate small town police force. Pretty easy fix. Pretty easy fix. Prettty eash\\\\y\n\nYou’d think with “Knock Knock” being dead, and the final prophecy coming to fruition things would go back to normal right? Right? Except they’re not!!!!!!!! \n\nIt’s me now! It’s me now! I fucking know it. \n\nI keep getting these waves of just . . . I don’t even know. Waves of . . Insanity??? It’s like I just forget who I am. It’s like when you’re sick right? How for the most part you’re just a little woozy until the nausea takes over, and then you turn into this horrible writhing thing hunched over a toilet? \n\nThat’s me now. I feel myself slipping. I feel myself losing my grip on what’s real with every passssssing minute and I know there’s not much time. \n\nThere’s not much time, but you gotta no! \n\nYou gotta no!\n\nTherssssssssssss somein in your town hoo nos things he shuldn;t",

        "text": "Hello and I’ve come to share a story that happen years ago to my aunt and other family members.\nIt was a dark and chilly night and my aunt  was in a tent with her cousin Jerry. Earlier that night they’d been told the story of a creature that lurked in the woods nearby their house where they were camping at. It was a story about a hunter who’d gone into the woods and had saw a strange creature with a humanoid figure with a red eye that covered the entirety of its face, and a mouth that was located on its chest.\nOf course they didn’t believe it after all my aunt knew that her dad liked telling scary stories and scaring them. So later that night the two are sitting in the tent talking when all the sudden they see something outside their tent. It was a bright light that shined a bloody crimson color on the tent. The two just chocked it up to being my aunts dad.\nSo they ignore it and eventually Jerry says he has to go use the bathroom and gets out of the tent a little bit after the light had disappeared.\nSo at least an hour or so passes and Jerry doesn’t come back. My aunt starts to get worried and decides to run to the house since it’s nearby. She told her dad that Jerry hadn’t come back and that she wanted to sleep in the house.\nSo her dad agreed and that morning the two went looking for him. When they went to the tents they saw something strange.\nThere wasn’t blood, there wasn’t anything that screamed murder, but instead there was nothing. Strange I know. So they call Jerry’s parents and get the police involved and after a couple of months of searching they gave up.\nThey didn’t find anything, not a trace. \n\nHowever a couple years later while a family gathering was taking place in the same area a strange man that everyone, except my aunt recognized showed up. They were a man with tan skin, a plain old tuxedo for the occasion, black slicked back hair, and most strikingly of all, two red eyes. And everyone called him Jerry.\nHe briefly spoke to my aunt about something however he ended up bringing up the case of Jerry. My aunt very confused asked why he brought it up and all Jerry said in response was, “I like mystery’s. Nice our family has one.”\nSo after the gathering and while my aunt is staying in one of the spare rooms in her parents house, she wakes up in the middle of the night and looks out the window to see Jerry looking back at her. Obviously scared by this my aunt closes the curtains and goes back to sleep. The next morning when bring up the event to her dad he said he didn’t remember anyone named Jerry showing up.\nAnd her dad tells her that there were claw marks on the door.\nMy aunt hasn’t returned to the area since.",

        "text": "Many people know about how unlucky the number 13 is. I personally didn’t believe in the superstition of the number 13 because I had never experienced anything unfortunate connected to it. That was until I got stranded on Highway 13. \n\nIt was late at night when I was driving down the road. I had noticed how desolate the road seemed; I had not seen another car on it the entire trip. I was traveling somewhere nearby and had admittedly gotten a bit lost. Thick woods lined both sides of the road, giving an eerie vibe. Partly due to my own lack of knowledge regarding where I was and partly due to the fear an animal could jump before my headlights in a heartbeat, I drove very cautiously.  \n\nAll of a sudden, my car started acting strange. My headlights flashed on and off, and, worried something was wrong, I pulled over to the side of the road. After parking and turning the car off, I got out and checked the engine and headlights. Strangely, there was nothing wrong, so I got back in and went to turn it on. \n\nThen it wouldn’t start. I tried multiple times, but each time the car failed to turn on. I laid my head against my steering wheel and sighed, “Of course it wouldn’t work when I needed it to.” \n\nI stayed there for a few minutes before a feeling of dread suddenly settled over me. My hair stood as I looked up. I could barely see in front of me, but I could make out a pale figure a few feet in front of my vehicle. It stood there, motionless. Chills covered my body as the air grew colder. \n\nI quickly reached into my center console for a flashlight, but by the time I turned it on the figure was gone. I blinked quickly several times, before assuming that it must have been my imagination. I set the flashlight down and grabbed my phone to dial 911.\n\nFirst call, no service. I called again, but to no avail. Finally, with one final attempt, my call went through.\n\n“This is 911, what’s your emergency?” A man answered on the other end.\n\n“Yes, hello, my car broke down on Highway 13,” I responded hastily.\n\n“Okay, do you know where on the road you are?” \n\n“No-” I began to hear static.\n\n“Ma’am? Can you repeat that-” His voice was overtaken by static.\n\nWhat the hell? I barely had time to sort my thoughts before a new voice bellowed from my phone.\n\n*“I can see you, but can you see me?”* \n\nI dropped the phone immediately as disembodied laughter came from it. The voice was shrill but deep, like multiple people were speaking at once. The call abruptly ended as my phone flashed “no service”.. I grabbed my flashlight once more and turned it on, shining it out my windows. \n\nI didn’t see anything, but the chills down my spine continued. I never believed in the paranormal, and even then I was trying to make a reasonable explanation for it all. Steeling my nerves, I got out of my vehicle with my flashlight in hand. I searched around my car, looking for anything that could explain what just happened. I had walked to the edge of the road, shining the light into the woods, when I heard a twig snap. It made me jump, but I couldn’t see anything.\n\nI took a deep breath, “It’s okay, it’s okay, it was most likely an animal.”\n\nTaking a step closer to the woods, I heard the sound of a crying child. “Hello? Are you okay? I’m going to come to you so keep making sounds.” I called out.\n\nI entered the woods despite every instinct of mine telling me not to. I just couldn’t ignore the voice; it might have been an actual child lost in the woods. After a little while, I came to a small clearing in the woods where I spotted a small figure.\n\nThe sound of crying was louder here, so I knew the figure had to be the child. It was squatted on the ground with its back to me.\n\n“Hey, it’s alright, I’ll help you out of here.” I said as I walked up to the child.\n\nThe crying quieted down, and I went to place my hand on the child’s shoulder. I noticed how cold the child felt. \n\n“Are you alright?”\n\nIn that instance, it turned around. Its face morphed into something demonic, and it leaped at me. I screamed in horror and fell back away from it. I quickly stood up, but I didn’t see it anywhere.\n\nI ran as fast as I could back to my car, praying nothing else would happen. I couldn’t explain what I saw with any reason or logic. After a terrifying sprint, I finally made it to my car and got in before locking my doors. I tried turning my car on but it wouldn’t start.\n\n“Come on, come on, come on!” I shouted before hitting the steering wheel.\n\nLike a miracle the car started, but something was very wrong. I couldn’t change the gearshift. A pit settled in my stomach as the gearshift moved on its own, and my car started rolling down the road. I tried my door, but it wouldn’t unlock. I moved to try my passenger door and even my back doors, but I was trapped.\n\nThe radio cut on, static emitting from it. That disembodied laugh came through the radio once more. \n\nI couldn’t take it anymore and yelled. “What do you want from me!”\n\n*“What do I want? I want your life!”* It responded as the car accelerated.\n\nI quickly moved back to the driver's seat and buckled up. I slammed my foot on the brakes, but they wouldn’t budge. Tears fell from my eyes as I knew this was how I was going to die. My high beams flashed on, and I saw a bridge up ahead. My heart sank into my stomach. \n\nI struggled more, trying to open my door, roll my windows down, or stop the car, but nothing worked. The radio still had static laughter playing through it. I prayed and prayed for something to save me. \n\nI looked back up, and a white wolf now stood in the middle of the road. The car slowed as the radio cut off. I slammed on the brakes, and they actually worked. My car stopped a few feet in front of the white wolf which stood motionless. I cried from both fear and relief. \n\nI could hear sirens in the distance and knew that the police were on their way. The white wolf disappeared before my eyes, leaving me in shock . It wasn’t long after that the police arrived and asked me what happened. I tried to retell what I experienced as best as I could, but I couldn’t help getting choked up on sobs as I explained what happened.\n\nDespite no physical injuries, they insisted on taking me to the hospital to get checked over.\n\n“But what about my car?” I asked.\n\n“We will have one of the officers drive it to the hospital, you are too shaken up to drive right now,” the officer explained.\n\nI agreed and got in his car. Just as he went to leave, I felt an instinct to look to the woods’ edge, and there stood that white wolf, watching me. \n\nI’m not sure what happened that night, but I am positive that something paranormal tried to kill me. I also believe that the white wolf I saw is a guardian or protector of some kind that saved me. It answered my prayers and saved me from that demonic creature. While I didn’t believe in the paranormal before, I strongly believe in it now. Some words of advice for everyone, don’t get stranded on Highway 13, or you might see for yourself why the number 13 is feared.",

        "text": " It was a dark and stormy night, the kind of night that gives you the creeps. I was driving down an old dirt road in the middle of nowhere, trying to get to my friend's house for a party. The rain was coming down in sheets, and I could barely see the road in front of me.\n\nJust as I was starting to regret leaving the comfort of my warm bed, I saw a figure in the distance. It was a hitchhiker, holding a sign that read \"Anywhere But Here.\"\n\nI've always been a sucker for a good Samaritan story, so I decided to stop and give the poor guy a lift. As he got in the car, I noticed something strange about him. He was wearing a creepy mask, and his eyes seemed to follow me wherever I went.\n\n\"Where are you headed?\" I asked, trying to break the awkward silence.\n\n\"Anywhere but here,\" he replied in a low, menacing voice.\n\nI started to feel a little uneasy, but I figured I was just being paranoid. After all, it was Halloween night, and people were probably just trying to scare each other.\n\nAs we drove, the hitchhiker kept making strange noises, and his mask seemed to be getting tighter and tighter. Suddenly, he reached out and grabbed my arm.\n\n\"You'll never leave this road alive,\" he growled.\n\nI slammed on the brakes and tried to get out of the car, but the doors were locked. I was trapped with this crazy hitchhiker, and I had no idea what to do.\n\nSuddenly, the hitchhiker's mask fell off, revealing my friend Steve underneath. He started laughing hysterically and said, \"Gotcha!\"\n\nI was relieved and angry at the same time. \"That wasn't funny, Steve,\" I said, still shaking from the scare.\n\n\"I know, I'm sorry,\" he replied. \"I just wanted to prank you for Halloween.\"\n\nWe finally made it to Steve's house, and the party was in full swing. There were people in costumes, scary decorations, and spooky music. I started to relax and enjoy myself, forgetting all about the hitchhiker incident.\n\nThat is, until I saw something moving in the shadows. It was a figure dressed in black, with a hood over its head. It was slowly making its way towards me, and I could hear its breathing getting louder and louder.\n\nI froze, not knowing what to do. The figure was getting closer and closer, and I could feel its breath on my neck. I turned around, ready to face my fear head-on, and came face to face with a giant spider.\n\nI screamed and jumped back, knocking over a table of snacks. Everyone at the party started laughing, and I realized that the spider was just another prank.\n\nI decided to get my revenge on Steve and came up with a plan. I went to the bathroom and put on a creepy clown costume I had found earlier. Then, I snuck up behind Steve and tapped him on the shoulder.\n\nHe turned around, and I could see the fear in his eyes. \"Who are you?\" he asked, trembling.\n\n\"I'm your worst nightmare,\" I replied, and chased him around the party, making him scream like a little girl.\n\nIn the end, we all had a good laugh and enjoyed the rest of the party. The hitchhiker, the spider, and the clown had all been pranks, and we had all survived Halloween night. As I drove home, I couldn't help but smile at the thought of all the hilarious scares we had pulled off that night.",

        "text": "*Shoddy dialogue. A persistent passive voice. Uninspired characters with no discernible motives. A derivative entity that I like to call Dull Din. I could list more of \\[author\\]’s shortcomings, but I’ll leave the art of meandering prose to him. He’s mastered it, after all.*\n\n**1/5 stars**\n\nI’m a horror critic, and that’s a snippet from my deleted review. Upon reflection, I suppose I might’ve been needlessly cruel. But isn’t that a critic’s defining quality? Nobody wants to read a pandering passage about a piece of art.\n\nOkay, I’m a cynic. In my defence, it’s been a rough year — and the author, who I’ll call Thomas, caught me on a particularly bad day. My wife, Clara, had just left me. And the author’s supernatural tale about Din, his paranormal protector, bored me beyond belief.\n\nThe emailed response I received from Thomas was a little disconcerting, but I was no stranger to hate mail.\n\n**Subject: Dull Din**\n\n*He’s coming for you, Nathan.*\n\nI was tempted to email a reply that Thomas’ threat was even less terrifying than his poorly written story, but I restrained myself. If only I’d exhibited the same self-discipline before publishing that cursed review.\n\nI sobbed in the lounge, gorging on pizza with my dearest companion, Dom Pérignon. I’m a drunkard, but I know how to crumble with class — I come from a long line of polished turds. It’s ancestral. We act with poise and aplomb, but we’re ugly underneath.\n\nI don’t think any of my ancestors have ever experienced a comeuppance like mine though.\n\nThere was a knock at the door. I slumped off the sofa and lazily sauntered to the lobby, unlatching the door. It wasn’t locked. Why bother? I hadn’t expected any visitors.\n\nIt wasn’t Clara who startled me. Yes, it *was* shocking to see my wife on the doorstep, but something else horrified me. Only for a second.\n\nA black ghoul, wearing only a malignant smile, was standing behind Clara. It was peering over my wife’s shoulder, but it rapidly disappeared behind her. I screamed, running past Clara, but the entity was nowhere to be seen.\n\n“What’s wrong with you, Nathan?” Clara groaned, entering the house. “You’re not having a breakdown, are you?”\n\nI stood in the snow, shivering from the chill in both the air and my veins. I thought I might well be having an episode, so I slowly backed into the house, closing the door behind us.\n\n“And now your socks will be soaked,” Clara sighed. “I hate to mother you — that’s exactly why I left. But you should go and change. I’ll make us some coffee.”\n\nShe was right. My feet were frozen, so I rushed upstairs, flung the socks into the laundry basket, and found a fresh, warm pair. As I was strolling downstairs, I prepared my apology for Clara. It wasn’t the first time she’d grown tired of my shit and walked away.\n\n“Look, Clara…” I began, walking into the kitchen.\n\nShe wasn’t there. The hairs on my skin rose to attention, as if my body were sensing something and my conscious mind were simply playing catch-up. It was oddly quiet downstairs.\n\n“Clara?” I called.\n\nWith a resounding clunk, the lights blew. *Every* light blew. I could hear the cacophony of lightbulbs shattering throughout the house. I froze, hyperventilating in my lifeless and lightless home.\n\nAnd then there was the sound of static. Radio static. A garbled, pitch-shifted version of *Every Breath You Take* by The Police began to play. My throat narrowed, and I gasped for air as I realised what was happening. It was what Din had done in Thomas’ story. The demon tormented the family, all in the name of protecting its master — in the end, it massacred everyone but Thomas.\n\nA low-pitched, slowed, sourceless Sting sang.\n\n*Every breath you take…*\n\n“Clara!” I cried. “Where are you?”\n\n*Every move you make…*\n\nI strolled through the darkened house, wishing my inebriated brain could recall where I’d left my phone — or *anything* that could light the way. The sinisterly strung guitar twangs and menacing vocals suddenly fizzled out.\n\nAs I entered the lobby, the light sprang to life — the only non-shattered lightbulb in the house. I pierced the still air with a bloodcurdling screech, as I found myself looking upon my wife’s crumpled, misshapen, motionless body. It lay at Din’s feet. The smiling shadow crackled statically as it took tentative, taunting strides towards me.\n\n“Nitpicking Nathan,” It hissed. “What might we find if we hack away at *your* flaws?”\n\nBefore I had a chance to respond, the entity’s arm grew and pierced my face, scooping into my cheek like fleshy ice cream. I unleashed an agonising bellow and fell to my knees, clutching the bloody cavity in my face.\n\n“You had some blemishes, so I fixed them,” Din said, smiling. “*Shoddy* complexion.”\n\nThen it loomed over me, its smile transforming into a gaping hole that revealed a hellish inferno. An endless pit of torture that I was certain I would enter. But I didn’t. Instead, I received a parting warning.\n\n“I could *fix* more of your shortcomings, but I’ll leave the art of *self-improvement* to you. I think you’re about to master it.”\n\nAnd then Clara twitched. I realised she was still alive, though she could not move her broken limbs. Din grinned at me with insidious intent, and the black shadow expanded, engulfing my surroundings. I watched as the terrifying abomination swallowed Clara’s crippled, screaming body, damning her to an eternity in Hell.\n\nThe shadow vanished in a matter of seconds, leaving me to digest the enormity of what I had unwittingly done.\n\nLesson learnt. Din, you’re not even *marginally* dull. 5 out of 5 stars.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle)",

        "text": "My mom was the president of the PTO when I was a kid, so I got to spend a lot of time exploring my elementary school after hours. The school was originally built in the late 19th century as a high school for a small village in rural Ohio. As the district grew, so did the school. By the time I attended, the building had become a sprawling and irregular complex filled with hidden rooms, twisting narrow corridors, and dramatically varying room sizes which resulted from decades of crude architectural expansion.\n\nThe place was ripe for adventure in my young active mind, and my friends and I would spend hours exploring its various quirks. The oldest parts of the building were always the most interesting. Evidence of the past fueled our imaginations; an old gym floor peaking through a tear in the carpet of the 6th grade class room, or the names of past students scrawled in a long abandoned room only accessible by ladder and usually off limits during the school day. It also gave the building an eerie feeling, especially when the halls were empty and the drafty uneven temperature of the place was more noticeable. This only added to the sense of adventure as bravery became a necessity.\n\nThe building’s old bones were always creaking. Whether it was the boiler room, a leaky ceiling, withering floorboards, or the old plumbing, each sound felt like an attempt by the structure to communicate, guiding us deeper into its long forgotten recesses. \n\nIt was on one of these after hour explorations that I first felt the playful eeriness of the building turn sinister. \n\nMy friends and I decided to play hide and seek while we waited for our parents to finish their PTO meeting in the newest section of the building. I was one of the older kids and I was more familiar with the building than most, so I built up the courage to explore hiding spots in the oldest parts of the building all alone.\n\nAs I searched for hiding spots, I remember actively thinking about how brave I felt. I was a 5th grader now. It would take more than a few creaky floorboards to scare me.\n\nThat’s when I first heard a small skitter echoing in the halls. Being an old building surrounded by corn fields, it wasn’t uncommon to hear mice making their homes in the buildings walls and rafters, but something about the sound didn’t feel right. It carried too much weight. The nature of the sound suggested something small, like a field mouse, but it enveloped the entire wing of the school.\n\nThere was also something else peculiar about the pitter-patter. It didn’t have the sharpness that would usually suggest the little claws of a field mouse. It felt softer, like the sound a bare human foot would make if we were the size of a field mouse.\n\nI was trying to convince myself that this was normal and that I was brave when I first heard it speak. It seemed to come from everywhere and mirrored the small but powerful nature of its skittering footsteps. Slightly above a whisper, its voice was gravelly and shrill, but also playful in a way that seemed intended to taunt and terrify me. It seemed to savor my panic as its words slithered through the halls with a slow, measured cadence.\n\n“Come find creature.”\n\nI froze in terror. \n\nMy frenzied desire to run and my body’s refusal to obey caused desperation similar to the experience of sleep paralysis, but I had been wide awake. It seemed aware that my panic had rendered me immobile, like a spider, aware that its prey has become hopelessly ensnared in its web. It seemed to sneer as it continued to taunt me.\n\n“Come find creature.”\n\nThe spell finally broke and in a blind panic I tore through the twisted narrow corridors of my elementary school as it continued to taunt me.\n\n“Come find creature.”\n\nEach moment of my hysterical retreat felt like an eternity. I eventually made it back to the relative safety of my peers in the newer section of the building, where the torment finally came to an apparent end.\n\n————————————————————————\n\nI never told anyone about what happened, and the school was torn down in 2006. I never doubted my experience, but it also didn’t define me in the way that other traumatic childhood experiences did. It was like the experience was too much of an outlier to take a place of importance in defining my daily reality.\n\nAfter the school came down, I would sometimes think that the skittering of mice in the walls of childhood home would take on a similar nature to the skittering I heard in the school that day. This would only happen at night when I was about to fall asleep, and I never heard the voice again, so it was easy to write off as an invention of my dreamy mind. \n\nIt wasn’t until a couple years ago, while living in a 19th century homestead on a ranch in western North Dakota that the creature presented itself to me again. \n\nI was battling a high fever and awoke from a fitful sleep in the middle of the night to the same skittering sound. The old wooden chair that I had kept in the corner and mostly just used to pile laundry on was now directly beside my bed, facing me. The chair appeared empty, but as I became fully awake, the skittering stopped and the chair creaked as if straining under a great weight.\n\nIt was then that I heard the same shrill voice I had heard all those years ago in the halls of my elementary school. It had the same measured and taunting tone only this time its words felt more immediate. It was still barely above a whisper, but it felt more demanding than playful this time. It felt intimate. It didn’t feel like it was a disembodied voice coming from the within the bones of the building, the words felt like they spoken directly into my ear from a very close distance.\n\n“Come. Find. Creature.”",

You see, Charlie ate worms, and I don’t mean like the kid who would pluck one out of the ground and slurp it down to gross everyone out for their own amusement. No, Charlie wasn’t like that. Most kids would say they were afraid to even get near him because they might smell the worm guts on his breath.\n\nCharlie always ate lunch by himself. I remember watching him dig out his thermos and the normal food, you’ll know what I mean by ‘normal’, but the one thing he cherished lay covered in a plastic bowl. He popped the lid off with a big, hungry smile on his face that was so big it lifted his glasses up his face, he dug through the dirt inside the bowl and found a big, plump and juicy worm that he then slurped into his mouth like it was spaghetti. The worm wriggled for dear life as it was sucked into his disgusting orifice. More than once, this little show made a nearby kid hurl all over the floor, prompting a grumpy old janitor to throw sawdust and clean it up with resentment at the weird worm kid.\n\nThere were rumors going around the school that Charlie had been tested by various doctors at various hospitals. Some kids thought maybe he was psychotic, and the religious kids concluded that he was possessed. According to the rumors, the doctors concluded that he had pica, which is a disorder where people crave things they wouldn’t normally want, like rocks, lotion… or even worms. Some friends of mine claimed that their parents knew Charlie’s parents, and their parents had said that Charlie was put on various supplements and vitamins, but he still wanted worms. His cravings were insatiable, to the point of addiction.\n\nThe school administrators, as grossed out as they were, could do little to Charlie. My friends said that his parents had been infuriated when the principal had made Charlie eat in a room by himself, saying that they were discriminating against poor Charlie because he had an odd craving for snacks. His parents were threatening to get lawyers involved if they didn’t treat Charlie as an equal to the rest of us. Much to our dismay, we had to watch Charlie, from the corner of our eyes, as he dined on his wormy delicacy with the giggling ecstasy as if it were candy.\n\nI believe the following events happened around Christmas of our fifth grade year. One thing that I remember is that it was snowing and Charlie was dining on less and less worms due to frigid weather. My dad had become acquainted with Charlie’s dad through his job, and so, they had arranged a playdate. I fought with my parents about it, to the point that they were threatening to ground me if I didn’t go.\n\nI remember thinking, “God I hope the other kids don’t find out.”\n\nSure enough, they did somehow. I’m going to assume that my parents told some other kids’ parents.\n\n“Brody is a worm eater too!”\n\n“Hey worm eater, how many worms did ya eat today?”\n\n“If you need something to snack on, ask Charlie!”\n\n“Do you have a hard time brushing the worm guts out of your teeth or do you even bother?”\n\n“I think I see the worm guts stuck between his teeth! Ewwwwww!”\n\nYa know, typical immature grade school verbal annihilations like that. I would go home and cry, wondering how my parents could be so cruel. I would wonder what I had done to deserve such a punishment. Was this karma for all the times I had made fun of him? All the times I had rooted kids on while they barfed all over the beaten up hardwood floors of the cafeteria after seeing Charlie woof down a few wiggling treats?\n\nThe fateful day had come and I agonizingly climbed into the car, trying to mentally prepare myself for the horror of what I might see as we drove to his house. To my surprise, it actually appeared quite normal. The house was a white split level with a driveway that had two parked sedans – pretty much like every other home in the area. Nothing appeared menacing about it on the outside, and it calmed my nerves a bit.\n\n“Charlie’s in the kitchen eating some lunch,” his mom said, pointing to where that was.\n\n“Oh great,” I thought, “I’m gonna have an up-close view of him chowing down on worms.” My stomach rolled and heaved, it took all I had to hold down the acidic vomit trying to force its way out of my esophagus.\n\nI slowly, and I mean as slow as a slug, walked toward the kitchen. To be on the safe side, I paused to look around the corner before I stepped even a foot in. To my surprise, he was eating a salad and a sandwich, with a glass of orange juice. I recall thoughts racing through my head as I was trying to conclude what was really going on. I thought that maybe he was really eating worms for attention after all, maybe it was a desperate cry for some sort of human contact, and maybe he was just a really lonely little weird kid.\n\n“Uh, hi, Charlie,” I said nervously as I approached a chair to sit down. I pulled the chair out with caution, just in case of a sudden movement toward a plastic bowl he might've hidden somewhere for dessert. I said to myself, that if he did, I was going to peace out like a bullet.\n\nHe chewed his leafy salad, not looking up at me for several moments, but eventually his eyes moved up to mine.\n\n“Hi,” he said through a crunch.\n\nI paused, thinking of what to even say in such an awkward moment. I finally went for a very 90s thing to say. “Do you have a Super Nintendo?”\n\nHe nodded.\n\n“Well, I brought some of my games if you want to play them with me.”\n\nHe nodded again as he crunched more salad.\n\nI can’t recall what I said but I tried to make more idle talk with him but he just didn’t respond. He just kept eating his food. I wished my dad hadn’t left because the awkwardness made me want to just flee even more.\n\nFinally, he finished his lunch and pushed himself from the table.\n\n“Let’s go to my room and play some games.”\n\nI felt relief when he finally said something, and it was normal, but now I began to wonder what his room was like. Was it filled from floor to ceiling with his slimy, red snacks? Was the floor maybe covered in dirt, filled with the worms? We went down the hall where I walked into a pretty normal mid-90s boys bedroom – Power Rangers posters on the wall, a fat TV sitting on a tiny table with a Super Nintendo on the floor, action figures scattered in random places, a bunk bed used by just one kid. I noticed too that his room didn’t smell bad or appear all that gross. A feeling of regret came over me that maybe I had been wrong about Charlie all along and that maybe I should apologize at some point.\n“Last year, for my birthday, I asked my parents for a bunk bed for me and a friend to have sleepovers. You’re the first to ever hang out with me.”\n\nThat made me feel good but also bad for all the times I had mocked him and acted horribly toward him, for all the rude nicknames, and for alienating him with our cruelty.\n\nWe had been playing games for probably an hour, when he paused the game to stand up and stretch.\n\n“Let’s go to the basement. I have something cool to show you.”\n\nIntrigued, I followed him. I wonder if this was where his parents had a full blown arcade, one that was free and you could play as much as you wanted? I had these crazy, unrealistic ideas that only a child could have. My God, was I in for a shock.\n\nThe basement was dark, except for a few dimly lit halogen lights that hung above three large boxes filled with dirt. They were about four feet wide, eight feet long, and four feet high.\n\n“This is where my beauties grow and live.”\n\nIt took me a few moments, but realization kicked in. He was talking about worms, and boy, do you want to talk about a holy shit moment. Every nerve in my body shuttered and I felt ice cold. My gut churned, threatening to release everything I had eaten that day, but somehow, I managed to suppress it.\n\nI tried to stop myself from walking but my legs kept going. I didn’t want to go any further and I’m not sure why I did. Was it pure curiosity? Was it the urge to have some questions answered? Or was I just that stupid? I honestly think it was a little of all those. Curiosity is a very strong force.\n\nThe basement smelled of earth and something else that I couldn’t quite place. It reminded me of a time  when I had found a dead deer by the side of a road and it had appeared to have been laying there for days, its belly had burst open from the trapped necrotic gasses that needed to escape. This smell was like that but fainter.\n\nI looked over into one of the bins and saw ordinary looking soil.\n\n“These are the beds where my babies grow,” he said as he reached for something underneath it. “And this is what I feed them.”\n\nIn his hand was a bucket filled with vegetable scraps. He evenly spread them out across the dirt with gentle care.\n\n“But sometimes, they deserve a snack as well.”\n\t\nCharlie walked over to a shelf and removed a plastic cooler, the type you would take on a picnic. He popped open the lid, to reveal a stench like the one I had been smelling. This is part of the story that is difficult to write and I had to take a few moments before doing so. Here goes.\n\nFrom the cooler, he pulled out a partially dismembered cat. Its head and back legs were missing, but the rest was there. It was rigid from rigor mortis and had obviously decomposed partially as well. Charlie laid the animal corpse on another shelf, where he produced a large chopping knife and whacked off one of the legs with a swift strike. I was mortified. I had no idea what he was going to do with it, but I was even more scared that I was about to find out.\n\n“Ya know, Brody. You really are the first to come here. I’ve tried and tried the last few months. My parents work with lots of other parents from school and none of them had the backbone to make their kid come over here. Except yours did.”\n\nCharlie then walked over to the left worm bed and laid it down with the same careful way as he had the vegetables. This time though, the worms popped from the earth with a frenzied eagerness that I didn’t even know worms could do. They wriggled and crawled on the corpse with surprising speed, breaking down the leg to bone within a few minutes, then a few more minutes later, the bone was gone as well.\n\n“I trained them myself, ya know. I bred them specifically for this. When you saw me eating them, I wasn’t eating them for the taste. No. I was eating them so I could understand them. I thought that if I ate them, then I could become like them,” he began giggling erratically, “You see, Brody. I don’t want to be friends with you or anyone else. In fact, I hate you. You see, I brought you here to start training them for something… new. I thought, why not feed them one of the worst people in the world?”\n\nI think that was when he hit me with the flat end of the chopping knife, because the next thing I can remember is waking up to a shocking explosion of pain. I was tied up to an old kitchen chair, my mouth gagged with a rag and sealed with duct tape. My body instantly screamed out in pain, but was muffled by his improvisation. I couldn’t pinpoint the pain immediately and began scanning myself for the source. \n\nThe warmth of my blood told me immediately where the pain was originating. My right index finger was gone, blood squirting with every heartbeat from the stub that remained. I looked up and saw him place the finger in another worm bed and the worms eagerly devoured my severed appendage.\n\n“This is the finger that you used to point and laugh at me! You’d call me those awful names! You’d urge other kids to puke at the sight of me! You would point and tell other kids how much you thought my breath stank of worms! Now, you won’t be able to point and laugh at me anymore! I’m going to chop you up, piece by piece and feed you to my children!”\n\nI struggled to free myself, but Charlie had bound my arms and legs with so much duct tape that I just couldn’t budge. Screaming proved to be futile as well but I tried like hell. The chair rocked slightly as I attempted to free myself, but Charlie just laughed and laughed.\n\nHe started walking toward me, playing with the knife in his hand.\n“Time for the next finger, Brody. My children are so, so hungry.”\n\nAnother sickening chop, another explosive burst of pain as he chopped off my middle finger and halfway chopped off the next one. He stood by and watched me cry and writhe in agony. I couldn’t see from the flood of tears constantly pouring from my eyes, but I also didn’t want to witness another finger being fed to those sickening things.\n\nThen, I guess, God decided to have mercy on me. I think it was my tears and snot that loosened the duct tape around my mouth. I screamed for the heavens, Charlie turning around sharply, urging me to shut up. His mother raced down stairs, and when she saw what was going on, she too screamed.\n\nCharlie was all over the news for weeks after. They talked about the kid who had murdered countless pets and had been feeding them to his worm farm, then tried to do the same with a classmate. He was even interviewed once and he told the interviewer “He was the first. There were lots more that were on the menu” as he laughed.\n\nI was eventually able to get prosthetic fingers a few years ago and I can type with them as you can tell. My life has been pretty normal since. I had to see a therapist for a few years, but there’s nothing majorly wrong with me, other than my horrific fear of worms. I can’t even fish with live bait, I always use lures or imitation bait. I can’t even stand to see them if I move something in my yard. It just makes me want to vomit.\n\nThe reason that I decided to write this is because Charlie was recently featured on a popular television series about psychotic family members. His parents starred in it, they’re now gray and wrinkled, and they spoke about how there had been signs of his psychosis but they had chosen to ignore it. They thought it was just a childhood phase. A recent mugshot of Charlie was also shown. He’s now bald and chubby, but the thing that got me was that smile on his face. It looked as if he had been laughing. That smile said he had felt absolutely no guilt for what he had done and that wishes he had been able to feed the rest of me to his children.",

        "text": "Hello everyone, sorry if I kept you waiting. It has been longer than I intended since I wrote last ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10unu0x/the_last_resort/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3),[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10y9aaq/the_last_resort_the_house_always_wins/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3),[3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11441tm/the_last_resort_murder_mystery_weekend/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3),[4](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11ba09t/the_last_resort_i_think_im_in_trouble/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)). Honestly, keeping it together has been taking most of my energy. Too many voices in my head. But that has improved, somewhat of late. Actually, maybe improved is the wrong word. I’m not entirely sure, yet. I mean, I might have a way out. The problem is, is it worth the price I’d have to pay? But I am getting ahead of myself, maybe I should get you up to date on what has been happening here at the Resort. To that end, here is my latest journal.\n\nI smoothed the sheets on the bed and carefully tucked in the corners, making the surface as tight as a drum. Satisfied, I gave it a little pat as I turned to leave. \n\n*Pointless. Futile. Why do you bother? No one cares. This room may not even exist tomorrow.*\n\nThe cacophony of whispers in my head seemed to indicate that I was wasting my time, but sometimes it was a bit hard to tell. In the days since I had inadvertently let them into my head, I had learned that they rarely agreed on precisely *how* they wanted to belittle or undermine me, so often what I heard was little more than a wave of noise and malice. That this was mostly intelligible spoke to their general agreement that I was foolish for even trying. \n\n“Tell me something I don’t already know,” I muttered as I headed back out into the hall and deposited the dirty towels on my cart.\n\n“What?” \n\nI looked up to see Vincent emerging from a room down the hall with his own cart. \n\n“Why are you here? I thought you were on the 4th floor?” I asked. \n\n“We are on the 4th floor,” Vincent looked back at the door behind him, 406.\n\nI looked behind me, room 404. That wasn’t the room I had entered a few minutes ago. \n\n“Very funny,” I muttered to myself.\n\n“Who are you talking to?”\n\n“No one, just irritated that I’m not on the 3rd floor anymore, now I am going to have to walk all the way back down to finish.”\n\n“Are you sure you are alright, Lucy? You seem a bit distracted lately. Ever since…”\n\n“I’m fine,” that came out a bit more terse than I had intended it. “Are you sure you aren’t projecting a bit?”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“You don’t think I’ve noticed you sneaking into the woods to look for that diamond?”\n\n“So maybe I am,” he crossed his arms over his chest. “Why shouldn’t I? It’s worth a fortune.”\n\n“The forest isn’t safe, especially since a maniac with a gun is also still out there, searching for it.”\n\n“I doubt that. I mean, you saw him. He was half dead when he wandered off. He couldn’t have survived this long, alone in the wilderness. It’s been over a week.”\n\n“I wouldn’t count on that. There is something driving him. That alone makes him dangerous, in this place. And people don’t always die when they should, here.”\n\n“Well, I haven’t seen him out there. As far as I can tell, he is gone, one way or another.”\n\n“Maybe he found the gem and destroyed it.”\n\n“Possible. But it can’t hurt to look, can it?”\n\n“Yes! Of course it can! That is literally what I am trying to tell you. Stay out of the woods, Vincent. I’m serious.”\n\n“What are you, my mother? Get off my back,” he tossed a bottle of cleaning fluid down onto the cart with a clatter and stalked off down the hall, to the next room.\n\n*He’ll turn. It’s only a matter of time. Kill him, before he has the chance. It would be a kindness.*\n\n“Uh huh,” I mumbled. \n\nThey were always telling me to kill someone; I was starting to get bored of it, honestly. I wondered if that was a problem. I shook my head, no sense worrying about it now. I had just placed my foot on the stair to return to the 3rd floor when I heard the bell. Abandoning my cleaning for the moment, I trudged down the stairs and headed for the front desk. Standing in the lobby were four young women, wearing sashes. The three read “Team Bride” and they were carrying luggage and gift bags, the fourth woman was leaning on the counter, drinking straight from a bottle of champagne. As I approached, she turned and I saw that her sash read “Bride”. A bachelorette party, fantastic. I suppressed a sigh and stepped up behind the desk.\n\n“Welcome to Ultima Resort, how can I help you today?”\n\n“Took you long enough to get here,” the bride wrinkled her nose. “Is this the kind of service we can expect all weekend?”\n\n“I apologize if you were kept waiting. How many rooms will you be needing today?”\n\n“We have a reservation,” one of the bridesmaids stepped up to the counter. \n\n“What name is it under?”\n\nThe brunette looked back at her companions, \n\n“Alex, do you know whose name Elly used for the reservation?”\n\nThe blonde shrugged,\n\n“No idea. Try Lindsey LeDrew?”\n\n“That isn’t my name anymore!” the bride protested. “It’s Mrs. Timothy Roberts.”\n\n“You aren’t even married yet, Linds.”\n\n“Close enough! This *is* to celebrate *my* wedding, if you recall.”\n\n“Uh huh. Do you have any reservations under those names?” Alex asked.\n\nI typed for a moment,\n\n“No, I’m sorry. Nothing is coming up in my system.”\n\n“Where the hell is Elly?” Lindsey turned to Alex. “She is supposed to be handling all of this.”\n\nAt that moment, the front doors burst open, and a young woman stumbled in, loaded down with half a dozen suitcases. She, too, wore a sash, hers read ‘maid of honour.’ As she approached the front desk, a small case on the top of the stack tumbled to the ground and bounced across the tiles. \n\n“Be careful with that, Elly!” Lindsey snapped. “You are going to damage my luggage.”\n\n“Sorry, Lindsey.”\n\n“What took you so long?”\n\n“I was trying to get all your bags, but I will have to go back for some,” she replied apologetically.\n\n“Whatever. Just give the woman the name for the reservation, so we can get up to our room and start the party. I don’t want to waste a moment of my weekend.”\n\n“Of course, Linds,” Elly turned to me. “The reservation should be under Ellen Pine.”\n\n“Under *your* name?” Lindsey sniffed. “Isn’t this party for me? Why wouldn’t you make the reservation under my name?”\n\n“I… I didn’t think it would matter whose name was on it, I’m sorry.”\n\nI pulled up the reservation. It was in the system, though I knew none of us had taken it. There were four adjoining rooms reserved, and one suite. \n\n“Look, Elly, you are my maid of honor, you should always be thinking about what I need and want. That is your job.”\n\n“Of course, Lindsey. I’ll be more careful.”\n\n“Good. Now, I want to go to my room,” she turned back to me. “Are you done yet?”\n\nI forced a smile,\n\n“Of course, ma’am.”\n\nVincent emerged from the back, rolling a cart. I helped him load the luggage.\n\n“Manny still on the roof?” I asked.\n\n“Yeah, I said I would take care of any customers we got, so he wouldn’t have to climb down before he was done the repairs.”\n\n“That’s nice of you.”\n\n“Well, I don’t particularly want to go back up on that roof again, so it’s not entirely altruistic on my part.”\n\nWe finished loading the cart and I passed him the keys. \n\n“I am going to go help our guest,” I nodded to Elly. “Get the rest of the bags, can you take the others up to their rooms?”\n\nVincent nodded,\n\n“No problem,” he turned to the small group of women. “Please follow me, ladies.”\n\n“About time!” Lindsey followed him to the stairs and her attendants trailed behind her. \n\nI turned to the only remaining guest, Elly.\n\n“If you show me to your car, I can help carry in the rest of your bags.”\n\n“Thank you,” she smiled shyly. “It’s right this way.”\n\nI followed her outside to the SUV that was parked in front of the building. She opened the door to reveal four more bags on the floor. I slung two over my shoulder with a grunt.\n\n“This is quite a lot of baggage for a four-day reservation,” I observed.\n\n“Well, we are heading straight from here to Vegas for the ceremony,” she explained. “And Lindsey wanted to make sure she was well prepared. It is her wedding, after all. I try to make things easier for her, but I always seem to mess it up. You saw.”\n\n“I think perhaps they were a little hard on you. You shouldn’t have to do this on your own.”\n\n“No!” she protested. “It isn’t like that. I *want* to help. She is my oldest friend. And Lindsey isn’t normally like this. It’s just the stress from the wedding planning. There is so much on her plate. It is such an honor that she trusts me to assist her, really.”\n\nHonor was not the word I would use for how she was being treated, but it wasn’t really my business. I shouldn’t have said anything about it in the first place. \n\n“Of course, I apologize. It isn’t my place to say.”\n\n“No, no, it’s alright. I understand, it sometimes looks bad from the outside. My family doesn’t understand either. But, she is really so kind and patient with me. Like, do you know that she still asked me to be a bridesmaid, even though I wore glasses and they would ruin the aesthetic she planned for her wedding photos? She cares about me so much, she was willing to have me anyway,” she smiled brightly. \n\nI blinked, confused,\n\n“You aren’t wearing glasses, though.”\n\n“Well, of course not! Lindsey obviously needed me to get laser eye surgery, so I wouldn’t ruin the pictures. But the fact that she even asked, that she would wait for me to be ready, she is so patient with me. And she never said anything about my glasses before that. Because she isn’t judgmental.”\n\nI tried to keep a neutral expression on my face. The whispers rose in the back of my mind, but I wasn’t sure what they meant this time.\n\n*Delicious. An opportunity. Perfect.* \n\nI tried to ignore them,\n\n“Let’s hurry, it wouldn’t do to keep your friends waiting.”\n\nElly’s face took on a panicked expression at the very idea. She grabbed the remaining two bags and hurried back towards the hotel. \n\n*That one worships the bride. Will see no flaw in her. Is that how Anthony saw you, right until the end?*\n\nI shook my head and rushed after her. \n\nWe arrived at room 402, bags in hand, to find that the party was already in full swing. Loud music pulsed through the door, and Elly’s knock went unanswered for a long moment. Finally, she pounded on the door again and the brunette opened it, \n\n“Elly! Finally! Lindsey wants to pregame before we go to the spa. You have her green bag?”\n\n“Right here, Sarah,” Elly nodded, holding up the smaller bag.\n\n“Well hurry up, then. We only have an hour before our appointment,” Sarah pulled her into the room. “You can just leave the bags by the door and close it behind you,” she called over her shoulder to me.\n\nI stepped into the entryway of the large suite and deposited the bags on the ground, then slipped out of the room. Vincent was waiting for me in the hallway,\n\n“They asked me if we could get strippers for them. How am I supposed to answer that question?” he hissed.\n\n“Depends, do you want to strip for them?” I asked, heading back down the stairs. \n\n“No!”\n\n“Ok, then I would tell them to check the hotel directory.”\n\n“We have that?”\n\n“Sure. It should be in the drawer under their phone. People can get basically anything they want from the directory.”\n\n“Are the people that come… real?”\n\n“Not usually. They are like the Masseur. Most people can’t tell the difference, though. So, it isn’t a real problem.”\n\n“Ok, well, I guess I will let them know, then,” he chewed his lip, uncertain about that decision.\n\n“I’m going to go down and start preparing the dining room. I am sure they will be by after their spa appointment.”\n\n“Sounds good, see you down there.”\n\nDinner was an event. The party was raucous, and they kept Vincent, who was tending bar, extremely busy. The food was significantly less popular, so after I delivered the main course, I found myself searching for other jobs to do. It was evening, after all, and the voices in my head kept telling me I had not yet done enough to earn my room. I wasn’t sure they were being truthful, but I couldn’t take the risk. I offered to help Vincent, but he still seemed a little irritated by our earlier argument, and he told me he was fine by himself. I wasn’t too upset about it, the less time I had to spend serving Lindsey, the better. Still, I needed to keep busy, so I slipped out of the room and went to clean the bathrooms. I was in the stall, scrubbing one of the toilets, when I heard the door open. \n\n“You brought more, right?” I heard Lindsey whisper, too loudly for the attempt to be meaningful. \n\n“Of course, Lindsey,” Elly replied.\n\n“Well, put it on the counter, then, hurry up.”\n\nI heard plastic crinkle and a quick, sharp inhale.\n\n“Good girl, Elly,” Lindsey breathed. \n\n“I try.”\n\n“I know.”\n\nCuriosity got the best of me, and I peered through the crack in the door to see Lindsey caressing Elly’s face, stroking along her jaw. Elly reached out and gently brushed the white powder from Lindsey’s nose. Lindsey leaned in and kissed her, pushing her up against the counter. I quickly stepped back; I should not be seeing this, it was clearly private. I tried to stay quiet, hoping they wouldn’t notice me here, which was probably why I heard the click from a few stalls over. Someone was taking pictures. I suddenly had a feeling that things were about to get very messy. The vague jubilance of the whispers in the back of my mind probably had something to do with that. I did not want to get involved. \n\nI had to wait for an interminable amount of time, until I heard everyone leave and I was alone in the bathroom. I emerged and returned to the dining room. Everyone was now back that the table, as if nothing had happened. I breathed a sigh of relief. That had been a close one. As I approached the bar, I heard a clinking and saw the bride climb unsteadily onto her chair, clinking her glass with her fork. I cringed as the metal clanked too hard on the fragile material, but it didn’t shatter. \n\n“I have an announcement,” she declared, steadying herself with a hand on the back of the chair. “I want to make this toast to all of you, my closest, dearest friends. Alex, Sarah, Morgan, Elly, you are all like sisters to me, closer than blood, really. And I am sure you feel the same,” heads nodded around the table. “We have all been ride or die since college and I can’t imagine getting married without all of you there.” \n\nEveryone at the table had their glasses raised in preparation for the toast.\n\n“Which is why I am so disappointed,” Lindsey announced. “I wasn’t going to say anything, because I wanted this to be a fun weekend, but I can’t just sit here and celebrate with you, and hide how hurt I am by this betrayal. By the disrespect. I was supposed to be able to count on you. But what do I see when I check the crowdfunding site for my honeymoon tonight? The only one who has donated over $2000 is Elly,” Elly beamed. “The rest of you are throwing me pocket change,” she spun on Sarah, “is $800 the best you could do, Sarah?”\n\n“Lindsey, come on. You know I lost my job last month. And I am spending a lot on the dress, the hair, the jewelry, the suite in Vegas, this weekend…”\n\n“That’s enough excuses, you should have thought of that when you agreed to be my bridesmaid. And you,” she turned to Morgan, “$1200? You didn’t lose your job too, did you?”\n\n“No, but Lindsey, you know, my kids…”\n\n“Stop! This isn’t about your kids or your job or whatever excuse you have for only donating $500, Alex. This is about *me.* This is my special day and how can I be expected to enjoy it knowing I can’t even pay for my dream honeymoon? How could my best friends in the world betray me like that?”\n\n“I mean, Linds, maybe you should scale back if you can’t afford…” Morgan began.\n\n“You think I should compromise my dreams, Morgan?!” Lindsey rounded on her. \n\n“That’s not what I…”\n\n“Maybe I should just call the whole thing off, huh? You’d love that. Then maybe everyone would be just as bitter as you, ever since Jeff divorced you.”\n\nMorgan’s face grew red,\n\n“How could you…”\n\n“Come on Morgan, you know she didn’t mean it that way…” Elly began.\n\n“Like hell she didn’t!” Morgan rose and stormed out of the room. \n\nElly moved to follow, but Lindsey put a hand on her shoulder, and climbed down from the chair,\n\n“Let her go, I don’t need unsupportive people around me,” she turned back to Sarah, “And you. You have done nothing but complain about how much everything costs. It isn’t my fault you lost your job; you should have an emergency fund for things like this.”\n\n“For your wedding?”\n\n“Yes! This is important and you agreed! Then you do nothing but complain about how expensive everything is. This weekend, the Vegas trip, the dresses, everything! It is sucking the fun out of my day.”\n\n“God, Linds, have you always been such a selfish asshole, and I just didn’t notice?”\n\n“If you are going to insult me, I don’t need you in my wedding!”\n\n“Good, because I can’t imagine why I would want to be there in the first place.”\n\nSarah stormed out of the room. Leaving only Alex to face the bride’s ire. But she seemed unconcerned, even pleased, a slight smirk playing over her features. \n\n“What do you have to say for yourself?” Lindsey put her hands on her hips.\n\n“I think maybe you were onto something, when you said you should cancel the wedding.”\n\n“What does that mean?”\n\n“It means that if you *don’t* cancel the wedding, and break up with Tim, I will show him what you were doing in the bathroom with Elly.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Should I speak slower?” Alex pulled out her phone and turned the screen towards Lindsey. The bride’s face blanched.\n\n“You were spying on us?”\n\n“It’s the only reason I agreed to be a bridesmaid. I’m not stupid, I knew what was going on with you and Elly. I’ve been planning this ever since you stole Tim from me.”\n\n“You can’t steal a person,” Lindsey scoffed. “He wanted me, not you.”\n\n“We were together for 5 years, we were happy, before you. And he’ll want me again, once he knows you are cheating on him.”\n\n“You wouldn’t dare show him this.”\n\n“I will, if you don’t break it off yourself.”\n\n“Fine, do it then! He won’t care. You’ll see.”\n\n“Yeah, I will. In fact, maybe I will wait until I get to Vegas to tell him, so I can see his face. And so that I can be there to comfort him.”\n\nAlex laughed and strolled out of the room, leaving Elly and Lindsey alone at the table. The bride picked up a wine glass and flung it, shattering it against the floor.\n\n“It’s alright, Linds,” Elly said softly. “You don’t need him. You don’t need any of them. You could walk away from all of that. We could be together.”\n\n“Be serious, Elly. I told you, we can still have fun on the side, but I am not cancelling my wedding and Tim is not leaving me. He’s going to be a baronet, you know, when his father finally dies. He has an estate. Don’t you want that for me, Elly? Don’t you want me to be happy?”\n\nElly nodded. \n\n“Well then, come on, we need to figure out how to fix this.”\n\nLindsey strode out, Elly trailing behind her.\n\n“What do you think is going to happen?” Vincent asked softly.\n\n“I don’t know, but nothing good, that is clear enough. I wouldn’t count on all of them surviving the night. And we should probably get to our rooms, soon.”\n\nVincent nodded,\n\n“Who do you think it will be? Maybe they will all kill the bride together, Murder on the Orient Express-style.”\n\n“You never know. Anyway, let’s clean up so we can get to safety.”\n\nI went looking for the broom, I had more broken glass to clean up. As I swept, Vincent looked up from cleaning up the bar.\n\n“I figured out what you did, earlier, by the way.”\n\n“What does that mean?”\n\n“It means I know you were dodging my question, back on the 4th floor,” he reached up to place a bottle on a high shelf. “You were deflecting. I asked if you were ok, and you made it about me, so you didn’t have to answer. But I can tell something is bothering you. Is it about Anthony? Are you sure you don’t want to talk about it?”\n\nI started to shake my head. It wasn’t about Anthony, not really, and I didn’t want to talk it, either. The voices rose in my head,\n\n*That’s right don’t trust him. He can only hurt you. Don’t let him get too close. Don’t let anyone get too close. If they learn what you are, what you did…*\n\nI was beginning to think there might actually be an advantage to this whole thing. I mean, they gave terrible advice, but that also meant if I did the opposite, it might be good advice, right? \n\n“You’re right, Vincent, I am sorry. I did say I would tell you about Anthony, about what happened. If you really want to hear it.”\n\n“I do.”\n\n“Ok, but let’s clean and talk, we don’t have much time.”\n\n“Fair enough.”\n\nI started clearing the table, using it as an excuse to avoid looking at him as I spoke. \n\n“I had two siblings, growing up. My older sister, Ronnie, and my younger brother, Anthony. He was only 11 months younger, and we were really close, as kids. We did everything together, even planned our futures together. We were both going to become archaeologists, and go on digs together around the world. It… didn’t work out.”\n\nI fell silent for a moment.\n\n“What happened?” he prompted softly. \n\n“It was the day before I was supposed to go back, for my second year of university, and I decided I wanted to go on a hike together, before I left. He was nervous, because it was going to be getting dark soon, but we had hiked the trails near our parents’ house plenty of times, I thought it would be fine. I insisted and he didn’t want to disappoint me, so we went. Everything was fine, we hiked out, had a good time, talked about him coming to the university the next year. But on the way back, it started to get dark. I took a wrong turn, and we wandered a bit off the usual trail. It wasn’t that big of a deal, though, we just had to cross this rock ledge to get back to a section that took us home. We’d crossed it before, but we usually avoided it, because it was a bit unstable. \n\nWe should have gone back, gone around, but we didn’t want to be out there when night fell, so we crossed the ledge. We were almost to the other side, when the section we were on started to crumble. I lost my footing, and I would have fallen, but Anthony pushed me from behind, and I fell forward, onto the wider path in. When I looked back, Anthony and the rest of the ledge were gone. The fall was only maybe 20 or 30 feet, though, so I still thought he might be ok. Maybe a broken leg or something, but he would be ok. He had to be. I took the path down, to look for him.”\n\nI closed my eyes for a moment, trying to breathe. I didn’t want to say the next part out loud. Usually, I tried not to think about it at all. The whispers begged me to stop. So, I pressed on.\n\n“When I found him, he was… well he was impaled on a broken tree, like the other night. He wasn’t dead, but he was speared through the stomach. There was so much blood. I think I knew right away that he was dying.”\n\n“God, that is terrible, Lucy. But you know that wasn’t your fault, right? It was just an accident,” Vincent said softly.\n\n“I don’t know about that. It was my idea to go out there, I made the wrong turn, he saved me, instead of himself.”\n\n“Still…”\n\n“Let me finish,” I interrupted, “that isn’t how I let him down. That isn’t why I feel guilty. Well, not the only reason, anyway. It was what happened next. He saw me there, my little brother, and he reached out his hand to me. He knew he was dying, he begged me to stay with him. Begged me not to let him die alone. I should have stayed, but I didn’t. I told him I was going to get help, I told myself that, too. But I am not sure that is the truth. At least, not the whole truth. I think I was afraid to watch him die. So, I ran away. By the time we got back there, it was too late. Anthony died alone in the dark. Because of me. And nothing I do can ever change that. I can never take it back. I can never make it right. And I can never let it go, because it would mean letting *him* go.”\n\nThere was a long moment of silence. \n\n“Lucy, I am so sorry,” Vincent said at last.\n\n“Yeah, well,” I shrugged. “Now you know. We should get to our rooms.”\n\nI turned to leave before he could see the tears, but paused, just for a moment, as I reached the door.\n\n“Thanks for listening, Vincent.”\n\nI tossed and turned in my bed all that night. There had been something cathartic about talking about Anthony, at the time. But now the voices in my head were so loud I wasn’t sure I would ever sleep again. Reminding me of how I had failed him. How he had suffered, alone. How one of the last things he ever saw was my back, as I ran from him. A cascade of overlapping recriminations washed over me all night. Finally, as the watery light of dawn started to seep through my curtains and a dozen voices all talked over each other about how irredeemable I was in a barely intelligible jumble, I couldn’t take anymore. \n\n“If you are going to talk, at least do it one at a fucking time!” I shouted to no one in particular. \n\nTo my surprise, absolute silence followed. I hadn’t heard true silence in over a week. For a moment, I didn’t even move. What had happened? Were they… gone? And then, as if responding directly to my thoughts, I heard:\n\n*Yes. They are gone. It’s just you and me, now.*\n\nI swallowed hard. I couldn’t imagine that this was an improvement. The one thing I was sure of, was that talking to it would be a bad idea. \n\n*Well, that’s just rude. You asked for this, after all. And now you aren’t even going to chat?*\n\nThe voice was deep and sonorous, and it almost seemed to be pouting, though I couldn’t really tell if it was sarcastic or not. I had just decided to studiously ignore its presence and hope it went away, when I heard the scream. I would have to revisit whatever fresh hell this was at a later date. I threw on my uniform, and headed for the stairs. When I reached the 4th floor, Vincent was already there, trying to understand whatever a babbling and sobbing Elly was trying to say. Morgan and Sarah stood off to one side, talking quietly to each other.\n\n“She was fine last night, and it was… Everything was… it’s too terrible,” Elly broke down in sobs again.\n\nI approached them, catching Vincent’s eye. He stepped away and we moved to the side a bit.\n\n“What happened?” I asked.\n\n“She’s dead,”\n\n“Lindsey?”\n\n“No, the other one, Alex. It looks like she was smothered, there was a pillow over her face.”\n\n“Oh, that makes sense. Blackmail is a strong motive.”\n\n“So, it must have been the bride, then, right? You think she is already possessed and has left?”\n\n“Hard to say…”\n\n*Of course not,* the voice in my mind returned. *They don’t want her.*\n\nBefore I could even address that thought, the bride in question burst from her room, face a mask of fury. \n\n“Are you people serious? Making this much noise, right outside my room, at this ungodly hour? I will be making a complaint,” her eyes fell on me. “Oh, the staff is in on it, too? Is this how you run a hotel? This is absolutely the worst experience…” \n\n“Lindsey,” Elly interrupted, grabbing her arm. “It’s Alex, someone killed her last night!”\n\nLindsey froze for a moment, then covered her face with her hand. She didn’t look upset, or horrified, or even guilty. She actually looked, annoyed? \n\n“Oh, you stupid little…” Lindsey pinched the bridge of her nose. “What would possess you to do something so dumb, Elly?”\n\n“What? Linds, I didn’t…”\n\n“Don’t lie to me, Elly.”\n\n“I’m sorry, I… I thought it would help you, Lindsey. I thought I was protecting you. Why are you upset with me? Isn’t this what you wanted?”\n\n“Of course not,” she rolled her eyes. “This is the last thing I wanted. I could have handled Alex. She would have done what I said, eventually. And even if she showed him, Tim would have believed whatever I told him. He always does. It was inconvenient, but I could have dealt with it. Now you have created a messy, public scandal. What do you think will happen when the police look into this, huh Elly? When they find the photos and the video?”\n\n“I destroyed her phone.”\n\n“She had it backed it up to the cloud, dipshit,” Lindsey sighed in frustration. “If they find that, they’ll probably think *I* did it.”\n\n“I would never let that happen, I will confess!” \n\n“Obviously. And you are going to have to lie to them about why, because I won’t have you dragging my name through the mud over this,” Lindsey sniffed. “I can’t believe this, after all I have done for you, you try and ruin my wedding? I am going to be down *two* bridesmaids, now. What will I tell people?”\n\n“I did it for you, please don’t be mad.”\n\n“I’m not mad, I am just done with you, Elly. I can’t believe I wasted so much of my time on you,” she turned to the others. “Morgan, Sarah, grab my bags, we are leaving.”\n\n“Leaving? But Lindsey,” Sarah began.\n\n“No buts,” Lindsey snapped. “If we stay here until the police arrive, they will probably keep us here for days, we might miss the wedding. No, we need to leave before they get here.”\n\n“What about me?” Elly asked softly.\n\n“You stay here and wait for the police and confess when they get here, so they don’t come after us,” Lindsey instructed in a strangely casual way.  \n\n“Will you come and visit me, after the wedding?”\n\n“Of course not,” Lindsey’s face twisted in disgust. “You killed my friend in cold blood, I can’t be seen visiting you. You and I are done. For good.”\n\nAt this, Elly collapsed to the floor, her tears suddenly genuine and frantic,\n\n“No, you can’t leave me, Lindsey. I can’t live without you. Please. I thought you loved me?”\n\n“Loved you? You were convenient, Elly. You were useful. You have ceased to be both,” Lindsey shrugged. \n\nThe other girls returned with the bags and the trio headed for the stairs. \n\n“Should we try and stop them?” Vincent asked quietly.\n\n“Nope,” I replied. \n\nAs they disappeared from sight, Elly wailed on the floor, gradually curling in on herself, mumbling about how she couldn’t go on without Lindsey. Finally, she fell silent, her eyes hollow, like all the tears had emptied her out. And that was when they flickered, black bleeding from the pupils until it filled the iris, then the whites. She rose slowly from the ground and turned to us. The eyes passed over Vincent before landing on me, they studied me for a moment, then a cruel smile spread across her face,\n\n“You missed an opportunity. This will be magnificent.”\n\nIt sounded like she was mocking me, but I wasn’t sure what she meant. \n\n*I seized my opportunity already,* the voice in my head seemed to respond to her directly. \n\nElly tossed back her head and laughed,\n\n“We’ll see who got the better deal, I suppose,” when she looked back down, her eyes seemed normal again. “Maybe I’ll even see you out there, *eventually*.”\n\nThen she turned and headed down the stairs. \n\n“What the hell was that about?” Vincent stared at me. \n\n“I have no idea.”\n\nIt wasn’t even really a lie. \n\n“Well, we had better get things cleaned up, I guess. The body is in here,” Vincent opened the door and entered the room and I began to follow.  \n\n*Aren’t you tired of all this?*\n\nI paused in the now empty hallway.\n\n“I am tired of a lot of things. For one, I am sick of you, already.”\n\n*That is hurtful. You asked for one at a time, so here I am, just one. You could show a little gratitude. After all, I am here to help you.*\n\n“Yeah, I completely believe that,” I muttered.\n\n*No need for sarcasm. I truly do want to help you. I mean, you are trapped here, so am I. We both want to leave, right?* \n\nI nodded in spite of myself. \n\n*Exactly! I can make that happen, easily,* it purred. *We just have to make a little deal. How about it?*\n\n“I…” I hesitated.\n\nMaybe… No. I wasn’t that stupid or that desperate. I wasn’t going to be making any deals with a demon, because really, what else could this be?\n\n“I don’t need your help, I can find my own way out.”\n\n*Sure, you can. It is going great so far,* the demon chuckled. \n\n“All I have to do is come to terms with…”\n\n*Come on,* it cut me off. *If you were capable of that, you would have done it in the decade plus since it happened, when you were surrounded by support and family and friends. You really think you are going to manage it* here*? Surrounded by humanity at it’s worst, by death and loss?* It laughed dismissively. *But go ahead and try, if you want. I can be patient. I’ll be here, whenever you are finally ready to deal.*\n\nThe voice fell silent, and I found that I was shivering, despite the warmth of the hallway. \n\n“Are you coming?” Vincent poked his head out of the room. “I can’t move her on my own.”\n\n“Right, sorry,” I followed him into the room. At least cleaning would be a distraction.\n\nSo, hopefully you can see my dilemma. I was never really interested in the supernatural, in my old life, but I am pretty sure you are not supposed to make deals with demons. On the other hand, I think it might be right. I don’t think I will ever be able to leave here on my own. Maybe, there is a way I could negotiate something that wouldn’t be so bad? Maybe. Except, well, the voice has been quiet, since we last talked in the hallway this morning, but I think it can tell whenever I consider negotiating. It feels… eager. That doesn’t really seem like a good sign. I think I am going to have to put some more thought into this. So, I will end here, for now. At least it is quiet. Maybe I will be able to get some sleep. \n\nUntil next time,\n\nLucy",

        "text": "While life in many places has returned to some sort of norm, I would hesitate to say that the pandemic is over. Three years have come and gone since the Coronavirus pandemic broke out in East Asia. The events of early 2020, just as COVID infiltrated the South Korean population for the first time, feel like just yesterday to me. \n\nThings first began not too long after the first extensive lockdown was implemented in the rural city of Cheongju where I lived and worked as an English instructor. I was five months into my work contract and in retrospect, not handling my worsened depression well… at all. \n\nMental health is a notoriously undertreated issue in South Korea and I had gone off my long-term depression medication prior to my arrival to make sure that I secured my job. At the fresh age of 21 I was sure things would be fine. In addition to being naive, what I didn’t take into account was the social isolation I would regularly experience in life and work due to the language barrier. \n\nI had been closely following local news as a pastime perhaps only a history and political science major would enjoy, so I was a little prepared for the notion of a lockdown coming to my city. One Friday evening in mid February the announcement I was anticipating finally happened as I was on my dinner break. Cheongju was locking down indefinitely and my principal was sending the staff home with all their work materials in preparation for remote teaching. I was ordered to go home and stay in my apartment unless absolutely necessary. No other instructions were given to me in English but I listened intently as the principal discussed things further in Korean to my only other coworker. Annoyed and unable to translate much, I gave a goodbye salutation and started on my walk home.\n\nBefore getting back to my apartment I dashed into the market next door to get a few essentials I was unsure if I could order for delivery, namely: soju and my favorite cheap cheap baiju. \n\nNot too long after arriving in a foreign country with no local connections, I had taken to getting absolutely blasted and watching movies, dramas, and scrolling on my new obsession Tiktok on the weeknights. After all, I could get dangerously drunk for the equivalent of just four American dollars each night.\n\nHaving secured my loot, I made my way back to my apartment for the night - correction - the foreseeable future. Glass bottles clanged against each other as I dug for my key in my oversized puffer coat pockets. It was bitter cold this time of year and my fingers were losing mobility from the frigid evening walk home. Before stepping inside my apartment I gave one last look up and down the hall. Lights were dim in the open air central corridor and no one was in sight, per the usual. My neighbor to the left had yet to return home, apparent by the mass of mail still jammed into their door. \n\nOnce inside I tossed my backpack onto the couch I used as an extra storage surface and began to unpack. I pondered for a moment what I would be eating for dinner since many local food places had closed early. The idea to just make a simple sandwich appealed to me. After all, I just wanted to do something quick so I could plop down and start the k-drama I had been itching to watch finally. I opened the cabinet that always held my bread only to find it empty.\n\nI furrowed my brows. *That loaf was brand new as of two days ago.* Looking again, I even pulled out a stool to look at the higher shelves my 5ft frame could not easily see. No luck. Looking through other cabinets I was at a loss for where an entire fresh loaf of bread could have gone. I doubted that I had drunkenly eaten it and forgotten - completely blacking out was not my usual. \n\nExasperated, I threw open the door to my tiny freezer, out of ideas of where to look. If anything, I would just spend a few extra minutes cooking some frozen mandu on the stovetop. Squatting down and looking in the freezer, I was taken aback seeing a rock hard loaf of bread stashed next to my boxes of frozen snacks.\n\nI had *never* stored bread in the freezer. \n\n“Fucking weird.” I huffed as I grabbed my dumpling dinner and cracked open the first soju of the night.\n\n# Lockdown Day 1\n\nOnly slightly hungover, I was startled out of my sleep as a loud voice filled my apartment at 7am. Coming from loudspeakers I had never noticed before located above my couch, a female voice seemed to give announcements to the apartment complex in Korean. Before suddenly stopping, I could understand simple things like “Stay inside” and “Government mask rations”, which were of little comfort and felt more dystopian than educational. \n\nI groaned and rolled over in bed to grab my phone. Opening the Kakao app, I texted one of my more fluent teacher friends to ask about the supposed mask rations and promptly fell back to sleep.\n\n# Lockdown Day 3\n\n*My neighbor must be using this time to get renovations done.*\n\nThat's what I initially thought in my drunken stupor when at 11pm I began to hear what sounded to be hammering coming from next door. Only slightly irked, I popped in my new noise-canceling airpods and continued on with some youtube I was watching. The unholy baiju and coke cocktail I had in hand burned as I continued to take big gulps. After what felt like an eternity of noise, I was in just enough of a silly goofy mood to lean back and loudly smack the wall back. \n\n*Whack. Whack. Whack.* My right hand stung from the contact and I wasn’t entirely sure if the sound traveled through. Although, the rude hammering on the shared wall suddenly stopped. \n\n# Lockdown Day 4\n\nI laid in bed, wide eyed, as I stared across the apartment at my front door. Frozen in place, I watched as the motion lights in my entry turned on and off, almost rhythmically. This went on for a while as I watched the empty doorway for any sign of something that might be affecting the lights. The activity had finally stopped for just long enough for me to relax and attempt some sleep when a loud bang came from the wall behind my bed. It was the shared wall. \n\nThe distinct hammering began again with a fury this time. \n\n*BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG*\\- It was never ending. Hitting the wall again, the noise refused to stop this time. Exhausted and still slightly woozy from the previous evening’s bender that ended in typical k-drama fueled sobbing, I put on some pants and the nearest coat. I hesitantly crossed the threshold of my apartment and out into the hallway, still not knowing what had set my lights off. Arm crossed for warmth, I used the other to pound on my neighbor’s door. Some mail fell from it as I did so. \n\nNo reply.\n\nI honestly couldn’t even hear the loud hammering that had sent me outside, once I thought about it. The hallway was eerily silent, the usual sounds of the city barely making themselves audible. I teetered back and forth on my slipper clad feet for a moment before huffing and retreating back to my apartment after one last forceful knock at the door.\n\nNo reply. \n\n# Lockdown Day ???\n\nThe days had begun to blend together and my sleep schedule - or lack thereof - was completely trashed. With no work and nowhere to go, my time was filled with drinking, binging movies and dramas, and the periodic facetime from my family. At one point I complained to my sister about a persistent headache and her response was that I should drink more water than alcohol. While I knew she was right, I needed the drinking to put me to sleep now more than ever. \n\nIf I was drunk I could sleep through the banging on my wall at odd hours. If I was drunk I could just pass out and ignore the continual on-and-off game my motion activated lights were playing. If I was drunk I could forget or otherwise not dwell on the increasingly threatening words I was understanding from the near daily loudspeaker announcements.\n\n*Go home. Isolate. Mask. Quarantine. Hospital. Go home. Cough. Emergency mandate. Panic. Isolate. Death. Go home. Go home. Go home.* \n\nMy apartment was feeling less and less like a home, and more and more like a prison. \n\n# Lockdown Day 9\n\nMore stressed than when I entered the meeting, I made my way home from the brief outing I was allowed during the lockdown. The intent was to get the staff from the school together to properly train them on using the Zoom platform for online classes, a new concept for us all. However, after spending thirty minutes listening to a mask-clad man anxiously give instructions entirely in Korean without an interpreter, I knew little more than I had when I walked in. After a chipper, “You understand, right? Your generation is good with technology.” from my principal, I had quickly resigned to googling tutorials in English once I got home. \n\nI made it home around 5pm, much earlier than usual when working in-person, with some daylight to spare. The hallway was barren as usual, save for the empty stroller by one of the doors and my neighbors growing mail. Letters had begun to fall from the door and pile up on the floor. Even if they were staying elsewhere during the lockdown, what were the sounds I was hearing? Clearly not even service workers had opened the front door to access the apartment. \n\nI sighed and opened my door.\n\nOddly, the motion activated light in my entryway didn’t come on as I stepped inside. The apartment was dark. Very dark. I began to do a little jig in order to try to activate it but when that failed, I turned on my phone flashlight to find the main light switches. \n\n*Click. Click.* I should have been able to turn the lights on and off. Looking over at my stove, I noticed the clock was off as well. The sub-zero temperatures that night demanded that I have access to heat in my apartment. Unsure of what to do, I made my way downstairs to the security guard’s office to sort this out. Perhaps other units had experienced an outage as well. \n\nAfter several back and forth exchanges via a translator app, I was finally able to get the clearly annoyed man to come to my apartment to check things out. Flashlight in hand, as soon as he entered my apartment he proceeded to open a door behind a mirror in my entry, revealing a large water heater and electrical panel. After looking for only a moment, he flipped back on *every single breaker* on the panel. \n\nLights instantly came on and the sudden humming of my fridge reminded me that I should probably check on the food inside after this complete power outage. \n\nShutting the door and making a point to lock it again, the guard turned to me and shook his head. “No touch.” He said. “No open door.”\n\nI nodded, overly appreciative. As the tired and slightly irritated man exited my apartment I made sure to bow and call after him, “Gamsahabnida, Seonsaengnim!”\n\nAt that point I didn’t much care if my broken Korean was grammatically incorrect or too formal. It's the sentiment that counts, right?\n\nLeft alone in my apartment one again, I set my stuff down and opened a drawer to grab my largest kitchen knife. Prior to tonight I had no idea that the utilities for my apartment were accessed via that door. Why would *all* the breakers be switched off? After all, the only time I had not been home and in sight of that door was the hour I had been gone to that miserable Zoom training. \n\nKnife in hand, I began to do an amateur sweep of the increasingly unsettling studio I wanted to call home. \n\n# Lockdown Day 12\n\nStill fairly new to the academy and only 8 years old, Jun-hee often had to translate more complicated ideas he wanted to convey to me. I didn’t mind my students occasionally doing this since it allowed them to more extensively communicate with me while they were learning English and I was slowly learning their language. He quickly typed his message into an app on his phone and showed me the translation by holding it up to his laptop camera.\n\n*“Teacher, your appearance is poor. Do you have coronavirus?”*\n\nMy eyes widened a little and I let out a nervous laugh after being caught off guard. “No, no, no.” I reassured. “I am sleepy -” I used my simple, slower speech. “- and I am sad because we are not together!” \n\nThat answer seemed satisfactory for Jun-hee and his classmates as I was met with “Awe’s” and “Fighting!” sentiments from the innocent third and fourth graders. They quickly dropped the topic and as we moved on to our conversation exercise I glanced in the window showing me on the screen.\n\nThey were right. I looked *rough.*\n\nDark circles had formed under my eyes - so much so that for the first time I actually spotted some clear reddening around them. Additionally, clumps of the eyelashes I had worked hard to grow and maintain had fallen out, leaving stark empty patches and accentuating my already unsightly look. \n\nI made a mental note to order some rehydrating skincare products and fake lashes, as well as to get to sleep earlier that night. \n\n# Lockdown Day 15\n\nI hadn’t slept much, if at all, the past three nights.\n\nUsually I could drink to ignore the odd sounds from next door or the light in my entryway flashing on and off. However, the past few nights had been getting exponentially worse and last night I simply laid awake, pounding heartbeat adding to the noise. I felt shaky and on edge the next morning as I sat at my kitchen table attempting to plan for the next week of online classes. \n\nA loud and sudden pounding at my door startled me in my seat. I wasn’t expecting a delivery, and certainly not a visitor in this pandemic climate. Confused and still on an adrenaline spike, I made my way to the front door and peered through the peephole while pressed against the cold metal. \n\nThe hallway was empty.\n\nHesitantly, I slowly opened the door just in case something was left for me on the ground that I couldn't otherwise see. Once the door was fully open, I was met with a rush of frigid air and a sight that made my blood run cold. \n\nStanding before me was a man who looked to be in his early forties. There was nothing actually remarkable about him, except for the horrifying presence of a mid-sized hammer protruding from the top of his head. The presence of dried blood and exposed brain were unignorable on this otherwise unbothered figure. His eyes were blank, staring almost through me. My own mouth hung open, words failing to make their way out as I only let out a scratchy croak in my frozen terror. \n\nIt wasn’t until a translucent hand reached toward me and he began to move forward did my body decide to do something.\n\nTerrified beyond belief at what I was seeing, I stepped back into my apartment, frantically looking around for something to grab. My left hand landed on the handle of the kitchen knife I had left out on my cutting board and I quickly grabbed hold of it. \n\nSwitching to my dominant hand, I held the knife out in front of me. At that moment, the only response I could muster was a panicked “Hey!” and “Stop!” in Korean but the man kept moving towards me. Without much thinking I began to blindly slash and jab at the man before me, hoping my simple corporeal knife could do something to the apparition. I felt something cold and wet hit my arms and face but the man didn’t seem to bleed. Instead, he opened his mouth wider than I have seen any human do and screamed before vanishing before my eyes. \n\nI just stood in my kitchen, knife in hand, for a long time after that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's been just over three years since I last saw the ghost that terrorized me. I still don't know if he was truly real or not. What I do know is that I didn't kill him, but rather what I thought was him. While I saw the horrifying ghost of an older man, what stood before me and my knife was in reality a health officer who was sent by the school I worked at. Apparently enough of the students had suggested to their parents that I might be ill based on our online classes that my employer had the health department check on me. \n\nMy eyes and mind had utterly betrayed me.\n\nThere’s no use going into the details, but shortly after I traded my old studio apartment for newer and cleaner accommodations in Seoul. After the trial I was unable to be extradited to the United States but honestly, I’m not too upset with that decision. The mental hospital I was sentenced to is surprisingly quite attentive. My once poor Korean skills are nearly perfected these days with all the time on my hands and for the first time in over ten years I finally have my mental health under control in a healthy way. I was even able to gain offline computer privileges last month to allow me to practice my writing without hand cramps, even earning a couple allotted emails each week to be monitored and sent to my family back in America. \n\nHowever, the series of events from three years ago still plays in my mind on a loop these days. I've strained to find something - anything - that can definitively prove whether my mind was broken by a real entity or if it was the years of mental illness, some substance abuse and newfound isolation causing it to finally snap. Regardless, the ahjussi I once saw has never appeared to me since I left the apartment complex. \n\nInstead, Officer Lee Hwa-pyung watches me from the corner of my room as I write this, stab wounds and all. A deep gash across his neck leaves him nearly decapitated. His mouth hangs open in a silent, eternal, inhuman scream.",

        "text": "I spent last summer backpacking and hitchhiking from Knoxville to New York. Having just finished my sociology degree, I figured I’d do something bucket list-y before starting my new job in early September. I’ve always loved spontaneous travel, to just go where the wind takes me; and that summer was the first time I had the money to do so with some comfort. I could stay at the occasional motel, hop on a train, or just take a cab every now and then. I had options, and I wanted this to be a final youthful adventure before I got stuck in the rat race.\n\nI made my way up through Kingston, Princeton, and Beckley; heading north-east. I hitch-hiked most of the way, but I sometimes had to walk for hours before someone pulled over to give me a ride. I even had a cardboard sign, saying “New York, New York!”.\n\nBut man, it gets rough out there. Nothing to protect you from sudden rain, and there’s no guarantee you’ll find a place to stay before it gets dark. And you don’t want to fall asleep when you’re getting a ride from someone; safety first.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy the time I got to the small town of Juniper (WV), I was exhausted. I stopped at a café to get some directions and a bite to eat. Got myself a smiling little blue sunflower pin, some kind of local charity thing. What can I say, the thing was next to a wanted poster of two kids, I felt bad.\n\nAs I didn’t know a lot of the people in the area, and I’d been walking for the better part of the past two days, I decided to catch a greyhound going north. Not too far, just enough to get me to Morgantown. I knew some people there, and figured a shower and a warm homecooked meal would turn my frown upside down. I asked the cashier for directions.\n\n“Buses don’t stop in Juniper,” she said. “We don’t get those.”\n\nStrange.\n\nI stuck around for a couple of hours before I got back on the road. No one was looking twice at my cardboard plea, so I just had to keep going on my own.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy that time, I had learned exactly one thing about Juniper; that buses don’t stop there. And I was about to learn a second thing; that the roads are concrete garbage.\n\nI’d been walking for about… two hours. It was getting dark. I was following the main road out of town when a piece of concrete got loose, causing me to slip and twist my ankle. I fell over by the roadside, clutching my foot, and already seeing some bruising. Now there really was no other option but to get to a bus. I backtracked to a culvert down the road and found myself a piece of rebar that I could use as a walking stick.\n\nAs the streetlights turned on, I was pissed. I thought about calling for a cab, but I was in the middle of nowhere and didn’t know how to describe it. I get anxious on the phone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, just around a bend, I could see a bus stop. Just this little sign by the side of the road, not even a bench or anything. But there was already a guy waiting there, so I figured I was on the right track.\n\nI hobbled up there and plopped down at the side of the road. I tried to bandage my ankle and give it some support, but I’d have a hard time walking for the next few days either way. There was no getting away from that.\n\nAll the while, the other guy kept staring at me. I had no idea what kind of bus went through there, but I figured if someone else was waiting for one it couldn’t be too far out of line. But judging from the way the other guy looked at me, something was off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt first look, there wasn’t anything inherently strange about him. Just some guy in his early forties. Dirty jeans, rolled-up flannel shirt, and a grey baseball cap. The only thing that kinda stood out was his scarf. It was this yellow pastel fleece type scarf which covered most of his neck. It looked a bit out of place, but not so much that I initially even thought about it.\n\nBut the guy kept staring at me. There was something off about the way he looked at me, but I couldn’t put my finger on it.\n\n“Excuse me,” I said. “Do you know when the next bus gets here?”\n\nNo response. No acknowledgement of any kind. No nods or head shakes.\n\n“Excuse me, sir,” I repeated. “Is there a bus coming?”\n\nStill, nothing. I shrugged it off. Maybe he didn’t speak English. But even then, he ought to have said something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI waited for the better part of an hour. The sky grew dark, and I was slowly coming to terms with having to sleep outside for the night, if need be. I had a tent, I’d be fine. Still, the creepy guy was still standing there, staring at me. He wasn’t even checking his phone or anything, he just kept looking my way, pacing back and forth.\n\nI tried to put into words exactly what bothered me about him. The first thing I noticed was his eyes. They didn’t seem to blink in unison. He would close one eye, open it, and then close the next one. And it wouldn’t be a pattern, it was seemingly random; but quick. You wouldn’t catch it at first glance.\n\nSecondly, there was his chest. When he stood still, I could see him take very shallow breaths. There was this faint noise coming from his nose, like, micro-whistles.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt one point, there hadn’t been a single car passing by for 15 minutes. Suddenly, the strange man walked up to me. He looked at me with those wild, random eyes.\n\n“Can I help you?” I asked. “Do you-“\n\nBefore I could finish my sentence, he grasped the bus stop sign and tipped it over. He barely made an effort. An uncomfortable thought washed over me; maybe he put that sign up in the first place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’d took out my phone, as if to show him that I was ready to call for help, if need be. I got up on my feet, leaning against my rebar crutch.\n\n“There’s no bus coming, is there?” I asked.\n\nThere was no response. Instead, he stopped pacing. Not just stopped as in stopped moving, but as in stopping so completely that it looked like he wasn’t even breathing. The only thing moving was the size of his pupils, slowly growing wider; like a cat ready to pounce.\n\nSomething in the back of my mind screamed at me to run, but my ankle didn’t let me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got about three steps down the road before he tackled me, sending us both reeling down a 15 feet slope. All the while, he kept taking these shallow breaths, like an excited dog.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found myself face first in the dirt, with this stranger’s body next to me. A dense pine forest stretching out for miles ahead. My head was spinning, trying to figure out what was even happening. As I scrambled to get back on my feet, I couldn’t stop focusing on this one stupid detail; that his body was incredibly light. It was like getting tackled by a water balloon.\n\nBy the time I got up, my attacker was ready to pounce again. Somewhere down the slope I must’ve dropped my phone. As he lurched forward, I swung my piece of rebar in a wide arc, smacking him on the side of the head.\n\nIt was like hitting a sandbag. It didn’t even slow him down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore I could build up the momentum to swing again, he grabbed me. It surprised me, making me trip over my own feet as he pulled my into the woods. He had this grip like a goddamn vice that just dug into my clothes, and he was much stronger than I anticipated. I was dragged along by my backpack. I managed to get it off and escape his grip for a moment, but before I could get away those hands got me by the neck of my jacket. No matter how much I kicked and screamed, I could see the lights by the road disappearing further and further away.\n\nI got dragged through brushes, saplings, and branches. Things were poking into my skin, tearing at my clothes. I could barely breathe, but I kept struggling. The man in the yellow scarf just kept pulling me further away from the light. All the while panting with rapid breaths.\n\nIt didn’t matter how much I screamed, squirmed, or twisted; those hands weren’t letting up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe battled for what felt like hours. I got out of my jacket, and he grabbed me by the foot. I got my shoes off, but he just grabbed my belt. After a while, I was just too tired to fight. I resigned to just holding on to whatever I could reach to try and slow him down, but all it did was bruise my hands. At some point, I just laid there, exhausted, as he dragged me further into the woods.\n\nThe rough forest floor turned to soft grass as I was pulled into a field. The full moon was out, and I could see all the way through the clearing. The man in the yellow scarf suddenly stopped and inhaled a deep breath; his torso swelling up like a balloon. There was a faint crackle as his ribs readjusted. He was smelling something.\n\nI made an attempt to get up, but he just kicked me back down and put a foot on my torso. At the slightest movement, he would press down to keep me in check.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere were others there. I could hear them shuffle through the tall grass. From where I lay, I could only see the top half of them. There were three of them in total; two men and a woman. Two of them were carrying their own bus signs. All three of them were wearing scarves, similar to that of my assailant.\n\nOne of the men hissed. Actually hissed, with his mouth wide open. He made this threatening stance and stepped forward, but my attacker didn’t flinch. Instead, he hissed back. It wasn’t a normal sound, it was like someone desperately trying to cough, but never quite getting the phlegm out.\n\nI felt like prey to a predator, as they nonverbally argued about who gets to do… something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomething grabbed me by the neck. A fourth one, still wielding a bus stop sign. I was pulled away, and as my attacker flinched, they pounced on him. It escalated into a full-on brawl, but not like any fight I’d ever seen. They were contorting their bodies at impossible angles, their torsos swelling and shrinking like blowfish. They kept thrusting their necks forward while their heads just bobbled back and forth.\n\nIn the confusion, I started crawling. No one was looking at me. I crawled on my belly, trying to get away. My ankle was killing me; every little bump sent a jolt of pain up my leg all the way through my spine.\n\nSuddenly, they all stopped. At the edge of the forest clearing, I could see yet another one. This one was much larger. A woman, easily 6’8”.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe was carrying a bus stop sign; this one of a slightly different model. And she had someone thrown over her shoulder. Another victim.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore I could react, hands grabbed me. My arms, my legs, my clothes; and they started to drag me through the clearing. Whatever disagreements they’d had must’ve been cleared up by the presence of this leader character.\n\nOut of reflex, I tried to talk. I demanded that they listen to me, that they explained themselves; anything. I could hear my voice breaking as I got nothing but vacant expressions in return. These dumb, rolling eyes. All of them blinking at random, all of them taking shallow breaths.\n\nBut this last one, the large one… she was something different entirely. She moved like her joints didn’t matter. She bent her arms back and forth, and she kept swiveling her head like an owl. Her mouth was wide open, like she was constantly screaming; but she didn’t make a sound. Just a completely vacant expression.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe got to a mound at the edge of the clearing, where they’d made a makeshift shelter. They’d dug into the dirt and covered it in branches and moss. It was also a sort of storage, with at least a dozen different signs. Stop signs, bus stop signs, and even a couple of simple benches. This was some sort of tactic to catch people who were either on their own, lost, or desperate. They utilized anything that could make a victim change their behavior. To stop for a moment, or wait.\n\nThe large one dropped a person next to me. An overweight balding man in his late 20’s, with some of the bluest eyes I’d ever seen. He was nodding in and out of consciousness, and I could see deep bruises on his neck. He must’ve been choked out.\n\nAs our five attackers started going through their collection of signs and symbols, I tried to wake the other victim. He was completely out of it, muttering something about white doors and gardens. I couldn’t make sense of it.\n\nWhen he finally came to, he could barely form a coherent sentence. My first thought was that he needed medical attention; he was clearly unwell. Still, he was coming to.\n\n“They… they got me at a… a… red light,” he wheezed. “Pull… pulled me out of the car.”\n\n“They got me at a bus stop. Had a fake sign.”\n\n“Do… do they want money? I-I got money.”\n\n“I don’t think so.”\n\nThere was something deeply inhuman about these people. If they wanted money, they would’ve just killed me. No, they wanted something else, and it worried me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore we got a chance to talk, they grabbed him by the foot and dragged him along the ground. The large woman didn’t even flinch. This guy was easily 300 pounds, but she pulled him along like he was a bag of chips. He flailed and protested; the sleeve of his shirt getting stuck and pulled off on a sharp root. They all helped each other holding him down, as he looked at me, calling for help.\n\nThose desperate pale blue eyes. Never seen anything like them before.\n\nThe large one took off her scarf, revealing a *massive* wound in the middle of her throat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt still looked red and fresh. A throat wound leading all the way into her esophagus, showing the contracting raw musculature. That’s where the whistling sound had come from.\n\nI could see it now. They weren’t just taking shallow breaths, they were cycling their lungs. While one lung breathed in and out the other did so at a different interval; like when you peddle a bike. One foot goes up, one goes down. That’s why the chests moved so much, they were constantly breathing. The whistling came from them inhaling and exhaling seemingly simultaneously, and continuously.\n\nThese weren’t people. These were something different entirely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe large woman leaned in close, hugging her victim.\n\nPutting their necks against one another.\n\nCrunch.\n\nCrunch.\n\n*Crunch*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had to do something. Anything. I grabbed the sharp root with the ripped-off shirt sleeve. I intended to use it as a weapon, swinging it wildly, but I couldn’t get over the pain in my leg. There was no way I’d get away from them. They were fast, unharmed, and could do things that I just couldn’t. So I just sat there with my root, watching the large woman undulate, with something large moving in and out of the wound in her throat. Still with that expressionless face.\n\nI put all the things I knew together.\n\nThey had displayed a kind of social structure. This was an alpha. They had tactics. They need their victims alive, for something. And all of the people I was looking at were just… people. There was no pattern. Just broken, twisted people.\n\nSo I had to try something. Anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUsing the torn-off sleeve, I tied it around my neck; using the blue sunflower pin to hold it together. It was a rudimentary scarf, in a way.\n\nThen, I got up. And before the rest of them caught on, I walked up and stood next to my attacker. The man with the flannel shirt and yellow scarf. I tried to mimic their expressions.\n\nThere was an immediate reaction. The man with the yellow scarf looked at me, then back at the others. They, in turn, just looked at the alpha. She leaned her head back, leaving the exposed wound in her victim open to the air. I could see something white moving in her throat, like a long white tongue retracting into her chest.\n\nThere was a moment of silence as she observed us. She seemed confused. I tried to blink seemingly at random, and take shallow breaths.\n\nI could feel something wet on my throat. Apparently, there was a little blood. Probably from my hands.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe alpha got up, her head bobbing back and forth. She hissed. There was a vibration as something rattled in her chest. My attacker seemed agitated, and he pushed me away. I fell over next to the signs, as the alpha stormed forward. First to discipline my attacker with a show of force, and then to inspect me.\n\nI grabbed a stop sign and got up, letting the adrenaline flow through me. I couldn’t show pain. I just couldn’t. Rapid breaths. Blink at random. Head on a swivel. I had to look like them, or this was doomed to fail.\n\nThe alpha looked me over, making a rattling noise. She smelled the blood, poked at me, and presented her neck. I could see the wound just inches from my face. And all the way down her throat I saw something bone-white, rattling back and forth like a stick in a barrel.\n\nShe reached for my sleeve-scarf, held together by that tiny pin. As her cold hands touched my neck, and her fingers started to bend into a grip, she suddenly stopped.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other victim was moving. I could’ve sworn he was dead, but he was moving now. A long white branch-like appendage was moving out of his open neck, reaching for open air. And for a moment, the group just looked at him.\n\nHis body screamed. Not him, as a person, but his body. A long-drawn out shriek. A grown body crying like a newborn - blood still spurting from his open wound.\n\nThey all gathered around him. But as my assailant stepped forward, the alpha hissed; causing him to retreat. Then, looking at me, it hissed again. It didn’t like me, and it wanted me to leave. Both me and my assailant. Still holding the bus stop sign, I tried my best to confidently walk out of there. The sign had this heavy lead pipe that I could use to defend myself, if need be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got about 40 feet before I realized I was being followed. The man in the yellow scarf was still coming for me, and he seemed angry. But this time, I had a sturdier weapon.\n\nI tried to gain some ground, to get away from the others. Whether they had been tricked by my antics or just didn’t like me didn’t matter, it was just me and this… outcast. And as he charged me to wrestle me down again, I was ready. This time, I swung my bus stop sign in an overhead arc, like I was chopping firewood.\n\nI closed my eyes.\n\nI held my breath.\n\nAnd hit him square in the chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was much more effective, and he doubled over. I just started beating him over and over, as his chest expanded and shrunk.\n\nAs his scarf fell off, I could see something poking in and out of his neck wound. Something white, looking for an opportunity to escape. It pressed against his throat, making it bulge. Like a snake throwing up an egg.\n\nI just kept beating him. I beat him until the white thing stopped moving. Until I was covered in blood. Until the shrieking died down, until the fingers stopped twitching in different directions, and until the head stopped swiveling back and forth.\n\nI beat him until my muscles burned, and my breathing turned rapid from exhaustion.\n\nWhen I finally wiped the salt from my eyes, I was looking at nothing but broken bone and a yellow scarf. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI barely remember making my way back to the main road. I remember collapsing as the sun rose, and a man in a pick-up truck calling for help. I remember a familiar face. A white door. Something blue. \n\nLater on, my friend drove down from Morgantown to see me, and I got a dozen calls from friends and family asking me if I was okay. They also had me take a drug test. Apparently, I’d acted “irrationally”.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust be careful. They can easily be identified. They wear something to cover their necks, and they travel one by one. They use something to get our attention or to separate us from others. Stop signs to catch lonely drivers. Bus stop signs to get drifters. They probably have a dozen other similar tactics. I think they’re learning about us with secondhand information, testing and prodding to see what works. They don’t talk, and they can be very patient. That first one stayed with me for a long time before he attacked. Maybe he was making sure I was alone.\n\nLooking back at it, I can barely even believe it happened. You ever have that one day that is just so different from anything else you’ve ever done? That one day that just feels like another life, another time? That was one of those days. Sometimes I even manage to convince myself that it was all a lie. A nightmare. Something I cooked up in my sleep-deprived brain.\n\nBut then I looked at that blue sunflower pin. The one that held that sleeve together.\n\nAnd I know they’re still there.",
