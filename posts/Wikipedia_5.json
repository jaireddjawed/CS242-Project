        "text": "Not to be confused with copyright, copyfraud refers to falsely claiming a copyright of a work, or falsely exaggerating the copyright term of a work.\n\nI have literally lost count of the number of times I have encountered sites like Getty, Alamy, RIA Novosti, and TASS incorectly labeling the authorship of a work such that it appears that the photo is an \"orphaned work\" with unknown expiration date by virtue of the mysterious incorrect author having an unknown date of death. With copyright terms tied to author lifespans, there is no detterent to incorrectly labeling the author of a work to inhibit calculation of a copyright expiration date.\n\nIt is also important to reiterate here the importance of finding out the year of death for as many photographers as possible to reduce the burden of orphaned works.\n\nSome examples of this problematic practice:\n\n[This photo of Czechoslovak sniper Marie Ljalková-Lastovecká](https://riamediabank.ru/media/628078.html) was published in [Газета «В бой за Родину» 8 ноября 1943 года](https://www.prlib.ru/item/322473) with attribution to O. Knorring - obviously the famous photocorrespondent Oleg Knorring (1907–1968). This means that it will be public domain under Russian law in 2043. HOWEVER, the RIA Novosti photo archive incorrectly labeled the author as \"Mikhail Filimonov\" - I have no idea who that person is, if they ever worked as a photographer or if they were some intern to worked in processing the photos and wound up labeled as author. Either way, beleiving that so-called \"Mikhail Filimonov\" is the photographer makes the photo seem like an orphaned work with unknown expiration date. If I hadn't found the newspaper with attribution to Knorring, this photo would be in copyright limbo for a very long time!\n\nAnother example this from repeat offender RIAN is the mislabeling of lots of photos of prominent politicians that were taken by real photographer Ilya Filatov (1912–1996) with the author section mislabeled as \"Rykov\". I spent hours looking for information about this mysterious \"Rykov\" in hopes of finding more information about them (What is their full name? Were they still alive? If not what year did they die?) only to give up for a long time...until a completely unrelated search for photos of politicians in [goskatalog.ru](https://goskatalog.ru) (sadly blocked in the US now) showed that the photocards with identical copies of those photos of politicians published in the 20th century indicated that the author of the photos was \"I. Filatov\", not \"Rykov\". I was already familiar with some of the works by Filatov (he took a few photos of cosmonauts and lots of photos of politicians and prominent figures), and it became clear that the \"Rykov\" label was just ANOTHER incorrect label! Further proof was found in pages from Ogonok magazine issues from the late 20th century that indicated \"I. Filatov\" as author of many more of the photos credited to so-called \"Rykov\". (For example, [this photo](https://riamediabank.ru/media/3027860.html) is credited to Filatov in Ogonyok magazine issue #6 of 1969)\n\nAnother example of mislabeling affects a lot of photos of aviators from the prestigious 46th Taman Guards Night Bomber Aviation Regiment in the RGAKFD catalog. For example, [this photo of Chechneva, Gelman, and Aronova](http://photo.rgakfd.ru/photo/414370) is credited to \"A.V. Nikanorov\". I tried to find more about the mysterious Nikanorov...until I realized it was another mislabel. At first I thought it was a pseudonyom for works by [Dmitry Baltermants (1912–1990)](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%86,_%D0%94%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%9D%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87), since [Ogonyok magazine issue #20 of 1946 credits him as author of the photo of Chechenva Gelman and Aronova.](https://sun9-39.userapi.com/impg/dEmkRlY2vnAE9pEO7mGlz7HNI3EBfJhZOCJvEg/IOEXskwCCeo.jpg?size=708x898&amp;quality=96&amp;sign=62f492c463ea22ac2858580f6484e177&amp;type=album) However, I soon realized this was a very unusual case of a mislabel being used for works by many different authors - since [this photo of Natalya Meklin also bearing the Nikanorov label](http://photo.rgakfd.ru/photo/414534) was by [Arkady Shaykhet (1898–1959)](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A8%D0%B0%D0%B9%D1%85%D0%B5%D1%82,_%D0%90%D1%80%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%A1%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B9%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87), as credited on the cover of [Журнал «Фронтовая иллюстрация» №5 (103), 1945 год.](https://sun9-67.userapi.com/impg/eLiLfxDAVYSqRrXXcwAXUaFNGn7xrvCmOK9Lpw/kFwtktk-wIg.jpg?size=720x912&amp;quality=96&amp;sign=2e69079ba32f92926d1123abc841cc7d&amp;type=album)\n\nNow, I am stuck wondering how many author labels from my collection of \"orphaned works\" are really the photographer at all! Copyright being tied to author year of death is such a huge burden. Such laws only had big works by the famous creators like Walt Disney in mind, leaving lower-value works by obscure or possibly non-existant authors thanks to mislabeling in copyright limbo.",

        "text": "It's a problem that it is completely acceptable to throw around dangerous, false, and libelous accusations against a vulnurable ethnic group but it's not OK to call said libel \"chauvanist\".\n\nFor beackground - back in the days of the Uzbek SSR, there was this very corrupt politician by the name of Sharof Rashidov, who, I cannot emphasize this enough - was Uzbek. Not Russian. He cooked up a variety of schemes to siphon off central money to the republic. These scams, in their entirety, culminated into the [Uzbek cotton scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzbek_cotton_scandal). One of the little sub-projects to siphon off money from Moscow was the Mubarek project, a plan to \"root\" Crimean Tatars in the Mubarek desert where even the Turkmen couldn't stand to live in year-round (not exactly a good place to grow cotton, but a great place to PRETEND to grow cotton). Long story short, coastal peoples aren't exactly enthusiastic about turning into \"Mubarek Tatars\", so of course it was a flop. And since Moscow was so desperate for a \"final solution to the Tatar problem\", it kept giving Rashidov more money for \"fix\" the \"Tatar problem\", ie, pour more money into the Mubarek scam. After Rashidov died the project was abandoned because, well duh, it was a scam! Crimeans don't want Mubarek. So I wrote an article about the project. I didn't mention Rashidov by name because I was trying not to piss off the Uzbeks too much (long story). But it was obviously an Uzbek project. But as soon as the article was up on ruwiki (full of secondary sources), a senior editor filed a deletion nomination claiming the whole thing was a hoax invented by Crimean Tatars to make Moscow look bad. No amount of sources provided would satisfy them, because in their eyes nothing written by Crimean Tatars or anyone no against Crimean Tatars is worth being taken seriously, and anything that has anything do to with Crimean Tatars is a plot to humiliate Moscow! Such notion is utterly absurd! There are a bazillion more embarassing hoaxes that you can make up to embarass Moscow than \"Moscow let Rashidov be corrupt\".\n\nThis is the same wiki mind you, that when an article about Yaliboylu people was created, it was nominated for deletion ASAP on the grounds that...hold your breath...Yaliboylu people aren't real. Don't mind the many RUSSIAN sources in the article. Because to them, the politruk ranting that Crimean Tatars are Asiatic hordes with no historic roots in Crimea is more reliable than a plethora of pre-exile Russian academic sources describing the coastal ways of Yaliboylu people. The article was on the chopping block for YEARS until I made the mistake of filing an RfC pointing out the absurdity of the claims, and other bullshit claims about Crimean Tatars that are totally-not-chauvanist (I'm not allowed to use that word).\n\nCrimean Tatars are expected to maintain composure and not dare cuss or be outraged when the dignity of the nation is stomped on, smashed, and degraded...but not so much as a written warning issued to editors who spread such vicious lies and smears about the nation! I'm bad because I dare editwar to point out that a Lipka Tatar Nazi was Lipka Tatar (as evidenced by their birthname and family, and being taught by a Lipka mufti). But it's not a problem to just libel the Crimean Tatar nation by claiming a Lipka Nazi was Crimean! Being born in Crimea doesn't make you Crimean Tatar. A Lipka Tatar born in Crimea is not a Crimean Tatar. A Siberian Tatar born in Crimea is not a Crimean Tatar. Only Crimean Tatars are Crimean Tatar.\\* Of course I provided a good source, but that didn't matter because it is more important to paint Crimean Tatars as Nazis than to actually be accurate.\n\nAlso, it is not a \"lie\" to say that [novoross.info](https://novoross.info) is a white supremacist website. Just look at the social media posts by their editors! It's hard to get more racist than comparing black people to monkeys!\n\nThis isn't my imagination.\n\nI'm probably gonna get in big trouble for bringing this up, but hey, jokes on them, they can't kill me if I kill myself first!",

        "text": "On the Climate of the United States article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate\\_of\\_the\\_United\\_States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_the_United_States)), there is a section on extreme temperatures. Most of the information in there seems fine, except for 2 things: the June record low of -11F at Anaktuvuk Pass in Alaska is dubious because it seems like that year that the Anaktuvuk Pass weather station was having data errors. The other issue being the August record low of -6F at Snowshoe Lake, Alaska because when I looked at the climate data, it showed the coldest temperature ever recorded at Snowshoe Lake in August was 12.\n\nHere are some sources:\n\n[https://xmacis.rcc-acis.org/](https://xmacis.rcc-acis.org/)\n\nWhen you're in the page, there are some more steps you have to take to get to the data:\n\nSingle Station -&gt; Monthly Summarized Data\n\nOptions Selection -&gt; Output: Table, Variable: Min temp, Summary, Minimum, Year range: por-por (por stands for period of record, it will automatically take data from the first year data was recorded to the last)\n\nStation Selection -&gt; Search -&gt; Anaktuvuk Pass -&gt; Select the Anaktuvuk Auto weather station -&gt; Click Go\n\nThis will bring up the coldest temperature recorded in each month (at the very bottom is the absolute records for each month) and you can see that in 1971 the data seems very erroneous. If you go back to the Single Station dropdown and select Daily Data for a Month and put 1971-06, and you'll see that the only data from that month was for a few days at the end of the month. You can do the same for other months in 1971 and most of them will show the same: just a few data at the end of the month. Infact, sometimes they are the exact same days with the exact same number in different months (for example May 1971 has the exact same data, doesn't seem right).\n\nYou can also do the same for the Monthly Summarized Data at Snowshoe Lake weather station (same steps as Anaktuvuk pass but different station name).\n\nThe source provided in the actual Wiki page is:\n\n[https://wrcc.dri.edu/Climsum.html](https://wrcc.dri.edu/Climsum.html)\n\nIf you go here, there are also some steps:\n\nClick on Alaska, click Anaktuvuk Auto (or scroll down to Snowshoe Lake). Scroll down on the left side of the page until you see Extreme Minimum, which also shows the coldest temperature recorded in each month for each year, as it did in the other page (absolute records for each month are also at bottom), and there isn't even data from 1971 for Anaktuvuk Pass, the coldest temperature recorded June shows as 12F. Similar for Snowshoe Lake: it has data from 1971 but the lowest wasn't at -6F, the record low for August there also shows as 12F.\n\nIf someone could find some more reliable sources for the June and August record low for the United States that would be great. So far the lowest temperature I've found for June is 8F at Mount Washington in 1945. I haven't looked into August temperatures yet.\n\nShould the article be left like that until the actual values are found or should I just put in some preliminary data and keep looking?",

It's absolutely the ridiculous that copyright terms are tied to author lifespan (after all, the works of obscure photographers with unknown death dates tend to have the lowest commercial value but get stuck in limbo the most). I could write a whole rant about the state of copyright laws. Retroactive ones especially suck. But that's not the point. Commons is NOT supposed to be an archive for deposting orphaned works and hoping one day someone finds out more about them. Commons is not for photos that \"could\" be public domain. Commons is ONLY for photos that ARE under a free license. And if you have doubt about the copyright status of something, DON'T UPLOAD IT. Put it someone else. Mass uploading copyvios to Commons devalues Commons by rending Commons unable to serve it's purpose - being a site for FREE photos. Write to your politicians to demand changes in copyright laws and releases of state photos under wikimedia-compatible licenses. Do NOT throw a tantrum and accusations of \"copyright trolling\" when someone asks for sourcing information of a photo. Find the original publication! If the country of the license tag you are using has copyright countdowns based on the publication date, CITE to a publication of the work that is before the cutoff date! Just because a photo is over 70 years old doesn't mean it's public domain!\n\nIt is not trolling to try to keep copyright violations off Commons. Don't like your photos getting deleted? Cite to the original publication! Prove your photo was published before the cutoff! Wishing that your country has better copyright laws doesn't magically make a photo public domain!",
