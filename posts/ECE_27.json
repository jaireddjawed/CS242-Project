        "text": "I want to get a full, intuitive grasp of Ohm's Law. I can apply it to circuits and solve for unknowns, but I feel as if I don't truly KNOW why it holds. I've just been applying it without actually knowing what it really MEANS.\nMy confusion comes because of the comparison to electric potential to gravitational potential. If I have a bottle of water that I am pouring out at a certain height, then I move the bottle of water up even higher, it has a greater gravitational potential because it is higher. However, in this case, the water would not come out of the water bottle any faster simply because I moved it up, would it? And even though the extra height would give the water more time to accelerate, wouldn't that simply mean the individual water droplets get spaced out more as they fall, so the increase in speed is counteracted by the increase in distance between water droplets, thus current does not change?\nIn a circuit, if I simply increase the difference in how much potential energy a coulomb of charge has between two points (like increasing height), why would that mean that more charge flows between those two points? Like in the gravitational potential comparison, I would expect the two to not be directly related (if related at all).",

I am very new to firmware programming but have some previous AVR experience with Assembly and such, so I have an understanding of low-level workings.  \n  \nI downloaded and started with Atollic TrueSTUDIO and installed Cube and CubeMX, and configured my particular microcontroller graphically, setting desired clock times and such. I generated all of the skeleton code, and it just turned out to be a ton of files for interfaces such as \"spi.c\", \"i2c.c\", \"uart.c\", etc. I am completely lost on where to write the code i need to and even once I've written things, how to compile and what to actually upload to the microcontroller and how to do it. I would really appreciate any feedback on how to get started with this, I'm feeling very lost right now.",

        "text": "Hi, I am entering my (possibly) last quarter at a top SoCal school.\nI am currently entertaining 3 prospects for my future.\n\n1. Last fall I applied to the ASU MSE program and was accepted. That was the only school I applied to because I didn't have anyone good to ask for letters of rec (they don't take any) and a low gpa. I would be entering in the electromagnetics track. I am concerned that the MSE program is too large (like 800 students) and I won't be able to find any research opportunities or an advisor for an MS thesis. I think a thesis degree would be better for the type of work I want to do (R&amp;D electromagnetics/antennas), and it would give me a better opportunity to go for a PHD.\n\n2. At the beginning of the school year I was also able to find a good undergraduate research opportunity at my school and will likely get a co-authorship in a journal publication by a June graduation. This is in a bit of a different field and pretty application focused, but still has some tangential ties to the area I am primarily interested in (electromagnetics). I am considering staying with the group over summer and into the Fall quarters (at least) to potentially get another publication and a strong letter of rec from the PI (I have improved my academics and habits and could also get another 2 letters of rec to round out my application). I think I could have a shot at some decent PHD programs, or at least very solid MS programs with an end-of-Fall quarter application.\n\n3. I was recently offered an entry level job at a large defense contractor in the Midwest. This is an an area I'm very interested (radar cross section), but I'm not interested in staying in the Midwest for very long and the pay is pretty low. I wasn't planning on going right into industry, but I applied to the job in passing because the work sounded very interesting. I don't have any other offers on the table.\n\nI'm hoping you guys could provide some insight as to the merits of these options and maybe share some of your similar experiences/how you made these kinds of decisions. Thanks.\n",

        "text": "This isn't really a problem/hw question, but I wanted some clarification on this topic. In an energy band diagram like the one I drew below, what determines the size of the conduction band and valence band? Etop - Ec and or Ev - Ebot? Is that just a property of the material? Also, how do electrons choose where to go inside the conduction band(or valence band)? What I mean is if an electron gets enough energy to go from the valence band to the conduction band, how does it decide to stay towards the bottom of the band vs the middle or close to the top?  **Edit*** Or how/why are electrons and holes at different energies in the valence band?  And why can't they leave the top of the conduction band?  Or the bottom of the valence band?  \n\nEnergy bands come from a bunch of atoms together and we are looking at top view I guess (the valence shell of each atom together) and that is what forms our valence band and conduction band, correct? But in the band diagram of an atom I thought we can only be at the valence band and not above or below or between, but strictly at the band. There are no energy states inbetween the bands I mean. You can only be at one or the other. Is my understanding of this incorrect? \n\n\n\nAlso, for a big picture view of everything, how does the energy diagram correspond to our physical material? For example, if we have a chunck or block of intrinsic silicon, where is this energy band with respect to that chunck of silicon? I don't know if my question is making sense, but I guess another way to put it, where is the valence band and conduction band in our physical chunk of material?\n\nEdit*\nIf we are looking at some [intrinsic silicon](https://imgur.com/a/0UFz2) for example, how does the energy gap relate to this?\n\n\n#**[HERE IS THE PICTURE](https://imgur.com/a/fPbhf)**",

I have the ECE page for that pulled up currently, I haven't gone through it just yet. I don't know much about them either having just started looking at them. So far, I'm not seeing anything I don't like and the same goes for NCSU. I was hoping for similar as in NCSU, someone in this sub having been there or currently is; or someone who might know a thing or two about the university.\n\nAll in all, thanks for your time in reading this and hopefully giving me some information on the subject.

        "text": "TLDR at bottom \n\n\n**Background:**\nFreshmen EE/CE student … Related coursework (?) Circuits, CS 1 and 2, currently taking Data Structures and Digital Logic. \n\n\n**Why am I interested?**\nI recently saw someone playing with an Arduino and I was just excited to see one and wanted to use it. The only experience I have had with the Tiva Launchpad was a few years ago when I played with it for a bit and made lights flash like a siren and the blinky program. During that time, I had someone who knew what they were doing helping me but being a lazy HS I kind of just gave up after I got confused. \n\n\n**Currently:**\nI recently was able to get my hands on a Tiva C Series LaunchPad. I have spent maybe week or two just going through the pdfs and links found at the website, but it is overwhelming. There are a lot of files and pdf and I am really confused as to which are \"more\" important to read first, which actually provide info that will be frequently used, etc. I have also found the TI-RTOS workshop videos, but I am not sure if they are the right videos to help me? I have also found a playlist on YouTube which I think may help guide through the process? I will have to work with micro-controllers at some point (or at least I hope I do ) so I wouldn't mind starting now and learning as much as I can. I understand it may be arrogant to think that I can just pick up the Tiva board and just start so that's why I have come here to ask for help. \n\n\n**Questions:** \nWhat should I read (textbooks), watch, or understand to prepare me for taking the steps towards using micro-controllers? What’s the bare minimum knowledge someone should have and where can I find it?  If someone wouldn't mind helping me I really would like to learn, and I know these posts may seem lazy, but I'm just overwhelmed with all the stuff out there I don't know where to begin. I have asked one of my professors who has a lot of experience with MC’s, but I don't want to just go in empty handed expecting hand me outs (even though I am kind of doing this here sorry).  I code a majority in C++ and use CLion. From what I read I will have to use a specialized IDE and C, any resources that could help in that transitions would be great too. \n\n\n**TL;DR Help me learn Tiva Launchpad please** \n\n\n\nhttp://www.ti.com/tool/EK-TM4C123GXL#technicaldocuments\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkAT9MXh8UY&amp;index=7&amp;list=PLmfT_cdP5PYBWYvK_bCdGyBqQEiRzUPeq\nhttps://training.ti.com/ti-rtos-workshop-series-1-10-welcome\n",

And of course now everything is either a pure CMOS or BiCMOS process for logic. But its so interesting to see ISAs we all know like MIPS being experimented with as late as 1990.

        "text": "Hello guys,\n\nI am preparing for my Computer Science major entrance exam and was wondering if someone could clear up some concepts for me. I consluted my book, but some stuff still isn't really clear for me. I'll label the questions as they come in the exam.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow many cycles does this program take? Memory and branch instructions take 2 cycles, arithmetic and register instructions take 1 cycle. Branch always takes 2 cycles, no matter if the condition is met or not.\n\n             MOVE R2, %d 100\n             MOVE R4,%d 1000\n    LOOP LOAD R3,(R2)\n             ADD R2,4,R2\n             SUB R4,1,R4\n             JR_NZ PETLJA\n      END HALT\n\n**My answer:** 6003. Here's how: 2 (for the 2 MOVE instructions) + 6 * 1000 (the loop which executes 1000 times and has 6 cycles within itself) + 1 (for the HALT)\n\nSome questions on this:\n\n - Am I correct?\n - Does HALT take 1 cycle?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n24. Let a processor have 5 pipeline stages:\n\n    Fetch\n    Decode\n    Execute ALU operations\n    Memory access\n    Saving results in registers\n\nIn that processor we can expect the following hazards (answers delimited by a *semicolon* (not colon)):\n\nStack hazard, Control hazard; Von-Neuman Hazard, Stack hazard; Harward hazard, Register hazard; Control hazard, Data hazard; Register hazard, Stack hazard.\n\n**My answer:** Control hazard, Data hazard (assuming data hazard is structural hazard, which occurs when we want to fetch an instruction and perform memory access at the same time.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n30. We have a network topology as pictured [here](https://imgur.com/a/kQHYS). All DNS servers work iteratively. `dns.tel.fer.hr` and PC1 are a part of the domain `tel.fer.hr`. `www.hr` is in `dns.hr`'s jurisdiction. Top-level domain server is `i-root.servers.net`. PC1 tries to access `www.hr` using its canonical name. *Note: I abbreviated the task text, but mostly because the text describes the picture.* What happens?\n\nNote: I revisited my computer networks textbook, and it says (I qoute) : \"In practice, the queries typically follow the pattern in Figure 2.21: The query from the requesting host to the local DNS server is recursive, and the remaining queries are iterative.\" (I did not include Figure 2.21).\n\nSo, based on that note above, my answer goes like this:\n\n1. PC1 sends a query to `dns.tel.fer.hr`;\n2. `dns.tel.fer.hr` sends a query to top-level domain server (`i.root-servers.net`);\n3. `dns.tel.fer.hr` sends a query to `dns.hr`.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong.

Like Pozar or Razavi, that shit is expensive. Same with Mixed Signal design, even though that book is like thin and short. Balanis is the only one I could imagine paying its original price for, but that thing is a Goliath 18 chapter book. \n\nSeriously, you guys can buy these books, download LTSpice and Octave/Python and just work away at it for under $100 and get yourself an IC design position. I'm sure Weste/Harris has one too. That means Analog, Digital, Power, RF, Mixed Signal IC design positions are open for like under $150 I think altogether. You guys just have to put in the time, some of these are the leading references, best in class textbooks. I mean they aren't cutting edge graduate material, but Senior Year/1st Year Grad level material. \n\n\n*Cough cough*, you didn't hear it from me *cough cough*. A little birdie told you this. Maybe youz guyz get these books and get yourselves a nice cushy Silicon Valley IC design job. \n\nI don't know if this is **legal**, or if most EE/CEs here frown on this. But it *is* on Amazon, most with PRIME shipping. \n\nI mean *cough cough* I need to get my throat checked up. ",
