        "text": "Was wondering which assembly language people recommended to learn. I have poured through here, /r/Malware and stackoverflow and I have collected some good resources for languages such as MIPS, ARM, x86-64, and RISC. \n\nI want to learn one because it seems fun and I want a deeper understanding of what's happening at HLL and with computers in general. \n\nAt the same time I also would like to know what is the most practical and useful for now and the future. I assume ARM and MIPS fall into this category. \n\nReasons can be tied to malware and reverse engineering, other more anecdotal instances like someone who used it with his friends to extend some trial version software, or based on where I'd use it (e.g. MIPS with MAC or ARM with Android and more for mobile devices). \n\nAlso feel free to let me know if this is a shitty self-post and I need to ask somewhere else such as /r/learnprogramming. After doing research of old posts and other places online this seemed like a good place to get more up to date information. \n\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to thank everyone for commenting and giving me good information and feedback. The way I see it I will:\n\n1. Learn more about IO, memory, processors, ABIs, etc. to build a background understanding.\n\n2. Then begin to learn x86 due its accessibility and practicability in terms of desktop, servers, and implementation. \n\n3. Eventually learn ARM due to its ubiquitous nature in the realm of mobiles which will only grow, and once I have specific projects and uses for it. \n\n(Also I read an article and I can see Apple over the next decade trying to improve its ARM based hardware aka Cyclone and shift to that if it is more lucrative and for the sake of control, rather than maintaining windows compatibility, etc.)",

        "title": "What are potential disadvantages of functional programming? For which areas does functional programming work best and for which ones not?",
        "author": "BlackSalamandra",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/6pnq7e/what_are_potential_disadvantages_of_functional/",
        "text": "I am wondering what other people experience as disadvantages of functional programming? (**edit:** with this I mean avoiding [side effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_%28computer_science%29) in functions, or, in FP jargon, making extensive use of \"[referential transparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency)\" where possible and practical, see below).\n\nOf course one can define functional programming so that *no* local mutable state and *no* side effects are possible, and then point out the obvious disadvantages. But that's perhaps a [\"no true Scotsman\" kind of argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman). If you would define object-oriented programming with the same strictness, everything that is not an object and uses mutable values would be forbidden. Even something such as y = sin(x), copy-on-write or returning constant objects or containers from a function would be off-limits. That is, I am asking with a very pragmatic definition of FP in mind!\n\nWhat I am wondering is rather, do you observe pragmatic functional programming as  [John Carmack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmack) described it  [here](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/169296/Indepth_Functional_programming_in_C.php) -- for C++! -- as valuable? And of course this question goes also to people who have tried it to some extend, as a purely theoretical discussion would be boring. I am interested in good examples!\n\nI think there are also several interrelated but not strictly connected issues, like immutability, GC, memory safety, immutable data structures and so on, so it could be valuable to mention the point of view and background you are using as a reference. \n\nAnother question I am wondering is, for what kind of programming and level is functional programming turning out more, or less, useful for people? Some critics mention systems programming but even this is a wide notion - writing docker code, a HTTP library or a compiler is obviously not the same as writing a filesystem, a process scheduler, or a network driver.\n\nThere is at least one area where I think that everyone is using FP to some extend, but not everyone knows: It is the area of data analysis and numerical computation. Whether you use MATLAB, Numerical Python, LAPACK, R, the [GNU scientific library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Scientific_Library) or even a spreadsheet: In all these cases, input is never modified.\n\n(To describe my own background, I know reasonably well C, C++98, Go, Java, Numerical Python, MATLAB, R, Clojure, some Scala, Rust basics, Pascal,  IEC 61131-3 Structured Text, a bit of FORTH and some other things which have been lost in some dark corners of my memory).\n\n**Edit:** /u/PM_ME_UR_OBSIDIAN made an important observation which I want to mention here for matters of an efficient discussion - saying what matters is probably not immutability by itself but [referential transparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency).\n\n\n**Edit2** I want to sum up a few points which might be interesting for further discussion:\n\n1. Familarity / mindshare: Functional languages are less well-known, this can be a hurdle. But functional concepts and features are definitively seeping into mainstream programming languages, that means somebody who learns a functional language can use these features better. (**edit:** People less familiar with functional programming and how to preserve referential transparency often think that functional programming is **not suited to program models of the outer world, such as simulations**, or systems which are often modeled by OOP approaches. It seems to turn out that in the domain of modeling / simulation, the functional approach seems to require serious re-thinking on how changing state is handled and what is represented in a program. However there are good examples and explanations how this can be done, see for example [this essay on state and identiy](https://clojure.org/about/state), or this [example on how to model and simulate  a rocket](https://aphyr.com/posts/312-clojure-from-the-ground-up-modeling). )\n\n2. There seems to be consensus that functional approaches make it easier to reason about behavior of code but using them has some learning curve. The learning curve seems steeper when you go to static languages and to strict referential transparency even within each function.\n\n3. Conciseness: Functional code apparently tends to be more dense which has both advantages and disadvantages. Generally, a higher density seems to reduce significantly the cognitive load for experienced programmers, while it can make it more difficult for unexperienced programmers to understand the code. \n\n\n\n4. Concurrency. It seems that FP has advantages for concurrent code, especially if performance is I/O bound. It is, however, not the only possible approach, and certainly no silver bullet as silver bullets don't exist outside of fairy tales.\n\n5. One area I want to draw a bit of attention to is that, to me, functional languages seem to be more source-code centric and tend to have less layers of abstraction than typical object-oriented code - in my experience, sometimes surprisingly less. (Personally, I think the push for OOP in the nineties came also from the activities to lock programmers and users into platforms which rely on very heavy native GUI libraries. OOP seems to map relatively well to graphical user interfaces and given the commercial incentive it is probably not by chance that entire operating systems have been named according to graphical user interfaces. That incentive to platform vendors, however does not mean that thick layers of libraries with many levels of heavy abstractions are the best approach to efficiently writing programs. One could certainly argue that this is not good for performance either).\n\n6. Determinism: Functional languages seem to be less deterministic and less suited for constrained real-time environments. They appear to be especially well-suited for data processing on a higher level, which may include web applications.\n\n7. Somebody gave an example that FP language might increase the risk for certain types of bugs: https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/6pnq7e/what_are_potential_disadvantages_of_functional/dksa6hf/ - I'd be highly interested to learn more about that!\n\n8. Performance: This is frequently seen as the biggest disadvantage. It is argued that functional languages are less efficient because they do not map as good to the underlying machine. I think this has three aspects: Functions, values, and memory. \n\n    Regarding functions, I think it is absolutely possible to represent CPU register operations as functions (usually with multiple input, and multiple output), and compile down to them, and many implementations of functional languages do (SBCL, Chez Scheme, Pixie, Racket). On the other hand, Clojure is in the same range as Java which is today for some benchmarks about a factor two slower than C. \n\n    Regarding values: Functional languages prefer values over mutable objects. Values with 32 or 64 bits of data can be represented as registers and modern CPUs have plenty of them - certainly more than an average programmer can juggle in his head. Modern CPUs also support 128-bit values which are less well supported by today's platforms and compilers, but this is a technical detail. So this comes down to compiler issues, and compilers are steadily becoming better. It seems to me that functional languages apart from Rust are *not yet* recommendable for highly performance-critical code, but this might change in the future.\n\n    The third issue related to performance is memory, and this is more complex. Functional languages often use garbage collection (GC), and this has of course a cost. Garbage collection or reference counting has advantages and is used in most newer imperative languages as well. Garbage collection can be heavily optimized, as the hotspot JVM and Go's escape analysis show. And GC is not mandatory for a functional approach as the example of Rust shows. My take is that memory / GC performance depends a lot on the runtime environment. I also think that what is useful for code which needs high performance is probably a layered approach perhaps with low-level imperative implementations of computing-intensive functions, and \"pure\" or side-effect free high-level functions and application code. Such would, for example, be supported by a combination of Racket code calling into Rust code.\n\n    Also, this comments gives positive examples on FP performance: https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/6pnq7e/what_are_potential_disadvantages_of_functional/dks9i0c/\n\n    As an addition to the performance discussion, this page shows pixie, a language forked from Clojure, to compile a loop down to 6 CPU instructions: https://github.com/pixie-lang/pixie . Also interesting: the benchmarks in http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/ .\n\n**Edit3:** \n\n* To clear up some potential misconception, I **do** think that functional approaches can have a performance disadvantage (depending on the domain, level of application, and not counting Rust). I do relate that largely to memory management more heavily using GC (which might be wrong - I am only aware of a very small piece of the whole picture). What I am interested in is **when do performance differences matter?** Do we need to write everything in assembly? And of course, are there possibly cases where performance is better?\n\n**Edit4:** A few more points some of which were mentioned at /r/cpp :\n\n* There is the idea that functional languages are more attractive / better matching the mind of people which are more mathematically inclined, because they are more focused on abstractions and expressions. This might or might not be correlated to use of functional languages in data science and data analysis.\n* Some people think functional approaches can be used well in languages like C++11 and some think they are a poor match. I guess what would be most helpful here would be illustrative examples (personally, I would not even dream to claim that I understand \"Modern C++\" well enough to make any definite statement about such issues.)\n* there are quite different opinions on how well functional languages match database access. Some argue that accesses are stateful and functional languages/approaches can't match them, some say that SQL statements are themselves like expressions (I am wondering whether this is true for LINQ). **edit:** People which are familiar with functional languages tend to reject the idea that functional approaches or functional lanugages cannot handle database access easily.\n* As somebody mentioned, Leslie Lamport noted that functional languages don't make the difficulties of distributed systems go away. (I would be curious how libraries like Akka make distributed computation more manageable and what the relation to functional programming is). (**edit:** talking distributed systems, I think I should mention [Kyle Kingsburys Jepsen project](https://aphyr.com/tags/Jepsen) which uses Clojure for testing of consistency and correctenss issues in distributed databases)\n* It is harder to estimate performance of complex functional constructs - sometimes, much harder. Writing efficient functional code seems to require some background knowledge, and also some knowledge in which places it's not that good an idea to use that approach.\n* (Mentioned in /r/cpp :) Some people experience it as more difficult to debug functional code, especially because it is harder to use a debugger. They also seem to experience that code aggregates itself in more and more complex chunks which are hard to examine and understand separately. What I observe is that developers using dynamic functional languages tend to use more unit tests and a REPL - similar to Python.\n* The opinions on a performance disadvantage in functional code vary very widely and depend likely on several crucial things. This could be due to unclear documentation, wrong expectations, or exaggerated praise on what functional languages can do well. Some people report performance disadvantages of up to a factor of 1000, but it might be that the corresponding code does not match best practices and recommendations around performance (e.g. they are using immutable data structures in local functions which are updated in hot loops, when performance recommendations strongly suggest to use mutable arrays; or they use parallelization and multiple threads to execute small tasks in parallel when the documentation says only sizable tasks should be parallelized that way). In other words, in some functional languages there exist recommendations *against* using such approaches in specific scenarios, and these recommendations should probably be observed.\n",

But, ones and zeroes are not *real*, you can't touch a one or a zero, correct me if I'm wrong but they just represent something, and that something (again, correct me if I'm wrong) is just low and high voltages of electricity. \n\nCan anyone confirm for me that the way I think about a computer is actually correct, and most importantly if that is correct, is it helpful to think that all a computer does is **literally** manipulate high and low voltages of electricity. Nothing more. \n\nThanks for reading and I appreciate any comments you might have. ",
