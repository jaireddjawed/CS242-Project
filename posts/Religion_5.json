        "text": " Almost all moral views Jesus thought were not new at all, and he used to quote the Torah to justify his points. Jesus also was not usually debated by Pharisees on terms of his moral views, but on his theology.\n\nHowever, on forgiveness, it seems Jesus did not base his ideas on Judaism. Sure, Jewish people encouraged forgiveness for each other, but they don't explicitly believe in forgiving their enemies as far as I know. In fact, it seems the Hebrew Bible sometimes celebrates revenge and expresses resentment, which I understand because having your people enslaved or killed is probably not something most people can forgive.\n\nPersonally, I think Jesus meant by \"enemies\" the people that we dislike in the everyday, the people we interact with face to face. Most of enemies we have are just people we dislike or dislike us for pity reasons, such as people that never say \"hi\" to us or who made us have an inconvenience. For example, forgiving Karen manager for treating you as trash 10 years ago in your first job, is probably more constructive than just keep living with that resentment for another 10 years, and also forgiving don't mean you approve or will be friend of that person.\n\nRegardless, the main issue I see that most Christians have with forgiving enemies is this question: Where is the limit? It seems Jesus did not encourage forgiving, for example, people who hurt children (Luke 17:2) but there are a lot between hurting children and just being mad at someone who took your parking.",

        "text": "First off , I’m a skeptic , religion, ghosts, ect… I have to see it , feel it to believe it. My dad died October of 2021. After taking care of him for 12 years through cancer remission and being terminal it was rough. The first week after was needless to say… interesting. I had nonstop dreams, extremely vivid. To the point I drew them. Some were him of course but others were a little more disturbing. Like me ending myself, torture/killing ect… I’ve never read the Bible, never read into the occult or anything like that. Family wasn’t religious at all. The one dream in particular. I was standing by my back door letting one of my dads old friends out and as I shut it , I looked to my left to see complete darkness and a six legged figure with a old man’s head screaming the most awful sound and running at me. I grabbed it with both my hands and smashed it’s head several times face first into the wall. As I held its head I looked at it, kinda looked like an old man. the face was pale gray ,eyes were bleach white. A stream of black blood fell from its nose. It looked at me and said “ I know you, you cheated death.” (I had a cardiac arrest when I was a kid from a heart condition I was born with but survived) It told me its name. Baal. Needless to say I was a little shook waking up. Again not religious. The series of events following have only got more intense. First I started to lose my hair, the house unexplainably got infested with 4 different types of bugs, I got diagnosed with arthritis (at 29) things began and still do fall around me, at work and at home around others as well, (I have it on camera). I’m unable to sleep in my room. A few years ago I had bought a keychain from a headshop of sorts, it is the devil tarot. I had it hanging on a lamp. One day I seen it moving like swinging back and forth. Also would move to face me no matter where I stood. First I recorded it , put a rosary over it. Immediately my guitar flew across the room. I got scared again and took it off. Could anyone tell me what that was all about?",

Schools teach religion, but it's mostly lore and theological views..",

There is also some specific denominational flair in there. I just want to know your thoughts\n\n[The Gospel of Jesus Christ Pamphlet ](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/the-gospel?lang=eng)\n\n____\n\nIf you are interested in a “deeper dive” I’ll copy and paste what the missionary handbook says.\n\n“The Divine Mission of Jesus Christ\n\nGod sent His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, into the world so that all of God’s children would have the possibility of experiencing joy and peace in this world and everlasting life in the world to come with their families. Additionally, through Jesus Christ all God’s children will live again when their bodies and spirits are reunited in the Resurrection (see Doctrine and Covenants 76:40–42).\n\nAs the result of Adam and Eve’s transgression, death is experienced by all people. And because all people have made mistakes and sinned, they are unable to return to live with God because “no unclean thing can dwell” in His presence (1 Nephi 10:21).\n\nHowever, through the Savior’s grace and mercy we will live again as resurrected beings and can be clean from sin so that we can live in our Heavenly Father’s presence. Becoming clean from sin is being healed spiritually (see 3 Nephi 9:13; 18:32).\n\nBecause of the Savior’s sacrifice, known as the Atonement of Christ, all people will be brought back into the presence of the Lord to be judged according to their works and their desires (see 2 Nephi 9:10–16; Helaman 14:15–18; 3 Nephi 27:14–22; Doctrine and Covenants 137:9) and will be raised from the dead. We will be judged according to the laws of justice and mercy.\n\nJustice is the unchanging law that brings consequences for actions—blessings for obedience to God’s commandments and penalties for disobedience. We all commit sin. Sin makes us unclean, and no unclean thing can live in God’s presence (see 1 Nephi 10:21; 3 Nephi 27:19; Moses 6:57).\n\nThe Savior satisfied the demands of justice for those who repent of their sins and endeavor to keep all of His commandments when He stood in our place and suffered the penalty for our sins. This act is called the Atonement of Jesus Christ. \n\nBecause of this selfless act, Christ can plead with the Father on our behalf. Heavenly Father can apply mercy, withhold punishment from us, and welcome us into His presence. Our Heavenly Father shows mercy when He forgives us of our sins and helps us return to dwell in His presence.\nHowever, Jesus did not eliminate our personal responsibility. He forgives our sins when we accept Him, repent, and obey His commandments. \n\nThrough Jesus Christ’s Atonement and living the gospel we can enter the presence of our Heavenly Father permanently. We show that we accept Christ and that we have faith in Him by doing His will and keeping His commandments, including obeying the first principles and ordinances of the gospel. Nephi refers to these principles and ordinances as “the doctrine of Christ” (2 Nephi 31:2–32:6).\n\n.\n\nFaith in the Lord Jesus Christ\n\nThe gospel of Jesus Christ begins with faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Having faith in Christ includes having a firm belief that He is the Only Begotten Son of God and the Savior and Redeemer of the world. It is to believe there is no “salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved” (Acts 4:12). There are other things that we need to believe if we are to have faith in Christ (see 3 Nephi 27:13–15).\n\nWe recognize that we can return to live with our Heavenly Father only by relying on His Son’s grace and mercy. When we have faith in Christ, we accept and apply His Atonement and His teachings. We trust Him and what He says. We know that He has the power to keep His promises. \n\nWe can develop faith in Christ through humility and doing His will and keeping His commandments. Heavenly Father blesses those who have faith to listen to and obey His Son.\n\nFaith in Christ leads to action. It leads to sincere and lasting change. Having faith causes us to try as hard as we can to learn about and become more like our Savior with “unshaken faith in him, relying wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save” (2 Nephi 31:19). We want to learn His will and keep His commandments. Even though we will still make mistakes, we show our love for Him by striving through the power of Christ’s Atonement to keep His commandments and avoid sin.\n\nWe believe in Christ, and we believe that He wants us to keep all His commandments. We show our faith by obeying Him. We pray in faith for strength to conquer temptation. As we live a specific commandment, we learn the truthfulness of it by experience (see John 7:17). We also grow in faith by hearing and reading the word of God (see Romans 10:17; Helaman 15:7–8).\n\nAs we obey God, He blesses us. He gives us power to meet life’s challenges. He helps us change the desires of our hearts. Through our faith in Jesus Christ, He can heal us, both physically and spiritually.\n\n.\n\nRepentance\n\nRepentance through the Atonement of Jesus Christ is another important principle of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Our faith in Christ and our love for Him lead us to repent, or to change our thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors that are not in harmony with His will. Repentance includes forming a fresh view of God, ourselves, and the world. When we repent, we feel godly sorrow and return to Him with full purpose of heart. We stop doing things that are wrong and continue doing things that are right. \n\nBringing our lives in line with God’s will through repentance and faith on Jesus Christ is a central purpose of our lives. We can return to live with God the Father only through Christ’s grace and mercy, and we receive Christ’s mercy on the condition of repentance.\n\nTo repent, we recognize our sins and feel remorse, or godly sorrow. We confess our sins to God. We also confess very serious sins to God’s authorized Church leaders, who will support us as we truly repent. We ask God to forgive us. We do all we can to correct the problems our actions may have caused; this is called restitution. As we repent, our view of ourselves and the world changes. As we change, we recognize that we are children of God and that we need not continue making the same mistakes over and over. If we sincerely repent, we turn away from our sins and do them no more. We resist any desire to commit sin. Our desire to follow God grows stronger and deeper.\n\nSincere repentance brings several results. We feel God’s forgiveness and His peace in our lives. Our guilt and sorrow are swept away. We feel the influence of the Spirit in greater abundance. And when we pass from this life, we will be more prepared to live with our Heavenly Father and His Son.\n\nEven after we have accepted Christ and repented of our sins, we may fall short and sin again. We should continually try to correct these transgressions, remembering we “can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth” us (Philippians 4:13). In addition, we should continually improve—develop Christlike qualities, grow in knowledge, and serve more effectively. As we learn more about what the Savior wants for us, we will want to show our love by obeying Him. \n\nThus, as we repent daily, we will find that our lives will change and improve. Our hearts and our behavior will become more Christlike. We will come to feel great joy in repenting daily.\n\n.\n\nBaptism, our first covenant with God\n\nFaith in Jesus Christ and repentance prepare us for the ordinances of baptism and confirmation. An ordinance is a sacred ceremony or rite that shows that we have entered into a covenant with God.\n\nGod has always required His children to make covenants. A covenant is a binding and solemn agreement between God and His children. God promises to bless us, and we promise to obey Him. God sets the terms of gospel covenants, which we either accept or reject. Keeping covenants brings blessings in this life and exaltation in the life to come.\n\nCovenants place us under a strong obligation to honor our promises to God. We should desire to worthily receive the covenants that God offers us and then strive to keep them. Our covenants remind us to repent every day of our lives, relying upon Jesus Christ. By loving the Lord, keeping His commandments, and loving and serving others we receive and retain a remission of our sins through “him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood” (Revelation 1:5).\n\nCovenants are usually made by means of sacred ordinances, such as baptism. These ordinances are administered by priesthood authority in the name of Jesus Christ. Through the ordinance of baptism, for example, we covenant to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ, always remember Him, and keep His commandments. As we keep our part of the covenant, God promises the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost, a remission of our sins, and being born again.\n\nThrough sacred ordinances, such as baptism and confirmation, we learn about and experience God’s power (see Doctrine and Covenants 84:20). Jesus taught that we must be baptized by immersion for the remission, or forgiveness, of our sins. Baptism is an essential ordinance of salvation. No person can enter the kingdom of God without being baptized by the Lord’s authorized servant. Christ set the example for us by being baptized.\n\nBaptism by immersion is a symbol of the death, burial, and Resurrection of the Savior. In a similar way, it represents the end of our old life of sin and a commitment to live a new life as a disciple of Christ. The Savior taught that baptism is a rebirth. \n\nWhen we are baptized we begin the process of being born again and become spiritual sons and daughters of Christ (see Mosiah 5:7–8; Romans 8:14–17).\n\nWe must be baptized to become members of His kingdom on earth, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and to eventually enter the kingdom of heaven. This ordinance is a law of God and must be performed by His authority and in His name (see Matthew 28:19–20). A bishop or mission president must give a priesthood holder permission to perform a baptism or confirmation.\n\nLittle children do not need to be baptized and are redeemed through the mercy of Jesus Christ (see Moroni 8:4–24). They are not to be baptized until they reach the age of accountability, which is eight years of age (see Doctrine and Covenants 68:27).\n\nBefore baptism we show our willingness to enter a covenant to keep all the commandments for the rest of our lives. After baptism we show our faith by keeping our covenant. We also regularly renew the covenant we make when baptized by partaking of the sacrament. Partaking of the sacrament weekly is a commandment. It helps us remain worthy to have the Spirit with us always. It is a weekly reminder of our covenant. \n\nBy partaking of the sacrament worthily we promise always to remember His sacrifice, we renew our promises, and we receive anew the promise that the Spirit will always be with us.\n\n.\n\nThe Gift of the Holy Ghost\n\nJesus taught that we must be baptized of water and also of the Spirit. Baptism by water must be followed by baptism of fire and of the Spirit or it is incomplete (see 2 Nephi 31:13–14). Only when we receive baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost can we receive a remission of our sins and become completely spiritually reborn. We then begin a new spiritual life as disciples of Christ.\n\nThe Holy Ghost has a sanctifying, cleansing effect upon us. Through the gift and power of the Holy Ghost, we can receive and retain a remission of sins through continued faith in Christ, repentance, and following the will of God and obedience to His commandments.\n\nThose who receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and remain worthy can enjoy His companionship throughout their lives. The Holy Ghost testifies of Christ and helps us recognize the truth. He provides spiritual strength and helps us do what is right. He comforts us during times of trial or sorrow. He warns us of spiritual or physical danger. \n\nThe Holy Ghost provides the power by which we teach and learn. The gift of the Holy Ghost is one of our Heavenly Father’s most precious gifts. Through the power of the Holy Ghost we can feel God’s love and direction for us. This gift is a foretaste of eternal joy and a promise of eternal life and exaltation.\n\n.\n\nEnduring to the End\n\nThe gospel of Jesus Christ includes obtaining and increasing our faith in Jesus Christ, repenting of our sins through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, being baptized by immersion by an authorized servant of the Lord in the name of Jesus Christ, receiving baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, and enduring to the end.\n\nEnduring to the end does not simply mean holding on until we die. Enduring to the end includes obtaining Christlike attributes through the Savior’s Atonement. Enduring to the end includes following the Father’s will and obeying His commandments, fasting, prayer, scripture study, observing the Sabbath day, repenting, and making and keeping sacred temple covenants.\n\nOnce we have been forgiven of our sins, we should try every day to remain free from sin so that we can always have the Holy Ghost with us. In the covenant of baptism, we promise our Father in Heaven that we will obey His commandments for the rest of our lives. If we fall short, we must repent in order to retain the blessings of the covenant. We promise to do good works, serve others, and follow the Savior’s example. In the scriptures this lifelong commitment is often called “enduring to the end.”\n\nBy following the gospel path, we can draw closer to God, conquer temptation and sin, and enjoy the gift of the Holy Ghost more abundantly. As we patiently, faithfully, and consistently follow this path throughout our lives, we will qualify for exaltation.\n\nFaith in Christ; repentance; making, renewing, and keeping covenants; and being cleansed by the Spirit become a pattern of living. Our actions in daily life are shaped and governed by these principles. Peace and joy come by following this way, and we gradually grow in Christlike attributes. Eventually, as we follow this way and “press forward with a steadfastness in Christ … and endure to the end,” we are promised, “Ye shall have eternal life” and exaltation (2 Nephi 31:20; see also Doctrine and Covenants 132:17).”\n\nExcess cut out or trimmed off.",

The basic idea being that religion as an idea is perfect, however in practice it can cause acts we would never think of. Having religion as one of if not the only thing we believe in without proof, some people inherit the ideas of \"words of god\", and this can be extremely dangerous. If not only for the fact of using religion as an excuse for evil.   \nExamples being The Crusades (war stemmed from religion), or the KKK's \"religious calling\"  \n\n\nI came to here because I was wanting to get feedback on my prompt and especially could really use some ideas for sources and material I could use to research it.   \n\n\nAnything helps!

        "text": "For some time now I have been Agmostic, although not by choice, but simply because my search for a faith that I can believe has thus far been unsuccessful, always there is a nagging, skeptical voice in the back of my head, always pointing out the flaws and failings of whatever system I happen to be researching.\n\nBut recently I have found myself more and more intrigued with the thought that the Sun may be divine, after all it's been worshiped in some form or facet by virtually every culture and religion in human history, and it even makes a degree of sense from a scientific perspective, our solar system -and by extension, us- exists because of it's birth, we quite literally revolve around it, life could not exist without it but at once it has the power to harm and end life as well, it speaks in the sense that it constantly roars, so loud that if space carried sound it would sound like being stood next to a jet engine here on earth, and it can affect us in an active fashion via solar storms and winds.\n\nAll this had been in the back of my head for a few days, but it really came to a head when yesterday a solar storm made the aurora extremely visible over my home, not only was it perhaps the single most beautiful thing I've ever seen, but it's also made me realize that the Sun's presence exist swell past the day time, the shine if the moon and the aurora are both manifestations of the Sun's light, a kind of omnipresence even when it cannot be seen.\n\nI find myself particularly intrigued by the roman cognomen *Sol Invictus*, the unconquered sun, because indeed unlike other celestial bodies the sun seems to be unconquerable, humans cannot land on it, we cannot colonize it, and while we may harness it's energy in the form of solar panels is that not just another form of the Sun’s benevolence? The only things that make me question this is what nuclear power -the suns own power in miniature- and the theoretical creation of a Dyson sphere could mean.\n\nI'm not exactly sure what I'm getting at with all tthis, I'm no theologian after all, but I'm curious as to what y'all think of this idea? Do they make any kind of sense? Am I onto something here? Are their any obvious failings or holes in this I haven't thought of? I would very much like some feedback.",

'You chose your suffering' 'You chose your abusers' 'You chose your accidents' 'TO LEARN FUCKING LIFE LESSONS'\n\n'I'm god' is also absurd concept to implement this victim blaming thing. It's not about empowering, it's about blaming you. 'Why aren't you godly enough or powerful enough to escape the suffering and unfairness?' While you enjoy your cozy psychedelic trip everything would feel fine, until you come back to sober 3rd dimension and go back to your human life. You pay rent, go to work, do chores, fight your coworkers, fight your boss, encounter a criminal in the street, get robbed, then cry after calling police. If you're a god, why did you ALLOW all this? Of course everything is your fault. Or you chose life experience to be robbed because your godly Source was bored of happiness and peace. You either chose to be robbed or allowed it. That's what this 'I'm god' thing is all about.\n\nIf being robbed is ok with you, then tell me why earthquake happened to Turkey people?\n\nBack to my point. Every fluffy comforting spiritual/religious teachings are eventually all about blaming you for living in this Matrix. 'EVERYTHING IS YOUR FAULT' or 'YOU CHOSE IT'.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/11d72p3/biblical_and_quranicislamic_parallels_on_social/",
        "text": "I started a thing where I was looking at Biblical and Quranic parallels when it came to ethics. The first part dealt with social justice, particularly for widows and orphans. For this one I'm going now be focusing on just war ethics. I'm writing these things as a Christian myself but nevertheless noting important parallels that people from all of the Abrahamic traditions can learn from. For this one I'm also going to be including Hadith sources given the fact that they tend to a bit more specific in fleshing out what the Quran is speaking of on these topics. An important parallel that can be seen is the notion of overstepping \"limits\". So here goes.\n\n**Biblical:**\n\n* \"Then the slaughtered every male there, including Hamor and his son Shechem. They killed them with their swords, then took Dinah from Shechem's house and returned to their camp. Meanwhile the rest of Jacob's sons arrived. Finding the men slaughtered, they plundered the town because their sister had been defiled there. They seized all the flocks and herds and donkeys-everything they could lay their hands on, both inside the town and outside the fields. They looted all their wealth and plundered their houses. They also took their little children and wives and led them away as captives. Afterward Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, 'You have ruined me! You made me ***stink*** among the people of this land-among all the Canaanites and Perizzites\"(Genesis 34:25-30)\n* \"When you are attacking a town and the war drags on, you must not cut down the trees with your axes. You may eat the fruit, but do not cut down the trees. Are the trees your enemies, that you should attack them? You may only cut down trees that you know are not valuable for food. Use them to make the equipment you need to attack the enemy town until it falls\"(Deuteronomy 20:19-20)\n* \"As the Aramean army advanced toward, Elisha prayed 'O Lord, please make them blind;. So the Lord struck them with blindness as Elisha had asked. Then Elisha went out and told them ;You have come the wrong way! This isn't the right city! Follow me, and I you to the man you are looking for'. And he led them to the city of Samaria. As soon as they had entered Samaria, Elisha prayed 'O Lord, now open their eyes and let them see'. So the Lord opened their eyes, and they discovered that they were in the middle of Samaria. When the king of Israel saw them, he shouted to Elisha 'My father, should I kill them? Should I kill them?' '***Of course not***'! Elisha replied. '***Do we kill prisoners of war? Give them food and drink and send them home again to their master***'. So the king made a great feast for them and then sent them home to their master\"(2 Kings 6:18-23)\n* \"The armies of Israel captured 200,000 women and children from Judah and seized tremendous amounts of plunder, which they took back to Samaria. But a prophet of the Lord named Oded was there in Samaria when the army of Israel returned home. He went out to meet them and said 'The Lord, the God of your ancestors, was angry with Judah and let you defeat them. ***But you have gone too far, killing them without mercy, and all heaven is disturbed***. And now, you are planning to make slaves of these people from Judah and Jerusalem. What about your own sins against the Lord your God? Listen to me and return these prisoners you have taken, for they are your own relatives. Watch out, because now the Lord's fierce anger has been turned against you!'...***So the warriors released the prisoners and handed over the plunder in the sight of the leaders and all the people. Then the four men just mentioned by name came forward and distributed clothes from the plunder to the prisoners who were naked. They provided clothing and sandals to wear, gave them enough food and drink, and dressed their wounds with olive oil***. They put those who were weak on donkeys and took all the prisoners back to their own people in Jericho\"(2 Chronicles 28:8-11/14-15)\n* \"This is what the Lord says: \"The people of Tyre have sinned again and again, and I will not let them go unpunished. They broke their treat of brotherhood with Israel, selling whole villages as slaves to Edom\"(Amos 1:9)\n* \"This is what the Lord says: 'The people of Ammon have sinned again and again, and I will not let them go unpunished. When they attacked Gilead to extend their borders, they ripped open pregnant women with their swords\"(Amos 1:13)\n\n**Quranic/Islamic:**\n\n* \"And fight in the way of God against those who fight against you, but do not ***transgress***. Truly God ***loves not the transgressors***. And slay them wheresoever you come upon them, and expel them whence they expelled you, for strife is worst than slaying. But do not fight with them near the Sacred Mosque until they fight with you there. But if they fight you, then slay them. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers. But if they desist, then there is no enmity save against the wrongdoer\"(Surah Al Baqarah, 2:190-193)\n* \"A repudiation from God and his messenger to those idolaters with whom you made a ***treaty***. So travel freely throughout the land for four months, and know that you cannot thwart God, and that God shall disgrace the disbelievers. And an announcement from God and his messenger to the people on the greater Hajj: that God and his messenger have repudiated idolaters. So if you repent, if would be better for you. And if you turn away, then know that you cannot thwart God. And give the disbelievers glad tidings of a painful punishment, save for those idolaters ***with whom you have made a treaty, and who thereafter commit no breach against you***, nor support anyone against you. ***So fulfill the treaty with them for its duration. Truly God loves the reverent***. Then, when the sacred months have passed, slay the idolaters wheresoever you find them, capture them, besiege them, and lie in wait for them at every place of ambush. ***But if they repent, and perform prayer and give alms, then let them go their way. Truly God is forgiving and merciful. And if any of the idolaters seek asylum with thee, grant him asylum until he hears the Word of God***\"(Sura Al Tawbah, 9:1-6)\n* \"When you meet those disbelieve(in war), strike at their necks; then when you have overwhelmed them, tighten the bonds. Then, free them graciously or hold them for ransom till war lay's down its burden\"(Surah Muhammad, 47:4)\n* \"For this reason, we prescribed for the children of Israel that whosoever slays a soul-unless it be for another soul or working corruption upon the earth-it is as though he slew mankind altogether, and whosoever saves the life of one; it is as though he saved the life of mankind altogether.\"(Surah Al Ma'idah, 5:32)\n* \"Do not commit treachery or deviate from the right path. You must not mutilate dead bodies. Neither kill a child, nor a woman, nor an aged man. Bring no harm to the trees, nor burn them with fire, especially those which are fruitful. Slay not any of the enemy's flock, save for your food. You are likely to pass by people who have devoted their lives to monastic services; leave them alone\"\\_Abu Bakr Al Siddiq(Al Muwatta 918)\n* \"Ibn Abbas wrote to him: 'You have written asking me whether the Messenger of Allah(may peace be upon him) took women with him to participate in Jihad. He did take them to battle and sometimes he fought along with them. ***They would treat the wounded*** and were given reward from the booty, but he did not assign any regular share for them. And the Messenger of Allah(may peace be upon him) ***did not kill children of the enemy, so though shouldst not kill the children***\"(Sahih Muslim, Book of Jihad, prg 4456)\n\nBoth the Biblical and Quranic injunctions showed a humanitarian concern in wartime context that would in turn bring an ethical change in terms of how humanity viewed the concept of a \"just war\" in terms of humanitarianism for non combatants. And we see this in the traditions of the three Abrahamic faiths:\n\n**Jewish:**  \"On besieging a city in order to seize it, we must not surround it on all four sides but only on three sides, thus leaving a path of escape for whomever wishes to flee to save his life.\"\\_Maimonides(Mishneh Torah, Book of Judges)\n\n\"War is not waged against anyone in the world unless peace is first offered; neither in a voluntary war nor in an obligatory one... and it is forbidden to violate the covenant and to cheat them once they have surrendered peacefully and accepted the seven Noahide laws.\"\\_Maimonides(Mishneh Torah, Melakhim 6:1)\n\n**Christian:**  \"Is it reasonable, is it sensible to boast of the extent and grandeur of empire, when you cannot show that men lived in happiness, as they passed their lives amid the horrors of war, amid the horrors of the shedding of men's blood-whether the blood of enemies or fellow citizens-under the shadow of fear and amid the terror of ruthless ambition?\"\\_St Augustine(City of God, Book 4, prg 4) \n\n\"Now, to attack one's neighbours, to pass on to crush and subdue more remote peoples without provocation and solely from the thirst of dominion-what is one to call this but brigandage on the grand scale?\"\\_St Augustine(City of God, Book 4, prg 6) \n\n**Islamic:**  \"I asked: Do you think that the blind, the crippled, the helpless insane, if taken prisoners of war or captured in a surprise attack would be killed. He replied: No, they should not be killed\"\\_Muhammad Al-Shaybani(The Islamic Law of the Nations, chp 2) \n\n\"The prophet said: 'Do not kill children\\[walid\\]. In the Arabic language the word walid means one who is born\\[mawlud\\] and every human being\\[adami\\] is born. However customarily this word is only used for young children. Therefore it is a proof that it is impermissible to kill young children among them\\[the non-Muslim\\] as long as they are not fighting. It is mentioned in a hadith that the prophet forbade the killing of women and children and said 'Kill the warring elders of the pagans\\[during the state of war\\] and keep alive their subordinates. What is meant by 'elders' are the adults amongst them and what is meant by 'subordinates' are their followers among the young and womenfolk....And it is mentioned in Abu Bakr's dictated command to Yazid Abi Sufyan: 'Kill neither a feeble old man nor a fragile young child; in other words an elderly man and young child do not fight\"\\_Imam Al Sarakhsi(Al Mabsut 10:5-6) \n\nSo all 3 Abrahamic faiths have a concern for justice in wartime conditions that is motivated by a humanitarian impulse that traces its origins in both the Biblical and Quranic corpus. Because of this we see important parallels in these traditions when it comes to wartime humanitarianism.",

Well, Jesus was born in Bethlehem, right? So the person  or people who wrote the gospels allegedly tried to fit Jesus into this  prophecy by writing that Jesus moved to Nazareth after His birth in  Bethlehem.\n\nWell, how do some Christians feel about that theory?",

A security blanket if you will. Take the ancients for example…they believed our weather system was angry gods upset they didn’t get a sacrifice or something. Nope, it was just basic science. Natural weather for the planet. All debunked. I honestly hate the fact they made a religious branch for science essentially.\n\nI personally feel religion is for the weak minded(all due respect). It’s used as a crutch by people who hope to get a bunch of riches from a deity(just to be constantly let down), or by people who just fear the unknown of what happens when we die. What better way to ease that worry, than to be a “good (insert religious name here) boy” and go to a nice pearly white paradise with blue water and perfect people in it?\n\nI think they were all created to combat the fear of the unknown. Science and math solve a lot of questions we have as humans. Religion isn’t totally necessary, but I wonder how the world would be if everyone dropped their religion tomorrow? Thoughts?",
