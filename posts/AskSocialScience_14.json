        "text": "I’m reading [The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0812974441/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_QfL3Ab8XQ0WS7) by Phil Zimbardo, of the famous Stanford Prison Experiment. The premise of the book is this: \n\n&gt;\tA full understanding of the dynamics of human behavior requires that we recognize the extent and limits of personal power, situational power, and systemic power. \n\nAnd: \n&gt;\tMost of us have a tendency both to overestimate the importance of dispositional qualities and to underestimate the importance of situational qualities when trying to understand the causes of other people’s behavior.\n\nI’m about halfway through the book. I’m a total layman, so I’m struggling a bit to differentiate the types of power. \n\nZimbardo explains the terms *dispositional* and *situational &amp; systemic* by comparing the views of modern psychiatry and clinical psychology (dispositional) and social psychology (systemic &amp; situational). According to him, the former asks “Who?” while the latter asks “What?” \n\nThat’s clear enough—I get the gist. I understand that the dispositional approach focuses on inherent personal qualities, while the situational and systemic approaches focus on external factors. \n\nThe problem is, he hasn’t really clarified the differences between types of power. Sometimes it’s obvious—institutions like prisons, militaries, companies/employers, hospitals, etc. hold systemic power. But situational and personal power blur together in my mind quite a bit. \n\nCan anyone give me a sort of working definition of the three, and maybe some examples? For instance, in the Stanford Prison Experiment the systemic power seems pretty clear; that would be the authority vested in the guards by their role in the prison hierarchy. The power of the uniform. But what are some examples of situational and personal power within the experiment? \n\nOr even better, what would be some examples of systemic, situational, and dispositional/personal power in a setting that isn’t obviously institutional—like an abusive husband/wife or parent/child relationship?

One test done on self identified liberals and conservatives was very telling. So liberals and conservatives were asked to pose an argument as if they were on the other side. So liberals as if they were conservatives and conservatives as though they were liberal.\n\nIt was determined that liberals could, almost alway, not pose their arguments as conservatives without exaggerating, or being hysterical. They were therefore unable to pose an opponents position.\n\nConservatives on the other hand were able to make arguments as a liberal, almost always, very well.\n\nIt was telling that one side didn’t or couldn’t understand the other side, while the other understood the other side but disagreed with it.\n\nSo i take it the thought here is that it does have more to do with the approach, rather than some predisposition to emotions vs logic.\n\nIn the same book, Jonathan Haidt argues that conservatives tend to be more in tune with their negative side than liberals.\n\nIn one study, conservatives and liberals were asked to look at a poster board that had multiple images on it. A variety of things like kids smiling and puppies, also open wounds and blood.\n\nThe self identified liberals focused longer on the positive images, while the conservatives looked and were more interested in the negative. I wonder how this might apply to the effects of understanding the opposite opinion?\n\n",

The country’s language — a mix of three syllabaries, with thousands of complex “kanji” ideograms — bedeviled early-age word-processing software. Until the early 1990s, Japanese was nearly impossible to type. Even today, particularly for older Japanese people, it’s easier to write a letter by hand than with a standard keyboard. Japan also relies on seals, called “hanko,” that are required for most official documents.\n\n&gt;While the typing difficulties also apply to China, the country never got stuck in the fax stage, tech experts say. \n\nWhy did China overcome this and not Japan?",

        "text": "Hey Forgive me if I'm asking this question the wrong place, but I was a bit puzzled by something I read in a forum. Supposedly someone is trying to show that surplus value can be made without exploiting the workers. I kinda gather that his point rests on the value of the workers' labour being determined by the cost of subsistence, or rather the exchange value of the necessities the worker must procure to live. He writes this:\n\nIf there were no capitalist wage, the production should determine the value for Marx, not the contrary:\n\n\"Now suppose that the average amount of the daily necessaries of a labouring man require six hours of average labour for their production. Suppose, moreover, six hours of average labour to be also realized in a quantity of gold equal to 3s. Then 3s. would be the price, or the monetary expression of the daily value of that man's labouring power. If he worked daily six hours he would daily produce a value sufficient to buy the average amount of his daily necessaries, or to maintain himself as a labouring man.\"\n\nThe worker is a waged worker in a capitalist world, but if capitalism was fair, it would be like this:\n\n\"But our man is a wages labourer. He must, therefore, sell his labouring power to a capitalist. If he sells it at 3s. daily, or 18s. weekly, he sells it at its value. Suppose him to be a spinner. If he works six hours daily he will add to the cotton a value of 3s. daily. This value, daily added by him, would be an exact equivalent for the wages, or the price of his labouring power, received daily. But in that case no surplus value or surplus produce whatever would go to the capitalist. Here, then, we come to the rub.\"\n\nBut capitalism is not fair, so:\n\n\"In buying the labouring power of the workman, and paying its value, the capitalist, like every other purchaser, has acquired the right to consume or use the commodity bought. You consume or use the labouring power of a man by making him work, as you consume or use a machine by making it run. By buying the daily or weekly value of the labouring power of the workman, the capitalist has, therefore, acquired the right to use or make that labouring power during the whole day or week.\"\n\nA very important point (please, pay attention to how Marx says the value of labour is determined again):\n\n\" The value of the labouring power is determined by the quantity of labour necessary to maintain or reproduce it\" (no market's fluctuation accounted for! only the production)\n\nSo, now, how surplus value is created?\n\n\"We have seen that, to daily reproduce his labouring power, he must daily reproduce a value of three shillings, which he will do by working six hours daily. But this does not disable him from working ten or twelve or more hours a day. But by paying the daily or weekly value of the spinner's labouring power the capitalist has acquired the right of using that labouring power during the whole day or week. He will, therefore, make him work say, daily, twelve hours. Over and above the six hours required to replace his wages, or the value of his labouring power, he will, therefore, have to work six other hours, which I shall call hours of surplus labour, which surplus labour will realize itself in a surplus value and a surplus produce.\"\n\nSo, to my point, Marx never consider the market price fluctuations to calculate the value of labour nor to determine the surplus value, but it is all calculated on the production side (That is not even a new criticism on Marx!). So you cannot put the market fluctuations - which ultimately determines the profit - back on the equation because there is no place for it there, and actually, as i showed above, for Marx, it should be quite the opposite.\n\nYou can say that it makes no sense because if 'my' interpretation is correct, Marx would be ignoring completely the market fluctuations on determining prices, wages and - ultimately - profit, but, that is precisely the point, and one of the main reasons his theory is wrong.\n\nYour interpretation is that, for Marx, the fair wage can be determined by the market fluctuation so the surplus value and the fair amount of work will change accordingly to the market (even if the overall conditions of production of society remains the same!). I really never saw any marx's writtings that supports that, nor saw any marxist's philosopher saying that (i work on philosophy and i talk a lot with marxists phiosophers). And again, im not reinventing the wheel here, thats a common interpretation on marx and a common criticism. [end]\n\nI don't really know what to say here. My understanding of the LTV is a bit crude, I must admit, but basically says that the worker starts generating surplus value, after he has produced enough to pay for his own wage as well as the other costs of production the capitalist incurs. Surplus value is therefore value generated by the worker, that he does not receive. In case of price fluctuations in the market, I would assume according to the LTV that the point where surplus value began, would just be after fewer hours, than if the market price of the commodity is relatively lower.\n\nAnyway, I hope some bright minds can shed some light on this.",

From what I understand, positivism is an approach to social science where the scientist believes that they can be totally objective in how they measure human behavior and that everything is knowable through empirical research and that anything that can’t be observed/quantified is not scientific. Post-positivism is an approach to social science where qualitative methodologies are acceptable because studying human behavior is not the same as studying physics or biology, even though you can approach both topics “scientifically”. Interpretivism is kind of hard for me to understand but I guess that it says that both of the previous approaches are kind of lame (but I don’t really understand what they propose to do instead)\n\nI can see that they’re all kind of similar, in the sense that they all want to understand human behavior but why are they so different that they deserve different definitions? They all have to use the same techniques to understand stuff and those techniques can’t be the same as the ones in natural science.\n\nI know that none of these approaches are ”wrong”. Interpretivism seems kind of cloudy to me but my teacher called herself an interpretivist but she’s also a big statistics person too. Maybe I’m just a fence-sitter, but post-positivism seems the way to go. I hear that true positivists aren’t really around anymore because studying human behavior is different than studying natural phenomenon or whatever. But interpretivism doesn’t really sit right with me. I guess it’s good to take your own biases and perception into account while you’re trying to understand some kind of social thing but if you can’t quantify it, who are you ever going to be able to convince? I’m aware of the critiques of Big Data and how, like, it can’t be used to predict everything (or anything really) To use a sports analogy (a topic I’m much more comfortable with), statistics can tell us how good a team was but it can’t tell us how good a team will be. I’m doubtful that any social science can really predict anything about people outside of general stuff but that all of the approaches can understand how things were. Please help me understand!\n",

        "text": "(\"the Western world\" generally defined [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world))\n\nThe argument goes like this ([from KubrickIsMyCopilot](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/8ahoyw/eli5_why_is_japan_still_reyling_on_so_much/dwyp760/)):\n\n&gt;Japan got its reputation for being technologically advanced from the post-WW2 period when its economy surged forward and leapt ahead of the world in technology, and from the many ways that it uses technology in daily life that people of other countries don't bother with (e.g., in toilets).\n\n&gt;But Japan is generally very conservative in its approach to change. It leapt ahead in technology only temporarily when its economy was being rebuilt after the War, but after it built up and stabilized, it \"rested on its laurels\" and its rate of progress is much more modest today. Culturally, it sees no reason to abandon things that work.\n\n&gt;Very likely the same thing will happen to both Korea and China eventually, but they're still in the mode of pursuing rapid technological advancement because they started later than Japan. Korea started in the '80s, China more in the '90s.\n\n&gt;Technology as an insatiable hunger - as a pursuit in itself whose social disruptions are proof of its value (as in the culture of Silicon Valley) - is more of a Western thing, sometimes remarked on as pathological by critics. The current rapid advancement of China by contrast is just inertia, because it was starting from so far behind, and is being pushed by political forces. Once their economy reaches technological saturation, as Japan's did in the '90s, further disruptions will be seen as dangerous and increasingly discouraged in favor of incremental changes.\n\n___\n&gt;I wouldn't be able to unravel the countless articles over the course of decades. But here's one article that says basically the same things:\n\n&gt;http://www.bbc.com/news/business-34667380\n\nedit: I PM'd them asking for further clarification, this is what they replied:\n&gt;I would put it like this: The West has \"chaos in its heart\" as the Nietzsche quote goes, and revels at least in the constructive version of disruption. That's not \"exceptionalism,\" because it ultimately boils down to geography (I'll get to that).\n\n&gt;The West romanticizes the act of discovery and novel creation, because the very geography of Europe was an engine for spinning up the hunger for the new: The Aegean was like the tidepool in which its civilization was born, full of islands to explore, and every subsequent step in the evolution of Europe and its derivative civilizations has accelerated that initial condition.\n\n&gt;East Asia is different. China is incredibly fertile and wide. Its coast is long, but it has a low ratio of islands to mainland shore, so its history had more in common with ancient Egypt (i.e., the Nile) than with Europe's accelerating \"chainsaw\" of peninsulas. Ancient Egypt lurched forward and achieved things that are incredible even today, then just spent the next 2,000 years gilding the lilies they'd created rather than plowing further ahead.\n\n&gt;China is more dynamic than that. They have periods of advance, followed by periods of slow stability, and that's characteristic of East Asia in general because their geography didn't allow anything else. It was a crowded place from ancient times, so cultures are highly attuned to stability just by harsh natural selection. Innovations that served stability were prized, others were either ignored or suppressed as dangerous.\n\n&gt;The West is not homogeneous in this, but some aspects of it want to be supernovas - to burn bright and fast, and stab into the future with reckless abandon. Societies like China and Japan wish to advance holistically, as an entire society, so it happens in more considered, momentous, inertial terms - slow, then accelerating, then cruising, then slowing down again. Individualism is more staccato, if that makes any sense.\n\n&gt;East Asia is content to observe our madness and pick and choose what aspects make sense for them to develop further, and they do discover things independently - though as stated, most of the time they don't see them as useful to pursue because the idea might be disruptive.\n",

        "text": "I'm hoping that my question isn't trollbait. \n\nIt seems to me that a lot of qualitative research can easily suffer from problems such as selection bias or an insufficiently large sample. \n\nE.g. If I do a study of four schools and divide each school into a type, it seems perfectly plausible that my typology might be wrong since the set of schools I investigated might be biased. \n\nAscribing meaning to something is probably important, but how does one effectively generalize. An article in say the NYTimes might reflect one viewpoint, but even if one reads NYTimes, WashPo, and WSJ articles it is plausible that none are reflective of the general feelings of the population or even the political elite. Similarly, shouldn't one have some system to tell how similar some set of articles are outside of just reading them.\n\nIs qualitative research primarily there to make generalizations about small groups? E.g. To do an ethnography of a particularly tribe and record some of their practices, folkways, myths, etc. without necessarily making any broader generalizations?\n\nI'm not saying that qualitative research is useless nor that people who do it don't have good explanations, but I've always been confused by how it overcomes those difficulties. And also how it relates to quantitative research. \n\nHow do the two types of researches work together? Is it something like the qualitative research creating a theory or ideal type and then the quantitative researcher attempting to verify or disprove it? Do qual researchers gather data that quant researchers then attempt to generalize? Or am I missing something? \n\n(To be clear, I am assuming that I am missing something and that there are perfectly good answers to these questions.) ",

Another factor was  and the withdrawal of corporal punishment in schools. \n\nWhat does everyone think of this narrative, is there evidence to support or contradict it. ",

So that is why I mentioned the words 'inner savagery' as in, where military personnel may be trained to put aside their civilian self and be more in touch with their aggression, a side that is often associated with primal desires and behaviours\n\nWhat is inquisitive  to me is that people who are recruited in the military come from a civilian background and most of them are probably told to not kill or be aggressive in some way so their views and perspectives on aggression or even actually killing an enemy can be quite new, shocking and difficult to adapt to\n\nI know that not all military personnel eventually go through active duty or even kill an enemy when ordered to because there are military personnel different tasks. But all people who go through military recruitment training all go through an indoctrination phase where their whole civilian identities are deconstructed and later reconstructed to become military personnel (until they later so back to their civilian lives after recruitment training is over)\n\nSo I often wonder how these recruits (and military personnel in future training exercises) are told to exploit and harness their inner primal savagery and inner aggression or their inner tribalism/ingroup-outgroup bias and keep it in a controlled manner *while still* able to go back to their civilian background where the environment is completely different?\n\nWho are recruits/military personnel trained to neglect all of their humanity or their enemies' (whether they have a family or are scared or just drafted in the military against their will or the fact that they are as human as they are, or the complicated morality regarding killing and the economic-political complications associated with warfare) or trained to push it aside, regardless their background or their upbringing or their perspectives on aggression or even killing, and still able to go back to their daily lives whether it is in a military base or the civilian life?\n\n",
