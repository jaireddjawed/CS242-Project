        "text": "Every now and again /r/history has a history week where they link to a history subreddit. The second week of October was Irish history week on reddit. This involved several months ago contacting the /r/history mods. Asking them if we could be subreddit of the week and going off and organising some AMAs for that week.\n\nThis post is to help other history subreddits organising being subreddit of the week. \n\n**What /r/history did**\n\n/r/history added us to their header. The put a sticky up announcing /r/irishhistory week. They added the AMA schedule to the sidebar. \nThey also agreed that we could cross post the AMAs when they were on. \n\n/r/ireland also added this subreddit of the week as a sticky post and allowed us to cross post the AMA's\n\nAsk and we can give you the css for these sidebars and headers.\n\n**The AMAs**\n\nWe organised four AMA's.\nThe list of them is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IrishHistory/comments/2hw7le/irish_history_week_the_week_starting_october_5th/). \n\n**Lessons learned**\n\nSetting up an reddit account and posting an AMA including links is a lot to expect from a non reddit user. For a new user set up an account for them. Several days in advance. Reddits antispam setting mean new users had trouble logging in. \n\nThey also could not work out how to format links. Creating an account for them. Getting the text they want by email. Fixing the formatting for them. sending them the username password and url for the AMA might work. But that does risk the new users not being allowed to log in problem.\n\nAdd them to the approved submitters list for your subreddt\n\nCross post to any subreddit that you have asked in advance if you can. The cross post should say \"/r/yourhistorysubreddit is having an AMA on ...\"\nThen right a first comment of something like\n\n**THIS IS NOT THE AMA IT IS A LINK TO THE AMA**\n\nplease head over to /r/yourhistorysubreddit for a chat with them \n\nNot doing this lead to massive confusion on /r/history and several temper tantrums by commenters there.\n\nAcademic historians seem not to want to do an AMA. I tried several and the concept confused ans scared them.\nHistorians who have written books are more open to public engagement. Mercier press publishers organised for two of their authors to be involved in AMA's. So publishers seem a good source of AMAs.\n\nThe Gaelic mythology AMA on Wednesday was wildly popular. /u/Yerwun is a redditor so perhaps she had a more conversational/reddit tone. Ive sent here the graphs of pageviews from her AMA. If she decides to write a book on Irish mythology hopefully she can use them to help prove interest with publishers.\n\n\n**Statistics**\n\nPageviews peaked at 14000 during the Gaelic mythology AMA. This is from a usual average of 160 per day.\nIn August we had 5000 pageviews so far in October over 30000.\n\nSubscriptions - We got an extra 600 subscriptions this week or an increase of about 15% on the total size of our subreddit. The graphs are [here](http://imgur.com/a/NVkYW) if you are interested.\n\n\nThanks to the mods of /r/history (and /r/ireland) for allowing and for helping to run this. With their help I think /r/irishhistory week succeeded in increasing awareness of Irish history on reddit.",

Does a successful post have a certain type of quality that increases virility? \n\nBackground information: I am doing an undergraduate research project on memetic evolution, specifically how information is transferred from person to person on an online community. I am generally focusing on how memes are replicated, mutated and changed through sharing and reposting. I am hoping to gather information on reasons why certain posts have more viral success than others. I would really appreciate some discussion about how memes evolve online. I have already done extensive research on the theory behind memetic evolution, but it would be great to gather first hand opinions on this subject.\n\nSome questions of discussion: Do you find yourself upvoting certain types of posts over others? Do successful posts possess a quality that can influence virality? Why do you think certain memes are more successful than others? How do you think memes evolve through sharing and reposting? If you do repost content, do you change the original post in any way? When you post original content, do you consider its potential virality?\n\nI look forward to seeing what everyone has to say about this! Even if you are not very knowledgeable about the evolution of memes, it would be great to hear your opinion on what you think makes a successful post.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/2iwor0/why_would_anyone_want_their_subreddit_to_be_a/",
        "text": "TL;DR: Every time new defaults are added, users complain after a time about the worsening quality. Why would a team want their subreddit to become a default?\n\nReddit often has very different opinions and is proud of this fact. Unanimously, however, reddit users hate subreddits that became defaults. I've seen not a single subreddit where this complaint isn't brought up regularly. My simple question therefore is, as stated in the title, why would any moderator of any subreddit that they like would ever want that subreddit to become a default?\n\nAs far as I understand (Disclaimer: I'm not a core user in any subreddit I'm subscribed to and maybe I'm missing some community nuances) the \"old\" communities in used-to-be niche subreddits are swept away by the massive intake of new users (/r/books, /r/television are two popular examples) or the submissions become very stream-lined and similar (The typical /r/music circlejerk: \"What's your favorite album and why is it The Dark Side of the Moon?\") and so on, you know all the complaints.\n\nI have to agree with some, if not most, of them. I guess /r/technology wouldn't even have needed to implement the infamous auto-moderation if there weren't so many people trying to push their agenda. /r/science is more and more ridden with clickbait titles. I liked /r/movies for its discussions but even this (apparently) strictly moderated subreddit has more and more \"Media\"-tagged submissions on the frontpage.\n\nAs this can all be just confirmation, I'm putting it up for discussion, though I'm not interested in the discussion about a particular subreddit, I'm more interested in the thought-process of allowing a subreddit to be a default and with a simple gedankenexperiment, I only see the dilemma of either having a small subreddit with a core userbase or a flooded one:\n\nSay, I create /r/aweseome_subreddit (AS). I \"shamelessly plug\" it where it is appropriate and get some subscribers. There is discussion as desired, the amount of new posts is acceptable such that the community doesn't seem dead but it's still a manageable load for a small moderation team (1, 2 moderators, maybe) and people know each-other.\n\nI guess that's how successful subreddits start for the most part. If there's a small community, now either it diminishes over time (because no new users come) or it gains traction (I've never seen long-term subscriber plots for non-default subreddits, but I'm guessing subscriber numbers don't rise exponentially) and becomes bigger and bigger over time. Ideally, more and more qualified moderators are found. The core user base still forms the growing community since its values and comments are those with most impact.\n\nWhy would I want to change that by making the subreddit a default? I have two theories:\n1. Enlightment of the others: The moderators wish for outsiders, for new people on reddit, to join in on this experience. Everybody should know about /r/awesome_subreddit and get an overall better reddit experience.\n2. Great communities need great numbers: The sky's the limit! /r/slightly_less_awesome has X subscribers? I need to have X+1! The community runs itself, it has done so forever and will continue.\n3. Mortal fear: How long will the subreddit stay alive when it isn't up for being a default? A lot of people *might* be interested in this, but wouldn't *know* bout it without it being a default. People won't find the subreddit by word of mouth or the dreaded reddit search. I need this new influx.\n\nAre there more reasons to it I'm just not seeing with my admittedly overly pessimistic worldview? Any big fallacies? Please, tell me. I'm honestly curious about this because I just don't get why anyone would want the majority of reddit users post in their subreddit.\n\nI have of course picked certain defaults from above I see a lot of complaints about; personally, I don't know how or if /r/twoxchromosomes has changed. /r/askscience seens well moderated, as well.",

        "text": "A couple of days ago, some of you may have known about a post on [r/bestof](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/), the top thread was about a former Reddit employ who had recently lost his job and didn't know why. After reading about management abuse on another subreddit, the employ decided to do an AMA on how working at Reddit felt like.\n\nOnly 12 hours later, the CEO of the company rushes in and sweeps away the gold and up-votes simply by appealing to a contrary view. Now at first, the initial reaction would be to laugh since he had what was coming to him. Only that he didn't.\n\n\nYou see, I read through the replies made by the former employ, there was absolutely nothing bashing the company at all, no complaint, just a speculation as to why he was kicked out of the job. Other comments made by him included his bad times working there and how he felt that it was a life experience, nothing to attack him over for; but the lurkers couldn't disagree more.\n\n\nAfter re-reading the CEO's post, the reasons didn't seem sufficient enough to fire him over, when I mean sufficient, I mean that saying someone didn't do their work and made irrelevant comments during interviews is a reason you would fire someone that has worked for the company for only a short amount of time; contrary to that, the OP had been working for reddit for a while, so if the reasons were true, he would have been fired after working for a couple of weeks. \n\nRealize this, if I had a flatmate who had been living with me for months, and he had a pretty bad habit of not taking off his shoes at home, or barely cleaning up after eating, I could have gotten into a fight with him over a girl and kick him out of the flat. If anyone were to ask me why I kicked him out, as far as they're concerned, I could easily say that he had a bad habit of being messy and never cleaning up after himself even though that wasn't the reason for it. Even if there's a deeper story behind it, anyone listening to me can easily relate that a dirt flatmate should be kicked out and move on with their lives believing me.\n\nFor all we know, the employees probably didn't like the guy, or maybe he questioned authority. All I know is that the reasons didn't seem to add up, they felt thrown out there just for the sake of providing a reason.\n\nEventually, the former employees posts were down-voted to Oblivion, the CEO received 24 Gold, and the entirety of reddit just shifted it's opinion just as quickly when a contrary view is in place.\n\n\nWe really should watch out for these kinds of things because a CEO replying to a former employee doesn't make him a bastion of truth, but a simple counter view.\n\n**EDIT: Here are some links:***\n\n1.

With others, usually the popular gifs, it is harder to tell whether OP has or hasn't seen the image before, and many of the people who upvoted probably haven't seen it either.  Which do you think is more prevalent?",

I don't completely understand why the \"AMAA\" title format is used so widely as it doesn't really tell us anything we didn't already know.  In either scenario, the only questions that get answered are the ones they want to answer (or have time for).  It's also not as if having AMAA instead of AMA precludes Reddit's users from asking a particular question or even upvoting it (as we see in so many political AMAs with the top rated questions being unanswered and most certainly ones that the interviewee would rather not have been asked).\n\nIt's clearly a minor observation with little importance, but I've seen the \"well, keep in mind it's an AMAA and not AMA...\" more and more lately, as if that absolves dodging hugely popular questions in favor of low-hanging fruit.\n\nSo, if AMAA is actually a meaningful designation--what does it mean? How is it different from any other AMA? Are there unwritten (or implied) rules under an AMAA that I should be abiding by?  Should we, as a community, give passes to those unwilling to answer tough questions because they have designated AMAA rather than AMA?\n\n",

It has more than 100 points, and\n2. It has more than 50 comments, and\n3. It is older than one hour\".\n\nThe only downside is that mods might be accused of leaving up rule-breaking posts for reasons of favouritism, but it is my belief that mods will be clobbered by their communities less for being merciful with respect to deletions than for being hard-line with respect to deletions.\n\nThere is perhaps a problem with those submissions which get invaded and turn to manure, but there is a case to be made that these should we dealt with by comment removals and bannings, not wholesale removal of a thread.\n\nSubmissions which break the rules of reddit (e.g. doxxing, spam, CP or vote manipulation) should, of course, always be removed, but if these stay up for more than an hour in a popular subreddit, then that should be viewed as a reason to add more active moderators to the team.\n\n\n",

At the very least, votes still appear to be \"fuzzed\" (comment scores on archived posts vary when the page is refreshed). It's not clear how much fuzzing is going on, or more importantly how close this number is to reality (is 1000 pts approximately 1000 net upvotes? or could it be 100 net upvotes or 10,000 net upvotes?)\n\nAny other information related to the calculation of a post's karma is appreciated.

        "text": "For those of you who may recently have been living on top of a rock... here on Reddit [the CEO of this site made some waves yesterday by posting a comment and which harshly criticized a former employee when that employee foolishly chose to do an AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2iea97/i_am_a_former_reddit_employee_ama/cl1ygat) (as a former employee) and therein made some disparaging remarks about Reddit.  \n\nI'm wondering what /r/TheoryOfReddit subscribers think about all this.   \n\nMy primary concern was that it seemed like an excessive power play.  As if to demonstrate what someone in Yishan's position can do -- as opposed to, say, what most employers could do.  \n\nAnd, really, right or wrong, *IS THIS NOT A FORM OF DOXXING?!*  Is it not publicly using Reddit to reveal personal information about someone that otherwise would probably not be known?  And even if it's only *barely* doxxing, even if it's just a *little* bit doxxy, even if it's just a light gray area of doxxing... *it's doxxing being perpetrated by, arguably, the most powerful user on Reddit* -- so that undoubtedly amplifies the severity of the offense.  \n\nIt also potentially sets a negative precedent in terms of civility.  Yes, the former employee was being a top tier fool when he decided to do an AMA on his former employers' social media news site, but does that mean that it was appropriate for the CEO of the site to use the medium for the purposes of absolutely wrecking someone by revealing personal insider information?  At best it's a matter of tit-for-tat, which isn't necessarily very constructive but, at worst, it's a power play which could effectively work to stymie any criticism of Reddit and its owner or operators.  \n\nAt the same time, for better or worse, it shatters the illusion of Reddit admins being a relatively benign background influence.  Now we know that if you cross them... if you do something they don't like... they are willing to go after you with devastating efficiency.  And isn't that what everyone wants from their social media admins?!  I mean... imagine the potential consequences for FB if Mark Zuckerburg decided to post some devastating comments about a former employee and those comments got spread far and wide -- to the extent that other more traditional forms of media websites started commenting.  It would potentially be a PR disaster!  And I feel like that might be what this is.  The backlash for my hypothetical FB scenario, as well as the backlash for the actual scenario at hand, may not be particularly consequential.  But that may only be due to very subtle and arbitrary conditions which could easily have been different and which could change.  \n\nIMO... Yishan should delete his comment and apologize.  On the other hand, for legal reasons, he may not want to admit any guilt and therefore might standby his comment -- silently or publicly.  He could even double down more overtly.  I have not idea what he's inclined to do.  \n\nWhat do you all think about this situation?  ",

        "text": "EDIT: All statements made within this posts are simply my own observations. You may or may not agree with all points touched upon in this post.\n\nIn the past few months, reddit seems to have taken a turn to be more negative. I have a theory as to why, but it seems as though people like to downvote a lot more. People also seem to be a lot more confrontational and willing to put other people down. \n\nI think this may be the outcome of taking ups and downs away. Without a way to gauge how many people liked or disliked a comment it seems as though people will still hop on the bandwagon *no matter what direction the post's score is in.* So if someone sees a comment with -5 points, it seems as though people are more inclined to downvote it. Simply because that's what the general consensus *seems* to be. There could actually be 10 upvotes 15 downvotes and none would be the wiser. \n\nTaking away the number of ups and downs has also taken away context. When you take away context to a comment that has -5 points, it seems as though *nobody* likes the comment. Without this valuable context as to how many people vote up or down, the negative feeling you take away from a comment with a negative score overshadows the positive scores from your other comments. \n\nBefore the ups and downs were taken away, a lone upvote could acted as a vote of confidence in a sea of doubt. Now that we are unable to see ups and downs, we are forced into a pessimistic state of mind where we think nobody likes us, instead of at least someone liking us. \n\nI know this seems too little too late, but this is my takeaway from the change after dealing with it for a few months.\n\n**EDIT 2: Some people have brought up the point that I am making hypotheses beyond my initial hypothesis. Think of the further hypotheses as ways to test the initial hypothesis, as it has not yet been proven.**\n\n",

        "text": "Hello, Theory of Reddit. I've been a Redditor for three months, but considering how much I've ~~procrastinated on it~~ used it, and how much I've been observing how the community works, it feels like I've been here for a year.\n\nAnyway, to the point: I'm generally pretty good, karma-wise, but given that my social ineptness (I mentioned that I spend lots of time on Reddit, right?) creeps in to the internet, on occasion I say something that comes out the wrong way, or make a poor-quality joke, or whatever, and I get downvoted.\n\nNo worries, while I'd rather upvotes, I don't care about the numbers. I'm someone who genuinely wants to make the world a better place (sounds cheesy, but what else are we here for?), and thus I want to make a website that I frequent a better place. I can tell if my posts are improving the quality of the site by the karma score. So when one of my posts goes wrong (which is indicated by the downvotes), I often inquire why.\n\nAll that I do is ask why people are downvoting me. Apparently this is bad? \"No guys, I'm not complaining,\" I say. \"I'm wanting to know the mistakes I made so that I don't make them the next time.\" This just escalates it further.\n\nIsn't the main idea of voting so that there is incentive for good comments and disincentive for bad comments? Considering my difficulties with social skills (Asperger's Syndrome, for those curious), I don't always pick up on *why* a comment was good or bad, and I'm sure that other people are the same. Is there really anything wrong with asking why something was downvoted?\n\nFurthermore, is complaining about someone's downvote inquiries perfectly fine, another example of people acting \"tougher\" under the anonymity of Reddit, or is it blatantly contradicting the karma system itself?\n\n**TL;DR**: when I make a bad post/comment, which is indicated by downvotes, I inquire what went wrong. I get backlash for this, but doesn't this go against the very idea of downvoted; quality control? So that we can tell what we're doing wrong?\n\nWhat's your take on this, fellow mild-navel-gazers?",

With bitcoin today, it's becoming much easier to obtain wealth based off of more simpler forms of service. ie: Simple acts of kindness, entertaining comments, general help, or perception-changing ideas. We see it a lot with !bitcointip, and recently !changetip.\n\n Rewarding others with tips is in itself a rewarding and fun experience. The problem today is that it's not that easy to get in on the fun, since the process of transferring personal wealth into online currency is oh so difficult. But it will get easier. It's a huge market opportunity that is just waiting to be fleshed out. Energy abundance, automation, improved societal structures, cultural values, and a social virtual realities brought on by Facebook and Oculus Rift, will bring about a future where material things are going to depreciate in value, while the value of People, in respect to wealth-acquisition, is only going to soar.\n\n There may come a point where we're going to be providing the wealth for each other. In an age where we will have access to real time information of each other, we notice other people when they're in distress, whether it's through lack of rent, lack of food, or lack of entertainment. So in an empathetic future, we'll make sure that each of us get enough to live by so that we may all live comfortably, or more-so, if others believe we deserve it. \n\n So here comes my point. Say I don't have any friends, and I don't have any family. If I find myself homeless in the future for whatever reason, I can just show my reddit comment history to random passerbys, and show them what type of person I am. We all know that thanks to Reddits Karma system, we're actually providing value for each other. It's just that for now, the points don't matter. However, It will change.\n\n But alas. I've been a Reddit user for almost 3 years now, and I've recently scrolled back through my comment history to see my comments from years back... Only to find out they don't exist anymore. Luckily, I saved most of it on Microsoft word over the years since I've had this idea running through my mind for the longest time. But I strongly believe Reddit should change this. Comments should stay there forever. Our history is priceless. And storage space is only getting exponentially cheaper. Is there any way we could start to preserve our comment histories in case this dream of a future actually becomes reality? Even if it doesn't... I do believe that these comments have an intruinsic value within them, and will probably be explored by our descendants. I think it's safe to say that they'll appreciate our efforts to preserve our history. Especially during such a beautiful moment in our evolutionary history as a species.",

        "text": "Sorry if this subject isn't appreciated here, but I've always wonder why this is. For instance: \n\nToday there was a post on the front page saying that tuitions fees would be abducted in Germany. Some guy responded saying that students on his university only payed tuition during the time he took to get his degree, so that he had no luck.\n\nThen, there was a joke reply to this comment, saying that at least the OP could have pride in taking part in a social experiment in Germany. OFC there is a nazi connotation here, I found it amusing. But then someone reply saying that not all social experiments in Germany were to take pride of, and here the pun of the first joke is kinda ruined. But this comment, at the time I wonder about this, had way more upvotes than the parent, original joke, comment. At least 60% more.\n\nThis is the example that motivated me to ask for semi-scientific observations about this social phenomena (maybe outside reddit this happens too). I have seen more of this here on reddit where people tend to upvote the comments that explain the pun of a joke.\n\nHope this is ok to post here, and thank you for your time and attention.",

        "text": "#DISCLAIMER\n\nI'm very, very far from an expert on SCT. One of my classes discussed it, and reddit came to mind. I'm just going off of a single college composition class, though, so please correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nIt's pretty well established that there's a fluff principle that makes easily-digested posts get upvotes faster than deeper posts, so image macros and screenshots will tend to rise faster than articles and discussion threads. However, this doesn't really say much about the *content* of what's upvoted, just its effort level. I'd argue that SCT explains why references and other experience-based content can rise above on-topic content and interest-based content.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, symbolic convergence theory says that people tend to form connections with people who have shared experiences over people who have shared interests, especially when said experiences are personally significant or emotionally charged. For instance, if you hear someone's a fan of the same band you are, then you might talk about your favorite albums, or concerts you went to.\n\nAssuming SCT is valid and applies to reddit, it would certainly explain a lot of stuff that happens on the site:\n\n* Particularly... striking posts (cumbox, Colby2012, etc.) tended to get referenced in tangentially-related threads. Those threads might not have been personally significant, but they were shocking and memorable, so they were used as symbols to form connections.\n\n* More generally, meta communities tend to spring up when there are enough emotionally-charged posts/symbols (charged by frustration, entertainment, schadenfreude etc. depending on the community) to form an in-group.\n\n* Meta-posts and meta-comments tend to form when enough people have seen a comment or trend that having seen the comment or trend becomes an experience/symbol that people can connect by. For instance, when extreme atheist posts hit a critical mass, having seen those posts acted like a symbol that people could connect with through satire.\n\nI'm definitely open for feedback; I only have a light understanding of what I'm talking about, and being dead tired probably doesn't make my post more clear.",

Often as well, the situation is not the protagonist's fault.  They were just doing normal things, and craziness exploded around them.

A very interesting AMA about a guy who was extremely bullied back when he was a kid.

The title is optimistic and something that people rally around. Before I even clicked on the comments of this post I thought, \"The top comment will disprove the title and content\". Sure enough, a razor sharp comment put the article in perspective and undermined the grand argument communicated by the title.\n\nSomething tells me this is not just because of a divide of lazy users (just scrolling by and upvoting titles they like) and in depth users (people who read content and discussion). On a larger scale in society, groups tend to hold opposing views or systems on equal terms. One easy example of this is the consistency with which the US will vote in, say, a Democratic President, but vote for a Republican congress. I find it likely that the same user that upvoted that post, would read the comments and upvote the counterargument as an unconscious safeguard against bias or an unconscious recognition of the complexity of an argument.

(I don't actually care, but keeping track of stats is addictive)\n\nFirst mystery: I have 7 link karma. Out of all the submissions I've posted to reddit, most of them have been self posts and the few \"real\" links I've submitted have never been upvoted past 1 (I don't submit often, I'm not complaining, and I also don't care).\n\nI had only 1 link karma for the longest time, but one day it suddenly became 7. The reason why it was strange, is because the only submission I made recently was a self post. Even weirder, that self post had a negative score (displayed 0, but RES showed something like +5 and -15, back when RES could do that). **I have no idea how I got 7 karma from a negative-scored self post.** I made that thread a long time ago. I think it was to /r/FanTheories if anyone cares to try to find it.\n\nThe second mystery, is my current comment karma. I had 3280 comment karma recently, but then I made a bad comment that got downvoted to -15 (not complaining at all). However, my comment only went down to 3276 afterwords. **Somehow, 11 of the 15 downvotes were ignored.** This might have something to do with vote fuzzing, but numbers this low usually aren't fuzzed much, if at all.",

Therefore, $23.94 pays for 22.63 hours of reddit server time.\n\nThis also means each hour of server time costs $0.945279. Multiplied by 24 hours a day 365 days a year, annual Reddit server costs are $8,280.644. This seems obscenely cheap.\n\nWhat other costs are there to Reddit's servers that might be missing here?\n\nEdit: Thanks to /u/barrel_roller for the link. Apparently the box refers to server time for just one server, which I think is a bit different from the wording of the actual text box. In [Yishan's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/howredditworks/comments/1oyhjw/reddit_gold_how_does_the_you_have_helped_pay_for/), he says the gold pays for one of several hundred servers.
