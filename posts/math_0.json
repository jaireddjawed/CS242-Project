Assume that the only force acting on it is Newtonian gravity from the liquid itself. By symmetry, we can see that if the water is initially arranged in a sphere, with no initial movement, then it should stay a perfect sphere. However, what if we arrange it in some sort of perturbed sphere (like an oblate spheroid, for example)? What would the equations of motion look like for this? My intuition tells me it would be cyclic, but I’ve not worked out any of the math yet. The two dimensional case of a circle might be a logical place to start, but is there a one-dimensional analog? Has anyone seen this problem or a related problem before? Any ideas?",

        "text": "After teaching fibrations and fibre bundles. I was asked by a student whether there is a fibration from $S^2$ to $S^1$. I'm looking for a proof that is more or less elementary. Here is one, but it has an unfortunate black box -\n\nMy proof:\n\nAssume such a fibration existed, with model fiber F.\n\nFirst we show that F needs to have trivial fundamental group via the long exact sequence. Then argue by Hurewicz that a fibre has trivial 2nd homotopy. Then prove this contradicts another part of the exactness of the long-exact sequence.\n\nThe Hurewicz argument needs this weird fact that subsets of the plane have no cohomology except for the first. (And zeroeth). But I don't know an easy proof of this... All proofs feel like they'll be ugly. This is the black box.\n\nThe proof is quite straightforward if we assume that the fibration is smooth, too. But weirdly enough, I can't seem to use that for the general case",

Here is my question: This particular university has an application form in which you sent the same things (cv, grades, thesis, opinion letters from past advisor ,etc) and an interview. \n\nHow probable is that you will not get admitted if you have already found an advisor? I am really anxious because I really want to go there and start my phd studies. \n\nIn the universities info about phd studies does not refer anything else about the process, only that the candidate will be assesed in the interview. The interview has two parts , one about achievements in bachelors and one about your masters thesis. \n\nCan anybody share his experience from applying at a european university and the process he followed and tell me ?",

        "text": "The Min-Cut graph partitioning problem is supposedly np-completed, and there are big fancy code libraries dedicated to approximating it (e.g. Metis)\n\n\nHowever, it seems to me that the simple O(n) algorithm of randomly assigning each node to a partition should be an approximate but asymptotically perfect solution.\n\n\nHere’s my line of thinking:\n\n\nThere are n(n-1)/2 pairs of nodes between which there may be edges.\n\n\nIf you make 2 partitions, each partition has n/2 nodes, so (n/2)(n/2-1)/2 = n(n-2)/4 pairs of nodes within each partition.  Between the two partitions, there are n(n-2)/2 pairs.\n\nThe number of pairs that are not contained within a partition is n(n-1)/2 - n(n-2)/2 = [n^2 - n - n^2 + 2n] / 2 = n/2\n\n\nSo if you have randomly distributed edges between nodes randomly split into two partitions, the number of cut edges grows as O(n) while the total number of edges grows as O(n^2).  For large n, the number of cut edges should be negligible.  Even if you have non-equal edge weights, you can assume the cut edges will have average edge weights and arrive at the same conclusion.\n\n\nAm I doing something wrong in my analysis, or is O(n) / O(n^2) edges cut just considered not good enough in practice?",

Everything is going somewhat well  and I absolutely love the classes, aside from proofs. I have such a hard time grasping these abstract concepts. The first time around I admit I could’ve applied myself more but this quarter I went to office hours, group study sessions, and just overall put in so much more effort, but I still failed again. I’m on academic warning because of this and my subpar GPA still following me from my past. Is it worth to keep going? I know its only going to get harder with real analysis. Any advice is appreciated. Sorry for the rant.",
