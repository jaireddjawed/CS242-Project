Discussion threads will be \"refreshed\" each week (i.e., a new discussion thread will be posted for each week). Feel free to ask the community questions, comment on the state of the subreddit, or post content that would otherwise be disallowed.\n\nDo you need help with homework? Have a question about a study you just read? Heard a psychology joke?\n\nNeed participants for a survey? Want to discuss or get critique for your research? Check out our [**research thread!**](https://www.reddit.com/r/psychology/comments/93sopu/psychological_researchsurveys_thread_august/) While submission rules are suspended in this thread, removal of content is still at the discretion of the moderators. [**Reddiquette**](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) **applies.** Personal attacks, racism, sexism, etc will be removed. Repeated violations may result in a ban.\n\n**Recent discussions**\n\n[July 29-August 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/psychology/comments/93spi5/weekly_discussion_thread_july_29august_4/)\n\n[July 15-21](https://www.reddit.com/r/psychology/comments/8zs78s/weekly_discussion_thread_july_1521/)\n\n[July 8-14](https://www.reddit.com/r/psychology/comments/8xlg84/weekly_discussion_thread_july_814/)\n\n[July 1-7](https://www.reddit.com/r/psychology/comments/8vm3l8/weekly_discussion_thread_july_17/)\n\n[June 24-30](https://www.reddit.com/r/psychology/comments/8tmw5z/weekly_discussion_thread_june_2430/)",
