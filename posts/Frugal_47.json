But lately, whenever I do get my lunch outside, I check if there is a university campus nearby. \n\nThe cafetaria usually offers a very decent warm meal at a price that's much lower than most regular lunch venues. I can get simple a warm meal, generally something like rice with curry, Chicken with potato or pasta with sauce for between 4.5 and 6 euro's. Where a lunch at most lunch places would cost at least 10-15 euro's. And as an outsider you are generally allowed entrance and are allowed to make use of the cafetaria so you aren't doing anything wrong. \n\nAre there more people who do this? Or does anyone have suggestions for similar places where you can get a cheap lunch?",

        "text": "Was shaving my head and face in the shower today, and while I've recognized the needless cost of shaving supplies in the past, the thought of it just especially disgusted me today for some reason haha. Didn't even change a cartridge on my Gillette Fusion or Norelco OneBlade... But while I was shaving, the thought of the expense was just unbearable any longer and I had to do something about it. Just had a wedding and bought a new car recently, though, so spending money isn't something I'm into right now. \n\nBut, it's that time of year my family starts asking me to just straight up TELL them what to get me for Christmas. Perfect time to get something more frugal oriented, FOR FREE! Lol!\n\nKnives are a hobby off mine, so straight razors seem a natural progression of that, but my shaky hands would never allow me to safely shave my head (or probably my face, too) with a straight razor. I'd thought about a standard safety-razor type setup for a long time, but I don't think that'd be much better for shaving my head. I remember a friend of my wife's had a Leaf razor she said she loved, and I love the concept, but let's just say I don't take much credence in her opinion.\n\nI found that one of Leaf's primary competitors seems to be a company simply called Supply. So I've started looking into those two and found some people mentioning that I think Gillette, Schick, I believe Parker, and maybe others make a similar product. \n\nLooking for recommendations on good, solid buy once/cry once, utilitarian, well-designed, well-made, frugal-oriented products similar to Leaf. Solid, metal razors built to last that just use simple razor refills; no more cartridges. And preferably something made in the USA, or at least NOT China. \n\nExtra credit: frugal shaving creams or other products. I was just using my Dove bar soap and that actually worked fairly well, but then I found Gillette's 1919 shave cream, and it's only $5 per tube, a little goes a long way, and I really enjoy using it. But I'd be open to other options.",

        "text": " \n\nHey everyone,\n\nI wanted to start a discussion about whether it's always best to go for the cheapest option when making a purchase. As frugal individuals, we love a good deal and are often drawn to the cheapest option. But is it always the best choice, even if it means sacrificing quality or long-term value?\n\nLet's consider a few specific examples. If you're in the market for a new road bike, is it always best to go for the cheapest model, even if it's made of lower-quality components and is more likely to break down? Or if you're in need of new running shoes, is it always best to go for the cheapest option, even if they're not the most supportive or durable?\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking - \"But wait, I'm frugal, not made of money! I can't afford to spend a lot on a road bike or running shoes!\" And I get that, I really do. But hear me out. In these cases, it may be more \"frugal\" in the long run to spend a bit more upfront for a higher-quality option that will last longer and require fewer repairs or replacements. Sure, it may not be the cheapest option in the short term, but in the long term it could save you money and headaches.\n\nOf course, this isn't to say that you should always choose the most expensive option when making a purchase. There's a balance to be struck, and it's important to weigh the long-term value and cost-effectiveness of an item before making a decision.\n\nWhat do you think? Is it always best to go for the cheapest option, or is there value in spending a bit more upfront for a higher-quality item? Share your thoughts and experiences below.\n\nP.S. In case you're wondering, I personally have been using a cheap road bike and a pair of cheap running shoes and they've been just fine, in my humble opinion. But hey, to each their own!",

So, I've figured out that if you can only afford to have 1-2 meals per day, but take these diet pills that absorb water in your system, you can trick your body to make yourself feel full for a longer time between meals (for example; algae pills, Garcinia Cambogia pills, etc.) Just don't overdo it, but it's a good way to cope with the anxiety of having an empty (or almost empty) fridge and cupboard. This has helped me these past weeks when I haven't had too much work and hence little income, so I hope this helps whoever finds it helpful. And... it also forces you to drink more water, so that's good. I would recommend this for only a few weeks, or like I said, for \"very rainy\" days. Peace to everyone.",

Today’s is brought to us by my trip to Macy’s. \n\nLet me preface this by saying that I know Macy’s is on the outs. I just read an article saying all department stores are dying. Good. They probably should at this point. But where is the actual well made, quality item that will last for years and be reliable? Is that time dead?? I can’t explain the feeling it brings up in me. Dread?\n\nI ordered two watches on sale at Macys and a pair of sketchers sneakers. These watches were originally over $100. One had a box that looked like it was tossed around and kicked a few times. The watch face was scratched. This is an item they sent to me?? In a box surrounded by things to make sure it would get to me safe. It wasn’t safe before they sent it. Aside from that, the watch just felt like fake crap. Returned. The other watch I decided to keep was broken and I didn’t realize until I got home. Not ticking. Then the sneakers. Sent in a box that was so crumbled and broken that someone literally wrapped the entire thing in clear packing tape. This is what was sent from Macy’s TO MACY’S to be given to a customer that paid for it??\n\nThe sneakers triggered me. I took them out to inspect, in spite of the box, and there it was. Glue. Visible glue!! Where the sole and material connect. This is something I see all the time lately and I honestly feel like I’m losing my mind. You are honestly selling me shoes, some for over $150, with the adhesive showing where the sole connects??? Maybe it’s irrational, but it’s making me feel insane. \n\nAnd it’s like, where do you go? After department stores. After DSW. What is left, hundreds/thousands of dollars in designer brands, or literal sh*t from Target??? Is everything just going to be a piece of sh*t from Target???\n\nAm I going insane, or this is bothering other people too? I went into a legitimate panic spiral in the car. About how this is greedy capitalism. They pay people nothing. Cutting corners everywhere. No quality control because there’s no quality. And I just sat there, in the car, sincerely questioning what the end game of this all is. \n\nAm I crazy? Lol",

I toss and turn a lot in my sleep... enough to have worn multiple small holes into the fitted sheet. I said enough is enough when I heard a rip during another nightly rotation-- this new hole is pretty big. \n\nI was thinking about using it as a paint drop but I feel like I can salvage something from the sides of the fitted sheet. I don't own a sewing machine, but I can sew well enough-- it just takes a while. \n\nIs there any way to repurpose the 'fitted' area for something? Or is jersey an ideal material for anything you all use? Thank you in advance for helping, I am a little intimidated by the prospect of starting this project but I don't want to toss 3/4 of good material in the trash.",

So assume I get a house around $850,000 in the best school district, with 6% interest rate, 20% down payment, this house would cost us at least $100 - $110 interest rate per day (no principle, property tax or insurance yet). The high school in this district has very competitive program and many kids went to Ivy league schools. My friend raised her 3 kids there and now she has 2 doctors and 1 lawyer.   \n\n\nOur current house is paid off (value $500k) and it is in okay school disctrict. The STEM program is very off, everything is so so. Not bad school but not too great. Our income $200k per year can support the mortgage of the new home. However, with this new debt, we may fall in the “2 paychecks away from being homeless” since the economy still questionable (FED still keep raising rate).  \n\n\nThe question is, would it be wise to go with the house in better school district for education investment ? The $100 per day interest rate is kind of “against” my frugal discipline. Anyone has been in this situation? Or if you have never been in this situation, would you move or stay where you are?  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "text": "It's the holiday season now and gifts are quite costly. Someone making meals as gifts for their community reminded me of some of the frugal gifts I've created using bread as the star of the show and I thought I'd share some. Perhaps you have similar gifts to suggest and we'll get a hardy discussion going. \n\nAnyone can bake. You can make incredible, simple loaves of bread for as little as 30 cents US. If you have a loved one with dietary restrictions, you can find a recipe to suit them. One of the best resources is King Autrthur Baking. Another excellent site for super frugal (regular) bread is Budget Bytes. While cookies can be festive, everyone gets buried in them. Bread makes a great addition to any meal and it brings leftovers up a level. You can also make dough and freeze it, so it's easy to make a dough on one night off and do all your baking on a different day. And even if you lack an oven, you can do this by Googling \"stovetop bread\".\n\nNervous cooks can easily make: no-knead bread recipes, soda bread, muffins, and shortbreads.\n\nAside from making a good tasting loaf, the key to gifting it well is in packaging. Get brown paper bags and channel your Inner Martha Stewart by decorating the bags. You don't need to be artistic. Use thick cardboard or a dry dish sponge and cut the shape of a star, a tree, or whatever you like, make sure it's thick enough to hold, and use paint to stamp the wrapped bread. Tie with sisal twine in a festive color.\n\nIf your budget allows, you can add one or more additional treats...\n\nGo to a local farmers market and look for small jars of honey and/or jam. If your farmers market has it, look for small portions of locally made cheese and/or seasonal \"dry\" salami. These gourmet treats tend to be cheaper straight from the source. If you live rural, see if any local farms have seasonal stands right on the farm or in town. You can really personalize things at this point if you know favorite flavors.\n\nWith more contents, you need more containment space. You can go to thrift stores or the dollar store and find baskets. Give them an upgrade using bows, paint, or anything fun. Tuck in your gift treats. Practical containers like baking pans or tins with lids are perfect, plentiful, and cheap. If you're really trying to save money, wrap a cardboard box in dollars store gift wrap or break out the paints. \n\nSerious Upgrades:\n\nAdd a box of fine tea, hot chocolate packets, or coffee if it's someone special. \n\nBuy a large bag of clementines or other small seasonal fruits and add enough to each basket for each household member. Dried fruits from value stores like Lydil and Aldi make wonderful additions too. \n\nAdd a jar of mixed beans and herbs in a sachet as a dry soup mix or make and freeze soup in Mason jars. \n\nAdd a mass market paperback or clean, like-new book for readers. They can curl up with a book and a snack of bread and honey and sip something pleasant. \n\nI hope this helps someone make their holidays cozy and bright!",
