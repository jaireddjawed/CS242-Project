However, I did find parts of Mrs Westaway confusing and I'm hoping a more attentive reader can help me understand a couple parts!\n\nAt one point Hal is ruminating over what the housekeeper said as Hal was sneaking away  - Mrs. Warren says \"you never should never have come *back*\" and Hal wondered what she meant by coming \"back\" but I couldn't find anywhere that Hal had actually been to the mansion. Maggie went back alone it's clearly stated she left Hal with Maud so when would Hal have visited her grandmother?\n\nAlso when Hal and Ezra are stopped at the reststop during the snow storm he says something that seems to confirm to Hal that he's her father but I don't think she then states what that clue ever was.\n\nI've actually read the book twice and still did not grasp these details. I think it's intended to be confusing so maybe some things are just meant to be unknown?",

I could sit on my phone(which I find so boring) for hours and never fall asleep. But if I read instead it's like a sleeping pill it really sends me to sleep. I'm absolutely in love with the books I'm reading I think about them and all I wanna do is read but it really keeps sending me to sleep. I think I'm just so comfy but I don't wanna sit at the table to read it's just not comfy for me but it's taking me soooo long to get through a book. If I read in the morning I fall back asleep, during the day reading session I fall asleep. I've read 10 pages today having to come on my phone and stretch and shake my face to try not fall asleep I'm absolutely about to fall asleep right now. Any advice ?",

If more people are interested, we can create a book club! If you know a cool online Book Club PLEASE let me know, too.\nI would love to read in german, but the german book subreddit is a bit weird.\n\nPersonally I read alot of fantasy and her sub genres (like urban, high, low, romantasy and alot of different subs). Additionally I really enjoy Dark academia, Mystery and sometimes a little YA/NA. even smut is nice sometimes. \n\nMain aspect of my search is the communication about books we are reading. It would be nice if you have interests in new books, releases and a few hypes and trends so we can talk about it, but I‘m loving a good old book the same amount. \n\nThe plan is to read 1 book a month so everyone is free to read more next to it (if they want it). \nWe can create a chat group in whatsapp, and we can talk in discord/Zoom/etc. \n\nAbout me: I‘m 26F. Your age is not important, even if you are 60+. \n\nPlease remember I‘m looking for German readers only. If you are interested pls comment or message me. \n\nETA: i will not read CoHo, but i love female authors. But it doesn‘t matter.\n\nOK THX",

I opened my eyes without the one meager idea that where was I?\nI saw myself in a dark small room that seemed like it had been abandoned a long time ago, the ceilings were painted in white and the walls and the floor was filled with black and white tiles, similar to a piano or the believed abstraction of asylums I had.\nI couldn’t reminisce of about the apprehension that captivated me, seemed like it had been consigned to oblivion.\nSuddenly my father came to my mind, he would always wake up early in the morning just to ask me why am I sleeping in his house and who am I?\nUnder the heavy prescription of the doctor's, all those pills finally made him go insane.\nthey thought that the pills could slow down the process of this fucking disease but everything just got worse...\nAmnesia never had any mercy upon its victims and every one of those people fell into a maze made by their sick mind\nI prefered to think of their minds as a book with empty pages, not totally blank though there are signs and struggles that haunts them even in the daylight.\nHe decided to end things, just like how he ended the relationships with my mother\nOr how he got fired from his job.\n as people say he ended it the easy way, the poor bastard didn’t even remembered his own name but managed to somehow fire a .50 caliber revolver to his head through his mouth.\nEven though I just locked myself in my room because I knew what exactly happened I still dreamed it like I saw everything, with every bit of detail I dreamed of my father's brain on the favorite sofa of my mother and all over the yellowish warm haze that the wall had from the lamp.\nIt was haunting me maybe because I didn’t dare to face it, I wouldn’t call myself a coward because after all I took care of him the whole time after mother left..\nThe memories came flooding back just like a river after a heavy unstoppable raining through the gaps of mountains in the nightfall.\nI wasn’t the kind of person to go back and stay in the past just to reminisce about things I never wanted to happen, I just stayed away from them and as soon as I came to evoke those moments I ran, as fast as I could and with all the strength I had until I breakdown and fall into my knees.\nIt didn’t matter until I started to cough blood after hours of running, burned out to the last drops and dead on one’s feet, I was going in the same way as my dad and it seemed like that’s the fate that we all come down to, even though it more looked like a doom,\nA door to agony and unrequired torment.\nThe traumatic living of my mother left its scars but that was more like a token of remembrance something that I had to carry within all my life without sharing a bit of it to any stranger, after all those burdensome nights my mother decided to give the slip.\nThat night my father didn’t even realized that she had left the house forever, he only sat down on the sofa and watched TV, it took him really long before he understood why there’s no dinner at the table and why the air in the house feels heavy.\nThe night-after the weather shed bitter rain and my father dissolved his whole existence into tears at the dinner table, with every drop of water the feeling of burden weighed so heavy on his soul that he could barely breath, only a glance of his eyes sights was needed to be seen to realize whats going on inside his head  I only watched him because there was nothing anybody could do for him, I’m sure he never wanted any of this to happen, he believed in destiny and belief of that nothing can be changed by the hands of a creation made by the creator of all.\nHe relied on something without doubting its existence, the religion and its convictions or thy shall called the “order of things” was dead set on, there was nothing that could change the old ways and people like my father were always persistent toward it.\nBefore all else It was the ignorance that shattered his life into pieces similar to a sharp-edged knife that wreaked a havoc on all the people around him.\nNonetheless I never felt the hatred down in my heart, I thought by the end of it I’ll become a black beast as a symbolization of anathema for my father.\nThey buried him near an oak tree in a cemetery behind the church he invocated his divine oath to, no familiar face could be seen among all those people that day, maybe all those co-workers and church mates didn’t have enough time to know him well, cause if they had a glimpse of how he really was they wouldn’t even bother to attend his funeral, he was born into this world in a dead body, seemed like he left this world in solitude just like how he was give birth to.\n ",

        "text": " \n\nI cannot get enough of Cathy. She's the most interesting character in the book, in my opinion. I love how the author describes her psychopathic traits and how easily people fall to her whims. Has anyone else here read this book? What are your favorite parts and what are your thoughts on Cathy?\n\n Some of my favorite quotes:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n' Samuel suddenly realized that he was making his speech last to prevent  \nsilence from falling on the table. He paused, and the silence dropped. Cathy  \nlooked down at her plate while she ate a sliver of roast lamb. She looked up  \nas she put it between her small sharp teeth. Her wide-set eyes  \ncommunicated nothing. Samuel shivered. '\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n' It is my belief that Cathy Ames was born with the tendencies, or lack of  \nthem, which drove and forced her all of her life. Some balance wheel was  \nmisweighted, some gear out of ratio. She was not like other people, never  \nwas from birth. And just as a cripple may learn to utilize his lack so that he  \nbecomes more effective in a limited field than the uncrippled, so did Cathy,  \nusing her difference, make a painful and bewildering stir in her world. '\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n' She made people uneasy but not so that they wanted to go away from her.  \nMen and women wanted to inspect her, to be close to her, to try to find what  \ncaused the disturbance she distributed so subtly. And since this had always  \nbeen so, Cathy did not find it strange. '",

        "text": "Hope this is the right sub for this kind of question.\n\n\nI've always wanted to pick up reading as a regular habit, but all my attempts have been to no avail. I have finished a few books in the past (probably no more than ten) when in fact the books I did start are much much more.\n\n\nI would start a book and leave it halfway for another. It could be an attention span thing, or maybe it's because I'm 22 and desperate to catch up with the smart book readers around me.. who are the same age and younger. Anyway, I then would pick those book/s I put aside to try and at least finish them (also at the expense of the book I left them for.. I have a serious problem lol), but at that point the plot and the characters are lost to me.\n\n\nSo there's my brain trying to convince me \"go on, you did read that part. Why go back again and waste time? You know what happens. Besides, you'll pick everything up as you go.\" and then there's myself not knowing what's going on and getting frustrated. So I drop the book altogether. \n\n\n\nI'm wondering whether at this point its even useful if I try and finish those books. I guess there could be two options:\n\n1. Pick up where I left. Which brings me to the question: Which book then? How do I choose that? Does it even matter?\n\n2. Start fresh. Even the books I left unfinished. Another question: should I start with a completely new book? Or one of unfinished books?",

I decided to read some self help books to improve myself, the first one being Atomic Habits by James Clear. When I started to read the book I really enjoyed myself and still do as it was very relatable to me. But now I am facing a problem that I keep forgetting about what I read about at the beginning. I am only able to remember the core concept. So I wanted to know if there is any daily habit like journaling or something else that I should also do to be able to remember what I read? as I want to make reading a daily habit and keep on reading many more books.",

As far as my wife has been able to discern from the little bit of research she did, she thinks it was printed in 1864. There is no publication date listed in the book itself, so we kinda just had to do the best we could. She found a listing for it (same publication company, date, location, etc) in the Library of Congress apparently. I have a difficult time believing it truly is that old, but she is more knowledgeable regarding this than I am, so who am I to argue. \n\nAnyway, considering how old this *seems* to be, I would love to keep it in as nice condition as possible. Is there any way to safely fix this at home? I kinda wanna avoid just taping it down or something, and Ive never really had to do any kind of book repair like this before. \n\nAny suggestions that wont cost an arm and a leg?",

This because I wouldn’t get discouraged when there was sentences or words I didn’t understand, I found that I always gave up or spent way too long looking up almost every word on the page when the book was in paper form. I would put it on when cooking dinner or cleaning, slowly I noticed that my boyfriend (who never reads except for studying) started creeping into the room while I was listening. At first, he just helped me with random words (as he speaks the native tongue) but he gradually he started joining me and actually getting invested in the story. We listen to one or two chapters every day now during dinner or before bed and I absolutely love it. It also has been such a huge motivation bettering my language as he’s always so excited to continue the story. Anyways we only have two books in the series left, and I’m naturally wondering what next? Any books you just absolutely loved, preferably a series?",
