        "text": "There are hundreds of examples of Bible prophecy in which it is claimed that a verse or verses make a prediction that was fulfilled later; this is one of the alleged proofs of the Bible's accuracy.  However, the prediction and its fulfillment, in all instances I'm aware of, are both within the Bible.  Since the possibility exists that later Bible writers deliberately crafted their story to conform to earlier verses, these claims don't seem credible to me any more than the Harry Potter series must be true because \"prophecies\" in one part are \"fulfilled\" in another part of the same book.  \n\n\nThere are also predictions that are claimed to have occurred in historical times; for example, after the State of Israel was established, verses were cited that with a little mathematical manipulation, \"predicted\" that this would occur in 1948.  However, this wasn't recognized beforehand; only afterwards.  The same holds true for the \"Seventy Weeks\" prophecy in Daniel.  \n\n\nAre there any Biblical prophecies that were fulfilled in historical times, and were recognized as such *before* their fulfillment?",

I mostly like to read about all the symbolism and basically know all the historical and religious facts (even read the Bible just for information purposes), but I cannot feel that connection I do when I practice meditation for the chakras or yoga (with some Buddhist practices incorporated), it just something I like to watch and listen to (like the Liturgy), but not something that I necessary feel conected to.\n\n And I tried reading lots of prayers, but they just don t appeal to me, it's all praising the Lord, Jesus and the Holy Spirit over and over (not that I didn t know that is sth most monotheistic religions do, but I just don t find any diversity in it, rarely did I found a good prayer that made me feel something deeper).\n\nI also like studying about cults, mysticism from different cultures/religions and many other concepts that aren t found in the Christian dogma. I just connect to those more, but I feel somehow guilty that I have respect for Orthodoxism, but I just don't find it suitable for me. Somehow I acknowledge God (Holy Trinity) but I just let Him be, tried interacting but it just didn t work yet.\n\nDoes this make sense? \nAm I in a journey of spiritual guidance?

        "text": "Hi. Does anybody worship Reality or Existence? I lean towards panentheism, and I feel this is moreorless where I am going. To be honest, I struggle to accept the evils in the world, and I also struggle to accept the hardships with which I seem to be visited a lot; so I feel the need for a Principle of something Real to cleave to. And this seems to be where it is going. I already have a reverence for Truth, and this seems to be where it is leading me. I am not strong enough on my own, I need to _accept_ something external to me that has within it beauty (and yes horror) that somehow keeps me going when I want to pack it in.\n\nI have been calling it 'God', but I am unsure of this... I wonder if 'Reality' or 'Existence' is more where where I am? So this makes me wonder, does anybody worship Reality of Existence?\n\nI had always paid attention to the horrors and my own hardships, but not enough attention to the good; the good does not justify the horrors, but they are what they are. I can cannot recast the world. I can no longer shake my first at the sky. Yes, I feel myself surrender. I've had enough. Whatever way I can employ to perhaps relax, I will consider it. And so it has come to me: that one can feel in life both a joy and a pain at once, a joy-pain or something. And I think this is maybe what 'bittersweet' is getting at. Something we are meant to cry because things are beautiful, because they brought us joy. It is right to cry, right to fear, but it is also dight to smile and right to feel the excitement of the wind in our hair, life in our sails. We have to learn to seize upon it all. To try to see in this absurd universe of ours every little thing worth loving for when each in their dancing motion presents itself to us in its own tip-tappity-tap way. In a sense, we have to learn to love Reality, if our reality is not so cruel.\n\nIt does not seem to me easy, and it may be a lifetime's effort of always seeking out the good; but to deny love and joy does not seem right, nor does to continue to suffer.",

If we are living in a simulation, and Neil Degrasse Tyson gives that a 50:50 chance, does that not mean the simulation, and thus the universe we live in (maybe), has a Creator?  A Dev team so to speak.  That acknowledging the existence of these \"Devs\", getting their attention, and asking nicely might get loot boxes dropped on you during game play and eventually lead to you exiting the simulation?\n\nI see Religion as a set of instructions from the last guy that was able to see through the simulation and hear the devs chatting in the background.  We don't know exactly why it works, but this is how he heard it last time, by following these specific rules.  And here's how you file a bug report.  They don't promise they can address each one individually, but they read them all and will take it under advisement. \n\nThoughts?",

        "text": "For example, where asked to explain how Adam and Eve were \"created\" they will provide something like this and include references to back it all up with evidence:\n\n&gt;In the beginning: self-assembly of increasingly complex molecular (RNA) self-learning systems, caused the emergence of membrane enclosed self-learning cells, which caused the emergence of self-learning multicellular animals like us, humans. Along the way was a molecular/genetic level [chromosome speciation](https://www.pnas.org/content/102/suppl_1/6535) event causing almost immediate [reproductive isolation](https://www.kqed.org/quest/5239/and-then-there-were-44) from earlier ancestors, a genetic bottleneck through one couple, who by scientific naming convention hereby qualify as Chromosome Adam and Eve.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In chromosome fusion speciation there is first a population of 47 chromosome ancestors, who from one of their parents still retained the normal unfused chromosome pair, for the cell to switch areas of on or off, when necessary to compensate for loss of gene function at the tangled fusion site of the other. Best of both worlds, to help make a chromosome fusion like ours a survivable change. There is next a generational population of 46's where one of the now reproductively isolated couples in it started the lineage that left the African forest tree paradise, all the rest of the lineages ultimately died off in. At the time there would have been a number of families giving birth to 46's who after maturing only needed to find each other. The fusion may have caused enough behavioral change for us to not want to live with the 48's anymore.\n\nYou'll almost always end up with science papers and educational video's for essentially \"How our creator works\" and they may be annoyed by loaded words like \"created\" and religious debates over whether a \"creator\" exists or not. Would likely not be affiliated with any religion, or attend religious services. Will admire biologist Thomas Huxley for his scientific work but what people now define as Agnosticism looks to them like armchair warriors who waste too much time talking about whether a \"God\" exists or not, it's scientifically irrelevant.\n\nTheir favorite area of science may now be this pertaining to biological intelligence:\n\n&gt;**Cognitive biology** is an emerging science that regards natural [cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition) as a [biological function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_function). It is based on the theoretical assumption that every [organism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism)—whether a single cell or [multicellular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicellular)—is continually engaged in systematic acts of cognition coupled with intentional behaviors, i.e., a [sensory-motor coupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory-motor_coupling).[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_biology#cite_note-2) That is to say, if an organism can sense stimuli in its environment and respond accordingly, it is cognitive.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive\\_biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_biology)\n\nWhat is the precise name for a person like this?",

They explained that they discovered their purpose in life was to lead me and others to what they know.

So, people who don't believe in God or Allah shouldn't say bad things about the Holy Koran and the Bible, because peace is hard to find and their actions affect not only them but also the world we live in.\n\nToday, crime, violence, a lack of safety, and greed run the world. Whatever words, thoughts, and actions a person does in this life will eventually bear fruit. Because of this, people will get back what they put into the world. The harvest can even be annoying or scary. People who make fun of God are sowing the seeds of their own destruction. God's perfect justice will hold them accountable for what they did.\n\nThe people featured in this video are some who mocked Christianity and had negative things happen to them. While there is no way to know if God's wrath was behind all disasters that happened to these people who mocked Christianity, what we know for sure is that human beings should not make such disrespectful and arrogant statements. \n\n[https://youtu.be/PKY2GPuwUXI](https://youtu.be/PKY2GPuwUXI)",

        "text": "See the murals from San Marco mural of the “Last Judgment” and the Florence Baptistery.  \n\nFor example, if Hindus and Buddhist and others believe that we should respect the lives of animals, then the karma for eating animals might be in those religion’s belief, that the person in the next life comes back as an animal and is eaten by humans.  \n\nI sometimes wonder if the depictions of hell found in so many Catholic institution’s murals are really just a depiction of karma for the act of eating meat.  In image after image, I find so many depicting hell as being a place full of animalistic creatures consuming humans, sometimes even by placing them in kettles and cooking them. \n\nAssuming the mural’s artist believed that both humans and animals are valued the same, then a role reversal between animals and humans, would seem like something that artist might convey.  So why do these obviously karma derived images repeatedly find themselves in the murals of Catholic religious buildings when Catholic theology makes eating meat acceptable?  Is there any basis in Catholic theology for punishment in hell for the treatment of animals on earth?",

        "text": "Hi. I wonder about this: how can anybody believe that the utmost reality of all things comes from a multitude of entities, forces, substances, whatever you wish to call them? It strikes me as counter-intuitive. Say you have two gods. Just two. How would they co-create a world that all fit together? What would govern the relations between these two entities? Prevent one from just compleyely undoing the creation of the other, etc.? What common denominator would they have so that they and their substances from which they formed the world could interoperate? This is why it seems increasingly 'polytheists' tend to believe that their gods are either aspects of or emanations of ('creations' of) some highest entity, one God/Taos/Fate/Wyrd/Logos/Absolute/Monad/etc. How can there be essentially multiple existences? What is Existence in Itself? This is God/Taos/etc. This is the highest god, the only god worthy of a capital-G; the rest, if they exist at all, are, as I say, more like aspects of the One God or 'higher' beings; disembodied super-spirits of some kind. Who knows. My point is, even if you are a 'polytheist' having a God/Fate/Monad/whatever that all comes from, exists within, and is governed by, so to speak, is just much more intuitive. Without such a concept it seems to me true chaos is much more likely—and yet, day on day, everything seems to work. Our whole sense of logic and truth implies some degree of continuity. Heck, philosophy and theology imply this. Multiple Gods—yes, with a capital-G—truly seems unruly. One Ultimate God makes more sense to me.\n\nThis is not an endorsement of any of the popular monotheisms by the way, this is just my intuitive logic on the matter.\n\nEven in mythology I think it is said that the Gods are rules by some kind of 'Fate' or 'Wyrd'. And in Norse mythology at least, the Gods did not always exist, and they can die. What kind of God is that? A god with a lowercase-G. What Law rules even the gods? What are the gods made of? Whence do they come? All of this is the One God, known by many names, by many philosophies and religions.\n\nOne God. One Existence. One universal Truth. One Logic. One Source of All, one Substance. One Law that rules All. This is God, God of gods.",

And there are two trees bearing fruit each month to eat.  It seems those things might be what a person desired and thus they received.  But if a person valued violence, then he might receive that in the afterlife as well.  For example, I have read an account of Valhalla in which the Vikings, who loved to fight, were able to battle everyday and then be resurrected each night to battle again the next day.  Many people love the competitive nature of combat, and so for them, that could be heaven.  It would be sort of like getting to play a video game everyday knowing that you would get a new character if you died.  In each case, such a thing may be heaven for a particular person, at least during a phase of their life.  \n\nIs there a consistent belief amongst religions that basically says a person gets what he desires most, whether that is stated directly or not by the religion?  In other words, is the persons heaven and hell basically a reflection of themselves that they must deal with.  And one person’s heaven, might be hell for another.",

        "text": "Hi. I saw something by W.B. Yeats, the Irish aristocrat, I think it is fair to say, poet and folklore-enthusiast. It made me wonder: why do today's Celtic neopagans seem so 'progressive'? Y.B. Yeats seems to have bordered on fascism in his political thinking, presumably driven by a common sense of 'The West is dying' among romantic conervative types. In any case, he was the more conservative kind of Irish nationalist; far from the Irish nationalists of today. He seems to have been a confused mix of Christian (he was raised so) and pagan. I am sure there are probably others of his kind whose names I do not yet know. Today's Germanic neopaganism is often influenced by the German romantic nationalists of the 1800s and 1900s--yes, some were Nazis; so that I assume is why Germanic neopaganism is often at the very least proudly ethnic in character. How then did Celtic neopaganism seemingly turn out so 'progressive', so hippie? Does this just reflect the more 'progressive' culture of the more Celtic countries, perhaps due to their perceived history of being maligned by England? England tends to lean more conservative next to its Celtic cousins, perhaps due to our arguably stronger history, or our imperial history, either of which can bring a sense of superiority; or our greater heterogeneity in England compared to the Celtic countries which at times can lead to inter-ethnic tensions, and hence a more conservative attitude.\n\nAnybody got any wisdom to shine on this topic? The Celtic neopagans seem most 'progressive' out of (revivalist) modern neopagans.\n\nAnd then we have the Slavic neopagans who seem more comfortably conservative, also. Granted, on reddit at least, you will probably find the more 'progressive' kind; but if you look up living Slavic neopagan movements they seem to lean that way. This is perhaps a reflection of the generally at least less 'progressive' bent of Central and Eastern Europe.",

We are reading translations from the Greek language, in which these books were written, and something is always lost in translation.\n\nNot only that, we're not reading translations of the originals because we don't have the originals of these books, or of any other books of the New Testament. What we have are copies made centuries later, many of them many, many centuries later.\n\nThese thousands of copies that we have are all different from one another in lots of little ways, and sometimes in big ways. There are places where we don't know what the authors of the New Testament originally wrote.\n\nFor some Christians, that's not a problem because they don't have a high view of scripture. For others it's a very big problem.\n\nWhat does it mean to say that God inspired the words of the text, if we don't have the words? Moreover, why should one think that God performed the miracle of inspiring the words of the Bible, if he didn't perform the miracle of preserving the words of the bible? If he meant to give us his very words, why didn't he make sure we received them?\n\nThe problem of not having the originals of the New Testament though, is a problem for everyone. Not simply for those who believe that the Bible was inspired by God, but for all of us.\n\nI think the bible is the most important book in the history of Western civilisation. It continues to be cited in public debates over gay rights, abortion, over whether to go to war with foreign countries, over how to organise and run our society.\n\nBut how do we interpret the New Testament? It's hard to know what the words of the New Testament mean, if we don't know what the words were.\n\n# Professor Bart D.
