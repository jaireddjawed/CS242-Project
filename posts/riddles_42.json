Used to want to be a chef. Wanted to join the army. Was in the cadets. Grew up in England. Has an arrogant personality and likes characters as such e.g. James Bond, Barney Stinson. And just loves the outdoors in general\n\nI know this is a bit of long shot but any guesses at all? \n\nEdit: typos. \nEdit 2: OMG he gave me a clue. He died in 1805!!!\nEdit 3: Answer: [spoiler](#s \"It's Horatio Nelson. 'Sailed the seas and beat up the French and Spanish' directly quoted from him.

I’ve been working on this for... well... about three weeks, now, and it’s driving me insane. \nSo- the prompt is “what common supermarket item can be formed by filling in the six blanks in these two words with three letters,  twice, once in the reverse order of the other?” or something to that extent. Essentially it gives you this:\nS _ _ _ (space MAYBE) _ _ L _\nand the spaces should be filled in this order, with A B and C representing letters 1, 2, and 3, respectively: A B C C B A\nThere may or may not be a space somewhere in the word- the formatting was messed up on the sheet (he copied and pasted the question from somewhere online, which I can’t find and he claims to be unable to find, also). It seems like there would be a space, because I distinctly remember the question talking about “two words”- not sure if it just means a compound word or two separate words. \nAnyway- if you can help me out, please do!! \n\nedit: if you can’t see the blanks in the post (I can’t on my phone) they should be S [BLANK] [BLANK] [BLANK] [BLANK] [BLANK] L [BLANK].

        "text": "There is a magical kingdom in which the most common method of murder is poisoning. The poisons work differently here, if someone drinks a poison the only way to stop the effects is to drink a stronger poison.\nThe king is always worried about being murdered and usurped, and since the strongest poison makes the drinker effectively immune to being poisoned he creates a test to find the best poison he can. He finds the two best alchemist in the land, the kings personal alchemist, and a village herbalist. The king gives them each one week to create the best poison, and at the end of the week they will come back and drink the others poison and then their own. since a stronger poison nullifies a weaker one the man who created the strongest poison will survive and continue to create poisons for the king.\nThe herbalist knows that the alchemist is much better, and he has no hope of creating a stronger poison so he devises a plan to game the system and survive. \nWhat does he do to win the competition, and what does this mean for the king if he was ever to be poisoned.",
