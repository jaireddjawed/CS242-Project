        "text": "So last night on Lifetime's Child Genius one of the competitors, Graham, spoke out against the Big Bang Theory.\n\n[This](http://www.lessthanreality.com/2015/01/child-genius-child-and-his-religion.html) is the only site that has any information on this right now.\n\n[You can watch the episode (Episode 3) here.](http://www.mylifetime.com/shows/child-genius/video/full-episodes). You do have to sign in to watch it, though.\n\nFrom the start of the series it's made clear by Graham and his mother that they are Christian. His mother, Tracy, drills him on geography and Bible verses. Tracy and Graham often make comments about Jesus and are seen praying for Graham to do well.\n\nLast night, though, Graham made some interesting comments though. These comments came about because the second topic of the night was astronomy. Before Graham is shown during this round he's shown  making a comment to the effect of, \"I hope they don't ask about the Big Bang theory, because it's wrong\". His mother makes the comment, \"I hope Graham doesn't speak out about his faith\". Then, when Graham takes the podium, Graham feels the need to quote Genesis 1 and make a statement about his faith. The camera swings out to Graham's mother and the audience. His mother looks pained and the audience have a look on their face that seems to say \"Seriously?\".\n\nI find it funny that people like Tracy drill these things into their children's minds and then tell seemingly get embarrassed when their children repeat them. It's funny when a Christian says God spoke to them and other Christians get freaked out by it. It makes me wonder if these people would believe someone if they said they committed a crime because they were possessed by a devil. They seem to grasp on some acute level that this stuff is out there, but don't try to dispel any of it.\n\nGraham emphatically stated that the Big Bang is false. I'm not aware that the Bible describes the exact manner in which God created everything. It doesn't occur to Graham (and others like him) that God could have created the universe with the Big Bang. Graham is disinterested in topics like astronomy (and probably biology too) because of his faith. It's a shame.",

        "text": "The frontal attack on religion is satisfying, sure, but does it yield the best results? Are there less fundamentalists the next day? Or did we just convince someone who was already convinced, without improving didly in the lives of these crazy and desperate people who are prepared to blow themselves and others to pieces for the ludicrous promise of a better afterlife, or for a false sense of justice? \n\nThat’s right, we’re atheists here, so we need to remember that terrorists are people, like you and me! After all, the only Beast we should believe in, is the beast within.  \n\nNow hear me out. I’m not saying Islam isn’t worthy of criticism. It is! Just like all monotheistic religions, it is authoritarian and utterly repulsive in its literal interpretation. This vision of the world must be fought tooth and nail. ISLAMISM (as opposed to Islam) must be defeated.\n\nBut to do that we must understand that Fundamentalist Islam is only one of the factors that led to the brutal attacks in Paris. It is the catalyst that makes a brewing pot of frustration and injustice explode.\n\nA substantial part of the Islamic world, for example, is poorly educated and disenfranchised. These people are not seeing any of the advantages of modernity. To the contrary, robots are raining death from the sky in countries like Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, and pastafari knows where else.  \n\nAnother substantial part thinks they’re living as second class citizens in Europe, with tacit prejudice in every corner of society. For many young men in this cohort, the republican values touted by the west sound hollow and hypocrite.  \n\nThese are some of the ponds where Al Qaeda and ISIS go fishing for new recruits. Islam is the easy solution that hooks the foolish, the grieving, the powerless, the frustrated and the desperate, reeling them into the arms of the cynical and the crazy. \n\nWe cannot get caught in the same trap! Let’s not go for the simplistic solution where we simply say: “Islam is the problem and there is no such thing as a moderate Muslims” . \n\nThis is nonsense. Not all Imams interpret jihad as a holy war against the west. Turkey is a democracy with more than 80 million people. Iran is an immensely complex country with bustling metropolitan centers that the ruling theocracy is struggling to keep in check. Many Muslim immigrants have successfully integrated into their new societies and embrace secular values, especially in the new world. There are many, many shades of gray.\n\nIf we embrace this childish and dangerous view of a clash between Islam and the West, we are playing on the extremists’ turf. We are giving them fodder in their local culture wars so they can say: “see, they are attacking our way of life”. \n\nWhat we really should be doing is thinking of ways to take the wind out of sails of these fundamentalist, to provide another outlet for the very real anger and frustration. \n\nHow? That’s the million dollar question, of course. I’m not going to pretend I know the answer . But I can brainstorm: We could shower imams who denounce violence in money and support. We could shore up moderate nations like Jordan and Turkey (EU membership?). We could try to strike peace with Iran if they abdicate their support for Hezbollah and accept Israel as a nation. We could drain the house of Saud of resources by investing like crazy in energy generation of all sorts and sizes. European countries could take a page from America and adopt a more republican attitude in dealing with their immigrants. And then there is of course the hornets’ nest that is Israel and Palestine. Let’s not give up on that. \n\nThese are all extremely hard endeavors with a more than significant prospect of failure. But surely it’s more realistic than thinking we can ‘convert’ more than one billion people by drawing their prophet and telling them everything they believe in is bullshit, even if it is our right to do so.\n\nI don’t know. Maybe I’m wrong. But I just think that when you’re faced with a Hydra, you don’t cut off its head. You lull it to sleep and starve it to death\n",

        "text": "Hi guys, I'm an 18 year old Filipino atheist who was raised a Catholic. Ever since I was young I questioned the existence of God but always chose to believe in it since I guess it was more convenient. One of the main reasons that I held on to the idea of God was, of course, the fact that I could pray and have anything I wanted granted. I guess you could say that God was my personal genie. I went to church everyday since, of course, that was the right thing to do. Prayer meant that you were a good person. Well, one of the things that i often prayed for was for my parents to stop fighting since these \"fights\" (which arent really fights but more of my dad just physically and verbally abusing my mom) got very violent and for no serious reason. I prayed almost every time these fights occurred. I begged, and pleaded and bargained with God. At one point my dad even got angry at me when he saw me praying whole they were fighting. But I held on to God, and I didn't give up because I believed that some day my prayer would be granted. My parents are a member of a Catholic organization known as the CFC and they regularly hold prayer meetings and assemblies and such, and often I can hear these adults talking about their hardships in life and how god had helped them through this. I know that these people (especially my parents)  truly believe that they have a personal relationship with God, and this is something that is very important to their lives. I went to church every Sunday and all my friends did as well. God was the norm. \n\nAs I went into high school however, things changed for me. Having greater access to the Internet led me to websites such as this one as well as 4chan, where criticism of belief is quite common. I had an \"us and them\" attitude back then, so I just believed those people were wrong. Slowly however, I began to realize that their arguments made sense, and that the only reason in was still choosing to remain believing in God was to keep to that status quo. So my attitude slowly changed. Instead of thinking that God was someone like in the old testament, I chose to believe that he just didn't interfere with the world. My views on controversial topics such as abortion, free speech, and religious freedom became noticeably different from my parents. Whenever they noticed this, they asked me where I had learned that from. They implied that my school was not teaching me good things, that I was being corrupted, being influenced by the lies of the evil one. Over time I realized that if God doesn't care what we do, then he isn't relevant anyway. I eventually admitted to myself that I had become an atheist, and then only reason I had been trying to cling to the hope of God was out of fear, and the small hope that I could go to heaven. I don't believe in these things anymore, because I can truly say that I see no evidence or reason for these things to be true. I think one of the things that really holds people to religion is fear. \n\n\nIf I were to explain to my parents that I no longer want to go to church or pray, they would label me as evil. They would think that I had succumbed to the lies of Satan. My friends and family would hate me and everybody would be trying to change me, believing that something was wrong with me. There's nothing wrong with me, I just don't have faith. No matter how much my parents will try to get me to have a personal relationship with God, it just won't happen because I have no faith. But I feel trapped. I still live with my parents and my brother because my college isn't overseas (I live in Thailand and go to school here as well).. Until I'm 21, I still have to go to church every Sunday and pray along with my family. I find it pointless and I feel like a lying piece of shit having to pretend that I believe in these things when I don't. Religion is a huge aspect of the community that I'm a part of, and this is an entire community that would look on me as evil if I admitted that in don't believe in God. I find the \"us and them\" attitude fucking disgusting and I don't want to be part of this church any longer. \n\nSo I know I'll still pretend to be religious for 4 more years (even if I hate myself for it) but I'm really scared for the consequences and then fallout that will occur between me and my family when I do announce my atheism. No doubt my family will be looked down upon for \"failing to raise me\". They still have to pay for my higher education and I'd know that they will resent me for this. It will definitely influence their decisions as well as their love for me. It disgusts me that such a trivial matter could affect and potentially destroy relationships and I don't know how I'm going to deal with the aftermath. This isn't something small for them, catholicism is has been forced upon me as systematic indoctrination from the day I could understand language. My parents believe that the only purpose they have in life is to serve and glorify (a nonexistent) God. They believe that being atheist is evil and selfish. But to me this isn't some evil selfish desire to defy God. I can't exactly defy something that doesn't exist. Help me guys, I can't keep up this farce any longer and when it's done my life will shatter. I'm really on the verge of breaking.",

As a bit of backstory there's a 'mountain' (big hill, more like) nearby that has a logging road up to the top of it.  At the top of the road is a nice viewpoint, some trails, a place for hang gliders to launch from, and - a big ass crucifix.  \n\nThe crucifix fell down a while back and that was all good by me - but it's been put back up.  I'm pretty sure it's on public land but around here it could well be private forest land - I'm not sure.  Either way it's a big cross that stands on a big hill overlooking the local town.\n\nNow this is Canada we're talking about.  Other than the crazy JW lady who sits outside the Royal Bank (and has for the last 22 years) giving out her copies of Watchtower there's not really a lot of religion getting jammed down my throat.  People are pretty much live and let live.  \n\nThis cross overlooking the city offends me - but it's just so very 'non religious' that I just don't see myself taking a stand over it.  I feel like it shouldn't be there but I also know that it's important to some of the locals - it means something to them - and, though I feel strongly it shouldn't be there I also feel like I'd be the douche for making a stink.

Basically you have to construct reality and thereby your beliefs about it within a system that works along side our knowledge of how physics works. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5Fel1VKEN8",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/2suoxy/discussion_about_fairly_or_unfairly_assigning/",
        "text": "I think I've found an analogy that accurately captures our tendency to have a clouded judgement when dealing with more sensitive subjects. When religion appears to be at the center of a violent act, people are quick to defend religion and assign the blame elsewhere (which, to be fair, is sometimes correct). But I do think I have a good analogy to show that we are often blinded by sensitivities when deciding if we should blame religion or not. \n\nFor example: We are perfectly content to recognize football as a cause for head injuries. We can look at the statistics of head injuries for football athletes compared to (for example) tennis athletes and recognize that there is something inherent about football (slamming your head into other people) which is more likely to result in head injuries. \n\nWe **do not**, for example, blame a rivalry between the city of New Orleans and the city of Dallas for head injuries. If someone were to blame head injuries on some kind of feud between cities, people would feel compelled to counter by pointing out that the feud is centered around the game of football, namely the two teams: The Saints and the Cowboys. \n\nWhy then, when we point out that a war is between two or more extremists of religion, is it suddenly taboo or distasteful to point out? I'm not saying religion is 100% the cause of these things, but I think it is naive to say that **none** of the blame should be assigned to religion. \n\nAnd when we recognize that football is more likely to cause head injuries, that doesn't mean we blame the people who play or watch football. We are merely recognizing the fact that football, as a sport, is more prone to this kind of injury. In the same way, when we look at a given religion, the violence/nonviolence of its scriptures, and the statistical correlation of those kinds of events, we can reasonably conclude that a given religion is more/less prone to this sort of behavior, and fairly assign blame. \n\nAnd we can go further. We can look around at other sports and activities and recognize that some of them are more prone to injury/violence than others. We can even conclude that some activities are inherently **not** physically dangerous, such as chess: If someone gets a concussion at a chess tournament, for example, it's more likely than not that their injury has nothing to do with the game of chess. We can do the same thing about religion. E.G. If a Buddhist were to bomb a public place, it almost certainly has nothing to do with the doctrines of Buddhism, whereas the same cannot be said of other religions. \n\nI think the football analogy is very steep in its similarities and **the most significant difference between the scenarios** is our sensitivities, which ultimately clouds peoples' judgement enough to not want to assign blame in the case of religion, but when sensitivities are taken away (in the case of football), we are perfectly happy to assign blame where it is deserved. Your thoughts? \n\n-----------------\n\nEDIT: A comment has led me to another thought drawing out the consequences of sensitivity. No one has any problem accepting that religious doctrine has influenced the cultural norm that many businesses close on Sundays. There's absolutely no quarrel or sensitivity when it comes to accepting this. The same goes for certain statistics, like how a Jewish household is far less likely to have pork in their fridge. Obviously religious doctrine has influence over people and over societies, and people have no problem accepting these examples. But when it comes to violence, then suddenly assigning blame is a completely different process, and religion is expected to be immune to it. ",

That certain events took place surrounding this man, but the first evidence of it came decades after the fact, and we are supposed to accept it as good evidence.\n\nI feel like this is a good analogy, although I may be missing a few things.

The article mentioned that his father is a \"Christian therapist\", so I can't help but think his families beliefs influenced him indirectly, or directly to make the story up.\n\nAdditionally, a child that age doesn't have the resources to initiate a book deal.   Did the parents \"help\" him along with that process.\n\nI understand that there is another child and family that has done the [same thing](http://heavenisforreal.net/), but with 4 books and a movie.

        "text": "It took weeks and weeks of getting the courage up and getting ready. I spent hours working hard to get my argument just right so I feel like telling you the whole story.\n\nHi I'm 16 years old and I think I have been atheist my whole life. It started when I was younger and we went to church, we may have had a bad pastor or I just was to dumb because I asked wayyyyyyyy to many questions. I noticed those questions weren't answered my favorites were:\n\"What if people don't know about god do they go to hell?\"\n\"What if a murderer repents before he dies does he go to hell?\"\n\"Is God a person noun or an idea Noun?\"\n\nThen to throw my apple just a bit farther from my parents tree I love science. Let me make this clear because people get the wrong idea about when an atheist wants to be smart. I DO NOT bash religions or bring up facts or what not in religious arguments all that the science channel was to me was a great way to spend an afternoon and bond with my dad. But it turned into a reason I don't believe. \n\nwhen you turn on the science channel you see concrete evidence facts and opinions/ideas that can be backed up. There is no spiritual searching for something i just couldn't feel without force. I could look up into the sky and say. \"This happens because gravity pull\"or \"E=MC2 because blah blah blah blah\" It all made since and when it did n't they chucked the idea out the window.\n\nThen the infamous bible camp came around. I think I know my parents well enough for them not to try and convert me but this camp took its best swing. There was a 1 hour season of church a day but the schedule as heavenly (huehuehue) compared to that. Paintball, tag, zip lining, hiking, biking, smores, swimming, dodge ball. Even the food was good. but even there \"close to god outdoors\" -Camp counselor. I never felt that elusive faith thing everyone talks about.\nI'd sit by a small river and try and talk to him and feel him. All that I would get were knots in my stomach thinking about that redhead girl from the other side of the camp and a wet but from being to close to the stream. but for a time there i thought i was christian then once I left I realized it was the fun of the camp washing over me not the love of God.\n\nThat basically brings us to today. I spent most of my life in the back of a the church during the sermon or youth group just reading the bible. Trying to find something in the garbled up text that I can relate to and I can feel. \n\nI sat down with my parents and said\n\"I don't want to go and study something I do not believe or follow\"\nThey weren't surprised but I could tell they were shocked. My parents love me and I am lucky though my Mom said something unsettling. \n\"I just don't understand how people like you can live without faith\"\nThen the smart-ass atheist that lives in all of use came out and I said\n\"I don't understand how people like you can live with it\"\nReligion is off the table in my house now. And I'm glad.\n\nNow if I could get them to stop making me say grace\n\nTL;DR: My parents stop making me go to church after a argument and I gave a summary of my movement to real atheism.\n\nEdit: Wow so a lot more people read this then I thought would. Thank you for reading everyone if you enjoyed I'm glad and if not I'm sorry for wasting your time :)",

        "text": "TOP-EDIT: The purpose of this post is not to shout into an echo-chamber, but to ask your advice on my argument below.  I've had a hard time formulating a response to the Charlie Hebdo attack and the subsequent (and ironic) media responses endorsing, tacitly or overtly, limitations of free speech so as not to offend.  As I thought more about free speech and reread the classic texts on the subject, the following occurred to me and I want to see what you all think.  The responses so far have been great, the discussion varied and stimulating.  I hope they continue to be.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI'm willing to grant, as Sam Harris has done several times in the past, that of course all Muslims are not terrorists and that the vast majority would never engage in a terror attack. Inherent violence in the doctrines of Islam is not the point of this post; neither is the point that significant percentages of Muslims in \"western\" countries (the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia) condone terror attacks. It is safe to say, though, that nearly all such condoners feel that attacks like the one on Charlie Hebdo are justified, indeed warranted, because they demand that blasphemy laws should be implemented across the entire population and that religious offense should be punishable. *This view is not limited to that group and we now come to the point of this post.*\n\nDespite the liberal habit of taking political correctness so seriously as to completely ignore the equally liberal and vastly more important right to free speech, nearly all Western democracies still hold sacred the freedom to say whatever the hell you want. The most essential of the Enlightenment ideals, the one necessary for people to form their own opinions rather then being told what to think, free speech is sadly in need of protection from this newly-advanced, though poorly-supported right not to be offended.\n\nThe percentages of Muslims in Western countries who support a punishment of any kind for insulting the prophet are multiple times the number of those that condone terror attacks. Though they may differ on what punishment should be meted out, the fact that large groups, in some cases majorities, of Muslims demand this prosecution shows in stark detail the real problem between Islam and the West: **a segment of people who will denounce and reject what may be the core tenet of these Enlightenment-based societies cannot ever integrate into those societies.**\n\nSometimes freedom of speech can go beyond subtle and nuanced commentary to outright crudeness and base humor. Sometimes it can be designed explicitly to provoke. Reza Aslan, that expert in all things he says he is, suggested that publications that print such cartoons as Charlie Hebdo may often be attempting to provoke an extreme response in order to make a statement about who belongs in European secular culture. In this rare instance, I agree with him and I go so far as to welcome those attempts. A cartoon that is deliberately offensive, racist-in-fact as opposed to critical of religion, ignorant, and/or bigoted may well deserve our opprobrium and disapprobation. It does not deserve a response, criminal or civil, from the state. It does not deserve prior restraint. And it certainly does not vigilante justice. If you are shown the extents of free speech and it offends you to the point of demanding state punishment, you do not belong in Western society.\n\nEdit: Formatting didn't transfer.  Fixed.\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for the comments, everyone.  I'm really enjoying the discussion.  My post on /r/atheism served primarily to draw out a pseudo-intellectual who delighted in logical fallacies.  ",

        "text": "A little background. I wrote a blog post that dealt with the issue of declining church attendance. I only briefly mentioned my atheism to clarify my perspective, but a distant family member happened to stumble across it and decided to use the comments section to attempt to show me the error in my ways. At first I didn't mind the discussion, but it began to grow more tenuous once he started trotting out all the typical apologetic tropes. It's also become abundantly clear that he has no interest in actually engaging with my responses. He has now turned the subject to cosmology. He's essentially employing Kalam masked in a vaguely scientific haze of cherry-picked facts and misrepresentations. I've explained to him that I am not a scientist and that even among PhD cosmologists, there is still so much that we don't/can't know that we probably shouldn't be drawing conclusions about  the nature of existence from our hunches. Nonetheless, he insists,\n\n\"The law of conservation of mass says that in nature mass is neither created nor destroyed. So nature cannot be the reason for existence of matter. You could posit that the ball of matter just was always there it is eternal thus not violating the law of conservation of mass. However this is has an issue when it comes to why did the ball of matter explode? You could say as the matter giggled around inside itself something sparked it. However with an eternal ball of matter you can always posit the universe would have exploded sooner than now. In fact this creates an utter paradox. So the eternal ball of matter theory fails.\nAnd yet matter does exist and the law of conservation of mass says that nature cannot be cause. In my mind it is madness to simply stop here. Through [sic] up your hands and say someone will figure out a way for nature to be the cause. \"\n\nAs I've said, I am not a scientist, but he basically holds the position that until I can explain exactly what happened naturally, God is the winner by default. I've attempted to explain why this is a fallacy to him, but he's not having any of it. Is there anyone who would be willing to explain in layman's terms why God isn't necessary for the universe to exist?\n\nedit grammar. \n\nedit 2: Thanks everyone for your thoughtful and informed responses and sub-dialogues. As I suspected, this is taking me down a road with more questions than answers. I told him from the start that I am nowhere near qualified to answer or even speculate about these questions; your comments have helped to show that this is even more true than I thought. A lot of people are linking me to Krauss' video. I had actually seen it before, but I don't think any theist would ever be satisfied with his definition of \"nothing\". If anything, I now see what a fool's errand these conversations really are. Thanks again. ",

        "text": "I'm reading a book by Shermer called The Science of Good and Evil because I'm interested in exploring the ideas of Harris and Shermer and others on their ideas of free will, or lack of.  \n\nRight off the bat, Shermer starts making claims about morality that shocked me, and made me wonder how he can make claims such as these and still consider himself a rational critical thinker who relies on reason, not religion, to support his perspective.\n\nOn page 15 he quotes Darwin and Dawkins and then claims we \"equate evolution with ethical nihlism and moral degeneration.   He asks, \"If we are nothing more than the product of sightless natural forces, operating within a mercilessly uncaring cosmos, from whence can we find absolute ethical standards or ultimate moral meaning?  \n\nI think that question is a silly one, needed by someone who needs to have faith in an imaginary friend or force.  Of course we are nothing more than the product of \"sightless natural forces, operating within a mercilessly uncaring cosmos.  There are no \"absolute ethical standards\" or \"ultimate moral meaning\" to find.\n\nOur ethical standards are not absolute.  Nothing is absolute.   We do have personal ethical standards that allow us to keep our conduct within boundaries we believe we can live with, and community ethical standards that we must comply with if we want to remain an accepted member of our community, but  there are no absolute ethical standards.  \n\nThere is no ultimate moral meaning!  We must all find our own meaning in the cosmos, and develop our own morals.  \n\nHe goes on to answer the question by quoting Darwin, \"When I view all things not as special creations, but as lineal descendants of some few beings which lived long before the first bed of the Cambrian system was deposited, they seem to be to be ennobled.\"   \n\nThat is not an answer to the question, btw, but putting that aside, he goes on to ask what is ennobling about evolution and how can we construct a transcendent morality out of evolutionary ethics?  Skipping the first question (he also skips it, btw) and focusing on the second, we cannot construct anything that is transcendent.  Further, how are you now trying to construct something that before you claimed was absolute?  First it's something absolute, that we must find, now, even on the same page, it's something we're going to construct? This lack of consistency in approaching the problem bothers me, and makes me wonder if he's about to pull the same kind of logical acrobatics that christians are so good at when trying to convince you that some bit of B.S. is gospel.\n\nHe continues his thought on the next page (page 16), quoting Plato telling a story about Socrates he makes the point that people have always required connecting God or gods to morality in order for it to be \"absolute, eternal, and meaningful.\"\n\nWhere I think Shermer is going wrong on this point, is by not recognizing the problem isn't with god, it's with the words absolute and eternal.  You can remove god from statement above and it's still built on a false premise, that there is or can be a truth, or a moral principle that is absolute or eternal.   \n\nI would love any thoughts or discussion anyone cares to share with me on this subject.  Why is it so many atheists find it necessary to link our morality to some concept that is absolute and eternal in order to feel like it's a legitimate alternative to morality based on a religious code or text?  Why can't we just acknowledge our morality, while not absolute, is as good, as accurate, as relevant, as helpful to us and our communities, maybe more so, than the religious alternatives, only ours is better because it's not propped up by religious claims of \"absolute\" or \"eternal\".\n\nI don't think god is where religious people make the wrong turn, god is one of the many problems that result from the wrong turn.  The error is the belief that we are right because our side is absolute, or eternal, and the sense of certainty that embracing the concepts of \"absolute\" and \"eternal\" leads to.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\n\n\n\n",

Humans tend to be a species that loves tradition and patterns, and this seems to be something that religion has provided for very well.  Religion provides a structure for traditions ranging from daily, weekly, monthly yearly and everything in between birth to death.  And there are a lot of secular traditions as well, but whereas religion seems to have codified these traditions in various forms and fashions, there does not seem to be anything I can find that is like an index of secular traditions.  For example, a book that lists common birthday traditions, end of the year traditions, mid summer traditions, what one does when getting married, funerary traditions, that sort of thing.  So does anybody know of any books that exist that catalogs and describes secular traditions throughout the world? ",

Sorry for the clickbait-y title, I guess.)\n\n(EDIT 2: I get it. \"Oppressed\" is the wrong way to describe it. My exact wording isn't the point here.)\n\n\nI mean, it's nothing major; there were no real-world consequences, and I've still got my Privelege^TM intact, so to speak.\n\n[This article](http://www.thepoliticalinsider.com/horrible-army-captain-save-lives-atheists-furious/) was making the rounds on Facebook, and I decided to check it out. It's short enough to read quickly, but if you don't feel like it, then a tl;dr is that an army chaplain was publicly attacked (not literally. Like in a shame/accusatory kind of way) by a radical atheist group for mentioning his personal experiences with depression, which happened to involve Christianity, on a pamphlet in a mandatory suicide prevention class. \n\nI thought to myself that, based on context, it really didn't seem like the chaplain did anything wrong. Did he violate army protocol? Maybe, but I don't know enough about military rules to dispute that. I found a couple other articles on the matter ([1](http://www.armytimes.com/story/military/2014/12/10/army-chaplain-joseph-lawhorn-ranger-training-complaint/20213399/), [2+pictures of the handout](http://dailysignal.com/2014/12/14/military-punishes-chaplain-for-referencing-bible-during-suicide-prevention-seminar/), [3+his response](http://dailysignal.com/2014/12/18/punished-referencing-bible-military-chaplain-tells-side-story/)), since that one seemed to have more bias and less information than I would have liked, and I'm still convinced that he's in the right. I personally feel like there's wisdom that can be gained from any ideology, and that if it worked for him, then maybe there's something to get out it.\n\nI read the article's Facebook comments, and was instantly disgusted by what I saw. About half of them were harmless pro-chaplain comments, but the other half was pure vitriol. Comments included language like (and these are exact quotations, not exaggerated):\n\n&gt; \"Who cares what atheists think anyway! I don't!...\"\n\n&gt; \"Atheists can go to hell with their comments and fury!!\" I say live and let live. ...\"\n\n&gt; \"Atheists get over yourselves! Guess what I will be praying for YOU and you cannot do anything about it! Put that in your hat and smoke it! Sick of this stuff. I AM OFFENDED!!!!!!!!!\"\n\n&gt; \"It's time we took back America and the military. Atheist and Muslims stand aside.\"\n\n&gt; \"To Hell With Atheists ...\"\n\n&gt; \"Too bad for atheists. Jesus is the Way the Truth and the Light. Amen\"\n\n&gt; \"Atheists sure fear God...\"\n\n&gt; \"... the religion the constitution was founded on...\"\n\n&gt; \"...war on christianity...\"\n\nI keep scrolling, and nearly all the comments are like this. Passive-aggressive \"We'll pray for them\"s, etc. The only ones that aren't are, as I mentioned, merely neutral.\n\nI'm not exactly about to subject myself to the rest of the 3000+ comments, so here's one more:\n\n&gt; TO ALL ATHEISTS:\n\n&gt;Why fight so hard against something you don't believe in? Answer: Because in your heart you know God is real and one day you will have to face him and you don't want to face the people here on earth that really can help you find him before it is to late. But it's ok that you hate us we all still love you just as God tells us to and we forgive you for all that you have done and said. It may hurt and be hard at to take at times but if we want to be like God and stand beside one day them we as Christians must learn that we must let your words wash off of us and move on because he has bigger plans for all of us. And if we really believe then NOTHING can stop us from praying or reading our bibles or telling others about the word of God. No matter how hard anyone try's. NO ONE CAN TAKE THAT FROM A TRUE CHRISTIAN!!!!! In my house I have 5 bibles , have you ever opened one? Maybe you should try it. You may find something you didn't know.\"\n\nI know these people don't represent all Christians - let me just establish that straight away. That being said, I haven't seen such a high concentration of religious-based Internet hatred, ignorance, and intolerance since the last time I stepped foot into [the mothership](/r/atheism) itself. Reading the comments, I felt genuinely hurt a little bit. It literally made me feel sick to my stomach. I didn't do anything wrong. I'm not oppressing anyone. I don't deserve to go to Hell just because of what I believe. This radical group does not speak for me. I thought to myself, \"Is this what a religious person stumbling into /r/atheism might feel like? Is this the kind of thing the average American Muslim might go through every single day after some radical Islamic group performs a terrorist act somewhere?\" It's the *they*s, *them*s, and *those*es that really get me. I'm the reddit trifecta: white, straight, and male. That is to say I can't say I've ever had to deal with something like this before. I don't like it.\n\nI was raised Catholic, have been Catholic for most of life, and have gone to Catholic school for K-12 (which has always included religion class). I got Confirmed in the Catholic church, and have many religious friends and relatives. I feel I'm justified in saying that I have a firm grasp of a good amount of the theology and teachings. I know Christianity, and that isn't it.\n\nOn the bright side, at least I can say I've experienced something new.\n\n&gt;\"But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will be liable to the hell of fire.\" \n\n(Matthew 5:22)\n",

I hate that.\n\nWhat I'd like to discuss - with all due respect to those who were killed and their families/friends that are left behind - is whether something good may come out of this horrific tragedy.\n\nThe dangers of religion are well known to our community of atheists/secularists.  We've had a battle convincing the religious and their puppets in government of the dangers religion poses - despite the clear signs we see every day in the news.  \n\nBut many of the atrocities we've been watching are 'far away' relatively speaking.  In Africa, Indonesia, Malaysia, East Timor, or the Middle East.  Somehow they haven't seemed to touch us all the way an attack like this in a country like France has.\n\nCould this help bring the issue of the dangers of religion more to the fore and, perhaps, push us (politicians, leaders of all sorts) to put the issue of religious violence higher up on their list of priorities?\n\nI sincerely hope so.

It doesn't scare me, and am comforted by the thought of fading into nothingness. \n\nI love talking to my residents, but religion is one topic I shy away from with them.  A lot of these people were raised in a different time, and I would not want to upset or offend anyone with my beliefs. I know the circumstances are different since he is asking for opinions, and I am willing to discuss anything he wants honestly. \n\nI can be pretty socially awkward, and all I really want to do is share my thoughts in an authentic way that provides a sense of comfort. His family is active in his care, and I take it are rather religious, since they are usually accompanied by the chaplain. I don't want to step on their toes either. \n\nI appreciate any words of wisdom-profound out otherwise. My mother was diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia today, and I aim to treat this guy as well as if it was my own parent. Thank you!\n\nWow, sorry for the wall of text. \nTL:DR, Chatty hospice patient likes to talk about religion. How can I express my views without scaring or upsetting him?",

For instance, they state that the punishment for apostasy is simply fitting with the context of the time, and the people who would apply it in today's world are misguided. I believe the argument is something along the lines of apostasy would be comparable to treason today which in certain cases is punishable in the western world by capital punishment (which I am opposed to but thats a different matter). Is there any historical context to truly suggest these contexts? Or is it just a PR move on the side of the scholars of each faith ever time a certain piece of scripture doesn't fit with the values of the modern world? And also, how do atheists combat these arguments?\n\nFor the record I do identify myself as atheist, but this question is more academic in nature rather than just trying to bash religion.\n\n",

My family all knows this, and they have learned not to try to convert me or they'll get an onslaught of uncomfortable questions and often smartass rebuttals. Parents have been divorced for 15 years, and my father's mother has played a very important role in my life. They all devote their life to their respective churches.\n\nWe've all had great relationships. However, recently my father has gotten onto Facebook (my fault.. He's going through a divorce and I thought it would be a good way for him to socialize) and he's discovered some kind of radical pages I didn't even think existed. One is called JewsNews and all of his posts are getting more and more extreme. He's basically joined a virtual cult, as it's all he can talk about and he recently deleted me from Facebook for my opposing views. \n\nThis has been going on for a while but the real problem is that he has always been irresponsible and now he isn't paying his bills and he's fasting because there are people on Facebook confirming he is a prophet of God. He wants to sell a 205,000 house for 70,000 because money doesn't matter and there are more important things than paying your bills on time. It's difficult to discuss this with other family members because they can't say that he isn't talking to God. And I'm here freaking out, because he's completely failing to prepare for retirement or even to take care of himself and my two youngest sisters (4 and 1) because he's literally snapped.\n\nEDIT: Step Mother divorced my father about a year ago. She took a lot of the money they were supposed to be saving together (during their 5 years together) and put it in a separate account. My youngest sisters will be taken care of. My father has been fighting for visitation rights which may be a contributing factor to his mental break.",

        "text": "I am a secular humanist atheist. I vehemently despise fundamental religiosity of any one religion (with Christianity and Islam being the main culprits since they tend to be the most active). As for religion in general, I can not wait until it dies out and we have one less thing to fight about as humans (but won't erase wars and fighting altogether since I believe it's primarily profit-driven) and a little more freedom for the advancement of the human species. \n\nNow, right off the bat I could in a sense be labeled a bigot since I refuse to accept an idea (that of intolerance, and worse yet, intolerance coupled with violence). But essentially what I did is post two status updates: one with this cartoon http://i.imgur.com/yy9vg6P.jpg and the caption \"No cartoon is worth killing over\" and then another with this cartoon http://imgur.com/slvcf9e with the caption \"It's an original, but certain people would wish death upon me for this. Bullshit superstition should be rotting away.\" I guess the latter would be the more guilty culprit since it was brought to my attention that the second photo was created by a racist anti-immigrant individual. What made me post this question is that it was my own atheist sister who brought it up. This made me feel like a right-wing lunatic, and I take her opinions to heart. I previously made a FB post criticizing the outrage directed at the Rosetta Project Scientist for his shirt, and she expressed outrage over not understanding how that propagates some sort of patriarchal ruling in the science field that is intimidating to women. I would consider myself an egalitarian and recognize that, even though conditions are improving, women are still at a disadvantage financially and economically. I brought that up since it could be clear that she could be considered a social justice warrior but I really try not to think about labels and just consider her arguments (the merits of which I haven't assessed greatly since I'm not much of a debater and sometimes am too busy to think about). \n\nHer outrage now comes due to the fact that because I used this particular cartoon created by a loathsome individual, starting with her saying \"You know, in Europe, cartoons like that only reinforce their racism against perfectly sane muslims..It's wrong to kill over it, obviously, but those cartoons really aren't okay.\" I then say that I only intended to use it as a point that there exists certain people in this world who would divorce themselves from humanity and try to kill me over it, and that's plain wrong. She then goes on to reiterate that it only reinforces their racism and bigotry against the Muslim minority in Europe, and that white Christian immigrants don't get criticized for their god when their god is also a terrible being. I agree to the second part that the Christian god is terrible, and I won't hesitate to criticize that idea or any inhuman practices committed in this god's name. But just because there exists more racists against those who are more different than other immigrants (and themselves), I don't see a reason why their beliefs shouldn't be open to mocking and ridicule if they're that barbaric. I guess I should've put up an image with all the religious figures in a cartoon-ish manner to be equal opportunity mocker, but it was a heat of the moment type of thing considering Muslim extremists had recently committed the more heinous act. It could very well be that she just has a problem with that particular image, but sooner or later, I'm going to talk to her again about this issue and I want to understand why I was wrong or not wrong. \n\nIs there really an element of racism with respect to that cartoon (if there is, I didn't mean there to be)? How can I better let her know that I don't think it's racist to criticize in this manner (if it is, tell me why I'm wrong)? Am I a bigot in every bad sense of the word for my posts? Being Latino, I see this as no different than criticizing the narco-corrido culture: glorifying the cartel life and propagating violence against others without regard to the innocent through songs (they would similarly kill me for mocking this \"cultural\" lifestyle). It's a significant part of Mexico now, but I don't think criticizing and despising it makes me racist against my own people. ",

Just don't call it marriage. It is defined by law as one man and one woman for pro creation.\" I once held similar views until my de-conversion but I was still taken aback. Traditional marriage is defined in many different formats: slaves wed, arranged marriages via fathers, rapists and their victims, multiple wives, military personnel and their \"conquests\", etc. it is somewhat relative on how marriage is defined based on the current societies laws. Just because we once defined something in law one way does not mean it is not subject to deletion or even alteration. Slavery was perfectly legal a few hundred years ago in America and now we have laws opposite those views because we see the moral ineptitude of these \"traditional\" values. The only real reason for any resistance to the change of the way we define and view marriage is because ideological and biased beliefs, no actual facts of harm to civilisation because of these amendments.

        "text": "So here's a brief rundown of the issue. \n\nMy dad was an alcoholic for many years and it led to my parents' divorce. After the divorce, my dad found God and was able to conquer his alcoholism. I was about 10 years old at the time and had never been to church. My dad introduced me to Christianity and made me go to church, to my reluctance. I don't think I was at an impressionable age at that point. He also started dating a very devout Christian woman and eventually married her. My dad and stepmom remained a very big part of my life, and so did religion (again, to my reluctance). I should also mention that I was living with my mother, who is not religious.\n\nI started to feel more aligned with Atheism around age 16 and kept this a secret from my dad and stepmom out of fear that they would hate me. I've been maintaining that ruse for about 6 years now (I'm 22). I've resolved to not tell them I'm an Atheist, mostly because it would cause a lot of familial strife and I don't want to disappoint them. Since then, I've also developed a drinking problem. I drink to internalize and grieve over certain life issues, and to forget about others. But one issue that always seems to lead me to the bottle is the conflict between my Atheism and my folks' devout Christianity. \n\nI still don't know if I want to tell my dad and stepmom about my Atheism but the notion is certainly not off the table. I suppose counseling could help me with that issue, but I really want to curb my drinking problem. Of course, Alcoholics Anonymous is the first thing that comes to mind, but I'm well aware of their mantra. I'm not too fond of the idea of relinquishing my responsibility for my own actions and submitting to a higher power. I know there's still a good feeling of community with AA and that's appealing, but I don't want to be disingenuous in going to AA and pretending to believe in God.\n\nThere have been some posts before in this sub about this topic, but I'm looking for some fresh advice from people who do and don't have personal experience. How efficacious would AA be for an Atheist? How reputable are programs like SMART Recovery?\n\nEdit: Wow, I'm surprised with the responses! Thank you so much for the heartfelt advice, guys. I wasn't sure if I should've posted in this particular subreddit but you've all given me so much help already, and I'm grateful. I didn't know about /r/stopdrinking but I'm glad some of you mentioned it. It seems like a great sub.\n\nI just want to clarify that it's not specifically my Atheism causing the drinking, but the emotional struggle I've been internalizing and the guilt I feel for not telling my folks the truth, my fear of them, and my lack of courage towards the matter. Of course that's just one of multiple life issues that I'm sure also contribute to my problem.",

As someone who was once a devout Christian, I know that Christian-me had a totally different outlook on life and wouldn't understand atheist-me's view of the world. \n\nSo since, from my point of view, the likelihood of there being a heaven or hell is crazy and virtually zero, I figure that the best way to respond to a question like this is to ask the religious person if they're worried about something that will almost certainly never happen. In this case, just ask the person if they're afraid that they're going to lose the Los Angeles Lakers next weekend. When they say they don't know what you're talking about, just say \"well aren't you worried that you're wrong? What if you're wrong and tomorrow the Spurs are going to sign you to a 5-year deal and start you at point guard against the Lakers? Haven't you thought about that!?\"\n\nThey'll look at you like you're crazy, but that's when you can explain that it would be crazy for them to seriously think about the consequences of something (such as them having to play the Lakers next week) that is never going to happen. In the same way, that's the way that Atheists see the possibility of them being wrong and going to hell: it's something that's so absurd and out of the realm of possibilities that it isn't worth our time and worry. \n\nAnyways, I was trying to think of ways to help bridge the huge gap in the worldview of a Christian and an Atheist when it came to that issue, and this is what I came up with.

        "text": "Recently, I started having doubts about the purely materialist narrative about the world that was previously so natural to me. As many other atheists, I used to see no substantive point in subjective feelings, emotions, and irrationality. This, looking now back, extended into a distrust of culture in general. Rationality and materialism was the way to go for me, and efficiency of living would take precedence over what I saw as base modes of illusory happiness.\n\nToday, I am still an atheist. I don't believe any religion is true, I don't believe in the duality of the soul, I try to see religion in any way it comes. However, I realised that pure materialism was not making me happy. That it doesn't make anybody happy. Coupled with my growing disdain for the postmodernist rejection of all things cultural, I've come to admire great works of art far more intensively, and to praise skilled workmen not for the products of their toil only but for the love they put into their work.\n\nI realised that a civilisation, religious or not, must respect and glorify great cultural artefacts, from vases to churches, not only so that they may be looked at, but so that new cultural wonders may be built in the present time. A bridge should be built in such as way as to not only provide a crossing, but also to serve as a source of happiness for the workers who built it, and awe for the people who see it's beauty. In the same breath, this very civilisation must value itself not only economically but also spiritually. Apart from looking at ways of becoming richer, more effective, faster, or stronger, we should also seek emotional satisfaction in listening to stories which make us happy or sad, in making new friends, in going for walks in the silence of the forests. \n\nNow, none of these things really contribute to our materialist wellbeing (unless we kill the whole point with some brash point about how we need happiness hormones to stimulate our brain). That is why I can only conclude that a healthy society is not one based solely on strict rationalism and a drive towards materialist comfort (though these are important), but also towards some kind of satisfaction with life. \n\nAfter a conversation with several friends of mine I know for a fact that I am not the only one in holding this position, but I am interested in what you think. Thanks!\n\nP.S. My opinion on this matter began evolving most noticeably after I read Arthur Koestler's The Gladiators, I do recommend it to everyone.",

Wasn't revolutionizing Judaism a lost cause anyway or was it a stepping stone to atheism?**\n\n\n\n\nIn switching from Christianity to philosophy, you are far closer to Jesus than if you had stayed a Christian.\nJesus overturned everything too. Jesus walked away from the Old Testament.\nJesus rejected Judaism. Jesus accepted life after death, heaven and hell. Because in the Old Testament if you die, you stay dead.\n\nJesus walked away from a staggering amount of ancient theology. And in walking the path of Jesus you actually can't really stay a Christian, because Jesus reinvented, opposed, overturned.\nHe said: *\"I'm here to set father against son, child against parent, everyone against everyone. I did not come to bring peace. I came to bring a sword.\"*\n\nJesus is an emblem of asserting one's own conscience in the face of overbearing and ancient theology.\nIf you accept Christianity without an examination of your own conscience, it seems you almost couldn't be further away from where Jesus came from.\n\nRevolution should be continual. Like everyone who stages a coup, immediately wishes to prevent anyone else from staging a coup. That's inevitable that's natural.\nJesus staged just about the biggest coup that can be imagined. Because his revolution was not an alteration of mere political power.\n\nHis was the extension of human life to eternity. No bigger a revolution you could argue really in history.\nYou are walking the path of Jesus far more closely by thinking for yourself, examining your own conscience, being willing to overturn theological history. You're walking the path of Jesus far more closely than if you showed up in your best suit on Sunday and put twenty bucks in the collection plate.\nYou're closer to that which you worshiped now, I believe, then if you continued to do all of the rote stuff that Jesus really overturned in his day.\n\n\nIf you wish to really understand I think what Jesus went through all you have to do is start thinking for yourself.\nChrist had a personal relationship with a deity, that I obviously don't believe exists, but you have a personal relationship with philosophy.\nPhilosophy is something that we impose upon ourselves, but also something which is imposed upon us through the body, through the senses, through the empiricism of that which is real.\n\n**This text is based on a three minute video with Stefan Molyneux http://youtu.be/aut7Og-uDbU, which is based on a 65 minute video http://youtu.be/ZP-9RjvXt1A?t=9m51s **\n\nThis is not just a quote from a video (see information below), I first transcribed the video and then changed it slightly.\n\n",
