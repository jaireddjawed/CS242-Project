Then we share answers, that why it would be easier to finish, however I asked another friend to do the same. so I did no work and two friends did it for me. I acted like I was giving each friend my own answers but I was just giving them each other answers. to make sure they didn’t communicate and not catch on that I was using them both, i instigated them both to the point they blocked each other. I would encourage each friend that the other one was bad and tell lies about them. In my final year I did no work at all and got an average of 96% people say the final year highschool was stressful but for me it was the easiest. I do feel bad taking advantage of my friends tho",

        "text": "When I was in highschool (about 15/16 yo) I had a teacher that would constantly pick on me. I got many detentions, trips to the office and calls home because of her. She was the only teacher I ever had problems with. I come from a very strict household where physical punishment was present (not abuse my parents came from a different time). Meaning I got in trouble a lot because of this lady. \n\nOne time she claimed I was being disrespectful and embarrassed her in front of the class. My father did not take this well and I got my butt whooped in front of the entire class. It was so bad my principal even said he would’ve dealt with it in house had he known my situation. Meanwhile the teacher just used this as ammo and after that her response was always “don’t make me have to call your father”. \n\nMy school is central in our area meaning many after school extracurriculars meet on our campus. I wanted to get out some frustration and piss a few people off and so I went in the bathrooms when no one was in them took a permanent marker and drew big dicks on everything. Bathroom stalls, showers, doors, walls anything that had space, there was a giant dick on it. \n\nHonestly I just thought my principal would be pissed and they would just wash it off but turns out that marker was more permanent than I thought. It wouldn’t wash off (the walls were tile and so were the showers) and no matter how much paint they used you could always see it peaking through underneath. \n\nThe school ended up having to retile the entire bathroom, change the doors, redo the bathroom stalls and everything in between. Honestly I don’t even actually know how much it cost but to completely renovate 4 bathrooms with about 4 showers and 6-8 stalls per bathroom. I know that it cost a pretty penny. The best part about it was that they couldn’t prove it was a student from our school so no one ever got in trouble for it and I never got caught.",

        "text": "When I was in highschool (about 15/16 yo) I had a teacher that would constantly pick on me. I got many detentions, trips to the office and calls home because of her. She was the only teacher I ever had problems with. I come from a very strict household where physical punishment was present (not abuse my parents came from a different time). Meaning I got in trouble a lot because of this lady. \n\nOne time she claimed I was being disrespectful and embarrassed her in front of the class. My father did not take this well and I got my butt whooped in front of the entire class. It was so bad my principal even said he would’ve dealt with it in house had he known my situation. Meanwhile the teacher just used this as ammo and after that her response was always “don’t make me have to call your father”. \n\nMy school is central in our area meaning many after school extracurriculars meet on our campus. I wanted to get out some frustration and piss a few people off and so I went in the bathrooms when no one was in them took a permanent marker and drew big dicks on everything. Bathroom stalls, showers, doors, walls anything that had space, there was a giant dick on it. \n\nHonestly I just thought my principal would be pissed and they would just wash it off but turns out that marker was more permanent than I thought. It wouldn’t wash off (the walls were tile and so were the showers) and no matter how much paint they used you could always see it peaking through underneath. \n\nThe school ended up having to retile the entire bathroom, change the doors, redo the bathroom stalls and everything in between. Honestly I don’t even actually know how much it cost but to completely renovate 4 bathrooms with about 4 showers and 6-8 stalls per bathroom. I know that it cost a pretty penny. The best part about it was that they couldn’t prove it was a student from our school so no one ever got in trouble for it and I never got caught.",

        "text": "Over a year ago I decided to spend my winter break walking part of the Appalachian trail. I told my parents I was staying at school to work over break and they were fine with it because they liked me working to save up money. I also didn’t tell anyone else that I was doing this. I simply packed my things in my car and left. \n\nI was going through a lot at the time. I had just recently gone through a break up, I was incredibly worried about my dad who is battling cancer, and I was going through some career path bumps in college. I was just really stressed all the time and I wanted to find some solace in solitude in nature. And doing so in the winter was the perfect time because no one was out in the mountains. \n\nI was out there for about a month and I hopped between places with my car. I didn’t want to be too far away from my car because of the weather conditions and the fact that I was alone without a weapon other than a pocketknife. But I did spend several days camping and hiking at each location to be faithful to the adventure. \n\nIt was incredibly peaceful when I was out there. The snow was absolutely beautiful, especially in the morning when it started to drip when the sun rose. Even in the winter, there was still a decent amount of wildlife that I spotted such as some deer and birds. There was no one out there and I felt like I could appreciate nature in its natural form. I would always get annoyed at National parks with the massive amount of people there.\n\nBut that’s what made it incredibly terrifying too. There was no one out there. No one to help me if I was in trouble. And if I did stumble across someone, I’d be in danger if that had some bad intentions. Besides from people, the wildlife scared me as well, especially at night. I remember the first night, I was struggling to start a fire because the wood I collected was damp and I was getting frustrated. When I heard screaming echo throughout the valley. I was absolutely terrified and hid in my tent with the lantern off. In hindsight, it was probably a bobcat or fox but I’ve seen videos of cougars screaming. Even though cougars have thought to have gone extinct in Appalachia, I’ve heard that there are still remnants of them deep in the mountains.\n\nOverall the trip was amazing. I wish I had more time to be out there and maybe next time I’ll bring friends.",

        "text": " I was let go from my last job back in December as a 1st line IT technician. I had changed the password employee of a customer who has regularly called but because I hadn't confirmed with manager of the company if it was really the employee calling, my manager advised that this was a data breach and they failed my probation. I haven't told anyone besides my partner about this as I feel like I would have received backlash from family members and comments made. \n\nI got a new job working as a junior DC tech almost straight away with a pay-rise of over £4500 a year but I have constant anxiety that It's going to happen again and they're going to get rid of me. I am putting in the hours, overtime and working as hard as I can. I have been doing the job for 2 months now and I am really enjoying it, but I am scared I'm not learning and progressing as fast as they would like me too as I keep making little mistakes. I am just terrified that I'm going to let this job slip away and ruin my future and be left with nothing.\n\nIf there are any data center technicians out there that can offer up any advise and future learning so I can ace this and get better than please reach out.",
