        "text": "About a month ago I was at work, doing what I normally do at work, fix and sell bicycles. This moment has been on my mind all month, as I just can't wrap my head around it. It seems so simple and could easily be shrugged off as a coincidence and just \"weird.\" This day just so happened to be my birthday, and I was supposed to leave at 4pm. Well 5pm rolls around, as this was a busy week for us, and I couldn't leave my post. Well I was making small talk with a customer, and to keep it brief the conversation went something like this:\n\n\"Hi there, how can I help you today?\"\n\n\"Oh my bike is messed up blah blah\"\n\n\"We can probably fix it by \\[two days from then\\], I've already been here an extra hour and I need to leave soon\"\n\n\"What's the hurry? It probably won't take that long\"\n\n\"It's my birthday and I have a family bbq I need to get to and we're pretty backed up on repairs as it is\"\n\n\"Oh, happy 25th!\"\n\nNow I've never met this person in my entire life. I have no connection to them in any way.\n\n\"Thanks! Wait, how did you know I'm 25?\"\n\nThey could not give me a straight answer. Some people might say something like, \"oh you just look 25\" or something. This person simply could not tell me why they said that. They even paused and thought about it for a moment.\n\n\"This is weird I would never assume someone's age to their face, if I guessed wrong that could be offensive or something.\"\n\nThey just blurted it out for no reason at all, but they were so certain of it, they said it as if they had known me their whole life. No one has ever guessed my age properly before. Not a lot of people have guessed, but they have all been wrong by at least a couple years. I definitely look younger than 25.\n\nIt's not ground-shattering, but it still gives me the creeps. Small but extremely specific \"coincidences\" like this always make me uneasy.",

        "text": "I live in Australia, on the east coast and we use Australian Eastern Standard Daylight Time (AEDST). On the night of September 11, 2001 I was enjoying watching the Bob Dylan documentary from 1967, 'Don't Look Back' on ABC TV Australia. \n\nAt that time it must have been about 11.00 pm because the documentary hadn't been on for long. This made the time in New York city just then about 9.00 am. (The first plane having hit at 8.46 am.) \n\nA shockingly worded message suddenly came across the top of the TV screen, telling me of a disaster occurring right now in New York city where two planes had crashed into both of the twin towers.\n\nImmediately, I thought to myself, 'Wow, one plane crashing into the towers might be just an accident, but two? No way! This can't be anything other than a deliberate attack!'\n\nThe Dylan documentary quickly disappeared and a live broadcast of a scene of the twin towers came on screen, however, I was surprised to see there was only one plane set smouldering, embedded in just one of the two towers, and not two as just reported a minute or so earlier. I thought maybe the news must have made a mistake, since it had only just happened and sometimes news reports are a little blurry when they first report details of an event.\n\nI watched this surreal scene in a state of growing shock and about two minutes later a second plane came into view and slammed into the side of the other tower. \n\nSoon my best friend rang me, starting off the conversation with the words, \"Are you watching this..?\" Most of our conversation from then on was just silences and expletives peppered with the occasional 'I can't believe this!' as we watched for the next hour or so and the whole awful series of events took place.\n\nAt the time, I didn't really think too much about the odd discrepancy in the reporting of the fact that two planes had struck, even though when they began broadcasting what I assumed was live footage of events as they unfolded, there appeared to only be one crashed plane and the other one crashing didn't happen until after the transmission had begun.\n\nI've done some research and a live broadcast from NY to Australia today in 2018 has only a seven second delay and I don't understand why there would have been any more delay than that back in 2001, since live satellite broadcasts were common place back then. \n\nIf that was a live broadcast of events as they happened with no delay present, I really can't explain why there seemed to be this foreknowledge of the event of the second plane crashing on the part of the ABC TV Australia news reporting services and so, the whole thing as it unfolded back then today looks more and more very much like a major glitch in the matrix.\n\nI wonder what could have caused the news of the twin towers seem to report the second plane crashing before it actually happened?\n\nTLDR: In Australia, news of the twin towers seemed to report the second plane crashing before it actually happened.\n\nEdit: removed extraneous information for clarity and to fix grammatical errors.",

I am maybe 5 years old at the time and my middle sister is 9. It's just my parents, my two sisters, and I in the house. We all go to bed where we fall asleep in separate rooms each, except my parents. Maybe halfway throughout the night, I'm rolling over in bed when something prompts me to wake up; something felt off. I wake up in my sister's bed by myself, but I didn't think much of it? Maybe I thought I was dreaming; point is I was in the middle of sleep so I knocked back out quickly. Morning comes by when I wake up still in my sisters bed. I get up and walk to my room where I find my sister sleeping in my bed. I wake her up and her immediate reaction is confusion. We asked our parents if anything happened and if they switched us up for some reason. They tell us they didn't do a single thing. My sister and I only have recollection of ourselves kind of realizing we are in different beds in the middle of the night but thats it. Nothing else. We still bring it up in conversation every once in a while.\n\nWe've told this story to multiple people but no one can get any idea as to why that would happen. This was 20 years ago.\n\nEdit: Forgot to add that we've asked our parents about this in our adult lives and they still deny having any involvement in what happened",

        "text": "Many years ago my friend bought a house in a terrible neighborhood for a great price.  It was used mainly as a crash pad for a bunch of us in different bands around town.  After a few thefts everything always stayed locked down, doors double locked gates with locks etc.  This particular night there were only 4 of us here.  The owner, a friend staying on the couch in the living room and two of us in the back room.  My bed was right next to the hallway that lead from the living room through our room to the backyard.  1 way in.  My friend was a heavy smoker but he was also a heavy sleeper.  \n\nThis night it was around 2 or 3 am and I hear him get up from the couch and start walking down the hallway towards our back room.  As he walks just around my bed (I'm a super light sleeper, and was already awake from hearing him get up) he stops and stares straight forward wearing only boxers and a shirt..I ask him \"Hey Jon, you going to have a smoke?\" he slowly turns his head and looks straight at me, says nothing and just stares at me then walks away, opens the backdoor to walk out..I thought that was strange considering he's a loud mouth turd who talks at every moment, middle of the night not excluded.\n\nAbout 15min go by with the door still wide open I decide to go smoke a joint outside while he's ciggin, I walk out to the smoke spot and he's not there, I start looking around for him and don't find him.  I actually start to freak out to myself a little check the gate, still locked.  I then go inside and just do a duhh check and sure enough he's on the couch..still asleep glasses on the table, front door still double locked.  \n\nThis house was absolutely creepy as shit though if I'm being honest, there were so many strange things that happened nobody would believe except the people who experienced it.  Two people were murdered in that house years previous we found out from the neighbors.  It also mirrors my house I bought a few years later as well, I found out after moving out a woman was murdered in my master bedroom which I'll expand on in other appropriate subreddits.\n\nhere's a shit diagram of the layout\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/tReVlBJ.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/tReVlBJ.jpg)",

As I stood I was playing with my cat, pointing a laser at the ground without looking sending it down the hall. The cat quickly chasing it. My mother in the kitchen to left. My brother in the room behind me to the right of the hall. There I stood doing that for what felt like an hour. But at some point I realized I don't hear any thing. I slipped back into full dream, it no long was in my senses to feel anything outside, nor did I think there was an outside. I was asleep.\n\nThe house turned quiet as I looked about to see my mother gone, with a feeling knowing my brother the same. I turn to look down the hall for the first time... no cat, however not what I expected. The simple form of a human. Like a shadow with a body, I could see clear through him at the same time I could not. Standing there fully facing me. The micro second it got into my vision it flooded back. The ability to feel the universe out side my dream... that I was dreaming.. that it was a dream. But that didn't matter, because when those feelings and thought came to me they collected into one message \"Someone is in your dream, and they're not suppose to be.\" I was terrified. This shadow of a man standing in front of my door. I couldn't move I couldn't do anything. It's not like it mattered because when the last syllable of the message went through, the figure turns and walks into my room and I awake to see my mother poking me with a confusion as to why I was crying.\n\nI don't know if it was just my head making stuff up, it felt real enough. Since that day I guess subconsciously I have not been scared of any dream, horror media, or surprise attacks from my brothers. After all nothing compares; Don't get me wrong I do get scared of things like spiders in your face or heights. Just that thought alone made monsters look like cute cats...",

Sometimes they're cool, sometimes they are weird, and sometimes really kind of gross(for reasons that won't need to be explored). I don't always pay attention to dreams because they are always so weird, but sometimes I do and I maybe figure somethings out I need to change.\n\nThat being said, this dream I had predicted the future literally.\n\nI work at \\[unnamed call center\\] as a tech support agent. I worked on a team before this for tech, under \\[unnamed supervisor\\]. Well I had a dream last night that she had been let go from the company. From what I remember, they really tried to twist her arm but she wouldn't budge and her only option was to leave. When I woke up, I didn't really think much of that. However, just about 1 hour before I am posting this, she was walked off the floor after a meeting. I am not sure of the why she left, she might have been fired, but I was absolutely shocked. \n\nI can't really say it was coincidence considering it was clear as day who she was in the dream. When I woke up I knew exactly who it was, and I really didn't think she would get fired.",

        "text": "So yesterday was my day off work. I have to bid on my schedule at my job and this next months schedule bid happened to be on my day off. I am involved in a group text with my coworkers so i has been watching the group text throughout the day knowing one of my coworkers would eventually say that the schedule bid had opened up since everyone was talking about it throughout the day on the group text. \n\nLong story short,  I notice a text from one of my coworkers saying the schedule bid is open. The time stamp on the text said 4:24 pm. The reason I noticed the time because I was worried the bid had been open for some time since I hadn’t checked my messages in the last hour and I was concerned I’d get a crappy schedule if that happened. However, when I went to the home screen of my phone after viewing the message, it was only 4:21 pm. \n\nWhat the hell just happened? Did I get a text from the future? I am sure there has to be some logical explanation for this, but I have no idea what that explanation would be. I even watched my texts all day today to verify that this text from the future thing isn’t still happening. I’m completely stumped as to what I just experienced. \n\nUpdate: I probably should have done this before posting my story, but the story was so weird I had to share it! I googled this issue and apparently this can happen if your phone is set to the wrong time zone or if you haven’t updated your phone software recently. I also have an issue where I receive text messages out of order. I will text someone and their response text will be above the text I sent them. From what I’ve read, both of my issues are likely related to a software glitch since I verified I’m set to the right timezone.",

        "text": "I went to college in a big city but usually took the same route to walk to campus every day. I had a different schedule every day, classes, clubs, jobs, etc, but no matter what time of day I walked this route, I would always see this normal looking man, probably mid-40s, and a sort of punk/scene teen girl, maybe 15, with dyed hair and ripped fishnets and heavy boots. They always sat on the same bench outside a store along my walk, and always seem to be chatting but never moving, and they almost always wore the same clothes. And they had this beautiful, purebred looking spaniel with them. Never seen them talk to anyone else, never seen them stand up or leave the bench. \n\nI just went back and visited a few years post-graduation, and I'd forgotten them entirely until I took my old walk and sure enough! THey were still there. Still looked exactly the same as the first time I saw them seven years ago. The only difference is they now have two of these same dogs, almost identical. \n\nThe only obvious explanation would be if they were homeless? How else would an adult man and a teen girl have no where else to be but sitting on the bench? But then how did they acquire a second purebred dog? And they definitely aren't begging, just sitting there, always in conversation with each other and never speaking to anyone else. Plus, their clothes always seem clean enough, I'd say, even though they seem to wear almost exactly the same thing every day, and the girl keeps up with her brightly dyed hair. \n\nI know I could just go back and ask them their story. But they've always given me the creeps honestly. It's like I was walking past two ghosts every day--the way they never moved and never spoke to anyone but each other. I'll admit that it's really silly to be creeped by them, considering I only saw them for 2 minutes twice a day as I approached and passed them, but their stillness and consistency was just unsettling. Especially since they seem not to have moved for seven years. \n\nAny ideas about how to explain this? ",

acceptance of information  \nthat cause the expanding nature of intelligence   \nas it find all by rejecting none and the accepting of all   \ncause unconditional appreciation (LOVE) to exist  \n\n\nTo see all found and find all seen   \ncreate understanding (LOGIC)  \n\n\nThis is the process of evolution that by infinite  \nrealization of own creation state the meaning of life to be GROWTH

SUM OF ALL.  \nAll that exist is derived from GOD   \nand when none exist GOD is total.  \n\n\nThe access to the kingdom of heaven   \nis by allowing trust in truth  \n\n\nFacing the judgment of GOD is facing true reality.  \nIt does not allow the escape of excuse and one is  \nforced to accept responsibility for ones actions.  \n\n\nHumanity live with subjective perception,  \nmeaning individual values that collects as ego.  \n\n\nSubjective perception is the error of a de-activated pineal gland.  \n\n\nDepiction of the pineal gland as Eye Of Horus,  \nand referenced to as The Third Eye,  \ntell of when once active, it enabled humanity  \nthe objective perception of GOD  \n\n\nThis would have allowed a truthful image of reality  \nwhere all would be perceived as complete in  \nits form of existence, thus creating complete  \ndefinition of perfection.  \nBeing objective let us master logic, understanding  \nhow to live beneficial to life's purpose of growth.  \nOur time of objective perception  \nis referred to as paradise, or Garden of Eden.  \n\n\n*All return to GOD*  \n*All return to GOD*  \n\n\n*and GOD was questioned how,*  \n*as you cannot return to what you never left*  \n*and the herd of your creation are born with*  \n*the truth of GOD embedded in their vision*  \n\n\n*Remove the light from their eyes*   \n*and I will deceive them*  \n\n\n*Do the herd of your creation*  \n*return even lost in the dark?*  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n\n\n**GAME OF DECEIT**  \n\n\n**DIVIDE**  \nTo limit exchange of information and understanding,  \nsystems of separation are put in place.   \n\n\n**1.** Racism, the dividing of groups  \n\n\nThis system is visual to enable and include the most participation.  \nThe lowest are the darkest while highest are the lightest.  \n\n\nThe lightest are granted the most, which mean they fight the least.  \nIt also make the highest unwilling to help the lower,  \nas it would risk no longer having the privilege of being on top.  \nThe highest get spoiled with having situations solved and explained for them,  \nwhich give the highest a sense of there being no need to think for oneself.  \n\n\nThe darkest are granted the least, which mean they work the hardest.  \nBeing the lowest also mean that judgment from above cannot be trusted,  \nas it is automatically set up to gain the lowest the least.  \nBecause of this, the lowest are forced to succeed in the effort to  \nfind truth within them selves, meaning the kingdom of heaven.  \n\n\nThis makes the lowest the strongest.  \n\n\n**2.** Sexism, the dividing of men and women  \n\n\nMEN are visual with shallow perception of whole.  \nWOMEN are intuitive with deep perception of detail.  \nBalance between the two enables deep understanding of the general whole.  \n\n\nSEX in balance and love will stimulate all the   \nbodies chakras and cause the rise of kundallini.  \n\n\nThis balance between the sexes is thrown off by the   \nsystem of SEXISM, that claim the stronger sex as deserving   \nof receiving what is obliged by the weaker sex to give.  \n\n\n**3.** Sociopathic programming, the dividing of individuals  \n\n\nProgramming is done using subliminal messages of sex, food and fear.  \nThe effect is a subconscious trigger of the survival instinct, that will convince  \nthe conscious mind of it being both natural and necessary to put ones needs  \nabove others, and value time and activity based on personal sense of gain.  \n\n\nEffect of this programming also include the victim rejecting outside and  \nnew information, as the effort of understanding it must be made before  \nit is possible to determine its value.  \nThe victim will instead recycle old information and modify it to imitate  \nan understanding of the new. This will cause the bond with other people  \nto become superficial, and sympathy will decrease.  \n\n\nThe victim of programming will experience a sense of hollow, stress and  \nanxiety.  \n\n\nThe programming is very easy, effective and done through media devices.  \n\n\n**CONQUER**  \nSearch of meaning is controlled by presenting truth in foreign language.  \nThis way it is recognized as found but not understood.  \nThis will have truth rejected as false, or accepted as impossible to grasp.  \n\n\n**1.** Religion, figurative language  \nThe human mind will interpret an image based on personal association,  \nmeaning ones translation of figurative language is unique.   \nThis is the reason for disagreements regarding the context of religious text.  \n\n\n**2.** Science, mathematical language  \nOppose the spectrum of figurative language is the mathematical language,  \nusing linear presentation of detail. The truth in whole cannot be explained in  \nmathematical language, as the start will be long gone when the end is reached.  \n\n\n**OBEY**  \nAuthority by claiming value that dismantles opposition.  \n\n\n**1.** School  \nTo not accept what school teach present one being unable to accept the correct answer.  \n\n\nThe school system is the training in accepting a narrative presented by authority.  \nThe amount of training is in proportion to the amount of influence and  \nopportunity granted when training is done.  \n\n\n**2.** Legal system  \nTo not accept what the written law dictate present one being oppose justice.  \n\n\nThe legal system is the control and suppression of free will.  \nClaiming to protect society from wrong and evil create the association  \nof one breaking the written law to also be one who is a threat to others.  \n\n\nAs social exclusion is feared, the written law is accepted and followed.  \n\n\n**3.** Entertainment culture  \nTo not accept the display of perfection is to present one having irrational values.  \n\n\nThe entertainment culture exists as the public role model, and is the reason  \nthe image of superior wealth, beauty and success is presented.  \n\n\nThe purpose is to control the narrative of public opinion, promote superficial  \naspirations and distract from reflecting over true reality.  \n\n\n\\- Abuse of humanity is enabled through the system of health care,  \nas it remove evidence of environmental poison.  \n\n\n\\- One unwilling or unable to play the game of deceit is removed  \nand put in institution until proven fit to participate.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n\n\nGOD does not believe in sin, because it is subjective.  \nHuman society use those social constructs.  \n\n\nQ:  \nWhy? That is the big question.  \nA:  \nObjective intelligence found the purpose which neutral love saw.  \nLogic defined the meaning (of life) to be growth.  \nThis process is what we call evolution, and what religion  \nfiguratively expresses as The Father, Son and Holy Ghost.  \n\n\nQ:  \nDear God. Why did you create such morons?  \nSurely we were not created in your image.  \nA:  \nAll that exist is the image of GOD.  \nDeny your own intelligence to  \ntrust another is what morons are made of.  \n\n\nQ:  \nWhy do people say God, when many major ones  \nare apparent like Allah, Christ, Krishna, etc?  \nA:  \nYour question must be what the singular stand for when there are plural.  \nGOD is sum of all.  \nOld stories and figurative expressions; waste no more time argue over synonyms.",

        "text": "Alright, so I made a Mandela Effect post yesterday as a celebration for Mandela's would-be birthday. I included two \"bonus\" events that are actually personal to my life and one memory got some decent attention and someone said I should get some input here. So here we go...\n\nI grew up with a dog, Casey. She was a very dark chocolate lab, almost black just not quite. About 80 pounds-ish, good size. Healthy. Extremely playful. She was the family dog for myself, my two older brothers and older sister, mother, and father. We lived in a two story house - extremely vivid memories include myself sitting in my father's green lazy-boy chair, spinning around with Casey running circles around the chair \"chasing me\" as I was spinning in it. Wrestling with the dog back and forth between my siblings in the living between the couch and TV. Running up and dog the stairs chasing one another and playing tug of war with her toys. That fuckin' dog was a huge part of my childhood, pre-divorce.\n\nMy parents divorced just before I turned 7. For an unexplained reason \\[or perhaps I just don't remember the reason because I was upset\\], we had to get rid of Casey. I guess maybe they didn't want to fight over the dog in the divorce and took the dog out of the picture. I remember loading her up in my father's green Chevrolet Tahoe, and riding with her in the back to her new family who adopted her from us. My father had to literally force me to let her go when we arrive because I was so upset and loved that dog so fucking much.\n\nAnd now, as an adult at 28 years old, I am still the only person on the planet who even remembers the dog's existence. I guess for the rest of my childhood I pushed her out of mind until I was around 15 years old, and then I asked my father about Casey. I never got an answer as a child so I thought I'd ask why we had to get rid of her just because of a divorce. My father told me we never had a dog. My brothers, sister, and mother have all confirmed that the dog never existed. To this very fucking day, I am the ONLY person who remember the dog's existence. And I am pissed off about it because Casey was a huge part of my early childhood...\n\nAnyone else got something like this?",

No reasonable explanations other than I was tired and potentially imagined the whole thing (unlikely, in my opinion).   \n\n\nI was getting off work late one night and I called my wife as I was walking to my car (something I do every night). Tonight's call was memorable (but not out of the ordinary for  my phone) in that I could hear my voice echo in the earpiece every time I said something (dunno why this happens sometimes). The conversation itself was normal and nothing else felt out of place. This is where it gets weird. I remember my wife talking about her day and I specifically thought (using my inner-dialogue) \"I need to ask her to thaw the chicken for tomorrow\". That's when I hear in my earpiece in my voice, \"Can you thaw the chicken for tomorrow?\" She responded as if nothing was weird. The obvious glitch here is that I never spoke those words. So either I had a moment of telepathy on the phone or I need to get more sleep (although, again, I remember the moment pretty clearly and don't think I zoned out while speaking or anything). ",
