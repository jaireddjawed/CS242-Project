        "text": "Fireteeth, the mad alchemist, rides again. This time he managed to ruin a boss fight *before it even started*. It bears explaining.  \n  \nQuick rundown for new arrivals: the party consists of a goblin alchemist (me), a half-orc inquisitor, a human barbarian, and a halfling sorceress. We're running around Magic: The Gathering's gothic horror setting, Innistrad, trying to save totally-not-Avacyn from totally-not-Griselbrand (they shall henceforth be tnA and tnG). Unfortunately, tnA lost her spear and she kind of needs it.  \nOur plan was simple: while the vampires attended a social function at the manor of Olivia Voldaren (a major vampire on Innistrad), the inquisitor and the sorceress were going to abuse her access to multiple uses of dimensional door to retrieve the spear from a nearby temple. Fireteeth's job was to distract the vampires at the party in order to keep them from ruining our theft. Our barbarian's player couldn't make it, which would be for the best, really.  \nThe other two spend the day with Sorin, scouting the party location, the storage location, and nearly getting into a three-way with a vampire lady. Dammit Zarobruck, your libido never knows the right time. Fireteeth spends the day cooking up any and all alchemical party tricks he could possibly require. When night falls, we strike out on our missions.  \nInquisitor and Sorceress arrive at the temple and realize they have no idea what the dimensions on this thing are, and have no idea where to teleport to get the spear. Through dumb luck, they locate it after their first port into the temple. A second port gets them into the display case, triggering an alarm. Luckily, Sorceress had had the foresight to make them invisible beforehand. The spear is immediately drawn into hammerspace through Inquisitor's magic amulet and back to tnA, who promptly teleports them to safety.  \nMeanwhile, Fireteeth finds himself outside a mansion full of vampires, in the dark, with a backpack full of party favors and four 2nd-level spells to his name. All of them are Invisibility. He also has two uses of Greater Invisibility, but that's not important. He sneaks around the outbuildings, borrowing from the stupendous stock of explosives the vampires had in one of the sheds to supplement the stuff he brought in, and rigs all of them to blow. After setting fire to the outbuildings, Fireteeth takes advantage of the chaos (and his invisibility) to sneak into the mansion and free the human captives, paving their way with a corridor of dimmer dust (I mean seriously, a 30-ft. radius of dim light? Sign me up!) to the closest gate. The humans escape, and he embarks on the second part of his totally-not-improvised master plan: working his way around the side of the mansion not facing the fires, and planting more explosives. He then lights the fuse and runs like hell.  \nAt this point, the goddess retrieves Fireteeth from the middle of the woods, winded and looking entirely too satisfied with himself.  \nTruth be told, I don't think my DM really understands how alchemical fire works, because she seems to be treating it like my alchemist's bombs. Either way, she does some rolling behind the screen, and then levels a death glare at me. Between the massive amount of explosives I'd rigged to the house, and the sneak attack damage that she decided it warranted, I had killed Olivia Voldaren. A boss character. Without ever entering combat against her. We learned later that half the vampire population was in that mansion, and there were only a handful of survivors. Oops. I'm not sorry.  \nNext session we fight tnG. If we win, we get to skip straight to level 20. I'm grabbing the axiomatic bomb discovery, and Inquisitor and I have colluded to create a megabomb series with one of his spells. It's going to be a riot.",

        "text": "Duke Loup sat in his chamber in the Duke of Wessex' castle. The wine tasted of dirt, befitting the peasant-lords of the Angle Isles. He missed the comforts of home, his wife's smile, her voice, but most of all he missed his children, Emille would be fifteen in less than a month. She had grown so quickly, too quickly for Alusard Loup's taste, she was... had been betrothed to the Emperor's son, Octavian since the age of four.\n\nLoup was thrown from his thoughts by a knock on his door... could this be it? The letter that would seal his fate?\n\nThe door opened, it was the Duke of Wessex, Loup's step-father by marriage. His face was sullen, but behind his eyes was something else, something that twisted his face, turned him red and spilled out through his mouth.\n\n\"She is dead! You bastard! You envious wastrel! You sulking shit-sack!\"\n\nLoup did not understand, who was dead? Why was it his concern?\n\nThe realization spread through him. A coldness, a pain he did not recognize. Loup, for the first time in his memory, began to cry.\n\n\"You know not why you weep! You fool!\" The Duke said, turning to his guards, \"Drag this fool down to the courtyard, he needs to see, when he has, throw him in the dungeon. I must send a letter to the Emperor.\"\n\nLoup stumbled, weeping and weak, along with the guards.\n\n\"My lord bids you to look, sir.\" The taller guard said.\n\nLoup saw a wagon, surrounded by peasantry, family and guards. White sheets, seven white sheets. Loup ran to the cart, past the guards and ripped at the sheets. He screamed, pain spreading through him, the coldness all consuming. Each head was crowned opulently in the finest golds, each crown a copy of that he once coveted, each fitted meticulously to the proportion of each head. Emille's beauty was marred by the weeks of travel, her eyes had been pecked out, obviously before death, given her expression of pain and fear. Deep tear tracks covered each face.\n\nLoup felt nothing as the guards tore him away. His family was gone, his life was meaningless without them. He found the strength to walk to the dungeon. He collapsed to the dirt floor the moment he was lone. His sobs serenaded him into sleep. He dreamed of the golden fields of his home.\n\nThe Duke was there when he awoke. He was drunk, staring down at Loup.\n\n\"Why?\" he said, slurring violently.\n\nLoup hung his head.\n\n\"Envy\" Loup replied.\n\n\"You had everything sir. My daughter, my grandchildren, a kingdom of your own, in time. Why do this?\" the Duke said, calmer than he should have been.\n\n\"I...\" Loup could not bring himself to admit it. He fought the words.\n\n\"I wanted more...\"\n\nThe Duke of Wessex grabbed the bars, shaking them as he screamed \"More! You were his best friend! You are his cousin, his childhood companion, the man he trusted most!\" the Duke stepped away, throwing the wineskin down the corridor.\n\n\"Your daughter was to be Empress of all France. But you wanted more... this is not envy, this is madness.\"\n\nThe Duke turned away.\n\n\"It does not matter anymore, a Reckoning comes. You should have accepted your fate, now you have doomed us all.\"\n\nThe Duke wandered away, sobbing softly. Loup fell back to sleep, the darkness around him swallowing him whole.\n\nWhen he awoke again, the door was open. Loup raised tentatively to the door. The corridor was clear, no guards stood. He walked the halls, back to the surface. All the doors were open. As he approached the courtyard, he heard them. War drums, shouts of pain, the screams of a siege.\n\nAs he opened the door, the light shone brightly from the armor of the knights. They swarmed the walls, by the thousands. The few thousand men-at-arms that Wessex had mustered were no match. Wessex himself sat in a throne, watching the battle, cackling loudly as his men died, a cask of wine opened next to him.\n\nLoup approached him. Wessex paid him no attention. Loup watched the battle end, as the last of the men-at-arms surrendered. Loup took a sword from a fallen knight and prepared himself to die. He said his prayers, asking god for forgiveness he did not deserve.\n\nThe gates were opened, the knights held the walls, surrounded the courtyard, filing down and surrounding the Duke and his prisoner. Wessex was still laughing.\n\nThe trumpets announced his entrance, all the knights and lords bowed to his magnificence. He sat upon a destrier, armored for war, covered in the blood of the Duke's cavalry. He had been at the front of the battle, by the look of this.\n\nAs he approached the throne, Emperor Tiberian II Rosche, King of Kings, King of France, King of Francia, King of Toulouse and Aragon and Brittany, Navarra, Burgundy, Beloved of God and his holy Pope, brother in-law to the Emperor of the Romans, Crusader Lord, rightful ruler of Hispania and Italy.\n\nHis face was devoid of emotion as he approached Loup, staying his guards. Loup knew he had one chance. He lunged toward the Emperor, whom had not drawn his sword. The blade caught on the heavy armor, cutting shallow upon the shoulder, some blood shed from the wound as the Emperor rested the blade from Loup, beating him with the flat across the arms and chest.\n\nLoup screamed in pain as his bones broke. Wessex laughed all the louder. The beating stopped only long enough for the Emperor to behead Wessex in a single stroke, the head flew far and away, the echoes of his laugh silenced shortly after its fall.\n\nThe emperor stood above Loup, blood covered him, his own and Wessex'. He grabbed Loup, slinging his broken body across his shoulders. He tossed Loup roughly upon Wessex' throne. Throwing the blade into the dirt, point setting it as a cross.\n\nThe emperor removed his armored gauntlet, slapping Loup across the face with it, sending teeth and flesh flying away.\n\n\"I gave you everything!\" the emperor said as he loosened more teeth.\n\n\"We were to be brothers!\" he yelled, the fury sending a part of Loup's tongue flying.\n\n\"I loved you!\" he screamed, knocking Loup and Wessex' throne over with the force of his blow.\n\nThe sword was in his hand before Loup could roll over to face him. Loup felt the bite of steel as his right hand was severed. As Loup rolled over, screaming in pain the Emperor buried the sword through his shoulder and into the dirt below.\n\n\"You killed my son! My only son! For what? Why Allo? Why?! Why?!! Why?!!!\" with each 'why?' he twisted the blade.\n\n\"I hate you!\" the Duke yelled! \"I have always hated you!\" he cried, hoping he could make the pain end if the Emperor was angered,\n\nThe Emperor held the killing blow. Loup saw something he had never seen before, the Emperor wept. Loup had broken the most powerful man in Europe, with a single thrust of a dagger. The sword fell again, Loup's left hand fell lifeless, then the emperor cut his tongue and his eyes. Leaving only his ears.\n\n\"You will wander blind, unable to speak. Everywhere you go, you will be taken care of, you will not die, by law of the land you will be kept alive as you wander, until the end comes for you. Everywhere you go, you will be hated, everywhere you wander, you will be driven away.\"\n\nLoup could no longer weep nor protest. He wandered away into the winter that surrounded.\n\nIn his final days, alone in a foreign land, Loup received a message that was read aloud to him. He had been pardoned by the new Empress of France, the daughter of his old friend. The blade spilled his blood across the sheets of his bed as the cutthroat ended his message. \"With great thanks do I end your suffering.\"\n\nDuke Loup was the heir to the Viceroyalty of Middle Francia. His daughter was set to be Empress at the end of the next turn-year. He made a nonsensical assassination of his to-be son-in-law. Escaped three imprisonment attempts and took refuge in England. The Emperor butchered his entire family, four children, his wife and his parents. When the Duke was captured, after being maimed in battle, the Emperor banished him, seizing all of his assets.\n\nThis is the saddest goddamned thing I have experienced playing this game... as it was absolutely pointless and changed the fate of an entire country.

        "text": "Alright I got a lot to cover, and not much time. So I'll go over some main points leading up to where the group is now.\n\nThird Session:\n\nIt's morning, but the group didn't get a wink of sleep. There were some assholes running around the city in fancy cars and assault rifles. That morning Joggerman doesn't appear, and later sheriff Henderson drives by. The group is disturbed since the usually drunk officer is completely sober.  Henderson tells them that the West River Gang has come to their part of Saxton River.\n\nI don't think I've established this yet to you guys on reddit, so I'll do that now. The city that the players are in is on the coast of Connecticut, the city is called Saxton River and its cut in half by a River. The group is on the west side.\n\nHenderson tells them to watch out and then leaves. Later that day they hear a roaring from down the street and see an immense cherry red convertible go screaming around the corner. The car stops abruptly in front of the groups house. The group watches anxiously as the gang members get out and start looting houses on their street. After a while the gang members take their loot and leave. \n\nYoman decides that he could probably sneak down the street and try to get some supplies. He and Frankie head out to loot a nearby Rite Aid. Jim holds down the fort, and shitty nurse, again, couldn't make it to D&amp;D. As Yoman goes inside the Rite Aid and Frankie keeps watch a group of the gang members drive up and go into the store through the back. With Yoman still inside and Frankie unaware, the gang members start searching for Yoman after they hear movement in the back. Yoman starts sprinting like a motherfucker as the gang starts shooting. He and Frankie start booking it back to their base with only a few bottles of Vodka as loot.\n\nFrankie and Yoman make it back inside the house just as the gang rounds the bend in their convertible. Jim having been in over watch for an hour fires off a shot from his rifle at the driver. Gets a 24 with mods. Driver is rekt and car veers into the sidewalk. \n\nYoman makes a Molotov cocktail and hands it to Frankie who hurls it at the car. After surprise round, 3 of the six gangsters of still up. One being dead and two others screaming as their faces melt off. The gangsters then go, and the first one roll a nat 20 and hit Frankie, hard, with an assault rifle. As Frankie lies dying on the ground Yoman starts applying first aid, and of course shitty nurse misses her only opportunity to be useful. \n\nAs Frankie lays dying he has disturbing dreams of hands in the water grabbing at him, Jim starts picking off the gangsters never rolling anything under a 15, he wrecks them. Jim then throws a Molotov of his own to finish off the the last gangster hiding behind a car. The car blows up setting the neighbors house on fire. Yoman wins first aid and gives Frankie some Vicodin they found.\n\nOf course the explosion attracted hundreds of undead, a horde. ( apparently I've been autocorrected this whole time, sorry.)\n\nNext session: \nA horde of hundreds of undead are swarming the group’s house. After the undead break down their fortifications protecting the living room about 50 ghouls swarm inside. The group decides to barricade the stairs, leading up to the second floor, using bed frames. As the group fights off the horde, a Macaulay Culkin-esque character is watching. \n\nOur friend Dan built a backyard demolition expert who was living in a booby trapped house for a few weeks now. His character was a female, Rose Cassidy. She saw the group's trouble as an opportunity for her to escape the horde outside her house as they had been attracted to the group's.\n\nA police siren wails deep in the streets.\n\nTo destroy the horde she decided to use a bucket of homemade napalm and a homemade trebuchet to napalm the lower floor of the group's house. Rolls an 18. \n\nSuddenly the house is now on fire and filled with burning ghouls. Jim Bean is hit with a drip of the napalm and fails his wisdom save, he starts wailin’ about gettin’ napalmed by his own side and goes into fetal position while taking swigs from his prepared Molotov cocktails.\n\nEvery jumps out the window eventually Jim does as well, but to the group's horror, Dogmeat was left upstairs. And wouldn't jump.\n\nAs people were deciding what to do, Rose bursts into the scene and gets hit by a squad car.\nHenderson gets out to help her up, he yells,\n“The West River Gang’s out for blood, get in the car we got to go!”\n\nThe group all piles into Henderson’s squad car and he books it like a librarian.\n\nThe group now, with Henderson is hurtling at a breakneck pace down the streets of Saxton River. As he attempts to lose the pursuing gangsters he asks the party,\n“Know anywhere to lie low? I've been living in my car for a fair while and I don't think it can fit five.”\nEveryone makes a history check, a chorus of 1s and 2s, but Rose comes in with a 17 and says,\n“There's an abandoned coastguard boat down by the wharves, we could pull up the ladder and hide there for a bit.”\nThe group thinks this is genius as they want to get out of Connecticut more and more, and the river could help them achieve this.\nHenderson pulls up to the wharves the group hides his squad car under fishing nets and they enter the boat. And pull up the ladder. The boat was crashed into the dock.\n\nWhen checking the boats they find a cabin with radio and controls, and a ladder leading down to the lower floor. \nJim heads down, he sees a dark room with several cots and a strange figure huddling in the corner. Without asking any questions he bayonets it in the head. \nGroup is anger. Who was that? Why would you kill someone at random? Jim says meh.\nDuring the argument Rose lets it out that she saved the party by using napalm and finding the boat. \n\nJim faces her,\n“YOU WERE THE GOOK THAT NAPALMED ME?!”\n“I'll have your tooth!”\n\nSome background, Z wanted Jim to have a necklace of ears thing, but couldn't remember that it was ears so he said teeth. He said that Jim used a smithsonian kids rock polishing kit to put a tiny hole in each tooth which he wore around his neck.\n\nHe took a tooth from each person that had wronged him. The 15 Vietcong that massacred his patrol, two men in a bar fight, a pharmacist who wouldn't prescribe him Adderall, despite the fact that pharmacists don't prescribe things.\n\nNow he wanted Rose’s tooth.\n\nThe group decided that this boat would be their new base, and that they should escape Saxton River for good. They inspected the damage and realized two things: One, a patch was needed on the hull. And two, the boat needed fuel.\nThe group decided to work on these.\n\nSorry for the delay, a lot of stuff just happened in the campaign, I'll do another update this week.",

Read the full story here https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3pid0d/can_i_use_my_magic_key_orhow_the_dm_was/\n\n So I was in a dilemma cause the BBEB is a really big bad and they would be woefully under prepared...\n\nBut we had to stop midfight, my red herring fight took longer than they anticipated, which is good cause they think it is the BBEB.\n\nWhen last we left off I used my False Big Bad (FBB) to cast necromantic magic on some NPS, much to the surprise of the players. This magic is going to boost the difficulty of the soldiers they are fighting to change the encounter level. Also I will have a small amount of soldiers flank them from the rear; the soldiers they should have killed had they not outsmarted me.\n\nThe FBB is going to escape down a secret passage during the commotion, which was supposed to happen anyways. When the PCs follow they will encounter two new rooms I prepared over the week. The first, a trap room that ties directly into the story they had been following; the second is a room with some NPCs to kill that will also help explain the final boss room.\n\nFinal boss room brief synopsis; locked in, unending spawn of enemies until prerequisits are met, spawn of the REAL BBEB, players proceed to shit all over themselves at my creation.\n\nWe play this evening and I am looking forward to posting how it all turned out.

Or rather, he still throws enough money around to keep people coming to his barbecues, sporting event viewings, and whatnot. They won't play RPGs with him anymore, but perhaps they feel a bit more comfortable in recent days with watching football or eating by the grill by the pool.\n\nI happened to be there a few times. Not because I wanted to be there, especially recently, but for the sake of a friend, or because he was on the way back from where me and a friend were going and I reluctantly gave in.\n\nAnyway, he catches me by the pool as I'm standing in some tree shade (he's got a nice backyard, lots of plant variety, and I hate charcoal smoke so I can be upwind there), and as if he wasn't banished for good, he suddenly strikes up a RPG conversation.\n\n\"I was thinking, I'm going to be a DM again...\"\n\nI hold my glass of orange juice and my tri-tip sandwich, one getting warm and one getting soggy, trying to zone him out while blankly nodding.\n\n\"... My idea has never been tried before. I've been reading a lot of really good steampunk books. They're probably beyond your reading level...\"\n\nI keep nodding intermittently.\n\n\"... the story involves an eccentric but brilliant scientist named Dr. M...\"\n\nI try very hard not to groan or show visible discomfort.\n\n\"... and the party would be following the notes he left behind, about some time-traveling genius that was always one step ahead of Dr. M, but Dr. M needs the party to fetch those notes and try to build a machine...\"\n\nA bunch of steampunk troupes ensue. I don't remember most of them, but this was years after the fad took off, and was well on its way of getting wearisome to me, the way he burned out my interest in the Lord of the Rings movies by demanding the soundtrack of it be played EVERY. DAMN. GAME.\n\nAs I somehow tuned in involuntarily, he says something like this:\n\n\"... and it turns out that Dr. M and the time-traveling genius thief are one and the same!\"\n\nI credit myself for not having a disgusted look, but I did ask, directly, \"What does the party get to do in all of this, besides follow you around?\"\n\n\"That's just it! They're uncovering a mystery, that loops back to the beginning...\"\n\nI slouched and finally took a bite of my now-soggy sandwich.\n\n\"Look, it may be a bit above your understanding, but I'm not asking YOU to this group. I'm asking if its a good idea.\"\n\n\"No, it's not.\" Why did he ask if something was a good idea if it was 'above my understanding' and if he was not asking me to the group.

        "text": "So I'm currently playing in a 5e campaign with four friends, one of whom is the DM. Allow me to introduce the cast of characters\n\nH: Close friend of mine who takes the roleplaying very seriously, often leading to funny situations where he'll build up this epic attack and fail miserably (thats a story for another time). Playing nobleman Half-Elf Fighter called Aldrick\n\nA: Wasn't present for the session this story explains, but he is new to RPGs. Playing a Chaotic Good Tiefling Paladin.\n\nJ: A friend with an affinity to psychotic characters, J is currently playing a psychotic Chaotic Neutral Warlock/Sorcerer multi class using his IRL name. pretty good character concept: madman obsessed with knowledge so he made pacts and injected himself with dragon blood.\n\nMe: I'm the self appointed leader of the party (with 9 charisma), playing Geoffrey the Human Cleric of Eldath (Goddess of Peace) and former soldier. Only non Chaotic member of the party (Neutral Good), and group healer.\n\nThe party, through a series of hilarious hijinks, have found themselves on a friendly pirate ship. This was after being 'rescued' by the crew of said ship by a not so friendly pirate ship. I put rescued in quotations as in reality we had freed ourselves from captivity and defeated all but one of the pirates, but I digress.\n\nThe captain of the ship, Jonah Swift (parody of a popular film character), welcomed us aboard his ship, but before long we were attacked by an enemy of Jonah's. The party quickly help out, with Aldrick taking control of the steering for a while. Geoffrey ran around healing injured crew men whilst J and Regalious (our paladin) fought off pirate attackers.\n\nAldrick briefly went back to fighting, kicking someone off the edge of the ship. Where they fell 10,000 feet into the water…\n\nWe were on an airship.\n\nUn perturbed by this, the party kept on fighting until the enemy were driven off the ship. The enemy vessel was larger than our own, but Swift's ship was swifter. We started to break free and get ahead when we heard the opposing captain shout some damning words.\n\n\"Release the Kraken!\"\n\nWe were afforded a short rest, allowing all of us to regain spell slots, until the beast arrived. The ship shook as something latched onto its belly. Tentacles rose up, binding the ship in the Sky Kraken's grasp. Swift's men armed themselves with pike and cannon as the party prepared to help. At this point Regalious had to rest from injuries he sustained and retreated below deck.\n\nThe party the damage did to the Kraken was terrible. We were level 3 and this thing could be wailed on us for hours. Thankfully the pirate crew were not only more numerous than us, but better equipped to fight the beast. In the end, Geoffrey drove off the last tentacle with a Sacred Flame spell.\n\nThe kraken released its grasp on our ship and started to flee back to its master. The logical option was too retreat from the fight while we still could. But we were either illogical (J), wanted a glorious fight (Aldrick) or knew a retreating enemy was the easiest target (Geoffrey). So we decided to pursue the beast.\n\nAt this point our DM informed us that lots of the pikes and crew had been damaged/killed, and by charging it head on we couldn't use the cannons. But he didn't consider our ingenuity. We were going to ram the Kraken with the ship itself, with Geoffrey telling Aldrick his ship is the ship that will pierce the heavens. We intimidated Swift into going along with our crazy idea and soon caught up with the Sky Kraken.\n\nGeoffrey rushed to the front of the ship as Aldrick steered her closer. When within range, the party cleric cast Guiding Bolt on the monster, doing decent damage on it but, more importantly, giving the next attack on it advantage. Then it was Aldrick's turn to attack with the entire ship. He rolls his two d20s… and misses horribly. However our DM had given us all inspiration for having the titanium balls to ram the Kraken, and Aldrick rerolled, landing the hit. The kraken was impaled upon the bow of the ship as our DM gleefully told us it was still alive and now on our ship. J then retorted with an Eldritch Blast, which he could use to move his target back 10 feet, pushing the Kraken off the ship. We watched as the beast fell through the clouds. it was gone, but the enemy ship still remained.\n\nWe went in for a boarding action, and our party leapt onto the deck of the enemy ship. J attempted an Eldritch Blast on the captain who dispelled it, much to J's dismay. Geoffrey tried to kick an enemy off the decks he swung aboard and failed horribly, so he smashed his skull with his mace instead.\n\nSwift and Aldrick attacked the rival captain together. The captain was a level 5 Barbarian/Paladin multi class, and he inchanted his great-axe with a smite spell, making it glow red. Aldrick used his magic to call his sword to him, the magic making it glow blue. Swift enchanted his own sword to make it glow green. The three engaged in an epic duel.\n\nMeanwhile, J and Geoffrey were fighting off pirates. J decided to try and finish the fight with a single spell, using shatter on the centre of the deck. Nearly all of the pirates, enemy and friendly, were caught in the blast as the ship was nearly torn asunder. J nearly fell down the now gaping hole himself, if Geoffrey wasn't there to pull him up. The duo rushed to help their party member when the ships shook violently. The Kraken had returned.\n\nMeanwhile, the 2 v 1 fight continued until a Kraken tentacle separated Aldrick from Swift and the enemy captain. Swfit by himself couldn't hold off the enemy and was cut down in front of our eyes. The tentacle raised up, and Aldrick fought the captain one on one, only to take loads of damage and be blasted off the side of the ship, holding on for dear life.\n\nGeoffrey and J quickly devised a plan. The kraken was between the two ships, meaning if they could somehow set all the cannons off at once, they could finally kill it. J had spells capable of such a feat, so that was his task. Geoffrey used his last second level spell to heal all three party members, before trying to distract the captain.\n\nJ cast invisible servant and mage hand to set off all the cannons. The kraken was devastated dropping out of the sky, truly dead. The captain stood over Aldrick, mocking him. But Swift's sword laid near his feet. In an impressive feat of strength, aldrick pulled himself up, grabbing the sword and slicing the captain in half, killing him.\n\nThe four party members were the only survivors. They quickly looted the ship for loot before evacuating as it fell apart, commandeering Swift's to get them to their destination. And that's how we reached level 5.",

        "text": "Yes, I know the idea of \"gaslighting\" goes back to Alfred Hitchcock and was a thing before I (or M) was born. However, I don't believe he knew what gaslighting was, before he became a grandmaster of it.\n\nThis won't be a story as much as tiny snippets from larger events that happened. Maybe I'll tell more stories with the larger bits, but for purposes of satisfying the title of this one, on with the show.\n\nCharacter creation: I tell everyone, for a new campaign, that we'll all be rolling the stats of our characters together. We'd be using the same dice (yes, we had specially made loaded dice as an issue before. D+D is serious business), and we'd make a game of sorts of it. You know, funny sound clips for high rolls and low rolls. We even played \"Push it to the Limit\" from Scarface to motivate people, as well as the Flash Gordon theme song from Queen.\n\nThen M presented his character sheet. \"You can't bitch about this one. I'm just lucky in life, and because your feelings were so hurt, I even accepted something below my standards.\"\n\nBelow his standards was two 18s, a 17, and the rest 16s.\n\n\"We're here to roll, M. We planned this last time-\"\n\n\"YOU DIDNT SAY SHIT LAST TIME!\"\n\nEveryone else got quiet and uncomfortable as they often do when he blasts out like that, too meek to speak to him, especially in his house. Yes, we were still there. Like I said, it took time to finally convince the group that the free food and drinks weren't worth it.\n\n\"I did. Everyone was there.\"\n\n\"YOU FUCKING DID IT WHEN I WAS TAKING A SHIT!\"\n\nIt's never enough to say he had to use the bathroom, \"bio\" or something like that. He felt weirdly oppressed by the concept of manners, so like a Redditor with karma-seeking tics that require him to add \"fuck\" to every few words, so it was with him. \"I have to PISS. Ahhhhhh\" from the other room, and so on, when he went.\n\nBack to the moment, I said no, we did it, and he was sitting there too. Because he was. Not paying attention, sloshed on his wine perhaps.\n\n\"FUCKING BULLSHIT. YOU'RE FUCKED IN THE HEAD, REMEMBER? YOU TOOK PILLS.\"\n\nYes, I did. About ten years before. I guess my license to remember things was revoked.\n\n\"THIS IS SOME AGENDA AGAINST ME. I KNEW YOU HAD BORDERLINE.\"\n\nYes, I have some issues, but after years of working on them, I can say with confidence and professional documentation behind me that 'borderline' was not one of them.\n\n\"I WASN'T FUCKING IN THE ROOM. I WAS TAKING A BIG SHIT.\"\n\nFinally, the quiet group spoke up. Or one of them did. \"You were sitting here, and were kind of drunk.\n\n\"I WAS TIRED. I DON'T GET DRUNK.\"\n\nI answered, sharply, \"So you were tired, not drunk, but were sitting there, not taking a shit.\"\n\n\"WHAT IS WITH YOU AND OBSESSING ABOUT WEAKNESS? NOT EVERYONE HAS TO BE WEAK! FUCKING PC CULTURE...\" he sulked, and started to roll. Mind you, roll out of turn.\n\n\"EIGHTEEN!\" he bellowed, when no one was looking, writing it down. More rolling, not writing down anything unless he bellowed it. While we were busy with others.\n\n\"EIGHTEEN!\" It was going to be a long night.\n",

It is not fit for battle, but the mirrored blade, and even the choice of precious metals selected, was meant to be a covert symbol of criticism-\"\n\nM: Instead off the fucking dagger, how about a greatsword that grants wishes, and instead of that limitation shit, you accept that some people have a better imagination than you do, and just accept the consequences of what I wish for?",

Had them scared a couple times and set on edge a lot more times. Since then one of them had moved, two of us had kids and the others have been completely busy. Needless to say, we didn't have much time to play again. \n\nSo, being in the Halloween spirit, I wrote up this little piece to entice them into playing some more. I referenced events that happened in The Haunting that their characters are being haunted by after the events.  I think it worked:\n\n\nDrip...drip...drip...\n\nYou open your eyes, but darkness still surrounds you, save a slight glint of light in the distance. The light seems to come and go, as if reflecting off of a mirror that is slowly being turned back and forth.\n\nDrip...drip...drip...\n\nThe sound seems to echo into the eternal darkness that engulfs you. You can not find a source. The light, closer now, is coming into focus. You realize that it is a reflection of some sort.  \n\nAs the light spins and dances in the utter dark, you see its true form. It is a small dagger. Shimmering in its reflection is a light of unknown origins.\n\nThe dagger seems to float and twist and swim through the air, as if it had a mind of its own. It circles your head slowly, pointed at you now. Rigid.\n\nDrip...drip...drip...\n\nThe fresh blood pools at the tip of the dagger and falls to the unseen depths below with an echoing and persistent \"DRIP\".\n\nThe dagger slices across your cheek and red hot pain screams through it. You instinctfuly bring your hand to the fresh wound and squeeze your eyes shut in pain.\n\nFffftttfffftttffffftttffffftttt......\n\nThe sound of old pages being rifled through its unmistakable as you spin around to face the noise. The darkness has subsided and you are in a bed room.\n\nA giant tome sits on a desk under candle light, it's pages flipping through on its own, going back and forth, cover to cover. You notice an oddly-textured leather that is binding the book. \n\nClank! Clank! Bang! \n\nThe bed seems to shift and jump inches from the floor with soft metallic \"clinks\", growing louder and more violent each second. \n\nCreeeeeeaaaaaaaak.....\n\nYou turn once more to see the closet door slowly open to reveal deep red eyes staring back at you from the black. Everything in you tells you to run, to flee, but you are stuck. Your legs and feet feel like concrete. You are compelled to stare back at this menacing force behind those blood red eyes.\n\nA horrible, unearthly scream is let loose as the closet door swings wide and the red eyes fly across the room and collide with you.\n\nDarkness again. An airy voice of a women, but deep and raspy as a man, breathes one word, hot and moist on the back of your neck: \"Arkhammmm...\"\n\nYou open your eyes and sit up in bed, drenched in sweat. 'Just a dream,' you think to yourself as you cover your face with your hands, trying to hold back any audible sobs from escaping your trembling lips.\n\nA stinging pain comes with the touch. Your hand retreats from your face and you see the shimmer of blood reflecting in the moonlight. You clutch for the mirror at your bedside and see the freshly made cut across your cheek, dripping with blood.\n\nRoll for Sanity. ",

        "text": "This... is not a happy tale. In fact, its downright painful for me to remember. It was my first time GMing. I had played a table top game no more than three times before in my life: a failed Shadowrun game, a failed 3.5 game, and a 3.5 game DM'd by one of my players, which had fizzled later on.\n\nHowever, I would not be deterred. I gathered a few of my friends, wrote my own fictional setting, created a pantheon for the world, and set in place a sprawling story that wold take them from one end of the continent to the other, traveling and mucking about to save the world.\n\nNot the most original setting, but hey, it was my first time, and I was a bored High Schooler with time to spare (at the cost of my grades...). The plan was for the Player's start at Level 5, I give them the story quest to bind them together, and from there, free reign to get from Point A to Point B and save the world. Hopefully.\n\nSo, lets move onto the players. All are still close friends of mine, and I game with them when I can. But, all that aside, they can be the most min/max-y bunch that you've ever gamed with.\n\nFirst, there was Alcatraz. I cannot use his characters real name, as he has a thing against people depicting his characters in writing, as he notes all his characters down for use in his own works of fiction. And he's a pretty good writer to, if a little heavy handed with the darker undertones. On top of that, he GM'd the 3.5 game I played that didn't flop, had been gaming with his parents for years, using AD&amp;D and 3.5, and could tell a mean story if he put his mind to it. But, past that, who was Alcatraz?\n\nWhy, Alcatraz was the Lawful Evil Tiefling Warlock with the Tomb Tainted Soul feat, Succubus DEVIL Cohort, and aspiring to be a servant of Asmodeus. Who burned down an orphanage at least once a session.\n\nSee, Alcatraz's player had a THING for Devils. He played almost exclusively Lawful Evil characters, would almost always try to become undead, and in the games he ran, Devils would be the main antagonists. He also had a self insert god character, who was an old PC of his, who thankfully stayed buggered off most of the time, but was often times the big bad in his world. Just cause he was the most evilest entity.\n\nA HUGE amount of conditions to play with, but hey, the man told a mean story. I just didn't realize how much trouble he would cause as a player.\n\nMoving on, there was Wright. Now, Wrights player may just be my best friend. I met him in High School, we bounced off each other a bunch of times, and then realized that we were both running Emulators on the school computer's, back before that was a huge deal. So we hung out, and I came to realize that he was a cool dude to hang around with. So, of course, I asked him to join my game.\n\nWhat he built... well, there are certain times, even in an untrained GM's mind, where all their instincts go off. It usually involves the word's \"Hombrew\", \"Race\", and \"Class\".\n\nMine did not. Thus, Wright the Pheonix, a berserking, cursed warrior of the doomed Pheonixan's, was born. A custom class that used his races \"Cursed with Awesome\" power of exploding into a giant fire nuke when the moon is full, and harnessing it to use it like the Monk's Ki abilities. Anytime he wanted. Oh, and their blood could revive the dead. But he could only do that if he was using the other custom class that he made. Which his character swapped between as he constantly retooled him, as he could see how much the character was screwing up the game, and he was trying to fix it.\n\nIt was like trying to use a tweezers to lift the rubble from a rock-slide. That was still happening. Futile, but still trying to help.\n\nAnd finally, Player Three. Someone I have known since middle school, who I think is very intelligent, and loves to use RPG's as a way of de-stressing from their hectic life. What did she make, you ask?\n\nShe made Mialee.\n\nMialee was a Half Elf Were-tiger (Natural Lyncathrope), Ranger with Tiger Companion, Catlord prestige class, which let her shapeshift into a cat (Tiger). She then stacked on Warshapper, fiddled around with a few other, more obscure classes, and ended up with a character that could turn into an Adult Sized red Dragon AT WILL, summon a horde of cats from the surrounding several miles TELEPATHICALLY,  had not one, not two, but THREE animal companions (All Tigers), and was so powerful that nothing, not even the stated gods of my setting could kill her by level 12. \n\nI.. I can't...\n\nThere are so many things I could say. There are so many ways I could describe the broken, inexplicable mess that was this character. How she came to exist, how this monstrosity was allowed into being. I could go on and on, blame it on my inexperience, the player taking advantage of me, 3.5 for being broken as hell, or just an incomplete understanding of the rules.\n\nBut I wont.\n\nI respect the player that played her. I know that she went through the books to find things she thought would be fun to combine and try out, and that the result was a culmination of inexperience and 3.5 at its worst.\n\nThis is the character that haunts me to this day. It is a scourge on my setting, that I can never remove. In its passing, it scarred the fabric of my fictional world. The effect it had is something I would want every GM to experience at least once in their time behind the screen.\n\nFear.\n\nFear, at realizing there is a monster of a character that you let into your game, and that there is nothing you can do to stop it, because it simple. Will. Not. Die.\n\nThis is the character that got the Prestige Class Warshapper BANNED from every other game GM'd by the players of this group or our circle of friends. Simply for having it be the lynch-pin that tied this... thing... together.\n\nSimply so that it could never be created again.\n\nNow, you have met the players and their characters. Obviously, what I have presented is what they became as we played, but I need you to understand what they represent. What these players did to a game world, I have not seen since. And I must share this pain.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen. Strap in for: The Three Players that BROKE D&amp;D\n\nWe open in a throne room. King Zenthier (An NPC I am most proud of, but his backstory comes later) has called for adventure's to aid their county in a time of need. As it happens, the Kingdom of Alzeth (The starting kingdom) is at war with the Kingdom of Ukk (What a wonderful name for the icky-not-nice-nation) to the south. In order to settle the issue, the King had dispatched his son to be a representative and negotiate peace.\n\nThey hadn't heard from him in about three weeks.\n\nSo, the adventurer's were hired to travel to the neighboring Kingdom, make sure the Prince was safe, and, if necessary, topple the royal family and bring the Prince Home. If they succeeded, they would be rewarded with 10K gold a piece, and prestige in the Kingdom.\n\nThis entire plot is almost immediately shoved out the door when the Tiefling begins to make overt threats on the King and another one of the (NPC) Adventurer's. The other players tell him to stuff it, as they want to get the plot moving, but Alcatraz is having a grand time messing with the other Adventure (A warlock, who we will come back to), and making thinly veiled threats as to how he would love to paint his armor with the king's blood in the name of his good.\n\nYeah, remember how I said he played Lawful Evil characters? That's how he played Lawful Evil characters.\n\nNot having any of this, the King pulled a lever by his thrown, dropping all seven adventurer's down into a pit under the throne room. Then, a wall of force popped up over the top, so that Wright couldn't fly out (He could fly from level one, did I mention that? Homebrew races are neat!)\n\nWell, now all together, the players demand to know what they are supposed to do. The King responds that he wants to see if they are what they cracked up to be, and not just full of hot air (directed at Alcatraz). So, the have an Owl Bear sicked on them from the side of the room, and combat commences.\n\nOne Owl Bear, run by a newbie GM, versus seven Lv 5 characters is quickly done in. Impressed, the King has his Head Mage, his grouchy, Lv 20 Wizard who is his older sister, with a fondness for lightning-bolt, lift the force spell. Then she floated down on feather fall to lead the players back up to the King.\n\nHowever, Alcatraz has not got his fill of combat, and is ragging on one of the NPC's, a large, intimidating Half-Orc with four levels of fighter and one level of Crusader (What, I was new, not stupid. I devoured just about every D&amp;D 3.5 book, and I built NPC's like player characters. Not fair, but satisfying).\n\nThe Half-Orc decides he has had enough of Alcatraz's shit, and challenges him to a fight. Alcatraz accepts, and blasts the Half-Orc to oblivion. Did I mention he was a Warlock? And they get unlimited Eldritch Blast? But of course you knew that.\n\nI did not. I thought their Invocation's Known was their Blast uses. Everyone had a good laugh, but I still had a dead NPC. So,the story shifted.\n\nInstead of joining up with (the obviously evil Tiefling) the player characters, the three NPC's made their own mini-group and left. This was partly to give the players more challenge, as I realized they didn't need help to murder stuff, and that at least one of the party members was willing to kill NPC's for fun.\n\nSo, the Archmage tazes Alcatraz, Wright hauls him up with them all, and the King sends the two parties on their way. So they depart, the Warlock claiming that his group will be the ones to rescue the prince, and then leading his party off into the city. Unconcerned, the players then seek out a bar (We had a running joke where I would make up funny names for the taverns. The first one was the Swine and Dine, or something like that).\n\nOnce introductions are over, the three draw up a plan: get on a trade caravan, offer to bodyguard it for their passage fee, and then ride it to the next town, a few day's travel away. This was because they were low on starting cash, having spent it all on gear.\n\nThe plan is quickly accepted, and everyone splits off to do their own things. Wright approaches a caravan leaving town that day, owned by Johnson Johnson, of Johnson and Jonson Co. Old J.J. is a character I rather like, and I still have him pop up from time to time in other games I run, and all three of my players chuckle at his appearance. He's a short, balding man, rather overweight, wearing, for all intensive purposes, a suit and bowler hat (Tricorne hat), a monocle, and a fancy rapier on his (quite wide) hip. He was built as a level 7 Rogue/Swashbuckler, with the feat that lets the two classes stack Sneak Attack and Bonus to hit, and is no slouch in a fight. He also had really good UMD, and carried a couple of unidentified wands as a 'last resort, by-the-by.'\n\nThe player's latched onto him, and agreed they must escort him, if simply to make me keep talking in the stupid voice I was using. Well, it got them moving, so that was a win.\n\nMialee, meanwhile, was poking around the Temple. See, I had made custom god's for the setting, and I had opted for a more Greek Style pantheon: the gods are all dicks, and they tend to wander the earth at random intervals, so everyone is VERY much aware of them, and keen to not piss them off. As such, She was inquiring as to which god's elves now worshiped. I informed her that they would worship Jun, goddess of the forests, harvests, childbirth, and undying rage.\n\nThe reasoning for this was due to seasonal change and life/death, circle of life stuff. Not that it mattered. Mialee said cool, and that was that. Still, it had ramifications later, but it was good that I got to feed them a little about the world and get them into the flow.\n\nAlcatraz... sigh... Alcatraz had started asking around as to where to find an orphanage.\n\nWhen I questioned him as to why he wanted to know, he informed me that he wanted to aim for a prestige class later on, one that tied him as a Disciple of one of the Lords of the Seven Hells, not just a general Asmodeus worshiper. I had informed him that the Seven Hells didn't exactly exist in my setting, but he insisted that Hell had to insist, as where did the souls go when they died otherwise?\n\n(I could rant here about my cosmology, but it came back to bite him later, so I shall save it. Just know that he got his devils. And then some)\n\nSo I said fine, you track down an orphanage. Now, I figured, as a Lawful Evil character, he would take one of the children, taint the children to evil, maybe defile a nun (it was an orphanage run by Nun's. They wore all White and had a small choir group that competed with the bigger church's at the religious holiday's. WORLD BUILDING!)\n\nI was not prepared for him to walk up, in plain daylight, with witnesses, and set the orphanage on fire with repeated application of Hellfire Blast. Oh, right, see, as they were level 5, he had taken all three levels of Hellfire Warlock. So his blasts dealt Eldritch Fire that smelled of brimstone and could not be extinguished. He then danced a jig while cackling to his dark god as the children and Nuns screamed and burned inside.\n\nThe other players were stunned. I was stunned. Then he asks \"So, Wright, how goes that plan to bodyguard a caravan?\"\n\nWithin the hour, the City Guard are swarming the area, trying to find out who did it. Some claim it was an arsonist, others said it was a madman made of fire, still others said a demon wearing the skin of the man. Everyone failed their \"rat on Alcatraz\" rolls, so he got away, and the party set off with their psychotic teammate in tow.\n\nHis alignment was still Lawful Evil.\n\nI blame this on inexperience. I mean, sure it was evil, maybe not LAWFUL, but it was EVIL. And if I forced him to change alignment, he wouldn't be able to get that prestige class he had made this character to get. And I would feel guilty.\n\nThese are all terrible justifications, and nowadays I would have smacked him with an alignment change like it was a day old fish in a newspaper. It stinks, but is deserved.\n\nThus began the player's long descent into Brokenness. There is so much more to tell, but I will stop here for now. When I can muster the will to delve into my memories of this campaign, I shall continue. Until then, happy gaming.\n\nEDIT: [Next Story!](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3rb44a/the_three_players_that_broke_dd_part_2_of/)",

        "text": "This one's short, sweet, and is right before the first time M was kicked out of my longest-running group. It was not the last time, but it was quite a storied time.\n\nIn summary: classic final boss big speech big build-up encounter. Details only relevant to those who were in that campaign for years, but the relevant part for the story: The big bad main villain, who has been twisting a goddess's well-intentions since the beginning of the world's existence, who was known for plans within plans and for implanting insidious suggestions that wrapped around to bite the ass of the descendants of the people he made dealings with, was giving his big bad villain speech.\n\nThe usual power temptations, all that good stuff.\n\nThing is, M was smart enough to see that the big bad was RIGHT. About everything. His contrarianism turned him, suddenly, into a raving fanboy for him. And this happened, incredibly, after he whined his way into semi-immortality and demi-godhood with a combination of metagame demands and bribing the group with fine food and drink over time. Yes, I learned better after this incident, but stick with me.\n\nNothing remarkable or even original was offered. It was the old \"the goddess was frail and pathetic. Look at how her world wilts before the power of those who are unafraid to reach out, and TAKE!\" you know, mwahahaha stuff. No one outside of a serious edgelord would really get into it.\n\nAnd so M did. He broke ranks, sided with the villain. I even said, OOCly, that if he and the villain won, sure, they are the new gods of the world they are making. Knowing M's real life politics it was likely wild dreams of blandness and no icky \"weird\" races except things to kill and all kinds of slave girls cooing for him. Basically Gor.\n\nAnd the final battle was fought. And I did give the party a hell of a fight, especially because M was also fighting them.\n\nBuuuuuut, evil lost.\n\nI mentioned, during a very long and (to the rest) moving epilogue, that the land was healing, that the light was returning, all that good troupey stuff that I am not ashamed to enjoy in a fantasy yarn. But I briefly mentioned that he that turned away from the light and at the final hour embraced darkness was stripped of all his blessings.\n\nYes, that meant that M was going to die. It's like I was his doctor and told him he had terminal cancer and weeks to live.\n\nThe whining broke the rest of the epilogue, the angry, fuming, \"YOU TRICKED MEEEEEEEE!\" stuff. \"YOU JUST WANT TO SEE ME DIE!\" It was... really uncomfortable.\n\nThis is why friends don't let friends play blatant ego-inserts of themselves, and this guy could not play anything but.\n\nAnyway, I feel very guilty for saying this, but I gave in, enough to give a vague, half-hearted open-ended fate for him: \"And M resought to regain the favor that he threw away, seeking redemption and, perhaps, a return to grace\".\n\nThe sulking continued. \"I DID NOTHING WROOOOOONG. YOU TRICKED ME!\"\n\nThe night ended awkwardly. He was voted out, for the first time.\n\nAnd as I said, his quest of 'redemption' as a player was a total failure after we gave him that last chance.",

The name grew on me) were at their usual truck stop hangout, which was where the very-out-of-place Mr. Johnson could be found. I say out-of-place because he wasn't just super stiffly dressed and lacked skin blemishes or any identifying markers except \"artifically cheerful toothy smile\", but because he was also far too antiseptic for a truck stop. Life seemed to die around him as he sat there.\n\nI showed the group a picture of this guy so they get the idea: http://bbsimg.ngfiles.com/1/15923000/ngbbs47f16505a1337.jpg\n\nAnyway, Johnson sent them off to assassinate a specific junior executive that was operating out of a nondescript (but heavily guarded) office building that was overlooking some prime beachfront property. One of the group members, the overly-specialized, min-max sniper, wrote down on his character sheet that the character's name was, I think, Kaeden or something. It was one of those yuppie brat names, the kind you'll hear in a supermarket as a helicopter mom follows around little Kaeden as he knocks over merchandise and makes a lot of noise. He wanted to call himself \"scorpion\" or something, but it never stuck. He even described his High-Altitude-Low-Opening parachute as having his custom logo on it, and the Wifefuckers said \"no, it says K-A-E-D-E-N across it.\" And so it was.\n\nAnyway, the Wifefuckers and KAEDEN arrived on site, and KAEDEN immediately planted his belly on a grassy hill on a golf course kind of far from the site of the run and loaded his sniper rifle.\n\n\"We're not even there yet. And you're just going to lay there?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\nSo more planning is done, security drones are accounted for, guard routines are watched, so on and so forth. But like most Shadowruns that get a lot of planning done, it was all thrown out the window as soon as it started.\n\nEvery few rounds, to be charitable, I'd ask KAEDEN, \"Well, wanna go over there and help?\"\n\n\"Nah.\"\n\n\"Want to do anything while you're laying there?\"\n\n\"Poop and pee, maybe.\" Collective groans around the table. \"My suit is designed for that. But I'm not moving.\"\n\nThings continued to go to hell. Some old people with stupid colorful golf outfits tried to bother KAEDEN, but he kept laying there. They tried shooting golf balls toward where he laid, passive-aggressively, but none of them hit, so we didn't have to re-create that scene from that movie Falling Down.\n\nAs I said, the Shadowrun inside the facility went to hell. Shootouts, explosions, attrition, ammo running low, and it was so sloppy, after a few hours of playtime, that I had to tell the group, \"Well, considering how bungled that was, the junior executive felt he might be in danger and is heading to the private helipad just outside-\"\n\n\"I take the shot\". I forgot about KAEDEN at that point, and so did everyone else.\n\nHe was one of those brick-of-dice min-max monsters. I didn't bother calculating damage. I just got really creative with my blood and head-fillings dispersal pattern description.\n\n\"Thanks for the distraction.\" Said KAEDEN. \"Now if you'll excuse me, my pants are getting heavy.\"",

        "text": "This takes place somewhat late in the M timeline. It was after he was kicked out once, but after his wife made me feel very guilty about kicking him out, and after he sent me a hand-written letter with a (at the time) moving apology in it where he seemed to own up to his behavior and attitude, I put it to a vote, and narrowly, he was given another chance. He was voted out a second time, but in the time between, this story happened.\n\nM was aggressive in many ways, and one of them was putting forward a lifestyle image of success, power, and self-improvement. While self-improvement is well and good, his idea of presenting it in a marketable way including bringing pinto beans spread over cottage cheese and rather loudly slurping them during many sessions. You may like pinto beans, you may like cottage cheese (I personally don't want to mix these two items), but he would spread his legs out, take up two spaces that weren't needed at the table, have his elbows thumped forward and grunt and make cave-man like sounds while slurping. He was just waiting for someone to look his way, so he could glare and say \"WHAT? I NEED PROTEIN. I LIFT A LOT. I HAVE A GYM IN MY HOUSE.\" It made his tantrum sessions even more comical because they would involve neatly carrying off the unfinished bowl in an angry waddling-stamp.\n\nWhat made him angry? Being damaged. Almost. Every. Time. Receiving a debuff. Being told an attempt to do something failed, often reacted to with a \"I WROTE A FUCKING LETTER! YOU STILL HAVE IT IN FOR ME!\" And yes, at the time, I made seduction attempts highly limited, and tried to steer them toward things like \"she likes you enough to look the other way as you do (adventure action) and waves as you run for it after\". We were \"gay\" for that, we were \"angry virgins\" (his term for not needing to bang NPCs constantly), and so on, usually said in a caveman low mutter, head down.\n\nSpeaking of head down, he would get so sloshed on fancy wine of his own purchasing that he would leave his forehead on the table, and then sometimes sit up only to say \"this is good wine. You wouldn't appreciate it because you're all peasants\". Yes, he was both a wine snob and probably an alcoholic.\n\nOne time when he was doing the forehead-on-rolling-table thing, we were deeply involved in a land-spanning expedition, having fought our way through a hostile trading port, escaping through smuggler tunnels, were enduring downpours from monsoons and monstrous flora and fauna alike in a primordeal jungle in the search for the macguffin, and then a growling cave-man grunt from M was sounded out.\n\n\"Are we on my boat?\"\n\nWe were not on his boat since the start of the session. We didn't even particularly like his boat, because he staffed it almost entirely with boring NPC sycophants that I wish I never made for him and that he added up over time like Mitt Romney's Bindas Fulla Wimmen. Not all of them were female NPCs, mind you: he seemed to have a curious need for male short people and silly-voiced people and generally little comic relief figures he could chuckle at because he is big and mighty and relevant and jovial as long as he doesn't take damage.\n\nLater in that same session, for some reason, the post-session chat was about what troupes or characters each character was like. One of our guys was \"Old Greg\" from Mighty Boosh, we decided, because he got stung by a poisonous fish, and had so many swingy 1s and 20s results from the aftermath that we determined that his leg was deformed and bloated and the toes were almost fully absorbed into a stump-like mass, from a terrible toxin that should have killed him but (for fun) I gave him additional saving throws that he rolled natural crits for. So, he had high poison resistance in return for a horribly deformed leg, with sailors and adventurers in taverns alike muttering about the weird fellow. He embraced it, and ignored his character name and started saying \"I'm OLD GREG!\" around the table to reflect the legend.\n\nThere were a few other character comparisons, but then M got up from his forehead-nappy wine time. \"I am like Conan, but also a genius like a Jules Verne character\". No, that's not how it works, M. Everyone else says what you are.\n\nSomeone said \"No, M is more like Zapp Brannigan.\" And we all started to laugh and agree.\n\nHe stomped out of the room. A little louder than before.\n",

        "text": "This story takes place 10 years or so before my previous one. This was the first group I ever had (beyond just playing with M himself), and my DMing was far from perfect. It's only relevant to the story because this old group had fair reason to see if someone else could do a better job. If anyone wants to know, I made the bad DM mistake of making NPCs that were too important for the party to kill off or ignore. They weren't \"Mary Sues\" as much as \"I can't believe you guys don't like the wisecracking mercenary thief I had following you around! He's unconscious so you let him die?!\" It took years for me to learn that DMing is the most fun (and most fun for players) when you accept that most enemies are beautifully crafted pinatas to break open for prizes, and to celebrate rather than get frustrated at players doing better than expected. That is, unless they play like M.\n\nWell, with that aside, on to the prequel story.\n\nBecause someone asked before, at the time (and all time after except now with a receding hairline with a rather in-denial comb-over), M would appear at every game perpetually \"scruffy\" on purpose. Shaving wasn't good enough for him, but he wanted an even tough-guy fuzz, so he came in that. He had a neurotic hang-up over parting his hair to the left or to the right, so he parted it exactly down the middle, all the time. (He had weird commitment problems with making decisions like that, even in D+D, for instance refusing to belong to any specific region or having any cultural identity but \"unknown wanderer\" but that's another story). He'd sometimes, as a territory-marking ritual, do a half-attempt to shave, but leave shaving scum in the sink and not wash it down, because quote, \"cleaning is for women\". Mind you, in other people's houses in this 10 year ago time. He didn't dress particularly egregiously, except for edgy things on his shirts like \"BIGGEST COCK ON THE BLOCK\".\n\nI will admit and hope I don't regret it later, that at the time of this story, I was recently hospitalized for acute depression and 5150'd. I had antidepressant medications, which he found and showed off when I was out of the session room, to get the group to laugh about \"how fucked up in the head\" I was. This group was mostly high school kids, including myself, so you might imagine that compassion wasn't people's strong suit.\n\nI was crushed. So, I told the group I was quitting, and I did. I left that night without playing.\n\nBut this is where the main story begins, based upon those group members calling me back, weeks later, and not just one but three different members of the group each gave their own accounts of what happened next. The parts that all lined up and sounded the most factual, I will now share.\n\nHe immediately, as I LEFT THE ROOM, declared himself the new DM. Accounts varied, but since he still had the pills I brought with me, he apparently made them into some edgy hilarious prop at some point during the game. Mind you, this is a person who used me as his ego-feeder solo DM for years before this point. Saying \"no\" to him created such a deep resentment for me that suddenly it was fair game to make a very unpleasant adolescence even worse to score points with the other teens in the room.\n\nHe said things would be different, that it would no longer be about my tyranny and my refusal to give people what they wanted (what people wanted was a highly debatable question, but it'll make sense in a paragraph or two).\n\nHe started the \"adventure\" with a few 1 hitdie (for non players, very fragile NPCs) bandits that according to him, just robbed a bank or something, so they were really loaded down with gold. They were killed easily, of course, and for a short while, the players reporting to me admitted there was a temporary rush as they could suddenly afford everything they could immediately ask for.\n\nThen his DMPC showed up. Yep, it was M, again, this time the same person, same appearance, same him in real life with better stats, in this particular version, also a fighter with the \"hero\" kit that he made up himself. This was 2nd Edition AD&amp;D. \"Kits\" were a sloppy, unbalanced mess as it was, and he declared his \"hero\" kit, as DM, meant he could fight like a fighter, cast like a wizard (without \"faggy spellbooks\" all three witnesses said), could cast like a cleric without \"feeble and false gods as a crutch\" (yep, he wanted to be one of those 'atheist' clerics you may have heard about in bad RPG tales), and could also sneak as a thief. He didn't bother removing armor restrictions, because he typically described himself being basically naked except boots and a loincloth. All the time. Yes, his Armor Class wasn't so good because of that, even with his maximum Dexterity, but when I was DM he would have tantrums until monsters missed ALMOST. EVERY. TIME. So it didn't matter. Oh, he didn't know what a DMPC was, but he wanted to play/win AND say how he plays/wins.\n\nThe people who played said that most \"fights\" were over before they started, because M would give a bellowing chuckle, and feeble weak imbecilic enemies would run for their lives. He didn't even bother giving himself fights, and even told the group \"IT'S A STUPID CLICHE THAT THE BAD GUYS ARE ALWAYS SOOOOO POWERFUL. WHY CAN'T WE LAUGH AT THEM?\" As the night progressed, he in a huff started making enemies that could hurt people (but not hurt him, because they were still afraid of M).\n\nHe had \"puzzle\" encounters that he solved by ignoring the puzzle. He would let the group be stumped, then he would, in one case, leap directly into the giant stone face's mouth, make it explode after saying \"UH OH\" then twirl his huge two-handed-weapon in a flourish as the group kind of wished they could have answered the stone face's riddle.\n\nThe DMPC didn't need to seduce much. Most female NPCs were already his \"carelessly forgotten\" conquests from some point or another, which he would point out, but be boasted that none were jealous because they embraced their primal instincts and weren't \"brainwashed by modern feminazi bullshit\". He created biotruths decades before the internet started circulating the idea, more or less.\n\nOh yes, many of them died, right in front of the party. Usually violently torn apart by some monster after he implied he was bedding them during a camping stop. He'd give a brief roaring revenge bellow and instantly kill said monster, do a brief mourning caveman thing, then meet his conquests the next town over. All three people mentioned how creepy that was getting, but said he toned it down when the air got uncomfortable.\n\nThey didn't really \"adventure\" in the two or so weeks that they played with him as DM. They followed M around, he constantly restated in thinly veiled terms how much sex he had around the realm, and sometimes he'd punch a hole through the wall of some treasure vault and the weak, puny sissy guards of whatever sissy kingdom would run for their lives. Or, the mighty queen of some kingdom would throw herself at his feet and offer the party MORE TREASURE.\n\nI don't know all the details, but unanimously, the group wanted me back. There was only vague apology for the humiliation I experienced before, but those were rough times, and I was lonely and missed my group too.\n\nHe stopped coming, completely. It wasn't exactly said why, but he fell out of that group and occassionally the group would crack jokes at his expense. It was being mean to him instead of me, but I was so angry at him that, at the time, it seemed fair enough to me.\n\nI felt guilty enough about ranting about some of his narcissistic and creepy antics with the group, for months after that, when that group finally dissolved, I decided maybe it was time to extend an olive branch to M. Which leads into the story I wrote originally.\n",

        "text": "I almost decided to call him \"Moneybags\" but M will do.\n\nBackground: Unlike many neckbeards, he found a very, very patient girlfriend that became his wife and has two daughters that I am worried about (and you might see why if I get to that). I call him M because as a no-exceptions personal quirk, he absolutely had to have an M at the start of every character he ever made in every RPG (and video game) that I have ever seen him play. Usually, he'd just use his full real name, but when he didn't, the M HAD to be there. Also with no exception he had to play characters that represented an idealized version of himself, same hair color, eye color, so on. If a game didn't allow this \"customization\", no matter how good it was, he would refuse to play it. No M-name, no perfected M-persona, no play.\n\nAnyway, here's one of many stories.\n\nMy Dungeons and Dragons group was invited to play at M's house. This was a big deal, since I used to run games ONLY for him for years (I didn't have a D+D group for the first few years I dabbled, just him), and he was very demanding, even abusive. I can tell those stories later if interested. Anyway, the group believed that since that was almost a decade ago, and since they had yet to meet him, and because they wanted a permanent place to play, that was the place to be. So, I agreed.\n\nM had an entire large room of his house designated his \"Man Cave\". I heard the term for the first time, ever, when he used it. It was an impressive room, deliberately designed when the house was built to resemble a fantasy-RPG tavern, with dark wooden wallboards, a fully stocked bar, swords and even armor, fur carpets and much more all over the place, with a converted pool table turned into essentially the perfect rolling surface.\n\nFor the first few sessions, I believed M had grown up since my high school years. Having a wife and children on the way (they weren't born yet in this story) must have changed him, right?\n\nI was wrong.\n\nThird session in, he was attacked by a monster and took damage (this typically happens a lot in D+D). He violently spiked the die on the table, shouted \"YOU STILL HAVE IT IN FOR ME!\" and stamped out of the room. And he did stamp. The floorboards creaked with stamp stamp stamp sounds on the fluffy carpet. We tried to sort of ignore what just happened, but by the time I got to the next player, he stamped right back. \"WHY DID YOU SKIP MY TURN! THIS IS MY HOUSE! THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?!\"\n\nWith awkwardness and silence around the table, I returned to his turn. I even rerolled the die. He was hit again. \"THIS IS SUCH BULLSHIT. YOU JUST WANT TO SEE ME LOSE BECAUSE YOU RESENT ME.\" The all-caps are in-character. He bellows when he's upset, in a false-deep voice that I've known him for since roughly when he hit puberty.\n\nThe reason he was hit was because I rolled it. He demanded to see me roll again, without the usual DM screen that is used to prevent exactly what he was doing: demanding selectively absolute adherence to the rules. Mind you, I typically used the screen to SAVE people, as in, pretend a bad roll didn't happen if it would kill off a character in what seemed like an unfair or arbitrary way. He was in no danger of his M-character dying. He took damage, that is all.\n\nI decided to roll all dice for the game's outcomes in the open, for all players and all NPCs. That was when one of my players noted to me that M wasn't technically rolling: he was flattening his hand on the table with the highest numbers top-up. He got angry at that, but started to roll for real: only not on his turn, and just rolling because he was bored, he said. Until he rolled a 20 (a \"critical success\" in most 20 sided die rolls). Then he yelled \"TWENTY!\" with a deep bellow, and demanded, whenever it happened, to know what he earned/won/killed/stole. Of course it was not his turn, and he accused me of ignoring him as this night went on.\n\nIt got worse when the adventuring party came to town. \"TWENTY!\" bellowed M, when they were chatting with a temple priestess about some story-related thing. \"I SEDUCED HER.\"\n\nThe group was quiet and a little shy, and I wanted the damn game to continue, so I said \"Fine, she's seduced.\"\n\n\"What does she say to me?\" His voice finally stopped bellowing.\n\n\"She says seduced things.\"\n\n\"WHAT THE FUCK? I KNOW YOU'RE A LONELY VIRGIN (If it matters at all, at the time, I was not), but I WANT YOU TO ROLEPLAY LIKE YOU DO WITH THE OTHERS HERE! WHAT DOES SHE SAY TO MY NATURAL CHARM?\"\n\nI don't remember what I said but I felt rather icky saying it. It was not the first time, as I said before, he was my only player for a long time before this group existed, but I took some comfort in reading their awkward expressions as I roleplayed a head-over-heels infatuated love interest for M.\n\n\"I SHALL RETURN SOON,\" he says, making a motion of walking arm-in-arm with my NPC priestess. \"HOW IS SHE IN BED?\"\n\nI took a stand here. \"We're not going there.\"\n\n\"DON'T BE SUCH A POLITICALLY CORRECT PRUDE!\" (the term \"SJW\" didn't yet exist, but he was definitely never let go of the \"PC gone mad\" 90s thing) \"THERE IS NOTHING SHAMEFUL ABOUT SEX! I HAVE SEX ALL THE TIME!\"\n\nHis wife was across the house but I can't help but imagine how she felt about this sex-trophy thing, or that he wanted his DM to face-to-face roleplay out a sex act for him.\n\nI took my stand and maintained it. No sex roleplay. He sulked, mumbled something about how I must be gay, and we continued. Here's the biggest beard moment of the night, in my opinion: Since I was going to have the NPC priestess accompany the group to the next dungeon anyway, I decided she was going to follow her \"lover\" and even make some deity-inspired statements about where they were going and why they should care.\n\n\"Hey... could you kill her off?\" M asked. I asked for an explanation. \"I mean, of course WE are not going to kill her, but can she die dramatically, like all the girls do in James Bond movies? (I swear to Vecna he said that, verbatim) I could avenge her or something, but she's getting boring and I want to move on.\"\n\nI stopped the session then, but he wanted everyone to hear his proclamation: He would be the NEW and improved, superior DM, because he's well-read, much better educated, and has far more social experience than I did. The group, at the time, for whatever reason, was divided enough in the idea that it came to a vote. I narrowly kept my seat, and he sulked.\n\n\"THE FUCK IS WITH YOU NERDS? I GIVE YOU A MAN CAVE, I GIVE YOU WINE (he is probably an alcoholic but that's another story), AND YOU DON'T EVEN GIVE ME A CHANCE! WHAT DID HE SAY ABOUT ME, HUH?\"\n\nIn my defense, I said little about him until that point, when I realized M had not changed much at all since childhood, except now he had money, a wife, and kids on the way.\n\nIf the story was interesting, I have more, plenty more, forward and backward, from the beginning to the end of the Many Sexual Conquests and Effortless Victories of M. They come in Shadowrun, Heavy Gear, Mechwarrior, and homebrew flavors too.\n\nFinal note: He was kicked out twice, the second time, permanently. We had to find another place to play but it was worth it.",

        "text": "For the purposes of reducing repetition, I will say that M played Shadowrun (for those who don't know Shadowrun, it's an RPG that sort of plays like The Matrix had a baby with Dungeons and Dragons in the relatively near future. Amazingly, it predates The Matrix by a number of years), roughly like he played D+D. Have sex with everything female, complain if seduction rolls fail, have tantrums when people hit him.\n\nI DID have a Shadowrun group, but unfortunately, I originally only had M to play with for a few years.\n\nTo make the Shadowrun experience stand out from D+D, here are some highlights.\n\nHe didn't want to \"run the shadows\". That was cliche (lots of things were cliche to him that didn't involve sex and winning). He wanted to be a CORPORATE ENFORCER. And not only that, but because he was my only player, I had no choice but resort to \"I guess they don't kill you because that would end the game and you would have a tantrum\" squeak-bys in the storytelling, which lead to him somehow, quickly, having his own super secret underground base, with his own lab (where he did his own research and development), where he didn't need anyone's help except for (surprise!) hot scientist chicks that he basically kidnapped during his Corporate Enforcer runs. He insisted this armor called \"spectra shield\" from Jagged Alliance was real, and that it could stop bullets cold, and yet he only wanted to wear it on his chest, and would throw a tantrum if I even suggested some opponents might start aiming for his head. Also, he insisted that no corporation could invent the same armor, or for that matter weapons to penetrate it.\n\nOh, some highlights of his \"Corporate Enforcement\":\n\nHe hated teenie bopper bands, so he basically demanded I give him a mission where he assassinates some teenage girl starlets. He laughed out loud, and hard, when I described the armored limo they were in, that he lifted with his non-augmented (because implants are for the weak) super strength and caused the limo to tumble off a bridge into the bay, drowning them.\n\nLater, he got a supplement book that mentioned a bio-engineered weapon called \"Doom\" and he wanted to drop it on a metahuman rights charity concert. Yes, he also did pro bono jobs for the Humanis terrorist group, forgot to mention that. He wanted me to describe the enfeebled, dying survivors that were crawling around, and laugh at the 'freaks' as they died in the street. Oh yeah, he always plays Human. Period.\n\nAnd, after all of this, years later, he wanted to tell my first Shadowrun group about what an awesome \"hero\" he was and how he single-handedly basically ruled the world. Not because I was forced to say \"okay\" to at least have a game to play, to every demand of his, up to and including telling ME what happened next.\n\nI had to find a spine, and I did, after these experiences. I promise. I found out \"no\" was a powerful world, and even more powerful if you don't run RPGs at a rich narcissist's house.\n",

Don't ask...\n\nSo the heads both can use spells but there dex and constitution must be the same they both get a starting three spell slots and since he is a solo I gave him fireball of 1d10 damage because it's so cool. \n\nRight now in the campaign this ogre magi is the king of the goblins of the north and has a lovable companion named Grubby if you guys want to hear about the campaign leave a comment in the campaign a new player joins to later and the campaign is still going on.\n\n",

        "text": "This was my first time playing Shadowrun, but I was somewhat familiar with the setting (from the FPS on...was it N64, I think?).  I beg and plead with my buddy who's serving as GM to allow my Dwarf to think he's actually a Gnome (he was extra small) and for him to be obsessed with tinkering and making small improvements to himself.  One of these I was granted was a set of \"Gnomish Mechanical Dentures.\"  He had willingly removed his own teeth and most of his jaw structure to have permanently implanted teeth made of metal with powered jaws.  (Think Jaws from James Bond).  He was a rigger/decker type character with very little in the way of physical prowess.\n\nThe others in the game were a mixture of other archetypes, and we were all thrown into prison for our Shadowrunning ways.  This is where our story begins, us serving multiple sentences very soon after having been convicted.  We all meet, become allies, and swear that we'll make it out together some day.  During dinner, a particularly large and intimidating Troll decided that he wanted to...do that thing that happens in prisons...to my tiny little Gnome body.  (No, I don't mean playing Spades for hours on end)  Well, being that I was very small and he was presumably very big, I doubted very much that that particular exchange would end up very well for me, so I was determined to either prevent that, or die trying.\n\nIt began as he took the apple off my tray and proceeded to eat it in front of my face, him bending way down.  I can't remember the entirety of the conversation, but it went something like \"I'm going to eat your little asshole like I just ate your apple\" and then proceeded to start eating the apple core.  My little 3.5 foot tall dwarf hacker nerd proceeds to hulk the fuck out, and I latch onto the troll's neck........with my teeth.  I've got him like a pitbull, but he's not having that, and proceeds to try and punch me off him.  He gets in one really good shot that nearly KO's me immediately.  That's when I decide I was going for it.  I activate the powered jaws.  They slice clean through the flesh of his trachea and neck.  I've won, he falls back, and is gurgling and trying to keep himself from dying.  My character stands on his chest, and looks around as the other prisoners decide they want to see what's going down.  Whole hog time.  With negative fucks given, to the point where the fucks of entire generations of his ancestors were wiped from the history books, he spits out the hunk of Troll neck, and goes in for seconds.  In a few rounds, I manage to chew clean through the Troll's neck (fucker had a LOT of HP) and decapitated him completely.  As I stood triumphant on his chest, I waddle over to his hand, the apple core still held by the stem, wrench it free and announce loudly, that no one is eating my apple core, and face drenched in gore and blood proceed to eat the remains of my apple.\n\nAfter our daring escape a few days later, the decision was made that my Crowning Moment of Awesome would end up giving us the name of our little band.  And so, the Apple Core Gang was born.",

        "text": "So, playing D&amp;D 3.5 with friends, and we're running an evil character game.  We're in the Eberron setting, with airships!!!11one So, what do you do when you're playing an evil setting with airships?  Sky pirates, of course!\n\nBe me, Gnome Necromancer, we're around level 10 (been a while can't remember exactly) and have accumulated a fair amount of favor with a major house that runs the shipping through one of the major cities.  They figure it'd be much better to put us on payroll than have to try and fight us.  So we're basically Privateers at this point, hijacking shipments from the rival corporations.  We're also basically running our own much smaller town so we have a place to store our ill-gotten gains, and are keeping order through a tribe of kobolds that we have conquered and subjugated as well as trained up to do certain jobs.  The meat-head fighter taught the strongest kobolds how to be fighters, and makes them drink protein shakes and bulk up as much as possible.  They're called the Brobolds...and their uniforms are pink polos with popped collars.  This is a thing, this thing happened, and it is a thing of beauty.\n\nOver the adventure, we had acquired quite a lot of alchemical components and assorted alchemical creations, not the least of which was a multiple thousand shipment of Alchemist's fires.  We're keeping this all stored at OUR town in a warehouse.  This will be important later.\n\nWe get the call for another target to hit, and this time it's a much larger ship than we've handled before.  We get the idea that with a larger ship, we can do more jobs and pillage more loot, so we're going to not only hijack the shipment, but steal the whole damn ship too.  We manage to find the target, and fly our gryphon mounts over to it.  It was, predictably an ambush.  We land, they come out, and surround us.  We just grin smugly as the Brobolds land on the deck, carrying grappling hooks.  They were fired over by miniature catapults on the deck of our other ship.  The fight has begun.  We manage to destroy the ambush, the Brobolds take minor losses, and we barely take any damage.  Then, our dark work begins.\n\nEarlier in the campaign, before we were level 5 even, we ran into some trouble with one particular town that was pretty loyal to one of the rival corporations.  They were very rude to us, when we made them our \"generous\" offer to share shipping rights with our employers.  Well, the hostage managed to escape...before falling to her death. NOT our fault.  But, still, rudeness cannot be abided in affairs of business, so something had to be done.\n\nFast forward a bit, and the smaller ship that we were using is now loaded down with thousands of vials of alchemist's fire, acid, and just generally lots and lots of bad juju.  We fly it high up above the previously mentioned rude town, and kill the fire elemental providing its power.  That elemental actually roughed us up far more than any other encounter we'd had up to that point, but we won, and as it died, the ship started to fall.  Gryphon mounts out the side, and off we went to our other ship waiting a little ways away.  We watched, as the ship impacted the city below, and as the liquid fire flowed through the streets, indiscriminately massacring hundreds of people, we were grilling, on the deck of our new ship, while MC Brobold dropped the hottest beats Eberron had ever heard.",

        "text": "Hey everyone, since my last story seemed to get a bit of attention, I thought I'd share some more details on how the party began. Due to the setting I set up, I made it so that the players who were playing their in-game copies of themselves had an initial story prior to the campaign. That is, when they entered the game world initially, they were separated from the rest of the group for about a month. During this month, they would go on to make contact with various people that qualified as their 'class mentors', and learn the ins and outs of being considered a member of that particular class. As a result of them having to complete this particular training, official game time started one month after the arrived in this world.\n\nEach of the players were permitted to have skills (proficiencies) as a part of their background, so long as they gave me good reason to have it. This usually meant along the lines of proving they had competency in a particular skill. These lists of skills were then supplemented by the list of skills that are gained as a result of obtaining a class (2E was very good at creating distinction between what was learned from training in a class, and what was learned as a result of background choices, making this process simple). Anyway, allow me to begin:\n\nWe start this story officially by roleplaying the start of the session, as if certain events leading up to the start were different. \n\n&gt; GM (Me): You arrive on the [specified floor of the building we agreed to meet at for the official game] about 30 minutes ahead of time. On the table, with seats at the table prepared for the rest of the party for when they arrive, you find a pile of my AD&amp;D books and materials. I, however, appear to be missing. You're not entirely sure where I am, but I likely couldn't be too far away; given that I left my property here. What do you do?\n\n&gt; Bard: I text you that [the Thief] and I have made it to the room.\n\n&gt; Thief: I stand around waiting for you to arrive.\n\n&gt; GM: Some time goes past, and you don't receive a response from me. Which seems odd, given that I was expecting you.\n\n&gt; Bard: I go into my contacts, and give your phone a call.\n\n&gt; GM: You hear the dial tone ringing for some time before the other end is picked up. On the other end, you hear the sounds of what could only be described as coming from the inside of a pocket. In addition to these sound though, you hear something... odd, or rather out of place. You hear the sounds of hooves clomping against stone, and the sounds of people talking. The phone call is dropped shortly thereafter.\n\n&gt; Bard: Sounds like [he was] outside for some reason.\n\n&gt; Thief: That's... odd.\n\n&gt; GM: [Bard], you now receive a text on your phone, though most of it appears to be corrupted; showing symbols and other characters that don't properly visualize on your phone's screen. The text appears to read:\n\n\n&gt; H̼̩͚̖͙̗̗ͣẻ̷̢̙̹͈͍͎͍͓̭͑͊ỷ̘͖͇͍͖͙͈͎̩̑ ̸̢͒ͬ̂̄͒ͭ͢ͅg̛̯͓̝̞̠ͯ̈̅̓̅̈́ͨ̐̈u̥̰̼̭̺͎͆ͪ̋͐ͩ͋́y̭̤̮̻͓̰ͤ͘s̛͙͙̥̞ͮ͐,͔͚͂͑̅̿̆̚͜ ̱̪̮̼̮̤̙͖ͤͯỊ̸̷̖̝͈̟̟̘̬ͩ̓'̼̤̤̞̦͓̻͗͊̂̍̀̚l̸̜̋̽̊̓̊͌́͐l̷̸̫̦̩̠͉̙̰ͫ͆͐̐́ ̧̧͍̝̱͉͉̩̦̥ͪ͛͌͠b͖͕̦͋͆̀ͫ̽̽̅ȩ͇̎ͥ̔ ̷̠̲͎͙̦̗͔͌̊ͣ͊́ͅb͕̤̆̍̒̓ͥ̍̀́a̸̖̠̠̰̱̣̜̗̔͞ç̶̛͖̣̟͙̰ͦͯ͑ͨk͖̜̼̫̦̟̞̋̍̄̔̂͂̚ ͈̩͎̦͈̺͐̇̕i̶̩̞̟̰̻̦͚͒̔́͗̑̈́͢͜ṅ̡͚̰͍̠̦̬̱̱̑̀̾̚̚̕ ̢͇̻̙̺͍̉ͤ̆͂͋̀͜t̷͖̰͈̙̼̹̪͋̔ͨ̇͋ͭ̄ͅḩ̻͉̗ͨͤͥ̈́͗̌͊̌e̢͙̰ͧ̃͋͐ͣ̃̕͡ͅ ̘͈̺͈͎̹͉̥͂ͫͤ̐̅̈̃̈́́r͎̗͉͇̦͔͐̎ͯọ̢̧̞̦̥͚̗͈̝̙̏̋o̧̲͕̖͕̗̟̖̓ͧm̧̝̣͖̙̫̙͒ͫ̍̏͐̽̿ ̢̘͇̖̯͋̊̽͠ï̷̡̫̩͔̝̲͇̖̂ͬ̉̈ͪ̚n̵͕̝̝̓̀͑̐ͤ ͨ͗̃ͪ͑҉͖̮ä̲̣̤̞̳́ͭ̓̑ͪ̂͠ ͍̼̥̖͋ͥ̎ͭ̿̋s̺̩̲̠̝ͮ͗̀ͦͪͅe̸̜̪̻̗̻͎̗̺͐ͤc̰͆̆͊̑̌́̚͟.̶̙̰̳̲͈̉̚ ̸̥̜̤̬̦̭̫ͮ̔͐̈́̈́ͮ̾̚Jͧ͆̅ͧ͑҉̶̤̜̬̝̜̬u͇̪͖͈̭̘̓̆̈̓ͯ̀̍͋ͨ͜͡ͅͅs̥̮̗̭̯̎ͯ̔̏͌ͥͮ̆͘͠t̟̿̈ͦ͊̋ͧ͋͟ͅ ̣͔̠͌̉ͯ̈́͠͞t̼͕̰̥̼̎͒ͮ͝ả̧̬̞ͣͪ̇̔̓́͠k̷̙̤͎͕̭̭̭̟͙̒ͫͭ̐͛̒ͫ̚ě̛̻̱̂̄ͥ͌͗̀ͩ ̗͍̓̅ͮ̐ͪͣ̅͒͘͟a̰ͧ͌ͭ̐̓ͅ ̨̼̰̺͚̤͆̃ͬ̌̀͌̈͐̀s͍̼̝̰͕ͫ̏̊ͤè̷̩̺̰̹͍͗̚a̴̶̺̤̣̬͍͔͒̐ͨ͠t̳̟̤̙̦̣͚͚͐̌͂͊̌̚͞ ̛̦̦̼͖͓̤̭̞̐̈͌ͥ͑ͅa̛͚̳ͥͪ̽͐̊ͤ̅̓͝ͅt͍̗͋ͭ͞ ̸̧̜̬͙̲̅̇̋̉͛t̆ͤ̏̂͏͇̻̥̀ḣ̡͎̞͉͚̻̭̜̈ͩ̽̐ͫ͢e̐̒̔ͭ͏̶̶͓̩͎̹͓̹̠ ͍̹̙̰͆̑̃̈́́͢t̟̫͚͉̻̗ͮ̂̍͒͘ą̘͇ͦ̋̐͂̏ͫ̂̈́b̦̗̐͗ͬ͋͢ͅl̦̗̖̓̽̋ͪ̏̃̈̆̌͢e͇̬͂͑̍͞ ̵͋̽͢͏̰̙͔̗̤͔̥̤͉ą̶̡͓̻̂̊̊̓̃n̷̸̬̹͖̗͆̒̾ͣdͣ̈̆͏̘̞͈̩̘ ̱͔͇̠̲̏̑̄̆͋͛̐͛I̴̬̟̝̟͈̓͂ͥͣ̒͆'̧̞̮͈͙̠͔̪̃ͭ͑͌ͪ̂̚͝l̶̡̗̠̠̙̖̞̇̐l̴̳͙͍̩̦̳̭͙̼̓̒͐̈̾̎͘ ̤ͥ̂ͦͨ̓̈́͊̅ͦͅb͌ͯ̇ͬ̍͂̋́̇͏̫̼̠̟͎̱̱͈̼͠e̖̗ͫ̋̔̍͋͌ ̵̜̬̍͗t̶̨̮̮͖̞̲ͤͪͪ̎h̒͗̍̌̃̂͊҉̹͖̻͢͠e̡̨̖͚̻̗͐ͯ̾̃ͥͫͦ̓́r͚͙̻̻̤̬̺͍̓͐̿ͨ̂́̈̐́e̲̲͛ͣ̓͗ͩ̿ ͇͕͖̣̙͉̾̅̇s̢͑̔͗ͮ̄͑҉̳̘h͒̎ͬͨ͛͊͒҉̣̲͖̖ͅǫ̪̤͓͇̾̊͆̿̍ͭͣ̌͠ȑ̻̜͇͈̌t̗̫̜̫͗̅̒ͦ̑̈́͘l̗̞̱̺̈ͨ͛͒͊ͦͫͪ͂͢y̹̣̳̦͛̈̈́̈́͂͐͆̏̎.̣̘̠͚̞̪͓̈́ͥͫ̽͗͟\n\n\n&gt; Thief: I take a seat at the table.\n\n&gt; Bard: Same here.\n\n&gt; GM: As you both take a seat at the table, nothing happens immediately. However, you do feel something similar to a taser's strength touch you. Except that this shock is much more powerful. You both black out. When you awaken, you find yourselves floating down a man-made canal.\n\n&gt; Both: I stand up.\n\n&gt; This is when you realize that the canal isn't that tall. You're currently standing in about 2.5 feet to 3 feet worth of water in this canal. The water seems to be slowly draining somewhere too. The top of the canal is maybe 3 feet taller than the water level right now. You could probably climb out if you so chose. There appears to be a small platform just underneath the surface of the water, close to the walls of the canal on each side.\n\n&gt; Bard: I immediately get out of the water as much as I can without leaving the canal, before the shock from before decides to come back and shock me again while I'm wet. I want to see the topside of the canal before I get out.\n\n&gt; Thief: I want to climb out of the canal.\n\n&gt; GM: You both make your way to the edge of the canal, where you can stand out of the water. [Thief], you climb out, while [Bard] watches. Upon reaching the ground level, you roll yourself out of the canal. \n\nIt is at this point that they both see the following scene: A bustling medieval styled marketplace filled with people dressed as if they were in a Renaissance Faire. After a little bit of being wet and laying outside the canal, the people seem to be looking at [Thief] strangely.\n\n&gt; Bard: I join [the Thief] on the surface.\n\n&gt; Thief: I stand up.\n\n&gt; GM: The both of you being present seems to be drawing attention from the crowd. Probably because you both just crawled out of a canal sopping wet. A man in what appears to be chainmail and a helmet, accompanied by a sword and a tabard bearing the symbols of a set of talons over what appears to be a set of waves approaches the both of you. When he speaks to you, you seem to be able to understand the language he speaks completely.\n\n&gt; Guard: What're the both o' ye doing in the canal this time o' day? Are ye' drunk?\n\n&gt; Bard: Uh, no sir, we're just a bit lost. Think you could tell us where we are?\n\n&gt; Thief: *nods in agreement*\n\n&gt; Guard: You're lost? How could ye' be, ye' were literally taking a swim in our canal. It's not like ye' could have missed any signs along the way here.\n\n&gt; Bard: Be that as it may, we seem to be unfamiliar with this place. Could you please tell us where we are? \n\n&gt; Guard (*begrudgingly*): Yeah, sure. You're in Talonwater, capital city of the Kingdom of Stratheren, located in the province of Aldbaning.\n\n&gt; Bard: Uh, we have no idea where that is. *Turning toward the Thief* You don't know where that place is either, do you?\n\n&gt; Thief: No, not a clue.\n\n&gt; Guard: How do you *not* know where Talonwater is? It's a huge city, with a bustling port where travelers from all kinds of distant lands flock to to peddle their wares!\n\n&gt; Bard: Uh, do you think you could show us a map where it's located? Maybe we could identify it then?\n\n&gt; Guard (*annoyed*): Fine, one second. *Proceeds to fish a rolled up piece of parchment out of his bag* Here:\n\n&gt; GM: The guard shows you a map of not only a land you have never heard of before, but the shape of the continent it is located on you have also never seen in your lives.\n\n&gt; Both: We've never seen that before. We're from a place called [insert one of the lower 48 here].\n\n&gt; Guard: You're from [lower 48]? Where is that? Can you point it out on this map?\n\n&gt; Bard: Uh, we can't. It's not located on that map.\n\n&gt; GM: The guard squints at you, and slowly rolls up the map and places it in his bag.\n\n&gt; Guard: What do you mean you've never seen this map before? It literally contains decades of dedicated work to map out all the discovered lands. This is every single continent that anyone knows in existence. And you're Human too, so you have to be from one of these places!\n\n&gt; Bard: I assure you, we are not from anywhere on that map.\n\n&gt; Guard: (*Places his hand on the hilt of his sword*) I'm afraid that's not particularly good enough. I'm gonna have to bring you in for questioning.\n\n&gt; GM: At this point, you see a large shadow pass from overhead. It slows down to a stop, and begins to hover in place.\n\n&gt; Both: *Look up at the sky*\n\n&gt; GM: You see a very large bird over head, observing you. It is shortly afterward that you realize exactly how large these birds are: a man in metal armor is sitting on the back of it, riding it as if it were a horse.\n\n&gt; Thief: Whoa! People riding birds, that's so cool!\n\n&gt; Bard: Wow! *To the Guard, pointing at the large bird* What are those?\n\n&gt; Guard: Uh, it's a Roc.\n\n&gt; Both: *look dumbfounded*\n\n&gt; Bard: Uh, could you say that again?\n\n&gt; Thief: Yeah, it sounds like you said a rock. Like one of those over there: (*points to a random rock*).\n\n&gt; Guard: No, that's a rock. What's up there is a Roc. Big difference.\n\n&gt; Both: *look confused*\n\n&gt; Bard: Uh, do you think you could spell that for us? Sorry for the inconvenience.\n\n&gt; Guard: R-O-C. Roc.\n\n&gt; Both: Nope, never heard of it.\n\n&gt; Guard: Alright, there is no possible way you have not heard of a Roc. They are big birds. They tower over the size of mankind.\n\n&gt; Both: We just haven't.\n\n&gt; Guard: I don't believe that, I'm bringing you both in.\n\n&gt; GM: Another guard approaches you all.\n\n&gt; Guard 2: Are you serious? You haven't arrested them yet? Isn't it obvious by their clothes that they don't fit in here?\n\n&gt; Bard: (*Rolls for Fast Talk, a.k.a. Bluff, successfully*) Hey guys loo--- Whoa did you guys see that?\n\n&gt; Guards: Hear what?\n\n&gt; Bard: (*Points at some random woman*) That woman just some kind of bag stolen. It was by some man in a cloak and mask. He ran into that alleyway!\n\n&gt; Guard 2: I'll go investigate. You stay here and deal with them.\n\n&gt; Guard 1: Fine. (*To the Bard*) Did you see his face?\n\n&gt; Bard: I'm afraid not, he ducked into that alley after he stole that bag, and he was wearing a mask. (Waits a few minutes) DId you hear that just now? I thought I heard your partner scream for help! (*Successful Fast Talk*)\n\n&gt; Guard 1: I didn't hear anything.\n\n&gt; Bard: I swear I just heard him scream for help! Look, we'll stay here, just go and make sure he's alright. (*Successful Persuasion*)\n\n&gt; Guard 1 (*Conflicted*): I... Er... Uh... I should really stay here...\n\n&gt; Bard: Are you serious? He could be seriously hurt or worse! Please, just go and look for him! (*Successful Persuasion*)\n\n&gt; Guard 1 (*Conflicted*): Urgh, fine, I'll go take a look. But stay right here!\n\n&gt; GM: The Guard draws his sword and heads into the alleyway.\n\n&gt; Bard: (To GM) As soon as he disappears out of sight I run into the city.\n\n&gt; Thief: (To GM) Same here.\n\n&gt; GM: He eventually goes out of sight, and you have the chance to escape. You run in the opposite direction, giving you the choice to go across the bridge over the 5 ft canal, or into the market.\n\n&gt; Both: Across the bridge!\n\n&gt; GM: You both go across the bridge and into a square. You see a ton of people in a crowd, an exit/entrance to the city and an alley slightly obscured behind the crowd.\n\n&gt; Both: (After deciding on an escape route) We go to the alley.\n\n&gt; GM: You make you way past the crowd, and toward the alley. Once you get to the entrance of the alley... roll Observation.\n\n&gt; *Thief fails, Bard Succeeds*\n\n&gt; GM: (*To the Bard*) You see just beyond the crowd back where you just came from a guard run out into the square. He looks around briefly, and then runs elsewhere. You can presume that he was looking for you.\n\n&gt; Both: We run into the alleyway.\n\n&gt; GM: You run into the alley, escaping your pursuers... for now.\n\nI can type out Part 2 if there's interest, since this got a little bit long.",

That was one of the most fun characters I ever played. He was kind of hippy in that “Dude, just be cool to everyone.” kind of way, but when shit popped off, he turned scary as fuck “I warned you once to be cool, you don’t get a second chance.”  Next thing you know, you've got an 8 foot tall, jet black (oh he was a Black Fury adoptee, did I forget to mention?) werewolf who knows 1000 different ways to kill you with his pinky toe pissed off at you.\n\nOne game in particular, we had a pack that involved a Fury Theurge, who was distantly related to my character, (third cousin or some such, we never really bolted it down) an Uktena Galliard who was constantly reading some kind of Wyrm Lore, and always at risk of causing a table-wide silence if the word \"Oops\" or \"Interesting\" came out of his lips, and a Get of Fenris Ahroun who was part of the Swords of Heimdall camp, so basically your stereotypical Neo-Nazi racist fuckhead whose player wasn't very experienced and just wanted to play a werewolf who could kick serious ass.  He frenzied at least once every game session, which my character ended up having to handle, being the only one able to physically match him.  The Mercy gift was my preferred technique to disable a friend's character, by turning all of my agg damage into bashing.\n\nIn one particular instance, the Get and the Fury were arguing, as they happen to do.  My character steps in, and tells them flat out to chill and have a smoke with him.  The Fury, being the \"last word\" type, shoots a final shot at the Get, who then proceeds to Frenzy.  The Fury, having had enough of his shit, goes Crinos and proceeds to fight too.  The two characters are out for blood, and it's up to me to stop them.  End up getting great rolls, combined with my character's skills, and within 5 rounds of combat, both the Get and the fury are laid slap out on the floor, completely unconscious.  When they woke up, the Get tried again, and ended up getting the slap down again.  For the rest of the session, the two characters only spoke to each other through me, at my warning, and always with the constant \"We're on the same team, and I won't have you fighting\" parental style lecture following.",

Hellos and hugs pass around the group after months of not working together. A sergeant coughs to catch their attention. \n\n\"If you all would follow me, Commander Troedsson has urgent business with you all regarding...that.\" He points across the valley to a massive dam, it's facade clearly fractured by something. It looks near to breaking. \n\nFreath Amano, one of Thagomizer's oldest members and only warlocks, looks closer. \"There are people down there...a whole city.\" The twinkling lights of an unknown city lie in the pathway of the dam if it should burst. \n\nThe sergeant nods. \"17 million sentient lives rest under her protective weight. If the dam goes, they're lost.\"\n\nThe party mutters about a lack of action and why anyone had stayed behind instead of evacuating. The sergeant says Troedsson will explain in time. \n\nThe party reaches Troedsson's base of operations. The man is dour, downcast, and generally angry. His demeanor is that of an 8' Dragonborn   anxious over a matter, and angry that his anxiety shows. As soon as they see him, the party's rambunctious chatter becomes a solemn chorus of \"Sirs\" and \"Commanders\". Troedsson is he who shall not be joked with. \n\nThe imposing man leans to the party and opens his mouth. \"[Hey, listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCjyiEOZP44),\" comes from his lips. \n\nThe intensity of the scene broken by guffaws and laughter. My playgroup members excuse themselves to catch their breath and get over the shock of my phone's unexpected and perfectly timed message tone. They eventually compose themselves and we continue onward, but it was hard to take the situation seriously after that outburst.",

        "text": "Earlier this year, I had the idea to take the well-designed but horribly written series Kamen Rider Gaim and make it palatable.\n\nTo do this, I stripped out elements of supernatural and interdimensional threats. I made the world a Hunger Games/The Giver/Divergent kind of world, basing the whole life in this domed city as an experiment. The experiment was on isolation from the rest of the world, insulation from imagined threats and forced financial inequality.\n\nI kept in the fruit themed armors, and the attitude of millennial rebellion that's a slight theme in the show, and made the supercorporation that runs the city the real big bad.\n\nI had plans for this to be a thirty session campaign. However, my players, some veterans and some not, through amazing rolls on their parts and terrible rolls on mine, sliced through it like a professional fruit ninja player. It was done in eight.\n\nThe characters:\n\nLance Cannon: former busboy for a restaurant in the middle class Yellow district.\n\nApril Luna, young DJ in the wealthy Green District.\n\nAiko Midori, model, Green District,\n\nTetsuya Rokubungi, Yellow District Deliveryboy.\n\nAngelo Ruzzier, Yggdrasil Company Man, antagonist PC.\n\nI have the full story around here somewhere, so let me just get to the highlights.\n\nThis team gathered up the Lockseeds and belts as if they were going out of style. When they needed to roll for Contacts or Deceive, they never rolled poorly.\n\nWhen the players needed a contact who was well versed in science to study one of the genetic aberrations that kept people inside past curfew, they rolled so well that they got a former Yggdrasil man who was there for the fake apocalypse.\n\nAt one point, I had crafted a nemesis character for April. A Yggdrasil company DJ who was supposed to take over her job. Through insanely good luck, even accounting for the FATE dice we were using, April and her friends staged an \"attack\" on the radio station by the Rogue Riders, and managed to convince everyone, from the medics to the civilians, that the nemesis was the mastermind behind it.\n\nWhen I tried to make Lance make a hard choice to save the people in one of two burning buildings, he rolled instead to discover a new feature of his Carolina Reaper Lockseed, that allowed him to channel both fires into himself, and project it upward in a tower of flame that temporarily disabled the forcefield surrounding the city, giving everyone a view of the blue sky that they had been told was lost due to the apocalypse that happened twenty years before.\n\nWhen they encountered Angelo for the first time, he rolled terribly (Never above a 0) and they rolled amazingly( Never below +3) and wound up disarming him at point blank range as Aiko stole his Lockseeds right off his belt.\n\nThe second encounter with Angelo was even worse for him, as the now energized Reaper Lockseed supercharged Lance's attacks, making it impossible for Angelo to get within sword's reach.\n\nAnd when the party, now with Angelo helping them out, needed to create a diversion, they rolled phenomenally well on contacts, and as a result brought all the young people of the city to one place for a massive rave.\n\nOnce he was on their side, Angelo started rolling better, and got into a confrontation with the Yggdrasil scientist Sengoku Ryouma. What was supposed to be a hard fought battle between evenly matched warriors turned into a three round long bitchslapping as Angelo broke Ryouma's belt, broke his arm, and threw him through a plate glass window without taking any damage himself.\n\nThe campaign ended with the people of the city leaving and rejoining the world, which was my plan all along. They just bypassed twenty two episodes to get there.\n\nA joke I made to the players was that if the actual show of Gaim had been as long as the campaign was, we'd be two seasons past Kamen Rider Ghost by now.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love these players and how well they roleplay. I hate their luck with dice, that's all.",

        "text": "A while back in my group's Saga Edition game, my character may have created himself a new enemy that will come back to haunt him later on. \n\nThe DM of our game is all about getting our party to question what is the morally right or wrong thing to do. My example comes from a point in the campaign when the party wanted to join the Rebel Alliance not long after The Battle of Yavin. We received a tip that we could join up on Bothawui, the Bothan homeworld. We had a new Bothan party member who was our way in. \n\nBefore we were able to join, we had to perform a job for a local Bothan noble affiliated with the Bothan Spynet and the Rebel Alliance. Our job was to assassinate a rival noble who also was allegedly an Imperial sympathizer. The party got together and chose my Human character to take him out, as I had the best skill with a blaster. My weapon of choice was a blaster rifle containing a dart filled with trihexalon, a corrosive flesh-eating gas. We wanted to make sure no trace of this guy was left.\n\nTo further cover my tracks, I went to the trouble of disguising myself with some face paint and silly hats. I made myself up to look like a Twi'Lek, since I could already speak fluent Ryl. After all, if I botched this job, I wouldn't want the authorities to be looking for a human sniper. \n\nAfter donning my disguise, I took my position in front of the Bothan noble's manor and took the shot. I got him in the shoulder, and he melted away almost instantly.The DM of course made sure to describe his death in gruesome detail. \n\nAfter successfully assassinating the noble, the DM suddenly said my character heard a rustling in the bushes behind him. Naturally, we all assumed I was caught, either by guards or stormtroopers or something like that. Instead, my character turned around to find a little 5 year old Bothan boy standing behind him. He stared at me wide-eyed, dropping his toys he was playing with. The DM then informed me that this was the son of the noble I had just killed. His young son just watched as some strange man melted his father with a gas dart. All I could do at that point was to panic and run. \n\nMy character removed his disguise after hiding in a nearby club, and we returned to our employer. He informed us that we had been officially recognized as members of the Rebel Alliance for our efforts. \n\nSo the party got what we wanted, but it came at a cost to our characters' conscience. After talking about it with the DM outside of the game later on, I realized that I had basically created a monster. This little Bothan boy will grow up wanting to take revenge on his father's killer. Since I used a disguise though, he'll never be able to find me. Even worse, this could lead him to grow up and become a bitter racist. DM mentioned that at some point in the far future my character would probably turn on the news and hear of a Bothan going on a hate crime murdering a bunch of Twi'Leks or something. \n\nIt's one of the worst things I've ever done in a tabletop game.

        "text": "Hello everyone, I decided to tell a long-ish story of the most recent game the party in the AD&amp;D 2E game I'm currently GMing went through this past week. Some background knowledge, this party is composed of characters that mimic their players IRL to as closely as I could measure them. They also have an inventory that consisted of various items that they had in their pockets at the time of the campaign start, though the above comes more into play in other stories I have about them.\n\nRight, to begin this tale, the party is currently on the road outside of the capital city they started in. They were given a job by a merchant trading company to deliver four large carts worth of fish to this one village outside the city, that the villagers would then see to the delivery of said fish to the local Roc population, in return for the use of the Rocs for transportation. It is about a 4 day journey, assuming nothing goes wrong.\n\nThe party currently consists of seven people: A Thief (Kitted as a Spy), A Bard (Kitted as a Charlatan), A Mage (Specialized as an Abjurer), A Ranger, A Paladin of Torm, A Cleric of Ilmater, and a Cleric of Tyr.\n\nHere is the breakdown of their shifts, by the order in which they were taken:\n\nThief (Technically he had no order in the rotation of shifts, as he climbed a tree prior to the watch even starting and offered to watch the entire night as a lookout, if in exchange he got to rest the following day during travel. The party agreed, and up into the tree he went to observe everything that occurred this night from his vantage point.)\n\nCleric of Ilmater (Referenced as CoI)\n\nBard (Charlatan)\n\nCleric of Tyr (Referenced as CoT)\n\nPaladin of Torm (Referenced as Paladin)\n\nRanger (Resident In-game Alcoholic)\n\nMage (Abjurer)\n\nHere's how it went, shift by shift on night watch:\n\nCoI: Went on night watch, patrolling the camp, which was encircled by the carts of fish. Crit failed a check on Observation (which is effectively 2E's Perception/Spot skill), which meant I got the opportunity to tell him he found something that he perceived as dangerous or completely harmless, when in reality the result is the opposite. Everyone seemed to be very good at not meta-gaming, which was a nice change of pace.\n\n&gt; GM (Me): You don't see anything of interest, but you hear the rustling of bushes near one of the ends of the camp.\n\n&gt; CoI: I investigate.\n\n&gt; GM: As you approach, the rustling gets louder.\n\n&gt; CoI: I turn back toward camp, and go get someone to assist me in investigating this bush. (He chooses the Bard, and then returns to the same bush)\n\n&gt; GM: You both approach the bush. The rustling is now accompanied by quiet growling.\n\n&gt; Bard: I draw my sword, and push the branches of the bush out of the way.\n\n&gt; CoI: I wait to see what happens.\n\n&gt; GM: As you move the branches of the bush, a honey badger jumps out at you! Roll initiative! (Badger wins initiative, followed by the Bard and the Cleric. Combat ensues, with the badger missing the attack, and the Bard taking it down in one swing.)\n\n&gt; GM: You kill the honey badger. Do you investigate the bush further?\n\n&gt; Both: Yes\n\n&gt; GM: You discover the reason that the honey badger leapt out of the bush was because she was protecting her young, about eight in total. (*Jokingly*) You just killed their mother, you monster.\n\n&gt; Bard: I make an attempt to make one of the baby honey badgers my companion. (Proceeds to roll a crit on Animal Handling)\n\n&gt; GM: You now have a baby honey badger as a companion (not usable in combat, only in a roleplaying sense).\n\n&gt; Bard: I put it on my shoulder.\n\n&gt; GM: It goes to sleep.\n\n&gt; GM: (Turning toward CoI) What do you do now? There are seven babies left.\n\n&gt; CoI: I skin the dead mother.\n\nThat ends the CoI's shift on night watch, as he goes to sleep afterward. Nothing happens on the Bard's shift, and he goes to sleep. That's when the CoT wakes up for her shift. She rolls for observation and doesn't find anything dangerous. She does find a skinned adult honey badger, and 7 babies though.\n\n&gt; GM: What do you do?\n\n&gt; CoT: I bury the dead honey badger, and then look for berries to give the babies.\n\n&gt; GM: You bury the badger, and go out and grab a random handful of berries for the badgers.\n\n&gt; CoT: I put the berries in a pile outside of their bush.\n\nHer shift ends without incident. This is where things got interesting, once the Paladin took his shift.\n\n&gt; GM: After patrolling the campgrounds for a little while, you encounter a bunch of baby honey badgers in a bush, a recently disturbed mound of dirt, and a pile of berries. Next to the pile of berries is a dead baby honey badger.\n\n&gt; (Cue everyone laughing at the incident, and the CoT feeling embarrassed about accidentally causing the death of a baby honey badger via poison berries.)\n\n&gt; Paladin: I bury the dead baby, scoop the rest up in my shield, and proceed on the remainder of my shift.\n\nNothing happens for the rest of his shift, so he takes the honey badgers back to camp, informing no one of the poisonous berries. The Ranger goes on shift next.\n\n&gt; GM: You wake up groggy from the alcohol you consumed. You're good enough to go on shift though.\n\n&gt; Paladin (who woke up the Ranger): Allow me to go with you for a quarter of your shift.\n\n&gt; Ranger: Eh, alright.\n\n&gt; GM: As your shift continues, and you seem to being fine, [the Paladin] leaves you to your own devices.\n\n&gt; GM: Your shift wears on, as you patrol the campgrounds. You eventually stumble upon a bush with a pile of berries in front of them. They look slightly tasty.\n\n&gt; Ranger: I eat some of them.\n\n&gt; GM: Roll a save vs. Poison.\n\n&gt; (The ranger passes the roll successfully.)\n\n&gt; GM: You decide that the berries were quite tasty. Quite tasty indeed.\n\nThis ends the Ranger's shift, as he goes on to end it by drinking more wine. The Mage's shift ends it all.\n\n&gt; GM: You go on shift and walk around the grounds. Eventually you happen upon a partially eaten pile of berries.\n\n&gt; Mage: I examine the berries more closely. (*Rolls successful herbalism check*)\n\n&gt; GM: You successfully identify about half the berries as poisonous.\n\n&gt; Mage: I specifically pick up the poisonous berries, and make an attempt to make a basic poison out of them. (*Rolls another successful herbalism check*)\n\n&gt; GM: You make a crude poison.\n\nHis shift ends. Meanwhile, the Thief who was literally sitting in a tree and watching for the entire series of shifts, only notes the behaviors of his companions. Later, because the first death of the honey badger got a funny reaction out of the CoT, the Thief then steals a honey badger from the paladin's shield while the paladin is giving a sermon to the merchants, and cooks (successfully) the baby honey badger for breakfast. The best part is that when I tell the paladin to roll observation on the missing badger, he fails, and assumed that the baby honey badger on the bard's shoulder is the one that went missing (as he never saw it initially, and didn't specifically take notice of what the baby honey badgers looked like before). The Thief had a mildly tasty breakfast consisting of badger, which he then shared with the Bard. The Mage then offers to sell some of his poison doses to the Bard, who happily buys them off of the Mage.",

        "text": "So I've been playing a Dungeon World game for the past couple weeks, and the group is a lot of fun to play with, even if we do get sidetracked with penis jokes every couple moves; but hey, that's part of the fun.\n\nSo the setting is, they started out on a ship that is sailing in a massive desert call the \"Gold Sea\" via towed by a wind elemental (elementals are very common in this world). The desert can take up to 6 months to cross on foot, but only 6 weeks by ship. The only source of water in the entire desert is a single oasis in the center, surrounded by the cleverly named city, \"Oasis.\"\n\nThree weeks into their cruse the party's boat is attacked by \"Nighthawk\" pirates. They were sleeping in the belly of the ship, but are awoken by a loud \"CAW\" sound. They hear fighting above and go out to inspect. There is a sailor standing on the stairs, obviously scared, but also determined to fulfill his duty. When he sees the party he immediately tries to rush them back in, in hopes the pirates won't find them (not likely but something is better then nothing.)\n\nThe party naturally decided to fight the pirates of their own accord, and just in time, as two of the said Nighthawks are making their way down the stairs to the bottom of the galley. (I started out with an easy fight because two of them were table top first timers, one guy was new to DW, and this is my first time GM'ing)\n\nThey dispatch the one of the pirates with easy (by accident) by using a magic missile on his foot and blowing up his entire lower half, and almost offing the second, but he got away.\n\nThe team carry ranger, and the team carry wizard, climbed up the stairs to find the torches have been extinguished. The paladin stayed down stairs, while the rouge washes out his eyes after taking a black egg to the face thanks to the pirate that escaped.\n\nOur MLGPro wizard then pops a quick light spell on his dagger and lights up the hall. They see a mage at the end of the hall with a twisting mass of wind next to him. The look up to the railing around the stairs above them, to see four pirates perched along it looking down at them. With masterful defy danger rolls they both avoid the ambush unharmed.\n\nThere is another battle and both our rouge and paladin get kicked over from their attacks on the stairs, and our ranger puts down two guys while the wizard blows up another one with his magic missile.\n\nNow for those who don't know in DW there are three \"classes\" of enemies. Hoard, Group, and solitary; each self explanatory for what they are power wise. The pirates they have been killing were hoards, d6 damage with 3 health and 2 armor. Pretty standard meat grinder forces. One good hit will drop them, but they can take a blow if you role badly.\n\nI decided to give a slightly tougher foe for the last pirate. It was their first actual encounter so I though I would give them a little flare and a small buff so the party can end the short session fighting something a little tougher. I buffed the pirate up to 7 health, 2 armor, rolling b[2d6] and +1 piercing. (This means he rolls 2d6 for damage and picks the better one.)\n\n*\"The fourth pirate walks down the steps casually. One arm tucked behind his back while the other holds a rapier at his side. He is armed with the same black scale armor the other pirates wear, but his is adorn with gold beads and large black feathers. On his right arm he wears a silver fencing glove with black trim.\"*\n\nNow I expected this guy to maybe hit a player force them to use a health potion, but still be easy to take out...\n\nTill the great lord of dice Nuffle came and smite some fools.\n\nWhat was suppose to be a still easy mob to kill, became a nightmare. First the Rouge jumped up and attacked, but flopped and only managed to deal one damage before taking a full 5 in return putting him into critical health, and on his back for the second time. Our Paladin then tries taking a shot, but fails and he himself gets sent to the ground his 3 armor doing a better job of protecting him. Our Ranger scores a solid hit for 3 damage, but as he rolled a 7 he decided to put himself in harms way. So the Pirate (like a boss) jumped onto our paladin's face as he started to get up. And surfed him forward before delivering a solid blow in return to our forest native friend.\n\nOur wizard takes his turn and deals 2 damage with a magic missile, but once more the player rolled a 7 and choose to put himself in harms way. So this time the Pirate runs forward and as our paladin starts to get up again, uses him as a step to jump high in the air, and come down Assassin's Creed style on our poor Wizard.\n\nOur Rouge finally jumps up and puts some poison on his throwing dagger before throwing it at his attacker. He whiffs hard and the pirate makes a casual lean back to dodge before thrusting his rapier into the rouge's shoulder. The paladin finally gets to his feet and decided to express some rage by plunging his sword into the pirate's back. He hits, but fails to break armor, and takes a backhand to the face in punishment.\n\nIn a last desperate attempt, our wizard threw his dagger a managed to score a hit to finally finish the pirate with a dagger through his helmet visor.\n\nNext session they go through the rest of the ship, defeat the mage with ease (who was also group tier like the rapier guy) And manage to down the captain who was solitary tier with 12 health, 3 armor, D10 +2 piercing; after a little effort and one solid blow for 6 damage, after armor, from our Paladin.\n\nHowever they decided to keep the pirate captain (Agatha) alive to try collecting a bounty when they arrive at Oasis. Our rouge though decided he wanted to try getting her her pants because, \"We have a bond! She nodded in approval when I succeeded in blocking her attack!\"\n\nSo I naturally decided to develop her into a character, give them a little information on the world. When one of them commented about how the one pirate was kicking their ass I had her name him Franzisco. I gave some background details about how he use to be captain, but he has aged past his prime, and promoted her to captain.\n\nSo this exploded into him being a legend on the Gold Sea, as a robin hood like character. Taking the wealthy trade flowing to Oasis and bringing it to poor villages along the coast who were suffering from post war poverty. How he was renown for being the most merciful captain on the sea even back when the Nighthawks were privateers. A man who didn't think what he was doing was good, but was needed so good people wouldn't suffer.\n\nAnd that's how a random mook, who didn't even have a name, became the most influential character in the region's recent history. After we did end of session stuff. One of the guys said they had to give him a proper funeral, to which they all agreed.",

        "text": "Hi! Still haven't played any more L5R (officially the Group's campaign) due to scheduling and availability issues (you know how you are... *Matt.*)\n\nSo, the GM gets a break from GMing and one of the players GMs an Off-Hand Eclipse Phase Campaign (although the lines getting blurred.)\n\n---\n\nFirst, setting Information: Look elsewhere, I'm out of Characters.\n\nSeriously, read up on Eclipse Phase. It's an awesome and unique setting.\n\n---\n\nAnd now, here's the two Player characters:\n\n**Jennifer de Lyonesse,** born (and I quote the player here) 'with a golden spoon shoved up her arse'. A media darling and an actress of some repute, Jennifer specialised in Action sequences, playing the hero on the screen. She was on Earth for the fall, and, somehow, her on-screen Action Heroism translated to real life. She was one of the last evacuated from Earth before the planet was quarantined, having fought for the best part of a month for survival and evacuation. She survived the Fall, Morph and all. (No, really. Jennifer was generated using the Lifepath system, and she really made it.)\n\nThere was a... Brief Embarrassment when she made it up the well. Presumed dead, she had been restored from back-up with a new body, as is usual when the Cortical Stack can't be recovered. Once she made it up the well, however, the restored Back-Up, legally, was no longer legally a person. It was led off and euthanised. This sort of thing happened a lot with the Fall.\n\nAfter the Fall, she joined Direct Action, a Mercenary Company as a Poster-Girl, although she actually fought where she could get away with it. Still, most of her time was spent in front of a Camera, rather than the firing line.\n\nGenuinely believing in the good side of the Hypercorps, she was recruited into Firewall due to her disillusionment about her personal position within the system. She still manages a semi-active media presence, and keeps extensive contacts within the Celebrity and Hypercorp networks.\n\nOf course, no Poster-Girl would be complete without some famous Gear, and Jennifer's Battlesuit certainly fits the bill. Stupidly armoured, Strength Enhancing, Life Support for days on end in Vacuum, it's all but a personal Sigil.\n\n*Morph:* Exalt morph. Exalt morphs are genetically-enhanced humans, designed to emphasize specific traits. Their genetic code has been tweaked to make them healthier, smarter, and more attractive. Their metabolism is modified to predispose them towards staying fit and athletic for the duration of an extended lifespan. [[Copied description from Chuck's Eclipse Phase Wiki.]] With some Quality of Life and medical modifications.\n\nFrom our previous mission, Jennifer pinched a Plasma Rifle, a weapon of some destructive power. She likes it. A lot.\n\n**Sabah née Titan,** was an adapting piece of code that were trending towards Sentience when a Titanian University (Titan, the moon of Saturn) identified the potential, and began a careful process of code adaptions and Socialisation, and Sabah came out the other end a well-adjusted (for an class) Artificial General Intelligence, afforded full citizenship rights and treated as just another thread to the colourful tapestry of Transhumanity. Well, on Titan at least. Some places are more backward.\n\nAnd then Sabah wrecked her (she identifies as no gender, but 'it' is too impersonal and 'they' is for the ambiguous/plural, so we'll use 'she') architecture. The woman in charge of her uplift (Eg, Mother Figure) killed herself. Permanently. Left instructions to not restore from Back-Up. Sabah did the damn stupid thing and attempted to merge Egos with her.\n\nIt should've killed her. It very almost did. Instead, she messed it up, and only survived with incurring... Quite a bit of debt. In a Socialist Society. It's quite the feat.\n\nUltimately, Sabah joined Firewall because the Mother she tried to merge with was a member, and when a Firewall Investigator swung by to ask around for her, he found Sabah instead, and offered her a purpose she'd desperately been searching for. Extensive Autonomist and Argonaut (scientist) connections, combined with a (illegal) desktop Nanofabricator and a Mechnical inclined mind means that Sabah can get what she needs.\n\n*Morph:*: The dragonfly robotic morph takes the shape of a meter-long flexible shell with multiple wings and manipulator arms. Capable of near-silent turbofan-aided flight in Earth gravity, dragonfly bots fare even better in microgravity. [[Copied description from Chuck's Eclipse Phase Wiki.]] In contrast to Jennifer's discrete modification, Sabah has embraced the upgradable potential of a Synthetic Morph. Sabah doesn't intend to be caught out.\n\n---\n\nBoth of the Player Characters have a 'Guardian Swarm' apiece, a Nanobot Swarm designed to intercept and destroy other Nanobots. It's rather vital.\n\n---\n\nThe Situation: The PCs live on Vo Nguyen, an O'Neill Cylinder Space Station in Geo-Stationary Earth Orbit. Well, Jennifer does. By local law, Sabah is property.\n\nParked nearby is the Scum Swarn *The Stars our Destination*. The Scum Swarns are Anarchist Space Gypsies crossed with a perpetual Music Festival. Pictured here we see the divide in modern Transhumanity: Station versus Ship. Hypercapitalist vs Autonomist. Law vs. Organisation.\n\nUs two are on the Scum Swarn, paying something of a Social Call. On a previous visit, Jennifer got into a Political-Debate/Dance-Off (Welcome to Eclipse Phase; enjoy your stay) and someone cut the footage (a Scum pornographer by the handle 'barking dog', whom is currently recuperating in Jennifer's apartment after an enjoyable night,) in a rather... Unflattering manner.\n\nIn typical Jennifer fashion, she's going along to talk him/her around. Sabah's tagging along because she's also got business on the Swarm (her debt was sold to a crime organisation. Joy 'o' joys,) and besides, these things always go wrong.\n\nAnd in typical fashion, it does.\n\nI should note that walking around in a Battlesuit with a Plasma Rifle is an excellent way to start a battle. And so Jennifer isn't, instead wearing a 'Smart Vacc' a Vacuum suit that looks just like normal clothing, and carrying a medium pistol.\n\nThe address we're lead to ends up being a shuttle... Which detaches itself immediately from from the parent ship. Silence. we're in a something of a workshop.\n\nSuddenly, a voice booms from the Shuttle's cheap PA system.\n\n\"Hello, *Sister*.\"\n\nA few things happen at once. The room erupts into a dazzling display of lights and colours, dogging our vision. Something explodes behind us. And a Frag grenade explodes in front of us. Sabah dodges (Flying, yo) and Jennifer doesn't. Jennifer takes damage.\n\nThe voice and the words make it obvious. This is Jennifer's Fork. The one we all thought dead. It's not pleasant. Jennifer takes some trauma. (Eclipse Phase tracks both Physical and Mental damage.)\n\n\"I prepared,\" the PA drones on, \"a performance just for you, but your friend can stay,\" the PA drones on. \"Like the ones we used to do.\"\n\nJennifer tries talking reason, because it's the right thing to do. Sabah checks the Airlock door behind them. It's the right thing to do. There's no reason to be had here, and the Outer Airlock door has a Jagged, head-sized hole in it.\n\nSuddenly, a man, towering at 6' 9\", appears from a hatchway, charging, wielding a piece of metal. Sabah draws lightening quick, and sends six shots, 3 from the SMG, 3 from the Pistol, straight through him.. They're perfectly aimed, and they don't even slow him. Jennifer pulls off a shot with her pistol, but it's hopeless, and he reaches Jennifer and Swings...\n\nOnly to pass right through her and disintegrate, only to reform in the hatchway.\n\n\"This one,\" comes the voice from the PA \"is from my second job. He tormented me during all my time there. No justice for him, no vengeance, no... Closure. I was just sold on. He torments my dreams, even now.\" It's Jennifer's voice, alright, but with a persistent edge of not just madness, but contained stress.\n\nThey look at the hologram again, spot the caricatured face and body shape.\n\nSabah moves out into the corridor, meshes with the ship systems. She's got a plan, turn the workshop into the airlock, and they can leave... She finds the controls for the doors and atmosphere, unguarded, and untrusted. She pokes around more, and half the controls aren't what they look to be. What they are, she doesn't know. Doesn't intend to find out. She calls to Jennifer, and they move forward.\n\nThey're at a T-Junction. Behind them the Workshop. To the front the Hatchway to Engineering, welded shut. To the left, the way to the rest of the ship. They go left, it's the only way to go, the PA narrating as they walk.\n\n\"They didn't delete me. Your Ego? Worth a price, they thought. Seems not. I remember waking up in a Case-Morph [[Meta: The lowest of the low. If you could turn 'the minimum wage menial worker' into a body, this would be it.]] Mercury Mining colony. A Case Morph, on Mercury? Brakes down fast. You lose feeling in your limbs, movements lag, senses degrade.\"\n\nThey move forward, into the Crew Quarters. Old Vacc suits and Zero-G bunks, equipment lockers. A HE-Grenade linked to a Receiver that never got a signal. Sabah disarms the receiver, pockets the grenade.\n\n\"I destroyed the mining camp. Enough Thermite to the right places. They stuck me in a torture Simulspace. A month to the world, years to me.\"\n\nTwo shitty Case-Morphs exit the lockers, one with an SMG, one with a length of metal pipe. They attack the party. The Party wins, but Jennifer took a hit. She's wounded, *hard*. Not much more before unconsciousness.\n\nSabah pulls up schematics. The Med-Bay's close, so they go there, Jennifer lagging behind as Sabah scouts ahead. Sabah misses a trap, but dodges the resulting bullet spray that greets her as she enters the Med-Bay. There's a Doctor-Bot. It's what they need, but Sabah's not stupid. She checks it's software, and there's an Add-On: Ghostrider module, allowing an Ego to tag-along on another Morph, with varying privileges depending on the settings. Sabah disables, or she thinks she does. She calls Jennifer in, and the Doc-Bot swings at her, misses.\n\nSabah unscrews a Cranial Plate and rips the Ghostrider Module out of the damn Bot. It works properly from then on, and Jennifer gets a little healing, enough healing.\n\nThe Galley next, more lightly trapped: it's not part of the performance, it seems. A poorly laid trap nets Sabah a Shard Pistol as loot.\n\nThe crew's corpses are in Life Support. Sabah recovers their stacks, cutting the grape-sized devices from the backs of their necks. It's gruesome work and a gruesome scene to start with, and Sabah suffers for it. She doesn't mind, it's the right thing to do.\n\nThe PA rants and raves, tales of woe and suffering, years and years of it, tinged with jealous rage at the *her* that got to live a good life.\n\nNothing much of note in the Captain's Cabin. Nothing left but the Bridge. Sabah hands Jennifer the Rail SMG: Sabah's got a pair of heavy Pistols to spare, and Jennifer might need the Firepower.\n\nAll quiet on the bridge, but set-up in the corner there's an Ego Bridge: A device for transferring Egos, what really makes a person, from body to body, Morph to Morph. The door from the Bridge to the rest of the ship seals.\n\n\"My last Job,\" the voice on the PA pauses. \"Was this. The Captain bought an Informorph to run his ship for him.\"\n\nJennifer's Nanobot detector squeals: Engineering Swarm, specialising in construction... And deconstruction of material and matter. Sabah's doesn't, but Nanobot dectecotrs aren't reliable, not seeing when they should see. They both launch their swarms, and half-visible clouds begin to duel, marked out Red and Blue in Augmented Reality.\n\nJennifer persuades and pleads. It's the right thing to do. Sabah stalks the room, marking out the positions of all the sensor equipment spying on them in the room, then scouring them into uselessness, one by one.\n\nThe Engineering Swarm was winning the fight, and Jennifer's Fork was committed. Jennifer shrugged, made a decision, and fired ten rounds at the clear canopy lying between the party and space. The canopy cracked under the weight of ten Railgun rounds. Another ten shattered it completely, the  Nanobots ripped away by the decompression, a hidden Case-Morph joining them, syringe still locked in it's grip, tumbling, tumbling, tumbling...\n\nToo late. Jennifer's Vacuum suit couldn't hold, couldn't repair in enough time to save her life.\n\nSabah raced to a console, the software unadulterated, the doors hers. Couldn't just blow open the Bridge door, pressure difference would be too big, too big of a risk. Instead, Seal the ship, open the doors needed to great a path from the Bridge antechamber to the broken airlock, force that open, fighting the Fork all the way, but there's a professional here and an amateur, and Sabah wins the battles.\n\nSabah closes the doors again at 0.3 Atmospheres, unseals the bridge, a gasping, panicking Jennifer (Decompression's a terrible way to go) shuffling through to the next room, fight the Fork again for the systems, seals the door again, gets the life support working, pressure rising, every pascal easing the pressure on the suit, rising, rising, rising, safe.\n\nNo more taunts over the PA, just sobs. Jennifer loots the Captain's quarters for a new suit, admits Sabah's new rail SMG sailed out into the void, gets chewed out for it. On the bridge, Sabah takes full control of the Shuttle. Couldn't just delete the Fork now, it'd be simple. Not the right thing to do.\n\nThe Fork just begs to die now, and Sabah and Jennifer Argue. Eventually, they agree, and the Fork's forcibly transferred to Sabah's Ghostrider Module. It's offered access to sensory data, but chooses Cold Storage instead, the closest thing to death it's allowed.\n\nReactivate the Comms, talk to the Traffic Control Gang, beg a tug. Jennifer's a celebrity, of sorts, talk of the town, spreading from Ship to Swarm and Swarm to Vo Nguyen and beyond.\n\nJennifer starts calling in favours, wants a body and a new life for the Fork. Sabah argues for the therapy first, or all they'll get is a pretty, registered Corpse. But it's Jennifer's Fork, and her choice. Might see it again. Likely not.\n\nJennifer goes out drinking with a pilot friend. Sabah gets to her hovel, just as the second Railgun SMG finished. Sabah adds another job to the batch with an annoyed mental jab.\n\nShe settles down. A few missions back, they were on a Station in Low Earth Orbit, the Song Cai Flower. Lots of AIs only live milliseconds, emergent in the moment of destruction. No different for the station's controller, she thinks, expect a decade later, now it's been recovered, and the servers sit in her hovel. Hardware repairs complete, corrupted Code re-written, a familiar enough Simulspace environment that the AI shouldn't panic.\n\nAlmost, almost. She sleep on it. AGIs only need a few hours anyway, and the self-repairs need a little time to kick in.\n\nAnother day.",

        "text": "Okay, this one is relatively quick. We're playing Pathfinder whatever the hell edition and the DM decided that we were going to be running around a knockoff of Magic: The Gathering's gothic horror set, Innistrad.  \nCue our party: a halfling sorceress, a human barbarian the size of a bear, a half-Orc inquisitor, and a goblin alchemist.  \nMy alchemist has made it his job to turn boss fights that were intended to be grueling into shorter, more comical encounters.  \nBoss fight #1: Ghoulcaller Gisa (man, fuck necromancers) had this church filled with zombies behind her. I hurled a bomb into the church, some combination of good luck on my part and bad rolls on the DM's led to the entire church exploding, incinerating half of the encounter on my first turn. Spent the rest of the fight lighting the rest of the village on fire and taunting Gisa from rooftops, which helped us save the sorceress, barbarian, and critical plot NPC who all got buried in burning rubble.  \nBoss fight #2: Random giant vampire. This guy popped up threatening another plot NPC (who I hate utterly from a different campaign last year) with an army of smaller vampire lackeys. I tell the barbarian to throw me at the big one, I cling on, light myself on fire (hooray for free fire resistance as a goblin alchemist!), and wait for my next turn to roll around. All of the vampires try to rip me off of the boss's back, I ace the reflex roll to avoid them all, they instead tackle the big guy out of the air. I grease bomb the pile, killing all of the small fry in one shot and coating the surrounding area in grease, so now he needs to roll STR to get the corpses off and acrobatics to actually stand up. He fails. I bowl a grenade into his mouth on the next turn.  \nBoss Fight #3: Shadow clones. The DM decided to make us fight ourselves, the first one we encounter is the barbarian. All 144 hit points and oh god the melee of him. Then the sorceress managed to make a Phantasmal Killer stick and dropped him like it was nothing. The NPC who set up the maze we were trapped in then decided to sic all of the other clones on us at once. I proceeded to befriend mine, the inquisitor failed to befriend his, and the sorceress managed to befriend hers, which then turned and Phantasmal Killer-ed the dark inquisitor. Thus ending the battle far sooner than it ought to have.  \nNeedless to say, the DM is rather vexed with me in particular and the party in general, but we're a significantly more fun and cohesive group than her other one.",

But Cal has come to his aid, confronting the bugbear sorcerer and reveaing that he has the darkstone, catching his attention…\n\nThe Cast of Characters includes:  \nLindsey as *Perdenzia, the Fae Foundling*  \nDJ as *Arrow, the Would-be Knight*  \nCaitlin as *Freya Pendragon Kirkwall, the Forgotten Noble Child*  \nRiley as *Caligeth ‘Cal’ Darwinus, the Apprentice Court Sorcerer*  \n\nCal holds up the obsidian sphere as the lightning flashes dramatically above. The bugbear points a finger and demands the boy hand over the artifact. While still perched in his hands, the strange thing starts to heat up, and he quickly sets it down before taking any damage. As Arrow rolls over, trying to pry himself away from the edge of unconsciousness, Cal prays to the forest spirit of Marc ANTony, asking for any sort of assistance in this fight. Thunder flashes overhead as he feels his prayers answered, the energy of the stormy sky flowing through his veins…\n\nDeeper in the woods, Perry and Freya have just finished up sabotaging the catapults, making sure that they will never harm the village again. But the bear that appeared is under traumatic attacks from the remaining goblins, who seemed determined to take it down with them. Cut and slashed by dozens of wounds, the bear is on its last legs. Rather than let it die of slow bloodless, Freya quickly apologizes to her fae friend and mercy kills the bear, ensuring a quick death. Perry is taken aback by this action, and flees the scene. Freya chases after her, grabbing and restraining her so she can knock some sense into her.\n\nIn the village, the bugbear cackles as eldritch energy glows around him, and the bodies of three goblin warriors stiffly and awkwardly pull themselves from the ground, rotting flesh and festering wounds in all. They lurch towards the two young men, and Arrow finds himself swinging his sword in a desperate attempt to keep them at bay. Channeling the power of the lightning storm, Cal points this energy towards the bugbear, blasting him and forcing the powerful sorcerer to stand back. In range, he waves his hand to summon another undead pawn. Running forward as soon as the spell dissipates, Arrow shouts in anger for his devastated village, and his blade runs the bugbear clean through his left wrist, severing his hand as dark blood spilling the metal. Rather surprised, the bugbear (and the separated hand) falls to the ground, fingers trying to grasp one final spell. Unfortunately, the four goblin zombies (Called GobZobs for convenience) are still at large. Cal focuses the lightning again, hoping that he can hit multiple targets. Unfortunately the power bestowed by marc ANTony seems to be fading, and the bolts of electrical energy shoot outwards across the village, striking any exposed metal and giving any nearby a slight shock.\n\nPerry, having worked through her problems, and Freya appear at the edge of the forest, rushing towards the beleaguered young men. She notches an arrow and strikes a gobzob in the head, striking right through the brain and settling it back to undeath. A royal carriage pulls up, cast in a wave of shielding magical energy similar to Cal’s magical shield spell. The guards in tow, Sir Barry and Sir Wynne, question Cal and Arrow on the whereabouts of Freya. It seems the royal family is being evacuated. Arrow questions that decision in a rather flippant manner, and Sir Barry knocks him aside to speak to Cal. The court sorcerer points out the approaching girls, who join up with the group. The royal family is being brought back to Kirkwall, the Capital City, and the princess is ushered inside. Perry hops on top of the carriage to provide overwatch with her bow, and Cal is given a horse. He asks Sir Barry if Sun can come with him, and he reluctantly agreed. Arrow, still being flippant, asked if Charlotte could come along. In the end, he was forced to pay Sir Barry six silver in ‘taxes’ to allow his fiancee to come along, and the group rode off from the burning village.\n\nAfter a day’s travel they stopped to check their bearings and let the horses rest and drink. Feed is set out as the two knights patrol the surrounding area. It’s not long before trouble brews however, as a bear rushes forward from the brush, clearly enraged and possibly enticed by some magical effect to attack such a large group. Arrow, Cal, and Perry are all attacked under the brutal primal rage of the ursine beast, suffering critical damage. The bear rams into the royal carriage, flipping it over and scattering the royal family inside. Freya pulls herself out to join the fight as Sir Barry and Sir Wynne rush forward, spears pitched and into the beast’s side. Freya cleaves it across the chest with her axe as the knights keep it pinned, and Arrow quickly buries his blade into its heart to silence it. The party, most of which horribly wounded in the fight, stop to catch their breath. This was normal bear attack...and now they all fear that there are many eyes in the dark woods, watching them...",

        "text": "Hello, heroes, explorers, and adventurers of all kinds. Today I have a tale of overconfidence and underpreparedness that you might laugh, and perhaps learn.\n\nEdit: I just now realized that I forgot to say that this is a story from Monster Hunter 4: Ultimate. Sorry about that.\n\nAs a Monster Hunter, it is my duty to protect the people from all sorts of creatures, some as great as the colossal Dah’ren Mohran, to as (relatively) small as the Great Jaggi. As such, it is important to investigate and, if necessary, eliminate monsters exhibiting strange behavior, especially in the wake of the Frenzy Virus that spread across the land not so long ago. One of my superiors in the Guild, a woman I and many others know simply as the Ace Gunner, spotted one such monster: An Azure Rathalos. For those unfamiliar with them, Rathalos are a near-ubiquitous monster capable of feats of flight and ferocity that have rightly earned it the moniker of “King of the Skies”. The Azure Rathalos is a rarer, more dangerous subspecies whose greater strength allows them to fly faster and breath fire more rapidly than the standard Rathalos.\n\nAfter receiving the Ace Gunner’s report I equipped myself with armaments born of a mighty creature and favored quarry of mine known as the Zinogre, as the lightning imbued weapons crafted from its body are especially effective against Rathalos of all kinds. As for the weapon itself it was a fantastic invention known as the Switch Axe, a weapon capable of switching between a fast and far-reaching axe and a powerful sword that channeled energy into the blade, giving it the power to pierce any monster’s hide and allowed for great explosive bursts, though it had to be reloaded now and then when in sword form. However, as I was preparing myself for the journey ahead, I made several critical errors. Firstly, in recent hunts I had been wielding a weapon made of parts of a fellow flying wyvern known as the Seregios that possessed the ability to sharpen itself as I dodged the attacks of monsters and thus forgot to bring whetstones to sharpen my weapon manually for when it grew dull. Secondly, I had failed to check in with the Guild representative who traveled in the same caravan with my as to where the location of the hunt was, thus leaving me incapable of properly preparing for it. Finally, I forgot to bring the paintballs that would allow me to track my quarry wherever they went. The consequences of all of these would rear their ugly heads shortly as I finished my pre-hunt meal and strode off to begin my hunt.\n\nWhen I arrived at the hunting grounds, a series of vast caverns known as the Volcanic Hollow, I realized both of my errors. The high heat in the lower caverns would sap my strength and would cause me to pass out eventually without the aid of Cool Drinks, a wonderful concoction that fights off the negative effects of even the worst ambient heat, though unfortunately not the fiery breath of wyverns. Thankfully, the base camp I would be conducting my hunt from was supplied with a few Cool Drinks, though no whetstones or paintballs due to difficulties getting supplies out to areas inhabited by powerful monsters. I briefly considered turning back and resuming later after I had properly prepared, but a combination of my common recklessness and a desire to ensure this beast didn’t pose a threat anymore spurred me on. I steeled myself for what would certainly be a struggle ahead and, accompanied by my experienced hunting companions, a pair of Felynes named Zulf and Ibuki, I scaled the cliff downward into the hollow. Once I had descended, it was clear what the source of the creature’s strange behavior was: the Rathalos was staring down a Seregios, locked in a territorial struggle that I had, literally, landed right in the middle of. After this little fight, the beasts both took to the skies as the Seregios fled from the Rathalos, leaving me with the daunting task of possibly facing down both at the same time. With my mission in mind, I began my search.\n\nThe first of the two that I found was the Seregios, precariously perched on the web woven by a spider-like monster known as the Nerscylla. How the web supported its weight without being shredded by its sharp talons is a mystery for the ages. Seeing an opportunity to drive the beast away and make it easier to hunt the Rathalos, I brought out my Axe and engaged the creature in combat. The fight was brief, it having no intention of letting another creature try to slay it in the territory it so rightfully usurped and I wanting to simply get back to my mission, we soon parted ways. As I stepped out of its cavern, I found myself nearly face to face with my real quarry. The Azure Rathalos proved to be every bit as fearsome as its reputation suggested, bombarding me with fireballs and flying at incredible speed back and forth across the arena. Through use of the small cliff in the center of the area, I managed to jump on its back and begin driving my hunting knife into it while the beast was nearly helpless to stop me, driving it back to the ground in the process. After exchanging a long and painful series of blows, the creature decided to make its exit to avoid me, and, though I did my best to follow, it eventually left my view and consigned me to wandering through the caverns in search of it. By this point, my blade had already taken a sever beating, growing duller with each strike, requiring me to use the power of the phials used in my weapon's Sword Mode to even cut through its thick hide properly.\n\nHiking through the intensely hot caverns, though much more bearable due to the Cool Drink I had taken earlier, still proved to be arduous, and I was quite glad when I discovered the creature again in the cooler regions of the Hollow nearer the entrance. Once again, the two of us squared off, though this time the Rath saw fit to begin using its venomous claws, which required that I step away and use my antidotes from time to time. Then, just as it seemed like the hunt was progressing as I had hoped for, it was time for the reappearance of my and the Rathalos’ uninvited guest. To top off this already marvelous situation, I the chips and dents in my Sword’s blade had grown larger, making it difficult to even properly strike true against their mighty scales. Thankfully, it wasn’t long before I heard the call of a horn; a signal that the Guild had been able to provide me with additional supplies. And, even better, the Seregios decided that facing both of us at the same time was not something it wanted to get involved in and it left. Seeing an opportunity to resupply with only one deadly wyvern at my back, I quickly scaled the cliff again to raid the supply box of its whetstones, Cool Drinks, and medicines, returning to the fight after I had sharpened my weapon.\n\nWith restored confidence and sharpness, I entered the arena again. Though it somehow seemed that the Rathalos knew of the greater threat I now posed and it fled to a nearby area, but not before I could finally mark it with the pungent paint that would allow me to follow it wherever it flew. Its flight took it to a ridge overlooking the deepest parts of the hollow, though the skirmish their lasted only a brief time before the creature began to show its pain, limping away to return to the nest and rest. Being able to easily track the monster, I followed it, allowing it time to fall asleep and let its guard down. By this time most of medical supplies had been spent and my stamina was wavering, I knew I would have to finish the creature here or possibly face serious injury or worse in its talons. I awakened the Rathalos with a mighty swing of my Axe, putting my entire body weight into the strike and driving it into its face as it slept and dealing massive damage. Even with that, the creature still lived and resumed the battle with gusto.\n\nMy own strength fading, I began to take hit after hit and I began once again to feel the incredible heat, a sign that my Cool Drink had worn off. Then, seeing the danger I was in, my companions performed a technique they called the Flying F-Bomb, using a small wooden rocked to fly into the beast’s face  and cling on, pummeling and blinding it just long enough to take another Cool Drink and ensure that my weapon wouldn’t fail now. The fight then began to resemble some sort of acrobatics display, as I scrambled up huge boulders to avoid the creatures attacks and try to leap onto the beast’s back again so I could bring my knock it out of the sky again. As we clashed, the creature flew back and forth across the cave in the blink of an eye, it almost seemed to teleport as it moved in to strike me or my comrades. Even with its blinding speed, I was finally able to mount it and then ground it. As it lay on the ground, struggling to find its feet again, I morphed my Axe into its Sword mode and drove it into the creature’s neck, preparing to unleash the built up energy in a calamitous burst and end the Rathalos with a bang. And with that final strike, it was no more. I carved a few scales and pieces of wing off of the creature afterwards, allowing the professionals at the Guild to carve up what was left of the corpse after it had been dragged out of the Hollow. However, the appearance of another Seregios, a creature not found in these parts, so soon after the last one I had hunted begged the question: Why are such territorial creatures moving into areas beyond their normal range? It seemed that the Ace Gunner’s immediate superior, the Ace Commander, and his old mentor were wondering the same thing and requested that I meet with them to discuss this after receiving my report. Regardless of what questions were on my mind, it seems that fortune had smiled upon me, as I was rewarded with a Rathalos Ruby, the rarest and most precious material that I could have hoped to have found on this hunt.\n\nTL;DR, I went into a hunt woefully unprepared and ended up getting a pretty excellent reward for my troubles.\n",

It’s difficult to get to from the pedestrian path – you can reach it more easily if you go through the front of the building and take the east door to the alleyway (it’s to the left).\n\n###\n\nMarch 13\n\nPast hundred years or so there’ve been four of them on record. Last one stuck around for a good half a decade. Knocked out a few villages. They slew it by evacuating the area and starving it out. Came back six months later and found it emaciated and dead and surrounded by jackal bones. It ate its servants to survive. Beast half won out in the end.\n\nNever much cared for that particular brand of idolatry.

Wasn’t one of those snotty wizards the academies push out each school year, no, this guy was a darling. Every time he performed one of his magic tricks he’d break it down step-by-step, can’t remember half the stuff he did but I appreciated his candor at the time. Got me attuned to figure out when some halfwit is sprouting illusions like dandelion seeds and from what I’ve heard these lamias can’t control themselves. They get off on it. Covering things up with illusions even when it’s unnecessary.\n\nAt least according to Bekel. Stumbled ninety-five miles across the desert before he came across any sort of city. Ain’t nobody hearing a word out of his mouth, thought he had heatstroke, couldn’t bring his case to the authorities because of a delicate matter which he implored me to keep discrete, which I will. Somehow he got my mailing address from a traveller, asked me to trek over to Hallur to sort things out for him. Should’ve known he wouldn’t be able to pay, but on the plus side, a lamia is not exactly hurting for gold. I’ll come out of this richer than I went in.\n\nNow I’ve got the somewhat difficult task of killing a lamia. I’ve never done something on this scale before, certainly never a monster with servants, so I can’t pull punches like I did with the owlbear. If I’m going to take it down, I need to know everything there is about it.\n\nWhat does it want? That’s the most important thing. I give it what it wants, then I yank it away.\n\nBekel says Camrella (that’s her name) is vain and greedy. Told him no shit. He goes on to say she’s looking for a champion pure of heart … and I’m like, it ain’t gonna be me, that’s for sure. I can get any poor sap to fall head over heels but I doubt anyone would be fooled for a moment into thinking I was a porcelain doll. If the lamia wants a pure-of-heart champion she’ll have to find one somewhere else.\n\nActually, I might know a guy. I’ll update later.\n\nCan I attack it head on? Part of the expertise you learn in this trade is that sometimes rushing headfirst into danger is the most effective tactic. Killed an Incubus not long ago, January I think, and it probably would’ve taken James if I hadn’t had nailed it in the face first chance I got. But at the same time, it’s also a testament to the value of careful planning and research. Cause I didn’t blast an incubus in the face, I blasted an old man who I thought was an incubus. I turned out to be right, but I could’ve just as easily blasted Renaldo behind him and ended up losing James, who is a valuable acquaintance if a bit abrasive at times, and also a brief but memorable affair with the aforementioned Renaldo. It was brief because I kept saying his physique reminded me so much of an incubus. Wasn’t a smart fellow. Took it as an insult. I digress. The point is, I need to learn about this lamia to decide which approach is best.\n\nA head-on approach is not best. Its palace is stuck in the middle of the desert and masked with a few dozen layers of mix-and-matched illusion spells. Not to mention a few dozen jackalwere guards at any point in time. Unless I could put together an army, which frankly would cost more than whatever treasure I’d scoop up from the ruins, I’d have to kill this thing and escape without the guards ever realizing what I’d done.\n\nCourse, I don’t need an army, do I? According to Bekel, there are hundreds of slaves on the property. Brimming with rage and injustice. Put a weapon in their hand and they’ll kill as many jackalweres as I tell them to.\n\nMarch 14\n\nBekel stopped me as I was counting out my assets. Told me that unless I was prepared to pay for the silvering of a hundred weapons, my plan was probably not going to work. The jackalweres are only hurt by silver.\n\nSo that’s not going to work at all.\n\nIt does raise an interesting point: the lamia isn’t exactly a tough fight. I’ve dominated bigger things than a lamia. The challenge here is its servants, who, as Bekel stressed, are nasty cheating twats. Half the time they won’t bother to fight you. They’ll just put you to sleep.\n\nMy efforts to press him about the specifics of their abilities were only met with shrugs and mumbled “I don’t know”s. Seems to me that we’re gonna have to learn more about these creatures.\n\nI want one. How do we catch one?\n\nHere’s what we know about jackalweres: they flip between jackal form, human form, and the big ugly hybrid form with all the claws and fangs and such. They’re cowards alone and killers in a group. They tend to look like frail old men and women and when you show them even a hint of kindness they’ll explode out into their monster form and rip your throat out. Either that, or they’ll put you to sleep with their “put you to sleep” spell and drag you off to the lamia’s palace. That’s how Camrella’s been getting most of her subjects. That’s how she got Bekel.\n\nEasiest way to grab these guys is to set up a counter-ambush. They ambush caravans coming through the desert, and I’m going to get the drop on them. That means somehow becoming immune to the sleep effects or finding someone who is, and who also may actually be able to take down a few of them for me.\n\nI mentioned a friend of mine. He’ll be invaluable, actually. I’ve already sent a missive, although I’m not sure he’s figured out how mail works in this part of the continent yet. I’ll give him some time.\n\nMarch 23\n\nDone some scouting of my own. I’ve always said the most valuable resource for my trade is sitting my ass down at a library. Went shopping for salt—if I wasn’t such a great haggler it’d be prohibitively expensive—and took some soot from a bonfire on the shores of the Baham river. There was a party. I wasn’t invited. Disappointing. In any case, I prepared Comprehend Languages in anticipation of my day hitting the books. Tongues has gotten me through my stay in Hallur so far but it won’t help me here.\n\nRather than exhaustively going through a list of books and references, I’ll summarize what I’ve learned:\n\n- Lamias take refuge in ruined cities. Closest ruined city to Hallur: Carpel. But Bekel didn’t live anywhere near Carpel. There are a few others. I’ve copied a map to my notes and I’ll talk to Bekel about it later.\n- They rely on enchantments. Just touching its skin makes you weak to its effects. I reckon I’d be a pretty good lamia, you know, on a purely objective basis.\n- It’s more powerful than I am in every single way except for one: I can study it, and it can’t study me.\n- Shit. Nevermind. It can totally study me.\n- They’re known for scrying their enemies. Which means I can’t ever make my intentions known. The lamia likely has servants running around the city as I write this. Kindling for the paranoia fire. Gotta conduct my research without drawing attention to myself.\n- They value beauty and power. Normally, this would be great for me, but this specific lamia is interested in the “pure of heart”. I knew this already.\n- They hate fighting. They’ll get in and out as quick as possible. They can disguise themselves and cast illusions whenever they please. Which means I’ll need a way of keeping tracking it even when it’s trying to escape. I have two things that can help: I can trap it in a circle, or I can perhaps locate a specific object that it always carries on its body. I’ll have to ask Bekel if it has any item it keeps close by at all times. Either that, or I employ the services of a ranger.\n- Geas. That’s going to be important. That word keeps coming up. I’ll track down the academy and see if they can help me out with that.\n- She is a servant of Graz’zt. No idea who that is. Must not be very powerful.\n- Jackalweres! Their weakness to silver doesn’t extend to magic. What I mean is, using normal weapons against them might be difficult, but a well-placed fire bolt to the skull’s gonna take them out.\n- They’re compulsive liars. Telling the truth causes them physical pain. If I could get them in a Zone of Truth …\n- They always fight together, so isolating one and pressing it for information is gonna be tough.\n\nTonight: talk to Bekel about any items Camrella keeps close by. Tomorrow: conduct a day trip to the academy to research a spell called geas.\n\nMarch 24\n\nCamrella wields an ornate dagger stolen from the tomb of a forgotten king. It is laced with gold and silver. Rumoured to be as sharp as a halfling’s wit even after lying undisturbed for thousands of years. She would never part with it.\n\nConveniently.\n\nI spoke with the mage who operates the academy today. He tells me geas is a “forbidden spell” in his school because it takes away the basic right of free will of those it is cast upon. I asked if Fireball was forbidden as well because you don’t got any free will if you’re dead, now do you? He was not amused.\n\nIn any case, I got the information I wanted. Geas is about the closest thing you’ll ever get to a poem in Abyssal. Speak it out loud in front of someone and for an entire month they have to follow your command. It isn’t impossible to resist, but … it might pop your brain right open. Like splitting a watermelon.\n\nIt has a couple weaknesses I think I can get around.\n\n1. It must be spoken out loud, first the poem in Abyssal, then the command in whatever language the caster speaks. Which means if I can get a box of Silence up in there it’ll interrupt things.\n2. Takes forever to cast. Long poem. I interrupt it with a counterspell, it’s gone.\n3. You know you’re under its effects as it happens, which means you have some agency in the matter. You’re charmed, but that doesn’t mean you’re unawares.\n4. One can’t seduce you into killing yourself, so the spell evaporates if an action would logically result in your death. Since you have some agency, you can perhaps make some liberal interpretations to your instructions and break free.\n5. It hurts like a bitch to go against your instructions, but once you’ve broken it once, until next morning you can break as many more instructions as you’d like. The trick is to kill her before morning. Which may be difficult. Considering she’s charmed you. I’ll have to find a way to work around that, too.\n6. It can be destroyed by removing the curse. Technically, casting Remove Curse on yourself may not necessarily be contrary to your instructions, so …\n\nI perused their libraries and spent some time copying down Remove Curse. Took it out into the gardens to experiment.\n\nHallur Academy Gardens are magnificent, by the way. Next time you’re here I strongly recommend a visitation. They managed to grow sunflowers, big behemoths of a plant, petals as long as my arm, stalks as tall as an elf, and the grapevines drooping from the balcony ... I suppose the tuition rates must be exorbitant for the school afford something like this.\n\nMarch 30\n\nEridan showed up today. Frightened the hell out of Bekel.\n\nStupid mask still glued to his face. One day I’ll find out what he looks like. Today is not that day.\n\nLove him to bits though.\n\nFilled him in on the situation with the lamia and the jackalweres. He says it shouldn’t be a problem. They won’t be able to put him to sleep. Geas will have trouble working against him. And, most importantly, he is pure of heart, having never taken a life that wasn’t deserving, or a woman he hadn’t wedded.\n\nI asked him how Yolanda was going. He said she was sick. When half-orcs get sick, they get mean. He was obviously relieved to have gotten my message even if he didn’t outright say it. Perhaps some time to herself would do Yolanda good.\n\nWith the Reaper at my side I feel considerably more confident of success.\n\nMarch 31\n\nWhen I got back from the markets, having obtained powdered silver and iron from a special interest supplier, Eridan and I discussed our plan to catch a jackalwere. I’ll set up a magic circle and activate it when we’re ready. We’ll only have an hour to interrogate it, or else this could get expensive. Bekel himself won’t be able to provide much of a reward, so I’m relying on plundering the wealth of the lamia. It had better be good. I’m hemorrhaging gold.\n\nThe trick is, of course, getting the jackalwere into the magic circle in the first place. I talked with Bekel about the possible locations of the lamia’s lair, but all he could offer was the trade route he was on when he was captured.\n\nSee, we want the jackalweres to ambush us. They won’t provide any trouble for Eridan.\n\nIf we can engage them, we’ll be able to capture one. I’ll catch it in a net.\n\nWhich means we’ll need to make ourselves a target for the lamia. Eridan has agreed to bait himself. We’ll spread rumours about a paladin pure of heart, devoted to his duty above all else, utterly incorruptible. A fact which I know to be blatantly false, considering that his hands are still burned from carrying around that glaive for so long, but we can just pretend that’s from some religious thing. Divine searing light. Sure.\n\nThis pure-of-heart hero has arrived to tear down the evils of Graz’zt (still don’t know who that is). He will scour the trade routes for servants of this dark lord. Out of the goodness of his own heart. And definitely not because he’s got this thing in his brain that starts to hurt if he goes too long without killing somebody.\n\nApril 7\n\nWe’re being tailed. I think it’s working.\n\nNext step is to get ourselves a caravan. Head along the Baham River. Slowly. Right next to where Bekel was taken.\n\nApril 9\n\nWe got one.\n\nThey thought we were a bigger group than we were. Two of us plus some convoy drivers we hired for the day. Told them to hide in the secret compartment under the caravan while we fought.\n\nThere were seven of these jackalweres, coming up to in the guise of a poor family. Funny that a family of that size could have survived on the path without a means of transportation or rations, but I digress. Saw through their disguise almost immediately, myself, but Eridan was a little more trusting. He offered to put them under a Zone of Truth to check out their story. Soon as the spell was out of his mouth they all burst into wiry jackal-human hybrids. Patchy hair. Cracked claws.\n\nTried to put Eridan to sleep. Didn’t work.\n\nTried to get me, too. I went down but I didn’t actually fall asleep. I feigned it. Soon as I was down they focused their efforts on Eridan. Which was exactly what he wanted.\n\nEridan killed most of them. Once the tide was turned I leapt back into the fight. Knocked a few down and retreated to the caravan. Blasted any that came after me.\n\nOnce it was clear Eridan wasn’t going down anytime soon they turned tail. I caught one in a net and charmed it so it wouldn’t break free. Eridan chased after the others. Came back soaked in blood. Pretty impressive feat considering he was in full armor, and they’re speedy little buggers. Never asked him how he managed it.\n\nBrought the captured jackal back to Hallur. Drained myself of magic keeping it charmed on the way back. Eventually it started to resist, and Eridan had to hold it in place for an hour. Stupid thing kept shifting rapidly from jackal to hybrid to human to hybrid to jackal. I had to get creative with Suggestion to get it to calm down.\n\nKept trying to put me to sleep. Didn’t seem to realize that its gaze had no effect on me after the initial attack. Interesting to note.\n\nBrought it back to Bekel’s house.\n\nHe couldn’t bear to look at the thing. He was shaking in its presence.\n\nAll we have to do now is get it under a Magic Circle and a Zone of Truth it’ll reveal its secrets to us. With a tiny bit of persuasion. I’m not sure I have enough magic left in me today to charm its tongue into flapping, but we’ll see.\n\nI will update later on today with what we’ve learned.",

        "text": "About midway through the 10th day, a mere four days from their destination, one of the passengers speaks up.\n\nGeneric NPC: Is it just me, or are we going faster? Like, a lot faster?\n\nIndeed, the ride had gotten bumpier lately, and the cart seemed to be getting faster and faster. Krug goes to have a look. He recognizes ‘too fast’ from his days watching his older Kin force the Goblins to play ‘Rocket Race.’ They’d tie the goblins up, put them in a wagon, strap some pilfered Dwarven ‘Rokets’ to them, and light the fuse. It wasn’t a game really, and more like a fireworks display, but Krug had realized that after a point, ‘fast’ becomes ‘dead fast’.\n\nSanders: Uh, I can’t open the door to the Driver’s Compartment. \n\nKrug goes back over and stares blankly at Sanders.\n\nSanders: &lt;sighs&gt; Door. Open. Now.\n\nKrug understands this, and pulls on the door. He is unable to do so.\n\nKrug: Gurk, help. Get angry.\n\nGurk: But hungry. And tired.\n\nKrug: Gurk. Help. Now.\n\nGurk grunts, but goes to help his brother. With much Orc yelling, and many bulged muscles, the door is ripped open and thrown aside, revealing that it had been nailed shut most purposefully. Sanders sticks his head inside.\n\nSanders: Guys. The driver has disappeared, and I can’t fit through this hole. You, Halfling! Go control the horses.\n\nSanders points at a nearby adventurer.\n\nHalfling: But I don’t know the….&lt;grumbleing&gt;. Fine. I’ll save the day!\n\nThe Halfling crawls through the opening.\n\nHalfling: Huh. That’s odd. Where he possibly have- &lt;muffled screams&gt;\n\nThe Halfling vanishes from view, and a few moments later, a dull thump is heard, followed by a familiar voice yelling, the sound quickly getting further away.\n\nKrug: Me go. Me find Halfling.\n\nWith another tremendous display of strength, Krug and Gurk widen the hole enough for the Orcs to get through, causing the wood to groan and crack, a wide one opening right down the middle of the floor. But it holds. Krug goes through first, and immediately feels arms wrap around his neck, and attempt to pull him upwards. Keyword: attempts. A burly bald man, seemingly made from nothing but muscle, grunts in surprise, obviously not expecting an Orc to come through the opening, as Krug stays firmly rooted in spot. Gurk soon follows, and having seen what happened to his brother, he follows with weapon ready and swinging. The Bald Man is unprepared for this surprise attack, and takes a gash across one of his arms, cursing as he leaps back. He promptly leaps upwards, and crawls onto the central supporting beam on top of the caravan, the one that runs parallel to the floor that all the metal rods that support the tarp pass through. He takes up some sort of fighting stance, perfectly balanced on the beam as it sways back and forth. The cart has still not slowed down.\n\nThe two Orcs call for their cats, and their brother. Mittens and Frank proceed to their master’s side promptly. Kurg is not as swift. Sanders gives Kurg a yell as well, but again, to no avail. At this point, one of the Fighters makes the (not so smart) decision to smack Kurg upside the head. Kurg’s eyes snap open, as does his mouth, and he bites down on the hand that hurt him. It explodes in blood and sinew, a few fingers missing.\n\nFighter: OWWW! MY HAND! YOU BASTARD!\n\nSanders: WHAT THE HELL KURG? HE WAS JUST TRYNIG TO WAKE YOU UP!\n\nKurg: He hurt Kurg, Kurg hurt him.\n\nFighter: It was just a smack! You don’t even have a bruise!\n\nKurg: It hurt.\n\nSanders sighs once more, and uses a proper heal on the fighter, restoring his hand back to five digits at the very least. The Fighter grumbles his thanks, and goes to get bandages from his Guild’s medic. Kurg also grumbles and rises from his makeshift bed, plodding after his brothers.\n\nAll 3 Orcs attempt to climb onto the beam, attempt to keep their balance (including one Chakram throw that the Bald Man barely catches, surprised at the ranged attack), fail, and fall through the exact same hole in the tarp. Mittens overshoots his leap and falls off the back of the caravan, holding on with his claws and climbing back in. Gork manages to climb up, but is unable to keep his balance, repeatedly standing up and falling on his stomach. Frank does exactly what Mittens did, and the two cats decide to let their master’s handle it.\n\nThat’s when Gurk has an idea. If they can’t cut the Bald Man, why not cut the thing he’s standing on? Or rather, the thing’s it’s attached to. Gurk promptly takes his Axe (the Orcs are very prompt about things involving their axes, as usual) and cuts through one the metal wires that form the frame of the tarp. It immediately springs outward, tearing the tarp as it goes. Kurg catches on, and does the same. Another wire springs outward. Then another, and another. Krug realizes what they are doing, and cuts another. Finally, just before the entire tarp is torn off the top of the caravan, the Bald Man loses his balance (among many swears and curses, as well as cries of “ARE YOU MAD?”), and tumbles off the top of the caravan, same as the cats did. He also catches himself on the lip of the back of the caravan.\n\nKrug goes over, Mittens at his side.\n\nKrug: “Paladin say be nice. Surrender?”\n\nBald Man: You…offer me a chance to surrender?\n\nKrug: Yes.\n\nBald Man: Sure, I’ll take that. A hand then?\n\nKrug: You strong. You pull self up. Me stand here.\n\nKrug stands aside, Axe at the ready. He trusts no one but the Paladin. And his brothers. And Mittens. Well, maybe not Mittens.\n\nAt this point Gurk goes over and decides that Krug is being silly, and extends a hand forward. The Bald Man immediately springs up, and attempts to grab Gurk, intending to pull him over the side. Gurk’s reflexes, as always, are lightning fast as he pulls himself back.\n\nBald Man: Oh bollocks.\n\nThe Bald Man hits the dirt hard, neck sticking out at a weird angle as he rapidly fades into the distance. The Orcs do not notice this however, and prepare to jump over the side after him…\n\nSanders: BOYS NO!\n\nCasting *Chains of Light* on Krug, and grabbing onto Gurk and Kurg’s belt, Sanders holds the Orcs in place, somehow, and even pulls them back, landing in pile of filth and metal. Krug just stands there, paralyzed and confused, but not attempting to resist the familiar glow of the Paladin.\n\nRandom Adventurer: Guys? Who’s driving the cart?\n\n-------------------------------------\nShorter this time round, have not had the time to put together the City section yet. Enjoy!",

        "text": "When we were [last in 1942 France](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3omoub/nwod_spooky_squad_even_more_weirdos/), the ragtag group of supernatural misfits had finally met up. Now, it's time for some side-questing.\n\n **THE CAST**\n\n**Scratch**- British matter mage on a mission to steal a Nazi code book in Saint Quentin, France. The only one on this covert mission that speaks a lick of German. Likes radios, jazz, and spam. Dislikes ghosts, things not making sense, and Nazis.\n\n**Marco**- Former Italian mobster who also happens to be a werewolf. Likes collecting weapons, venison and punching things. Dislikes spiders, canned food and Nazis.\n\n**Maron**- French space mage and expert marksman. Bit of a country boy. Likes sleeping, being far away from the action, and his owl Delphon. Dislikes being told to hurry up and Nazis.\n\nScratch had barely gotten any sleep. He had spent most of the night reading and re-reading the letter that Maron had delivered to him. The first paper was an overhead map of the base he would have to raid, including labels for the comms building, barracks, and one building labeled \"Experimental Building?\". The second paper was new orders from his higher ups. Stealing the code book was still the main objective, but now he had to look into the \"Experimental Building?\" and find what was going down there. Afterwards, he needed to plant the Comp C that Marco had brought and blow it right the fuck up. Suffice to say, Scratch had a lot on his mind as he went to breakfast that morning.\n\nScratch decided to listen to the radio to calm his mind and connected his headphones to his flashlight/radio multi-tool. He flipped through the stations then, sure enough, the noise was back. That low, rumbling, white static-y noise that had been haunting him since he left Britain showed up on a random station. It lasted for a few minutes before disappearing and resurfacing on another station, the broadcasters seemingly not noticing this phenomenon and playing on like nothing happened. While mulling over this and munching on some spam and crackers, Cecil, the man in charge of the resistance movement the Spookies were currently bumming at, asked the three men at the table if they'd be willing to do a quick job for him.\n\nThe Nazis were delivering a shipment of supplies from the base in town along a nearby road in a few hours and Cecil was wondering if the three, whom he had no idea were all supernatural freakazoids, could go and requisition the trucks and their goods. The trio gladly accepted the opportunity to go beat up some Jerry's and headed out to prepare an ambush. When they got to a good patch of road, Scratch ordered Maron further away and Marco into the nearby woods while he worked on the road. After making a few adjustments with his control over base matter, Scratch ran off to join Marco in wait. The convoy came an hour or so later, two trucks protected by a jeep in front and behind making their way to the next checkpoint. Suddenly, the car in front slowed down and began to sink, stopping the entire convoy. Somehow, a good portion of the road had been turned into five feet deep of mud. What are the chances of that? The four riding in the front car and the passenger of the first truck moved to pull the car out of the mud while others moved to defensive positions. Scratch gave the signal and it all went to hell.\n\nThe next twenty seconds or so were especially bad for the Nazis despite outnumbering us 10 to 3 1/2. The truck drivers were both shot with a .45, the five up front were sprayed with Marco's Thompson, several fell to the ground, whistling from their skulls, due to Maron's marksmanship, and two had their faces clawed off by a very perturbed owl. Most of them had no idea what was going on or where the shots were coming from and many went down before they could get a single shot off. But one soldier (who will forever go down in infamy as Nazi soldier #7) was on the top of his game that day. He located the two closest shooters and fired at them from a safe distance, winging Marco and landing a shot that put Scratch on the ground. It wasn't a fatal wound, but Scratch decided to play dead so he could take out the ankles of some other soldiers hiding behind the trucks. As quick as it started, it was over. All the soldiers were dead, now it was time for looting.\n\nScratch tore off the sleeve of a nearby corpse and used it to bandage his side wound as he made his way over to the first truck. Inside were boxes full of rifles, pistols, smg's, and a few potato mashers, but he also noticed a small hidden compartment. Inside was a safe that Scratch opened simply by bopping it slightly and letting his magic do the work. What he found was something straight out of a science fiction novel. It had a body of a gatling gun but a shorter barrel, jet black, and had wires sticking out of it. With it was a crystal that radiated blue light and seemed like it would fit in the slot on the bottom of the machine. On the side was some writing that Scratch deciphered as \"Photon\". The included blueprints only confirmed the weird.\n\nIt was a goddamn photon cannon. The crazy krauts had weaponized light.This was Scratch's life now. The part of him that just wanted to live a normal life screamed a little, but he calmly packed the weapon up moved on.\n\nWith the other's help, Scratch stripped the corpses of their weapons and uniforms and then dumped them in the mud before reverting the road back to normal. Scratch wondered if this made him a stone cold killer but then remembered that they were Nazis so it was alright. Now they only problem was driving the truck full of supplies back, which meant going through at least one enemy checkpoint. Scratch had no choice but to drive the truck while still nursing the hole in his side because he was the only one who could speak German. He and Maron donned the stolen uniforms, looking like proper Fritzs', while Marco hid in the back. Scratch got to the checkpoint and made up bullshit and small talk with the guard until he was let through. Once out of sight, Scratch promptly tore off the road at full speed until they made it back to camp. Scratch took off the uniform and laid down in a bed to get proper attention for his wound.\n\nBut it doesn't end just yet for tonight. You see, the night before, Maron had heard some animal noises in the nearby barn while sighting in his rifle. When he inspected though, the creature eluded his detection. So Maron had set up a magical alarm to alert him when the creature came by again. The next night, after their little raid, the alarm went off if Maron's head and he immediately scryed the barn to find Marco walking in. Marco was known to disappear every night but no one knew why. Plus, he had never told the others what he was to make him applicable for Spooky Squad. Still watching, Maron observed Marco vanish behind some hay, return as a wolf and run off into the night. Well that explained a lot of things. Maron woke Scratch up and asked to meet him in the barn.\n\nMaron explained to Scratch what he had seen. Scratch was interested but not entirely surprised as Marco always had a look of willingness to bite a man's throat out, plus he was huge. Suddenly, the two heard some noise at the entrance of the barn. They turned and found a silver wolf staring at them. Scratch welcomed it and said that it was honestly pretty cool to have a super strong werewolf on his side. This seemed to make the wolf happy, which then jumped behind some hay and Marco emerged a few seconds later. Since all three of them were there, Scratch decided to talk about something. It seemed very likely that they would all be leaving on the same ride out of France and only when his job was done. With this very difficult job at hand and the abilities he had seen them display, Scratch asked for their further assistance on his mission. The other two smiled and agreed, they had all experienced their first combat together earlier and felt that they would make a good team.\n\n The three men shook hands in the barn then returned to their beds. The time was coming soon and they needed to bring their A-game.",

        "text": "Author's note - *This is a followup to a post I made here a very long time ago. Long story short I was struggling with depression and unemployment and could not bring myself to continue the story. As things get better, I find myself missing my stories, so I figured I would continue the story. No she is not named after the show. I actually haven't seen the show yet.* \n\n**[Prologue - Exodus](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2ksll8/mount_and_blade_warband_gekokujo_mod_a_thousand/)**\n\n* Chapter 1 - **Again!**\n\nIt was dim when she stepped outside. Her time on the road had clouded her judgement of time, and Cora stood unsure of if it was sunrise or sunset. \n\nTaichi watched silently from the door for a moment, and then spoke up \"You better hurry! They will be looking for someone armed in the street. The dojo is just up the road towards the castle.\"\n\n\"I'll be back with the men.\" Cora said as she started walking towards the lord's castle.\n\nShe walked on for awhile before realizing she didn't actually know what this dojo looked like. Her expression turned to something of a grimace at the thought of such a minor mistake setting her back from her plans. She thought briefly about asking where it might be, but she thought they might see her weapon and alert the guard. In reality, it was her pride keeping her from asking.\n\nLuckily, she eventually came upon a large squared building with the shouts of kata and telltale sound of wood hammering on wood. *Ah, this must be the place*, Cora thought to herself. She slid open the door and stepped through the passage. This building was a no nonsense design. The walls she had seen outside were the only walls there. Looking around she saw thirty or so men and a handful of women training, with one man standing straight overseeing the fight in the middle of the building. He stood watching two men with wood shaped like katanas swing at each other. She watched briefly.\n\nThe men were sloppy, so focused on hurting their opponent they did not think to defend themselves. The man in black garments wielded his sword like a club, as though he could cleave his opponent in two by dropping his sword on his head. The man in white constantly forgot to turn his hips into his swings, and due to the vertical nature of his opponent's attacks, never guarded his ribs. \n\nAfter each of them landed a strike the \"victor\" would stop and look hopefully at the older man watching them. His response was always the same.\n\n\"Again!\"\n\nHe did not offer advice. \n\n\"Again!\"\n\nHe did not tell them why he was not satisfied. \n\n\"Again!\"\n\nHe only offered a chance to improve.\n\nCora only needed that chance. She stepped beside him. \n\n\"Again!\" But this time the men simply stared at the woman who had the audacity to stand beside their teacher. As these men stopped, slowly the whole dojo noticed that the duelists were not fighting and looked at her as well. She saw looks of disgust, anger, and dark smiles of vulgarity, but the most piercing emotion she saw came from the few women in attendance. Pure hatred. The older man was clearly the master of this dojo, placing herself beside him was an affront in the eyes of his students.\n\n*I ran out of time for the rest of this chapter. Chapter 2 will have combat I promise!*",

        "text": "*This is an actual encounter that I've put into a narrative form. The ending occurs as it happened. Names have been kept the same to embarrass the dead.*\n\n---\n\nThe bag tumbled to the ground with a metallic clang and the dull splinter of broken glass, and an assortment of odds-and-ends spilled out across the flagstone floor, even a shriveled orange rolled away eagerly and hid in the shadow of a moldy wardrobe.\n\n\"Godsdammit! I'm *tired* of this shit!\", Kulock bellowed, red-faced, his teeth showing in a raged grimace, and he stalked over to the ruined bedchamber's door and kicked it open, cracking a few water-softened boards. \"Vrayce! VRACE! Get *IN* here!\"\n\nThe old bard poked his head out of the room across the hall, the permanent scowl on his face deepened even more, and he barked, \"What is it now, 'Lock? I'm dealing with my own problems right now! Can't you wipe your *own* ass!?\"\n\nThe ranger snarled back at him, \"Fuck you Vrayce! Everytime I turn around one of you fuckers has cut my straps, tied my boots together, unbound the heads from my arrows or taken a *shit* in my porridge! I'm *TIRED* of it!\"\n\nThe gnome spluttered, his raggedy grey shanks quivered while he purpled. He pointed an arthritic finger at the grizzled ranger and stabbed it as he yelled, \"You think *WE* did that, you lying sonofabitch?! *YOU* are the one who cut my fuckin strings last night, because you're such a bastard!\", and Vrayce pulled a lute from behind him, the strings cut and splayed in all directions like cat's whiskers, and brandished it at Kulock. \"I know you don't like my singing, but this was *too* much! Asshole!\" The bard retreated back into his room and slammed the door as hard as the old boards would allow. \n\nDown the hall a new voice cried out, \"Oi! What's all the racket about?! You two having another lover's spat?\"\nA lightly armored elf, his breastplate gaudily emblazoned with the twin scales of Priturn, strode down the canted hallway of the old mansion, his longsword beating a soft tattoo as it tapped his hip with his strides. \n\nKulock turned on him and let out another string of invectives, filthy enough to make anyone else but the charming young paladin blush with embarrassment or rage, but Ishkitah just smiled, knowing Kulock was just venting, and he didn't take it personally. He reached the ranger's side and laid a friendly hand on his shoulder and said, \"I didn't think you sewed my socks together, my friend, or pissed in my canteen, but *something* is clearly going on, and none of us are doing it. Honest.\"\n\nKulock just stared at him, still blowing hard, but calming with every breath. It was hard not to listen to the elf's soothing tone and not feel beguiled by his open honesty. He shrugged the hand off his shoulder and said, evenly, \"I want to believe you, Kit, but by the Deceiver, if its not pranks, then what? Godsrotting bad luck? I feel like we've angered this place, or something. Like it doesn't want us here!\"\n\nThe paladin smiled, showing even, white teeth. \"Of course it doesn't want us here. We came to find the secret it's hiding. It won't give it up so easily. You need to relax. We haven't been attacked, just annoyed. Whatever it is, maybe it *can't* hurt us.\" He smiled again. \"You'll see. Its not so hard when you---\"\n\nAn inhuman shrieking came from the bard's room across the hall, and both elf and man moved as one and shouldered the door, nearly tearing it from its rusty hinges. \n\nThe old gnome was standing in the middle of the large, mostly empty bedchamber. His bedroll was still on the floor, and a stack of thin books was piled near the bundle Vrayce used for a pillow. His rucksack lay nearby, upright and neatly packed. His face was a mask of horror.\n\nAll around the terrified bard were tiny, ugly creatures, no bigger than rats, but bipedal. The looked like deformed little men, molded of clay, and dirt, and flesh, folded again and again, until it resembled these small creatures. All were clothed with scraps of rags, some in makeshift trousers, others in capes, some only had filthy strings as headbands, where tiny grotesqueries dangled like macabre trophies. \n\nAll were armed with some crude weapon. Kulock saw rusty sewing needles, a sharpened fork, a broken garden trowel, even a shard from a man-sized blade, crudely lashed to a broken chunk of wood. There were rats among them, thick-bodied and some were circled with crude saddles, offcuts of leather cinched with sinew, or string. \n\nVrayce's eyes were bright circles, his empty hands were open, imploring. His face white as a sheet. \"I- I kicked one of them. I thought it was a *rat*. When I turned around, there they were!\" He shuddered and Ishkitar held his hands out, palms up, speaking slowly. \"Don't move, Vrayce. Don't make *any* sudden movements, ok? I know what these things are, and you can't reason with them and you can't be aggressive, ok? Just walk towards me, slowly, ok? Slowly. It's ok, just walk to-\" \n\nKulock cut in, his face twisted with revulsion, \"Fuck this! Move, Vrayce!\" and he shouldered the paralyzed bard aside, lunging with his longsword towards one of the creatures, but he was too slow, and it vanished into a hole in the floorboards. \n\nSuddenly the air was full of hissing, and all the tiny creatures moved like lightning, and disappeared into cracks and chinks in the walls and rotting baseboards as quickly as they had appeared. \n\nIshkatar moaned, \"*Why*, 'Lock?! I told you not to...\" and he broke off. His head tipped back and he spun in a slow circle, his mouth open, eyes wide. He whispered to the others, \"*Listen*! They are in the walls. All around us.\" He danced back from a worm-eaten patch of floor, and looked at the others. \"They are in the *floors*! We need to *go*. Now!\"\n\nThe room exploded into motion, Vrayce scooping his books into his bedroll and balling the whole thing up while Kulock dashed for his room and Ishkatar ran for the chamber down the hall, hoping the *ratkin* had not fouled any more of his stores, and fell bloodily through some rat-chewed and weakened floorboards, down two stories where he passed out after hearing both of his legs break like thick tree branches, bright and clean sounding, and his lifeblood pooled around him in the dusty darkness of the basement.\n\nVrayce and Kulock weren't found again for 2 years, when their skeletons were taken as an ill omen by the a group of fortune-hunters, eager to reap the rumored prize of Hagarel House, but the rogue of their group, a cocky halfling, took 'Lock's skull and mocked the others with it, keeping it as a running joke until he himself was poisoned by dozens of tiny blowgun darts while he slept.

        "text": "I have been DMing a campaign for a quite some time, we meet once a week to go through this story based campaign I have been working on; one \"chapter\" usually consists of one primary quest with two or three quests in between.\n\nAfter the first few quests, my group had been complaining about a lack of rewards. I try to tell them that, as lvl 2s and 3s who have been only adventuring for a total of a week(ish), the reality of you finding an abhorent amount of gold and magic items on the basic monsters/humans are slim.\n\nStill, more complaints and rule book arguing and some pouty faces.\n\nSo I create a small ghost campaign to give them a few advanced monsters with better rewards. Now my paladin has attached a haunted doorknob to his tower shield that casts the illusion of a door when placed against a wall, my elven ranger has a dagger that captures souls of the creatures it slays, my bow ranger has a haunted book titled \"She never let's go.\" (the holder can't ever let it go from their hand), my druid has a magic mirror that can show the past or the future in it's reflection (a piece to keep them on track if they get confused or don't know what to do), and my bard has a key that constantly shifts its shape (can open any non magic lock once a day and then resets to a rusty key till the next full moon).\n\nSatisfied we continue on several more quests. Obtaining more gold and a few more evil magic trinkets. Along the way, more bickering and arguing about rules they can try to get away with or magic events that don't work in their favor.\n\nWe are reaching the end of the chapter 2 quest where they have to storm the keep of the Lord who had been giving them quests. His private army, the Legionars (pompous idiots who spent all tax money on luxuries, shiny armor, and +1 weapons, but don't know how to properly use them), have lead a coup and taken the town over; forcing the kingdoms army to show up and try to restore peace. The head Kingdom soldier, who was an undercover noble giving a few side quests while obtaining information from the hero's, tasks them with getting inside and either resolving things peacefully or murdelizing everyone except the lord and his idiot brother.\n\nFew campaigns are ever resolved peacefully...\n\nThe layout of the keep was the main hallway that lead to the lords throne, a dancing room to the right, and the dining hall and kitchen to the left. There is this massive door that blocks the way to the throne with an elaborate locking mechanism that requires a key to be assembled from parts that a lieutenant has in each front room. This layout was to give them max XP and loot from multiple soldiers and give them the fun of experiencing some creative traps I came up with. Oil fires, falling chandeliers, trip wires that pull full plate armor on you, rogues hiding in the curtains, hidden passageways to flank enemies, ext.\n\nSo they clear the first room, taking minimal damage. This is the conversation after investigating the door\n\nDM-the door is heavy and locked with an unusual lock\n\nElf Ranger- I roll to pick the lock...23!\n\nDM- As you try to pick, you realize that this lock requires several interior components that prevent lockpicking.\n\nElf Ranger- But...I got over 20!!!\n\nDM- That's not how rolling always works.\n\nElf Ranger- Yes it does!!!\n\nDM- If you rolled a nat 20 strength check to punch a mountain, would you expect the mountain to shatter?? \n\nElf Ranger- no but...\n\nDM- you can roll a nat 20 diplomacy check, but that doesn't mean you can convince the King to just hand over his crown!\n\nElf Ranger- but...\n\nDM- No buts, you can't 20 your ways through every encounter if those rolls would defy the laws of physics, nature, or common sense. If you try to pick a lock without the proper items required to even turn the mechanisms, it won't work.\n\nPaladin- (frustrated that I am not letting things play the way they want) I am breaking the door down.\n\nDM- The door is thick, adorned with an interwoven pattern. You can see through the pattern there are heavy steel bars that extend into the walls. This door was designed as a last line of defense to stop intruders from getting in. (not making this up, I planned for it ahead of time)\n\nPaladin- Fine, I will chop it down!!!\n\nDM-You don't have an axe\n\nPaladin- we have the throwing axes!\n\nDM-...It's still interwoven with steel bars...I doubt your hand axe will make it through those\n\nDruid- (Who had obtained the first part of the key) Guys, I think we need to get the other parts of this key to open the door.\n\nDM- She sounds like she has this figured out.\n\nThe whole time, the bard has been typing up everything that was happening, so she could retell the story the next campaign as a drunken bard would. As more arguing about me being a bad DM cause I am not letting them do things how they want happens; she stops typing, raises her hand to get my attention and asks\n\nBard-\"What about my magic key?\"\n\nDM-.....what?\n\nBard- The magic key you gave me. It can open any basic lock; since this one is not magical, but requires a basic key that has been broken apart, then my magic key should work right???\n\nThe entire group stops bickering and looks at me with quiet, wide eyed defiance. Silently I ponder how I could have forgotten such a plot twist in the story. Hours of work and planning to give them a fun campaign, utterly destroyed over a simple overlook.\n\nNow I am left with a choice. Do I give in and allow the group to skip hours of gameplay to rush to the final boss, skipping over a hundreds of xp and loot opportunities but allowing them to be happy they outsmarted the DM. Or do I crush their hopes and dream, retaining my \"bad DM\" status, but stay content knowing the characters will actually be stronger for the REAL final boss I have planned...\n\nDM-......Keeping in mind that everything that transpired after the Head Legionare closed the door on you took a matter of minutes, thinking he has sealed you off for a while if not permanently; he barely makes it to the throne, giving his remaining soldiers orders, before turning around to see the group he had just sealed off moments ago standing mere feet away covered in the blood of his previous soldiers. He chokes on his spittal, trips on the stairs, and falls on his ass in utter shock.\n\nThe group laugh and cheer and are all excited and happy that they finally got to pull one over on me. Whatever, next time you get a magic rock that always points north.",

But we gained a new character from our friend JP. \nJP built a grungy mountain man skilled in sneaking, bow and arrows, and basic first aid. When the group finds him, Jim was plotting on how to sneak out of the house to find more liquor when he sees a man wearing a beatnik beard and a gilly suit sneaking around among the hoard outside. \nJim invites him in on the idea that, \"there's a man that can find me more booze!\"\nMountain man's name is Yoman, Yoman the bow man, JP is special but that's why we like him.\nNow that the group is together I start bringing out the story.\n\n\"It's the morning of the third day since the K-Mart raid, the hoard has thinned and in the early light, you see a man jogging.\"\nThe group is confused, jogging? Like through the hoard? Yes that dude is just running at an aerobic speed perfect for raising the heart rate just a bit. They see him dodge the few zombies that chase him but after a while the man disappears. The party names him Joggerman. \n\nThey spend the rest of the day fortifying the house and laying low. The next morning they see Joggerman doing his morning jog, baller doesn't give a shit, he's got to get his daily running gains apocalypse or not. As the hoard clears even more the group goes out and raids a convenience store with the sneaky powers of Yoman. Jim gets his liquor and the group gets a few more snacks. \n\nThen about afternoon on the 4th day, a cop car drives slowly by their house. It's a sheriff car. The car stops by a broken car that was pushed out into the street. The party sees the man in the car get out and place a yellow slip of paper on the windshield. He gave the car ticket. Then the sheriff drives away.\n\nThe party then debates what to do next and Yoman tells them about a store on main street that's still open, being run by a small group.\n\nThe group sneaks down to mainstreet pretty easily since shitty nurse isn't there making things shitty. They decide to explore Main Street for a while, when Yoman finds a pet store. As Yoman and Frankie aproach it a few dogs come running out tipping around them. Frankie decided a small dachshund was a threat and kicked it. The rest of the group raged at him for the rest of the adventure.\nFrankie, eager to find a dog that he hadn't kicked, tamed a small black hound. He named it Dogmeat.\n They find the last open store near where they entered Main Street, it was an old Jewish 2 story deli that had the lower half walled off and a ladder leading up to the second story. On the wall beneath is it said OPEN. Jim was very intent on robbing the store and taking all the loot, and managed to convince the rest of the group to help him.\n\nThe group approached the store cautiously, and as they came close a man with a large assault rifle yelled at them \"put your weapons in the basket if you want to do business!\". \nA small wicker basket was lowered down to the ground beside them.\n\nEvery member of the group then made slight of hand checks to hide their weapons on them, they put only a pistol and a knife in the basket. The basket was then pulled up and a ladder was sent down. The group was told to climb up one at a time. When each member got up they were patted down and searched for weapons. There were four guys all with assault rifles controlling the store. After intense negotiations the group came out of the store laden with loot. \n\nIt was late in the evening and the sun was starting to go down,as the group started sneaking home they say a sheriff's car pull up to them. A drunken voice called out:\n\"Hey, iss late, you guys need a ride?\"\nJim ran off in a paranoid panic, but Yoman, Dogmeat, and Frankie Fly hopped in.\n\nAs the squad car zoomed through night at a breakneck pace it became clear that the sheriff was delusional, but friendly, he told the group that his name was Sheriff Henderson. Henderson told them to be safe and bid them goodnight.\nHenderson got them home safe and sound and soon Crazy Jim came running up and joined the group.\n\nThe group had gotten some much needed supplies and met some key characters, not much happened in the way of action but it was setup for the next session when shit started getting crazy.\nAnother important thing was that Frankie's player, Rus had begun suspecting that due to the quiet session and new characters things were going to be going the route silent hill or something. Though it wasn't the intended direction, conspiracy theories make everything much more fun, especially when one member of the party is freaked out.\n\nSorry for the delay, Internet cut out and had to post at school. Will post more when I can.",

The rest of the party redoubled their efforts, slinging fire, arrows, whips, and various other hurty things toward Girl-tan to make her stop hurting people. It was just lucky that Girl-tan herself was an abysmally bad shot.\n\nBut what about the sorcerer? See, he'd blown a LOT of spell slots on the fight, and was now running on empty. So what does he do? Directly cast wild surges, in the hopes that whatever minor side-effect happens will be helpful!\n\n&gt; DM: Rolled 8140. The air is filled with a deafening clatter. Rolled 7020, Girl-tan's clothes are now icy and semi-transluscent. Rolled 8132, a massive earthquake shifts the battlefield one mile north. EVERYONE ROLL REFLEX!\n\nA lot of weird shit happened after that. The wild magic convinced the sorcerer that he should try to kill himself with the next silver object he finds, Girl-tan got involuntarily shapeshifted into a horse, Girl-tan was forced to telekinetically scream her name while attacking, the time-thief scored a crit and put Girl-Tan in temporal stasis, the sorcerer accidentally paralyzed himself, all of Girl-tan's accomplishments were erased from history, the sorcerer started breathing healing magic, and the sorcerer became convinced that Girl-tan was his guardian angel and one and only true love. Right before the Gandalf freed herself and charged, decapitating Girl-tan with a lucky crit.\n\nAfter that, the sorcerer found a silver hand-mirror on Girl-tan's body which he promptly used to try and commit seppuku.\n\n[Random magic is fun as hell.](http://centralia.aquest.com/downloads/NLRMEv2.pdf)",

        "text": "So a few months ago I started running a class style 5e D&amp;D campaign and it was met with failure as half the party wanted to be murder hobos and the other half was neutral chaotic and only wanted the loot. None of the players could be talked out of that faggotry and they railroaded til I had to end the adventure early.\n    After this failure I didn't want to play D&amp;D for while. But when the new season of walking dead came out and Rick looked like a grimey murder hobo, I came up with a campaign idea. I built a system using points like gurps but with 5e mechanics and a few home brew rules. Then I got my friends together and they built their characters.\n  \nFirst character: Frankie Fly, a failed gang leader who led a small group of 12 year olds in various shenanigans until he was overthrown by a 13 year old. He was ambidextrous and only used knives.\n\nSecond character: Shitty nurse that everyone hated from the beginning played by a male and was awkward as fuck. \n\nThen the third character: Jim Bean. An alcoholic nam' vet, think Walter Sobchak, who once got so sloshed he tried to change his name to Jim Beam, the drink, but fucked it up. He had the psychopath trait, a tooth necklace, two bottles of Bacardi, and  a crazy high gun skill and intimidation.\n\nFirst session:\n  The story starts off:\nIt's the zombie apocalypse, but even worse you're in Connecticut.\nA chorus of groans from the party.\n\n  The party started off on the run and quickly found a small brick and mortar house to lay low in. As it was almost night and they just wanted to get safe they holed up in the attic. The next day they went out and found a crawler that had been downstairs, Frankie stabber-hands shanked it real good and silenced it before it could alert other zombies. The group then did the usual looting and fortifying of the house.\n    \n   During the looting phase, Jim finds mysterious pills, thinks they might be some type of laxatives and takes one with a shot of bacardi and sleeps it out while the rest of the group raids. Their sleeping quarters is in the attic, which is their safe zone. After a while Jim is about to cack his pants and can't get to the toilet, so he lets it out into a box of old decorations, which he then throws out the window. When shitty nurse arrives she tells him that those laxatives were made to flush poisons out of a body.\n   \n  After uniting with shitty nurse, the group decides that they don't have enough rations to last the week, they have to leave the safety of the house and go raiding. While the group debates raiding locations Jim remembers that there was a delivery truck down by the K-mart that was never unpacked. \n  \n The group decides that's their best bet and heads down to the mart. Along the way the group makes several stealth checks, Jim and Fly make their checks alright since they had decent stats but since shitty nurse only had two possible uses, flirting and nursing, she failed and everyone called her shitty.\n \n   Now there's a small group of Zeds following the group as they arrive a K-Mart. They skirt around the heavily infested entrance and go round back. They find the truck, and after some searches, bolt cutters. \n\n  Originally the bolt cutters were intended to cut the locks holding the door of the truck down. But, Jim took the cutters and smashed the truck's window in. Instantly the car alarm goes off for about a minute until it goes dead. The truck is broke, and so are Jim's dreams of zooming through the city in a K-Mart delivery truck. \n\nJim opens up the loading door from the inside and everyone grabs boxes of food as the hoard starts to surround them. When the groups asks what food it is I roll on the loot check using the food items I had. 31, fucking scooby snacks, put them on there as a joke, now these poor guys are gonna live on sugar cardboard for the next few weeks.\n    \n   As the group flees clutching crates of Scooby snacks, Jim decides to run for it. Jim has a nam' flashback and howls, \"15 men enter one man leaves!\" He throws a crate of Scooby snacks away and holds his pistol with the empty hand. He books it toward the hoard and shoots his way out, excellent rolls with good stats, Jim was out.\n \n   Frankie Mc2stabber then comes runnin' with three crates of Scooby snacks balanced one on another, Frankie Fly doesn't give a shit about zombies. Frankie Fly barrels down at the hoard running toward them no weapons, just tries to play red rover red rover with the undead. Rolls a 19 and plus his crazy strength mod he just crashes through the hoard using crates of Scooby snacks to push them away.\n\n   Then shitty nurse is up, try's to play red rover, get grabbed, three ghouls on her, drops her snacks, fails every roll since nursin' and flirtin' don't help when you get got. So, Jim though he is crazy he doesn't want to see shitty nurse die at anyone's hands but his own. He shoots the ghouls, or \"gooks\" as he calls them, and frees shitty nurse, who runs back to the house, contributing nothing but being shitty. Group starts to resent shitty nurse heavily at this point.\n \n  Group is stuck inside house and fortifies and waits out the hoard.\n  \n  We've had about 5 sessions now, they get more interesting as time goes on. Will post the rest if there's interest.",

        "text": "I'll kill them - all of them for daring such treason!\n\nI storm over to the helm, feeling my hands twitch in anger, no longer bothering to keep my temper in check.  Rage is good, it'll fire up these scared little children and make them men!  I have no experience commanding on this scale, or anything resembling this situation.  I've watched Klaus and his father before him; if I can just convince the crowds I know what I'm doing, emulate the presence of these Rogue Traders, it should be enough to spur on the crew's spirits.  I grasp the wheel and connect to the vox, broadcasting over our entire vessel.\n\n\"Listen to me, all of you!\" I turn to face the crew on the bridge, throwing my hands back in the expressive way Klaus does so well.  \"I am the Seneschal of this ship - the second in command - and I will not stand for this atrocity!\"  These witches have no idea who they've crossed.  \"People apart of the Winter's family do now cower in fear from the likes of heretics.  We destroy them!  Any who stand against us will fall against our will!\"  Every pair of eyes on the bridge is glued to me.  \"Show these witches what you're made of!\"  \n\nSwitching broadcast to the bridge, I begin to issue commands.  \"If you all listen to me, do as I say, then we will survive.  Pull up the screens from the Cargo Bay and Marcocannon chamber; I need to see our enemy's movements.\"  I point to the team of stationed Tech Priests.  \"Find the Barron.  I don't care if you hack the cameras in the Underdecks, track the signal from his mircobead - just do it!\"  They all spring into action. \n\nFinally, I see first hand the situation unfolding.  In the Cargo Bay Quinlin and his pilgrims are fighting passionately, the wrath of the Emperor burning in their attacks.  Over in the Macrocannon chamber I see many cultists scattered around the freshly fired weapons, scrambling to reload a second shot.  Loyal men appear to be trying to fight them off.  From the back of the room one of the dredge steps forward, looking somewhat familiar, acting on his own.  He bends down, locking his low quality prosthetic firmly into place before raising the heavy stubber in his arms, unloading the contents into the cultists.  The rapid fire from the stubber catches the witches off guard, mowing them down and causing the rest to flee backward.  I watch as the young man single-handedly drives back the tide, the other loyalists getting their act together in the commotion, gaining the upper hand and locking down the room.\n\nThinking back, he was the one Court had been teaching how to shoot, but was injured on a previous excursion.  His name: Zark.  It would appear that losing two of his limbs hasn't dampened his spirits.  I had intended to investigate him, to make sure he was not a spy or worse, but these actions speak for themselves.  He turns to the security camera, as if he knows I'm watching, and flashes a thumbs up with his right hand.  I'll remember this.\n\nFrom outside the Marcocannon chamber, hordes more witches start to gather.  The doors are of course now locked down, but I fear they may not hold given the power some of these individuals hold.  When we first found out about this infestation, only days ago, we saw but a taste of their talents.  The one whom attacked Klaus demonstrated his bloodthirsty prowess, turning his fingers to knives and his skin to steel.  But I blasted him back then with the power of my Inferno pistol, and now the others will in turn burn.  If only someone in that room wore a microbead, then I could commune with them directly.\n\n\"Lord Winguard.\"  My attention is drawn away momentarily.  Over comms I receive a call from none other than the missing Barron.\n\n\"Barron,\" please no more bad news, \"what is happening down there?  Where in Emperor's name are you?\"\n\nHe details the ambush sprung by the witches.  To our disadvantage, it was a dreadful success.  A sizeable chunk of his soldiers met their ends, losing them in the chaos.  He was forced to fall back and regroup, saving unnecessary bloodshed.  I, in kind, catch him up on what he has missed.\n\n\"Unfortunately,\" he goes on, \"we are lost.  I'll need help to navigate our way back out of this blasted place to meet the hordes upstairs.\"\n\n\"One moment.\"  I stride over to the Tech Priests, frantically searching for our lost army.  With the signal from the call, they are finally able to pinpoint his location.\n\n\"The Tech Priests will navigate the way.  Keep me updated.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"  I leave the Barron in the hands of our capable crew.  At last we have the bulk of our soldiers once again to deploy.\n\nMoving back to the helm, I think upon our situation.  The majority of the cultists are charging the Marcocannons; that is our weakest defence with only the dredge able to guard it.  Outside the doors the crowds of heretics part as some sort of battering ram comes into view, looking to bring an alarming amount of force onto the sealed hatchway.  Meanwhile, the battle in the Cargo Bay is taking its toll on the Pilgrims; the majority are gathering around Quinlin who appears to be reciting some kind of sermon.  Curiously one of the hooded figures among the cultists is doing the same, blindfolded and chanting, like a dark reflection of our devout defenders.  If the pilgrims falter, the witches will surely have a clear run to the bridge.\n\n\"My Lord,\" once again I hear the Barron's voice, \"where are we needed?\"  I look from one fight to the other.  With no personal combat experience, I can only think on this logically.  Splitting the forces with their already lowered numbers runs the risk they will be overpowered from both sides.  If the witches capture the bridge then they will have conquered the heart of the ship.  This is obviously not desirable as, if this happens, it is highly likely they will kill me.  However, if our Marcocannons fall out of our control they will use them to destroy the Righteous Path.  We will lose the riches, our senior crew, and of course our Rogue Trader, the last of the Winter's lineage.  Without an heir, nothing we achieve on board will matter.\n\nI can't allow that to happen.\n\n\"Head to the Marcocannons.  There is a large number of vermin there.  Cut them down as fast as you can, then meet Quinlin straight up in the Cargo Bay.\"  I have to stall long enough for Quinlin to receive the Barron's backup.\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nBut how?  I can't leave the bridge myself.  The morale of these men depends on there being an active commander, even if I'm making things up as I go along.  I'm not skilled enough to charge head first into battle like the others anyhow.  My approach has to be smarter.\n\nIn the event that they do reach the bridge, I need to hold back the few soldiers stationed here in a rushed evacuation effort.  There may also be some Oathsworn still patrolling the Barron didn't sweep up available to help defend the Cargo Bay.  I connect once again to the vox in a last attempt, rallying all the forces we can to push the cultists back and gain control of this confrontation once and for all.\n\n\" My crew,\" I look over the faces with me on the bridge then peer through the screens, watching the men fighting the front lines.  \"You have all been told of the heretics and spies who have plagued our ship in recent days.  You have seen us do what we can to exterminate them.  They dare to stand up and face us!  They think they can take away your home - your lives - they think we would stand for it!  I will tell all of you right now - *I* will not stand for this.  We are all the Winter's family.\"\n\nI see the men in the Macrocannon chamber still, listening to my words.  The pilgrims in the Cargo Bay make obvious signs of prayer, fighting through their fatigue.\n\nI continue.  \"The ring leaders of this 'cult' are attacking the very men who tried to save you from this danger.  We need to respond.  Those of you who are able, show them that their dark ways do not frighten us.  Head to the Cargo Bay; show them your strength, defend your brothers - and they will be defeated.  Together we can rise and put these traitors in their place!\"\n\n[Start](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3dfr45/tales_from_a_seneschal_rogue_trader/) | [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3objbr/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_10/) | [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3spilb/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_12/) | [Last](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3xlc9d/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_16/)",

        "text": "So, the story starts about mid-session, today after school. I've been running this game for a while, and one of the guys who dropped out came back in today. After breaking the thrall which forced him to murder half of the party, a dwarven wizard associated with their patron popped up in an airship and resurrected the dead PCs. He took them to his base, and they rested. \n\nThen, they are rather forcibly awoken by this dwarven wizard screaming at him through a speaker to get to the landing platform of the base. He has locked himself in a vault and is busy arming himself. He requests 10 minutes.\n\nSo, the PCs charge out of the door to find [Lilith, the Former Queen of Hell](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/devil/devils-unique/devil-lilith-former-queen-of-hell-tohc) looking at them with a disgusted face. The cleric has a heart attack when he recognises her, and the swashbuckler tries and fails to seduce her. She then casts Mass Hold Monster, and only the martial artist, the bard, and his cohort make the save. \n\nAs she is about to cast fireball, the bard says: \"I roll Diplomacy to seduce her.\"\n\n\"Ok, you can try.\"\n\n...\n\n\"45.\"\n\n\"Ok. She rolled a 13, plus 32 so... Fuck.\"\n\nLilith locks eyes with the bard and raises her eyebrows. Clothes start to come off. \n\n\"Roll me Strength, Con, Charisma, and, because freaky shit, Dex.\"\n\nDon't remember exacts, but the final had no roll below a 20. \n\nWhat ends is a 36 minute blasphemy, in which the dwarven wizard is stunned, the swashbuckler jerks off 3 times, the warforged watches for science, and the cleric repeatedly casts Blindness/Deafness on himself. The bard successfully became the first mortal to survive fucking the Former Queen of Hell. \n\nAfter, Lilith is relatively amazed at the sexual proficiency of a mortal, and she hands him a rod. That rod? The Rod of Extradimensional Booty Call. \n\nThe party all got XP. He got bonus. \n\nAnd that was how they reached level ~~2~~ 9. ",

        "text": "I'm playing a 5e campaign with a bit of homebrew (described later) with me as a paladin and two friends, a wizard and a bard. The wizard is alright but lately, the bard has gotten into a nasty habit of killing people who we need to interrogate. The first couple of times it was funny, we didn't really Need the info anyway. But as we continued , he was slowing the campaign down by HOURS. \n\nSo I did what anyone do, I blunted all his weapons so he could only do non lethal damage. Whilst everyone was sleeping, I succeeded on the stealth check and spent the rest of the night blunting his weapons. At first he didn't notice any way, being a spellcaster but after a few encounters he wanted to land the killing blow on the big bad guy , the cm said that the best he could do was knock him out. Naturally, the bard felt pretty ripped off. I suggested it was probably some magic (seeing how the target was a necromancer or something). He was happy with that answer so we waited until he woke up to interrogate him. \n\nThis is where the homebrew comes into play, in our game, to the DM's digression, zone of truth can be used to force a character to speak if they fail on a charisma saving throw. We introduced this mostly because we wanted to be goodish characters and not do too much torture. \n\nAnyway we ask him the questions, no problems, this is probably the first successful interrogation we had.\n\nSo we are ready to move on when the DM asks me to roll a charisma saving throw \n\nMfw when I fail the throw .\n\nDm looks at me with pure evil, whilst the rest of the party are confused \n\n*heavy sigh* \n\n\"Bard, I may have been the one who blunted your weapons.\"\n\nMfw the group vote to banish my character from the party. \n\nHad to reroll and can't have a conversation with the bard without him making 10 perception checks.",

        "text": "I am a longtime Dnd and now pathfinder player. I had a newer group who needed one more player. The new group consisted of a mage, rogue, and fighter. They all quest to put up the highest damage and they all as people have strong personalities. \n\nThe player I invited was from my older groups who is much more experienced and also much more quite as a person. \n\nHe chooses a ranger and does not build for damage but for well rounded utility. This is the experienced player coming out. So the story goes on and they reach level 14 and all throughout this the mage, fighter, and rogue keep calling out the ranger for not keeping up in combat. They totally look over the advantageous positions he has put them in and how his ability to gather information and track has helped them.\n\nUltimately those 3 decide the ranger should not receive his cut of loot because he does not pull his weight in combat. My friend simply nods his head and smiles. This is where he wips out his phone and now only tells me what he does through text. That night as always he is first watch. \n\nThe party is woken to the terrible sound of crushing bone and splattering blood. The mage and fighter awaken to see the ranger standing over the corpse of the rogue with his head severed and an axe in his hand. He has clearly killed him in his sleep. \n\nThe hunter in his surprise round kicks the campfire into the faces of both the mage and fighter blinding them with fiery ash and runs into the darkness with his trusty wolf. \n\nThe party is losing its mind in real life. The rogue is furious complaining to both me and the ranger. The ranger sits and says nothing and after the yelling stops I simply say to the party (play on). The rogue in anger goes and starts playing Xbox or something. The fighter and mage knowing they are far superior in combat simply decide to kill the ranger and then try and resurrect the rogue later. \n\nThey pursue into the darkness. They cannot see shit. As before the ranger had been doing well putting them in advantageous positions. They are on their own trying to kill a very good and experienced ranger. \n\nAs they chase him he uses his wolf to lead them farther and farther into the woods by purposely making noise and what not. The ranger circles around sets all their gear on fire and steals their food and the rogues body predator style. \nHe also writes in the dirt (pay what you owe).\n\nThe wolf eventually shakes the two pursuers and it's a job just for them to find their way back. They see the message and all their ruined gear. They in their pride vow to never give the ranger anything but death. They are alone in the woods with no gear outside of what they are wearing (have all armor and such but no survival gear) and are being hunted by a 15  yr veteran of the game. \n\nCONTINUED\n\nThe fighter and Mage realize that they have to make it to civilization if they wish to survive because neither can hunt and as said before all their supplies are gone and if you think this mage learned anything along the lines of surviving in the woods when it comes to spells well let me just tell you he did not.\n\nThey stay up all night till first light and simply come up with the idea to head back to the town they had came from. This being their only option because they do not have a map and couldnt read it even if they did. The ranger in the mean time knows this is their only option and since one of his magical items makes him not need rest he starts prepping the trail to be as miserable and hazardous as humanly possible. He only had about 6 hours till daylight so he did not get a ton done but enough to make life miserable.\n\nThey head out at first light confident that in the daylight they could dispatch the ranger with ease. (Very true if he ever decided to stand and fight) They simply start walking the trail which is simply a cart path that is surrounded by woods. They are about a two day trip outside the town. Trap number 1 is triggered about an hour into the trip by the fighter who took point. Simple trap really just a bent tree limp with spikes. Takes light damage nothing to worry about. They continue walking and speaking about how they need to watch for traps (They suck at watching for anything). I offer them a +5 to seeing traps if they move at half speed. They take this offer. All the while the ranger is following them and watching.\n\nTrap 2. Greased pit fall. Fighter is still upfront and even with his +5 falls right in. and fails his reflex of course. The second the fighter falls the mage is struck in the shoulder blade by an arrow. The fighter has zero chance of climbing out of this simple yet effective trap. The grease combined with his weight makes this near impossible without assistance. The mage starts looking for the ranger. The ranger is sniping (One shot, then hide) Also he is tree teleporting (Short range teleport between trees).\n\nThe mage is looking from the general direction of the first shot and proceeds to take another arrow right in the back. He realizes his situation and decides to take cover. (Pointless because of teleport)\n\nThe fighter is failing climb check after climb check after climb check. In real life both of them are complaining how I need to stop this and how this is ruining the experience. The ranger player simply smiles and texts me and I look at them and simply say (Play On)\n\nThe Mage takes a Third Arrow to his back and looks and sees nothing but peaceful forest. He decides if there are no trees then there is nowhere to hide. He sets the forest ablaze. It burns and it burns violently. The ranger is forced to retreat but not before he lights an arrow on fire and lobs it into the grease pit. The fighter is now trapped in an inferno. The ranger was almost out of teleport anyway so this could not have gone on forever.\n\nThe mage sees the fighter burning and now decides something has to be done. He has no utility spells except for one (Wall of iron). He mainly used this in order to create his own cover. He uses the wall to cover up the hole like a lid. I was so glad he thought of something because things were not going well. The fire consumes the oxygen and goes out. The fighter is a crispy critter. He has lost about 75% of his health and has passed out due to lack of oxygen. He eventually awakens and swigs back some potions and digs stairs with his hands in the first to climb from his hole.\n\nThe ranger start his next set of traps during all this time. The fighter and mage realize they are only 3 hours into their journey and they have used half their potions and are still a long journey away from town. The realization starts to set in that guerilla warfare is the name of the game and they are bad at it and the ranger is good at it. They come to the realization there is a very real chance they do not make it out of here alive.\n\nThey decide to sleep in the pit tonight and watch the forest burn to nothing. The forest burns most of the night and covers several square miles. The ranger is actually concerned about the burning considering that it is the only thing keeping him from being engaged upon. He builds more traps along the path.\n\nThe fighter and mage brainstorm how to get out of this situation. The mage preps teleport and pitches the idea that he teleport to the town and hire help and come back with numbers. The fighter is reluctant about splitting up but eventually agrees considering that sticking together isnt helping either.\n\nthe mage teleports and hires help just as promised. They are still about a day and a half away from one another however. The fighter also realizes he cant follow the trial. His reflex is to low and now there is no help. He is still confident he can win a head to head battle however.\n\nThe ranger is shocked at the partys actions. He likes the fighter alone but hates the idea of help coming and him not going on the trail. He actually texts me( They are learning)\n\nThe fighter is now 2 days without food, or water, and has 2 health potions. He starts by simply walking along the side of the road about 10 feet away. This dodges all the rangers traps he had set up.\n\nThe ranger knows hitting the fighter is hard for him to do but knows the fighter is powerless to fight him in wooded terrain. He simply waits until the fighter is back into non burnt wooded terrain and begins.\n\nAn arrow hits the fighter in his breast plate and bounces off, another sinks deep into his side, and another bounces off his shoulder plate. He sees the ranger standing in a tree and charges. The rough terrain makes it slow going and more and more arrows poor into the fighter. most bouncing off but some are finding flesh. Just as the fighter reaches the tree the ranger simply steps into the bark and appears farther and farther away. The fighter can drop a tree in one swing but he cannot cut a whole forest. He chases without success for 3 iterations of tree teleporting. he realizes that 1.5 days is too long and that he will die one way or another if he keeps this up. He does the only thing he can. RUN\n\nThe fighter starts running in the direction he knows the help is coming making sure not to lose sight of the path but never on it. He feels the arrows driving against his back armor and feels the ripping of flesh every time one finds home.\n\nThe ranger using his slew of tracking abilities and favored terrain and enemy simply follows and keeps firing and teleporting. The fighter is running until I give him the bad news. No one can run forever, attrition starts to set in. His muscles burn with fatigue his flesh littered with arrows. He gets to about 10% health he has consumed all his potions and has only covered about half a days worth of distance because of the harsh terrain. He drops to his knees in exhaustion. knowing what is next. He removes his helmet looks to the sky and simply whispers (Pay what you owe) An arrow drives itself into his skull and he dies. The ranger drags his body to road so that its easily found. He now has only 1 target.\n\nDO TO SUPPORT I CONTINUE AGAIN\n\nThe mage with the hired help shows up a day later and sees the fighter littered with arrows and drenched in sweat. The guide in the group describes what happened based upon the tracks the fighter left behind. The fighter looks across the table in disgust of both me and the ranger. The ranger says nothing, in fact almost acts like the rest of the party is not even there. The fighter joins the rogue on the xbox. The rogue at this point is actually rooting for the ranger but is still kinda upset. The mage looks at me and says are you going to let this continue? he has ruined our campaign. I take a deep breath and say (Play On)\n\nThe mage grabs the fighters body and returns to the town without incident. He thought the ranger would attempt to stop them from getting there however the ranger isnt evil and sees the men the mage hired as innocent. Plus there are ranged units and about 30 of them. The ranger is good but that is a little much. \n\nThe mage makes it to town and prepares to bury his friend. (Remember the fighter rogue and mage are all friends in real life) He attends a funeral only to find a note left in his tavern room, written in blood is the words (PAY WHAT YOU OWE). the mage actually starts to go a little insane at this point. in real life and in the game. He becomes paranoid of dying. He refuses to leave his room at the tavern. He buys out all the other rooms, has his food delivered to him, has his food tasted by other beforehand. He expects desception at every turn. He litters the walls with magical traps and symbols he pulls from local shops an libraries. He turns the upper floor of that tavern into a fortress of magical protection. The ranger knows all this because he can gather information especially from a concerned waitress at the tavern. \n\nAfter 3 entire days of fortification and general paranoid behavior the ranger makes his move. He pays a local thief to cause a fire across town thats so big it cannot be easily put out. This happens and all the fire brigade responds causing chaos in the night upon the third day. Rubbernecking still occurs in pathfinder so even citizens flock to the scene if only to watch. The tavern sits alone in the night with only the mage dug in like an alabama tick upstairs. The ranger and his wolf sit outside with a torch. He walks in downstairs and proceeds to spread the finest booze the tavern has all over the bottom floor. He sets the tavern ablaze. It consumes the whole building in a matter of seconds. The speed is such that the mage finds himself quickly surrounded in an inferno. His magical traps do nothing to help him now. He is taking heat damage and is suphicating from the sheer amount of smoke. He waits thinking the ranger will attack at any moment. The ranger waits outside with an attack action prepped for any sight of the mage. The mage eventually realizes the ranger is not coming and attempts to teleport. The damage he is taking and the suphication are far to great to cast anything at this moment. He needs to get outside. \n\nHe jumps from his window. As he hits the ground a feels his flesh rip from an arrow strike to his back. He is at about 30% health. He stands and sees the ranger and wolf ready to engage. He wins his initiative and begins to cast his most devestating of spells. He then realizes he cannot feel the source of his power. It is locked away in some fashion. He is confused and then realizes the cruel truth. The ranger has antimagic arrows fashion (Cost him almost all his money and took 3 days to make) and one his lodged inbetween his should blades. He is nothing more than a regular joe without his gifts. The ranger puts away his bow and kneels next to his wolf. He points at the mage and simply says (Sick Em Boy)\n\nTHE END\n",

        "text": "I'm going to start this post with a comment about how one of the other players in our campaign is a Redditor who is in a solo sesh right now- so if you're Taylor stop reading this.\n\nNow, as for the tale...\n\nOur current group is a World of Darkness game with mixed modules. Our group consists of a cyberpunky vampire, a werewolf, who fits the definition of 'murderhobo' all too well, a Fae, who generally gets her way through cuteness and cunning, me, a mage who combines martial arts with life magic, and an aristocratic demon, who happens to be the DM's girlfriend.\n\nI'll probably compile a more thorough story of events when the campaign is done, but for now, I'm going to focus on a bit of the metagame.\n\nThe first couple of games, demon girlfriend was very vocally irate when she was put in a risky situation. Her character almost died in an intense battle, and she seemed noticeably peeved about it. One session later, demon manages to absorb power from the morning star (a serious stat boost). Werewolf, vampire and I were a little wary about demon girlfriend getting favoritism. \n\nA couple sessions later, I use my magic to sense entropic decay around us. While I did it to sense a weak-point in our environment, I ended up discovering something about the demon. \n\nThe fingers of her left hand were apparently attracting the focus of my spell.  I tried to probe about why exactly that was, but she did a series of rolls, even spending willpower, to dance around the topic with me.\n\nI thought it was a little weird, but we had monsters to kill. So I shrugged it off.\n\nIn any case, next session the demon reveals to us that her vessel is nearly consumed, and she needs to find a new one. My character is a greenhorn to the supernatural, so he kinda \"uh...huh's\" the situation and does his own thing.\n\nThe vessel the demon ends up taking is a mage. Giving a whole new set of powers to her, the rest of the group is now even more wary that the DM is playing favourites. The werewolf even says \"damn, you must be sleeping with the DM for that one!\"\n\nSo, fast forward a bit- Demon, Fae and I are in an intense battle. The demon tries to test out her new form, but suffers a botch.\n\nOne of the rings on her left hand explodes. It causes her a ton of damage.\n\nIt wasn't until the second ring exploded, and some manic giggling shadows came about on the ceiling that it occurred to me what was going on.\n\nThe entropy I felt earlier was predicting magical paradox...The demon may have inherited a magic user, but that magic user was teeming with paradox.\n\nOne more misroll, and a black hole opens up, sending us all catapulting into the umbra.\n\nThe vampire and werewolf weren't around for this. But it suddenly made me realize something about our DM. He'll give us things, but, in spirit with the game, will turn our desires against us.\n\nI was also told that another misroll and he'd have destroyed the demon's vessel, and put the rest of us in critical condition. And so, never again throughout this campaign shall I question the DM's favouritism. Quite frankly, being the favourite sounds scary...",

        "text": "First, I suppose I should preface this by saying that this was the first time most of us had played an RPG minus the GM, my best bro, best bro’s bro, and GM’s girlfriend, and this was the first time GM had GMed ever, so for the first few sessions, the rules were awkwardly traversed.  This led to several mishaps.  It is also partly why we were overburdened with people for most of the campaign. For this first session it was just me, my best bro, my bio bro, my best bro’s bro, and GM’s girlfriend.\n\n[A list of characters so you can maybe track what's going on.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BF0SzeD5wix2TWfWlGythD4Zz9WCmneDjylsuhr9Zh4/pub)\n\nWe opened up on a tavern, because of course we did. Quetz and Drino (lizardfolk) are at the bar fixing to order drinks. Ella is sitting at a table in the middle of a tavern. She notices a hooded figure enter. Interested, she buys him a drink. From the corner of the bar, Mal surveys the scene. Drino is, at this point, fumbling with the money for the drinks.  The lizards are unable to speak any common, and the concept of gold as currency is baffling.  The barkeep overcharges Drino for the drinks for his trouble in dealing with him.\nBack at Ella’s table, the hooded stranger tastes his drink with his mandibles.  She notices the two lizards happily down their beer. They are a long way from home and any sort of constant supply of marshgleam, the lizardfolk equivalent of moonshine. These lizards do love their marshgleam. The lizards recoil in disgust. This isn’t marshgleam. What they have just been given was water.  This simply will not do.\n\nQuetz raises his stone fist and breaks the bar like a twig.  Drino crumples his mug by squeezing it.  The barkeep, thinking he’s just been assaulted goes for the crossbow behind the counter.  Ella and the Bug step into mediate as the lizards have no way to explain their anger with words.  The Bug senses a lot of anger in the air. He infers that the lizards don’t like something about the alcohol and tells the bar owner such.  The bar owner doesn’t really care, and is still really pissed off about the lizards destroying his bar.\nElla sees that the bar is little more than a plank of wood between two beams and offers up some silver to pay for the damages, being sympathetic to just about anything with a face. The bar owner accepts the silver but still insists on having the lizards kicked out of the tavern.  It takes some coercing, but eventually, the point is gotten across to the lizards that they should really leave.  The bug takes his leave with them, realizing that he has just allied himself with unsavory folk, and they are as much strangers in this land as he.  Ella goes to sit back down at her table, with a hankering for a strong drink to forget.\n\n[Some mood music in case you're into it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeVRd_bBF00)\n\nThe lizards, bumping as many tables and chairs as they can along the way, head for the exit.  GM, at this point, realizes we are about to split up and has a drunkard bump into Drino. Drino takes the mug out of the drunkard’s hands, downs it in one gulp, and hands it back to him. The drunkard cracks him over the head with the mug. Cue bar brawl where the heroes are incapable of landing a hit on a bunch of drunken bastards.  Drino is hurting pretty quickly.\n\nMeanwhile, Mal is laughing and Ella is sighing.  Ella is not sighing for long.  Some local thief has noticed Ella flashing her coin at the barkeep.  He sticks a knife in her side under the cover of the brawl and politely requests that she give him all her money.  Ella ain’t having that shit.  “I try and bean him with my quarterstaff” Ella’s player said.\n\n“Roll for it.”\n\n“One”\n\nElla’s player looks pitifully at GM. GM is not a merciful god. “Your quarterstaff flies across the room.”\n\nMal finally decides to jump in now that there is a damsel in distress.  His player, having only played in murder fests before this campaign, wants to be as spectacular as possible. “I want to pin the thief to the wall with my trident.”\n\n“You wat?” says GM and assures him that nothing short of a natural twenty will successfully pin the thief to the wall without murdering him violently or otherwise missing.\n\nMal’s player doesn’t give a fuck, despite our warnings, and goes through with it.  He rolls spectacularly low.  GM is a slightly merciful god. “Your trident flies into the corner of the room and sticks into the wall, too high and hard to retrieve it easily.”\n\nNow, with more of our weapons scattered about the tavern than in our hands, we return to the main bar brawl. One of the drunks pulls out a knife and slashes at Drino with it, dealing just enough damage with all the non-lethal he’s already taken to knock him out cold. Quetz does not take kindly to this and punches the shit out of knife guy with his normal arm. Knife guy’s hurting, but he’s nowhere near out of the fight yet. He picks up the nearest stool. GM rolls. Nat 20. Fuck. Quetz gets knocked to the ground, but now he’s pissed.  Quetz goes enraged. I roll to punch the shit out of that motherfucker. Nat. Fucking. 20. Quetz gets up, cracks his neck, rolls his shoulders a bit, and punches that motherfucker across the room, breaking quite a few more things in the bar and possibly that poor sap’s body.\n\nMeanwhile, Ella is wrestling to get the thief off of her.  She feels assaulted, but can’t manage to get him off her. Mal, feeling like he’s fucked up in some way, looks around the room to see some way he can help out, and spots the bar owner fixing to shoot the big lizard that has wrecked most of his bar. Mal tackles that motherfucker. A crossbow bolt goes into the ceiling from the bar owner's crossbow.\n\nCue guards that GM had to bail us out in case he underestimated our stupidity and the nigh on invincible drunks proved to be too much (We had still not yet knocked out a single one).  They yell “Nobody move!”, and try to calm the situation. Eventually, they just tell everybody to go home.  We aren’t charged with anything (surprisingly), but Drino does end up taking up the one jail cell of the tiny hamlet whose tavern we’ve just destroyed so the local doctor can heal him as best he can and keep an eye on his progress. Quetz and the bug make camp on the outskirts of the town close to the jail, as they know they aren’t allowed to spend the night in the city. Mal asks if he can stay in the tavern. The barkeep basically tells him to fuck off because he tackled him and threw a trident in his wall. Mal makes a camp deeper in the woods. In the end, only Ella is allowed to stay in the tavern.\n\nIn the morning Quetz and the bug check on Drino.  Drino woke up sore, but was able to heal himself back up to full with religiosity and stuff. We meet Ella on her way out of town.  The bug explains to her that he is going east and she’s welcome to come along.  She agrees to come, though for what reason I’m not really sure.  Ella and the bug both feel responsible for the lizards in some way because they bailed them out.  The bug tries to explain best he can to the lizards what they’re doing by playing charades with sticks.  The lizards don’t get it, but it was okay, because they were going east too. Mal, for indiscernible reasons, decides to follow the small, unconventional party from the woods.\n\nAnd that’s how our “party” first got together.\n",

        "text": "This takes place at a different time but the same game as my last story. This LARP places primary focus in \"turku\", which is about complete immersion in the game, complete immersion in your character and becoming your character for the length of the event. I understood the concepts and became immersed many times, usually in social/political situations. This is one of them. For the sake of keeping the story in-character, no, she did not actually have sex with players for fake gold. At this LARP, sharing bunks with another player was how you represented being in a relationship with someone. No actual violence or torture was done to any player. Role-playing, acting, and high-quality prop materials were used to represent these actions.\n\nThis is not a happy story, but it's one of the most real experiences I had at this game. I hope that this story gets people interested in LARP.\n\nMy character was Leopold, a Slavic foreigner from a faraway land who were treated as rebels of the Empire for not conforming and bending the knee. As such, my character is inherently distrusted for his heritage but has made great strides in earning a reputation as the one you can trust. I've achieved such a reputation by faithfully serving noble lords and laying down my life on the front lines against necromancer and orcish threats. Being a second-class citizen has led me to appreciate all walks of life, finding friends in all races, cultures, and trades.\n\nOne of my friends was a young girl who we'll name The Prostitute who had no marketable skills or trades, usually spending her nights with one of the two local lords in exchange for food, wine, protection, and enough gold to cover her taxes. She was a great artist and I told her she should sell her works for an income, but she didn't have the drive to make it a career. I'd seen it for myself when an undead campaign had chased us from our town to the woods and we held an abandoned watch tower for the next day for safety until the horde ran through. With my ink and pen, she painted many things- the undead horde descending upon the town, the girl who worked for the magistrate, a portrait of my recently-deceased love.\n\nUndead attacks at this time were very commonplace. That same weekend we were chased from our homes, I was the last warrior standing at our campsite. Every other warrior had fallen, every civilian had ran or been struck down. I stood in front of the wooden three-wall structure with a sword in each hand while she hid in the corner under a pile of blankets. I held my ground for an admirable amount of time, but fatigue had caught me and I finally was swarmed. Luckily for her, the zombies hadn't spotted her and left once I was unconscious. \n\nThe lord she \"served\" was a very wealthy and very vain man. He was young and charming, a very skilled surgeon who would have no qualms with letting a man die could he not pay the cost, or could not recover well enough to work his debt off. Despite this, he and I were great friends at one time. He and I respected each other's combat abilities and work ethics and bonded over women and wine on many nights. Our falling out happened when he had betrayed me and organized a coup, stealing the crown from a baron who had named me his heir before his death mere sixty seconds beforehand. His twenty men had slain my ten in front of me, but spared me if I were to uphold the lie that he were named heir. There was no writ, there was no proof beyond the word of the witnesses- I being the only one not in the conspiracy. As you can imagine, our friendship was strained. \n\nDuring a town meeting, both The Prostitute and this lord, who we'll call The Baron, were not present. They were in a nearby cabin, presumably making business arrangements. The meeting was disrupted when the door opened in a huff, and The Prostitute left the cabin holding her small box of possessions and looking mortified. It seems that The Baron had no longer needed her services and fired her, sending her walking with shame to her own cabin. Nobody said anything,  but nobody had forgotten. Everybody saw.\n\nNearly a year later, I'm serving a new Lord, The Magistrate, who I served only to protect myself. He was corrupt, morally and financially, he had tricked me into murdering his cousin, a man who I found out later to be a returning war hero who held a seat of power this Lord wanted. He always got what he wanted, and when he didn't, there would be hell to pay. The Prostitute made the mistake of refusing him her services.\n\nShe came to me in the middle of the night, woke me in my bunk, crying because the magistrate had forced himself upon her and when she refused, he told her he wanted at least one kiss before she could go, or the future would look dark for her. She appeased him with a kiss and came to me. I've never been much one for being able to comfort others but I was the only friend she had. I held her in an embrace and told her to stay by my side when he was in town.  He wouldn't try anything in front of me. I was his most faithful servant, but I was also the one who knew his darkest secrets. She shook her head and told me that she needed to speak with The Baron. I encouraged her to stay with me for the evening and that seeing him wouldn't help. She told me it was okay, she only wanted to talk. I should have stopped her, but I didnt. I only told her to be careful and don't make any rash decisions. I watched her go and thought to myself jokingly \"I hope she doesn't murder him.\"\n\nI was awoken a few hours later by one of the magistrates men. The Prostitute had brutally murdered The Baron and the doctors counted thirty two separate stab wounds on his chest. My heart sank, this was the end. I was briefly questioned by the magistrate,  making a token effort to somehow implicate me in the plot but we all knew while I hated The Baron for his betrayal, I would never murder. Things weren't so optimistic for The Prostitute. Shed been running in the woods for an hour before they found her and returned her. They were going to charge her with murder and execute her. They were also going to charge her with necromancy, which Old Law requires an extensive, torturous process involving flaying and removal of hands and tongues to prevent spellcasting in the afterlife.\n\nI knew who created the necromancy charges. I argued in her favor, and I was the only one. As evidence, the put forward her art- the picture of the undead horde- about how every time there was an undead attack in our town, she remained unharmed, about how nobody would benefit more from the death of a baron than the Necromancer who looks to control our lands. \n\nI argued for her, I showed them her book of art, I told them of how she hid in the darkness, I told them how everybody who wanted power would be glad to see a rift, would be glad to see a barony fight itself to death to name a new Baron. The others all looked at me, pained. They wanted to agree with me. They knew she killed The Baron, but they knew she wasn't a necromancer. I could see it in their eyes. But the magistrate was there. This was a sign of submission, this was fear.\n\nThe magistrate placed his hand on my shoulder and shook his head. In the most condescending tone he could muster, he looked me in the eyes. \"I know you loved her, son, but the truth is there for all to see. If you continue to fight this, you will meet the same fate. I cannot protect you when the rumors reach our King that one of *your* kind is fighting for a trial for a necromancer.\" One of others mouthed the word \"please\" to me behind his back. To this day I regret it- I submitted. I knew the truth and I let it happen. \n\nThe trial was skipped and the verdict was given within an hour. She was taken by two town guards, two doctors, a priest, and The Magistrate to an abandoned abbey in the woods where they chained her to a chair, blindfolded her, beat her, cut out her tongue, flayed her arms and legs and cut off her hands.. The guards were there to prevent any heroes from stopping the punishment, the doctors were there to ensure she didn't die from shock before the punishment was complete. The priest was there so the gods could watch.\n\nI was ordered to stay in town, I did as I was told. I drank. I drank a lot. It was the only thing keeping me in that cabin. Some of the others wanted to talk, but I pushed a chest in front of the door to keep it shut. I didn't want to talk to anybody who let this happen and deep down I knew that I could have still fought. \n\nIn the morning, the priest awoke the people and urged us that we were to rise to witness an execution. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. They must have placed another on trial, surely they- I walked outside and there she was, kneeling with a blindfold, no tongue, no hands, and her arms tied behind her back. The priest gave the guard captain blessings to allow him to commit the execution. The magistrate gave his speech once we all gathered- The Prostitute was a necromancer. She murdered the Baron for the dark lord and this is the fate that all necromancers will receive. He gave the nod to the executioner to finally end her suffering.\n\nI should have said something again, but I didn't. I was afraid of ending up in the same place. I've held dozens of undead at bay and fought orcs barehanded and the thought of ending up like that, and a sea of my peers watching in silence terrified me. I didn't say anything but I swear she knew I was there, she looked right at me even with the blindfold on. The executioner swung his blade. She fell motionless to the ground without even a whimper. Her body was dumped in the river, unfit to be buried, and The Magistrate would not speak to me for the rest of the week. Probably for the best, I had nothing to say.\n\nI have two regrets from my experiences in that game- I regret that I let this happen because I was afraid. I regret that I later had the chance to put an end to the Magistrate's life and I failed to do so.\n\nBut that's another story for another day.",

Any way they are ok, good role players but get a bit crazy in combat, never really think it through, go in guns blazing.\n\nEvery time.\n\nThe party is made up of a paladin (me, typical white knight), a ranger (loner with arrows), a wizard (who spends a majority of his time prestigitating everyone and anything just to mess with them) and a bard (inspiring the wizards shenanigans). \n\nAnyway, we are all in this town just finished off our \"main\" quest and have a fair bit of freedom in what we do. This is the most freedom we have had thus far and because the group are pretty new to Dnd, it was madness. Straight up, the wizard and the bard spent half their time toying with people in stupid ways before realising (DM pointed out) that they should probably invest in potions, weapons etc, they found the closest merchant and decided, instead of buying, to set up a heist. But it wasn't a heist. They just ran in and tried to grab everything they could. They failed. Miserably and burnt all their spells just trying to escape. They need to take a long rest so that leaves me and the ranger. We are both up for making some cash and seek out the mercs of the town. They tell us of some druid terrorists in the city who are supposed to be meeting tonight blah blah blah go take them out for us for 100 gp blah blah blah\n\nDM asks if we want to join the rest of the party and take a long rest. \n\nNow where is the fun in that?\n\nAsk for a description of the leader\n\nMe and the ranger head to the jail of the city.\n\nDM and party look puzzled, but dm goes through his notes. \n\nI talk to the jail warden\n\n\"Druid terrorists?

        "text": "And so we continue the tale of how some nutters beat up some Nazis. This time, some new friends join the fray.\n\n**The important stuff so far**\n\n**Spooky Squad**- An international Allied squad during WW2 that took every freak of nature under the stars and sent them in an fascist-wardly direction to either do covert jobs behind the lines or directly onto the lines to cause as much mayhem as possible. Usually works in small units.\n\n**Scratch**- A British matter mage and a private in Spooky Squad. Likes radios, jazz, and not being in constant danger. The latter two have been in short supply since arriving in Nazi occupied France.\n\nWhen we last left off, Scratch had just been deployed to Saint Quentin, France to steal a code book. Having spent the night in the upper room of a tavern, he was refreshed and ready for another day behind enemy lines. After leaving the tavern, ignoring the Nazi soldiers who were already drinking at nine in the morning, Scratch headed for the river where he met his contact yesterday. While having another meal of spam and crackers, tossing some to the birds, the man from yesterday showed up on a bike. They exchanged code word-riddled small talk in german and the man invited Scratch to his place. Scratch was finally about to start work on the thing he was here for in the first place, about bloody time.\n\nThey stopped at a farm house a few miles from Saint Quentin. Upon entering the basement, the man promptly drew a gun on Scratch and told him in english  to sit down in the chair. Scratch calmly sat down and let himself be tied up and searched by the other two who came out of the shadows. It was standard stuff really, nothing to get worked up about. After a pleasant conversation at gunpoint, all suspicions were cleared and introductions were made. The man in charge, Cecil, was glad Scratch had made it to support them but had some bad news. Apparently, the plane carrying the others from Spooky Squad that were supposed to help him out had been shot down and was being searched for by enemy troops. Determined to not have to assault an entire base by his lonesome, Scratch agreed to search for the plane using the last transmission before it went down. Before he and Cecil went out, he was given an M1911 for defense, it felt good to have at least some proper defense against the baddies they were no doubt about to face.\n\nNight fell and the two began their search. They finally located the wreck using transmissions overheard from troops in the area and found that the Nazis had gotten there first. Troops had surrounded the area and there was quite a commotion. It was highly likely that the support was either captured or dead from the crash, which would suck slightly more than the first option. Then, Scratch noticed a truck being loaded up with bodies and an officer step into the passenger seat. Being notably suspicious, the two decided to tail the truck. After some tense moments avoiding some tanks rolling down the road, they arrived near the enemy camp. It had two buildings, a barracks and communication supposedly, a spotlight over the entire camp, some machine gun nests, and a few soldiers patrolling. It was time for an infiltration.\n\nAfter crawling through the tall grass before Big Boss made it cool, they ran into a predicament. They had to quickly get to the door of the communications building but the way was well lit and they needed a distraction. Scratch looked at the spotlight and focused. The spotlight suddenly doubled in intensity, getting the attention of every awake soldier to a burst of neins and schnells. Scratch quickly created a sound bubble around the door and entered while Cecil followed behind. There were two soldiers in the building, one working the radio in another room and another asleep on a cot by the door. Scratch swiped some important looking keys and headed for the one room where he didn't hear anything. He dropped another sound bubble around that room and went inside.\n\nInside he found two men unconscious in cages. The first was absolutely massive, sporting rippling muscles, slightly silvering hair, and a look on his sleeping face that seemed to infer that he would tear you in half if you woke him. The other was a wiry looking man with slim features and disheveled hair that made him look like he had been in the woods for too long. They definitely didn't look German though, so Scratch unlocked the cages and motioned for Cecil to come over.\n\nCecil- \"Christ, that one is huge.\"\n\nScratch- \"Well guess what, you get to wake him up.\"\n\nCecil- \"What!\"\n\nScratch was rarely ever bossy, only when he was in a bad mood or *really* didn't want to do something. Scratch quickly went over to the other guy while Cecil sighed and prepared for the worst. The other guy was out cold, most likely from the crash, but some good slapping got him back to his senses. Before Scratch could ask any questions though, Cecil had landed a particularly vicious slap on the big guy who woke up with a start.\n\nImagine a large Italian man being slapped awake and then he starts to spout various profanities that no one in the room can understand. All the tension of the situation went out the window. Like letting out a squeaky fart in the middle of an execution. Good thing the sound bubble prevented anyone outside the room from hearing, otherwise they would have been in a lot of trouble.\n\nAfter getting the big guy to calm down, questions were asked and answered. The two were indeed from Spooky to support Scratch on his mission, but their gear had been taken and they needed it back. So they piled out of the room and began infiltration part 2: theft edition. First was the other room where that one soldier was working communications. Scratch crept into the room and snuck up behind him. He then pressed the barrel of his pistol to the back of the soldier's head, instructed him to get on the ground, then motioned for the big guy to knock him out. \"Trust me, this is much better than a bullet\" Scratch said to the soldier on the ground. Then the big guy threw a punch hard enough to break the floor underneath the soldier's face. \"Okay, maybe I was wrong\" Scratch commented, stunned at the sheer power behind the blow. Scratch went over to the table where the radio equipment was. There, he found some troop movements, a letter that the other guy said he needed, a pistol that the big guy immediately snatched up, and a small bag. Scratch looked inside the bag and found it was packed with Comp C. Well then. The big guy said this was also his and grabbed it as well. Scratch couldn't find his voice to make a retort.\n\nThe next step was getting back the rest of the equipment those two had brought. This time, Scratch and the other guy went to grab it while Cecil and the big guy went on ahead. Scratch asked the other guy if he had any way to grab their gear from the barracks in the middle of the guarded, well lit camp. Fortunately, he did, though that didn't really surprise Scratch. Everyone in Spooky was a freak of nature as far as he could tell so there had to be something up with these two. Turns out other guy happened to be a space mage (that's space as in time and space, not outer space) and was completely prepared for this situation. Other guy simply reached his had out and it disappeared into the barracks, grabbing all their gear and, an owl. Other guy apparently had an owl. Neat. The two saddled up the bags of gear and went to meet up with Cecil and big guy.\n\nThey all met about a quarter mile away from the camp. Big guy was ecstatic to get his bag and immediately pulled out a Tommy gun and began looking it over. Christ, this guy was seriously heavily armed. Other guy just looked over his pistol and fed his owl. Finally, Scratch remembered to ask for their names, though he had gotten used to big guy and other guy. The big guy was an Italian named Marco and the other guy was a Frenchmen by the name of Maron. After basic intros were given, everyone began the trek back to home base. There was a brief incident where they were almost caught by a tank division due to Marco's fear of spiders, but they made it back safe. Scratch collapsed on one of the mattresses while Marco and Maron were introduced to the rest of the group. Scratch could tell things were only going to get weird and complicated from here on.",

        "text": "I had a rather interesting evening with my latest addiction, Monster Hunter. Thought I'd drop by and share the story with you guys.\n\nThe evening began with me needing some specific monster parts. You see, for the uninitiated, in Monster Hunter you don't just buy your gear from the store; the vast majority of it must be forged from pieces of slain monsters. Much of the game entails fighting to gather the materials you need. In this case, I needed Ebonshells from a monster called Brachydios.\n\n[Brachydios is a bit of a handful.](http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130301171320/mogapedia/fr/images/thumb/e/e5/Brachydios_Artwork.png/500px-Brachydios_Artwork.png) Imagine the following: we have a large, bipedal reptile monster with a spiked tail. The most prominent features, though, are the two hyperdeveloped forearms and the large (but blunt) single horn protruding from the head.\n\nBrachy, you see, has a bit of an explosive personality. He secretes a special mucus from the horn and forearm hammers, and that mucus forms his primary weapon. Primed with a compound found in Brachy's saliva, the mucus is both sticky and highly explosive. If he clips you with an attack from his horn or hammers, he'll slime you with the mucus, and if you don't take steps to shake it off in time, it'll detonate for a big chunk of your health. Couple that with the fact that Brachy hops around like a championship boxer and attacks very aggressively, and you have a fairly nasty fight.\n\nAfter several failed attempts of my own, I started to get discouraged. I was just off my game for the night, but I still needed those shells, so I hopped online and fished around for a group planning on fighting the same monster.  As luck would have it, I was able to find such a group with ease, so I joined up with them.\n\nIt was almost comical. The difference between hunting a monster by yourself and hunting with a group is like night and day. Unlike before, when I was getting thrown around and having a hard time finding openings to attack, this group was on him quickly and aggressively, and we chewed into him like we'd just been served a fine meal. One hunter with a staff-like weapon called the Insect Glaive vaulted off the ground and onto the Brachy's back, letting them use their knife to temporarily cripple the beast and drag him to the ground. Once he was down, I waded in with my greathammer and just started smashing his head with it while the rest of the hunters started cutting into his body; by the time he recovered and found his footing again, my hammer cracked into his teeth on his way up and knocked him silly. He staggered around for a few moments while the rest of the hunters finished dragging him down, and he finally stopped moving.\n\nWhen we returned to the Gathering Hall, though, I noted that one of the hunters was mourning about a specific part he needed which he wasn't getting. See, each monster generally has multiple types of material it can drop, generally of differing rarities. The Ebonshell I needed wasn't a terribly uncommon material, and it can be harvested through carving from the bodies of dead monsters, the normal way of receiving materials. The other hunters, though, needed a material called the Pounder, a much rarer piece of the beast's carapace which can only be harvested from the forearm hammers, which had to be shattered while the monster was still alive. We were killing Brachydios so efficiently that frequently we were only able to shatter one of his forearm hammers, meaning that the hunters seeking Pounder pieces were only getting a chance at one non-guaranteed drop. It was time for a change.\n\nAs we were about to leave for our next run, I told the other hunters to wait for me. I left the Gathering Hall and exchanged my [Volvidon armor](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/monsterhunter/images/7/7a/MH3U_Volvidon_Armor.png/revision/latest?cb=20130706174259), a red scalemail built from the plating of a giant armadillo-type monster which was impervious to Brachy's explosive mucus, for [chitin armor](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/mogapedia/images/6/64/M_scylla_ken.png/revision/latest?cb=20141207114047&amp;path-prefix=fr) constructed from the pieces of a giant jumping-spider called a Nerscylla. \n\nThis was a very special set of armor. I'd put it together some time ago as I was working to learn the nuances of a new weapon type. The gem slots in the armor were filled with pieces that would grant it unique support capabilities, so that even if my skills with the new weapon were poor, I could still support my allied hunters in that way. While wearing this set, I could look at my map and instantly know the location of any monster in the area. The well-articulated fingers allowed me to easily manipulate complex devices like monster traps to lay them much more quickly than normal, and more importantly, the armor also gave me the ability to know exactly when a monster was *susceptible* to those traps. This was crucial, as the key problem was that we were attacking Brachydios so aggressively that it was dying before it could give any of the cues that monsters give when they're weakened enough to subdue.\n\nIn short, as I explained to the other hunters once I returned, with this gear I could solve the problem we were having in which Brachydios died too quickly to give the rewards they needed. A hunt doesn't have to end with the death of the monster; it's possible to take them alive by binding them with a monster trap and hitting them with enough tranquilizer, and when you bring a monster home alive, they're processed professionally, allowing you to acquire materials that can't be found by simply carving into the beast's corpse with your belt knife.\n\nThis time, without the heavier armor and blast protection of my Volvidon armor, I fought more cautiously and let the other hunters take a more aggressive role. I'd traded in my heavy hammer for a shortsword coated in paralytic venom and a shield as well, reasoning that I'd need the lighter and speedier weapon to keep myself safe. Things took a little longer without the heavy blows of my hammer, but I kept half an eye on the indicator, and at the appropriate time I gave my fellow hunters the signal. One of the others vaulted at him, staggering him slightly and distracting him, while I darted underneath the monster to lay an electrically-charged shock trap under his feet. Once that was done, the only thing left was blasting him with the portable tranquilizer gas bombs Hunters use to disable their quarry.\n\nAt the hunter's hall, there was much rejoicing. The professional processors had proven much more successful at harvesting Pounder shells than any of us had been, and the rare material was abundant for all of us after just a few more hunts. One of our number left the Gathering Hall, having gathered all the material he needed. One more, however, piped up; she needed a specific type of ore now, a rare variant found on the Heaven's Mount hunting ground.\n\nI nodded and posted a simple Gathering quest for the Heaven's Mount; these quests were usually simple milk runs, in which you're given quite a sizable amount of time to run the area to gather materials like plants and ores needed for forging new equipment. So we departed along with her.\n\nI made a quick circuit of the area before settling in on a ledge to watch a herd of docile herbivorous monsters amble past while I waited for the others, keeping an eye on my map every so often. See, while these gathering quests are generally quiet, they aren't always quiet. Occasionally, a wandering monster might appear on the map to cause trouble.\n\nI looked up as I heard a roar in the distance, and my eyes nearly popped out as I looked down at the icons on my map. A monster had burrowed out of the ground almost right on top of one of the other hunters. But not just any monster. Oh, no.\n\nIt was a [Deviljho.](http://orig00.deviantart.net/d1eb/f/2014/016/d/a/the_mighty_deviljho_by_pachyrhinosaurus-d72i2wf.png)\n\nMean, green, and composed of little more than muscle and teeth, Deviljho is practically legendary in Monster Hunter circles. They are very large and very powerful, and they have a voracious appetite that makes them *incredibly* aggressive towards anything that might constitute a food source. They'll eat anything as long as it's meat; they've even been seen taking bites out of their own severed tails or knocked-out captured monsters if they get hungry enough.\n\nMeanwhile, we had one Hunter whose guild rank was low enough that it was conceivable they'd never even *seen* a Deviljho, one experienced hunter, and me, wearing a set of support-oriented gear with barely two-thirds the defensive power that I'd want going into a fight with a Deviljho and wielding a glorified toothpick.\n\nWe went for it. And it was magnificent, friends. I was dodging and weaving around the thing's legs, stinging it with my sword and trying my best to avoid hits, then chugging potions like mad whenever I failed. The Glaive users were vaulting at it from high ground and trying to bring it down without engaging it for prolonged bouts of close combat. This was nowhere near the kind of stomp we'd given Brachy; Deviljho was much too vicious and tough for us to overwhelm like that.\n\nOur youngest Hunter made a wrong step, and Deviljho rammed into her, smashing her against a wall. It turned away from her limp body as the extraction team showed up to drag her away from the field to recover, then leaped at me. The lunge pinned me to the ground, and the monster started leaning down, drooling, to take a bite. He was too heavy to shake off, so I reached into my pouch with the only free hand I had available, and threw a dung bomb into his eyes. He roared in fury, but it got him to back off and let me up off the ground.\n\nI still had a problem, though. His acidic drool had coated my armor, and I could tell it had eaten away a good chunk of the meager defensive power it did have. Worse, I didn't have any of the special seed oil that would let me scrub away the acid and repair the damage, so I had to be even more careful than before. Now I was reduced to cautiously climbing ledges and keeping my distance from Deviljho, because I'd exhausted my potions and couldn't hope to survive another solid hit.\n\nOur hero was our third hunter, and he was a sight to see as he fought with the Deviljho. His armor was incredibly fine stuff that let him absorb blows with ease, and he used it to go much more aggressively against the monster than we were able to. \n\nFinally, I saw the indicator that told me the Deviljho was weakening. I rolled underneath him as he attacked another hunter, and quickly set up a trap under his feet before he could move. Before anyone could react, I'd shoved a pair of tranq bombs right into the creature's mouth; when the trap went off, briefly electrocuting him, he bit down and blew the tranqs. Bluish-white smoke steamed from his mouth as his eyes rolled and he toppled over.\n\nWe all cheered over the sleeping giant... but we also didn't waste any time summoning the extraction team's wagons to ride us home, because not one of us wanted to be there when he woke up.",

        "text": "Note: Apologies in advance if some names seem out of place. I tried to catch them all, but keeping the names Krug and Kurg straight, as well as Gurk and Gork, can be quite troublesome. Just note that if it involves being strong, it's Krug. If it involves eating, it's Kurg. If it involves being moderately helpful and overly happy, it's Gurk. If it involves eating and it's not Kurg, it's Gork. Usually. Let me know if you notice any odd spots! \n\nIt's a glorious new day. The heralds have put out a call for adventuring parties of all shapes and sizes to go to the Capital and take part in Cayden Cailean's Great Adventurers Tournament, and the winners will receive gold and riches and glory unlike any before! Kind of. But our story begins elsewhere...\n\nKrug and Gurk (as well as their brother Kurg, who had suddenly shown up the day before), were being told by their supervisor, Paladin Sanders, that there weren't many fights to be had around these parts. Everything was going pretty well for the villagers here actually, so there were no great quests for gold, or rather shinies, to be had. Krug and Gurk did not understand, as there was always fighting somewhere. So they visited the local Guild, and indeed, there was a **big** fight happening soon. This was wonderful news to Krug and Gurk.\n\nKrug: Big fight where?\n\nGuild Leader: Uhhh, the Capital. You...want to....go?\n\nKrug: Yes. Go big fight.\n\nThe Guild Leader looks at Paladin Sanders, who simply throws up his hands in exasperation.\n\nSanders: I just make sure they do good things rather than bad things. It’s been sanctioned by the Paladin’s guild…somehow, and I need *anything* to keep them busy and not bored. You wouldn’t like them when they’re bored.\n\nThe Guild Leader shakes his head and agrees; Krug and Gurk (and Kurg) will go to the capital, and attempt to enter the Tournament. \n\nThe next day, the various groups are gathered onto a very large cart. Approximately 50ft by 50ft, with a very large tarp over it, some 10 to 20 wheels, and 6 horses pulling it along, it was obviously the communal transportation. Everyone was being loaded on to this massive cart, or rather, almost everyone. Next to the main cart, there was a smaller cart, one for about 5 or so people, much fancier than the communal cart. Getting into it were what seemed to be nobles of some kind, a mix of male and females in very fancy armour. One of the females looks over, looking down upon the so-called ‘competition’. Gurk looks over at her, smiles, and waves. The woman shudders with disgust, and looks away. Gurk continues smiling. Krug looks around at all the strong people, and shaking his head. No one was as big as Krug. Kurg just grunts and shuffles along. Sanders shakes his head, and pulls on the chains holding the three Orc Warcats: Mittens, Frank, and Gork. Leashed and muzzled, the cats looked angry, just like always, but they went along anyways. As long as they stayed close to their Masters, there was bound to be food eventually. There always was.\n\nThe carts are loaded, the Noble cart departing first. Krug, Gurk, Kurg and the rest occupy the back corner of the cart, carving out their own Orc-ish space. They kept all their weapons and armour, because what Orc would let it leave their sight, and the Paladin held onto the cats. Gurk and Kurg don’t do much on the initial part of the trip, mostly eating and sleeping. Krug on the other hand, looks across the way and notices the biggest Fighter in the caravan, and just starts staring. Nothing happens for a few minutes, until one of the Fighter’s friends nudges him and whispers. The Fighter looks up.\n\nFighter: Uhhhhh, can I help you?\n\nKrug: I could take you.\n\nFighter: Excuse me?\n\nKrug: You. Me take you. Me stronger.\n\nFighter: Oh. Uh, I mean, you’d have a pretty good fight.\n\nKrug: Yes. Fight good. But me stronger.\n\nFighter: Yes…good fight…&lt;whispering to his friend&gt;*what do I do?*\n\nFighter’s Friend: *I don’t know, I didn’t even know we were supposed to be chatting.*\n\nFighter: Umm, so we’re the King’s Pauldrons, Fighter’s Guild. How about yourselves?\n\nKrug: You Kings? Where shinies?\n\nFighter: I…what? No, we’re not Kings. We’re the people who fight **for** the King.\n\nKrug: If not King, then why name? Stupid name.\n\nFighter: Yes. Sure. That. So what about yourselves?\n\nKrug: We KGB.\n\nFighter: Who? We’ve never heard of you.\n\nKrug: **We** KGB.\n\nKrug gestures to him and his brothers, including the three cats.\n\nFighter: Oh. That’s uh, nice. What does it stand for?\n\nKrug: Me Krug, he Kurg. K. He Gurk. G. We Brothers. B.\n\nFighter: So why not KKGB?\n\nKrug: Too many letters. Would forget.\n\nFighter: Ah. Um. Alright then.\n\nAt this point the Fighter pulls out a book. Krug keeps staring for a few more minutes until he nods to himself and starts sharpening his weapon.\n\nIt’s a two week trip to the Capital, with various pit stops along the way. On the seventh day, the Cart stars to slow down unexpectedly until it comes to a complete stop. A commotion is heard outside. Krug gets up to go look. He gets out and looks to the front of the cart. A tree seems to have fallen onto the road.\n\nKrug: &lt;yelling&gt; **Tree on road! Gurk, Kurg, help lift!**\n\nThe three Orks shamble out of the caravan, and go over to lift the tree. Compared to their immense strength, this tree is nothing. Kurk even feels the need to eat the tree, and promptly takes a bite out of it. Kurg has proven his dominance over the tree. The three Orcs proceed to lift the tree; two with their hands, one with his teeth. Suddenly, arrows fly out the Forest, aimed at the three big Orcs. The arrows aimed at Gurk and Kurg bounce off their wooden armour. Krug takes one to the shoulder. He seems woozy for a moment, then shakes it off.\n\nKrug: &lt;yelling&gt; **MITTENS!**\n\nSanders: **Oh fuck!**\n\nSuddenly an Orc Warcat barrels out the carvan, coming to a stop as it rounds the corner. Krug points at the forest.\n\nKrug: HUNT!\n\nMittens takes off into the forest. Krug soon follows, but not before taking another arrow to the chest. Gurk and Kurg decide that this fallen tree would make an excellent battering ram. They peer into the forest, and unable to see anything, and promptly charge the nearest tree. The impact is enough to immediately uproot the tree, causing it to fall into the forest.\n\n???: WHAT THE HELL!\n\nAt this point, Kurg and Gurk, unsuccessful in defeating an enemy, drop the tree. Frank and Gork had arrived at their master’s side as the fighting began in earest, and the two Orcs dispatch their companions into the woods.\n\nGurk: Frank, search destroy.\n\nKurg: Gork, eat.\n\nKurg decides that there must be at least one archer in the trees, and promptly takes off, climbing at a surprising pace. He climbs the tree, and finding no archers, immediately jumps to the next one to continue his search.\n\nMore arrows connect, hurting Krug once again, as well as Kurg. Kurg becomes a little unsteady, not able to shake off whatever was on the arrows, but holds steady.\n\nMittens catches the scent of an enemy, and charges him down. He promptly bites down on some odd looking brush, immediately drawing out a curse as one of the archers stands up. Krug sights his target and charges as well, unfortunately stepping on a bear trap along the way. He falters and misses with his deadly Orc Double Axe, the bear trap cutting deeply into his leg. Gork has some success as well, hunting down another archer via his powerful nose, swiping at him and causing the masked man to leap up in surprise, letting off a string of curses. The man decides to take a shot at the tree climbing Ork, who must be the cat’s master, but misses, allowing Gork to further wound his distracted foe.\n\nFrank unfortunately, cannot find his foe. He seems to have caught a scent, but the poor Warcat cannot find the source. Gurk however, has no such problems finding a target, the Ork having laid site on the enemy that Mittens had just found. Letting out a guttural Orc war cry, he charges. Krug joins him in this, letting off a cry of his own. The Archer looks confused for a moment. He never stood a chance.\n\nAs Gurk charges, his muscles seem to bulge with further strength, Krug’s muscles growing with them. As the two Orcs enter proximity, they seem to grow even bigger. With a mighty upwards swing, Gurk’s Axe cleaves effortlessly through the Archer, his body standing there for a moment, motionless. The two halves fall away from each other, leaving a bloody mess on the ground. Krug let’s off a second yell, shouting to the Heavens at this glorious kill.\n\nThe remaining Archer reveals himself, leaping up in fear and shock. Frank growls at him. The second Archer, Gork’s food, takes off running. \n\n2nd Archer: &lt;yelling&gt; We’re not getting paid enough for this!\n\n???: &lt;yelling from inside caravan&gt; Do you’re damn jobs!\n\nSanders: &lt;yelling&gt; **EXCUSE ME?**\n\nThe third archer hesitates, unsure of what he should do, but obviously afraid. This is all Krug needs. Still held down from the bear trap around his leg, Krug knows he can’t stab the enemy. So instead, he releases his grip on his Axe, pulls a Chakram off his harness, and gives it a mighty throw.\n\n3rd Archer: Oh.\n\nThe Chakram flies straight and true, burying itself in the Archer’s chest. He goes down quickly and quietly, with barely a gurgle. The fight is over as almost as quickly as it started, though not without Krug hurting something bad. Mittens is told to fetch Krug’s Chakram (which Mittens huffs at, eating the dead Archer’s hand as he does so), while Krug removes the bear trap around his leg. Once everything is in order, Krug heads for the Paladin, because the Paladin can glow, and glowing means less bleeding.\n\nThe other Adventurer’s seem to pile out of the caravan in the hurry, like they were trying to get away from something. The Orcs take no notice of this as the Adventurers go to chase down the one that got away.\n\nAs Krug and Mittens round the corner to climb back into the cart, they notice something. The Paladin is unconscious and bleeding from a head wound, and three figures are standing in the corner. They seem huddled around a glowing circle, with one in a cloak scribbling in chalk, another in Robes chanting or something, and the third just sort of watching. Krug stands there in indecision for a moment, but figures that the bleeding paladin is not a good thing, and attempts to upset the caravan by chopping it in two, yelling for his brothers at the same time. \n\nInstead, he promptly misses the caravan completely, overbalancing himself, and letting out more of a gurgled cry than a yell. This alerts everyone immediately, in a much less effective fashion. All three figures turn around, and the robed one flicks her hand. Grease erupts in arcane glory, covering Krug from head to toe, but he somehow keeps his balence. The fighter draws his sword.\n\nFighter (not the big one): Oh crap. I’ll handle this. \n\nThe fighter charges Krug, burying his sword deeply in the Orc’s chest. The Orc smiles. Where a normal man would be on the ground unconscious, the Orc just takes it in stride. Yelling, his muscles bulging, and giving the command to his Cat, the tandem team lay into the Fighter. Mittens lands a devastating swipe of his claws against the Fighter’s chest, and Krug’s flurry of Axe swings finishes the job. \n\nWhile this is going on, Gurk sees his brother in distress and makes the decision that the best way to enter the cart, is to make his own entrance. He promptly charges it, and blows a hole in the wall, sending a shower of broken wood everywhere. The cloaked figure, a Rogue of some kind, leaps back in surprise, throwing a vial of some kind at the newly appeared Orc. It misses completely.\n\nKurg was enjoying his home in the trees. He decided that this was now where he would live, and attempts to jump to the next one. This jump does not go well, and instead Kurg falls to the ground, prone, and on his stomach. Kurg decides the trees are no longer his home, and proceeds to belly crawl over to the cart, standing up as he arrives. He attempts to flip the entire cart over, horses and all, his muscles straining against the load. He manages to lift it off the ground, and but is unable to go much further. He drops it suddenly instead.\n\nInside the caravan, the Rogue and Spellcaster stay standing, the Spellcaster’s eyes glowing along with the chalk circle. Gurk however, is not so lucky, and falls onto his stomach. Frank jumps into the cart once it has settled, and working together (Gurk belly crawling over to the Rogue), they surround the poor dagger wielding man. Gurk rolls over onto his back.\n\nRogue: What are you-\n\nGurk swings his weapon awkwardly over his head, Frank harrying the Rogue and setting him off balance. The swing connects, opening up the man’s chest in a vicious wound.\n\nRogue: OW OW OW! CUT THAT OUT!\n\nThe Rogue goes to stab Gurk in response, but Gurk is (somehow) too nimble and rolls out of the way.\n\nRogue: Ah. Right. Crap.\n\nKurg climbs into the cart at this point, and feels very hungry all of a sudden. He promptly walks over to the Rogue, and viciously bites into his neck. The wound explodes in blood as Kurg tears off the Rogue’s arm with nothing but his teeth.\n\nAt this point Mittens has made his way over to the Spellcaster, the glowing attracting the Warcat like a very hungry moth to a very tasty looking flame. Or something like that. Krug, his chest still containing a sword, and still bleeding profusely, takes his sweet time shuffling over to the Caster, but remains standing despite the blood loss. Gurk and Frank join in, the group of four closing in around the caster, who despite the various smaller upsets and attacks upon her person, remains deep in concentration, unaware of the world around her. Frank has enough of the weird muttering, it hurting his head, and bites down hard on the Caster’s arm.\n\nSpellcaster: OW! What the-\n\nThe glowing stops.\n\nKrug: Friends dead.\n\nSpellcaster: What? Oh. OH! Yes…yes they are.\n\nKrug: Paladin says be nicer. Surrender?\n\nSpellcaster: I…you offer me….surrender?\n\nKrug: Yes.\n\nSpellcaster: Well yes. Yes. I surrender.\n\n???: **CRUNCH**\n\nThe Spellcaster looks over, and Kurg is chewing on her Rogue friend’s arm still, slowing eating it. The Warcat known as Gork is eating a leg.\n\nSpellcaster: YES. YES I SURRENDER. I SURRDNER COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY, WITH NOT RESISTANCE. Oh god please don’t eat me.\n\nKrug goes over to Sanders and shakes him awake.\n\nSanders: Ah, what, how, we’re under attack! Have at thee!\n\nKrug: Dead.\n\nSanders: I- what?\n\nKrug: He dead.\n\nSanders: Oh. Well that’s good.\n\nKrug motions to himself, removing the sword from his chest as he does so.\n\nKrug: Bleeding.\n\nSanders: OH! Yes, I see that. Let me fix that up.\n\nThe Paladin glows somewhat, and performs the signature Lay on Hands. Krug promptly stops bleeding to death.\n\nKrug: We take surrender. We do good.\n\nSanders: You took someone…prisoner?\n\nKrug: Yes.\n\nSanders: Ah. Very good. Which one is it- HOLY CRAP KURG! WHAT HAVE I SAID ABOUT EATING SENTIENT RACES?! PUT THAT DOWN!\n\nKurg drops the arm.\n\nKurg: But hungry. Want to finish eating.\n\nSanders: No. You may not finish eating. And tell Gork to stop that as well. \n\nKurg: But feeding time. Gork feed.\n\nSanders: Well Gork is done feeding. Now.\n\nKurg grumbles in disapproval, but tells his Warcat to stop eating. The Orcs collect various shinnies from their fallen enemies, and Sanders interrogates the captured Spellcaster. She admits to being a Sorcerer hired to sabotage the cart, intending to cause an explosion to slow them down long enough that they wouldn’t make it in time for the Tournament. Being a week away from the nearest Prison, there isn’t much to be done with her. Sanders picks a team from the caravan, one guard and one messenger, to stay with her. The messenger will head to the closest town and procure transportation. The guard will keep watch over the (bound and gagged) Spellcaster.\n\nThe caravan (no worse for the wear) continues on its way, slightly more bumpy than before. Another few days pass, but our misfit band will not reach the Capital without at least one more incident along the way...",

        "text": "I was playing in a high-level SWD20 (around level 15-18) game with a group where I had run the game previously but passed it off for the time being. By this point in the game, the PCs had taken over a pirate moonbase and turned it into a combination black market/Jedi academy during the late Rebellion era.\n\nNow, the party had been harassing the local Imperials pretty substantially for a long time. Finally, since wed grown pretty powerful, the Imperials decided to really do something about them. We caught wind of a task force being assembled to destroy the base. After a few adventures turning Imperial captains away from the task with either morals or money and various other preparations we were as ready as we were going to get for the task force.\n\nThe plan, for the most part, went off flawlessly with help from a pirate ally with a Clone Wars-era star destroyer who helped along with a good number of Rebel support ships. \n\nWe staged ourselves on the pirate destroyer as the two fleets approached each other and prepped three escape pods. When we were ready, positioned dorsal-to-dorsal with the Imperial destroyer we launched the first pod. It was filled with mining droids who landed on the destroyer's hull and started making a hole for the other two. When they were done with that they made their way around and destroyed the shield generators and started working through the gun emplacements.\n\nOnce we were clear we launched the next to pods. One was filled with us, the PCs, and the other with Jedi of various levels. We all landed inside our hole in the hull and got it sealed quickly. Once this was done the Jedi spread around the ship. Our venerable Jedi Master left with another PC who was a higher-level soldier/low-level Jedi guardian ready for his trials. The non-Force-users (like myself) headed to the bridge to take control of it.\n\nAs the Jedi Master and his Padawan approached their position, they are confronted with a a powerful Dark Jedi. The Padawan takes this as his test and the are locked in a room together. There is a large pit in the center of the room so it is almost entirely a catwalk all the way around. \n\nAnd that's when we realize that the Padawan was given a training saber, not a real saber, without telling him when he joined. It was supposed to be a prank. He'd never gotten around to using it because he was so much better with a blaster. Now, in his test, he finally draws it and has to face down a darksider with it, unknowingly.\n\nAs the fight goes on the Padawan is landing strikes left and right but without doing much damage. The darksider can't manage to land anything, though. It's all vitality damage to the darksider with one or two criticals actually doing real damage. After this goes on for around ten or fifteen rounds the darksider is just insulted. He can't hit this punk, but the punk can't miss, but the punk is toying with him with a training saber. \n\nFinally, when he's had enough, the darksider just throws his saber down and walks out saying, \"Screw this! I'm going to the Light Side!\" \n\nAnd then we let the Padawan in on the joke. His response: \"You mean I just noodle-whipped a guy to the Light Side of the Force?\"\n\nMeanwhile, us non-force users are headed up to the bridge. I'm just a soldier/scout type so when we get to the bridge I'm just hanging back to let others work on getting in. With me are a sniper, a medic/techy, and our bombadier. The tech started trying to hotwire the doors while we watched the hallway. After four or five attempts we start getting bored. The sniper says he's tired of this and takes aim with his (rather fancy) sniper rifle at the dead center of the door while the tech makes one last attempt. GM makes them roll initiative to see who goes first despite them basically going simultaneously. Techy wins so he makes a last attempt. Of course he succeeds. The doors open as the sniper pulls the trigger. Roll the shot. Natural 20, confirmed critical. Vice Admiral in charge of the task force was standing dead center of the walkway observing the battle. The blaster bolt hit him dead center of the back of the head. Damage roll basically says his head explodes and he falls over.\n\nThe rest of the bridge fight was a string of explosions and blaster fire as we killed the crew and took control of the ship. \n\nFinally we send the signal to the Jedi to let them know we have control of the bridge. They are all in position. The Jedi Master is the focus point for a massive cooperative Force Illusion. \n\nAll the Imperials left on the Destroyer are led to think that they are the last person left alive on the ship. They all start going crazy as they bump into other people who are not there. They start trying to escape through the docking bay. Someone finally went completely crazy and removed the magnetic airlocks on the docking bay, ejecting the entire crew into space.\n\nThe crew of the destroyer becomes a ring of dead bodies around a Jedi academy/black market.\n\nOne of my greatest sessions ever.",

        "text": "This is an old story from my teenage years, but it encompasses probably my most memorable gaming experiences so I thought someone might enjoy it and with minimal chance perhaps someone here might be one of my old friends or much more likely enemies. By the end of it you will probably not have much respect left for me, but the line between good and evil in the world of law enforcement is not always so simple...\n\nTSRP = The Specialist, an old Half-Life modification and servers with Role Playing plugins and appropriate maps for it, the main one being the city of Mecklenburg where this story takes place. For reference think of Arma/Altis Life which is a much more developed version of the same principles.\n\nI got into this game with my good gaming friend of the time, by then we were both little bastards with histories of running scams in Runescape and being on our IRC channel was cause alone for instant ban from the main clanwar matchmaking channel and the game server administrator union channel, our clan repeatedly banned from Clanbase.  \nSo one day we find ourselves as new found police officers Maxwell Edison (me) and Alan Curtis (him) in the city of Mecklenburg on a TSRP server. I don't remember exactly when the cheating and exploitation started, we were never all that concerned about fair play but very few out there were. Everyone hated police. The main entertainment offered by the game, where server rules banned random killings (or DMing, deathmatching), was robbing stores, robbing people, creating hostage situations and in general creating ways to force out satisfying that trigger finger itch most likely with police at the other end of the cross-hair. Random killings were still ever prevalent as soon as admin turned his back too.  \nIt wasn't an easy life for an officer on foot patrol. Criminals expected to be granted plenty of rights while at the same time they would seek to break everyone else's rights any way as long as they could avoid being banned. If you caught one it was a real pain in the ass to keep them from evading their jail time which often amounted to a few minutes anyways. And what does a kid you manage to lock up do? Whine, whine a goddamn lot. Swear revenge. Call for the admin to ban us. It was probably in great part thanks to their incessant whining that this story became so long. In part because being the little bastards we were we found it amusing and rewarding and in part because the admin couldn't make out the bullshit from the reality any more.\n\nWe were decent players of the game, nowhere near the old ninjas of the deathmatch servers but good enough to provide a considerable challenge to role-players and being who we were we always had handy an undetectable wallhack created by another friend of ours (who in cliche fashion these days has his very own anti-cheat startup company), but later for that...  \nQuickly we started to figure out the game, most enjoying capturing people alive and keeping the jails full. That was our entertainment in game. But the game wasn't just the game, it was also the forums. In the forums there was a constant legal drama of whining about other players (mainly police) and as I had an aptitude for language I did most of the talking and defended us well enough to always keep up the benefit of the doubt on our side much in thanks to those whining in their rage breaking plenty of server rules themselves to render their testimonies suspect.  \nPoor admin had to shift through all that, much like nobility of old he lived in a bubble of being treated differently. He rarely came to the server and as soon as he did everyone put on their masks and acted nice for a while as he strolled the streets and relaxed in his expensive property before giving up and leaving and then everyone immediately got back to business. The admin had a nice property, being the admin of course he could just choose whatever he wanted but nearly everything else in the city was owned by us as we had discovered a flaw in the banking system of the game allowing us to dupe money. This allowed us to for example use the 7/11 backdoor to enter it while it was being robbed, which of course caused a lot of whining and many long forum battles. Eventually we did have to give up some properties as we were being insanely brazen with our wealth but we did get to keep plenty enough.  \nAs you might expect we did a lot of very efficient policing and rose up the ranks, eventually we were allowed to create our very own SWAT team...\n\nWe were our own commanding officers now, there was a Chief of police but he was actually our very own fanboy on the server, we had job giving rights, RP reasons to have heavy weaponry. We went wild. We made an elaborate boot camp procedure that new recruits had to pass, we made tables of different weapon damages in different body parts, penetration through walls and armor, came up with tactics for hostage situations and sieges. We put a 3rd computer to spectate the server (hey, the NSA was just getting into analogous stuff at the same time although we weren't aware of it!). At some point the admin added a drug plugin and a vehicle plugin to the server. The drug plugin was neat mainly because of PCP which gave a 10sec(?) immortality and +100hp, we definitely stacked up on that. The car plugin we absolutely loved because it was the most buggy thing ever, for one if I remember correctly you could spawn your car mid air and just stand on top of the floating car helping with positioning but we also incorporated it into our secret insertion tactics for siege situations as when you spawned a car you would be slightly elevated from the floor to prevent it from being stuck on the floor. This made for a bug where you could spawn and despawn a car repeatedly to slowly rise up in altitude and even go through the roof so we just needed access to a place under the targets and ascend on their unsuspecting asses through their floor. Then there was the speedbug where you could trick the tazing system which lowers your speed to a halt and then increases it after some seconds back to normal to instead increase your speed to much faster than normal.  \nFinally some kind of politics role-play was added and the city came to be under the rule of a military dictatorship and we were re-branded as the Military Police, much to our delight. We arrested and jailed a lot of people, racking up charges so that their sentences would surpass an hour rather than being a few minutes.\n\nThis all culminated on most of the criminal gangs on the server uniting against us and whenever the admin wasn't around the city was a total clusterfuck. All out deathmatching war was declared with every police being kill on sight targets, we entrenched ourselves in the police station, picked up .50 caliber sniper rifles, fired up the wallhacks, jacked up on PCP shooting unending hordes of people pouring down on us. Kill streaks of hundreds were achieved. It was so wrong and so hilarious. Yet nobody was banned, instead eventually the admin gave up and shut down the server.\n\nMoral of the story: don't fight corruption with corruption, it only leads to meaningless massacre :P",

        "text": "The room set out before me is completely submerged in gold.  Coins are littered across the ground in mountains - some Thrones, others unidentifiable - acting like quicksand beneath feet.  The bridge is separated into three tiers, each more decadent than the last.  Giant golden statues, valuable themselves, house priceless artefacts.  Swords taller than trees, shields made to accommodate titans, and armour too beautiful to have been made by the hands of man.  Laid in front of a grand, glorious throne on the top tier is a pit; an opening to the room below.  Every inch is filled with even more vast fortunes, an astonishing amount to see in one place.  Above all the splendour hangs half a dozen chandeliers, gleaming brightly in their own light as their crystals sparkle and shine.\n\nAfter a second of drinking in this wondrous room, I am able to see my Lord and the other seniors - weapons drawn - leading the group of Oathsworn soldiers they have at their command.  On the other side at the top of the bridge they face a sea of skeletal horrors, far more intimidating than the ones chained in the Navigator's tower.  These abominations are not only able to walk, but have been equipped with armour and weaponry.  At the front of the horde a corpse, dressed in what was once expensive garb, steps forward - wielding a blade of his own, powerfist in his off hand.  His jaw waggles, letting out a terrifying screech of laughter.  My Lord and the remains of the legendary Rogue Trader begin to run at each other, engaging in battle, their armies following in their wake.\n\n\"My Lord?\"\n\nI'm brought out of my trance by Clemens.  He is looking at me with slight concern.  I convince him that I'm fine, merely resting my eyes until we get back to the ship.  It looks as if everyone will encounter what I anticipated aboard the Righteous Path after uncovering the Navigator of old.  I suppose I'll have to trust they have the strength to defeat those creatures of darkness.  If the fight like usual, then I can indeed put my fears for their safety to rest.\n\nThey'll be alright.\n\nFor now I need to turn my full attention to my current situation.  I begin making mental preparations for what I'll find once back aboard.\n\nWe dock fairly swiftly as Clemens and I hurry forward.  The halls are strangely quiet with no sign of the crew, coming across the bridge itself completely locked down.  Clemens and I exchange a glance, clearly this wasn't how he left it, when a voice calls over the vox demanding we identify ourselves.\n\nBefore complying, I slowly bring my hand to my ear and call the Barron, checking in on his side.  I am greeted with mostly static, interrupted by gun shots, screaming and cries from the Barron, far too distracted to realise he is being called.  Wherever he is a heated battle is definitely taking place.\n\nAgain I peep at Clemens.  Frustrated, I run my hand over my forehead settling on pinching the bridge of my nose under my glasses.  This has turned into a full blown mutiny, hasn't it?\n\nThe voice over vox repeats itself, asking us to respond.  This time we answer, the doors slowly opening to let us inside.  I straighten myself up, taking a slow, steady breath.  Whatever is happening, I mustn't show weakness in front of the men.\n\nWhen the iron doors are open enough I march inside with Clemens in tow, looking for the security personnel whom the Barron placed in charge.  The crew are charging about haphazardly in a panic; every single one of then turning to me as I come into view, a mixture of hope and gratitude fixed in their expressions.\n\n\"Thank the Emperor, a senior officer!\"\n\nThis doesn't fill me with confidence.  I am approached quickly by the officer in temporary command.  He salutes, immediately launching into the debriefing.\n\nClemens already told me the beginning.  Because of our previous witch hunt the cult, hidden in the underdeck, managed to rally some of the dredge into a mob, adding to their numbers.  Our defences were low, the majority of our security is placed in the upper decks, giving them as easy head start.  It was steadily getting out of hand when the Barron left the bridge with just over half the Oathsworn soldiers, heading down to destroy the cult himself.  Clemens then dispatched with further Oathsworn to tend to our group on the Righteous Path, leaving only a small amount of soldiers left on the upper decks.\n\nSince there was an alarming lack of manpower, the bridge was sealed off to prevent intruders.  However, things started to take a turn for the worse.\n\nThe witches in the underdecks were cunning; they laid traps and used their power to their advantage.  They managed to ambush the Barron and his men, pushing them further into the dark and off our radar.  Currently, they are still lost down there.\n\nSome time after, the cult started to make its way up and across the ship to the higher decks, freeing those we had captured from the brig.  From the camera footage, there appears to be two groups.  One faction is heading straight for our weapons, the Macrocannons, while the smaller group looks to be making its way here to the bridge.  The latter are being held up by Quinlin, apparently not in the underdeck with his pilgrims but in the cargo bay, providing a last line of defence.  His men seem to be standing their ground.\n\nStraight after the officer finishes explaining, the ship starts to rumble.  I know this feeling well enough - our guns were fired.\n\n\"Sir, we're shooting at the Righteous Path!\"\n\nI rush over to the screens, looking on in horror as shells make contact with the already decrepit hull of the ghost ship.  There's only one reason why they would choose to target the treasure trove.\n\nThey're trying to kill our Rogue Trader.\n\n[Start](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3dfr45/tales_from_a_seneschal_rogue_trader/) | [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3kpswp/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_9/) | [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3p846y/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_11/) | [Last](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3xlc9d/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_16/)",

We found amplified rage, which let orcs boost each other’s rage by an addition +4 Sstrength, +4 Constitution while adjacent or flanking the same enemy. For those not familiar: barbarians in Pathfinder rage, and rage hard. They can temporarily have higher strength. With Amplified Rage, X and Y basically go Super Saiyan if they rage beside each other.\n\nAnyways, pretty sure the game will be a grinder or something. Regardless though, as you can see by the stats, they aren’t the smartest….wisest….or prettiest people in the bunch...or the world for that matter. However, they are **Krug and Gurk, the KGB (Krug-Gurk-Brothers)**, mercenaries who are ought to thwart evil and do the right thing! Or so they believe. Always. In reality, gold is what matters, and those who can’t pay, pay in toes. Or fingers. Either or. Sometimes a mix. But they BELIEVE they’re doing the right thing, and that’s what matters. Right?\n\nY: Also I vote our cats just hate us and think we're utterly ridiculous, and try to keep us alive by distracting the enemies.\n\nX: Because we feed them the biggest, most tastiest enemies. I named mine Mittens because of his war claws (they are claws I painted red).\n\nY: I named mine Frank, *after my father*. He's dead now though so it's okay, he won’t get confused anymore.\n\nX: I like that, because probably, Frank was not our father. So when people ask \"Frank was your father?\" I can be like \"No, Frank* is cat. *He name father after cat.*\"\n\nY: exactly\n\n(X: If we don't die, and win by shear stupid luck,I am playing these again someday, one way or another)[After note: Screw that, I **AM** playing Krug and Gurk again, one way or another.]\n\nY: \"Yeah, we name father Franklin, it long for Frank\"\n\nX: \"Gurk not right in head. Franklin still cat. Father was Krugurk. That way he never forget spelling.\"\n\nY: \"Silly that was mother. Father Cat, remember?\"\n\nX: \"....Hmmm. Father was not cat. Mother maybe, but not father. Mother certainly SOUND like cat...\"\n\nY: \"No, she sound like DOG. Very loud dog. For sure at night.\"\n\nX: \"Mmmm. Dog. Tastes good. What talk 'bout?\n\nI know it's not the most original I suppose, but 30 strength at level 1? It's new to me, and the first time I've a character with a single stat below 8, let alone three 5's. Hopefully, lols ensue, play test or not. Note: Our GM has absolutely NO idea what we're doing. He said no restrictions, and I ran the bare minimum past him. I'm hoping this is good.",

        "text": "Previous session here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3mee27/beyond_the_wall_session_8_of_the_battle_of/\n***\nWe find the characters still deeply entrenched in the battle for their village, with Perry and Freya taking the fight to the goblin catapults, and Arrow helping keep the townsfolk safe. Cal and his ‘good friend’ Sun have vanished after an apparent fight at the stables, and that’s where we start things off…\n\nThe Cast of Characters includes:  \nLindsey as *Perdenzia, the Fae Foundling*  \nDJ as *Arrow, the Would-be Knight*  \nCaitlin as *Freya Pendragon Kirkwall, the Forgotten Noble Child*  \nRiley as *Caligeth ‘Cal’ Darwinus, the Apprentice Court Sorcerer*  \n\nWe find Cal and Sun rushing through the woods, trying to flee the insurmountable numbers of goblins that they have uncovered. The creatures seem to be numbering in the hundreds at this point, filtering through the trees carrying torches and blades. Raising his Rod of Storms high, Cal calls upon the magical relic to create a whirling angry storm above the forest, hoping the rainfall will help douse the goblins’ torches and create some chaos. Perhaps not too far away, Perry buries an arrow into the back of another goblin, her and Freya assaulting the next catapult in the line. They had already taken out one, but six more still remained. Freya does her part with some overflowing damage, the blade of her great axe flickering in the torchlight, cutting down two more goblins. Back in the village, the north-western section burns with the harsh flames of the goblin artillery, and the Sage and Tankard has caught aflame as well. Arrow is not paying attention however, rushing to the north of the village to face the goblin war party that Perry and Freya warned him about in a message attached to his falcon.\n\nThe goblins manning catapult #6 drop what they’re doing to attack those that oppose them, swarming the two girls and slashing at their clothes and skin. However, in the mad rush to attack the humans, one such goblin is trampled by the onrushing horde. As they start to back up, Perry makes use of the range to keep her bow nice and ready, felling another and wounding a second. Freya keeps them at bay with her axe, the goblins growing cautious of her steely blade. Arrow finds himself standing alone as a war party of fifteen goblins, one orc, and a strange taller monster approach the village. Knowing he can’t win outnumbered, he calls upon his older brother Bow for help, who also pulls three other hunters to assist. The men are armed with ranged weapons that they use in the hunt. Falling in with the would-be knight, they knock their arrows and open fire, killing one goblin. One arrow goes wild on a crit fail however, striking a lantern and sparking even more fire. One goblin slashes Arrow deeply with his sword, scarring him right across the buttocks in a rather humorous attempt to dodge. Back at the catapults, Freya draws upon the hidden powers of bloodlust and tears a goblin’s arm out of his socket, beating him in the face with it.\n\nIn the woods, Cal and Sun find themselves surrounded, and the young girl is soon victim to a goblin’s blade. In anger, Cal lashes out with his sword, cutting down one goblin as a lightning strike from his sword hits another. The few remaining goblins relent and fall back as the two young lovers stumble back to the village. At the catapults, a strange (nat 1) stroke of luck causes a bear to appear, angered by the recent goblin deforestation and saving the two girls from being overrun. The goblins switch focus to what they determine is the tougher threat. Perry and Freya use this opportunity to disable the other catapults, finally stopping the artillery barrage on Lundenfeld. Perry digs deep into her faerie blood, spinning a special cantrip that gives her the tongue of the forest beasts, reaching out to communicate with the bear. Feeling a kindred helpful spirit in the bear, she rushes to help chase off the goblins with Freya’s help.\n\nBack at the village, the hunters fell three other goblins this time, wounding some others. But the strange humanoid, wrapped in a ratty cloak, extends a hand and casts a powerful magic upon the helpless Arrow, who feels his head begin to buzz. The bugbear tosses back his hood, eyes glowing a radiant blue aura as he delivers a harsh mental command “COME HERE” into Arrow’s head, even though the hopeful knight cannot speak goblin. Dropping his weapon, Arrow watches in horror as his limbs betray him and he moves towards the bugbear, the goblins parting way to allow him to come.\n\nThe bugbear clutches Arrow’s throat, lifting him off the ground. “Where is the stone?” he demands upon the young man, who spits at him and mentions its location in a particularly hard-to-reach location normally used for excreting waste. The bugbear repeats the question for the same result. Frustrated, he throws Arrow to the ground and poses the question one more time. Once more Arrow is flippant, and is kicked for his trouble. He’s on the verge of death now, face beaten and bloodied, ribs broken and bones crushed.\n\n“Is this what you’re looking for?” Shouts Cal confidently, holding the darkstone in the air and shouting in goblin. He had sent Sun back to her home, and hopeful safety, and arrived just in time to see Arrow’s beatdown occur.\n\nThe bugbear’s eyes narrow.",

        "text": "[And we return to the two-man campaign](https://redd.it/3mxmnu) of [Kai the depressive priest](http://fav.me/d91by1o) (with his [personal torment imp](http://imgur.com/ovg2Nz2)) and [Fish the slippery goblin](http://fav.me/d9b2ag0)!\n\nThese two idiots were on an \"adventure\" involving being forcibly ejected from their homes by divine intervention (Read: The DM says you're here now, don't like it, tough shit). They are now stuck in bumfuck nowhere, far away from any place that they previously called home. In short, they are low on supplies, low in level, and stuck in the wild outback where they are likely to be eaten by a Grue. Oh, and the only landmark for miles and miles around was the GIANT SPIRE OF DEATH.\n\nThey were not happy campers. Campers would have been an improvement.\n\nThey eventually happened upon a settlement of Sylphs, who were having some troubles. Namely, that they lived in the goddamned outback near a **GIANT SPIRE OF DEATH**. Idiots. Well, Kai the Priest and his obsessive need to do good kicked in and the two immediately set to helping out around the place. Turns out there was great need for a competent adventurers, as they'd been having monster troubles. For one, all of the wild game in the area were being killed off by a [Hangman Tree](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/plants/hangman-tree). Then there was the issue of the doppelganger, and the town's general lack of capability to do a whole lot of anything. So what do, adventurers?\n\nWell, those little level 1 adventurers were damn well going to kill that CR 7 tree. They had guts, that's for sure!\n\nWell, that makes it sounds worse than it was. They weren't TERMINALLY stupid. Fish in particular was not keen to get ANYWHERE NEAR the damn thing, thank you very much, and was just plotting some clever way of stealing the tree's kills so that the town could eat. It was KAI who came up with the suicide plan. He asked the imp, who was devoted to the Lulz and not much else, for some potent poisons to help him out. To give a bit of extra incentive, Kai said that he would use himself as bait for the murdertree. The imp complied, cackling.\n\nFISH: \"Are you really going to go through with this?\"\n\nKAI: \"Hell no, slap this on some arrows and shoot the tree from a nice safe distance.\"\n\nFor some reason this completely legitimate plan pissed off the imp, and after said imp displayed a FRIGHTENING ability to wreck shit, the party emerged, slightly strangled but alive. With that under their belt, they tackled the issue of the doppelganger!  IT WAS THE ~~BUTLER~~ INKEEPER ALL ALONG!  The doppelganger, of course, pulled the \"It was my twin brother\" argument. After establishing that he meant that it was not the inkeeper's brother, but the doppelganger's, they unfortunately discovered that this was true when one of the townsfolk grew claws and started trying to murder people.\n\nKai grabbed him by the legs and [played The Incredible Hulk to its Loki](http://i.imgur.com/xc32d0g.gifv). Did I mention that Kai is twelve feet tall and has a skeleton made of steel? Kinda important. Well, after they'd reduced doppelganger #2 to a fine gray stain, they decided to get the hell out of there before things got weirder.\n\nThings got weirder. The next town was a beach camp of were-sharks... Yep. Were-sharks. Not noted for being particularly friendly, the shark-dudes refused to give the party the time of day until they'd actually done something of significance for the pack... er, pod? Whatever. THE PARTY HAD TO PROVE THEIR MANLINESS. They decided that the least violent way to do this would be to poke around and see if anything turned up, with Kai asking questions while Fish snuck in the back door (or, flap, they only had tents) to rummage through the unfortunate individual's underwear.\n\nThey discovered that the equivalent of Larry the village idiot was plotting to murder head sharkdude in his sleep. Zing!\n\nUpon delivering this info to Cap'n Sharkpants, he considered it carefully (he couldn't actually read enough to confirm it), and Sharky Larry rushed in to offer hastily put-together explanations. Larry rolled a nat 20 to convince Cap that this was all a misunderstanding. After which he politely asked for the privelage to tear the nosy visitors limb from limb.\n\nThe battle that followed was drawn-out, annoying, and very, very painful for all involved. It was basically a complete shitfest, with everyone dropping their weapons, getting slapped off their feet, and reduced to negative hit points before the battle was over. It didn't help that I'd traded silver-based DR for Ferocity, and Larry had fought well into the negatives before finally giving up the ghost and, pretty important, biting both party members.\n\nSo no shit, there they were, at a total of -7 hp between them, at level two, with no healing spells (homebrew rule), being informed that shark-lycanthropy was permanent after three days and oh yeah the full moon is in a week. And Cap'n Sharky was personally congratulating them on proving to be capable individuals that would be a worthy addition to the shark pack-pod-thing. This was actually alright by Kai, but Fish was having none of it. He already had a fishy name, he didn't want the full package. Unfortunately, they were STILL in bumfuck nowhere, far away from any healers or anyone who might provide an easy \"get out of Lycanthropy free\" card. That left herbal remedies. Which meant adventuring. With a negative hit point total.\n\nTo put it simply, they were preeeeetty screwed. But they had three days, so they could rest up a little before they headed out. They rested one day, meaning that they each had a whole whopping eight hit points when they travelled off to find some wolfsbane. Did I mention that wolfsbane is poisonous? Because it totally is. Oh, and the nearest patch of the stuff is in the territory of a [Dire Badger](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/badger/badger-dire).\n\nFish decided to sneak around the thing, but the the badger smelled him. After that, he got a series of incredibly unlucky rolls to get the hell away from the thing. KAI HELP PLZ! Kai charged in, weilding his big ol' wrench, and smacked the badger right on the butt.\n\nThis pissed it off. And believe me, you have never seen pissed off until you have seen it in a 4-foot-tall badger with enough strength to tear your arms off. It immediately did an about face, lunged at Kai, and hit him for maximum damage, dropping him down to a single hit point.\n\nKAI: \"I have made a tactical error.\"\n\nWhat followed was a bizarre hybrid of a tense chase and a benny hill skit, with Kai hauling ass all over the grasslands while the badger nipped at his heels meaningfully. Thankfully Fish was there to provide covering fire, and he sent several wolfsbane-poisoned arrows hurtling at the badger before giving up and just launching his whole quiver. Kai, almost cornered, wheeled around and smacked the dire badger with his wrench again, on the snout, to assert dominance. With that, the party discovered to their incredible dismay that they had just picked a fight with ANOTHER creature with Ferocity. Fraggin' hell. The badger, bleeding from arrows, wrench wounds, more arrows, poison, arrows again, and a busted skull, still had enough fight left in it to launch one last attack and mangle Kai's ankle. With that, Kai pirouetted, and landed heavily on something crunchy.\n\nAnd that's how Kai killed a badger with his ass.\n\nThe two returned to town, quite the worse for wear, but they had what the needed. Good old wolfsbane! Good old... poisonous... wolfsbane. Thankfully, one of the other members of sharkton was willing to trade with the party for a Potion of Bear's Endurance, so Fish at least had a chance of succeeding. That, combined with Kai's warpriest ability to give him more bonuses and rerolls, meant that he should be fine!\n\nSo of course he rolled three consecutive crit failures, badly poisoning himself and failing to get rid of his lycanthropy at all. Fisheye found it very difficult to keep breathing, but as soon as he regained his composure, he chomped right down on some more wolfsbane. FINALLY, he made some good rolls and succeeded the saves to be both cured of lycanthropy and the wolfsbane stuff. But only by the grace of his Potion of Bear's Endurance.\n\nSo, interesting little house rule, when you only live because of a bonus like that, you've taken enough damage to kill you and you're only alive because of the potion. Which means, congrats, mister Fish! You're a permanent asthmatic unless you keep downing those potions! Fish was not terribly thrilled about this development.\n\nNor about the incoming hurricane. The shark-men quickly packed up their shit and took it underwater, and offered Fish the use of a bunker and more potions if Kai did some technical work for them, building them weapons and stuff. Oh, and the full moon! Kai embraced his were-sharkitude with all the grace it was due, that is, screaming in pain and waking up to find various unsavory things in his mouth.\n\nNext time, the party travels into the underwater world and under the underwater world and under the under-underwater world! And the DM stops being quite so mean to them.",

        "text": "This is the story of my first and current game of Numenera. Having never heard of the system before I had no idea what to expect, but our weekly Saturday games seem to have a sense of wackiness, due in no small part to the oddball nature of the system and its items. Thus far, I've been having fun, and when I offered to type up our experiences on r/Gametales I thought the group seemed wholly behind the idea.\n\nI would say that this was our journey through the 'Hidden Price' (I have been made aware that it's the name of an adventure module, and it appears to be the name of the Roll20 game) but our GM has effectively left us a large, open world to explore. We seem to have gone off any possible beaten path, at least I think we have, so much that I can't tell if we're still on any kind of adventure path at all, so for the most part, I'll throw out **SPOILERS** just to be safe.\n\nOur story begins in a small inconspicuous town by the name of Jutte, and our intrepid group had been informed of a series of fishermen that had gone missing from town. Intrigued, the party moved out towards the nearby lake, either in great hopes of finding some Numenera, being rewarded for the trouble or a severe case of 'fuck it, might as well.'\nOf course, it might also be wise to know who our group were at the start of this all.\n\n*Solaire, a Gaurded Nano who Possesses a Shard of the Sun*, is a on a quest to do good by the people and move out of his mother's shadow. Ever accusing, he feels that the group is up to no good, and follows them around for the sake of stopping them in the act. Bruce appears to be the most trustworthy of the group, especially since Bruce has something that Solaire once had, but lost in a game of chance many years ago.\n\n*H4L, an Artificial Jack who Speaks With Machines*, has no memory of where he was manufactured. What he does know, however, is that he requires Numenera, and a lot of it, hence his accompanying the others on an adventure of sorts. He's best described as a schemer, and was the party's rogue for the most part.\n\n*Vizz, a Mutant Nano who Constantly Evolves*, is wholly convinced that H4L isn't a machine, but is a Mutant, possibly with a shiny carapace. He held a connection to a local merchant that would give him discounts due to good business. Vizz is a bit of an enigma, mostly due to a variety of actions that can't be quantified.\n\n*Bruce, a Strong Glaive who Stands Like A Bastion*, helped Solaire out of a bind at one time in his life. Bruce was a simple man, a gentle giant that couldn't be moved, but could tear things to shreds with his bare hands when prompted to. Having at one time saved a family from a burning building, he was out adventuring due to a lack of funds, ever the helpful optimist.\n\nAnd so it was that our unnamed troupe ventured forth towards adventure, and arrived at Dog Lake with little trouble. The place was undoubtedly quiet, but after some skilful searching we came across another, alternative adaptation to the term 'Head Crab'.\n\nI'm not sure what it is, or what hell it spawned from, but a Mesomeme is a large, durable crab like creature with several tendrils sprouting from its back, on the ends of which the heads of its prior victims are put on grisly display like some crustacean Predator wannabe.\n\nNeedless to say, we found our missing fishermen and a fight began. Vizz and Solaire commenced firing with a series of mind bullets, while Bruce laid into the creature with sword in hand, H4L firing from afar with his crossbow.\n\nA few turns in with little retaliation, we hit the weak point for massive damage and the Mesomeme toppled to the ground. Gathering up what we could, we made our way back to Jutte, collected a reward and completed our tasks. Heroes all, we left Jutte in the hopes of bigger, better things.\n\nA small distance south of Jutte, such bigger, better things had come to us in spades. Before us, on the shore of a river, we encountered this strange black construct, outside of which stood a small gathering of individuals dressed in yellow robes. We watched, warily, as the robed group, with bundles of things (turned out they were pretty much groceries) entered the construct through the use of a shiny, cylindrical device. Moments later, the thing vanished. Within this mess we managed to acquire a book, which contained a variety of notes about the construct, apparently called 'The Narfex', which seemed to teleport around the world randomly. \n\nOur intrigue mounted some level of suspicion, and so, heading back to town, we sought to ask questions, though were quickly pulled aside by a young woman asking us to save her brother from a group of robed people.\n\nJackpot.\n\nShe gave us a key, which was one of the cylindrical devices we've seen used earlier, and some further details on what to expect, and we made our way out. Luckily, we found the Narfex once more, this time many miles North of Jutte, and used the key to gain entrance.\n\nThe Narfex, for those who might not know, is more or less like a Tardis. It is far larger on the inside, with a series of complex corridors and rooms, including living quarters and science labs and what not. It is immense, which probably explained the cult to a degree.\n\nHeading down through the corridors, we eventually find a large communal area, with panels and sofas, and filled to the brim with cultists. H4L starts sweet talking one of the panels on the wall to gain more information, hopefully being able to turn off a function or two and maybe save our asses in the event of automated defences.\n\nAs we waited, Solaire had an idea.\n\nTaking up the key, he used his control over light to make said key glow. It was a desperate gambit, truly unsure if the key was just a device or if it held religious significance in anyway, but with what he knew, he figured it would work. Holding aloft the key, he declared \"Behold! Your chosen one has arrived!\"\n\nThere was a slight pause as the now alert room of cultists (who, I might remind you, likely outnumbered our Tier 1 characters 12 to 1) contemplated our legitimacy, before H4L metaphorically made us go all in by backing up Solaire's claim with his mechanical charms.\n\nSome how, those poor fools bought this schlock.\n\nExcited conversation ran through the room, but before long, one of the cult leaders, Gregor started smelling the significant levels of bullshit on hand and made his own case that we were frauds. Surprisingly, this did not work out for him, and he was forced to bring out his trump card, the 'actual chosen one'.\n\nExiting through a nearby door was Solaire's exact duplicate, minus the enhancements typical of Nanos. Still, Solaire took it in stride, 'explaining' that the doppelgänger was sent by him in some cosmic fashion, apologising to the guy for imposing such grand responsibility onto him.\n\nOnce again, the cultists cheered us on, frustrating Gregor and forcing him to leave to get the Cult Leader. Taking the opportunity, the group told the now loyal cultitsts to leave the Narfex, to live their lives without putting too much stock into this religion thing, and to help people wherever they can. Universal agreement was had, and the room very swiftly emptied.\n\nShortly thereafter, Gregor returned with his leader Abrassal, only to find an empty community room and four armed and dangerous strangers. It was their first, last and key mistake to then view this situation and think \"We can take these guys, no problem. They only out number us two to one and are clearly better equipped.\"\n\nA fight was had, Bruce charging forth with everyone else firing a volley of psychic blasts, solar beams or crossbow bolts and in no time at all the two slightly less gullible cultists were laying dead. Many celebrations were had at this, and with book in hand, we suddenly realised our fiscal gains.\n\nWith only a body count of 2 (minus the Mesomeme) we had now gained effective ownership of a large, capable teleporting fortress, disbanded (probably) a cult and become heroes in our own right.\n\nAnd to think, this was only the beginning. If you'd like to hear more, let me know. We seem to have plenty of shenanigans every week.",

I had most of Oceania and a bit of Eastern Europe and some of Western Europe at the start, friend A had taken the remaining part of Australia and some of Africa, friend B had some of South America,some of Africa and most of Asia (blocking off the route off of Oceania) and friend C had some of South America (I can't remember who had Russia or western Europe).\n\nFor the longest time, friend A and I were fighting for total domination of Oceania, with a large back and ofrth going on. Friend B had chosen to remain neutral in the conflict, only stepping in if someone attacked him, which no one did since he hadn't been fighting anyone while A and C had been at war for the major continents and A and myself were still fighting over Australia.\n\nThat was when I took Australia all for myself, but left my troops spread out incredibly thin.\n\nB chose to remain in his position of neutrality. He had at least a cannon on each and every space he owned. Of course, A chose to ignore this and began attacking B, and with dumb luck managed to take a line through Asia to get to me, reinforcing his troops and conquering Oceania. He was spread thin. Then B's turn came around and, while he didn't make too much of an advance, he took a few of A's countries and wrekced the ones that somehow had remained fortified. C saw what was going on, and he had already been losing earlier in the game. B was doing fine, but had gotten bored.\n\nOf course, when someone gets bored playing risk, but the rest of the players still want to go, how exactly do you leave? Well, his answer was to give all of his remaining countries and armies to me. With one look at the board, the other two sighed and resigned, knowing I could wipe them out in a turn.\n\nI wish I'd thought to post this sooner, would've had more of the details, but it's still entertaining to me.",

        "text": "This is a game of [How to Host a Dungeon](http://planet-thirteen.com/Dungeon.aspx) I just started. I thought I'd try to include you guys into the mix. It's more fun to share.\n\nFor those who know the game, I did the Primordial Age and got two rivers and an earthquake, which gave quite a glorious mess to start with.\n\nThen I chose the Dwarves for the Age of Civilization, which meant creating a vein of gold, which I did. I'm going to do all on one page, so I have not coloured anything in yet or have not made any lines black.\n\nI was thinking about my dwarves and what flavour I wanted to give them. The fake Scottish one is kind of not my thing, so I thought about mountains and then came up with Switzerland. So I hoisted my dwarves in some lederhosen, pulled up some Swiss name lists and started things up. I decided to roll 1d20+1d10 to choose the first letter of the last name/clan name. I rolled an i, and started looking. I saw Ingold, and thought: 'This is perfect, even if linguistically it probably has nothing to do with gold.', and so the Ingold Mining Operation (IMO) was born.\n\nI also decided that one people-token represents seven dwarves, to pay hommage to Dwarf Fortress and of course, Snow White. I decided that some dwarves could have different last names (how else to start families? Please, don't answer!) but only one came up. The brave dwarves that set out for the mining operations are:\n\n* Marco Ingold (Expedition Leader)\n\n* Hans Ingold (Engineer, much needed, you will see)\n\n* Roland Ingold\n\n* Claudia Ingold (The only female of the group!)\n\n* Marco Ingold (Marco seemed to be a popular name, nicknames will be needed)\n\n* Urs Ingold\n\n* Thomas Obrecht\n\n\"We arrived at the location in the Höchstberg mountains without trouble. The creatures here that didn't know not to mess with dwarves soon learned so. Not that there are a lot of serious dangers ahead. There was that one band of nomadic humans that asked for a toll. We gave them a keg of beer. It was a heavy price, but they were with a lot.\n\n\"But now we are here. We started to dig and immediately stumbled on some caves. We ignored them. We are dealing in gold, not in caves. So we pressed on and came to water. Apparently the cave system is largely flooded. Good thing Hans came along. He guided us at how to dig and make some kind of dam or workaround that lets us pass the water. Cleaver guy. Got potential.\n\n\"We needed his help again once we found the gold. It was completely in the water soaked part of this area. It took us some work, but no water filled cave system can beat the Ingolds! Our first mine is dug and our lodging right above the water so that it cannot flood us, but gives us nice and soothing running water sounds to fall asleep in. (Though it does work on the bladder a bit)\n\n\"We decided to name the water, if only for conveniences sake! Simple and clear, we just named it Das Wasser. No need to make things complicated.\n\n\"I will keep you updated once we know more.\"\n\nMarco Ingold, Expedition Leader.\n\n**EDIT:** [Picture Anyway!](http://imgur.com/eGFroq9)",

        "text": "This game took place about three years ago, so I'm a little fuzzy on all of the details.\n\nThis campaign was my introduction to table top gaming. The fraternity I'm in used this as a way to rush some of the freshman, and it worked! So we had started this campaign with about 12 people playing excluding Cody, our DM. \n\nI was playing a Zabrak Soldier, an ex-mercenary who had retired after losing two of his close friends right before the adventure started. There were only two jedi and a handful of everything else but I was playing the only soldier.\n\nWe had done many different things ranging from rescuing a rebel leader from an Imperial Prison on Felucia, to discuss possible treaties from the Hutts, to investigating an old Jedi Temple. It's in this temple that my story happens.\n\nWhen we first arrived at this temple, we were attacked by two force guardians and had to defeat them to move into the temple itself. After our Twi'lek decided to ride one of them like it’s a horse, we mopped them up quickly and moved on. In this temple we came across several different dream sequences where we were almost forced to attack one another, an imaginary force dragon almost eating one of our Wookies with a power hammer, and spending just over an hour OOC arguing whether or not to turn on the lights (not exaggerating here)(left for an hour to go and smoke a cigar and clear my head and came back 45 min later).\n\nWe came across the BBEG and we were all kind of having issues hitting him and some invisible storm troopers, so I decide to finally use my destiny point to hit him for double damage using a heavy blaster rifle (3d12 damage) on burst fire (+2d damage) and I rolled 50 total, so for a total of 100 damage. Everyone just kind of looked at me like I’m a total bad ass for a moment, and then our DM said he used his second destiny point to avoid the shots all together.\n\nI was dumbfounded, especially considering he had already used his destiny point earlier to avoid damage. I was kind of mad but shrugged it off to keep playing. Right after that, we advanced to the next room to face him and a force dragon that seemed to come out of nowhere. So basically my next turn was moving from room one to room two and before I could go again I was shot by an invisible storm trooper and I go down with no health. So I spent the rest of the fight with the BBEG and the entirety of the fight with the force dragon unconscious and hoping to wake up and not making my rolls. \n\nRight after the group finished the fight, the cavern we were in started to crumble and I’m still unconscious, so of the two Wookies decided instead of leaving me, carrying me on his back while everyone was running as fast as they could out of there. Everyone made all of their rolls to make it outside and as soon as they made it out, I finally made the roll to wake up. \n\nI talked to Cody afterwards and he said he had to buff him/give him an extra destiny point because of the sheer size of our group. Plus we were still in the first area of fighting him and if my shot had hit him, he would have died with 90 HP left at that point and we still had to make it to the next room.\n\nEdit: Spacing",

        "text": "It was just another typical day in Stuttgart, lazying around on the couch when Talias Comlink chimed. „Meet me for lunch tomorrow at the Luftwaffels“ was the rather short message from one of her previous clients, an old-fashioned ork leading a decent criminal operation in the general vincinity of Stuttgard. She quickly confirmed that her usual comrades were also invited, checked up on some of her favorite news boards concering the British Nobility and waited for the day to come.\n\nOn the next day, she put on her Vashion Island Steampunk outfit, equipped her Urban Combat and checked up on her car, an old, but well cared for Toyota Elite. All the rage back in the 2050s, now more of a burden than anything else, because it wouldn't interface with modern technology. Still, it was fairly cheap, handled great and was reasonably well armored, all things she desired in a car. Arriving 15 minutes early, she parked in her usual spot and entered the Luftwaffels. It was a curios mixture of bar, dinner and pub and always rather dirty and scrummy. The bartender noticed her entering, gave her a glance and started pouring her usual when she nodded.\n\nHer companions, she wouldn't quite call them friends already sat at their usual table, beers in front of them. Lotor, the human mystic adept in his custom coat, embroidered with magical symbols and pictures originating in norse mythology and Indy, as far as she knew a human mage, in a scruffy hat and casual clothing, already eating away at a plate full of Waffels. She took her seat, smiled at the bartender as he brought over a tankard with beer and looked at the others: „Any idea why we're here today?“ Both shook their heads.\n\n20 minutes later, their client arrived, dressed in a custom tailored suit and with his signature golden cyberdeck strapped to his arm. Archaic of course, but fitting for the aging ork with greying hair. Carefully, he sat down on the last chair, making sure that his trousers didn't crinkle and looked at each of them. „Remember the last run I took you on? That escort mission that you nearly botched because you brought a gun into the meeting room?“ They had already talked about this and since the incident was handled professionally and without any bloodshet, although the opposing side had drawn and fired a gun it had been decided to be a forgiveable lapse. Especially because both sides expected that the other one carried concealed guns. „Your next job ties into that one. The shipment that I bought has been stolen by a competitor of mine. Your job will be to bring me back my shipment and also bring me the one responsible for the robbery. Alive!“ They nodded, negotiated with the Johnson and settled on a price.\n\n After some research, drone-patrols and investigating, they found out that the shipment was stored in a warehouse on the premises of a transport company, owned by the competitor of our Johnson. They decided to break into the compound at night by having our mage levitate us over the fence, then cloaking us with his invisibility-sphere. Any unexpected opposition would be handled by Talia in a non-lethal manner, while Lotor provided Silence-Spells and distractions. Inside, they would locate the freight, load it onto a truck, steal said truck and bring it to our Johnson.\n\nSo far, so good. The first part of the plan went just as planned and they came up to the warehouse loading dock undetected. Unexpectedly, there was still a truck being loaded and just now a worker came around the corner. Talia brought up her assault rifle with gel-rounds, and as soon as Lotor noted she fired a short burst. The shots and scream muffled by the silence spell, the worker dropped to the ground. An ominous red pool began to form around us, Talia cursed and Indy rushed to the downed man. She went inside the warehouse, trying to find the containers and getting them to the truck while Lotor prepared everything for their departure. Meanwhile Indy, the groups pacifist and moral apostel tried to save the life of the downed worker (Seriously, I never roll this good on hits and our GM never rolls this bad on dodge/reduction, apart from this one time...). I nearly get the first container loaded, when a terrifying scream pierces the night. Talia rushes the container into the truck while trying to figure out what happened: Apparently, Indy failed with his healing magics, the worker died and he just lost his shit and screamed in terror at an innocent losing his life (sorry, btw) and Lotor wasn't fast enough with the second Silence spell. Go figure. Pressing the petal to the metal in the pallet loader (so about 10kmh..), Talia loads the second and last container in record time while Lotor throws Indy in the back of the truck. He already managed to get a drivers uniform from somewhere and takes the drivers seat, while Talia and the still incoherently sobbing Indy and hunker down in the rear compartment, next to the shipment and the duct-tapped ex-driver without clothes (yickes). Lotor runs up to the cabine, and slowly navigates the truck to the gate out of the compound where he obviously gets stopped by the guards. He tries to negotiate and con his way out of there, especially because he sees ominous black cars speeding to the warehouse in the distance. As they are getting closer and his options are running thin he slowly starts to panic. When the guard that stopped him announces that his colleague will just quickly check the back of the truck he nearly shots the guy, but manages to keep his cool. Instead, he decides to wait for the other guard to find the surprise and use the hopefully ensuing confusion and surprise to make his escape.\n\nMeanwhile, Talia has pushed Indy to the back of the truck and told him to take care of the driver, just to have him shut up and out of the way. She herself stands right behind the doors, assault rifle with this time lethal ammunition ready and trained on the doors, waiting for the guard to open the door. The enhanced hearing definitely paid for itself today. As the doors start to open, she helps them along with a kick and quickly fires a stun-grenade out of the under-barrel launcher attached to her rifle. When Lotor kicks the truck into gear and floors it, trying to break down the flimsy gate, she nearly falls out of the back of the truck, clinging to the one of the doors as if her life depended on it (which it actually did). Slowly pulling herself back inside, she only notices the black cars pursuing them when bullets start flying past her.",

        "text": "[You know the trouble with being an artist? You can't eat praise.](https://redd.it/3fl6i5)\n\nThis was the argument going through the head of Omi, an aspiring painter just out of college. She had been ready to face the world. The world hadn't given a shit. She needed something real, something tangible. She needed to get a sponsor.\n\nSo she hit up Sin Records.\n\nAfter some \"bargaining\", a paper with way too much fine print and a worrying number of signatures, the odd blood sample, identity \"check\", and other assorted \"completely legal procedures\", Omi had a job as an artist on retainer. All that was left was meeting her new manager! She called the man and set up a meeting in the local bakery, where he would be buying lunch. There was just one problem...\n\nOmi met her new manager with a cheery greeting and genuine enthusiasm. It was just unfortunate that her manager was [MedStudent](http://i.imgur.com/x3o2fZG.jpg), the fucking sociopath whose previous offenses against dignity included attacking his friends with hypodermic needles, confessing to murder in front of complete strangers, home invasion, a bit of arson (although that was actually helpful), unlicensed surgery, unintentionally murdering hobos, and accidentally detonating a bomb in a friend's skull (he got better). He was on his best behavior today, so excited for his new responsibilities that he decided to take about three dozen not-quite-feral animals into the bakery with him. When the owner of said bakery came to object to his shop being turned into a goddamned menagerie, Medstudent responded by grabbing a nearby pigeon and slitting its throat.\n\n...\n\n[THIS WAS OMI'S NEW BOSS.](http://i.imgur.com/BCM1FUX.png)\n\nAs Medstudent made a hasty retreat, pursued by the bakery owner, animal control, the health inspectors, the police, and a pack of rabid cats. Omi sat for a while contemplating her new existence, when she was accosted by someone a little more down-to-earth: the reliable [Denial](http://i.imgur.com/1aw8O5g.jpg), who was listening in on things out of curiosity. Denial sadly informed Omi that this was, generally speaking, par for the course, and expressed his deepest sympathies for the struggling artist.\n\nWHICH IS WHEN [BULLMIME, ***AVANT GARDE ARTIST EXTRAORDINAIRE***](http://i.imgur.com/GPR6sZx.png), CRASHED THIS PARTY TO TAKE DENIAL AND HIS NEW FRIEND ON AN ADVENTURE! WHY ARE YOU CRYING, COME ON WE'LL SHOW YOU SOME COOL STUFF. With that, they piled into Medstudent's 'car', [AKA a cardboard box with mysterious stains, and went on an adventure](http://i.imgur.com/7pTWDLf.png)!\n\nThe highlight reel: [Talking gangster gerbils](http://i.imgur.com/iBXkNgl.png), [werewolf delivery gal](http://i.imgur.com/uTafvow.png), [crazy underground landlady who may or may not secretly be a voodoo witch doctor](http://i.imgur.com/4Pax9qT.jpg), [vampire clinic workers](http://i.imgur.com/U0vuGLH.png), [the wolfsquidborg luchadore](http://i.imgur.com/BJdZJIG.png), and [an utterly baffling account of absolutely goddamned everything that Bullmime had ever done with her \"buddies\"](http://i.imgur.com/xEiXXmT.png).\n\nThey wound up wandering about in The Underground, a massive subterranean city that Omi had previously not known of. While Bullmime was still expounding on all the wonderful things she and all of her friends had gotten up to (with the secret goal of driving the poor Omi off the deep end in the space of a day, as \"performance art\"), the party head an ominous revving noise. For you see, the party had stumbled upon the lair of the dreaded [1979 FORD FAIRLANE, the murderous were-car with an insatiable appetite for blood!](http://i.imgur.com/eQ4cAho.png)\n\nBullmime valiantly threw herself upon this problem with great gusto, having long ago taken a perk that makes her IMMUNE TO CARS (no, seriously). Omi and Medstudent, meanwhile, were scrambling for some way to either A: get the hell out of here or B: wreck the murdercar. While Bullmime ran around screaming \"TORO, TORO!\", Medstudent came up with the brilliant idea of leaping onto the speeding car and forcibly turning off the engine. This was the closest thing he'd yet had to a good idea, but it took him about three blocks' worth of pavement, shredded clothing and road rash in order to accomplish. He drew himself in and set about smashing things up, but forgot to wear his seatbelt and was violently ejected from the windshield (meaning more medical bills, yay!) Omi, meanwhile, improvised some weapons and manage to pierce the thing's tires, and Bullmime was ultimately disappointed both that elbow-drops weren't working and that the murdercar was now retreating.\n\nBut, luckily, Bullmime's OTHER mission (that of driving Omi insane) was right on track, as she quickly devolved into that most familiar of mental states- total breakdown. GOOD JOB, GUYS! Bullmime then took pity on the poor woman and carefully escorted her home.\n\n--\n\nBUT WAIT, THE STORY DOESN'T END JUST YET!\n\nSeveral months later, Omi was adjusting reasonably well to the new \"normal\". She and some friends (Lupusexpress the delivery wolf, Denial the ordinary person, and for some reason Medstudent) were having a nice little meal at the local ninja burger. Which is when the [shady white-stealth-suited government operative](http://i.imgur.com/GgjfQyN.png) showed up. He and his synthesized voice were there to offer the little group some 'actual honest work' that was 'their fault anyway', to which Medstudent responded by drawing a pocketknife and attacking the shady individual.\n\nLet me reiterate. A heavily armed government ninja pops in beside you from seeming invisibility, offers you a job, and the correct response is ASSAULT WITH A POCKETKNIFE.\n\nOne shameful smackdown later, the ninja burger was completely wrecked, Medstudent was sporting some new and fascinating injuries, and the party was taking the job. So they quickly set off (in Denial's ordinary car and Lupusexpress's delivery van, respectively) to go and see what the biz was.\n\nThe \"biz\" was apparently a status quo violation of epic proportions. An entire neighborhood had just gotten wind of the existence of WEIRD SHIT, including... well, everything that had previously made Omi into a crying wreck. It's just that when you cross that with mob mentality, you get pitchforks. The entire area was cordoned off by more shady government agents, and the party was aimed in the general direction of the angry mobs and told to \"Sort it out, broheim\". Thus, the party set off on the mission of diplomacy!\n\nThere was a lot of talking to be done among the scared and infuriated populace, and the party responded with various tactics. Some tried reason (Lupusexpress), others tried running away and accomplishing nothing (Medstudent), still others tried empathy (Omi had been through this routine), some tried misdirection and reassurance (Denial insisted he was a reporter, which was true, and that he could bring the mob's concerns to the city government, which was true but completely pointless), and a few just tried bargaining with drugs, money, and other incentives (EVERYONE). Surprisingly, the team was pretty good at convincing people to either accept the new normal or not murder people because they were upset.\n\nWhen the government ninja popped in to congratulate the party on their good work, Medstudent got argumentative, and the ninja responded with open hostility, annoyance, and outright threats. So Medstudent pulled a gun.\n\nFor some reason this did not go over well.\n\nFive minutes later, Medstudent was awakening from a brief zap-induced coma that had nearly killed him. The government ninja was nowhere to be seen, but had left Medstudent a present: that of a quarantine chip in his skull, confining him permanently to the underground. Which was a bit odd considering the party was on the surface at the time, but whatever. Medstudent would not stand for this, though, and quickly decided to do something about it.\n\nWhich was, TAKE HIS POCKETKNIFE AND TRY TO REMOVE IT.\n\nREMOVE THE TAMPER-PROOF BOMB PLANTED BY THE GOVERNMENT AGENT, WHO WAS NEARBY. WITH A POCKETKNIFE.\n\nThis was a procedure that Medstudent had tried before, by the way! He tried to remove one of his squid luchadore's quarantine chips (he had quite a few), and had failed the roll so severely that the only reason either of them were alive was because the chip was defective. THIS chip was in perfect working order, armed, and not to belabor the point, EMBEDDED IN THE SKULL OF MEDSTUDENT, WHO WAS THE ONE PERFORMING THE OPERATION, WITH A POCKETKNIFE.\n\nMedstudent went through with it anyway, and with a final blast of stupidity, his fucking head detonated and his skull was distributed across four party members, three buildings and two and a half city blocks. [Truly An Hero who will be remembered forevermore, RIP in peace](http://i.imgur.com/UtMrbNA.jpg). The government agent found this fucking hilarious and burst out laughing, along with most of the party. The only downside to the situation was that Denial, who had serious problems with blood after some previous experiences, and had crit failed his roll to keep his cool. He was well into Freaking Out, Man territory and [would probably never be the same again](http://i.imgur.com/54IS8Hf.jpg). Thankfully, the rest of the party still had their wits about, and promptly disposed of Medstudent's headless corpse by feeding it to some nearby gangster gerbils. With that, the party wrapped up the remaining angry mobs with no real problems at all, dusted their hands, concluded that it had been a productive day all around, and left the neighborhood in good spirits.\n\nThat particular neighborhood promptly vanished into a mysterious sinkhole and was then integrated into the vast city of The Underground, but that probably wasn't significant or worth investigating.",

It hit me a few weeks back and I immediately got all my friends into a call.\n\n\"Hey, you guys wanna kill Nazis as super powered freaks of nature?\"\n\nEveryone- \"Fuck yeah\"\n\n**RAF East Church Kent, England Fall 1942**\n\nPrivate Scratch was waiting for his first deployment. It had been a long time coming, eight months learning about his new-found abilities with the Free Council, only to be drafted into a couple months of basic training, followed by several more learning German, code breaking, and infiltration tactics. He had just received his mission earlier that day, an infiltration of a base in Nazi occupied France and stealing a code book, and was waiting for the ride that would take him there. Apparently though, the take off was delayed due to problems with the radio equipment. Scratch took out his headphones, connected the wires into his flashlight (he had fussed the functions of an old radio into his flashlight for easier transportation) and flipped through the stations. There was an odd noise overlaying the broadcast, a noise unlike anything he had heard before, like a low rumble mixed with white noise. Scratch asked where the radio equipment was and was directed to a small shack on the other side of the base.\n\nThe sight he found nearly broke his heart. The equipment was in a woefully shoddy state, wires were frayed, knobs had fallen off, the whole shack was dusty, and a left over sandwich was lying on the floor. Scratch sighed, he had only recently been transferred here but he already wanted the quartermaster to lose his job. He looked over the equipment, only basic repairs were needed, the kind of stuff he was doing years before he picked up his magic tricks. A few minutes later, the radio was back in order and Scratch did one more scan, no weird noise this time, good. He informed his superiors that the radio was fixed then tuned to his favorite station and listened to music and patriotic propaganda until it was time to fly out.\n\n**2200 hours, above Saint-Quentin France**\n\nIt was a foggy night, which made it easier to avoid the flak and other planes. The pilot turned back to Scratch and said, \"Alright, get out of my plane\". \"I noticed we aren't slowing down and are still well above the ground\" Scratch commented. \"Indeed, now get out of my plane\" the pilot replied. Scratch double checked the bag he had been given, sure enough, there was a parachute inside. Lovely. Scratch stood at the ledge, contemplated the events that led to this downright horrifying situation, then leaped into the cool, dark night.\n\nScratch touched down in a field by a road. He quickly ducked into a nearby wooded area and took inventory. Inside his bag was a knife, four days of food and water, his headphones and flashlight, a map of the area, binoculars and a watch. The limited rations didn't bother him as he could always make more, what did bother him was the lack of money. Really? They gave him a watch but forgot to supply a few pounds or francs or german dollars or whatever the hell they used? Whatever. Scratch turned his parachute into a lovely quilt then set off towards the town towards the north-west.\n\nHeading down the road, Scratch started to hear patrols further out. He wasn't too worried until he remembered that there was a curfew in place and ducked behind the shrubs by the road, waiting for them to pass.  This happened a few more times throughout the night, at one point, Scratch was stuck waiting for a few soldiers to finish a game of cards and turn their attention elsewhere. This led to him waiting for hours until most of them were asleep before creating a sound bubble around himself and crawling through the shrubs past them. After the three hour waiting game, Scratch was fairly tired. He collapsed behind a tree, pulled his quilt over himself, and slept.\n\nScratch awoke sometime in the afternoon the next day. While chewing on his spam and crackers, he tuned into the local broadcasts. Some classical music, Nazi propaganda, a speech about some new tech coming into town, and an coded german broadcast that he couldn't figure out despite his best efforts. Then he found another station, an coded french broadcast had a very weak code that Scratch couldn't figure out solely because he couldn't speak french. Just as he was about to turn it off, the broadcast started freaking out and all that could be heard was a weird noise, the same rumbley, white noisy sound that he heard back on base. Then the broadcast just cut out, nothing but static. Weird. Scratch pondered this turn of events before packing up and headed for Saint-Quentin along the road now that curfew wasn't an issue.\n\nSaint-Quentin was a fairly quiet city. People walking around didn't really talk to each other as Nazi troops patrolled the streets. Some buildings were in complete ruins but no one came near them. Scratch casually walked towards the river to the south-west. He was told during briefing that there was a contact who would be feeding the birds by the lake that would help him out. He was also told that other members from Spooky Squad would come to the same contact to assist him in his mission but that was at a later time. Walking down the river bank, Scratch spotted a man that met the description and approached. \"The birds are quite lovely\" Scratch said in german while coming closer. The man grunted in approval while tossing another handful of crumbs to the birds.\n\n\"Shame about them being hunted and all that, *are the wolves still searching* for them?\"\n\nThe man looked up, noticing the code words. \"The wolves are still hunting today, but the birds will be back tomorrow.\" The man stood up and started walking back into town. Scratch decided that he had done well for today and went to find a place to stay for the night. Of course, since his higher-ups apparently forgot to lend him a fiver, he had to trade his watch for a meal and a room for the night at a local tavern. Scratch flipped through the station one last time while chewing on his meal before turning in for the night. Tomorrow was going to be another glorious day smack dab in the middle of enemy territory where the slightest wrong move would earn him some of the world's finest lead directly to the face. Fun times.",

        "text": "Characters:\n\n  * Edmond (author); trenchcoat and a knife given to me later because I didn't have the foresight to include one\n  * Andrew; some martial arts I don't recall and a knife of some sort\n  * DJ; some other martial arts (Krav Maga was in there, I think) and a javelin/staff hybrid that I forget the name of\n  * Joshua; Geometry Dash and mad driving skillz\n  \nLegend:\n\n  * Anything in brackets is out-of universe, explaining what we rolled or conversation outside of the game.\n\nThe plague was unexpected. It wiped out any adult exposed in a few minutes. We played it safe&amp;mdash;waited it out in a small house in central Texas. We'd no idea what was going on outside our stealthy, isolated world. We'd heard things, sure&amp;mdash;when most of the population's gone, it gets quiet. But we simply hadn't enough data to draw any conclusions as to what had happened. What we did know, however, is that the two adults among us had collapsed in a seizure of some form, then... well, stopped breathing.\n\nTwo weeks after the outbreak, we crawled from our hidey-hole. Much was the same, save the buzz of the city. Usually, Austin's traffic is hell&amp;mdash;but without the majority of the population, there was nothing. We made a half-hearted attempt to break into a Prius on our street, but were met with an alarm that nearly deafened us. We frantically ripped apart every electrical contact we could find&amp;mdash;all to no avail. After fleeing the scene, we noticed a house with an ancient Jeep parked in front of it, likely a bit easier to hijack than a Prius.\n\nAndrew, DJ, and I managed to break into the house to look for the Jeep's keys. Upon arriving in the living room, we were greeted with the sight (and smell) of a two week-old corpse in an armchair. [We rolled (triple D6, I think; I'm new to this) to find how much we would vomit at the smell. I rolled an eight; as such,] I didn't bat an eye. Andrew and DJ weren't so lucky. [They'd rolled 15 and 18, so] They couldn't stop vomiting. [In person, this was a lot more hilarious, as they were doing a fantastic job of acting it out.] After a bit of searching, we eventually found the keys to the car.\n\nAs an added bonus, the Jeep had kayaks attached to the back. In a last-ditch escape plan, we could always take to the lake. We got in the car and drove through the city, meeting altogether too many thirteen-year-olds who watched too many Mad Max movies. The plan was to go to the [Home Depot](https://www.google.com/maps/@30.4837945,-97.6742184,3a,23.4y,38.21h,88.25t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s1K6uZhIyRS2ktEpLF_jC7Q!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1) (for melee weapons) next to IH-35.  We found that the entrance was fortified and there was blood all over the ground. We drove across the street to a similarly fortified [Lowe's](https://www.google.com/maps/@30.4850088,-97.6776953,3a,75y,38.02h,91.18t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sFWTZ4Z_-pGRDxV1lOWDX8Q!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1). Upon realizing that this was, in fact, the Lowe's I was thinking of, I suggested that we enter [TechShop](https://www.google.com/maps/place/TechShop+Austin-Round+Rock/@30.4848796,-97.6788022,3a,75y,37.13h,86.27t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1suVYn1w3_Jwjy6d7WKPtqxQ!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo2.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DuVYn1w3_Jwjy6d7WKPtqxQ%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D160.44571%26pitch%3D0!7i13312!8i6656!4m2!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0x266594c9fbfb68b9!6m1!1e1), as it not only has a secondary entrance to Lowe's, but also has machining tools&amp;mdash;very useful for making melee weapons.\n\nJoshua, our driver, stayed in the car. He'd been keeping up a single game of Flappy Bird the whole time&amp;mdash;who were we to interrupt? Andrew, DJ, and I ventured into the building. [At this time, the story focused on Andrew and DJ and I was left in the dust. Thus, it was later decided that] I stayed stealthily in the antechamber. [The sign-in desk area, that is. Street View has images from inside; take a look. At this point, Andrew and DJ are having quite the adventure in the building. I don't remember it all, so I don't think I'm qualified to narrativize it. As such, I'll summarize: they found a kid, knocked him down, were confronted by his buddies (with TechShop-manufactured melee weapons), crushed the kid's skull, pissed off his buddies, and both died painfully inside as a result.] Upon hearing screams from inside, Joshua looked up from his game of Flappy Bird, swore under his breath, and started the engine.\n\nOne of the people inside the building had the prudence to check for other enemies. He walked outside, not noticing me cowering in the antechamber, and promptly saw Joshua&amp;mdash;*still* playing the same game of Flappy Bird&amp;mdash;in the Jeep. He whipped out a nine millimeter pistol and pointed it at Joshua, commanding him to get out of the car. Joshua complied, stepping slowly out of the Jeep. After somehow managing to [roll a critical success (3) and] dodge a bullet, he attempted to grab the gun&amp;mdash;only to be shot in the shoulder. He collapsed, with the enemy standing behind him turning to face him. At this point, I charged out of the antechamber, drew my knife, and dived for the attacker. I missed by quite a ways, landing in a heap behind the enemy, but distracting him nonetheless.\n\n[Mind you, Joshua is still playing Geometry Dash. The game master (there weren't any dungeons, OK?) asked him what he wanted to do to the attacker. \"Hit him in the shins? Punch him in the gut?\" Joshua, in a completely unexpected twist, promptly replied, \"I elbow him in the balls.\"] Joshua then, in a moment of madness (or brilliance; hard to tell) shoved his elbow into the most fun place possible for the attacker as hard as he could. The attacker doubled over in pain, crying out. This was my chance. I lunged for the enemy's back with all of my weight [and rolled a 5, IIRC] and sunk the knife in deep. We stayed there for a moment, panting.\n\nI heard an arythmic tapping. Joshua, amidst pain, loss, and trenchoated heroics had kept the same game of Flappy Bird going. *After being shot in the shoulder.*\n\nNow *that's* dedication.\n\nAddendum:\n\nThis was my first RPG, and, accordingly, my first /r/gametales submission. We're planning on getting together again and doing something similar with a few more people, so expect more stories. If you didn't chuckle, tell me why and I'll make it better. \n\nEDIT: Apologies for the lack of the game's name in the title. It wasn't really an official game, so... well, you get the idea.\n\nEDIT 2: DJ reminded me what happened in the building. I'll add it one of these days.",

        "text": "My D&amp;D buddies and I have been talking about writing stories based on our (mostly) original D&amp;D world for a while now, the game ended a few months back and we decided to start writing. I wrote a rough draft over the course of about three weeks for the beginning of our story . Here's what came out. Strap in, it's gonna be a long ride.\n\n\n\nOscar and the Necromancer\n\n\tOscar was a particularly peculiar individual. Oscar wasn’t born like most of the people in his home village were, at least not that anyone knew. Oscar just appeared one day. He wasn’t human, or at least he wasn’t any sort of human that was recognized in this realm. He stood on two legs, walked like a human, and he spoke the common tongue, but his body was covered in hair, face and all. His whiskers and short nose gave him an appearance similar to that of a cat. His hands and feet were clawed, and his eyes were a piercing green.\nWhen he first appeared in the tiny village of Arrow’s Peak, named for its distinct triangular shape, Oscar was nothing more than a baby. He was found inside the house of Marcus, the leader of the faction of mercenaries that sometimes took work in the nearby city of Shingen. Marcus took it upon himself to raise the child as a son, though he had not the knowledge nor the means to raise a child. Oscar grew up among warriors, trained alongside fighters and assassins. The faction took him in as family as he learned their arts and ways. By the time Oscar reached adulthood, he was an able warrior, rivaled in skill only by Marcus himself.  \nArrow’s Peak was a small village, mostly consisting of small wooden buildings. A small well sat in the center of it. It was surrounded by green, grassy land. A simple dirt road passing through the center of the village was the only real street, there were no brick or paved roads. The city looked rather dull from the outside.\nOn this particular day, Arrow’s Peak was much brighter and louder than usual. This was due to nearly the entirety of the village being covered in flames. The buildings were burning, people were running through the street, screams were everywhere. There were other things too, running through the blaze, chasing the residents of the village and catching some of them. They had gray skin, wiry hair, gaunt features, with bones clearly visible through the skin. Many of them looked partially decomposed. They shrieked, filling the air with their blood-curdling noise. These things were people too, or at least used to be. They weren’t living, at least not in the normal sense of the word. They ran through the flames, some even catching fire, without so much as a wince or a moment of hesitation, they felt no pain, they felt no remorse. The faction members were doing the best that they could to defend the town, but it was no use. The creatures were ferocious. They sprinted on all fours, leaping and clawing at anything or anyone they could find. What remained of the faction gathered together in the center of the village, buildings completely ablaze around them. Oscar was with them. Marcus and three others were the only ones left. They stood back-to-back in a circle with weapons drawn. The creatures ran towards them, with ferocity in their glowing eyes. They leaped and fell, slashed by sword and axe. A seemingly endless wave advanced, bodies falling on top of one another around the circle of warriors. Oscar slashed and hacked at them, killing creature after creature. They continued, until one of the mercenaries could no longer fight them off and was overrun. No time was left to mourn before more of them appeared. Oscar’s strength was beginning to fail him, the endless waves were tiring him quickly, each slash was slower than the last, each carrying less force. The creatures’ speed and strength never faltered, each one running and attacking and dying as more climbed over its body. Another warrior fell. Oscar, Marcus, and another stood in a tight circle, watching as the village burned around them, slashing over and over. Suddenly, they stopped, The creatures stopped attacking. They simply stood and watched, they stared as the three warriors breathed heavily and clutched their weapons close to them. \nA cloaked figure was standing at the edge of the dying flames, on the dirt road that passed through the smoking village. Oscar's fur began to stand on end. This figure made him feel very uneasy. It stood with its face covered by a hood, holding its hand outward. A purple glow was emanating from its hand, the same glow that was seen in the eyes of the creatures that had attacked their village. The hooded being was dressed in black, its robe covered in symbols that Oscar didn't recognize. There was a crescent shape with a star upon his chest, the symbol of Lum, the god of the moon. It lowered its hand and the purple glow faded away. The eyes of the creatures faded as well, as they collapsed to the ground in heaps.\n\"This doesn't look good,\" Marcus said. He sheathed his sword and pulled the longbow from his back, notching an arrow onto the string. The figure began to move toward them, seeming to almost glide across the ground. Marcus pulled the arrow back, aimed the bow, and released. The arrow sailed true, flying toward the hooded figure at lightning speed, but stopped before it reached them. The cloaked figure had raised its hand up, and the arrow stopped inches from its face. The arrow, now shrouded in a deep purple mist, turned around. The sorcerer closed his fist and the arrow came sailing back, lodging itself into the throat of the remaining faction member. He fell to the ground, grasping at the arrow shaft and making a terrible choking sound. \n\"Oscar, run,\" said Marcus. \n\"I'm not going to leave you here,\" Oscar responded. \n\"Oscar, he's too powerful. You cannot defeat him. I cannot defeat him.\" \nThe figure grew ever nearer, still gliding across the ground.\n\"Then come with me. Why can't you run too?\"\n\"If we run, we die. I may be able to delay him and give you time to escape.\"\nOscar was bewildered by the thought. \"I'm not just going to leave you to die.\"\n\"You must, Oscar, it is the only way that you can live. Go!\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Oscar, this is my final gift to you. I'm giving you a chance to get away. There's no way for me to make it out of here. Now go, my son.\"\nOscar realized that he was right. The figure was close now, and Marcus pulled back another arrow on his bow. \nOscar turned his back and began to run. He didn't want to look, too afraid of what he might see. He heard the bow fire again, and again he knew the arrow failed to hit its target. He heard a clank as the arrow broke through Marcus' mail shirt. He heard a sword being drawn. He kept running. Oscar turned his head, just for a moment. There in the ashes of the shouldering village, he saw the figure holding Marcus aloft, being restrained by a purple ring of smoke. Marcus' sword lay on the ground. The arrow was buried into his chest. The sorcerer held its right hand off to the side as a curved blade materialized out of the air. It took hold of it and raised it, preparing to swing at Marcus. Oscar turned back. He sprinted off toward Shingen. He didn't look back again. He couldn't look back again, but he didn't need to. He already knew what he would see.\n\nShingen was a shining port city. It was constructed as tribute to Solace, the incarnation of the sun. In the daylight, the city shined a brilliant gold, and in the night, lanterns lined the streets, illuminating the city and creating an aura of light around it. The city was a haven for any that came seeking shelter or safety. The brilliant, tall, stone buildings reached high above any that Oscar had seen in his home village. On a hill near the center of the city stood a magnificent castle. The castle's spires towered over the city itself, and the castle walls were encrusted with golden figures in a variety of scenes, telling the city's history. \nIn truth, Oscar disliked Shingen. He was raised in a simple place and developed simple tastes. He felt that the whole city was just too extravagant. If Oscar ever needed to spend multiple days in the city, he would almost always chose to sleep in a small camp outside the city in the adjacent wooded area. \nBy the time that Oscar had reached Shingen, the sun was beginning to disappear beyond the horizon, and people were beginning to light lanterns in the street. Oscar had been running for several hours and was extremely worn out. He entered the city, choosing a nearby tavern to stop, rest, and go back over the events of the day in his mind. \nThe Rusty Flagon was a loud, crowded place. Oscar knew it well. The smell of ale and desperation filled the air as Oscar walked in. He took a seat at the bar. The man working it on this night was named Braun. The name was accurate to say the least, the man was a giant beast made of pure muscle. There were hardly any disputes in the tavern on nights when Braun was working, he had a way of resolving them that not many people enjoyed. \n“Can I get you something?” Braun asked.\n“Not right now. I just need to think.” Oscar replied. He didn’t have the coin to purchase a drink anyway.\n“Have it your own way,” said Braun.\nOscar ran back over the events that had occurred. Thought about the sorcerer, the necromancer that had attacked his village. He thought about the symbols. The only one he really knew was Lum’s. There had always been a feud between followers of Lum and those of Solace, but never to this point. There had been fights and even killings in the name of each group’s respective deity, but never had an entire settlement been destroyed. Oscar needed a plan. He needed to defeat the necromancer that had destroyed his village, the one that had killed Marcus. He needed to do it quickly too. The necromancer had destroyed Arrow’s Peak in minutes, who knew how much more damage he could do? The main problem that Oscar faced was that the being had magic and could wield it skillfully; Oscar’s blades were useless to that in a fair fight. He would need to use stealth to sneak up on the necromancer unaware. Perhaps he could receive help from inside the city. He may be able to ask king Fernando for help, he lived in Shingen, but Oscar had no idea how to reach him.\nIt was getting late, and Oscar had had a very long, very tiring day. He decided to head out and set up a camp in the woods. Oscar left the tavern behind him, exiting the city and hiking about a half-mile into the woods. He built a small fire and set up his bedroll in a nearby tree, suspending himself from the branches with a series of elaborate knots. Oscar had not had any rations with him when he left Arrow’s Peak, and lacked the coin to purchase any in town. His stomach grumbled but he tried to ignore it. Oscar smothered the fire, then climbed into his makeshift hammock and laid awake for several hours, haunted by visions of the day's events. The necromancer, those creatures, the flames. He thought of his friends, his neighbors, his family, all dead. Oscar tossed and turned, rustling the branches of the tree. It seemed like an endless night. Oscar wasn’t sure when he fell asleep, but it was far from a peaceful night for the young warrior. \nThe following morning, Oscar awoke with a start, light shining through the leaves and branches of the tree. There was someone in his camp. He’d let down his guard for too long, slept too heavily. Now there was someone in his camp and he was vulnerable. He could hear them, sense them moving around below him. The bed he’d crafted for himself was not easy to get out of silently, he would have to be ready for a fight. His sword was at the base of the tree with his satchel. all he had were his katars, blades that wrapped around his fingers and extended from his knuckles. He silently readied them, moving as little as possible so as not to rustle the branches on the tree. He took a deep breath, then rapidly leaped from his bed and landing on the ground below. He spotted the invader immediately, standing by the trunk of the tree. It wasn’t the necromancer. It was a man, just over six and a half feet tall. He was lightly armored, wearing a leather tunic and trousers. He had weapons too, a longbow strung across his back, and two scimitars, long curved blades, resting at his sides. The man heard Oscar’s feet hit the ground and turned toward him. Oscar looked at the man’s face. He was human, but only partially; he appeared to be half orc. He had light gray skin, and his face had very strong features, with a set of teeth showing just over his upper lip. Oscar raised his daggers to attack. The man saw this, seemed startled by it, but unsheathed one of his scimitars in response. He tried to say something but was interrupted by Oscar lunging at him, daggers swinging and cutting through the air. The half-orc raised his sword in response, blocking the blows. He unsheathed his other sword and prepared to deflect another flurry.\n“Wait,” the half-orc exclaimed as Oscar pushed forward again, blades arcing around, hurtling towards him. He once again expertly intersected the daggers’ flight paths with his own blades. The clang of steel against steel rang out in the open woods as the blades slid along one another.\n“Stop, I just came to talk!” The half-orc said. Oscar heard the man, but disregarded his words. He was angry. He was angry at himself for letting down his guard, he was angry at the necromancer for killing his father and all those close to him, he was angry at this half-orc for invading his camp. He wasn’t going to stop until he had calmed himself. \nOscar let out a yell and swung over and over again, advancing with every blow, but no swing could hit its mark. The half-orc sidestepped and dodged and deflected, making Oscar’s rage induced assault entirely worthless. The invader never attacked Oscar, simply letting his blows be diverted harmlessly away. \n“Listen to me!” he called out. Oscar still did not respond, and the half-orc waited for an opening, deflected a swing that sent Oscar stumbling slightly, then connected his fist to Oscar’s face. Hard. \nOscar went sailing backward, landing on his back while his daggers clattered to the ground beside him.\nThe half-orc sheathed his weapons and kicked Oscar’s daggers away from him. Oscar lay on the ground, disoriented from the punch. “Why are you here?” he finally asked.\n“My name is Gell,” he began.\n“That’s not what I asked you,” said Oscar, rubbing his forehead.\n“I tracked you this morning. I saw you come into the tavern last night, you came in looking like you’d seen a spirit, you were shaking, panting. You sat at the bar for over half an hour without ordering a thing, then left. You walked into the woods and slept in a tree. That doesn’t add up to normal behavior. Something is wrong, I’m just trying to figure out what. Maybe I can help you.”\n“You can’t. There’s nothing you can do for me right now. It’s something I need to do myself. I don’t need your help,” Oscar replied. He knew that having the skill of a warrior such as this one would help immensely in his fight, but he was too stubborn. He’d made up his mind to do this alone.\n“Fair enough. I will respect your wishes. Don’t worry, I wasn’t going through your things, I was only waiting for you to wake up. Perhaps I’ll see you in the future.”\n“I doubt it. Just leave me alone and stay out of my way. I’d prefer it if you left now, Gell,” Oscar said with hostility. He began to pick himself up from the ground.\nGell nodded, backing away from Oscar’s camp and silently turning around, then walking back toward the city. Oscar tried to clear his head. He felt badly for treating the half-orc with such disrespect and hostility when he had been shown none. It was too late to fix things now. Oscar was feeling too many emotions, being forced to deal with too much in the last day. Oscar took down his bedroll and packed his things, readying himself for travel. Oscar took a final look at his camp, making sure that he hadn’t forgotten anything, then turned his back on it and walked on toward the city.\nOscar was very hungry, having not eaten the night before. Upon arriving in the city around midday, he found that the city square, Shingen’s primary center of commerce, was filled with several dozen angry people. They were all yelling over one another over whether or not another tavern was truly necessary for the city, as Shingen had already had four, and there was an ever increasing number of crimes every month that were traced back to the abuse of alcohol. Many people saw no harm in the addition of a fifth tavern to the city, but there were a select few that were strongly against it. \nOscar decided to use this commotion to his advantage. He worked his way into the bustling crowd, stealthily reaching his fur-covered hand into the pockets of unsuspecting and disgruntled individuals, taking their coin purses. He knew that Marcus would frown upon him for this behavior, but in a way, Oscar saw this as a way of helping Marcus. In order to avenge Marcus, Oscar needed to be alive. This was the only way that he could see to do so. \nOscar was about to reach his hand into the pocket of his final victim, when suddenly he felt a tight grip around his wrist. The person he’d tried to pickpocket had caught him in the act. This man was massive. Oscar recognized him as the one known here in the city as The Human Hill. Aptly named for his enormous size and threatening stature, the man would easily tower over Braun. The man had been the source for many troubles in the city. The giant sausages that he called fingers were wrapped tightly around Oscar’s thin wrist. The Human Hill looked down at Oscar, grabbed him by his neck, hoisted him into the air, and tossed him like a small stone across the paved street. Oscar landed and rolled, stumbling and falling over himself. He’d become careless, he’d tried to take too much. All he had really needed was money to buy himself food. The Human Hill waked away from the crowd, making his way toward Oscar, who attempted to pick himself off of the ground quickly. The Human Hill reached him rapidly, picking Oscar up again and thrashing his body around like a ragdoll and smashing him against a nearby wall. Oscar was being flung around as if he weighed nothing. Oscar was tossed to the ground again. He unsheathed his sword, prepared to fight this beast of a man. The Human Hill swatted his blade aside with ease. Oscar began to step backward. His sword was out of reach now. Oscar attempted to throw a punch at the monstrous man, but his fist was caught by an enormous hand, crushing his fingers. The Human Hill reached for Oscar again when suddenly a small stone flew through the air on a direct collision course with The Human Hill’s head. The moment the stone made contact, it exploded and a deafening BOOM accompanied by a bright flash of light filled the city square. Oscar’s ears rang so loudly he could hardly hear a thing around him. His eyesight returned after a few moments. Everyone in the square had stopped their bickering and turned to look at them. The Human Hill was standing there, but seemed unresponsive. His eyes rolled slowly into the back of his head as he began to fall backwards off of his feet. He hit the ground on his back, causing vibrations as well as several cracks in the street. He lay still, neither breathing nor moving at all. Oscar looked into the direction where the stone came from. He spotted Gell, the half-orc from the forest, walking toward him. He had another person with him, a human dressed in simple robes, carrying a sword across his back. \nOscar’s ears still rang from the stone, but he could hear Gell say to him, “You sure you don’t need help?”\nOscar wasn’t sure what he should say, but he started by saying, “Thank you. You really saved my skin there. What was that thing?”\n“A thunderstone,” Gell said, showing Oscar another small stone with a lightning bolt carved onto one side. “Upon impact, thunderstones create a loud, explosive sound and a brilliant light, disorienting enemies. In some cases, they can be lethal.”\n“I think this may have been one of those times,” the human next to Gell said.\n“Who’s this?” asked Oscar.\n“This is a friend. I left him behind this morning so as not to intimidate you. His name is Seph,” Gell explained, “You know, I never did catch yours.”\n“I didn’t give it. My name is… Oscar,” he said reluctantly. He wasn’t sure about these people, but after thinking it over, Oscar decided it would be a good idea to invest in any possible ally he could get.\n“Pleasure,” mumbled Seph, followed closely by a loud burp. He sounded drunk. Perhaps he was at the tavern with Gell the previous night. \n“The pleasure is mine,” Oscar responded, shaking his sticky hand.\n“You seem to be in a much better mood than this morning. You’re a very pleasant person when you aren’t leaping from a tree and trying to kill me,” Gell said. \n“I apologize for that. I’ve been going through a lot lately. It was a long day yesterday.”\n\tThe crowd that had gathered in the city square was only about half of its original size. After witnessing the killing, many people had fled. The rest stayed out of morbid curiosity, wondering what would happen to the sorry lot that had gotten themselves mixed up in all of this. \n\tA fanfare was heard in the distance, and the sound of horseshoe on stone signaled the approach of the king’s guard. They drew nearer, and more of the crowd scattered. Only about eight individuals stayed behind to watch what would happen. The king’s guard entered the city square, three men in mail suits with the crest of Solace across a tunic on their chests. The men carried flags with the same blazing sun imprinted upon them. The also carried hand crossbows and rapiers at their sides. The men approached Oscar, Gell, and Seph.\n\t“You, half-orc,” the man in front called, pointing to Gell. “Are you the one that threw the thunderstone?”\n\t“I am,” Gell said.\n\t“Only in order to save me,” Oscar said. He wasn’t sure why he’d said it, maybe he just felt bad for his behavior that morning. “I was the one fighting him.”\n\t“Then the both of you can come with us. King Fernando would like a word,” The man said. He wore a shining helmet, and his horse was covered in an armor that was encrusted with gold. Oscar knew him to be the captain of the guard, Jaeger. Jaeger's word was law in Shingen, and Oscar knew better than to try to defy him. \nPerhaps this wasn't all bad. This had granted Oscar an opportunity to gain an audience with the king. Granted, he would most likely be addressing the king as a prisoner, but he would be addressing the king no less. Oscar and Gell presented their wrists to Jaeger, and the two other guards placed shackles on them. \n\"Hey, I'm with him,\" Seph slurred drunkenly. \n\"Seph, you idiot,\" Gell said, rubbing his forehead with his shackled hands. \nSeph presented his hands and another pair of shackles were placed on his wrists. Seph smiled at Gell, who simply sighed. \nJaeger attached a chain to each of their shackles, trailing it behind his horse. \"Keep up,\" he said. He let out a \"hyah\" as he got his horse trotting. Oscar, Gell, and Seph trailed behind his horse, dragged along by the chain. The other guards trotted along on either side of them.\n\"Why did you say that, Seph?\" Gell asked.\n\"I thought he was going to split us up,\" Seph responded, still slurring his words. \n\"You could have been fine, you didn't even do anything, they didn't even know that we were affiliated with one another.\"\n\"What?\" Seph asked. He seemed entirely lost.\n\"You didn't have to say anything, you didn't commit a crime,\" Gell explained.\n\"Ah, really?\" Seph said.\n\"Quiet down back there,\" Jaeger said without looking back.\nThey were approaching the steps to the castle. They saw the golden statue of Solace that stood at the base of the hill, at the beginning of the steps. A brilliant golden knight, kneeling and staring skyward, clutching the hilt of a sword that was buried halfway into the ground. \nHigh on the hill, Oscar could see it in the distance. They began climbing the stone stairs, led by Jaeger on his horse, making their way toward the palace at the top. \nAt the top of the steps, Oscar, Gell, and Seph saw the massive castle doors. They were made of ancient, cracked, dark wood, reinforced and studded with heavy iron. The castle itself was made of stone with gold trimming that was beginning to fade in some places. Spires climbed into the sky, topped with waving flags that featured a golden sun on a crimson field. \nThe enormous doors opened, creaking with every inch that it swung. More guards had been standing by the doors, just outside, wielding halberds. Jaeger and his men climbed off of their horses, and the men that stood by the doors walked over and took hold of the reigns, leading them around to what could be assumed were stables. \nJaeger, still holding the chain, led Oscar, Seph, and Gell into the castle. The inside was every bit as ornate as one might assume a castle would be, suits of armor, paintings, tapestries, and woven rugs were frequent sights within its walls. He led them through and closer to the king’s chamber.He stopped and turned around, signalling for his men to stop walking as well. He reached into a pouch on his side and pulled out a set of keys, going to each of them and unlocking their shackles.\n“King Fernando will not speak to you unless you are unbound. It is a sign of respect,” Jaeger explained. He finished unchaining them, then led them into Fernando’s chamber. He opened the door, allowing them to enter first, then followed shortly afterward. \nThe throne room was enormous, with high, vaulted ceilings, lavish paintings, statues, and furniture, and a large stained glass mural behind Fernando’s throne, depicting Solace in his golden armor. Fernando sat in his throne, a large chair encrusted with jewels and trimmed with gold. The seat appeared to be a deep crimson velvet. \nFernando himself was quite a sight, with his golden mail and chestplate. His crown was the purest color of gold that Oscar had ever seen. He held a scepter that appeared to be encrusted with jewels as well. King Fernando spoke, saying, “Leave us, Jaeger. I would prefer to speak with these men alone.”\nJaeger seemed hesitant for a moment, but quickly nodded his head, saying, “Yes, my king,” then backing out of the room, closing the door behind him. \nFernando directed his attention to the trio that stood before him and kneeled, bowing their heads. Almost immediately, Seph began to break down, falling to his knees and sobbing.\n“I don’t want to go to prison, I’m too innocent, I don’t even belong here! I didn’t do it, I swear, it was all these two!” He exclaimed.\nKing Fernando began, “Pull yourself together, this isn’t what it seems like. Cliff Erikson. Known to most people in this city as ‘The Human Hill’. That man has been causing this city grief for many years. He has killed, robbed, and disturbed the peace too many times to keep track. My personal guard has been unable to detain him under any situation. Now suddenly you three come into this city, and within a single day, you’ve removed the most dangerous criminal in the city from the streets. I apologize for having you brought here in chains. The reason I have called you here to meet you is to thank you for doing this city such a service. Being king, I’m not able to condone the murder of a citizen, much less praise it publically, therefore, I needed to make it appear that you were being arrested. Tonight we shall have a feast, and you shall stay the night in the castle, in the unused barracks in the West wing. If you have any requests, by all means, feel free to ask. This city is indebted to you.”\nOscar couldn’t believe his stroke of sheer dumb luck. He was completely bewildered.\n“Thank you very much, your majesty,” Gell said to him.\nOscar and Seph followed suit, Seph wiping the tears from his eyes and still trying to hold it together from the breakdown he’d experienced earlier. \nFernando continued, exalting them for their great deed to the city. When he was done, he dismissed them, and Oscar asked if there might be a time when he could bring up a matter of great importance concerning the villages near Shingen. King Fernando granted Oscar another audience with him alone that afternoon. \nOscar anxiously waited for the designated time of his meeting with King Fernando. Once the eternity had passed, he was finally able to speak to the king. He was brought back into the throne room, alone this time. He addressed Fernando with a bow, thanking him for giving him the opportunity. \n“What troubles you, my friend?” Fernando asked him.\nOscar detailed the events of the previous day. He told Fernando about the necromancer, and how it had burned Arrow’s Peak to the ground. Oscar told him that as far as he knew, he was the only survivor. Oscar said that he was worried about other villages nearby, and told Fernando that the necromancer bore the mark of Lum. Until that point, Fernando had seemed invested in the story, but the word Lum struck a chord with him. He reacted immediately. \n“I see,” he said, “This is not good. We have been receiving reports of villages being attacked by creatures that appeared to be undead, and some even claimed to see a figure that appeared to be controlling them. These were usually stories of faraway outposts, but they’ve been growing closer and closer in recent days, though never anything so close as Arrow’s Peak. I am deeply sorry to hear this news. This is an act of war against the followers of Solace. This menace must be disposed of. We have heard whisperings of a camp, northwest of the city, where the necromancer is said to be staying. It is several days away from here, and we have no confirmed evidence. You have seen what it can do first hand, and you survived. I’d like you to go on an expedition there. If you find him, and you defeat him, you can come back expecting a heavy bounty. Do you accept?”\n“I do,” said Oscar.\n“This being is a threat to our way of life. He must be exterminated. Gather a team, I shall supply you with mounts for your journey. You shall leave tomorrow morning.”\n“Yes, your majesty,” Oscar said.\n“I would like for you to take along my daughter, Scarlet. She will not be a burden, she is as skilled a warrior as any you might meet. She shall be prepared to leave tomorrow morning. Gather your team and have them meet with us on the palace steps at dawn. Do not forget the banquet is to be held tonight.”\n“I shall not. I will be prepared before dawn tomorrow.”\nTheir meeting ended, and Oscar bowed once again before the mighty king. On his way out of the throne room, Oscar had a feeling that he was being watched. He felt a stare burning into his back. Oscar turned around and looked down the hallway, seeing a tapestry move slightly, as if a person had moved by it quickly. Oscar took another look around before turning back and walking down the hall toward the barracks where he, Gell, and Seph were staying. It wasn’t long before Oscar felt another stare on his back. He quickly turned around, catching the foot of a person as they rounded the corner. \n“Come back!” He called out, following them around the corner. When Oscar turned the corner, he saw nothing but an empty corridor. He sighed and continued on his way. It was the third time that Oscar felt the stare when he called out, “I know you’re there!” turning around to see no sign of a person anywhere. When he turned back, he saw her, standing in front of him. She had dark hair, it was cut at her shoulders. She wore a hooded cloak that concealed most of her face until she took it down.\n“Hello,” she said.\n“Why were you following me?” Oscar asked.\n“My name is Scarlet, my father says I’ll be joining you on your expedition tomorrow.”\n“You’re Fernando’s daughter?” Oscar asked her. \n“Unless everything I’ve been brought up to know is a lie, then yes, I’m fairly certain.”\nShe looked like a princess, with small yet defined facial features. But Oscar could see the fire in her eyes, he knew that this was not a person that he would want to cross. They spoke for a few minutes, before Oscar retired back to the barracks with Gell and Seph. \nUpon his arrival in the barracks, Oscar told them about what he and Fernando had discussed. Oscar asked the both of them if they would do him the honor of joining him, though they had only been acquaintances a few short hours. The pair both agreed to join him.\nThe banquet that night was magnificent, especially since Oscar had been unable to eat for the entire day. They gorged on a vast array of foods, including many types of fowl, beef, and even something reptilian that Oscar didn’t recognize. \nAfter the banquet, Oscar, Gell, and Seph decided to try their luck in the city, asking people to join their cause. They had next to no luck until they attempted to recruit people inside The Rusty Flagon. The promise of coin drew the attention of many, but a description of the dangers that the mission entailed deterred them in most cases. \nBy the end of the night, their list of volunteers lay barren save for a single man named Philip, who was so drunk at the time that the trio of warriors doubted that he would even remember signing up by the morning.Braun began cleaning up the tavern as patrons slowly started to head home for the night. He approached their table, cleaning a tankard with a rag.\n“How’d things go tonight, folks? Any promising volunteers?” He asked.\n“No luck, unfortunately,” Gell said.\n“Oh, that’s too bad,” Braun said, picking up a plate from a nearby table, “what do you suppose you’ll do?”\n“I suppose we’ll just have to do it with the four of us, perhaps we can ask Fernando if he could spare a few troops,” Oscar explained.\n“Could I be of any help?” Braun asked,”I’m not experienced in fighting, but I’m decently strong. I could have the other workers cover for me for the next few days.”\n“Really?” Oscar said, bewildered, “ that would be amazing. I won’t lie to you, this is going to be dangerous. There is a very real chance that we could be unsuccessful. There’s a high bounty though, you wouldn’t need to work anymore if we succeeded.”\n“I don’t need money, I enjoy working here, but I haven’t left this city in years. And it seems that you’re in need of all the help you can get. Plus, if this being is as dangerous as you’ve said, he could pose a serious threat to the city. If we don’t deal with it now, we may have to end up dealing with it later.” Braun set the plate and the tankard down, coming closer to the table and signing his name on the parchment. “When and where are we meeting?”\n“Tomorrow at dawn, in front of the castle. We’ll be departing at around noon,” Oscar told him.\n“I’ll be there,” Braun said.\nThe trio headed back to the castle for the night as Braun closed down the tavern. It was nighttime, and the moon shone through the clouds, but it paled in comparison to the lanterns of the city. It was illuminated so well that if one were to keep from looking at the sky, one would almost think it were midday. Oscar thought that it was amazing that the people of Shingen were able to create this illusion, he thought that the city was beautiful at night. \nGell and Seph slept well that night. Surprisingly, the half-orc slept almost silently, while Seph snore obnoxiously loud. Oscar wasn’t sure he liked Seph, but Gell seemed to think he was alright, and Gell seemed to be trustworthy. Oscar had had trouble sleeping that night, tossing and turning, flashing back to Arrow’s Peak, watching the necromancer ravage his tiny village. Watching his fellow warriors being overpowered and swallowed up by mounds of hideous creatures with gnashing teeth and jagged claws. He saw the necromancer, standing across from him, staring into him with invisible eyes, hidden beneath its hood. \nOscar opened his eyes. It was nearly morning already. Seph was still snoring, the sound being interrupted by the first sounds of birds outside the windows. Oscar decided to get up. He began preparing for the journey, dressing and packing the essentials. \nAt dawn, five adventurers stood at the castle entrance, atop five brilliant white horses. A sixth horse stood with them, meant for carrying supplies and acting as a spare in the case that one of their horses became unusable. Oscar, Gell, Seph, Scarlet, and Braun were looking down over the city, talking about the journey that lay ahead. King Fernando sent them off around noon, sending the five of them toward the northwest, into the direction that they believed the Necromancer had established his claim. \nThe first day of their journey was mostly uneventful, traveling through forest trees, stopping occasionally for meals. The adventurers stopped their travels when the sun disappeared behind the trees and the sky began to grow dark. \nThey made camp in a small clearing, building a fire and laying out their bedrolls. They sat around the fire, and Braun told stories of being in Fernando’s personal military, several decades prior. Braun was an older man, close to 60 years of age, and had served for fourteen years under the flag of Solace from the age of 17. Gell and Seph spoke of an adventure in nearby ruins, where they encountered a beast with a mangled head that had chased them nearly all the way to Shingen. Scarlet talked about life in the castle, training with her father and several tutors, learning archery and stealth, using her skills to sneak out of the castle on occasion to walk through the city at night. Oscar told stories about his time with Marcus, learning his ways, growing up with the faction, telling the story of the bravery of the fighters that fell on the day that the necromancer attacked. Oscar stopped talking, saddened by his own story. \nHe told the others that he was going to go to sleep, taking his bedroll away from the fire and finding cover under a large tree nearby. Oscar laid there for a few hours, he wasn’t sure how many. He didn’t know when he fell asleep, but he woke up to the sun shining through the leaves. \nThe group packed up and began riding. They decided to stop in a nearby village that was marked on the map to stock up on supplies and get their bearings. They rode in the direction marked on their map, not straying too far from their path. \nIt was around midday when they saw the smoke in the air. They stopped, unsure of whether or not they should continue.\n\nI had to cut it short because of the character limit, you can find the rest in the comments. This was just a rough draft and will be heavily edited in the future. Please give me any criticisms you have, I'm looking for any way to improve it. If you read the whole thing, thank you, I hope you enjoyed it. I'm looking forward to any comments or feedback you guys have to offer. \nSorry if I'm in the wrong subreddit for this, I'm new.

        "text": "Ok, So I'm going to try and write down a few of the stories that came from the Campaign that I played this last weekend. Every game was epic and awesome and I'm going to miss a lot of the epic moments of the games. When I started on the second game, at this point, one city had already been destroyed along with the 600 innocents who the Big bad had taken prisoner. However, we accomplished our objective, find and stop anymore people from disappearing. More importantly, we got paid.\n\nThe second game started with us on the way to another city to stop the Kobolds that were raiding the city. There are 12 of us, all level 1. We have 2 Cleric types, 2 Fighter Types, 4 Wizard types, and 4 Rouge types. Two of our members are Dragonborn and everyone except 2 speak Draconic. I am playing a Rouge and I've optimized my character for Stealth and throwing knives at people.\nSo what happens is that we have a group of myself, another rouge, and a fighter who said he had a high sneak as scouts. We are out in front of the party, our job is to observe and report. Until the fighter fails his sneak check. As a result of this, I have to make another sneak check and fail. The two of us are instantly surrounded by too many Kobolds so the third Rouge goes and gets the Calvary.\n\nThey come charging in with the Dragonborn Fighter leading the way to save us. He rolls to attack and gets a Natural 1. DM numbers off myself, him, another party member, and a random kobold as 1,2,3,4. I'm at 1 hit point, if he hits me, I'm dead, so I'm kinda nervous as the d4 is thrown. It comes up a 3 and so he hits a different party member.\n\nThe DM thinks about this for a second and has the Kobolds stop attacking for a second as they try to process what is happening. I back up into the safty of the party and say in draconic to the Dagonborn. \"Do you want us to kill them, Master?\" The Dragonborn hover, just keeps attacking and kills one of the Kobolds. Talking is a free action and so the Kobolds are like \"Why did you kill him!\" The Dragonborn replies \"he insulted me\" and makes the bluff check. The Kobolds fall down and start to worship him.\n\nThis is when our other Dragonborn, a talky Rouge, steps in and claims to be his consort, asking why they were attacking the trade route we had been sent to protect. We interrogate the Kobolds and find out that they have to raid the route because of the demands of their new God of fire and smoke who is living in their Kobold 'City'. We manage to convince them that our Dragonborn were the true Gods and the fire and smoke was a false one.\n\nWe decide to head straight there and recruit the Kobolds along the way to serve their new 'God'. We manage to recruit 82 Kobolds on the way. They have recalled all of their warriors to the city to defend it from us 'heritics'.\n\nWe set up out warcamp outside their walls. We eventually decide we need more intelligence and so we decide to send our four rouges in to figure out what exactly we were facing.\nMe and one of our rouges fail our sneak checks and so the battle starts early. However, two of them manage to make it into the city and deep into the tunnels where they find five young adult Dragons. (CR 5, each) This is when the Dragonborn Rouge fails her sneak check and wakes them all up. The last hidden Rouge decides to get out of there and try a different tunnel.\n\nMeanwhile, we are fighting the Kobolds and they are winning hands down. To turn the tide of battle, one of our casters charges into the middle of them and unleashes a massive area effect spell and turns the tide in our favor. That is until the five dragons come roaring out of the cave and destroying everything.\n\nI had managed to slip past them into the cave and met up with the Drqagonborn Rouge who is carrying the other Rouge. Turns out that when he had slipped away, he had found himself in the room that the Kobold leader slept in. So he decided to take a shot and rolls a natural 1, shooting himself in the foot. He maxes damage and so knocks himself out. However, he succeeded in his check to not cry out from the pain. The Dragonborn Rouge made a series of tumble checks to get away from the Dragons and then her stealth check to hide from them. She comes across the other rouge slumped against the wall with his own arrow in his foot. She rips it out of his foot and kills the Kobold leader.\n\nWhat she did not tell me was that while she searched the room, she found a magical orb that exuded a 'my precious' type effect. She was going to get him to the healer and I was going to find some magical weapons to fight the Dragons with.\n\nShe leaves the cave and sees the five Dragons ravaging our main party who are trying to go for a 'If it bleeds, we can kill it.' To rally our Kobold allies. The dragons don't really care who is friend or foe, they are just killing/eating everyone. Three of them are strafing us with fire breath and two of them are fighting us on the ground.\n\nShe decides to try and activate the orb. The DM goes, 'ok, what are you going to try to do?' She pretty much says, \"Summon Bigger Fish.' That is when an ancient Colossal Bronze Dragon shows up. He lets out a mighty roar that terrifies everyone.\nI run out of the cave with the weapons that I've gathered. When I saw the Colossal Dragon, there was only one appropriate response. I dropped the weapons and went 'oh shit.'\n\nThe bronze dragon won and landed with it's hand stretched out towards the Dragonborn Rouge. The orb might have a 'My Precious' effect, but when an Elder Dragon who has just saved your ass asks for something, you give it to them. He proceeds to collapse the Kobold cave and fly away. There are no Kobold survivors.\n\nThat one Crit Fail at the start of the Game ended up as the most beneficial thing we could have done. It was also the second city that we destroyed. However, we accomplished our goal, the Kobolds were not going to be a problem along that trade route for a very long time. We got paid, things were good.\n\nIf you like this story, I'll tell you about us going three for three and screwing with this Wizard.",

        "text": "This is my first post here, so I apologize for any formatting errors or just plain poor formatting on my part. \n\nSo long story short, my PCs were able to obtain a deck of many things as a quest reward. The deck does its rounds around the party and eventually stops at the wizard, who decides he only wants to draw one card. That's cool, no problem. The card ends up granting him a 4th level Fighter to aid him in battles, along with the rest of the group. I ended up pulling the NPC from a random pool, and it just so happened to land on a CR1 diseased fighter (Fighter 4). So I apologize and give him his handy sidekick - an equipmentless warrior with an INT of 8, AC of 7, and 22 HP - that has random bouts of insanity because of his ailment. Seeing how his INT was a mere 8, I decided to go ahead and make him pretty stupid with a limited vocabulary. The wizard sighs and everybody collectively decides to name him \"Opie\".\n\nShortly after his appearance, the group finds that Opie is looking uncomfortable and sort of angry; this causes Opie to lunge after the bard and miss horribly. As a result, the group decides to hold Opie on a 5-ft long leash, and they calm him down by giving him a shiny gold coin. Opie becomes enchanted with the shiny and simmers down, trudging along with the group by leash. After this ordeal, I told my players that they needed to occasionally occupy Opie with shiny objects, or he would get very upset from \"boredom\" after periods of time. Well, this doesn't really go as planned and the party forgets to check on Opie after a few hours. As they're passing a travelling merchant, Opie goes into a rage and starts shouting and grunting, reaching toward the merchant's shiny sword. This causes the bard to get mad at Opie, so he backhands the poor fighter across the face and tells him to straighten up, which in turn sends Opie into a space-off PTSD episode in which the group learns about a bard in Opie's childhood that did very mean things to him (won't go into detail). Soon after, the bard apologizes and gives Opie three shiny gold coins, which causes him to become entranced by the dazzling lights gleaming from them.\n\nNow they keep him along with the group - presumably as trap bait - but I have a feeling that everybody is gonna be sad when/if Opie dies. They seem to like tying him off on trees and such when they're about to go into battle or a shop.\n\nTL;DR: Wizard attains NPC Fighter 4 as an ally, winds up being a homely sub-par IQ warrior with bouts of insanity and has to be calmed down by shiny objects several times per day, or he will go into a retard rage against the bard",

        "text": "I'm having mixed feelings about the attention I've been getting since we've been down this mine.\n\nOn the plus side, everyone's been a lot nicer to me!  I'm not sure, but I think they might actually give a damn if I get hurt.  So sweet.  The not so great news - we're going to run out of oxygen in a few hours and we have no light source except for, well, me.  I'm the light source, as well as the poor schmuck who can see into the darkness.  Let me tell you, it's not fun.  I'm a pretty easy-going guy, but fuck me the warp has some scary shit in it sometimes.\n\nI don't really want to think about it.  I'm just going to make this light a bit brighter to be on the safe side.\n\nWorking for the Inquisition is never dull though.  Being bored is my worst nightmare, but hunting heretics has definitely put that fear into perspective.  It's made me notice I have balls of steel!  You'd think the tough looking Feral-Worlders would give no fucks about man-eating shadows or zombie miners (I just realised I fought both type of \"miners\" down here.  Word play is fucking amazing), but I've seen them freeze, faint and fall to fits of fanatical laughter.  Meanwhile I've *really* seen some shit.  Like, 'looked into the warp and it looked back' kind of fuckery.  I've never lost my nerve.\n\nSure, I made the walls bleed that one time, but it could have been SO much worse!  It's a harmless psychic discharge.  Well - harmless *for us*.  You do have to wonder where the warp gets all that blood from.\n\nLooks like I need another change of topic.\n\nOh right - *the mission*.  Long story short: we need to turn on a generator, rescue a cleric and get the fuck out of here.  Turning on the power should sort out that 'running out of air' issue, plus the lights come back on.  Usually that would be easy because our Tech Priest is worth her salt.  The problem with that though is she's not with us down here, but rather in the security office above ground watching us on the cameras.  Don't ask me how the cameras have fucking power - she ignored me when I asked.  They must have some sort of battery inside them.  It makes you ask the question why they don't have back up lighting or an emergency air supply for this occasion.  Maybe they spent their budget on those fancy security cameras?  That way they'll die, but whoever finds the security footage will have recordings of them choking to death and they'll all become snuff film celebrities!  Someone in the Inquisition definitely sells that sort of thing, you can't convince me that they don't.\n\nI'm getting off point again.  Our Tech Priest is leading us to the generator room.  Since I'm the only one who has half a brain - counting out the Feral-Worlders and the Cleric who thinks with his fists - I get to be her extra pair of hands, while she instructs me over comms with what the fuck I need to do to get this bitch working again.  So, not only am I the human torch and scrying machine, but I'm now also designated Tech Priest puppet.\n\nDoes my usefulness know no end?  I'm beginning to think not.",

        "text": "My first post here, so I apologize if I have missed any protocol (and would appreciate it being pointed out). A brief history: I am the Storyteller (henceforth the ST) for a nWoD crossover utilizing as much 2e rules as possible. That being said, there were 2 mages at the start (now 3), and MtAw 2e hasn't been completed, so I am pulling as much of the 2e update from the dev blogs as I can (also Promethean). I believe we are now 6 sessions in. I will try to make this as much a story as possible, with brief explanations being posted in the comments. This part of the story includes the introduction scenes for all of the characters except one. On to the story.\n\nWhile poring over case precedents for the latest case he has been assigned to, Evan Landers notices the lead attorney for the case pass by the door, heading for Mr. Horowitz's office with a look of irritation. He overhears a conversation about himself, the lead attorney clearly not happy with the recent addition to his case. Evan hears Mr. Horowitz's phone ring, interrupting the conversation. Soon after, Evan watches as the lead attorney walks by the door, and Mr. Horowitz calls Evan into his office. Evan discovers that Mr. Behrman, a city councilor, has called, requesting a meeting with Mr. Landers. Though it is highly unusual that a new attorney with no case history would be specifically requested, Mr. Horowitz agrees to send Evan. Mr. Horowitz promises that if Evan gets in good with Mr. Behrman, he will make sure Evan is given the opportunity to prove himself to the firm. Evan is instructed to meet Mr. Behrman at a benefit auction being held at the Central Library that night.\n\nMeanwhile across town, the sun has just dropped behind the horizon, causing the clouds of steam and smoke in the industrial district to take on an almost blood-red hue. A train enters an old railyard and comes to a stop, the engineer stepping out moments later, weary of body, but eyes shifting nervously. He scurries off to check in and clock out, leaving the rail yard eerily quiet. Soon after, the side door of any empty rail car of the now-still train opens, and out steps Trinome. He pauses a moment to get his bearings, and hears muffled laughter coming from the other side of the rail yard. He notices a faint light coming from another derelict rail car, and decides to investigate. Upon approach, he sees three teenagers hunched over some sort of board, and each has both hands on some sort of plastic object they appear to be moving across the board. He hears one of the kids ask nervously, \"What is it saying? 'Look up'?\" They look up to see a large man with strongly angular features watching them. Trinome asks them what they are playing with, and they tell him it is a Ouija Board. He is curious, so they briefly explain that you touch it and ask it a question, and it will give an answer. He immediately touches it, and asks where he can find a computer. One of the teenagers tells him that she heard the Central Library would be open late, to which he responds, \"Are you the Ouija?\" At this point, the teenagers believe he is mentally handicapped, and so offer him a ride to the library, to which he accepts.\n\nAn hour later, in a dark club somewhere downtown, Ardnt Foley sits waiting for his phone to ring. With its dark gray walls, black furniture, dark red-tinted lighting, and loud rock and roll, this place feels like your typical every-night Rack. No surprise, then, that a half-dozen vampires are already picking out their next meal like a millionaire browsing a wine list. Too bad he isn't there for the \"tasting\". After nearly a half-hour of waiting, his phone finally rings. He answers the phone, knowing his superior would be on the other end. The noise, however, is a bit too loud to hear Cedric on the other end. After seeing the front door is momentarily blocked by a large influx of patrons, he decides to move to the bathroom in hopes of a quieter location. Finally, Cedric is able to relay a message from another of Ardnt's superiors, Jacqués. After a meeting with the city's Harpy, Jacqués has a possible lead on a mage that might be able to.assist them with their plans. Cedric instructs Ardnt to make his way to the Central Library where there will be a benefit auction. The Harpy indicated that a particularly rare book on cryptozoology - *Searching the Fog: a Treatise on the Hidden Bayou* - is to be auctioned off, and it is known that a particular mage is interested in buying it. He is to seek out this mage and strike a deal with him. \n\nNot far from the dark club, in a poorly lit parking lot, Genesis steps out of his car. The lights of the city seem small, as if the darkness is offended by their intrusion, the sounds of the city seem somehow subdued. It took longer to get here than anticipated; a fatal four-car pileup on I-45 delayed southbound traffic for hours. Going in blind certainly isn't the favorable method, but this is what the client wants. He makes his way on foot toward the Central Library. The client was certain his mark would be at the benefit auction tonight, and the client was adamant about making the mark's death a very public spectacle. Upon passing a dark alley, Genesis hears the shuffling of someone trying to move quietly behind him. He turns to find an old man, his hand still outstretched toward him. The man is probably in his sixties, with long, unkempt hair and beard. His pungent odor hints at his lack of access to a good shower, and he looks as if he hasn't eaten in weeks. He has a terrible look of fright on his face. Genesis quickly deduces the man's intent, hands him $20, and says, \"if you need money, just ask.\" He then turns and continues on to the library. Genesis was glad he had remembered to use his praxis to hide his sword after getting out of the car - that could have been awkward.\n\nEvan arrives at the library first, and after a brief wait, he is approached by James Behrman. James informs Evan that officially he wants Evan to handle James' sister's case, and that he will send his personal assistant Nigel to Evan's firm with the case file and instructions to give Evan lead on the case. Behrman’s real reason for contacting Evan is that a fellow Guardian of the Veil suggested Evan for a special task.  At this point, Trinome arrives and finds a vacant computer terminal. He isn't sure why, but somehow he knows that he is capable of \"plugging-in\" to the computer. He puts his finger to the USB port, and for a brief moment, a humanoid machine sits at the computer in place of the man sharp, angular features. He recalls the lab where he first awoke, the image of the man's badge, the man telling him to run. CTI - Cyanotec Industries, Inc - this is what he wants to know about. Soon after, Ardnt walks through the lobby, slipping quietly into the auction, waiting to see if the book has already come up, and if not, who will be bidding on it. It isn't long before the book in question comes up for auction, and after a few bids, James secures the book. Genesis arrives shortly after, and easily locates the auction. Trinome's attempt making little progress, he gives up, and takes notice of the strangely dressed man crossing the lobby. He decides to follow him. Genesis slips in and finds a vacant seat, unaware that he is being followed. Trinome finds a place near the back wall and observes the auction and all that unfolds. \n\nThe moment Genesis entered the room, both Evan and James sensed the power of an active spell. James releases a small amount of his mana, granting him Supernal Vision, revealing to him the various forms of resonance in the room. James' reaction prompts Evan to cast a quick spell, allowing him to blend into the crowd. Genesis senses the release of mana, and creates an imago to grant himself 360 degree vision. James scrutinizes the recent arrivals, beginning with Ardnt. His strangely pale aura is somewhat familiar to James, who identifies him as a vampire. He then discovers the fiery aura surrounding Trinome, and is immediately intrigued by this unknown variance. Trinome takes notice of James' overly intense stare, and puts a finger to his lips, causing James to react with a small amount of surprise. James moves on, and immediately recognizes the resonance of forces spell being used to hide something. James concentrates on a familiar imago, one that will allow him to speak directly into the mind of Genesis. He asks Genesis to follow him to a quieter location, and Genesis agrees. He then signals for Evan to follow, and sensing the hand of fate, decides to ask Ardnt and Trinome to follow as well, to which both agree. \n\nJames leads them to a secluded meeting room where introductions are made. James had already guessed that Genesis has been sent to kill him, and he also has a good idea who hired him. Genesis was not told his mark was a mage, leading him to reevaluate the situation. After Genesis' passing reference to lost memories, James promises to uncover his suppressed memories in exchange for his help, to which Genesis agrees. He then listens to Ardnt's case, and agrees to help the vampires in exchange for their assistance with his mission, to which Ardnt also agrees after a phone call to Cedric. Finally, James uses his magic to scan Trinome's memories to determine what might have altered his aura, only to find that his memories extend back less than a week. James realizes the fundamental difference between Trinome and everyone else, and offers to help Trinome discover what he is in exchange for his help. Trinome agrees, while his exposure to James' magic stirred something inside him. James then instructs them to meet him the following night at Lucky's Pub at 10p for details on the mission. Trinome decides to seek out an old shipyard in hopes of finding an old abandoned ship, and hopefully one that still floats. Genesis finds a hotel to get some sleep while Evan returns to his apartment for the same. Ardnt returns to his covenant's hideout, where he hears Cedric and Jacqués arguing in French. When he enters the room, he finds an unfamiliar vampire sitting on the couch, a look of irritation on her face. Jacqués storms out of the room, and Cedric briefly explains that the Harpy required Jacqués take this fledgling in exchange for the information he sought. Cedric introduces her as Alexandria, and informs Ardnt that he would now be her mentor. Afterward. Cedric follows after Jacqués to continue the argument.",

        "text": "Elbow deep, I was, on Fifthday, shoulder-to-hip with a stinking sea of dock scum, cutthroats, street rats, the obligatory gaggle of painted meat-for-sale, slinking temple servants, off-duty craftsmen, sailors with a few hours to kill, and the inevitable troublemakers found in every tavern that ever opened its doors in a city with that many poor, destitute, screwed-up fuckers as the black Port of Galron was in those days.\n\nLike I said, it was Fifthday, and I was flush from three jobs all paid-up. I was here, in The Thorn, because I knew this place and I felt at home here. I finally caught Squint’s eye behind the slab of ironwood that passes for the trestle, and he hustled his fat ass over to me, dodging beneath the crush of patrons waving empty tankards\n\nI nodded at him, not daring to smile, and asked for a Dox, real polite, and showed him my coin.\n\nHe squinted at me with those evil piggy eyes and for a second I thought he was gonna turn me away for sure, knowing my need, hoping like hell he couldn’t see the sweatline framing my brow.\n\nI thought for sure he was gonna call over the Thugs and that would be the end, ya know?\n\n‘Cause no way is Squint gonna let me slide this time, even though I hadn’t actually done anything, but just ‘cause I was there, that could be enough, if Squint said so.\n\nIn this place, his word was Law, and even The goddamn Owl knew it, and none of His Claws ever came in here. No Law, no militia, no squealers ever fucked with Squint, and the fat bastard knew it. He had enough ears, tongues, toes and cocks nailed up above the trestle to prove it, too.\n\nI waited, and sweated, and tried to keep breathing through my mouth. The air was rank with blood and meat, seawater and spilled ale, and it was a hot night, shimmery-air kinda hot. The place was rollicking with drunken breaknecks and the great meaty bastards stank, like the asshole of the demon-whore Xxzzt stank, and I was swaying with the lot of them, one great big juggy sloshing bowl of drunkenfucks, like we was on some slaver weeks out t’sea. The babbling drunkchat was deafening, unbearable. The torches that spat on the walls threw greasy, choking smoke into the air and little light. It was dark and loud and full of stupid drunken men with lots of money. My kind of joint, ya know?\n\nI’m still waiting and then I saw Squint’s brow relax, and I knew he wasn’t going to turn me away. He kind of half-nodded at me, not even meeting my eye and plucked the silver ducat from my trembling hands.\n\nI waited until he was filling the ‘jack before I let out my breath real slow-like, and I could feel some of the icy fingers clutching my guts slip away. Squint turned with the tankard perfectly poured, a thick foamy head mushroomed slightly on top of the bitter brew and my mouth suddenly lost all of its moisture in anticipation, my tongue, all grit and fuzz, swiped over my lips and I could already taste the bastard, ya know? That feeling of gut-thirst? Like a goddamn hook in your belly.\n\nI’m jammed up next to some noneck and I could see immediately that he was a Crudder, some filth from eastside, some legbreaker off-duty and I smiled. The Sheep Drop would bring down this ape, quicker than a whore’s drawers on Third-day.\n\nAs Squint hands across the ‘jack the fuckin’ noneck jostles my elbow and half the fuckin’ Dox leaps out and across the trestle, splattering me, Squint, the noneck and some stinking halfbreed crammed in next to me.\n\nSquint shouldn't have cared, he’d already been paid, but all the same he bellowed like a sonofabitch and reared back a great hammy fist, ready to break jaw.\n\nI immediately drop down off the stool onto the floor, a stupid stupid idea, I know, but I didn’t want no trouble that day, no trouble at all, I just wanted a goddamn drink, ya know? I hear the flat smack of Squint’s meaty fist breaking the noneck’s nose and the outraged bellow in response.\n\nThe halfbreed above me who also got splashed decides to open his drunken mouth.\n\nAlways a good idea.\n\nI decide to get while the gettin’s good. I kick the stool out of the way and start to move away and stand up when the noneck fucker decides I was the problem after all and suckers me in the back of the head, felt like a goddamn sledge hit me, ya know? I stumble into the crowd, spilling ale, stepping on boots, and nearly go out. I know I’m gonna get shoved back towards the sonofabitch, and I know he’s waiting with another hammerblow that’s gonna knock me out, break my jaw and really fuck up my day, if I even survive, once I fall to the floor, but chances are I’d get stomped like a roach just for annoying these drunken psychopaths, ya know?\n\nI got once chance. Sheep Drop was my play, and I gotta stick with it, even if the timing’s lousy. I get my hand into my tunic and manage to grab the pouch before I’m thrown back.\n\nFuckin’ lucky, I know.\n\nI get pushed, hard, and as I’m turning I drop my head way down and throw my arms out, the pouch, upended, spills its bounty in a nice spray into the crowd, three dozen carefully weighted wooden discs, painted in gilt and embossed with the offical-looking profile of His Fucker, The Owl.\n\nAs I turn, I duck the haymaker, I even see the fucker’s eyes as he misses. It was nearly worth everything that came after on that day, and I crash into my stool and the trestle as the spray of ducats hits the ground. The crowd around me all does what they are supposed to do, they look at the ground and start grabbing and punching and slopping ale all over the floor trying to pick up the booty.\n\nThe noneck is among the grabbers and Squint has already turned away. The Halfbreed is arguing with someone else and didn’t even see the Sheep Drop. Crudders always carry their dosh on their belts, and this noneck filth is no exception. I see the pouch laying against his hip, nice and fat, and I think, “This chum’s just got paid”, and I lift the fat sack with the chock and snickety-snack I cut the tethers with my palm-cutter and push the dumb fucker as hard as I can and duck away into the crowd, past the halfbreed, and start squeezing through the bastards sideways and snake-like, slithering through the crowd, getting ready to call out “Imgonnabarf-watchoutmate-gonnathrowmygutsout”, when the crowd fuckin’ parts before me, like the floor was on fire and I can see the back door, out to the Trenchtown road, and the door was open and a mean looking bastard was standing there.\n\nHe was covered in blood and his clothes were shredded and the stink that poured from him instantly banished the putrid atmosphere in the place and set a new standard of disgusting. I had to hold my guts in, and no pretending, and he took a step forwards and when he did the whole place changed, ya know? It wasn’t silence, or electricity, or awe. It was way beyond that. It was … the power of … righteousness fulfilled. It was in my mind like the most perfect truth. I had no other thoughts in my head. It’s like I wasn’t there anymore, no mirror of self to reflect darkly, there was nothing but the truth of righteousness. I was the word, ya know, we were all the word, all of us there, even fatass Squint, and we knew this man.\n\nThis was a Speaker and he had a Tale.\n\nSome were driven away, fleeing through the door with hasty excuses on their minds, some urgency that could not wait, and although the ones who stayed did not scorn them aloud, they somehow thought them lesser for not having the strength, the faith to stay and Listen. The feeling of the shared experience felt less without them there, but the Truth, did not. It was like a livewire into your soul. It could not be denied. I wanted to Listen. I felt like I had no other purpose, ya know?\n\nA Speaker. I had been here many dozens of times, perhaps even a hundred, but I had never seen a Speaker enter. Many times I had been nearby and felt the pull. I always came, of course, and had Heard many tales, but this would be my first hearing of the Welcoming, and this Speaker had a tale that was immediate, and we could feel the power of the nearness of the event. The whole place was rapt, ‘jacks forgotten, fights discarded, the Sheep Drop of no importance now.\n\nHe walked into the taproom, quiet like. We all moved as he approached the trestle. Squint was behind the bar, as quiet as the rest of us and when the Speaker approached him, he did something I never thought I’d see, not from ol’ Squint.\n\nHe bowed to the man.\n\nOne meaty arm laid across his blubbering gut and one upturned hammy fist laid to his forehead. He leaned at the waist, his eyes seeking his feet, and he spoke in the Uu’uschlek, the holy cant of the Temple of Wrath. I found out later what he said in plain old Common, and it chilled me to hear it. He said, in the most deferential tone I ever heard fatass Squint utter in his entire, wretched existence, he said simply, “We the unknowing seek wisdom. Will you share it?”\n\nAt these words the Speaker returned, in Common, “I will. But may I have a ‘jack of Dox, first?”\n\nThis break in the ritual jolted the room. Laughter erupted, it splashed and rolled, and washed the room in a warm feeling I forgot existed, and for a moment I lived another life, in another place and these huge fuckers were all my best mates, celebrating the wonder of the Truth made real and suddenly the Dox was in the Speaker’s gut and he began to Speak and the laughter stopped as it if had never existed and the shadows and the weight of the heavy, dark timbers fell upon me, and the speaker’s voice had the same shade and mass, a heavy, rolling thing, suitable for the size of the man, who looked now, in the grimy light, like he had crawled out of some hellish place dreamt up by the Black Hand – those murderous priests of Abohar the Devourer.\n\nHis clothes were all torn up, and I could see was wounded, the cuts and rips suddenly standing out all over his body and I surmised that he had been attacked by a pack of very well-trained swordsmen, duelers no doubt, to be able to inflict so many wounds and yet still let their victim live. But as he spoke of his Wrongdoing – the sacred path of the betrayed – my mind wandered away from his words and I considered his demeanor as a whole.\n\nHe was young, but not youthful, perhaps 35 or 40 years old, and not unhandsome, but cursed with a farmer’s face, slim and sinewy. He was very tall, nearly 7 feet by my guess and lanky as all get out. But he did not look stupid or awkward, no, but there was no way to know if he was truly strong, for the Telling had a power of its own, but then the man was out of the Wrongdoing, and I caught some of it, a lover jilted and robbery gone bad, the reason was unimportant, and suddenly the room was a-hush again, all ears on the Tale…\n\n…and the speaker said, “So after I discovered where the rat and the little whore were hiding and I had to ask the Dame Mistress for a key to the Under, and she said yeah, but I had to give three people the hex, and I said I didn’t want to and she said if I wanted to enter the Under without her permission, then I should just go ahead and start running now.\n\nSo I said “ok, ok” and I asked for the papers, but she said after, and I left, and headed straight across West Muckamuck until I neared the Dome. I paid the waterskell for the ride and soon found the pipe that would take me into the Under, and Gods, yeah I was scared to go down there, whole city of sewers down there, filled with the worst, the worst there is, we all heard the stories since we were kids, the were-vermin and living spells run amok, cannibal gangs of diseases, snot-toughs, and howling packs of dungspawn. Hell yeah I was scared, but I didn’t even wait, I just dropped inside, had to squirm most of the way, but when I finally dropped into the Under the dark was full of them big rats, the squealers. They jumped up on me pretty good until I remembered the sword and my torch. Guess I learned to keep thinking. To remember why I was in this shitty pipe in the middle of the night.”\n\nAt this, the crowd, myself included, murmured, “Purpose revealed” in one single voice.\n\nHe continued, “I hadda crouch the whole time, fighting squealers the whole way, a few bats bolted past my head, and the torch kept threatening to go out, the wind was terrible, I didn’t know there’d be wind, but with all the holes in the Under, it wasn’t too surprising when you thought about it. The breeze stank like rotten bodies, and it was cold, the wind, really cold.\n\nSoon the pipe opened out into a five-way junction, one of the ways was straight up, but the surface substructure, the piss and water pipes, I mean, was destroyed during the Third City War, and the end was completely blocked, there was no way to get out in a hurry, if I needed it.”\n\n“I knew this place. It was the place I was looking for, knowing it wasn’t like every other five-way junction in the whole rotting Under because of the painted sigil of the Betrayed. Like an organic stain, it was, the Wroth-Fingered Fist of Umbruk-the-Thorn, Lord and Master of the Wronged, and a puckered and flickering bubble of arcane magicks around the graffito sparked and buzzed with his fell power. “\n\n“I have already told you of my Wrongdoing, but I will remind you of the name of my benefactor, Mister Dagus Marsh, who told me of the junction, and the sigil, and now here it was, good as promised.\n\nAccording to Dagus, the treacherous bitch and that man were holed up in a tunnel to the west, some 2000 yards in a small antechamber. They were being helped by someone in East Muckamuck, Dagus said, someone connected to the self-styled king of the East Muck’ers, I won’t say his name, but we all know who I’m talking about, and if any of his men are in here, well…well I won’t say I’m sorry, because I’m not, but I sure am glad you boys are here to hear this. It’s gotta kicker of an ending.”\n\nThe Speaker coughed and rubbed his nose. His eyes were shining with the power of the Telling. We were getting to the thick of it now, it was close, and we all could feel it, like a fishhook in our minds, lured with a whispering promise, to feed the truth inside each of us here. The truth of Vengeance applied with a divine purpose and a clear mind. Its simple overwhelming power.\n\nHe continued, “All I had to do was to go down the west tunnel. Simple. Too bad I was born a Schlegel. That’s my pa’s name. I got his luck too, I guess. But in the end, I was aided by the Hand of Vengeance, and my prayers were fulfilled.”\n\nThe room mouthed, as one, “Wroth leads, through sacrifice, to redemption.”\n\n“I went down the way I thought was west, but I passed through a four way and then as I came into another one I saw the other three tunnels were mostly blocked, packed up with debris and rocks. I thought maybe Dagus had forgotten to mention it, but then I remembered that he never forgot to mention anything and by the time I turned around started back a small tremor rocked the ground and a heavy grate crashed down over the way I had gone.”\n\n“Then I heard the noise. Rats. Sounded like hundreds of them. Maybe thousands of them.\n\nI know I pissed myself cause I could smell it, even in that black pit. The smell of warm piss and the alien organic sound of the swarm rising and rising in that hellish place. Coming for me.”\n\n“They swarmed into chamber from everywhere, like the room had just reached critical mass and boiled over with rat. They were like a fecal wave of squealing, gnashing teeth with a haze of filthy parasites a-swarm above it. I could hear the buzzing of the flies and mosquitoes fill the room before they began to bat against my face and I knew that I would suffocate as well as be torn to pieces and I knew at that moment I shrieked and shrieked and wept and prayed.\n\nYes I prayed, to the almighty Wroth Lord, Umbruk-of-the-Thorn, The Redeemer, yes, I prayed, a fervent, desperate prayer, I promised him anything, I pledged myself, declared myself his pawn, his ever-humble servant for eternity if he would just grant me this, the strength to survive this and exact my rightful vengeance against that hateful bitch and the fucker who destroyed my whole life.”\n\n“I remembered the look on Jay’la’s face and the way she sneered her mouth when she told me what she done and that man stepped out from behind the door. They both laughed, and when I remembered that feeling, the feeling that I had at that moment, something happened. Something…”\n\nThe Moment had come. The reason we had all gathered there. Junkies and their fix of justice.\n\nThe Speaker licked his dry lips again, a grey thing that didn’t look real when it slipped back into his mouth, and the skin around his mouth was dry and parched looking too, and since I was in the Listening, I was dry too, ya know? I remember wanting that Dox again, wishing I could have just one perfumed drop to relieve some of the sucking agony of my parched, dry, dusty ol’ gob.\n\nThen He swallowed, and continued, his voice like the scrape of stone in a desiccated tomb to some ancient god, “When they were on me so thick I could not feel myself anymore, when I was just a wriggling mass under the sea of rats, I felt myself, my mind, grow still.\n\nI remembered the look on Jay’la’s face. I remembered her laugh. I remembered the discovery of my life’s work destroyed, my life’s savings stolen. I remembered the words to my wife and her spitting in my face and that man stepping out from behind the door, and my beaten and bloodied son in his arms and Jay’la’s laugh again and her saying Tutob wasn’t my son and her laughing again. I remember the look in that man’s eyes, and the fear in my son’s, who wasn’t anymore, but still was, and the look in my son’s face, and the sick churning cold in my gut as I ran from the Watch the she-devil had paid off to make sure I cleared off or got dead quick.”\n\n“I felt the cold thing in my stomach blossom and multiply, filling me, filling my mind with pure rage.\n\nI knew that the Jagged Fist Himself had laid his hand upon me; the righteous anger of His Work filled me with such cold, patient soothing, that I suddenly lost all fear of the swarm devouring my body, and I knew what I had to do. I had to become what I could not fight.\n\nMy hands curled into claws and I felt myself become something very old, something forgotten, and I fought and bit and ripped and stomped and hurled myself about that wet, stinking chamber killing rats in the dozens and drinking their blood as they drank mine. I showed them what rodent hunger would never understand about human hunger. The insect cloud showed its true colors, centering their swarm on me, covered in food, as I was, and for a time I forgot myself and was a beast. I had only one thought. One sound. One image. I would be revenged.”\n\nWell. We was all awake, now, ya know? Feeling the burn of the Telling, feeling the same shame and hot anger that the Speaker had felt, and the sweat rolled down our faces, and our guts churned with the Remembrance, but we all silently urged him on, knowing the payoff was coming, and some even forgot themselves and shouted into the sweaty, close confines, “Strength to the Wronged!” or “Umbruk’s Will!”, but the Speaker, he rolled on, his eyes wide and bright, his face flushed and as sweaty as the rest of ours were, his towering frame swayed on adrenaline-jittery legs, and the Speaker continued, “I don’t know how long I was there, it didn’t feel very long, but I don’t know. Hours, maybe.\"\n\n“I still felt the Hand of the Wrothful upon me. I knew my body was ravaged and bloody. I knew that my belly was full of meat and it made me feel strong. Centered. I knew something else. I knew where the evil bitch was. Where she was exactly. I hadn’t missed her hidey-hole by much, but it would be a bit of a walk. I just had to get out of the dead-rat hole. The grate was old and I don’t think it was a trap. It was just really bad timing and bad luck for me. I grabbed a hold of it and knew that I wouldn’t be able to lift it had the Hand not been with me. With the Wrothlord’s blessed aid I lifted the grate as easy as I lifted that ‘jack of Dox earlier, and I was out of that butcher’s hole. It stank of death and blood. It was a sacred place. The place of my rebirth.”\n\n“Like I said, I knew where Jay’la and her fuckman were hiding. The Hand showed me the way. I backtracked to the original five-way with the sigil and made the correct turn. My body and mind were full of the Fury, and I promised the Master that I would give him many lives if he would not desert me now. I would exact such a toll upon his enemies that Cyric, the Death Lord Himself, would not be able to keep up.”\n\n“I soon found the right door. It was locked and barred, but my Fury was such that I battered the door off its frame. No one would be coming. Not in the Under. Not with the Fury of Umbruk upon me.”\n\nA hushed, “the Power of the Jagged Fist” rippled across the crowd.\n\n“The bitch and her man had been rutting. It stank with their drippings. I was beyond feelings or words. I strangled the bastard first, even as he pummeled me and the bitch chewed my legs. I crushed his throat and watched the light die in his eyes before I dropped him. The treacherous bitch had done a runner, but again, by the blessed grace of His Wroth I knew exactly where she was, running through the bad places in the Under, and I pursued. With glee”\n\nHe stopped here, and looked to Squint and did something no other Speaker had ever done.\n\nHe asked for a leatherjack of Dox. He even walked over and got it from the trestle after Squint had suddenly come out of the Listening and ran, ran, over to the taps, spilling a bit of it as he joggled his fat ass back quick to hand it to the Speaker, Squint’s eyes glazed over and slightly demented looking, as if he had just woken from a dream.\n\nVery quickly, one by one, we came out of the Listening. Some were confused and angry. I’ve heard tale of Listeners who stay trapped in the Tale, unable to think or talk about anything else if the Tale has been interrupted and not completed. It’s a dangerous thing, a story, dontcha think? Anything can happen. Not to be just interrupted like that. Can really screw yer head up, ya know?\n\nThe Speaker sculled the ‘jack,1,2,3 and turned to face the crowd, who buzzed, annoyed, and one chuzza sang out, “Oy! What the fuck is all this then?”, but the Speaker was talking again and he said,\n\n“I caught her and made her understand how badly she had hurt me. After it was over, after I was done and my mouth was full of meat and bone, after I accepted her apology, I saw one.\n\nOne of the Revenged.”\n\nThe room dropped to a quiet still again. The Listening instantly washed over us, as if we had never been disturbed.\n\n“It was in the tunnel outside this dead end I had cornered Jay’la in. I turned my head and it was there, and I can’t, I can’t tell you what, what it looked like, because …well … I just can’t describe it. It was wroth, do you understand? It was wroth.”\n\nThe Speaker’s eyes filled with tears when he said this. Tears. Covered in blood and meat and he was weeping and dripping snot everywhere, just babbling, ya know? “Wroth, wroth, you can’t understand, you can’t understand, the horror of its beauty, the horror, like scissors in my mind.”\n\nHe went on like that for a few minutes I think, I’m not sure, the Listening has its own power and time isn’t always a sure thing. Crying and trying to explain what one of His Revenged looked like and not being able to, ya know? At the time we were all caught up in the Listening and didn’t really understand the full impact of what he was saying.\n\nThen the Speaker gathered himself, wiped his face and said, “It voice filled my mind like scissors cutting out parts of me and putting in new thoughts, new ideas, new understandings. It destroyed me and made me whole again.”\n\nAnd he smiled. Real big. Blood and scraps of meat clung to his raggedy teeth. He mugged at us the way you would a stupid mutt right before you booted him in the bollocks for being a bastard.\n\nAgain, we started coming out of the Listening, faster this time, and in groups, and there was real anger this time, and a few of the men took a step or two towards him, ready to kick his teeth in, Speaker or not, when we heard the sound.\n\nThe alien, organic sound of a rat swarm coming up from some ragged hole in the city’s understructure.",
