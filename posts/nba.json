Be truthful and honest and authentic about how difficult the NBA is in the sense of decisions that are made and the business side of it. But also, he has a personal touch that you trust.\u201d\n\nEvery great organization, in sports or elsewhere, has at least one executive who specializes in greasing sticky relationships, someone equally skilled at handling issues delicate or trivial. An arbitrator\/advisor\/counselor. For the Warriors, that person is Myers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t ever take that for granted,\u201d Curry said. \u201cThe fact that I can have a difficult conversation with him. I can pick up the phone and let him know how I\u2019m feeling. He\u2019ll give it to me straight around where we are as a team or where I am individually.\u201d\n\nIt was Myers who in 2017 advised CEO Joe Lacob not to bother negotiating a new contract with Curry\u2019s agent, Jeff Austin, because Steph was a two-time MVP and two-time NBA champion whose value was not in question. When Curry became eligible for a \u201csupermax\u201d contract in 2021, he was one of the league\u2019s top three players. Again, no need for negotiation.\n\nMyers\u2019 presence was significant in decisions by former players Shaun Livingston and Zaza Pachulia to accept front office positions with the franchise after retiring. It is a factor in Klay Thompson saying he wants to be a \u201cWarrior for life.\u201d\n\nIf Draymond Green decides to opt into the final year of his contract, Myers will be one of the reasons.\n\n\u201cBob is huge for us,\u201d Green told NBC Sports Bay Area. \u201cSome GMs put a team together and then they go into their office and watch to see if it works.

But he only won a championship in 1971. Wilt Chamberlain is next from 1961-64, but he didn't win any championships during that three year period. \n\nIn third we have George Mikan from 1948-51, *and* he won two championships in those three years. And after Mikan we have Michael Jordan from 1987-1990, with no championships, or from 1988-1991, with slightly lower stats but one championship.\n\nStatistically, according to Win Shares, no one else is even in the discussion. Bill Russell and Michael Jordan both threepeated multiple times, but their Win Shares were not comparable.\n\n[https:\/\/www.basketball-reference.com\/leaders\/ws\\_season.html](https:\/\/www.basketball-reference.com\/leaders\/ws_season.html)\n\nBecause of Mikan's combination of stats and championships from 1948-51, one might argue that it's the best three year peak in NBA history. Of course it was a different time and the league was in its infancy. But when comparing players from different eras we usually compare how dominant they were at the time, and don't try to speculate about how dominant they would be today.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Mikan was so dominant that he prompted several significant rule changes in the NBA, including the introduction of the goaltending rule, the widening of the foul lane \u2014 known as the \"Mikan Rule\" \u2014 and the creation of the shot clock.\n\nAnd, as a funny side note, Mikan was also indirectly responsible for the introduction of the three point line into the NBA. As the first commissioner of the ABA he adopted the three point line in that league, and it was added in the NBA after the merger with the ABA.\n\nAnyway, when discussing the greatest peaks in NBA history, don't forget George Mikan. He should at least be in the conversation.","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678804892.0},{"title":"How many bad teams would you need to combine in order to win an NBA title? A look down the hypothetical rabbit hole","author":"ZandrickEllison","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nba\/comments\/11qcyz0\/how_many_bad_teams_would_you_need_to_combine_in\/","text":"As the title implies, our exercise here will be determining how many \"bad teams\" (the ones with the worst records) you would need to [combine](https:\/\/rocketswire.usatoday.com\/2020\/10\/28\/mavs-coach-rick-carlisle-on-stephen-silas-great-hire-for-rockets\/) in order to contend for and ultimately win an NBA title.\n\nIt's not going to be as easy you'd expect. After all, the bad teams are littered with young lottery picks. And while those players have bright futures, even the best rookies tend to be average or below-average starters out of the gates. In theory, our depth will explode quickly, but that'd be more helpful in the regular season than the playoffs where your rotation shrinks down to 8-9. Having a strong 14th or 15th man will only help us so much.\n\nWith that in mind, let's go team by team to see how many it'll take.\n\n---\n\n**ONE TEAM: DETROIT**\n\n**key additions**: The Pistons currently have the worst record in the NBA at 15-53. Worse yet, Cade Cunningham is lost for the season and probably wouldn't be available to us. Alternatively, I'd expect that veteran sniper Bojan Bogdanovic (currently not playing) *would* be able to suit up if we needed him. Critics weren't sure why a tanking team traded for Bogdanovic in the first place -- but clearly GM Troy Weaver and coach Dwane Casey knew this post was coming.\n\n**our lineup**\n\nPG:  Jaden Ivey (DET)\n\nSG:  Alec Burks (DET)\n\nSF:  Bojan Bogdanovic (DET)\n\nPF:  Marvin Bagley III (DET)\n\nC:  Jalen Duren (DET)\n\n**rotation**: Isaiah Stewart (DET), Cory Joseph (DET), James Wiseman (DET)\n\n**our chances**: Rookie Jaden Ivey has been coming on late in the year and can take the reins to our offense. That said, Ivey (still only 21) would probably be used as a Tasmanian devil off the bench for an actual playoff team. We'd get a slight boost by virtue of *trying* to win (and not over-playing youngsters like Killian Hayes), but this would still be a 20\/25 win team. We need more help, stat!\n\n---\n\n**TWO TEAMS: Detroit + HOUSTON**\n\n**key additions**: The Rockets have some good young talent, but they're erratic right now. We can add Jalen Green and Alperen Sengun as key pieces, but again, they're a few years away from being bedrock playoff performers.\n\n**our lineup**\n\nPG:  Jaden Ivey (DET)\n\nSG:  Jalen Green (HOU)\n\nSF:  Alec Burks (DET)\n\nPF:  Bojan Bogdanovic (DET)\n\nC:  Alperen Sengun (HOU)\n\n**rotation**: Marvin Bagley III (DET), Jalen Duren (DET), Jabari Smith (HOU), Tari Eason (HOU)\n\n**our chances**: This team would be *fun*, but would struggle mightily on the defensive end. Overall, I'm still thinking we're topping out around 25\/30 wins. Hopefully we'll get a few more veterans next time.\n\n---\n\n**THREE TEAMS: Detroit + Houston + SAN ANTONIO**\n\n**key additions**: It's a shame that the Spurs traded away Jakob Poeltl because we could have used his rim protection. Still, they're offering us some welcome help at the wings in the form of Devin Vassell and Keldon Johnson.  Rookie Jeremy Sochan may have more long-term upside, but Vassell (year 3) and Johnson (year 4) are more developed right now. In fact, they're jumping into the starting lineup to help steady the ship.\n\n**our lineup**\n\nPG:  Jaden Ivey (DET)\n\nSG:  Devin Vassell (SA)\n\nSF:  Keldon Johnson (SA)\n\nPF:  Bojan Bogdanovic (DET)\n\nC:  Alperen Sengun (HOU)\n\n**rotation**: Jalen Green (HOU), Alec Burks (DET), Jalen Duren (DET), Jabari Smith (HOU)\n\n**our chances**: In addition to the wings, we'd benefit by adding Gregg Popovich to the coaching staff. The Hall of Fame could have our team playing more organized, smarter basketball. But even still, Coach Pop can't conjure up a scheme to help us get stops inside. Our 3-team team will end up around 40 wins.\n\n---\n\n**FOUR TEAMS: Detroit + Houston + San Antonio + CHARLOTTE**\n\n**key additions**: It's been a nightmare season for Charlotte from start to finish, but they do have some proven players for us to bring into the building. PG LaMelo Ball will give us a go-to player (and move Jaden Ivey to the bench). Additionally, SG Terry Rozier, SF Gordon Hayward, and PF P.J. Washington could all start for most teams in the league. Our depth is going to take a major boost right now; we'll have the best bench in the league.\n\n**our lineup**\n\nPG:  LaMelo Ball (CHA)\n\nSG:  Devin Vassell (SA)\n\nSF:  Keldon Johnson (SA)\n\nPF:  Gordon Hayward (CHA)\n\nC:  Alperen Sengun (HOU)\n\n**rotation**: Bojan Bogdanovic (DET), Terry Rozier (CHA), Jalen Green (HOU), Jaden Ivey (DET), P.J. Washington (CHA)\n\n**our chances**: Our new-found balance and depth is going to push us into the playoffs for the first time. We finish around 45 wins, and would give ourselves a puncher's chance to win a round. Still, we're lacking the top-end talent of most title teams so we can't taste gold yet.\n\n---\n\n**FIVE TEAMS: Detroit + Houston + San Antonio + Charlotte + ORLANDO**\n\n**key additions**: As mentioned, rookies and sophomores aren't usually \"winning\" players. Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner may be the exception. Wagner is an easy \"plug and play\" -- and capable of soaking up minutes at multiple positions. We're also going to presume that Banchero's mediocre efficiency comes from being the go-to guy on a bad team. His dynamic offense will move Gordon Hayward to the bench. At center, we're going to tap Wendell Carter Jr. to replace Alperen Sengun because we need some help defensively. Overall, that'll give us three starters from the Magic.\n\n**our lineup**\n\nPG:  LaMelo Ball (CHA)\n\nSG:  Franz Wagner (ORL)\n\nSF:  Keldon Johnson (SA)\n\nPF:  Paolo Banchero (ORL)\n\nC:  Wendell Carter Jr. (ORL)\n\n**rotation**: Gordon Hayward (CHA), Bojan Bogdanovic (DET), Devin Vassell (SA), Terry Rozier (CHA), Alperen Sengun (HOU)\n\n**our chances**: Our depth looks awesome -- and would help propel us to 50 wins in the regular season. Still, we're going to be \"young\" in regards to our top scorers like LaMelo Ball and Paolo Banchero, which usually doesn't bode well in the playoffs. Our team loses in Round Two.\n\n---\n\n**SIX TEAMS: Detroit + Houston + San Antonio + Charlotte + Orlando + INDIANA**\n\n**key additions**: We needed more steady play and more rim protection, making Indiana a welcome sight for us here. Tyrese Haliburton's passing and basketball IQ will help mold the team together, and Myles Turner's rim protection will be a major boon to us.\n\n**our lineup**\n\nPG:  LaMelo Ball (CHA)\n\nSG:  Tyrese Haliburton (IND)\n\nSF:  Keldon Johnson (SA)\n\nPF:  Paolo Banchero (ORL)\n\nC:  Myles Turner (IND)\n\n**rotation**: Gordon Hayward (CHA), Franz Wagner (ORL), Bojan Bogdanovic (DET), Devin Vassell (SA), Terry Rozier (CHA)\n\n**our chances**: We're long. We're strong. We have unbelievable depth. This is the first version where we can confidently say that we're contending for a championship. In fact, with Gregg Popovich at the helm, I'm going to give us the nod and say that we finally accomplished our goal. Normally a playoff team would have a small rotation, but using 10+ guys may help us overwhelm the competition.\n\nIf there's a knock against this team, it's a matter of top-end talent. It's hard to say any of these guys are top 15 players in the league. If you think we need more high-end superstars, then maybe you think we need to add another team (as Portland and Damian Lillard would be on deck).\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR**: According to my calculations (and I use that word loosely), we'd need to combine SIX teams in order to win a title.

Here's the video of the play: [https:\/\/streamable.com\/tpcxjp](https:\/\/streamable.com\/tpcxjp). I really think this play potentially changed the landscape of the NBA situation today through a wild butterfly effect. I know it sounds wild but hear me out. \n\nThis was game 67\/72 for both teams and they were in a dogfight for the 6th seed. At this point in the game, the Blazers are up by 3, but the Lakers have all the momentum and Anthony Davis is going beserk with 36 points and 12 rebounds, including a clutch block. \n\nAll of a sudden, Kuzma takes an incredibly quick three while already being 2-10 from the field, and bricks it. Portland essentially secures the 6th seed and the Lakers have to enter the play-in only to play a really talented Suns team in the first round, while Portland got the privilege to play a team that started a backcourt of Facu Campazzo and Austin Rivers.\n\nIn this potential butterfly effect, lets say the momentum carries. The Lakers get great shots and win the pivotal game on the road. When LeBron comes back the Lakers gain that 6th seed they desperately coveted. Regardless if AD gets hurt or not like he did in the Suns series, I feel that they beat the undermanned Nuggets team.\n\nPerhaps if the Lakers made the 2nd round instead of being a 1st round exit, they don't sacrifice their cap space and picks for an aging costly Westbrook who was never a great fit, and perhaps play their cards smarter in the offseason and actually appear as contenders in 2021-22?\n\nYou guys tell me! What other fun butterfly effect hypotheticals do you also enjoy revisiting that might not be talked about much?","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678702413.0},{"title":"[Wind] Christian Braun was +9 in 12 4th quarter minutes.

Starting the 70's, it was all about adidas as about 70% or 80% of NBA players were wearing either mostly adidas superstars or the super grip and pro model. The other notable 70's shoes worn by players were the converse pro leather, Nike blazer, and puma suede. The 80's had much more variety as converse made a comeback with weapons.

For PGs exclusively, it was 54.4%. So he was 0.2% better than league average and exactly 1% better than his position average.\n\nAI: 31.1ppg on 51.8% true shooting, with a league average of 51.8%. For SGs it was 52.7%. He had dead league average efficiency and slightly under 1% less efficient compared to his position.\n\nSo marginal difference between AI and Russ, neither were particularly efficient at their peak.\n\n**Stats Per 36**\n\nWestbrook: 32.9ppg\n\nAI: 26.7ppg\n\nObviously, the fact that Iverson was so durable should be recognized within itself, but it should also be recognized how this would inflate his scoring averages. Westbrook accomplished roughly as much in 8 less minutes, with Westbrook averaging 34.6 minutes in 2017 and AI averaging 42 minutes in 2001, which is 21.3% more minutes per game.\n\nIf Westbrook was averaging 42 minutes per game he would have averaged 38.3ppg -- assuming his stamina didn't take a significant hit and he could continue scoring at the same production (which I recognize is unlikely). Or alternatively, if AI averaged 34.6 minutes per game, he would have a 25.6ppg average.\n\n**Scoring Inflation**\n\nWestbrook: 31.6ppg out of a league average team score of 105.6ppg. So he was good for 29.9% of the league average point total, and 29.6% of just the Thunder's (who averaged 106.6 that season).\n\nAI: 31.1ppg out of a league average team score of 94.8, which is good for 32.8%. For just Philly, it was also 32.8% (who averaged only 0.1 point less than league average).\n\nAI has a slight advantage here, but again you would have to consider AI's inflated minute average. In per 36, Russ would have averaged 36.2% of an average team box score if he played the same minutes as AI. Or alternatively, AI would have averaged 27% if he played the same minutes as Westbrook.\n\n**Scoring Accolades**\n\nWestbrook: 2 scoring titles. Context is needed here, Russ was the 1st (or only) scoring option in 2015 and 2017, when KD was injured and when KD left. After, he had Paul George and Harden both being the primary scorers (Harden won the scoring title in 2020 and PG was the runner-up in 2019). In every other season of his career in his prime, he had another capable or elite scorer on his squad.\n\nAI: 4 scoring titles. And to be fair, he averaged 33ppg in 2005-06 behind a legendary scoring season by Kobe. But context is also needed here, he was the main scorer on all of his 76ers squads,  it is easier to retain high scoring numbers when your 2nd highest scorer is averaging 15 and under, opposed to sharing the load with people competing for the scoring title like KD, Paul George and Harden. When AI was put next to another elite scorer in Melo, his scoring numbers deflated similar to what you saw in Russ's 2010-11 NBA season (his 3rd year) when he was behind young KD, both averaging almost 23ppg per 36, on roughly the same league average game score, on similar efficiency numbers.\n\n**EDIT:** Just for fun, I'll add 2015 Russ as well: 28.1ppg on 53.6% true shooting, 0.2% better than league average (53.4) and 1.1% better than his position (52.5). This is in 34.4 mpg, in a league where the average team score was 100. Meaning, Westbrook was responsible for 28.1% of the league average point total, and 27% for OKC specifically (who had 104 ppg). This is slightly better efficiency than peak scoring AI (05-06), and if AI's minutes were reduced to 34.4 like Russ's, he'd average 26.3ppg, or if Russ's minutes increased to 43.1, he'd average 33.7ppg.\n\n05-06 AI was responsible for 34% of league average point total (97), or 33% of the Sixers (who averaged 2 more ppg than league average). If the minutes were adjusted to be more inline with 2015 Russ, he'd be responsible for 27% of the league average point total, and 26% of the Sixers score total, similar if not slightly worse than Russ. If you increased Russ's output to match Iverson's average mpg, he'd be responsible for 33.7% of the league average scoring total or 32.4% of OKC's. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;","upvote_ratio":0.2,"created_utc":1678782690.0},{"title":"best possible playoff matchups? suns vs mavs, warriors vs grizz, who else?","author":"phuzul","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nba\/comments\/11pllkt\/best_possible_playoff_matchups_suns_vs_mavs\/","text":"in an ideal world what are your favorite possible playoff match ups, maximizing rivalries and entertainment, put your fav team aside and think about the most fun matchup\n\nKD and Book vs Kyrie and Luka for the most awkward(for KD and Kyrie at least) yet contentious beef in recent memory\n\ndraymond vs dillon brooks in the fight for the most unlikeable player\n\nceltics heat just so it can go to game 7 again?\n\nwhat other combos can y'all think of?","upvote_ratio":0.79,"created_utc":1678645248.0},{"title":"Who is the Third Greatest Scoring Shooting Guard in NBA History?","author":"Commercial-Dingo-629","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nba\/comments\/11q3t04\/who_is_the_third_greatest_scoring_shooting_guard\/","text":"As basketball fans, we all know that Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant are two of the greatest scoring shooting guards of all time. ***But who comes in at number three?***\n\nLet's take a closer look at the careers and statistics of four of the most prolific scoring shooting guards in NBA history: Dwyane Wade, Allen Iverson, James Harden, and Jerry West.\n\n**Dwyane Wade:**\n\n* 3x NBA Champion\n* 13x NBA All-Star\n* 8x All-NBA Selection\n* NBA Finals MVP (2006)\n* Career PPG: 22.0\n* Career FG%: 48.6%\n* Career 3P%: 29.7%\n* Career FT%: 76.6%\n\n**Allen Iverson:**\n\n* NBA MVP (2001)\n* 11x NBA All-Star\n* 7x All-NBA Selection\n* NBA Rookie of the Year (1997)\n* Career PPG: 26.7\n* Career FG%: 42.5%\n* Career 3P%: 31.3%\n* Career FT%: 78.0%\n\n**James Harden:**\n\n* NBA MVP (2018)\n* 9x NBA All-Star\n* 6x All-NBA Selection\n* Career PPG: 25.1\n* Career FG%: 44.3%\n* Career 3P%: 36.3%\n* Career FT%: 85.8%\n\n**Jerry West:**\n\n* NBA Champion\n* 14x NBA All-Star\n* 10x All-NBA Selection\n* NBA Finals MVP (1969)\n* Career PPG: 27.0\n* Career FG%: 47.4%\n* Career 3P%: N\/A\n* Career FT%: 81.4%\n\nSo, who do you think is the third greatest scoring shooting guard in NBA history?","upvote_ratio":0.53,"created_utc":1678695101.0},{"title":"Grizzlies rookie David Roddy in a comeback win against Dallas: 24 points, 17 of them in the 4th quarter, 10-13 from the field and 4-7 from 3","author":"BoisterousBrigand","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nba\/comments\/11p4ojj\/grizzlies_rookie_david_roddy_in_a_comeback_win\/","text":"Throw in 4 rebounds, 2 steals and a block.

The average player's statistical prime is 23 - 28.\n* Embiid plays in an era where there are more points\/minute than in the last 30 years or so.\n\nIf we want to compare points per minute in a more fair way, we'd need to only take seasons for players between the age of 22 - 28 (Embiid's NBA career), then normalize it by league average points\/minute.\n\nTo give you an example, Kobe's points\/minute in his prime year (05\/06) was 0.86. His last year playing was only 0.62.\n\nIn Kobe's prime year, 05\/06, teams averaged 2.02 points per minute. This year, teams are averaging 2.38 per minute or 18% more points per minute.\n\n**If you extrapolate Kobe's 05\/06 numbers into 2023 season, his points\/minute would be 1.0148\/minute, which is 6.8% better than Embiid's 0.95 this year.**\n\nThat said, Embiid is still clearly a very elite scorer and his scoring is historically good. Just want to put some context into the data.\n\nPS. If you're wondering, Jordan scored 0.9275\/minute in his infamous 37ppg season when teams averaged 2.28\/minute. If you extrapolate that number to 2023 season, it would be 0.968\/minute which is slightly better than Embiid but still 4.8% worse than Kobe's 05\/06. This is why some people say Kobe is the best scorer of all time and why Kobe's 05\/06 is considered as one of the greatest scoring seasons by an individual of all time.\n\n**tldr:** No if you understand basic math and logic. Yes if you don't.","upvote_ratio":0.37,"created_utc":1678771028.0},{"title":"[Tim MacMahon] Dillon Brooks hopes Kyrie Irving (foot\/personal reasons) plays tonight: \u201cNow I can get him by myself today, so I want to see what he\u2019s all about.

They can switch at the half to reduce the inside refs getting too gassed, as ostensibly they will be running more. \n\nWhen the ball is coming to their side, the outside ref can run baseline and away from the inside ref (toward the opposite sideline), that way both the inside and outside ref on this half court can see the baseline. The inside ref could still get to the baseline. Would this help foul and out of bounds calls?\n\nIn my opinion, the integrity of the game is pretty low right now. A few problems could be mitigated by this, I think, especially in the post season when all calls are more important. MLB employs more umpires during the post season to ensure all calls are true.\n\nOne problem I could see with this is that adding more referees might actually slow the game down more, with more possibility for human error from each ref.

To some guys, it\u2019s all about winning, and to some guys, it\u2019s all about just playing basketball.\u201d\n\n> On the morning of the Friday matchup, Thybulle described playing in Philadelphia as \u201cfear-based,\u201d which caused quite a stir amongst fans and apparently players too. \n\n>\u201dAny player that\u2019s playing out of a place of fear is going to struggle,\u201d he said. \u201cLike there\u2019s going to just be friction in everything you try to do. But when you play for a place of just discipline and receptiveness to what the game\u2019s giving and what you are reading from it. I think there\u2019s a lot more opportunity.\n\n>\u201dAnd for me, specifically, I feel like there was a lot more fear-based play in Philadelphia as opposed to what I\u2019m doing here in Portland.\u201d \n\n> \"Like I said, he was great when we had him here,\" Embiid finished. \"I wish him well. I still believe that he has a lot of potential. It\u2019s all about him putting the work in, especially shooting. And defensively, he\u2019s a monster.\u201d","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1678559418.0},{"title":"[Dunc\u2019d On Podcast] Sports media columnist Andrew Marchand on the NBA\u2019s TV landscape","author":"SqueakyRadish","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nba\/comments\/11pfkvt\/duncd_on_podcast_sports_media_columnist_andrew\/","text":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/episode\/546b3s52c12w8obkCw5WXQ?si=K55CaJ5lQBqTf5yE-zgBmg&app_destination=copy-link\n\nFirst hour or so is the discussion of the NBA\u2019s TV landscape\n\nBig takeaways: \n\n* The NBA is going to get a massive national TV deal coming up, despite lower ratings than past seasons \n\n* Local TV deals are going to potentially be up for grabs in the near future for 16 teams due to the bankruptcy of a company that owned Bally Sports (might be wrong on this detail)\n\n* Both Nate and Andrew agree that not only *should* the league should shorten the season but that it\u2019s also more than viable to do so. Obviously you\u2019d probably take a financial hit in the present, but there\u2019s huge potential to grow to an even healthier place within a reasonable time span\n\n* Andrew strongly believes that the regular season national TV broadcasting rights will be split up between at least 3 different broadcasters. Currently it\u2019s just ESPN and Turner (TNT). Andrew believes that ESPN will want fewer regular season games going forward and instead someone like Amazon will take a lot of their stake.

There's been a handful of players averaging close to or over 30ppg for most of the season, with  SGA being a consistent surprise all year. He just hasn't stopped.  The current top 6 have basically averaged over 30ppg  or very close to 30 every month, with the exception of Dame at around 22 and Tatum around 25 one month.  Crazy.  \n\nI grew up in the late 80s and 90s, and it was really only MJ who would hit or get close to 30ppg if memory serves.  Probably a few others scattered  in there, too, since then.  Kobe, Harden, maybe AI, maybe Shaq comes to mind.  But nothing that comes close to this season that I can recall.  I know the game has changed and is much quicker and a lot more shots going up and defense is more of an idea than a philosophy, so it makes sense, but still, has this happened before at any point in the history of professional basketball in the US?

For example, Jokic, Embiid, and Giannis (all people that create their own shot) always seem to have their TS% downplayed compared to Curry, for example. If Curry is shooting with the same efficiency as the bigs, Curry\u2019s is more impressive. I understand the argument Curry is taking tougher shots, but taking easier shots is itself a skill (if you\u2019re creating the easy shot).\n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m discussing guards and bigs who create their own shot, not Curry vs Capela or Curry vs Adams; they will have a high TS% but their shots are often made incredibly easy by their PGs not through their own skill.\n\nTo me, when comparing TS%, I think we should take into account how the defense defends you and if you are a shot creator, but not difficulty of shots\/where the shots are coming from or size.

Nikola Jokic is not a rim protector. (It is a crime -- a basketball crime, anyway -- to pretend as if Jokic has had less postseason success than Joel Embiid. Both have been centerpieces on undermanned teams which were dispatched in the first round -- Jokic last season against the eventual champions; Embiid in the bubble against the Boston Celtics with Ben Simmons out. Jokic has reached one conference final; Embiid has never been that far. Jokic's individual postseason numbers are better. None of this should matter in the MVP debate, but there appears to be a misconception in some corners that Jokic's lack of postseason success should be held against him relative to Embiid.)\n \nBest way to set up a post about Denver's defense is to immediately bring up Embiid and trash him too, keep the sixers fans at bay \n\n> The Nuggets try to scheme around that. Michael Malone has been much more creative varying up tactics -- zones, more conservative dropback coverages, having guards duck screens against so-so shooters, even stashing Jokic on nonthreatening wings. (This toggling was overdue.)\n\n> Jokic makes up for some of his limitations with steals, smart positioning, and sticky defensive rebounding. Denver's defense is much stingier with Jokic on the floor.\n\n> But Denver opponents have hit 71% at the rim -- the second-worst figure among all defenses. That is a lot about Jokic. The Nuggets have gotten somewhat lucky with opponent jump-shooting. Their model is an elite offense carrying a just-good-enough defense. They can win it all that way, but they may be more vulnerable than better defensive teams to the luck of matchups.\n\n> The Nuggets are more fundamentally sound on defense when they replace Porter with\u00a0Bruce Brown\u00a0alongside their other four starters; that is their closing lineup on lots of nights. But they are smaller, with less upside on offense.\n\n\nSource: https:\/\/www.espn.com\/nba\/insider\/story\/_\/id\/35820904\/flaw-undo-lakers-dame-career-scoring-run-preposterous-bol-bol article includes clips too for reference.

Something that raises eyebrows for sure is when people look at his DBPM, which is insanely high when compared to his actual play on the court. \n\nFor anyone unaware, the calculation for DBPM is:\n\nTotal BPM - Offensive BPM = DBPM\n\nThe calculation for VORP is: [BPM - (-2.0)] * (% of possessions played) * (team games\/82)\n\n[Here is where they explain all this stuff so you can read along if you want](https:\/\/www.basketball-reference.com\/about\/bpm2.html)\n\nThe most stand out part to me is the difference in value of PG assists and Center Assists.\n\nBPM runs on a player position estimation ranging from 1.0(PG) to 5.0(Center) and the difference between the value of assists when calculating BPM is 0.580 for PGs and 1.034 for Centers. The reasoning for this can be found in two separate paragraphs: \n\n\u201cAssists are worth far more for a post player than for a point guard. Point guards handle the ball a lot and usually generate lower value assists. A center\u2019s assists are usually very high value. In addition, post players that pass well are typically better defenders.\u201d\n\n\u201cAssists are interesting. For guards, the BPM and OBPM coefficients are similar. For bigs, though, the offensive value of assists is less than the total value. Assists are a significant indicator of defensive skill for bigs.\u201d\n\nWhy is this a big deal you ask? Because for calculating OBPM, assists are valued the same for both PGs and Centers, however DRebs negatively affect PGs at -0.112 while positively affecting Centers at .103\n\nWhat this leads to is Jokic having an insanely high BPM due to Center assists, and his OBPM is calculated high because of the value of the amount of DREBs he gets. And since his BPM is so ridiculously high, when you subtract his OBPM from his BPM, his DBPM is high as fuck as well. \n\n[Let\u2019s look at Jokics last MVP, his statistical best season of his career so far:](https:\/\/www.basketball-reference.com\/players\/j\/jokicni01.html)\n\nBPM: 13.7\n\nOBPM: 9.2\n\nDBPM:  4.5\n\nAccording to this stat, Jokic last year was better both on offense and defense to peak Michael Jordan\n\n[Here is 1987-1988 MJ stats:](https:\/\/www.basketball-reference.com\/players\/j\/jordami01.html)\n\nBPM: 13.0\n\nOBPM: 8.8\n\nDBPM: 4.2\n\n\nWhile Jokic was excellent last year, I don\u2019t see how this is any different compared to Westbrooks 2017 season, which causes the creator of BPM to update the stat because it clearly didn\u2019t pass the smell test, so why hasn\u2019t the stat been changed now to account for the overvalue of center assists? This also affects VORP as well because that stat is directly dependent on BPM. \n\nStats like RAPTOR and LEBROn can be talked about in another post, but those stats seem to favor an impactful player(s) on the court and then a shitty bench lineup on the court.

Nash usually does get brought up in the top 5 point guards ever discussion, but I\u2019m not sure if we\u2019ve ever properly given Nash the respect he deserves as an offensive great.\n\n\n\nJust going by his base level numbers, we can see that Nash is 2nd all time in free throw percentage, 7th all time in career assists per game average, 13th all time in career 3 point percentage, and top 25 all time in both offensive BPM and true shooting percentage. He holds the record for most seasons shooting 50\/40\/90 with 4, and he averaged 50\/40\/90 throughout his entire 10 year tenure with Phoenix. Obviously all that suggests he\u2019s one of the best offensive players ever even without being a volume scorer, but there\u2019s a little more digging to do.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBelow is a list of every Steve Nash led team\u2019s offensive ranking between the 2002-2010 seasons:\n\n\n\n2002 Mavs: 1st\n\n\n2003 Mavs: 1st\n\n\n2004 Mavs: 1st\n\n\n2005 Suns: 1st\n\n\n2006 Suns: 2nd\n\n\n2007 Suns: 1st\n\n\n2008 Suns: 2nd\n\n\n2009 Suns: 2nd\n\n\n2010 Suns: 1st\n\n\n\nAs far as I know, Steve Nash is the only player in league history to be the main initiator for 9 consecutive top 2 offenses. The closest player I could find to matching this is Magic Johnson, who did it 6 consecutive seasons with the Showtime Lakers.\n\n\nBelow is another list, this time of the teams with the best offenses in NBA history relative to the league (how many more points per 100 possessions a team scored above league average):\n\n\n\n2004 Mavs: +9.2\n\n\n2005 Suns: +8.4\n\n\n2016 Warriors: +8.1\n\n\n2002 Mavs: +7.7\n\n\n2010 Suns: +7.7\n\n\n1998 Jazz: +7.7\n\n\n1997 Bulls: +7.7\n\n\n1996 Bulls: +7.6\n\n\n2007 Suns: +7.4\n\n\n1988 Celtics: +7.4\n\n\n\nNotice a common denominator here? Steve Nash has been the engine of 5 of the 10 greatest offensive teams in NBA history relative to the league, including the top 2 offenses ever. This also means that it didn\u2019t matter the teammates that Steve Nash played with, he would always be the one constant as to why the team\u2019s offense was so great. In his first season in Phoenix, his fellow starters were Amar\u2019e Stoudemire, Joe Johnson, Shawn Marion, and Quentin Richardson. By 2010 when Nash was 35 years old, the roster had shifted to Jason Richardson, Grant Hill, and Channing Frye, with Amar\u2019e being the one constant. Phoenix finished with 2 of the best offenses in NBA history in both of those seasons. Nash didn\u2019t even need Amar\u2019e to lead a great offense, as he still led Phoenix to the league\u2019s 2nd best offense despite Amar\u2019e missing the entire season.\n\n\n\nNash should be considered one of the 5 greatest playmakers ever, one of the 10 greatest shooters ever, and hopefully I\u2019ve made the case well enough that he should be in strong consideration for at least one of the 10 greatest offensive players in NBA history.\u00a0","upvote_ratio":0.79,"created_utc":1678551129.0},{"title":"The Lakers bench outscored the Raptors bench 61-12 in the game.","author":"OmarBradley1940","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nba\/comments\/11ocds7\/the_lakers_bench_outscored_the_raptors_bench_6112\/","text":"Dennis Schroder: 23 pts\n\nAustin Reaves: 18 pts\n\nRui Hachimura: 16 pts\n\nWenyen Gabriel: 4 pts\n\n\nBench came up huge especially late.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1678514581.0},{"title":"GAME THREAD: Miami Heat (36-32) @ Orlando Magic (27-40) - (March 12, 2023)","author":"NBA_MOD","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nba\/comments\/11oxx5o\/game_thread_miami_heat_3632_orlando_magic_2740\/","text":"##General Information\n    **TIME**     |**MEDIA**                            |**Team Subreddits**        |\n    :------------|:------------------------------------|:-------------------|\n    07:00 PM Eastern |**Game Preview**: [NBA.com](https:\/\/www.nba.com\/game\/MIA-vs-ORL-0022201007\/preview) | \/r\/heat          |\n    06:00 PM Central |**Game Charts**: [NBA.com](https:\/\/www.nba.com\/game\/MIA-vs-ORL-0022201007\/game-charts) | \/r\/orlandomagic           |\n    05:00 PM Mountain|**Play By Play**: [NBA.com](https:\/\/www.nba.com\/game\/MIA-vs-ORL-0022201007\/play-by-play)|               |\n    04:00 PM Pacific |**Box Score**: [NBA.com](https:\/\/www.nba.com\/game\/MIA-vs-ORL-0022201007\/boxscore) |                 |\n   [Reddit Stream](https:\/\/reddit-stream.com\/comments\/auto) (You must click this link from the comment page.)","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678575600.0},{"title":"Who is the best under-25 wing in the NBA?","author":"VagabondReborn","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nba\/comments\/11op7jj\/who_is_the_best_under25_wing_in_the_nba\/","text":"The easy answer to this used to be Jayson Tatum, but he recently turned 25 so he's not eligible for this list anymore. \n\n\nIt feels like every great young player is a guard nowadays, or in Zion's case a PF.

Obviously there are many ways you could stat pad in an NBA game, but I'm focusing on guys making extra efforts to reach different milestones, like any multiple of 10 for points, or 10 rebounds\/assists. Guys hunting double\/triple doubles or big scoring nights. Why? Because that's easier to notice through looking at numbers and not watching hundreds of hours of footage. Hitting these numbers extra often suggests they are going out of their way to hit a number. It is entirely possible that some of the trends I see here are a coincidence, and I try to note that through four levels of stat padding, high, medium, low, and none.\n\nFor this analysis I looked at every game played by seven players, Jokic, Embiid, Giannis, LeBron, Russ, Luka, and Harden. Why these seven players? Three of them (Jokic, Embiid, Giannis) are the favorites for MVP so they're under scrutiny right now and the other four (LeBron, Russ, Luka, and Harden) are all top 10 all-time in triple doubles, so they have a lot of opportunities to stat pad. These are\/were all awesome players and I don't thing going out of your way to get an extra assists or make an extra shot really takes anything away from that greatness, I just wanted to see if I could spot some patterns. \n\nAlso, just to better explain what the chart below means I'll call out my guy Embiid. He clearly stat pads when it comes to assists, I have him listed as high. That doesn't mean that he's hunting assists every game though, he's hit double digit assists six times in his career, which is less than 2% of his games played, so he's rarely in the situation but when he is he's gunning for that 10 assist mark.\n\nSo first here's a stat padding summary and below I dive into each players charts:\n\n|Player|Points|Rebounds|Assists|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Nikola Jokic|None|Medium|High|\n|Joel Embiid|None|None|High|\n|Giannis Antetokounmpo|Low|None|None|\n|LeBron James|Low|None|None|\n|Russell Westbrook|Medium|None|Medium|\n|Luka Doncic|None|Low|High|\n|James Harden|Medium|Medium|None|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Jokic](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/4QzOtzW)\n\nPoints (N) - This graph is weird but nothing jumps out as stat padding, he scores 8, 23, and 35 points weirdly often but those aren't stat pad numbers.\n\nRebounds (M) - Here I would speculate he stat pads, the value 10 is his highest and it's a good bit higher than 9 and 11.\n\nAssists (H) - The number 10 shows a big spike, then there's a big drop off to 11 and another big drop off to 12. He's probably getting trying to get his 10th assist right before checking out and sometimes gets an 11th in the process.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Embiid](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/pm31jhv)\n\nPoints (N) - This looks similar to a normal bell curve with no stat pad spikes\n\nRebounds (N) - Weird drop off after 14 but that's not a stat pad number\n\nAssists (H) - I love the guy but he's no Jokic when it comes to assists, so he loves getting to double digit assists when he's close, he's definitely stat padding here. He has one game with 9 assists, one with 11, and five with 10. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Giannis](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/WCNBxv5)\n\nPoints (L) - There are some spikes at 30 points and 40 points but that could just be a coincidence.\n\nRebounds (N) - I know he literally just had a rebounding stat padding scandal but his most common rebounding number is 9, that's not stat padding behavior\n\nAssists (N) - Nothing out of the ordinary\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[LeBron](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/biaSGwX)\n\nPoints (L) - Had this listed as an N for a while until I looked more at the beginning and saw a spike at 10. He doesn't like being embarrassed by scoring single digits. However that almost never happens anyway and his other stat pad spots look completely fine.\n\nRebounds (N) - Nice looking bell curve\n\nAssists (N) - Same as above\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Russ](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/Ud3fcDe)\n\nPoints (M) - Like LeBron, he has a spike at 10 points, he also has another at 40.\n\nRebounds (N) - Looks fine\n\nAssists (M) - Judgment call here but I see a spike at 10 and a drop off at 12, seems like stat padding.

Which is exactly 30 days from now.\n\nSince a year is \\~365.25 days (every 4 years we add the February 29th, which wasn't this year - so 365 days), **so Brook Lopez will be 35 years & 8 days, and this will make him the oldest to receive the DPOY award.** Will also make him the oldest one to win DPOY for the first time.\n\nHe will also become the 12th NBA player to receive this award at the age of 30+.\n\nHe will be 4th Bucks player to receive this award, following Sidney Moncrief in the 1982-83 & 1983-84 seasons (The first & 2nd ever NBA player to receive it), and Giannis Antetokounmpo in the 2019-20 season.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI mostly remember Brook Lopez as an offensive player who likes to play with his back to the basket in the post, slow to defend despite his wide frame. \n\nI think it's been amazing how much has he improved & changed since (3PT range added too), especially when you consider that his defense was most famous for the poster [he got from Larry Nance Jr.](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5pqfvWthszA) until this transformation, including this [block on McGruder](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=NJmPgpxvni4) a few months later.\n\n[And last night, he had 24 points, 10 rebounds & 9 blocks vs. the same Nets he played for 9 seasons (New Jersey Nets & Brooklyn Nets).](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ABP10YTk4_g)\n\nOne thing is for sure: His twin brother, [Robin Lopez](https:\/\/www.basketball-reference.com\/players\/l\/lopezro01.html), who used to be considered the better defender of the two is now basically worse than Brook Lopez in almost every aspect except for the [mascot part](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RVrl72eys78) & maybe the [Robin Hook](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jiIlUWHAnOw).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you think Lopez will win the DPOY award?

If anything, adding a non-shooter like Jakob to the starting lineup while pushing Gary to the bench, irrespective of his current struggles coming off of the bench, has only exacerbated the issue with shooting and spacing in both the starting ad bench lineups.\n\nIf the Raptors wanted to make some noise in the playoffs, they needed to make a larger overall commitment to contending rather than just overpaying for Poeltl.","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1678523589.0},{"title":"O.G.

Jokic may be the best player in the league (according to the voters), but there is a strong argument that he is not the best *center*. Embiid is a much better defender than Jokic and scores much more points.

Bulls - Easily the best logo in the NBA and one of the most iconic jerseys in all of sports that is associated with the 90s dynasty and MJ\n\n2. Hornets - My sleeper team for this list, everything is fantastic with them. Dope colors, cool logo, the pinstripes are clean, and they have some of the coolest courts in the league\n\n3. Heat- Dope logo, probably #2 after Bulls for best logo to go on a lid. They've had some all time great jerseys in the last couple of years with the Miami vice look, their ransom note ones look like ass though. I hope it's for a good cause or some shit because they look bad\n\n4. Bucks - The only team IMO that genuinely improved their look with the rebranding trend in 2015-2017. The green looks better than their purple \n\n5. Celtics - Sucks with another green team and I debated Knicks\/Blazers but another classic look that has basically never changed throughout history. Their city ones are pretty meh though\n\nIf the Nuggets rolled with the rainbow jerseys like they 80s as their main they'd be in the top 2 for me, Lakers would be in the list if their purple also looked like how it did in the 80s. Like why do they have black numbers?\n\nBottom 5 (worst is first):\n\n1. Wizards - Just a failure in every single way. When a sports team chooses America as their aesthetic it basically never works unless the jersey is comically American. There's not a whole lot you can do with \"wizards\" and basically every fan made rebrand I've seen either looks bad as well, or goofy so idk what they can do to make it work. Examples for goofy ones [1.](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/imz6ieP.png), [2.](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/3iu1mdo.png). The logo in the 2000s was better but that overall look is dated by today's standards\n\n2. Clippers - Another failure with a logo that looks terrible, the text font is bad. \"Clippers\" suffers from the same problem in which you can't really do anything with it, their old logo is basically the Lakers\n\n3. Rockets - The modern rockets look (Yao Ming\/Harden era) never really clicked with me and their current ones don't impress me, I think it's boring despite the Houston Rockets being a great team name\n\n4. Cavaliers - Their jerseys are so boring, it's just solid burgundy with gold Cleveland text. They've needed a rebrand for so long TBH\n\n5. Raptors - The triangle text is pretty poopy and the logo is bad, surely there's a half way between the 90s look and the bs they have today\n\nWhat I've learned from this is that most NBA teams look pretty mid to bad, aesthetic trends have gone down hill since the mid 2010s in which the league has gone corporate and generic. I really think the late 80s and early 90s have the best jerseys in which most of them looked really clean or at least had a distinct identity for teams.

He went 628-529 in those 16 seasons, yet I feel like he is mostly underappreciated due to a lack of a ring. \n\nHe ran a very free-flowing run-and-gun offense that usually had players only holding the ball for 2 seconds which then resulted in lots of passes, cutting to the basket, screens, and simple jumpers. He allowed his players to essentially be creative, but follow his rule of holding the ball for a short amount of time to catch defenses off guard. In his 16 seasons as head coach, his teams were 1st in pace 12 times and 1st in PT\/G 9 times. His offenses were as much a precursor to the modern NBA as Don Nelson and Rick Adelman's were. I do feel like maybe he doesn't get as much credit due to the era when he coached, and the lack of a ring.\n\nObviously what is interesting is how fast they played obviously came with downsides, his teams were last in PTS\/G allowed 5 times, and in bottom 5 in PTS\/G allowed in every season he coached. His pace may have had a bad effect on how his team was able to play in the playoffs too, since the furthest his teams got were 1 win in the Conference Finals. But in the regular season he still made it to 50+ wins 3 times, and 45+ wins 7 times. \n\nHe further explains how the offense essentially worked: \u201cThe biggest rule is to really push so you don\u2019t let the defenses get set \u2013 and use Mike Adams as an example of that. When he was coming down as the point guard, he would hit the side and cut through. We had him cutting through so the defense couldn\u2019t set up and stay set by our guys standing around. And then we\u2019d swing it, to get it started and not let the defense really set up,\u201d Moe said. \u201cIt was always one of the rules that the guard was to cut through.\"\n\nSpecific Players PTS\/G under Moe:\n\nGeorge Gervin (HOF) Spurs: 28.2\n\nLarry Kenon Spurs: 21.2\n\nAlex English (HOF) Nuggets: 26.0\n\nKiki Vandeweghe Nuggets: 23.3\n\nI'm incredibly interested in his career, since his coaching style was incredibly rare for the time, and looks genius with how the modern NBA looks today. I searched this sub looking for posts on him, and the last one is about 2 years back. Just want to give him some attention because he was a great coach whose style was ahead of its time.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1678473685.0},{"title":"Brook Lopez is the first player in NBA history to record 9+ blocks and 3+ 3 pointers in a single game","author":"CelticsPatsRedSox","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nba\/comments\/11ndcpo\/brook_lopez_is_the_first_player_in_nba_history_to\/","text":"https:\/\/www.statmuse.com\/nba\/ask?q=nba+players+with+9%2B+blocks+and+3%2B+3+pointers+in+a+game\n\nLopez is also the only player to record 8 blocks and 3 treys in a single game (he has done this twice)","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1678418943.0},{"title":"[Greif] At Clippers practice today, Ty Lue says that Norm Powell (shoulder) might be able to take part in some skeleton work today, but said he doesn\u2019t know what, if any, level of contact he\u2019d be able to take.

A quantitative analysis","author":"Sikatanan","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nba\/comments\/11nwh65\/are_todays_refs_soft_a_quantitative_analysis\/","text":"Folks,\n\nAll the recent brouhaha over technicals and Fred VanVleet's comments had me wondering if refs really WERE softer than they used to be. After spending hours trying and mostly falling to locate reliable and complete technical foul data (way harder than you think it would be, and no, teamrankings doesn't have it), I finally discovered total technical fouls by team (important, since it includes coaches) going back to the 2017-2018 season: [https:\/\/www.foxsports.com\/nba\/team-stats?category=misc&sort=dbldbl&season=2022&seasonType=reg&sortOrder=desc](https:\/\/www.foxsports.com\/nba\/team-stats?category=misc&sort=dbldbl&season=2022&seasonType=reg&sortOrder=desc)\n\nI prorated every year to 82 games, and also adjusted for pace (which, in a six-season sample, didn't end up making any noticeable difference, really). Here's what I found:\n\n**TOTAL TECHS ASSESSED AGAINST TEAMS**\n\n2017-2018: 1,455 techs \n\n2018-2019: 1,721 \n\n2019-2020: 1,707  \n\n2020-2021: 1,471  \n\n2021-2022: 1,784\n\n2022-2023 (projected\\*): 1,735\n\nSo basically, if things continue linearly, we will be pretty much in line with what we've seen in three of the last four seasons (I think it's hilarious that in 2020-2021, in the middle of the COVID uncertainty, refs and players were nicer to each other for that one year. Then back to business as usual).\n\nI also decided to further hone in and look at ejections after the Scottie Barnes fiasco. Note that ejections are more likely than technicals to come from player-player confrontations instead of player-ref confrontations, so this isn't a perfect read (and again, it's adjusted for # of games played), but here we are:\n\n**TOTAL EJECTIONS**\n\n2017-2018: 85 ejections\n\n2018-2019: 86 \n\n2019-2020: 72\n\n2020-2021: 72\n\n2021-2022: 99\n\n2022-2023 (projected): 92\n\nPretty small samples, here, and although we're on the higher end, it would still be fewer than last year, if my projections hold. \n\nSo overall, are refs softer now than before? **Not noticeably so!** I think the rise of social media and a string of recent, high-profile incidents just lodge bad techs\/ejections in peoples' minds more firmly than before.\n\nHopefully you all enjoyed this, it took me a shocking amount of time to locate even this paltry data.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*for this year's projections, I'm assuming linear growth on a per-game basis. Maybe that won't happen, as the pressure of the late season leads to more techs and ejections, but I don't have access to point-in-time calculations to look for seasonality effects.","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1678472182.0},{"title":"What if the NBA had a foul penalty system like football (soccer).","author":"BetterYouth1240","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nba\/comments\/11obfax\/what_if_the_nba_had_a_foul_penalty_system_like\/","text":"I wonder how a system of giving fouls like soccer (yellow\/red cards) would change the game.

And books.\n> \n> \u201cAnd we will build a new basketball court in [Irving\u2019s] honor.\u201d\n> \n> And now a famous basketball player whom Mofid has never met has fast-tracked those plans. Mofid said he sent a thank you message to the email address from which Irving\u2019s donation came, but he has no idea whether Irving will see it.\n> \n> \u201cI\u2019d just like to figure out a way to thank him,\u201d Mofid said. \u201cJust so he understands what an impact he\u2019s made.\u201d\n> \n> When the Mavericks acquired Irving from Brooklyn in a blockbuster deal on Feb. 6.

A player qualifies for an All-NBA team if they've played in 70% of their franchise's games. It's 58 out of 82, but as we're doing this as if the season ended today, a player needs to have played in over 70% of their team's games period. So Devin Booker, KD, Zion, AD, Steph Curry are all eliminated.\n2. Everybody can determine their own criteria, but remember that in reality All-NBA team selections are very important as they are directly related to what contract offer a player can receive. For example I was thinking how cool it would be if Jalen Brunson got a selection for a 2nd or 3rd all-nba team, but quickly realised that it would not be a serious selection amongst the season some of the other guards in the league are having.\n\nMy teams:\n\n**All-NBA 1st team:**\n\n**Ja Morant** \\- spectacular season in which he is scoring efficiently in the high 20s, his rebounds are up and assists are still high. Ja has had few triple-doubles and keeps contributing to winning. Let's not forget that this Grizzlies team is amongst the youngest in the league, right there with the Pistons, Hornets, etc. and they were second best in the west before Ja went out cuz of his off-court problems. With Curry out because of lack of games (plus the Warriors winning so little, that would have posed a real question in front of voters), Ja deserves to earn his first All-NBA 1st team.\n\n**Luka Doncic** \\- The Mavs are one of the disappointments of the season. Off of a conference finals series against the Warriors they let Brunson go and made one good addition in Christian Wood. Their record was mediocre until they decided to trade for Kyrie Irving and has stayed mediocre since the arrival of Kyrie. In the midst of all that, Luka has probably had a down year with his defence getting more exposed and constant complaints to the referees getting more annoying, yet he still undoubtedly deserves an All-NBA 1st team selection - that's how great he is! I mean, he is putting up 32, 9 and 8 at 50% and had a 60, 21 and 10 game earlier this season. An easy pick.\n\n**Jayson Tatum** \\- unbelievable season for Jayson Tatum. He's rightfully in the MVP race from the beginning and although Jokic, Embiid and Giannis have separated themselves in the last few weeks, Tatum still easily slots into one of the forward positions. 30 points and 9 boards, a lot of winning and a lot of good defence, although on a team level there's a lot of room for improvement. Can't wait to see Tatum in the playoffs.\n\n**Giannis** \\- don't think I need to sell him. Best player in the league and leads the league in 4th quarter points. He can switch on on offence whenever he wants and stays locked in on defence all the time. That would be his 5th All-NBA 1st team selection. Giannis and the Bucks are my prediction from the east.\n\n**Nikola Jokic** \\- Joel Embiid has been on an absolute tear the past few weeks, and in fact the whole season. 33 points and 10 boards with elite defence is spectacular, and the 76ers have been the third best team in the east and fourth best team in the league. Him being all-nba 2nd team doesn't reflect negatively on Embiid - it just proves how absurd exactly Jokic has been. The man is putting up 24\/12\/10 at historic efficiency and leading a team without an all-star or all-nba selection (but granted - a really well constructed team with 3-pt weapons, good defenders and Jamal Murray) to the best record in the west. I saw his defence get exposed the last few nights and have not decided on my MVP pick yet, as there's a good number of games left including direct battles between Jokic\/Embiid, Jokic\/Giannis and Giannis\/Embiid. But if the season ended today, he'd be my MVP and all-nba 1st team selection.\n\n**All-NBA 2nd team:**\n\nJames Harden\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander\n\nLebron James\n\nJulius Randle\n\nJoel Embiid\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**All-NBA 3rd team:**\n\nD'Aron Fox\n\nDonovan Mitchell\n\nLauri Markannen\n\nJaylen Brown\n\nDomantas Sabonis","upvote_ratio":0.35,"created_utc":1678584467.0},{"title":"Draymonds 3 pointer should have been a 2 at 7:50 in the 4th","author":"54footy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nba\/comments\/11p4o7w\/draymonds_3_pointer_should_have_been_a_2_at_750\/","text":"Did they rescind this?

This dude has been giving players more trouble than Ja when he was playing.","upvote_ratio":0.45,"created_utc":1678571174.0},{"title":"[Highlight] Foul on Brook Lopez block gets overturned and he now has 8 blocks on the night!","author":"Zhugo","url":"https:\/\/streamable.com\/8cgc7b","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1678417644.0},{"title":"Tyrese Haliburton in win vs Rockets: 29 points, 2 rebounds, 19 assists","author":"OladipoForThree","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nba\/comments\/11nc8w6\/tyrese_haliburton_in_win_vs_rockets_29_points_2\/","text":"Haliburton with another special game just days off of a 40pt\/16 reb game.
