        "text": "Hello Reddit!\n\nWe are the Cheetah Conservation Fund, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that is based in Namibia Africa &amp; Washington DC!\n\nWe are here today talking about our new education initiative - Holistic Conservation.\n\nOur organization is dedicated to the conservation and the protection of the cheetah as a species, but we understand that conservation is not simply just one species. It is everything that lives in the ecosystem, so this includes all animals, plants, everything that is connected. We have learned many different conservation tactics in Namibia, and we are presenting these ideas to zoos and other organizations across the United States (currently the only country we are doing this right now.) Our goal is simple, we want to spread the message of holistic conservation. We do not want to tell people what to do, we just simply want to get the conservation started and educate people.\n\nWe are going to be providing some information you may find interesting. If you would like to pass this onto any organizations who may also be interested, feel free to!\n\nThis education series primary speaker is Brian Badger. He was the Director of Operations of our Namibian Conservation Facility.\n\nHere is a video of him talking to a group of zookeepers and the public at Tuscon Arizona (Run time 1 Hour+) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfkmK3z7JZw&amp;t=1230s\n\nWe also have a biography on Brian and other information about the program. If you have any questions please feel free to send us a message on Reddit or you can go to our website to learn more: http://cheetah.org/2017/01/frontline-conservation-presentations-ccfs-brian-badger/\n\nThanks again for your time! This year, we are pushing forward to help educate people as much as possible about holistic conservation practices. While this world is beautiful, we have to work to make sure that the ecosystems in it are preserved and protected.\n\nSincerely,\n\nCCF Reddit Team",

Do you return to the same job annually or are you always trying new things? Do you see seasonal employment as a way towards a permanent \"higher-up\" job or grad school, or are you satisfied with field work as a long term career?\n\nThank you for your responses. I have worked and enjoyed a few seasonal positions but I'm struggling because I don't know where I want or ought to go in the long term. Hopefully your responses will give me an idea of the various paths people take.",

In March our field trip is to a condor breeding center north of the Grand Canyon, but I'm at a loss for book recommendations from which we can choose.\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas? Novels or memoirs are the best - we've tried 'heavy' scientific books and they just don't fly with the book club attendees. Not saying fluff is better, but there needs to be some semblence of a story.",
