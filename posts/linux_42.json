There's still no support for external system tools like panels and notifications. Apps that need to set their positions for any reason just can't. I was trying to develop something and I'm just now discovering that there's no form of window ID's. And all these issues have been brought up before but the developers say \"it's by design\" and close the issue.\n\nI hear a lot of things about security and codebases and stuff but I doubt that's the reason people are using it. (Other than GNOME users who use it so that their dialogs float in the center of the window,) is anyone actually using it for a reason other than to prevent screen tearing? Is anyone just using it for fun?",

I use this as a programming computer. I was looking at cutefish because of the interface and how modern and lite it looked in my opinion but after a little research i didn't go with it because of the os still being under development, which has more room for errors and bugs. I then found zorin os which was by far a great looking distro and honestly the window type looking distro really looks tempting. Im currently formatting my usb to burn the iso or zorin to give it an install. regardless im getting rid of ubuntu to many issues since i first got it. How was your experiences with zorin? Is there any major or minor bugs that made you change your mind about it? please share.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/zjsd7t/yet_another_why_i_went_back_from_sway_wayland_to/",
        "text": "After daily driving i3 for quite a while now, I have decided to finally try out Sway (and Wayland). To be fair, there was no reason for me to leave the i3 ,my setup works just fine , but I wanted to see what the fuss was about, try out \"the latest and greatest\", and maybe pave a way to me finally getting some HiDPI monitors.\n\nSo, I installed Sway onto my computer, spent several days recreating my setup and then spent couple of weeks using it as my daily driver. Over time I have encountered many issues, small and large and I have managed to find the workaround for most of them, but in the end several issues irked me enough that I have decided to go back to i3 (and X11).\n\nFollowing are the descriptions of the most annoying/surprising issues that I have faced.\n\n# No Monitor Mirroring\n\nThis was the first weird thing that I have noticed: Sway does not natively support monitor cloning.\n\nFor me this was pretty weird omission. It is not that infrequent that I either need to mirror my PC to home TV or my laptop to a projector for a meeting.\n\n[Github issue has been opened since 2018](https://github.com/swaywm/sway/issues/1666) with not much being done since. Luckily, there is a good workaround for the issue: wl-mirror applicaton that is basically a window that displays a mirror of another monitor. That way, I can just add monitor I want to mirror to as an extra workspace and put wl-mirror onto that monitor in full screen. It works well, but it feels like an extra hassle for what seems to be a basic feature on every other window manager.\n\n# No proper fractional scaling\n\nWayland is a big step forward in HiDPI department: User can have multiple monitors, each with different scaling level, which allows user to mix low and high DPI monitors.\n\nUnfortunately, Wayland is also a step backwards in HiDPI department: Wayland applications do not seem to natively support fractional HiDPI scaling at the moment. While you can set fractional scale values, at least in Sway, Wayland applications will always be upscaled to the nearest higher integer value and then downscaled back down to the selected scaling fraction. This seems to work fairly well in practice, but it means unnecessary extra GPU power to render applications in higher resolution, just to downscale them afterward. It also nullifies all font anti-aliasing.\n\nNow, many people in the community just suggest to \"not use fractional scaling\" and to \"just get such a monitor size that will be able to scale with integer scaling\". Unfortunately, this often does not work in practice:\n\nFor example, for me, the sweet spot between monitor size and screen real-estate is 27'' 2560x1440 monitor. If I wanted to get HiDPI version of that with integer scaling, I would have to buy 27'' 5120x2880 monitor. Such monitors are pretty rare and prohibitively expensive, since they are almost always paired together with very accurate colors and other similar features aimed at artists, which significantly inflate the price. Getting ordinary 27'' 4K is a much better value proposition, but that would mean either using 1.5x scaling, which has above issues, or using 2x scaling, which would significantly reduce the screen real estate compared to my current monitors.\n\nLuckily, this situation is being worked on. [Fractional scaling protocol](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/-/merge_requests/143) that enables proper fractional scaling has been already merged into wayland specification. Hopefully client applications and compositors will implement it soon.\n\n# Urgency is not working with Wayland windows\n\nWith i3, whenever I open a link or anything else in the background workspace, [workspace indicator will color red](https://i.imgur.com/xvXM8vk.png), telling me that something is going on there - this feature is called Urgency.\n\nUnfortunately, this does not seem to work on native Wayland windows, however I am not sure why. [xdg-activation protocol](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/-/merge_requests/50) that is supposed to provide this, has been created and merged into Sway, and [Firefox has also implemented this feature](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1744002). Yet, opening a link in Firefox that is in a background workspace, will not produce urgency indicator. Interesting thing is that [Sway's manpage](https://manpages.debian.org/experimental/sway/sway.5.en.html) mentions \"Note: Native Wayland windows do not support urgency. Urgency only works for Xwayland windows.\", but it could be just a case of outdated documentation.\n\n# No good way for app to tell WM that window is a popup\n\nX windows have a property, called window_role. This allowed program to signal to a window manager, what role this window does. Specifically to this issue, program could set the role to \"popup\". With that, one could set up a single blanket rule in i3 that would treat all popups as floating:\n\n`for_window [window_role=\"dialog\"] floating enable`\n\nUnfortunately, there is no such equivalent in Wayland and [most popups open as a full windows by default](https://i.imgur.com/0AikGVk.gif).\n\nOf course, a workaround here is to match popup by the window title inside Sway config. But this is tedious to do for every single popup and it also does not work with dynamically named popups, such as browser popups from webpages.\n\n[I have asked sway developers about this situation](https://github.com/swaywm/sway/issues/7223) and got told that this should not be handled by the WM. Apps should open popups within their client space instead of creating full windows. I guess it is one way to solve this, but apps are not doing this and this solution also prevents us from moving popup to, let's say, another monitor.\n\nTo be fair, though, this issue is specific to the tiling window managers. Most other regular window managers do not experience this issue, which is likely why it has not received enough much attention to get worked on.\n\n# Drag and drop between Wayland and X applications is broken\n\nThis issue was probably the deal-breaker that made me go back to i3 for the time being. Throughout my workflow, I make an extensive use of the drag dropping between applications. For native Wayland applications, this work fine. But many applications, for example everything Java-based, VLC etc. are still running in XWayland, where [drag and drop does not work at all](https://i.imgur.com/zW2IT06.gif).\n\n[There are several issues on the Sway issue tracker on this since 2020](https://github.com/swaywm/sway/issues/5355), so it does not appear this will get solved anytime soon. Since Wayland-to-Wayland application drag dropping works fine, this issue might actually eventually resolve itself by just having most applications natively supporting Wayland.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nI went back to X, mostly due to above issues. However, most of above issues either have a good workaround or their fixes are in development. So I do nott think that is the end of Wayland for me though. I am actively monitoring threads for all below issues and I will come back if/when they all are fixed or have good workarounds.",

        "author": "boutnaru",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/zjpf40/linux_namespaces_time_namespace/",
        "text": " In the first part of the series we have talked generally about what are namespace and what we can do with them - in case you want to go over it you can use the following link [https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-namespaces-part-1-dcee9c40fb68](https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-namespaces-part-1-dcee9c40fb68). Now we are going to deep dive into the time namespaces.\n\nBy using time namespaces we can separate/isolate/segregate and thus virtualize the values of two system clocks ([https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/time\\_namespaces.7.html](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/time_namespaces.7.html)). We are talking about “CLOCK\\_MONOTONIC” and “CLOCK\\_BOOTTIME”.\n\n“CLOCK\\_MONOTONIC” goal is to represent an absolute elapsed wall-clock time since some arbitrary, fixed point in the past. It is important to understand that it isn't affected by changes in the system time-of-day clock. As opposed to “CLOCK\\_REALTIME” which can change based on configurations/NTP (Network Time Protocol) data ([https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3523442/difference-between-clock-realtime-and-clock-monotonic](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3523442/difference-between-clock-realtime-and-clock-monotonic)).  Moreover, “CLOCK\\_MONOTONIC” does not measure time spent during suspend. If we want a monotonic clock that is running during suspend we need to use “CLOCK\\_BOOTTIME” ([https://linux.die.net/man/2/clock\\_gettime](https://linux.die.net/man/2/clock_gettime)).  \n\nThus, all the processes in the same time namespace share the same values of the clocks explained above. Due to that, it affect the results of the following syscalls: timer\\_settime (“man 2 timer\\_settime”, clock\\_gettime (“man 2 clock\\_gettime”), clock\\_nanosleep (“man 2 clock\\_nanosleep”), timerfd\\_settime (“man 2 timerfd\\_settime”). Also, the content returned from “/proc/uptime” is affected.  \n\nIn order to create a new time namespace we have to use the unshare syscall (“man 2 unshare”) and pass the “CLONE\\_NEWTIME” flag. You can see an example of that using the “unshare” cli tool (“man 1 unshare”) in the screenshot below. In order to see the difference between the initial time namespace and the process’ time namespace we can use “/proc/\\[PID\\]/timens\\_offsets” also shown in the screenshot below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hj27kxqnre5a1.png?width=391&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d961468183944e744f5969dfd6fde30e28e8149",

        "text": "I recently started following the [Learn OpenGL tutorial](https://learnopengl.com/) and noticed that when I create a window with [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) in the Wayland GNOME session the cursor becomes much larger when hovering over the window. This is because a Wayland client is expected to define its own pointer (cursor) and that seems to lead to inconsistencies between implementations. I do not have a problem with [CSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-side_decoration) being default on Wayland (I even prefer it when done really well, like [Telegram Desktop](https://desktop.telegram.org/), or any GTK app with [GtkHeaderBar](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.HeaderBar.html)) but the cursor switching scale while moving it over surfaces (windows) is much more jarring.\n\nI decided to investigate how different Wayland client implementations behave with cursor scaling across 4 different Wayland compositors at different scale factors to get an overview of the situation. Below are my findings. As you can see, cursor scaling on Wayland is messy, with the reference Wayland compositor implementation [Weston](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/weston) performing the worst.

This gets my SDcard reader working in the OS just fine.\n\nI want to use it in pre-boot as a LUKS key however, and have adapted this tutorial for USBs to do so, adapting the script as needed and adding sdhci, sdhci-pci, mmc_core, and mmc_block to my /etc/initramfs-tools/modules file such that they should be available in preboot.\n\nHowever I think my pre-boot environment isn't detecting the SDcard, dmesg shows an\n\nmmc0: Timeout waiting for hardware interrupt.\n\n...\n\nerror in the preboot phase that appears the same as the error I was getting before applying the debug_quirks2 fix in the OS, so I'm wondering how to apply that same fix in the initramfs/preboot environment so I can proceed.\n\nThanks for any advice anyone can give",
