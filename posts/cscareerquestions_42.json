Even if I fall short I’ll only be better at my trade and have acquired desirable skills.\n\nStuff I know/have made dynamic projects with previously: react.JS/nodejs/expressjs/axios/MySQL/mongodb/AWS ec2, s3, lambda, rds and PyGame and svelteKit\n\nAny ideas or even general advice very welcome.",

        "text": "As the title states, I've been unemployed for 6 months. I graduated from a T15 uni with a Biochem degree. I did computational biophysics research in undergrad, worked at a biotech company postgrad, got laid off after 2.5 months and have been unemployed since. I did take a slight break to deal with some emergencies (friend committed suicide and grandfather passed away), but I've been quite active with applying. I've tried staying within science, and even applied to a few swe roles at tech companies, but I mostly fail to get past resume screens. For the interviews I have gotten, I make it all the way to the final round just to get a rejection. Just today, I got rejected after a final round interview that went really well. I was told that I wasn't experienced enough after a full day interview which had 7 one-on-one interviews and a 1 hour research presentation. Even finding a job to apply to in biotech/pharma is hard because all the research positions that pay a livable wage require PhD's, and I'm no longer interested in pursuing a PhD. I'm jaded from biotech and want to transition.\n\nI've been interested in finance opportunities, especially at quant firms, for some time. While I never applied before to trading firms or investment banks, I have been reading books, articles, and research journals on financial math, economics, and the stock market for a couple of years. As much as I'm interested in the field, I've been a bit hesitant to apply because I always worried that my profile would be overlooked. I am also kind of desperate for any opportunity at this point. I wouldn't mind positions in quant research/trading, swe, project management, or even rotational development programs at these companies. I'm not sure if this mindset of applying to a variety of positions in an attempt to transition is correct. As someone trying to get away from science, I just want some advice. If there is some specific career path I should follow that would be better for someone like me to target, let me know. I attached my resume here, I modified it to be a bit more appropriate for finance and I tried making some projects. Any feedback on my resume, as well as other advice is appreciated. If you have other questions, feel free to ask.\n\n https://imgur.com/t79hEWA",

This is something that SD and I strongly expressed to multiple people involved in this reorg that we wanted to avoid, and we were told it wouldn’t happen but now it’s back on the table as a possibility to management (but not yet confirmed). \n\nAlong with all of this, I was also just told recently that I should not expect any compensation adjustment for this year since I am already at the compensation cap for my title. Is this even true or just something they say to lie to lower-level employees?\n\nI also tried asking early on in the reorg if I could transfer teams internally but was told that wasn’t possible since they needed someone with experience on these services to stay with SD.\n\nWhat should I do? Can I ask the person above my manager for a team transfer? It’s especially annoying because one of the reasons I wanted to work at this company was to work with big teams of people!",

Also really interesting because I haven't done much web stuff in my hobby projects.\n\nI don't really want to stay at either of these companies for more than 1.5 years because I want to experience different workplaces and areas in SWE during my bsc. I also don't know what Im eventually going to specialize in but its most likely not going to be web development. I still would like to have a webdev internship under my belt.\n\nWhat do you guys think would be best for my career? Would an embedded internship look better or worse on my cv than a webdev internship? Considering that I'll probably not go into webdevelopment (it-sec, ml and hpc are on my \"interesting\" list).\n\nThanks",

It's a \\~2.5 year masters degree program which would cost me \\~100k in tuition/fees, but I could easily start making \\~200k immediately after completing the program. The job is very different from software dev but pays well and has good WLB. I shadowed an AA and think I'd be happy doing the job. \n\nAny advice on picking a path?",

But I still want to practice blameless culture as an individual (as much as I can).\n\n**So how do I do that?**\n\nI already try to avoid blaming other people, but that isn't a good strategy. In my brain, I don't blame people: but other people still take it that way (because of a culture of fear). If I directly tell people \"I don't blame you\", that just makes it worse.\n\nInstead, I try to practice radical honesty and transparency as an individual. Maybe most people in my company don't practice honesty and transparency, but I still try my best to do that.\n\nMy other idea is to avoid getting emotional when other people blame me. If I get blamed for something, then I just accept it (and maybe try to act differently in the future).\n\nThoughts? Thanks",

I am a software engineering student graduating in April, and I started working at a company in November 2021, and I ended up getting an internship with the same company, although it isn’t a Software Engineering internship. They kind of merged two roles into one, and I am working on algorithms in excel. The experience I am getting is pretty niche, and specific to the company. They extended the internship another 3 months, and I am currently working there. They offered to turn my internship into a full-time salaried job for $55,000 a year. I would have a 30-minute commute. I am living in a very low-cost area, so that is plenty. They need a response to the offer by Feb 21st, but I am also interviewing for a Junior Dev job at a different smaller company, and have my second interview with them on Friday, the 17th. This position would be remote, and I am guessing they wouldn’t hire me for more than $50,000.\n\nMy question is, with the timing, do I have enough time for the second company to give me an offer? My current company gave me a week from when the offer was extended, and I don’t know how they would take it if I asked for an extension to respond. If the second company does give me an offer, career-wise, which would be a better decision? I would love to be a developer but I also love the internship that I currently have (that would then turn into a full-time job). With my current company, I don’t see a clear career path I could take, but with the Junior Dev job, it is much clearer to me.\n\nI would love any and all advice on the timing of the offer, as well as which one I should accept (if I even get an offer from the second company).",

My goal is to get a junior position, ideally in something backend related, and I should probably have some portfolio projects to put on a resume before applying. But at this stage, I'm really uncertain what kind of projects to try and do.\n\nA lot of websites/posts online suggest projects that require knowledge of SQL, Flask/Django or some other application/framework, so I'm unsure if I should start learning one of those first? Can anyone who's been in a similar position offer any advice? Thanks!",

        "text": "Hello all. I'm a CS major who has been graduated less than a year. I worked one Software Engineering job for six months right out of school and hated it. Not because of the work, but because of the company.\n\nHating this job made it an easy decision to smoke weed after work, despite the company doing random drug testing. You know where this is going, I got fired. I don't need anyone to tell me I'm stupid, I already figured that part out.\n\nSo I've been on the hunt for a few months, and have all the normal complaints of \"entry-level\" jobs requiring 2+ years experience (advertising jobs this way should be illegal imo but that's off topic).\n\nThe problem is I've been lying in every single interview, saying I left my SE job voluntarily. And my interviews have not been working out. My best opportunity right now is an IT position I'm overqualified for (this employer only prefers, doesn't require, an associates degree). The pay is dogshit, 18/hr when I was making 30/hr before. I want to stay in software engineering or development and get an entry-level job that's actually, ya know, entry-level.\n\nAm I doing the right thing by lying? How can I convince companies my Bachelor's in CS + six months experience is even worth anything? I feel like I wasted my time getting this degree because it only gets me to a phone interview. Companies assume I have no ability to code with this degree which doesn't make sense. I know my ability level compared with my peers and I know I can perform work worth 30/hr for new company.\n\nThis probably reads like a million other posts in this sub. But I feel like I am asking for a very basic level of respect from companies and they just are not willing provide that for someone with less than 5 years experience. Do I need a reality check?",

        "text": "After an entire year of job-hunting after graduation, I was finally offered (and accepted) a junior Python role at a small non-profit startup.\n\nAside from a data engineer who I reported to, I was the only one in-house in any sort of programming role, and also the first full-time developer in the organization. There was no senior equivalent of my role for me to learn from. I've also had to work on a number of projects that aren't strictly Python-based: database maintenance and ingestion (Postgres/TimescaleDB), setup of AWS services, Docker containers etc.\n\nI'm not complaining about that last part: I've had the opportunity to develop a broad skill-set independently. On the other hand, this has also meant that I didn't get as much Python SWE experience as I would have liked, so I feel like my programming knowledge has atrophied.\n\nA little over 3 years after starting, I've been laid off (financial reasons) and I'm not sure where to go from here. Any SWE role I look into seems to need someone more specialized (at least for Python), and like I said, my skill-set has broadened, but not deepened.\n\nHave I overestimated the level of knowledge required for other SWE roles? Broadly speaking, what type of roles should I be looking for if I only know a little bit about a lot of things?\n\nTL;DR: Python programming ability stagnated for 3 years at my first job, while having to work with AWS, TimescaleDB and others. Where do I go now?",

        "text": "Hello! \n\nSo I recently graduated from Columbia University, and I’m torn between trying to get a software engineering job or going into the product and UX route (in which I have experience in). \n\nI got a double degree in Computer Science and Neuroscience. Both with gpa of 3.9. \n\nHere is the thing- I do want to become a software engineer, and I think I have the right personality for it. However, I genuinely don’t feel like I am good at coding, even if I got good grades. I struggled a lot in all of my CS classes and spent hours at office hours, reading other people’s codes online and asking help from my classmates in most assignments until they worked. And after four years, I truly don’t feel like I know how to code. I am also terrible at math.\n\nAll my other CS friends tell me it’s “easy” (they work for Amazon), and I just have to practice LeetCode for the interviews. But I don’t think that’s true, and I don’t believe LeetCode projects are that easy to learn. I couldn’t get through one assignment:( \n\nI’ve always had really low self-esteem about not being good enough in CS, but I do think it’s for a reason, and maybe I should just focus on getting different positions? \n\nI also didn’t do any CS internships during uni since I worked full-time for three years at a startup as a program manager. \n\nThanks a lot for the help:)",

But the problem is I am a complete noob at this and dont know where to even start at. Can anyone guide me here and recommend me a few good resources so that I can get started ASAP. Your help would be much appreciated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks a lot for your time.",
