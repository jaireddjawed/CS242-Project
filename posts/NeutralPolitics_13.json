The last-minute dismissal [reduced and/or delayed some of McCabe's benefits under his government pension.](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/16/politics/andrew-mccabe-pension-if-fired/index.html) \n\nThe firing resulted from a [report](https://judiciary.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/041318_McCabe-Report.pdf) by the Department of Justiceâ€™s inspector general that was just released to the public today. It [sharply criticizes McCabe](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/13/fbi-mccabe-fired-inspector-general-report-522580) for unauthorized disclosures to the media ahead of the 2016 election and lacking candor with investigators.\n\nFor his part, McCabe, a long time Republican, [believes he was targeted and eventually fired because of the work he did on the Russia probe,](https://www.vox.com/2018/3/16/17132418/andrew-mccabe-statement) and as part of a larger effort by the president and his supporters to discredit the FBI.\n\nMy questions are about the norms of firing for cause at the Federal level:\n\n* The IG's report outlines four incidents of violation of FBI policy, but doesn't recommend what should be done with McCabe. Was his firing for lack of candor within established norms, even considering his long history with the bureau?\n* McCabe had resigned his post months before the firing and was on paid leave at the time, so he wasn't working at the FBI, but the President had previously [urged the Attorney General to fire him](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/26/us/politics/jeff-sessions-trump-mccabe.html) multiple times. Is it unusual for a President to recommend the AG fire a specific person at the FBI, even one who is not currently working at the bureau?\n* Is it common that the IG would provide the report to the Attorney General so far in advance of providing it to Congress and the public? Is there evidence that the report was rushed to the powers that be in order to beat the clock on McCabe's pending retirement?\n* Overall, even if the firing was justified, is there evidence to suggest it was done in a vindictive manner, or can such suggestions be chalked up to coincidence?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/8b25l4/under_the_1996_federal_communications_decency_act/",
        "text": "[Links posted to demonstrate underlying sentiments exist, not as a source of their truth.]\n\nIn lieu of Facebook's Cambridge Analytica breach / misuse of data, there has been a general clamor to better address online user-generated content. ProPublica has posted [four proposals](https://www.propublica.org/article/four-ways-to-fix-facebook), one of which (#3) included updating the 1996 federal Communications Decency Act to remove immunity from liability for published third-party content.\n\nThis proposal deals less with privacy and more with the questionable substantive content posted on Internet platforms such as Facebook. The [historical justification](https://www.law.com/therecorder/sites/therecorder/2017/11/10/cda-230-then-and-now-does-intermediary-immunity-keep-the-rest-of-us-healthy/) for immunity was an acknowledgment that Internet businesses were an emerging technology that needed room to breath in order to flourish, and that liability would effectively quash their ability to scale writ large:\n\n&gt;This strange medium-specific subsidy for online content platforms made good if not perfect sense in 1996. (My generally positive thinking about it from that time, including some reservations, can be found here.) The Internet was newly mainstream, and many content portals comprised the proverbial two people in a garage. To impose upon them the burdens of traditional media would presumably require tough-to-maintain gatekeeping. Comments sections, if they remained at all, would have to be carefully screened to avoid creating liability for the company. What made sense for a newspaper publishing at most five or six letters a day amidst its more carefully vetted articles truly couldnâ€™t work for a small Internet startup processing thousands or even millions of comments or other contributions in the same interval. Over time, the reviews elicited by Yelp and TripAdvisor, the financial markets discussions on Motley Fool, the evolving articles on user-edited Wikipediaâ€”all are arguably only possible thanks to that Â§230 immunity conferred in 1996.\n\nThe present argument for removing that liability is an acknowledged change in this landscape, namely that the Internet companies have gotten better at operating at scale, with many of the big players having requisite resources to better manage content and deal with liability claims if they fail to perform:\n\n&gt;Perhaps the evolution of the merits of equal treatment for state sales tax provides a good model for a refined CDA: companies below a certain size or activity threshold could benefit from its immunities, while those who grow large enough to facilitate the infliction of that much more damage from defamatory and other actionable posts might also have the resources to employ a compliance department. That would militate towards at least some standard to meet in vetting or dealing with posts, perhaps akin to the light duties of booksellers or newsstands towards the wares they stock rather than the higher ones of newspapers towards the letters they publish.\n\nIn contrast, organizations like the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230) contend that s. 230 is the cornerstone of Internet speech protection:\n\n&gt;[It] would be infeasible for online intermediaries to prevent objectionable content from cropping up on their site. Rather than face potential liability for their users' actions, most would likely not host any user content at all or would need to protect themselves by being actively engaged in censoring what we say, what we see, and what we do online. In short, CDA 230 is perhaps the most influential law to protect the kind of innovation that has allowed the Internet to thrive since 1996.\n\n&gt;CDA 230 also offers its legal shield to bloggers who act as intermediaries by hosting comments on their blogs. Under the law, bloggers are not liable for comments left by readers, the work of guest bloggers, tips sent via email, or information received through RSS feeds. This legal protection can still hold even if a blogger is aware of the objectionable content or makes editorial judgments.\n \n\n*Also referenced:*\n\n- Danielle Keats Citron and Benjamin Wittes,*The Internet Will Not Break: Denying Bad Samaritans Â§ 230 Immunity*, 86 Fordham L.

Among other points, it asserts that since accession to the WTO, China's subsidies, currency manipulation and high tariffs have ballooned the trade deficit and cost millions of American jobs.\n\nOn the other hand, economists widely agree that [the benefits of free trade outweigh the costs.](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/free-trade) Previous experiments with trade sanctions have [temporarily preserved small numbers of jobs at a huge cost to US consumers.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-tariffs-has-the-u-s-tried-in-the-past-and-how-did-they-work-out/)\n\nQuestions:\n\n* Are China's trade policies widely regarded as \"unfair\"?\n* Have those policies caused the widening trade deficit and/or a decline in US jobs?\n* To what degree have China's trade policies affected the wider US economy, both positively and negatively?\n",
