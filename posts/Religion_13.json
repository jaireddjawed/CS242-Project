        "text": "I've noticed something recently that I call \"spiritual perfectionism\" and I'd love to hear what others think.\n\nMy initial thoughts on this are that there's an unspoken expectation that spiritual awakening means looking and acting like Jesus Christ, the Buddha, Saint Francis, Mother Theresa, or \\[insert idealized spiritual figure\\].\n\nWhen we fall short of this imagined perfection, our inner critic berates us. And we fall deeper into self-hatred, or unworthiness. \n\nA part of us uses this psychological self-punishment to try and make us \"better,\" (likely imitating the punishment of parents, teachers, or spiritual leaders) but in reality it pushes us further from true awakening, which is the total loving acceptance of ourselves and the world.\n\nAll perfectionism is based on the fear that if we are not perfect (or at least excellent) we will be unworthy of the love we so desperately need.   Because humanity unknowingly idealizes spiritual leaders and masters to such a high degree, perfectionism can be dangerously invisible on the spiritual path.\n\nIn other words, spiritual perfectionism is a spiritual trap.\n\nRead more thoughts on this [here](https://www.stableawakening.com/post/spiritual-perfectionism-and-what-to-do-about-it).",

The gay and non-traditional people I was exposed growing up would talk about how Jesus had helped them achieve victory over their gender or sexuality (as anything ‚Äònon traditional‚Äô, cis-het, is a sin).

        "text": "If the Bible told you that the only way to save yourself from \"Hell\" was to jump off a bridge and die would you do it? I used to be Christian until I realized that it's all a load of garbage that people who don't think for themselves buy into, I believe in spirits and what we like to call the unseen realms and I believe that we are being guided by divine support of some kind, but I learned that through my objective personal experiences, not through some book that you weren't there to witness the creation of, you are welcome to have your own opinions on things however I would like to state my case and let me start off with a few points the Bible makes, for starters it says that if you do not accept that Jesus christ is your lord and savior that you will burn for all eternity in \"hell\" and it says that God is and infinite creator and loves us all unconditionally, does God make mistakes? The Bible says he makes no mistakes and he's a perfect God, well I can not understand how a God who loves each and every one of his children unconditionally would send his children to \"hell\" for doing something known as \"sinning\" which is something that we cannot escape from doing in this reality, he knows you are going to \"sin\" before you are even born yet you should feel guilty about the things you do that the Bible tells you not to, and pray to this man called Jesus christ whom none of us have met in person and if you don't well then off to \"hell\" you go for having your own thoughts and feelings and making decisions, if this Christian \"God\" truly cared about his children then you would think he would actually come down and make it clear instead of telling you to blindly believe in a book written  thousands of years ago by supposedly multiple sources and if you don't then again, off to \"hell\" you go, I mean, I wouldn't send my child to hell to burn for all eternity because he or she made some bad decisions, but a God who supposedly unconditionally loves all of his children will without question, that's like starting a house on fire and getting mad because the house burned down, like what the hell did you expect was gonna happen, God would have had to create sin if he's the creator of all, but he's gonna get mad at you for doing what you are programmed to do and punish you for all eternity for it, it does not take a genius to see that there is absolutely no logic in this reasoning and to believe it shows the lack of ability to form your own reasoning. Let's talk about how the Christians claim the Bible is divinely inspired, how the heck would you know for sure? Were you there to witness it being written? Didn't think so. Yet they claim this is an undisputable fact, very laughable. Let's talk about how the bible says that Christianity is the only religion that is correct and the rest are all wrong yet most religions are very similar in general principles, but MY religion is the only right one because the Bible says so, talk about stupidity and not thinking outside of the box and being taught to specifically stay inside the box, \"don't even think of trying other religions because I'm the only God to worship, and if you do you are believing in false idols which God hates\" that's akin to saying \"do not leave the box because that's a sin and you will be punished, don't think for yourself and come to your own conclusions because that's a sin\" if God gave you a brain with free will then you would think he would want you to use it but instead forming your own thoughts and opinions is \"WRONG\". Okay let's talk about how \"God\" says that fear is of the devil, yet it says fear of the lord is good and you should fear him, fear something that is supposed to love you unconditionally and always wants what's best for you, talk about contradiction, I've heard Christians make the argument that the fear for God is so you respect him, yeah because you need to fear somebody to have respect for them that makes total sense uh huh. Honestly I could keep going but I've already been typing this on a slow phone for awhile, if you want to keep believing in Christianity you go right ahead and make your own choices, I think you are ignorant but you are free to believe what you want, I do believe in something whether you want to call it God or the all or the universe but I believe religion is all just a very little truth mixed in with countless lies to frame the true picture in a false sense. Follow your intuition and follow your heart and its desires, how I truly feel has yet to lead me wrong but blindly believing things because other people and sources outside of yourself tell you to, now whaatt couuulldd go wrooooongg with that...?",

        "text": "For context, I'm an ex-muslim with many very devout Islamic friends. Recently, my friends have started increasing their knowledge and degree of worship, like learning more surahs, reading the quran, hadiths, the works. I'm very happy for them as they seem passionate and content (though I am annoyed by their attempts to erm...'bring me back to the path' when I've expressed no desire to')\n\n\nRecently, this one specific friend of mine has expressed a desire to attempt to 'convert' friends of ours who happen to be of other religions, much to my horror. To him, he obviously believes Islam to be the absolute truth, and that by spreading this truth, he's in a way 'saving' these friends. He's already tried it on a Christian friend of ours, who expressed an obvious disinterest and dislike towards the... advances? \n\n\n\nThis friend has expressed to me that he fully believes Islam and has 'proof' that it's the one true religion, like the Quran predicting the expansion of the universe, stuff like that. And due to my lack of knowledge, I can't exactly debunk these claims or provide 'evidence' on behalf of other religions (the idea of 'proof' for any religion is already silly to me but whatever) but I would like to as best as possible convey to this friend that his attempts at conversion on these people who have expressed no such desire to begin with is disrespectful, out of line, and honestly doesn't do the religion any favours in my opinion. \n\n\nHe's tried to justify it to me by saying that he simply wants to make these people think about the 'logic' of their religion, or to 'corner them' into thinking more about potential contradictions or mechanics of their religion (his words, not mine) which I think is, frankly, pretty insane in a very not good way. \n\n\n\nIn his eyes, he's simply trying to save his friends by bringing them to the right path, and he's fulfilling his duty as a Muslim by doing this. \n\n\nIn my eyes, what he's doing is putting other people on the spot, rather disrespectfully questioning the validity of their entire faith, of which those people are certainly 100% more knowledgeable than himself, and potentially ending friendships.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/10rig5i/when_speaking_about_the_debates_surrounding/",
        "text": "So when it comes to my background even though I am Canadian, I was born in the Caribbean and come from a Caribbean Christian household. My father came from the poor urban slums of the Caribbean raised by a single mother with cancer. My mother came from a rural background. They embraced Christianity because of the work the Church did in their settings and the work female deacons played in promoting the faith.\n\nAnyways how does this connect to creationism and evolution? Well in the case of my mother she has a very simple, straightforward literal reading if the Biblical text because that straightforward simple way of reading the Bible in her context is what makes sense of the world. So in that context, when talking about something like Darwin's theory of evolution she rejects it because it.....well goes against a simple, straightforward reading of the Bible.\n\nIn the case of my father its a little more complex. Despite his urban poor background, he rose through the grit of his teeth to become a teacher who has experience in learning geography, politics and critical theory in many areas. So he's studied thinkers as varied as Malthus and Karl Marx and has tomes of books in social theory. As a result of his complex background he would be someone that is culturally traditional(because Caribbean cultural is very traditional) but in his political and social leanings are to the left. This was amplified by the fact that the context he was living in was one where decolonisation and opposition to Western imperialism was huge and he was involved in the social movements around those topics. In that context he interprets Christianity by instinct in that social and cultural context.\n\nIn terms of how that connects to the creation/evolution conversation, it kinda goes like this. On the one hand I have also heard, like my mother, criticise and condemn the theory of evolution, saying it goes against the Bible and Christian belief. But paradoxically in other conversations in passing when we talk about things like world or African history, I've heard him say in passing \"oh and you when human beings came out of Africa\" which is the basis of human evolution, and I've also heard him speak about the development of Australian Aborigines culture over thousands of years. When the American presidential elections in 2016 were happening and Dr Ben Carson got into that controversy over the Pyramids and creationism, I remember him saying kind of amusingly how what Ben Carson said was the \"stupidest thing I've ever heard\" and \"of course idiots like Ben Carson are gonna say that\".\n\nIt was kind of a paradox to me that someone like my father can say on the one hand that he firmly rejects evolution but then say things that basically are in line with the theory of evolution. I kind of piece things together though in my conversations with him by noting a couple of things:\n\n1)He seemed to associate Darwinism with atheism or a rejection of belief in God. Consequently he seemed to associate creationism with just affirming God's existence in even a generic belief in the Bible. This was shown to me by the fact that when American creationists came to our Church in Canada(i use to be evangelical before leaving and joining Anglicanism) I blatant said I wouldn't be participating in the conference they were holding because I thought it was nonsense. This started an argument and I basically said there is no basis for insisting the earth is 6000 yrs old. At that point he said \"who said the earth was 6000 yrs?\". I respond \"the creationists.....\" and he said \"Are you sure that's their position\" and I was like \"Yeah....it is\". He didn't know creationism went beyond \"just believe in God\" to \"affirm a young earth\" because the North American culture wars wasn't something he paid attention to on certain issues, nor was he interested in.\n\n2)He seemed to associate Darwinism with racism. And this background is kinda understandable when I thought of it. Because his family would have grown up under British colonialism and its aftermath. One of the things the British used to justify the colonisation of the planet, including many parts of the Caribbean was scientific racism. You add on top of this the cut throat, survival of the fittest monopoly capitalism that was practised in the developing world by Western leaders that weaponised social darwinism and you have the background of my Fathers rejection of Darwin. It seems largely political and social and even the religious part has a social element(even though he doesn't even recognise it). Because his understanding of Christianity was one that defended the poor(because he was poor) and in a Caribbean context fought against the enslavement of people of color because in Jamaica(where we are from) some of the national heroes invoked the rhetoric of Christianity to fight for independence as well as the abolition of slavery(like a Liberation theology). He sees Darwins ideology as being against that and being a contributor to the racist and imperialistic systems that he grew up being very critical of. All of this is interesting because when you circle back to the atheism point, he had no problem studying other thinkers and leaders who might be \"atheistic\" like Marx, Che Guevara and others because despite their atheism which he would have disagreed with(though he didn't care that much about interestingly) their critiques of the systems he was against such as cut throat capitalism, racism, or colonialism jived with his understanding of Christianity. So his reasoning is....complex.",

Several students used church and the cross as examples. \n\nWell, today a student did a presentation on Rudolf Otto.. his presentation mentioned ‚Äúnuminous‚Äù and something about ‚Äúmysterium tremendum‚Äù‚Ä¶ I know it‚Äôs like an experience of some sort but he used an example of looking in nature or a sunset and being in ‚Äúawe‚Äù.. how is that a religious experience? I‚Äôve done that before but I don‚Äôt feel close to god or nature. (Maybe that‚Äôs just me though) I thought a religious experience were when people start seizing on the floor and speak tongues or when they go to church and pray‚Ä¶ I apologize if I offend anyone with my words, I just can‚Äôt process some of these concepts. I feel like everything deserves an explanation. \n\nTLDR: I‚Äôm taking religion 101 and I don‚Äôt understand what Mr Eliade and Mr Otto are saying about religion, or maybe I‚Äôm just overthinking.",

        "text": "Hi everyone üòäüëãüèº\n\nI would love to hear different perspectives and see different point of views about a current situation I am dealing with. A close friend of mine we will call him Robert, is currently going through quite a bit of hardship as he has been cheated on 4-5 or even more times by his wife.  Currently  he has discovered that she has gone back to the same guy she was just caught with back in August. \n\nRobert has been all of his faith in god as he is distraught and not sure what to do but has concluded that he wants to stay with her and is just praying that god will change her. \n\nTo add some context, I am new-er to the Christian religion but always thought adultery was a big no no and so divorce would be justified. \n\nBut he does not believe that, and believes that the guy his wife cheated on him with, must have some sort of demons and witchcraft involved to keep luring his wife back in. (please keep in mind his wife has a tendency of cheating over there past 15+ year marriage/ there have been many instances)  \n\nTo make matters worse, Roberts wife has told Robert she wants to leave him for the other guy. Robert believes demons and witch craft is behind this.\n\nOf course I respect any decision he ends up making but I do not want to see him hurt again by this. And also I believe that there is temptation all around us but we should know better than to give into those temptations and commit sin. \n\nI just would like to hear other perspectives on this as his way of thinking really does perplex me.",

That they would be selfish by nature for not having children, while being a little too old to start having them.\n\nThat made me think about whether or not it actually is selfish to not have children, and what the various religions say on that matter. Do we have a responsibility to have children, if not for our nation or religion then perhaps for our family/bloodline? What does your religion say on this topic?",
