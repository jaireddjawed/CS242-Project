Ahn thought as Ahn started gaining on the opposing racers left back tire\n\n“**It’s not looking good for Glyphic in his Toyota speedster!**” \n\nAhn slammed into the car spinning it out , and eventually rolling\n\n“Ha! All that cash and glitzy paint for nothing!” \n\nAhn focused and pushed passed the majority of drivers with ease weaving in and out until he was in the top 6 , not bad but he *wanted* top 5 but he **needed** first place and lap two was coming up quickly \n\nAhn spoke quickly \n\n“Chu, I’ve got an idea for first, give me clearance for the early Omni booster!” \n\n“Why is it *every* time you fook the start of the race you come up with some batshit plan?” \n\n“Because it all pans out in the end you grumpy asshole”\n\n*Dun dun duuuuuuuuuun*\n\nThe light for the omnibooster turned  green and Ahn immediately hits it the pressure hits him again \n\n“**AHN KANSPEED PULLS OUT AN UNEXPECTED FIRST LAP BOOST!**”\n\n*dun dun dun duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun*\nThe music building up to the climax , and Ahn feels it, the g forces , the music , the rubber, and the crowd as he surges past the other racers clenching an extremely narrow first*this is everything he loves about racing* \n\n“**WATCH!**”\n\nAhn yells as he flips the comms open to all \n\n“**THIS IS GONNA BE HOT!!!!!!**”\n\nThe music hits its climax as Ahn hits second lap, and he readies himself for the clothesline he’s about to give a few of these guys\n\n**the cab of the mustang shifts vertically arms spring out of the side**\n\nA soft machine voice chimes \n\n“Centaur mode engaged, tier one weapons available”\n\n“No need right now baby, got something else in mind” \n\nAhn sets the robots arms parallel to the ground the same time as de drastically slows down from the boost wearing off and narrowly being in first catches 3 racers off guard they crash violently \n\nAhn smiles, now it gets serious...",

I had seen most of them already, but a few I hadn’t including Strange Days (released in 1995 set at the end of 1999).

What’s the point. The economy sucks. Gas is over 3 bucks a gallon. 5 grade kids are shooting each other at recess.”\n\nI paused it to write this post - back to watching it.",
