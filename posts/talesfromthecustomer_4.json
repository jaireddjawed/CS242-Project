Thanks to this I’ve never really gotten bad service, but my run-in with this one cashier was so amazing I had to share! \n\nI had just gotten off work one afternoon and I needed to go pick up groceries before heading home, so I went to a popular grocery store in Canada that was just across the street from my job. I was mostly picking up produce etc, and I noticed there was some deals going on but it isn’t my usual grocery store so I didn’t pay much attention. \n\nI grabbed everything I needed and headed to the checkout. When I got to the front, the cashier glanced over everything I was buying. She asked if I had a rewards card because I could get a lot of savings with it. I told her I didn’t, and she immediately offered for me to use hers. She then went out of her way to go talk to her manager to get permission etc, used her employee card for me and ended up saving me $20 all out of the goodness of her heart! I thanked her profusely and left with a huge smile on my face. So, wonderful cashier, thank you for making my day!  \n",

        "text": "The hair salon I usually go to went out of business, so I tried a new place this weekend. Mostly it seemed like a nice place, and the stylist was knowledgeable and friendly. But a couple of things seemed off to me, and I can't make up my mind if it's enough to not go back.\n\nFirst, and this is rather small, but when she washed my hair she used some product that smelled *really strongly* of tea tree oil. I love tea tree so no big deal, but I've never had a stylist use something with such a strong smell, and I know lots of people *don't* like tea tree, so it seems like a strange thing to surprise you with.\n\nThen she started asking me about whether I do anything with my eyebrows (they offer a couple different things), and I said I don't and that I honestly hardly even wear makeup, but I'm trying to learn. Keep in mind that I'm still at the shampoo station with my head in the sink. She'd just finished washing my hair, but hadn't gotten a towel yet. She walked away and came back with some eyebrow makeup (similar to mascara), and starts putting it on me! I was too surprised to say anything, and to be fair I may have even seemed to be encouraging because I was interested and asking questions, but that's weird, right? To just start applying makeup to someone's face without warning? Worse, I'm pretty sure she didn't use a disposable applicator! Like she just used the one that comes with it, and after rubbing it on my eyebrows, she put it back in the bottle!\n\nWhat do you think? Is that bad enough to not go back, or is it more like next time just be prepared to stop her?",

        "text": "This is a story about the spring break trip I took with some friends a few months ago. FTP LTL OM. All that jazz. \n\nSo my friends and I were all getting an airBnB in Daytona, Florida. Since it would’ve been about a 12 hour drive, we flew down. Obviously, this wouldn’t be a story if everything went well, so the drama begins on the runway. \n\nI am flying with my good friend James - the rest of our group is meeting us down in Florida. James and I are pumped, sitting next to each other on the plane, about to crack some celebratory airplane shots we snuck on when we hear it: “**Attention passengers. There is a mechanical issue with the place and we need to disembark.**” We get off the plane and this is where the fun starts. James and I are in basically the exact same situation with a key difference: I’ve worked in customer service so I am experienced with charming the middle aged women that run the world, no matter how terrible the situation is. James is a fiery redhead that lets the whole world know when he is pissed. \n\nI’ll sum up how our situations diverged and see if you can glean a moral to the story. \n\nI call into the complaint like and explain that I understand how these things happen, but it would mean a lot of the airline could offer me a token of their apology so keep my customer loyalty. I am rewarded with a few hundred dollars in airline credit. \n\nJames calls in pissed and demands restitution. He is told that because it is a mechanical failure, it isn’t covered by the airline (or something of this nature). He is left empty handed. \n\nI go up to the customer service desk with an award winning smile and make pleasant chit-chat while the worker tries to figure out a replacement flight. She puts me on a first class seat on an otherwise fully booked flight in an hour. \n\nJames goes up and tells her about just how shitty an airline they’re running. He comes back with an economy seat leaving in two hours. \n\nHis flight ends up leaving early, so we basically end up at our layover at the same time. We both rush to our departure gate to try to get onto a flight to Daytona, our final destination. There’s a line of about a dozen people trying to get a no-show seat. Once again, with a tight shirt and a friendly smile, I approach the ticket agent. She says that the line for no show seats is backed up, but she insists that she remembers talking to me earlier and saved me a seat. I decide to not look a gift horse in the mouth and graciously accept the offer from my new best friend. \n\nJames gets put on a flight several hours later. I offered to stay and wait with him, but there was no guarantee of an extra seat on that flight so I leave promising to have cold beer in the fridge by the time he arrives. \n\nMoral of the story? Smile and charm. Middle age women run airports. \n",

And no matter what shoes I wear, tiny tiny stones collect in the grips and as I walk into work, walk out, step into car, and they gradually fall out. So my driving and passenger seat is littered with dirt, pebbles, stones etc all the time. \n\nI’m also 7 months pregnant and starting to experience dizzy spells whenever I bend over so I did what I could as a pre-clean,  but this car needed a professional. \n\nSo the car wash guys (about 5) start up their industrial looking vacuum - and for a good ten minutes it rattles with the sound of stones and other debris getting sucked up. Man I feel bad. I know it’s their job but the sound really emphasised how much crap could accumulate over time. \n\nI’m the only customer, in the waiting room which is right next to where my car is so I can hear everything and it was a Friday night- these guys thought they were on the final furlong for home and then I brought in a car with half a quarry stored in it! \n\nI felt so bad. I’m the kind of person who doesn’t like being waited on; if I can/should do it myself I will. I did a DIY wedding and it was the vendors I had no control over that stressed me out more (will the flowers arrive on time? Will the band be able to get to the venue? What if the elevator breaks?)\n\nThen they called in three more guys from somewhere to help! So now eight guys are now frantically trying to clean the windows, wash down the floor mats, and the vacuum is still going strong with the mess! \n\nWhen I got the car back they had also unearthed underneath the seats;\n\nChocolate bars I had bought six months ago but went missing as soon as I left the shop and had assumed at the time I forgot to pack. They obviously fell out and slipped under a seat and I just accepted they were gone forever.\n\nA soft drink from last year which has since changed the recipe and whilst out of date, is still sought after because the low sugar version available now is hated by fans.\n\nA pair of sunglasses that belonged to my grandad who passed away last month. \n\n\nEventually the vacuum stopped, and one of the guys came over, (I can’t remember if he wiped his brow and let out an exhaustive sigh, my guilt ridden memory would probably say yes.) and said they were finished and it would be £XX. I gave them double, said thank you and waddled as quickly as I could out of there. \n\nThey did a great job, the car is immaculate, but dang I need to work on my social skills and not feel bad when I’m paying for a service. Hopefully they put the tip towards something nice, \n",

We end up with the same waitress as last time. Upon sitting down, we get our menus and drinks and then she comes over. She straight up asks me “Hey did I do something wrong last time you were here? You didn’t tip me.” I was stunned.

        "text": "Another post that I read urged me to post this positive experience I had just a few days ago, on August 13th\n\nLast week, I finished packing up my apartment and getting ready to move back to my home state. I was to be traveling alone with a disabled child (my daughter has cerebral palsy), several heavy checked bags, a diaper bag, stroller, car seat, breast pump bag, breast milk bag, and backpack. This is no easy feat, as it can take forever and a day to get through security. They have to x-ray all of those items, individually test every single breast milk bottle and every baby food container. \n\nI finally made it through check in and security, and was looking forward to relaxing, feeding my child, and getting myself together at the gate. However as soon as I got there, I was informed by other passengers that the flight was extremely delayed due to bad weather on the east coast. I was discouraged. I have had so many bad experiences while traveling. It seems like every flight I have ever been scheduled to take has been delayed or cancelled. Last year, I was cancelled three times in a row. I gathered all of my luggage (which was more than I could handle to begin with) and made my way to the desk where an employee was attempting to help the passengers ascertain whether or not they would be making their connection flight. I geared up for an unpleasant confrontation, another conversation with an unpleasantly monotonous and inconsiderate airline employee. That was not the case at all. \n\nWhen it was my turn to speak to the employee, she was immediately friendly. She apologized profusely for the inconvenience, and informed me that due to the delay I would miss my connecting flight. She also informed me that the next available flight out of the connecting airport to my destination wasn’t until 20 hours later. Being that I was traveling with a limited food supply and a disabled child, this was not going to work for me. She took me completely by surprise when she told me to come behind the desk with her, so that I could look at her computer. She continued to show me as she went through every possible option for me, and helped me decide on a flight for the next day. She re-routed us through a different airport, so that I would be able to get home sooner. Even though my lowly basic economy status didn’t include this, she allowed me to pick a seat for both flights the next day so that my daughter and I could be more comfortable. She spent a long time helping me figure out our situation, and she was so kind , accommodating, and understanding the whole time. She found someone to help me back out with my bags, and the next day when I was actually able to fly out, she helped my daughter and I pre-board. All with a smile on her face. \n\nMy usual experience with the airlines and their employees is that they don’t care how much you are inconvenienced, as long as they can make as much money off of you as possible. She was truly a good surprise , and I made sure to leave her a great review. Her attitude and kindness made a bad situation so much easier for me. \n",

I got to the train station to get to my pre booked flight. Then I was hit with signs, no trains today between x and x, replacement bus service in action today. Oh crap. I hadn’t left more than an extra hour to spare at the airport. I started to freak out but was told that the bus was only for part of the journey and it probably wouldn’t take that much longer. So I get on the train and head out. I get to the station where the bus part is suppose to happen and I start freaking out. It took 30 minutes just for the bus to arrive. I call the airline number and told them what was happening they told me I could change to a flexible fare for £300quid. I told them that was impossible. I didn’t have the money. I was broke. They said they couldn’t keep the gate open for me I’d just have to try to get there on time. \n\nAnother hour goes by and I know now. There is no way I’m getting to the airport in time. I call up again. I tell them the same thing I told the first person. I can’t afford the change of flight. It’s too expensive. I can’t afford to go back on the train. I don’t know what I’ll do. They tell me to hold on, maybe I’ll make it. \n\nSo the bus finally arrives at the airport. I leg it into the airport. And there is a queue for check in. I try as politely as I can to get to the front. But the other passengers think their check in is more important than mine. I finally get to the front, tell the lady I’m for the 3pm flight and the lady tells me my plane has actually departed. I mutter thanks and walk away. I find a small space devoid of people in the airport and start crying. I’m stuck, I feel completely helpless. I don’t know what to do. I had done the right thing, I called them up, but no I was going to be stuck in the airport. After about 20 minutes, I steal myself and head up to the passenger desk. I explain my predicament, expecting to be facing a huge bill for a new ticket, that I couldn’t afford. \n\nThe guy asks me for my booking reference. I give it to him and he looks confused for a second. I stare up at him expecting him to tell me there is nothing he can do unless I can pay for a new flight. He says “well your ticket got changed. You are on the 6pm flight. You can go check in now”  I stood there shocked, I nearly burst into a new puddle of tears. One of the nice people on the phone must have changed my ticket for me for free. I thanked him a million times and ran to check in. I wasn’t going to argue. ",

        "text": "I went out to dinner at a local restaurant chain known for their wings. At the beginning, as soon as we sat down, our waitress was prompt, friendly, and extremely helpful. \n\nWhen it came time to order, I ordered one of their specialty wing flavors. Our waitress apologized, saying they had run out of that flavor. She then suggested another specialty flavor. The flavor combination sounded strange, but I usually enjoy unusual foods, so I told her I would try it. \n\nSo, everything is going fine, our drinks are refilled promptly, our appetizer comes out fairly quick and is delicious, and our waitress was great. But then, when I received my wings with the specialty flavor, I took one bite, and I couldn’t stomach anymore. The flavor was not good at all. I knew it wasn’t the waitress’s fault, so I just pushed the wings to the side and munched on the appetizer instead.\n\nThe waitress came by to ask how everything was, and at that time, I told her that I wasn’t really a fan of the flavor. She apologized, saying she loves that flavor, and asked if I wanted a new dish or a dessert. At that point, I didn’t feel like waiting for more food to come out, and I was filling up on the appetizer, so I politely declined. It was at this point that she suddenly did a full 180 on us and started getting rude. Gone was our peppy and friendly waitress. \n\nShe kept repeating that she loves that flavor, and even pressured my boyfriend into trying it. He wasn’t interested and told her he didn’t want to try it. She kept pushing and asked if he was declining because he was afraid to try it. At that point, he just gave in and took a bit of one of my wings, just so she would stop pushing. She walked away from our table for a couple minutes while he was trying my wings. My boyfriend also did not like the flavor. He said the flavor combination just didn’t work. Well, our waitress comes back and asks what he thought. He told her he also didn’t like the flavor. She got very defensive, and said, well the kitchen must have not made it with love today or something, as she scooped up the container of wings to take away from the table. She apologized again, but said it very sarcastically, and told us once again how good she thought the flavor was. Then she told us that in the future, we can always test the flavors ahead of time to avoid this happening again. I told her, I would definitely do that next time, and I had no idea that they even offered sampling of their flavors. She just stood there for a moment, and repeated herself, that next time we need to just ask to sample the flavor ahead of time. We just told her that it was fine, we weren’t upset, and it was no big deal. \n\nShe comes back shortly after with our check, drops it off wordlessly, and leaves quickly. We look at the check, and we were fully charged for everything. We were a little annoyed, since I didn’t eat the wings at all, but we didn’t say anything, and we just left a smaller tip than normal. (Not much lower, it was like 18% when we normally tip 20%).  \n\nMy boyfriend and I were baffled by her change in attitude so quickly over something that I considered to be so trivial. It seemed like she wanted to convince us that the flavor was wonderful, and we were wrong for not liking it. Oh well, I guess not all dining experience are going to be perfect. ",

        "text": "TL;DR  Friendly tire store guys help me out for free not just once, but twice, and, I find out that a minor problem with my car is way cheaper to fix than I had been told at another place.\n\nI have a 21st century car that has tire pressure sensors.  The car is old enough that it's to be expected that some things are going to wear out, especially maybe the bells and whistles.  Maybe three years ago I got two new tires, and went back to the shop because I thought they  hadn't re-set the pressure sensors.  I wouldn't say I was a \"regular\" at this particular store, but I would say that over the course of about 20 years, I had bought about 80% of all my tires over three vehicles from this particular shop.  Just habit.\n\nThe tech I talked to told me that the pressure sensors had broken (as in, she said sensors and I assumed she was telling me \"all of them.\"  My recollection is that she told me they would cost something like $120 each to replace.  I didn't feel like I had to have them, so I have lived with a \"tire pressure sensor failure\" warning on my dash since then.\n\nLast fall, I failed to notice that my left front tire (driver's side for USA roads) had gone low, and I ended up driving on it, ruining the tire AND the wheel.\n\nFast forward to this week.  I noticed that I was now receiving a \"tire pressure low\" warning.  \"That's odd,\" I think, because all the sensors are broken.  I just figured it was probably some little computer glitch.  At the time, I did walk all the way around the car and all tires seemed fine.\n\nSo yesterday afternoon I'm downtown for a couple of hours meeting with friends at a restaurant, and when I get back to my car I see that the right rear wheel is WAY low (this is lucky because I don't necessarily always look at the right side of my car; the fact that I noticed it was because of the peculiar spot I was parked in this one time.\n\nIt's pretty late in the afternoon for getting that kind of thing fixed, 5:30 in the afternoon.  My plan:  go to a gasoline station and put some air in the tire (had been seeing this tire pressure warning for like 3 days so I figured it was a slow leak).  I know just the station.  Not far to drive at all.\n\n...which, when I get there, has an \"out of order\" sign on it.\n\nOK, I can think of two more stations between where I am and my place.  The second one is a much bigger station, right off the interstate highway.  It's kind of out of my way but it's not too far.  I really don't like driving on a tire that low.\n\nI get there, and I have to drive around the building a couple of times to spot the air pump, which when I pull up to it, has a quarter stuck right in the slot for the quarters.  I bang on it a couple of times to no avail.\n\nOK, so I am now thinking of one more gas station I might get some air from.   I'm driving slowly and cautiously.  Quickest way back to my place is to get onto the interstate but I'm def not doing that with one squishy tire.  So I'm taking the \"back way\", and as I'm getting close to the final gas station possibility, I notice there on the right, \"BigOle' Tirez!\"  All there service bay doors are open and guys are working.\n\nSo I pull up to an empty bay, roll down the window, and asks they guy if he could shoot some air in my left rear.  \"Sure, pull on up!\"  I do, he fills the tire, and then checks the other three.  I ask him if he thinks the right rear is all right.  \n\n\"Let me look.\"  So he tells me to back up a little bit, twice, and then he stands up and says, \"You've got a nail.\"\n\n\"Do you think I can bring it back? \"  As I'm asking this, I offer him a $5 for a tip.  He starts to take it, but then hesitates and asks, \"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Absolutely,\" I tell him.  \n\n\"Yeah, we open at 7 in the morning.  You should be good 'till then.\n\nI walk in their doors at 7:10 and get signed in.  They're busy but not swamped.  They get my car in the bay after about 30 minutes maybe, and I don't hear anything for a while which I take as good news since the tire is probably fixable.  Finally the guy calls me up.\n\nFirst he shows me a diagnostic read-out showing that, of the four tire pressure sensors, only one wasn't working, on the left front (the tire/wheel that I ruined last fall.)  Then he tells me I can get one anytime for $60, half of what the previous place had quoted.\n\nThen he shows me my invoice: $0.00.  I ABSOLUTELY DID NOT expect this, I figured they'd charge me something like $15-$25 for putting it up on the rack/lift, and I think that would have been reasonable.\n\nThe *only* thing I was *kind* of unhappy about is that he didn't come in while my car was still up on the rack and tell me about the option to replace the sensor.  I had something else to do and didn't want to get back in line to get it taken care of.  I'll do it soon.\n\nNow, I'm not at all sure whether the previous tire place just didn't have as much gear/sophistication as BigOle'Tirez did and didn't actually check to see just exactly how many of the sensors had failed, or if the tech was actually fishing for a $500 fix for stuff that didn't need nearly that much fixing, but I know which tire store I *won't* be going back to!\n\nThanks, BigOle'Tirez!",

We were disgusted and called the waitress over. She apologized and took his salad away, getting him a fresh one.\n\nI, however, was really grossed out. \n\nMe: I don’t really think I can eat my salad now. I’m afraid there might be something in there...\n\nWaitress: Well, if you like, I could bring you another bowl and you could dump your salad in there so that you can check and make sure there isn’t anything in there.\n\nMe:.......\n\nI was totally flabbergasted by this suggestion. You want me to pick through my salad and make sure there aren’t any bugs in it? Really?\n\n\nThe manager also came over to “Check and make sure everything is ok.” He explained that these kinds of things happen sometimes. (Really??) He asked what they could do to fix it. \n\nSeriously, I did not feel comfortable asking for free food, but I think that’s what they should have done. His meal should have been comped, or at least a free dessert or SOMETHING. \n\nInstead, we got nothing and didn’t go back to that restaurant again.",

        "text": "FTP; just discovered this and figured ya'll might enjoy. Full disclosure, this story happened at a popular chain store in the U.S. about twenty years ago. Said store has since gone out of business, but I'll leave it anonymous in the interest of not stepping on toes. Hopefully, such issues are rarer nowadays, but I never endured retail training so... I wouldn't know.  Also, I wasn't there for this (being a kid who my parents were shopping for), but the story has been shared multiple times and is supported by other members of tiny hometown, so I trust the validity entirely.\n\nTL;DR - Cashier overwhelmed by Christmas rush and (arguably) complicated math tries to give my parents the deal of a lifetime on their last minute gifts.\n\nSo, like I said, this is many, many years ago, and, my parents had gotten themselves behind on Christmas shopping. They bit the bullet and went to aforementioned chain store to try and catch up. There were a number of \"end of the year\" sales going on, (you know, like 10% off jewelry, 15% off certain brand women's apparel, that sort of thing). To make things even more confusing, my parents had a large family with a significant age gap between the kiddos. Think the youngest is still a toddler and therefore gets an age-appropriate toy while the oldest is in her late teens and gets some perfume. As a consequence to this, when my parents came up to the register, they had a gambit of gifts with all kinds of different sales tagged on them. \n\nNow, in cashier's defense, there were a number of odds stacked against her. One, she had just opened her register and the line is already about ten deep with the other clerks just as backed up. Two, this is a relatively small town and she was a not only a new face but a **young** face - implying she was most likely relatively fresh from training. Three, this was late in the evening during Christmas week. All those facts had to be stressful enough on their own, my parents' huge purchase selection - all with different markdowns - probably didn't help matters.\n\nSo, she grabs the first item, scans it, and mumbles something under her breath as she types up some numbers on her keypad. My parents are waiting patiently as she repeats the process for all the items until finally, she reads them their total. My folks are stunned. Somehow, this lady has rung everything up to the tune of shorting the store several hundred dollars. Mom shakes her head, and, being a conscientious sort, tries to explain that something isn't right. Cashier insists that it is. Dad asks to look at the screen where she's wrung everything up, thinking that maybe she mis-scanned a few of the higher-dollar items. He reads through everything, which seems to be in order, until he realizes the discount she's applied. Instead of applying discounts to each item (10% off jewelry, 15% off clothing), she's **added** all of the discounts together and applied it to the whole order. So, 10% off this, plus 15% off that, 25% off the other thing, and so on until she's concluded that **every item in my folk's cart is 80% off.** \n\nDad is an engineer by trade, very used to dealing with large complicated numbers. He tries valiantly to explain to this woman why this is such a no-no, but now she's getting offended. She's going to college in town to be a teacher. She understands math just fine. She then tries to walk my dad through her math - 15% + 25% + 10% + 30% = 80%. Dad agrees, these numbers do in fact add up to 80, but that's not the problem. She cannot get it through her head, and is getting more and more offended. \n\nThe back of the line is starting to grumble about what's taking so long while people close enough to hear the issue are looking at each other trying to decide if they should switch lines or stick around in hopes of getting up to 80% off their purchases. Mom is getting desperate, and Dad is getting **nowhere**. Finally, they ask if maybe they could talk to a manager to settle this, and the woman flips her lid. Somewhere in the angry rant it slips that the manager is attending to other (implied, more important) matters, so it will take some time. \n\nMom and Dad get their purchases set aside and sit on a nearby bench to wait for the manager. Mom takes out her phone to call home, where her oldest kiddos are babysitting the littler ones, to explain the situation, and the next lady in line asks the cashier a question. Seems she's already added up all of the markdowns in her cart and it comes up to 75%. She asks if she were to continue shopping and get a few other items, whether the discount would be applied to the new items as well. Cashier confirms and shoots my parents a smug look (*see, someone* ***else*** *gets it!),* and the woman, utterly delighted, goes to get more highly discounted merchandise. \n\nMy parents shake their heads and watch helplessly as the cashier continues to make the same mistake. After a few hours, the manager still hadn't shown, and Mom couldn't bring herself to leave us kiddos alone any longer (in her defense - we could be destructive on occasion). So, Mom and Dad walked out, without their presents. They returned later and purchased the gifts from a different cashier for the correct price.",

I only started my business four or so months ago, and it’s going really well, but every penny still counts! \nAnyway, I usually go to the floral market to grab pots and vessels and sometimes last-minute plants that I forgot to get at the greenhouse. The market is set up like a long huge outside hallway, with parking spaces in the middle. At the very end of the market there’s a shop that sells pots and vessels. Now, plenty of other shops in the marketplace sell pots, and they all have a similar inventory. While this shop’s prices are a tiny bit higher, the shop guy is such a sweet chatty older guy who’s always so fun to talk to that I can’t help but go in there. \nToday, I was explaining to him how my old job (i was the buyer for a plant shop so I frequented his shop, that’s how we became buds) had gone out of business and I had started my own business, which I realized I hadn’t told him until today. He congratulated me and we chatted on, and I ended up pulling about 50-60 dollars worth of pots. \nWe get to the register and he says “okay! Have a good day!” And looks at my card and shakes his head. “Really?! No way” I say to him. He then says it’s okay, and how it’s hard to start a business in this city, and how it’s his congratulatory present to me. \nDamn, I was touched. it’s such hard work starting this company and honestly nobody else at the flower market (especially older people) has shown that much faith in me, assumingely because of my young age/appearance, so this was a huge deal to me. I’m still so overwhelmed by the kindness, so I thought I’d share! \n\nDevelop a casual friendship with the retail workers in your life, not only is it rewarding on a social level but who knows, they may even gift you some free goodies from time to time!!!!

I just shuffled out.\n\nSince then, in the same situation, I've got my act together, and now directly say \"I want to leave a tip, but I've only got large notes. Are you able to give me change for a twenty?\"",

        "text": "Fuck you. Now, on with the story \n\nSo I had just finished watching the new movie “The Meg” at my local theater. I had purchased my tickets using a website and went to the movies. Now usually in the hallway there is someone standing there waiting to collect or scan the tickets, no one was there today so I walk in and sit in the theater. The movie ends and as I’m leaving the manager came up and pulled me and my friends aside and says “did you buy tickets?” I said “yes I got them on (insert website here) it’s on my phone” the manager then goes “well if you can’t show the tickets I’ll have to phone the police” so keep in mind I’m freaking out so i pull my phone out and I’m on 1X (no signal) and can’t access the site to redeem my QR Code so I explain the situation, and none of my friends can get theirs up either as the theater is in a weakzone. The theater then forced us all to buy tickets to the movie AANNDD pay a 5.00$ fee for “movie hopping” I just payed, left and never looked back. I am so frustrated the manager didn’t even give us a chance to speak and he was yelling at the employee and was saying he was gonna get him fired, I felt so bad for the toxic workplace the poor guy had worked at. I’m currently in contact with the supervising company that owns the theater to try and work something out. Just a very frustrating day to something as simple as watching a movie.",

        "text": "I've been largely estranged from my immediate family for a lot of years, but several of them are vacationing in the town where I live, so we're spending a few days together. Last night we dined at a well-known mostly-breakfast chain -- my brothers \"Dick\" and \"Donnie,\" along with their wives and our mother and me -- and I was flabbergasted at my brothers' behavior. \n\nMy brother \"Dick\" was too loud and very abrupt with the waitress, changed his mind several times about what he was ordering *while* he was ordering, and demanded very little ice in his soda -- three times. When his soda came it had far less ice than anyone else's, but still too much for my brother, and he spent a few minutes loudly complaining about \"too much ice, why do they always give me too much ice?,\" within earshot of the waitress and in a restaurant he'd never been to before. My sister-in-law and I tried to calm and quiet him, but Dick took a handful of ice from his drink and was going to plop it on the carpet. \n\nI should mention, we're not teenagers. Far from it. We're all in our 60s and our mother is almost 90. My brothers both have grandchildren. The rest of our party, along with a polite but perplexed busboy, convinced my brother to put his \"too much ice\" in a doggy-box instead of on the floor, and I said, \"You know, *this kind of crap* is why you haven't seen me in twenty years.\"\n\nAfter that, our table was mostly well-behaved albeit a little too loud, and we agreed to have just one ticket and settle up afterwards. I left ten bucks tip under the plate for my $15 meal, and it wasn't until we split the tab the next morning that my other brother -- not Dick, who'd complained about the ice, but Donnie, our more level-headed and reasonable brother -- made fun of me for tipping. And at that point I figured out that I was the only one who'd tipped.\n\nSo I want to apologize for my brother, and my other brother. Our table was too loud, one of us was out of line, and we tipped just $10 on a $75 ticket. My wife and I eat at this place fairly often, and I'll be embarrassed to go back, but the next time we have that waitress I'm tipping the total tab.",

        "text": "As title suggests, I have been dealing with a useless bills management company for close to a year now.\n\nSo here goes.\n\nMoved into a new uni house back in August 2017, and the old tenants had been using one of these bills management companies that collates all your bills, splits them between housemates, chucks on a fee, then bills each housemate. \n\nWhen we got the keys to this house, I stupidly didn't contact this company for about a month, so accrued some charges on the account, fine. Once I had contacted our new company (another splitting thing, don't ask) they started the process of closing the account with the old place. This kicks off a chain reaction of speaking to both call centres, sometimes for hours a day, to try and settle up any outstanding charges on the account.\n\nAfter roughly 2 months, I received an email from old company saying I had ~£200 outstanding on the account, from the one month period we were with them. \n\nI knew this was wrong, so contacted them, resubmitted the meter readings from the necessary dates (for the third time) and was told the bill was now £46. \n\nAfter having a conversation with some bloke at the other end, he said that after this payment the account will be closed and no further action will need to be taken. So I paid.\n\nFast forward roughly 6 months, I get an email from a debt collection agency, on behalf of said company, for the original amount of ~£200. I chose to ignore it, as I thought it may have been slow working on their part. \n\nTwo more months passed, and another email came in. Bear in mind they had no personal information on me (no name) other than the email they were contacting me on. So I replied to their email, with a wide array of information pertaining to the matter.\n\nI also emailed bills company, with roughly 10-15 points of information, including rough dates and payment amounts, and politely (not so much) asked them to stop contacting me, and to call off the hounds.\n\nFast forward to today, and have had, to my knowledge, no further contact from either company, other than an email from debt agency, will a copy paste of the first and second email.\n\nWhat's with this? Can I be safe in the knowledge that this isn't going to affect my credit file? Can I continue on as if the last year didn't happen? \n\nTL; Dr: bills company demanding false amount of money. Get amount changed, pay off and close account. Debt collection agency still contacting me. What do?\n\n(Sorry for long post and/or editing, on mobile)",

Owner overreacted and kicks them out.\n\nBackstory: I run a rental property that helps produce digital media for students/small biz/or whomever.\n\nWe get a pair of projects that need a location and crew to film. They are students and desperately need help.\n\nThe first project needs help acquiring a cast and crew--everything goes fine with that. \n\nSo two weeks go by and I don't hear anything from the lead producer of the second project. \n\nHowever I had been communicating to a project lead (also known as our point of contact (P.O.C.) about everything we were doing and the charges for our services that applied--heavily discounted for the students. However, as time goes on, a shoot day is not reserved and logistics aren't even finalized. \nApparently the Project Lead would continuously cancel meetings.\n\nThat was Wednesday of last week.\n\nThursday: they show up with gear that piled up and took over my rental space, causing me to cancel an event. \n\nThey drop their gear off and leave. No notice or prior approval and inform me they will be here Sunday to film. (Couldnt talk, an Uber was waiting... bullshit) I inform her this is not ideal but I will stay up with the P.O.C.\n\nFriday: we start construction of the contracted props and spend $100 in supplies and a the rest of our weekend building. They looked good, and worked properly and we had the go ahead from the client.\n\nSaturday: we finalize our construction get it to the studio and start setting up. That's when we get a call from our P.O.C. She had quit and is no longer part of the project.\n\nShitty!\nO well life goes on, I still work. I get an email from the Project Lead with a half-assed excuse about how our P.O.C. and her \"heart were too close to it\" and asked if we could update her on the progress. \n\nI take the time and compile everything we talked about and the agreed upon invoice. (&lt;$350). I inform them that they have 30 days to pay and we can do a payment plan, as well as work off the debt.\n\nSunday morning: I wake up to an email detailing how what I'm doing is not legal, she will be getting a lawyer and will be over to use our space regardless of what we think. Okayyy....?\n\nShit goes down. The owner decided to not respond and wait for them. The project lead and the entire crew shows up late and starts to take over.\n\nNow, what happened next is not my bosses best moment so I hope all you aspiring business owners take heed.\n\nBefore we started he asked the lead to sit down while starting to explain to her that he hadn't signed the waiver yet and she can't film until they settle this.\n\nWell, a mix of \"You don't have the right/I'm getting a layer\", yells on top of  \"Get your shit and get out\" shouts deteriorated into a cluster fuck of threats, tears and the claim that our company stole/rips off/ harassed her crew and are unprofessional. The threat of a negative Yelping was responded with a cold \"no one fucking cares about what you think\" from our owner. Too much? \n\n20 minutes later they finally start moving gear out but not without tossing one line attempts to burn me, my partner or our employees. Fine, it's all they got.\n\nMuch credit to the Project lead's life partner. With a cool head and weapons of logic, she and I talked about the situation and came to the conclusion that it was a mix of miscommunication and inexperience from the project's leads.\n\nI the finacial manager and my business partner (I fronted the money to build the props) decided to offer the pre- built components as a peace offering. They left and now we wait.\n\nWe will still work with students but we are adjusting our parameters.",

        "text": "So two months ago, I decided to be an adult and stop paying my cousin to have me on his phone plan. I paid him per month, but was sick of having to ask him permission to do things regarding my phone (insurance, etc) plus he said he’s considering leaving the company we use. But I digress. \n\nI was ready to get rid of my phone (two year old robot phone) and purchased an unlocked refurbished fruit phone outright. Plan was to turn in robot phone to cover what I owe on it, and transfer my phone number and line onto my own plan using the fruit phone. He was down, made all the calls necessary to do so. Good to go. \n\nI go into the store, do the thing, the dude is very nice so it all goes well. Or so I thought. He asked if I wanted my trade in value on a visa or as credit toward my account, I was hoping it would cover what I owed but I had to pay that right then was what I was told, and the trade in value had to be visa of credit. Ok, fine, I chose credit to my account. I was told it would take a few cycles to show up, also fine.\n\n\nFast forward two months, I do not have the $70 in my account still. Weird. Call customer service, they tell me I have to talk to the store directly. So I go in. \n\n\nTook about 30 min to even figure out what went wrong. They credited my cousins account, not mine. Here’s how the convo went: \n\nMe: “okay, so, what do we do now? I still need my $70.\n\nThey shrug\n\nMe: “well I would feel bad asking my cousin for money from months ago that he didn’t even account for, it just magically came off his bill. He shouldn’t be punished for this mistake, and neither should I, right?”\n\nMore mumbles and shrugs, I’m getting nowhere. \n\nMe: “you made a mistake, and I expect it to be fixed without punishing my family”\n\nThem: “well it must have been a miscommunication somehow”\n\nI’m sorry, in WHAT world would I want to give the credit for MY phone that I was paying for to my cousin who’s account I was actively leaving? Like the guy was helping me LEAVE this plan onto my own. Nobody is that stupid right?\n\nThem: “normally we would make it right but the manager has to approve it and she isn’t here”\n\nCue silence. I do not reply thinking they’ll go on, they do not\n\n\nMe: “soooo what are you going to do? I still want it handled”\n\nDid you think I would just leave??? No reply\n\n\nMe: “can you write a note and have her call me when she’s in?”\n\nThem: “sure”\n\nI watch them write a sticky note and peek to make sure the note says something that sums it up. \n\nMe: “okay, have her call me, if I don’t hear anything soon I’m going to call myself in a few days”\n\nSo two days go by and no call. So yesterday, I call them. Guess who answers? The manager. \n\nManager: “Hello, what can I help you with?”\n\nMe: “well, a few months ago I traded in my phone and never got the credit so a few days ago I stopped by your store and they figured out they put the credit on an account that isn’t mine. (Name) said he left you a note to call me, but I guess not”\n\nManager: “(Name) you say? Can you hold for a minute?”\n\nMe: “Absolutely”\n\nSo I hold, presumably while she finds (Name)\n\nManager: “Okay, so can I get your phone number? And do you have the number for the account it went on?”\n\nMe: “Yes! Here’s mine, and the account is my cousins and here’s his number, the credit was for around $70 but I don’t know the exact number”\n\nManager: “Okay, so what I’m going to do is look on his account and find the exact amount and then credit you that amount, it should go through within a day or two and I’ll call you when it does”\n\nMe: “Wait really? That’s it? I assumed this would be more involved.”\n\nManager: “It’s a quick fix, and I’m so sorry this happened, and I would have called you if I had been told about it, I will make sure this is 100% made right.”\n\nMe: “Well thank you! I’m glad to have this solved”\n\nBut seriously the dude did NOT leave that note because he didn’t want to get in trouble. I’ve worked retail, I get what he did. It’s one thing to make a mistake, it’s another to not admit when you have.",

I needed some bread, and I go to the bread section and as I come round the corner one of the shop assistants is towering over me. I'm 6'5 so this is really rare, but I quickly noticed that she was on a stool restocking the top shelf and my mind was having a rest day. She asks me if I need anything (likely because of my confused expression) and I respond that I want some pancakes, near to where she is. I grab it, the final packet, and thank the assistant for her help. Another costumer then comes up to me, an elderly woman, and asks if I can grab something from the highest shelf. I get it for her and she thanks me.\n\nThis is where blind woman (BW) comes in. She's not literally blind, but she clearly believed that I worked at the store. The store uniform is dark green and I am wearing white jeans and a pink shirt, likely one of the best outfits to show people that you are not a member of staff.\n\nBW, to me, rudely: Where is the bakery?\n\nMe, not hearing her: I'm sorry, what?\n\nBW: I need bread. Where is it?\n\nMe: The bread is here\n\nBW, still rude: I need the bakery. You should know where it is!\n\nMe: Why should I know?\n\nBW: It's your job!, then she rants about speaking to a manager or something before I interput\n\nMe: I don't work here. I'm not in uniform.\n\nBW, angry: Don't lie to me! You helped that woman. I know you work here!\n\nMe: I was being polite, she couldn't reach the shelf.\n\nBW now descends into a some incomprehensible rant about how I do work here I am just lying, but now the store assistant from earlier comes up and asks if there is a problem. BW claims that I work at the store and refuse to help her, and I actually lied to her! She demands to see a manager, of course. The employee tries to tell her that I don't work there but BW doesn't listen. The employee gives me a look that says \"she is crazy, just go\", so I do. I later see BW at the front of the store arguing with several other shop assistants and what looked to be a manager. Hopefully she just got kicked out.\n\nIt's crazy  to think some people are so selfish that they cannot comprehend that someone could help another person without it literally being their job.",

Over the span of a year the long term staff started giving me discounted meal deals, coupons, start prepping my sandwich early as they see me in the queue. \n\nBut then I got pregnant, and morning sickness really killed my appetite. I couldn’t eat anything that I liked prior to being pregnant and basically survived on ginger biscuits and water for 2-3 months. Even just saying the name of the sandwich shop in my head would make me dry wretch.\n\nAround the 20 week mark I started feeling better, and gradually introduced old food favourites back into my diet. So one day during my lunch break I managed to drive to the shop, park up, step inside and place my order. Some new staff had started in the few months since I’d last been, but then I got to the cashier. \n\nIt was a regular and he smiled when he saw me, and said, “you’re back!”\nI chuckled a little and explained I had morning sickness (I also had a pretty noticeable bump but from the counter height they may not have seen it). \n\nHe ran my order through my usual discount and gave me some coupons along with my receipt. \n\nIt was really nice they remembered! Before I go on maternity leave I’m going to drop off some thank you gifts!",

        "text": "To whom it may concern,\n\nI am going to be explaining unprofessionalism and confusion I experienced recently through \"Rqinforest\"...com(A)\n\nThis all started about a week ago when I ordered 2 copies of the new black ops. These video games were supposed to come with beta codes to be able to play the private beta on August 10th-13th 2018. Rainforest is apparently a \"participating retailer\" for the beta codes when pre ordered through the Rainforest store. I don't know if you will still have our past conversations on file, but I tried to resolve this issue on more than one occasion. You see, the beta codes I tried to redeem on the games website were \"already used\". Both of the codes sent to me were redeemed is what the site told me. So I politely emailed you guys at Rainforest inquiring about this problem, and whilst you did get back to me, unfortunately, they just sent me the same codes that were already sent to me earlier. (No wonder these codes have been redeemed before, you send the same ones multiple times to different people) I again email you guys explaining that I have received the same codes as the ones you have emailed me a second time. All of the codes have already been used and redeemed that I have received from rainforest. Keep in mind this is way before the beta actually went live, before August 10th. The last email I had received from rainforest said \"rest assured, the beta hasn't started yet. Once it does, we will be sending you an email with the working code this time because the other ones were not intended or double checked for you to use.\" Now, before I continue, I hold nothing personal against the people that emailed me. The people that emailed me were friendly and trying their best, at least I hope so. I did however send another email to rain customer support, to which I didn't receive a reply for at all. That is when I started to get upset.\n\nI am baffled that I tried to redeem a beta code and went through this much hassle; to the point where the beta ends tomorrow, and I still have yet to play any of it. That to me is unacceptable. I might've expected this stuff if I had pre ordered in some wanna-be store and they just didn't care enough to double check the codes they were sending. But Ama-noz? Really? Not replying to my email when I was specifically told that it would be resolved, and to be \"rest assured\" that I would receive my beta code once the beta started; to which I received nothing, was beyond ridiculous. I mean, the lack of coordination between retailers and within the company is crazy. That is not what I would have expected in a million years from a billion dollar, United states driven corporation. I purchased 2 copies for a value of 130$ from you, expecting to receive a beta code which was included with pre ordering the games through the Rainforest store. I believe it to be highly unprofessional to be sent beta codes, on more than one occasion; that not only don't work, but likely have been sent to someone else for them to enjoy. It is not what I would have expected from Rainforest. ..comm, one of the biggest corporations out there. I have since given up on playing the beta, receiving my codes, or getting a reply to my other email. With everything that I have stated, I have decided to unfortunately cancel my pre-orders of Codbo4. No kind of treatment in that regard is accepted by me on behalf of my respect and dignity. I am sorry to say that I am very disappointed with this whole situation as I was looking forward to participating in the private beta to enjoy this limited time event before the game released. I hope this email does get a reply, and I hope a lot of people see it and realize; that Rainforest needs to get a grip on its coordination, accuracy, communication, and customer satisfaction.\n\nSincerely,\n\nA wronged customer\n\n\nThat is more or less what I sent to them in an email, they were so lost it was baffling on why I was even spending any money through them.

        "text": "This is something that happened to me a few months ago. An important thing to know is that I am a vegetarian. I don't consume any meat, including fish. My sister decided to have her birthday dinner at a popular seafood chain restaurant. I still came along because it was my sister's big day. I ordered some mozzarella sticks and thought I would enjoy just being with my family. I told the waitress before hand that I was veg and did not eat meat or fish. She assured me that my food would be made separate. When our food came out my order was correct but my mozzarella cheese sticks tasted HEAVILY of fish. I even had my sister try them to be sure it wasn't just in my head. I sent them back, asking the waitress to please make sure the new batch was made in a SEPARATE fryer. She came back several minutes later and told me 'Sorry we only have one fryer.' Confused by this, I asked if she was saying that EVERYTHING goes into the same fryer? She told me yes, everything goes in the same. Now I don't know how legal it is to only have one fryer for a whole resturant. But if I had any kind of allergy I would have been screwed. Do restaurants not realize that these kind of practices can hurt, seriously hospitalize, or even kill people?\n\n\nEDIT: Because people keep insisting that this is an act of entitlement,  I feel the need to say that I don't expect everywhere to be friendly to those with food restrictions. I usually avoid going out to eat all together for this very reason. The issue here is that the server told me my food would be made in a SEPARATE fryer while taking my order. It wasn't until after I got my food that the server looked into it and told me it was never made separate. This is a dangerous practice . If a resturant won't accomedate food requests that's okay. It's not okay when a resturant says they will and acts carelessly.",

Well, at the this particular Wally World, the rule is if you have an unbagged item, your receipt needs to be checked before you can exit the store.\n\nFor some reason, this rule used to irritate me a little bit- especially for items like cases of water. I guess I found it a bit accusatory or something since this doesn't occur in ALL Wally Worlds- just a select amount. But it hasn't been a huge deal. I'd always just keep my receipt out and hand it to the person checking receipts at the door, avoiding eye contact in my internal irritation. \n\nBut today the lady checking receipts made me think a bit differently. I hand her the receipt as normal, she checks it and I start to walk away. Then she catches me right before I leave and says, sounding a bit mentally drained, \"Thank you so much for being kind about this. Usually people aren't nice to me when I ask for their receipts and I really appreciate that you are.\"\n\nIt made me realize that I shouldn't be even *mildly* annoyed at the process; they're just doing what they get paid to do. Wally World also needs to crack down on theft which is understandable in any business.\n\nYeah, just be kind to the greeters/receipt checkers. They'll probably appreciate it a lot since they deal with assholes the majority of the day. Be nice to everyone for that matter. 😊",

I knew what I needed and happily looked around after that, since it's one of my favorite stores.  \n\nIt was somewhat busy since its saturday, so when I got to the checkouts, there were about 6 people waiting at the only checkout that was running. About 6 people got in line behind me. I the checkouts are arranged somewhat strangely. Two checkouts side by side, with one across from them, facing the first two.\n\nA half minute after I joined the line a cashier went to the free checkout across the other two, and called out next one please. Nobody moved for a few seconds, so when she called out again, I decided to move in. At that point a few people got mad at me, and said so loudly, telling me there were others ahead of me.\n\nI, startled, moved back a bit, and at that moment everybody behind me seemed to surge forward, getting in Line before me.\n\nI grumbled \"mother fucking... \"  under my breath. Note that I spoke English, while the native language is Dutch. \n\nIt didn't go over well. The person who had told me others were ahead had understood me, and thought I had cursed at him. He was a good head or two taller then me, an average sized woman. He whipped around and started yelling at me in English, daring me to call him a mother fucker again.\n\nI was angry at first. I tried to defend myself, saying I was cursing at life in general. He didn't stop yelling until the cashier took his attention by asking how he wanted to pay. \n\nHe walked off, and I started getting upset, shaking and trying to hold my tears back, since I get emotional easily. The cashier didn't comment at all. Afterward I went to find a quiet spot on the market to cry it out and compose myself.\n\nI don't really know what to think of it all. I know I was a bit clumsy, and should have kept my mouth shut, but I don't think I was really at fault. ",

Also, usage of a swear or so later on, relevant to the story. \n\nI arrive at the Meats Place to get my guilty pleasure (buffalo chicken sandwich, with that amazing ranch peppercorn sauce... yummm) and I'm two cars behind in the drive-thru. We will call the first car in line PIA because it rhymes with their car model... and second car will be Green, because their car was green and I didn't recognize the model logo.\n\nPIA is at the window, waiting for their food and stuff. And waiting... and waiting. It's 2:30 in the afternoon and the Meats Place is unusually busy for this time of day, which likely means they're not staffed enough for the unusual traffic load.\n\nEmployee leans out the window and talks to PIA guy who starts to pull forward. I guess they ordered something that is taking time to make or maybe there was some issue and it had to be remade or what not. There is a place off to the side after the drive thru in this location for a person to pull over and not be in the way.\n\nPIA decides to stop inside the drive-thru, a car-length ahead of Green, who has pulled forward.\n\nI'm watching this nervously, because I've got cars behind me and nowhere to go if PIA decides to be a butt and not move. \n\nPIA then suddenly began to back up, nearly hitting Green, who yells something out the window. An employee goes out and tells PIA to pull off to the side and their food will be out soon. \n\nPIA blows a cloud of cigarette smoke directly into employee's face but pulls up. Green has their food and employee moves so Green can leave. The woman in Green's car leans over and calls the employee a cunt. \n\nI'm watching this all happen in complete confusion. What the heck is Green's problem? They should be calling PIA a next Tuesday, not the employee. Additionally, what the heck is PIA's problem? \n\nWho the heck pulls that crap with people who are being nothing but polite and trying to get everyone moving along? The world doesn't revolve around us hungry drive-thru goers. The schedule is based on the previous schedule and how busy it's expected, and if it's busier than expected, there's not much they can do. They can't magically get someone to show up to work  on their day off, and they can only guess how much food to prepare in advance while trying to avoid making TOO much that it gets thrown out.\n\nI end up driving behind Green when I leave (they had to stop at a light). Turns out they drive like they act, because I watched them zoom through a long red light, causing the other lane to slam on their breaks to avoid an accident while Green slammed on the horn and, as I could see through their driver window because of the angle, give them the finger.\n\nI know this isn't a very eventful story but it kind of bugged me. People like Green and PIA treat others like garbage because they think they can get away with it, and they usually can. It's ridiculous what employees get blamed for when it's another customer causing the problems.",

I am also allergic to bananas, and will be vomiting for hours if I eat one. \n\nWe go in and look at the menu and I notice that some smoothies have almonds and bananas listed as ingredients. With both my allergies being serious, I asked the person working if they had a separate blender or something for people with nut allergies (I did specify that I was deathly allergic to almonds). He said that they had blender that had recently been cleaned and he would use that one for my order. Sweet. \n\nI order a mango smoothie without bananas. This smoothie had 5 ingredients listed on the menu board and none of them were almonds, but I still reiterated that I was deathly allergic to almonds when I ordered. \n\nWe get our smoothies and sit down. I take a few sips and my mouth/throat start to itch. This is a new allergy and I have had my epi-pen for 4 days. So I am panicking and choking and my friend is trying to get me to calm down so she can stab it into the right part of my thigh. She stabs me then drives me to the hospital. \n\nMy mom came down to take care of me. While I was in the hospital, my mom called the smoothie place and just let them have it. She didn't cuss until the end when she said, \"if my baby had died cause you guys are fucking morons then y'all would know hell.\" \n\nMy mom also called corporate and wrote both a yelp and google review warning people with food allergies to stay away. Corporate was nice enough to take care of my medical bills, pay for serveral epi-pens (which are ridiculously expensive), and gave me some pocket money. I've never gone back to that smoothie place so I don't know what happened to the employee. ",

I CAN'T BELIEVE -YOU PEOPLE-! ALL OF YOU HAVE BEEN LIKE THIS.  WHY CANT I JUST GET SOME FUCKING NOODLES! \n\nAt this point the cashier doesn't really know what to do, and me the homeless man and her all glance back and forth at each other like \"Did she really just say that?\" As the CNL stormed out the door in a huff. \n\nHoneslty I didnt say anything about the incident but I did hand her a nice tip when I took my food to-go.\n\nSome people are just so unbelievable.",

        "text": "Background: My brother is allergic to raw tomatoes. He can eat sauce and ketchup but he can't eat tomato slices. Once a month we go out to eat at this local restaurant to catch-up on life. Most of the staff knows us and knows about my brother's allergy.\n\nWe went into the restaurant like normal and got seated. Everything is fine and we order our food from the waitress. We order two burgers and my brother gets one without tomatoes (he made it very clear he was allergic) and I get one without onions (I can't stand onions, not allergic just don't like them.). We wait for our food, say hello to a couple of staff members we know, and talk about life. Waitress comes back with our burgers and neither of us get what we ordered. I can just scrape the onions off but my brother needs a whole new burger made because there is tomato juice all over it. This is how the conversation went. Me for me, W for waitress, and B for my brother.\n\nMe: I'm sorry but my brother asked for no tomatoes. He's allergic.\n\nB: I can't eat this I need another one.\n\nW: Can't you just scrape your tomatoes off like she's scraping of the onions?\n\nAt this point I noticed something. She had on a trainee badge. She was new. I would have normally raised hell at that point but I figured that I'd cut the new girl some slack.\n\nMe: \"He can't. The tomato juice is all over the burger now and it got absorbed into the bun.\" \n\nB: \"I could die if I eat this. She doesn't like onions. I physically can't have raw tomato.\"\n\nW: \"Okay I'll get them to remake your order\"\n\nShe takes my brother's burger and goes into the kitchen. Not a minute later she comes back with what is obviously the same burger but with the tomatoes scraped off.  She had this smug look on her face like she pulled something over on us. My brother being the trusting soul that he is said thank you and almost took a bite. I stopped him and told him to check the bun. Little bits of tomato were all over the inside of it. When confronted this is what she said\n\nW: \"He used ketchup on his fries!\"\n\nMy brother is allergic to a specific enzyme that denatures when the tomato is cooked. When my brother explained this she got all huffy and just mentioned the ketchup again. At this point I got up and got the manager. When I came back my brother (who never gets angry) was almost screaming at her. She had apparently shoved the burger an inch from his face and accused him of faking his allergy. Now the manager gets involved and tells her to back away. He apologized for her behavior and comped our meal. Later that week I found out that the waitress was fired over the incident.\n\nTl;dr: Waitress ignores my brother's allergy to tomatoes, tries to force him to eat a burger with them on it.",

There literally isn't a burger on the menu that doesn't have it. \n\nSo I order, I tell the bartender no bacon. And in an almost apologetic tone, I said, I don't want to sound like a pain, but I really don't eat pork at all. So if the kitchen does put bacon on there, we're not just scraping it off, you'll need to remake it. \n\nYou can guess the next part. \n\nI politely say, remember when I said no bacon? I can't eat that, you're going to need to remake it. Bartender says sure. \n\nWalks it to the kitchen, walks right back out with obviously the same burger with the bacon scraped off. \n\nReally? You thought, what, I'd not notice you were in there for less than a minute? I mean, c'mon. \n\nAt that point, I politely tell her I'm not eating anything coming out of that kitchen, and I'm not paying for it either. She's insisting I will have to pay for the food. \n\nManager is summoned, who also insists I have to pay for the food. I'd handed over a credit card when I ordered my first drink \n\nI told them I'd pay for the drinks. Or, they could charge my card, I'd dispute it with the card company, and they'd end up getting nothing. \n\nMuch back and forth. I tell them they better give me my credit card back, I'll pay cash for the drinks. If they don't give me my card, I'll have to call the police. \n\nGot my card, paid for the drinks (tipped 20% on those, kind of conflicted on that but I usually tip more like 30% so, whatever). \n\nThis was five or six months ago. Since then, the place has been shut down (briefly) by the health department for a roach infestation. So I guess I dodged a bullet. Or a bug, whatever. \n\nI've had this problem a few times, not often, where places think scraping off the bacon means its ok. Nope, there's pork grease on there and I'm not eating it. Am I being unreasonable? \n\nNote: it isn't a religious thing, or an allergy, I just think the smell and taste of anything pork is gross. \n",

Now as a 20 year old male this would be a great little nerd toy to have considering the whole Star Wars series is my favorite, Luke Skywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi, Han Solo and even Chewie. The whole shebang! \n\nThe light saber itself cost around $37.87 plus $7 for shipping and I was expecting a pretty decent and not over the top lightsaber and I was exstatic. The furst red flag that was thrown and I didn't notice was that it was comming from China. I thought that was no big deal so that (insert asshole company here) could cut down on shipping and manufacturing.\n\nAfter 11 days the package finally arrives and as I get off of work at 1:00 at night, I retrieve it from my mailbox. Immediately as I pick it up I notice its super light and read some of the writing on the package and it just reads plastic tube. I assumed it was the actual tube for the saber and the other part got kost or is delayed, nbd.\n\nWell I open it up and immediately regret even looking at their website. It's an all plastic pos toy that looks like a kid bought it with their allowance money and threw it in the box. I was furious, so furious I immediately crushed the toy with my hands and threw it in the garbage. \n\nI knew china did chinsy, but not a $37 plastic pos toy chinsy.

        "text": "I always enjoy reading about other’s experiences, hopefully this story, while long, will be entertaining.\n\nFirst some background. I’m not overly neat by any means, but I do like to be to have the house at least minimally put together before going to bed each night. So, one evening in particular, I am a little extra scrupulous roaming the house, retrieving dishes from living room and bedrooms (Ughhh, teenagers!!!) and I load the dishwasher and wipe the sink out. I like the sink wiped out. I just do. It’s worth noting that although it was late, it’s summer and I am the first to go to bed. I'm a teacher, and still have a few days before going back to work.  My 17 year old son had 2 friends over who were up, and my youngest son (14) and youngest daughter (21) were also still up. The next morning when I get up everyone is still asleep.  No problem, I have some errands to run, so I’ll just sneak out. As I enter the kitchen, I notice the sink not only full of dishes, but dishes that are absolutely disgusting with what looks to be chunks of cocoa powder, oatmeal and peanut butter cemented to them. I should have been glad they were in the sink, but no I was a little grouchy and people should be able to clean up after themselves, right? Then, I notice my favorite (and only) tweezer pouch that one of my children had borrowed on the floor under the kitchen table – MISSING my favorite pair of tweezers. Yes, I have a special pouch with a few pairs of tweezers - each with a different purpose.  Seriously, I don’t mind loaning things out, but please take care of things and put them back. I admit to being a little personal about my tweezers.  I shrug it off (not really), and as I get ready to pull out of the driveway, I notice two house chairs, one a kitchen chair, the other a computer chair, sitting just inside the outside chain link gate, totally visible from the street. I have no idea why our chairs are out there. \n\nWell, I proceed to go do my shopping – all the while feeling a little grouchy, and a little pushed out of shape. \n\nNow, when I shop by myself I tend to take my time, looking at things on this side of the store, then at that side, then oh wait, forgot that this is way over here… you get the idea. I do notice though, that occasionally, my toes are just a little gritty, like I’m walking through sand. I’m wearing scandals, so I think to myself that someone must have spilled something and go on my merry way. Finally, I get into line ready to put my items on the conveyor belt when the shopper behind me points out that my bag of sugar is leaking. I look down and it’s not just a leak it’s more of a stream, as at my feet is forming an actual pyramid of sugar. As I stare at the growing pyramid as if in shock, the woman behind me quickly picks up the bag, stopping the leak. I thank her profusely and at that very moment three employees appear, one with a giant broom. One of them of them loudly shouts out to the rest of the store “found her” and then describes the search and cleanup that has been going on as they tried to track down whoever was leaving a trail of sugar throughout the entire store. One employee compared the experience to looking for Hansel and Gretel. I am at this point utterly and thoroughly embarrassed at having caused such a mess and notice the crowd of customers watching and pointing out the trail, as they stood in their own lines. I apologized profusely, and although the cashier and other employees were very gracious, I’m sure they didn’t think it was as hilarious as my children did. An employee even went and got me another package of sugar (maybe they didn’t trust me to handle another one on my own).\n\nWhen I got home, my daughter who had borrowed the tweezers apologized about losing the tweezers (and then found them - in the couch?) My 17-year-old teenager and his friends admitted taking the chairs outside and forgetting to bringing them in; and then I found out that my 14 and 21 year old had on their own picked up dishes from all over the house that their sibling and friends had left out everywhere and put them in the sink to soak. \n\nAll of my kids' friends now know the story.

        "text": "So for about six or seven years, I used to get pneumonia, walking pneumonia, or double pneumonia about two to three times a year. I most commonly got pneumonia, with double pneumonia being the next most regular. Essentially, as I would later learn, my history and re-flaring of asthma constructed my bronchial tubes so much so that my lugs would become a paradise for pneumonia. \n\nWith that out of the way, I have a primary physician that I've been seeing since I was a kid. He's (generally) good at diagnosing me and prescribing the right medication. However, he just can't seem to figure out what pneumonia is like. \n\nI would get the telltale signs that always signified the oncoming of pneumonia: an odd smell in my nose, chills without a fever, pressure on my chest, wet coughing, difficulty breathing, etc. When two or three of these would present themselves early enough, I'd go to the primary physician and get him to check me out. The first time, I can understand. These aren't necessarily \"absolute pneumonia\" symptoms. However, after this continued happening, I got less and less enthused by his results. He would always just tell me that it was allergies. Then, I would end up having to go to an emergency care clinic that day or the following day. There, they would x-ray my lungs and find - you guessed it - pneumonia. \n\nIt's not that the doctor's office my primary physician is at doesn't have an x-ray machine, it's just that he's so quick to diagnose me with allergies and move on. As you can imagine, after several years of this, my lungs started to get worn down. I would get winded a lot faster because of a) the closed off tubes and b) constantly dealing with pneumonia. I finally decided to go see a pulmonologist who starts me on a breathing treatment regiment, upping my medical inhaler dosage, and giving me a regular pneumonia shot a few times a year. That was a bit ago and I'm happy to say that my lungs are healthier and I haven't gotten pneumonia in years (knock on wood). So I mean I guess my primary physician was kind of right; because of my allergies and asthma, I was getting pneumonia.\n\nIt wasn't funny to me each time I was dealing with pneumonia because it's not really as fun as it sounds. But my folks and I tend to joke about it whenever something is wrong with one of us now. Cancer, you say? Probably just allergies. You got Parkinson's? Nah, just allergies.\n\nTl;Dr - struggled with constant pneumonia for six years because my primary care physician would never diagnose it, instead just saying I had \"allergies.\"",

        "text": "First time poster in this subreddit!\n\n\nI just thought back to the story I'll now tell. Happened at the beginning of this week.\n\n\nI live in the countryside and we don't have a good public transportation system. Important for the story: We don't even have ticket dispensers for the train here, we have to get our tickets by the  inspector. \n\n\nMy best friend and me wanted to drive to the next city to go shopping. We hop in the train and get a seat, what a normal person would do. We then wait for the inspector. They're ALWAYS on this train we were in, without exception. Since many people need to get their tickets by the inspector in that train.\n\n\nAnd there was an inspector. In full gear, with that small ticket printer at the waist. A young female one. She walked across the train a few times, without noticing us or anyone else. In fact, she didn't check on anyones tickets or talked to anyone.\n\n\nMy friend and me sure found that strange so I decide to talk to her the next time she comes over. I say a polite \"Excuse me\" and guess what, she ignores me! She doesn't even look at me and just walks past me. At this point we were convinced that that woman was a robot. \n\n\nSo yeah, we got to a two hour ride in the train for free because of an ignorant inspector. We still had to get a ticket to get back, tho.",

        "text": "So a few years ago I was buying last minute Christmas gifts for some people (how last minute? Xmas eve. Yup, I know. Anyway) at my local mall. Things were going smoothly, it was early so not crazy busy. I passed by a kiosk selling board games and saw a few I thought my friends would like.\n\nThe cashier was this bored, sullen looking man about a decade older than me. I took my items over to him and he rings them up. The price was something like 92 dollars. I took out my wallet and was kinda fumbling with my money but I was sure I counted out 95 altogether. Handed him the money. He counts it and tells me I’m short, only gave him 90 and to give him another five (yeah he literally said I should give another 5 dollar bill instead of just two one dollar bills I may possibly have.)\n\nI was about to pull out more money but i totally thought I gave him 95 so I said politely ‘oh I’m sorry I thought I gave you 95.’ He flatly says, ‘No you didn’t.’ And his attitude about it is starting to show. So I ask (again, still nice) if he wouldn’t mind counting out the money in his hand. He raises his voice and says ‘Give me more money!’\n\nWhat. The. Fuck???\n\nNow I’m pissed. I tell him to count it out again. He begrudging starts counting it quietly and I can count along the bills he’s shuffling. 20. 40. 60. 80. 85. There are two more bills left and I can see that but he does a REALLY poor fake shuffle of it and acts like he’s counting the last 5 dollar at only 90. He Gives me a look like ‘there, see?’\n\nYeah, I do see asshole.\n\nI reach into the pile he’s holding and pull out the extra five he tried to hide and give him a glare. He wordlessly puts all the money into the register and gives me back my 3 dollar change. He tries to act friendly after and says thank you happy holidays or something. I was so mad I just grabbed my stuff and walked off.\n\nGuessing he did that crappy scam to everyone who paid cash there that day. Trying to earn a little extra cash out of desperate and frazzled holiday shoppers. Made me sick.",

        "text": "I bike to work and without a bicycle, it's a 3 mile walk to work for me.\n\nSo my bike needed a new chain. It's an 80s beach cruiser. Pretty much worthless but it was mine. Instead of going to the bike shop I'd always been to before, I opted to go to the one that was closer to my house (so that I didn't have to walk my bike too far). Drop off the bike. A few days later they call to tell me the whole drivetrain needs to be replaced and it'll cost more than what the bike is worth. I said I don't care, I'll pay whatever, I just need my bike. (I live in a small-ish town and don't have a car, so for me to get a new bike would really be a pain in the butt of scouring the internet and traveling by bus to another city to pick up a bike. The shop told me they don't sell bikes, so it was either a big-box-store bike or the internet. I'd rather just pay for the convenience of having my bike fixed within walking distance of my house.)\n\nAbout a week later that they were still looking for the part and I reaffirmed that I just wanted the bike fixed and didn't care if it cost more than it was worth, I would pay.\n\nThen I left the country for a month (I'm a teacher on summer vacation). Looked forward to picking up my fixed bike when I got home. Lo and behold the bike is not fixed. Again they repeated that the repair would be more than the bike's worth -- um, yeah, but I said I'd pay??? Finally they said they didn't think the bike would ever be safe to ride again. Well, I can't argue with that.\n\nLuckily they happened to have another bike that day that they offered to sell me, admittedly for a good deal. I accepted and paid on the spot. Then they said this bike just has a flat tire and they'll fix it for me if I can come back in a couple hours. Ok, no problem.\n\nI come back in a few hours. It's not ready, can I come back tomorrow (Saturday) morning? Fine. Come back Saturday morning. No, come back in the afternoon. Um, ok... I call them in the afternoon and they say it's still not ready and they're usually closed on Sundays but this Sunday they'll be open 11 to 3, come by then. Ugh, fine. Around noon on Sunday I walk over there. It's closed and my original bike is sitting out in the parking lot, I guess next to the scrap pile, taunting me.\n\nFinally the mechanic calls and says come by about 8pm.\n\nThen I get a text saying he's worn out from working 12-hour days and won't be able to make it tonight.\n\nUm, what??? Supposedly this was just to fix a flat! Also, if he's overworked, that's not my problem!\n\nI go back to work on Monday (today) and have no way to get there except a 3 mile walk in August heat.\n\nSo this morning I call the main location and ask to speak to a manager. I explain that bicycle is my only mode of transportation and I don't mind if they need a few extra days, just please tell me when it'll be ready and stick to it. Keep in mind I've already paid for the bike! The manager realizes I'm the person who left her original bike there for a month and gets very snippy with me. It was like he was annoyed I'd left my bike there for so long -- well, they were supposed to be fixing it during that time! He tells me he's got a ton of bikes to work on and he doesn't understand why people complain so much without moving on, and what do I want him to do. I was pretty stung by this and I said I just want to know when my bike will be ready. He goes, \"About a week,\" and hangs up.\n\nWhy is it going to take another week to fix a flat tire? Why are they being so rude to me? They clearly don't want my business. I felt like they were holding my first bike hostage and now they're holding my second bike hostage too. I don't care about how much it costs, I just need a way to get to work! The thing is that online this shop has great reviews, so it's like for some reason they just hate me.\n\nJust needed to rant. Thanks.",

She stood up straight, glared at me and almost spewed an angry: \"I dont work her you stupid cunt!\" at me before stomping off.\n\nI was taken off guard and just stood there before turning around and sighing in relieve because nobody saw that.

        "text": "   My family and I  in Europe and didn't know the local language, but most people knew English si it wasn't too hard in the end. \n    \n\n  We went to dinner at a local restaurant in a small non tourist town. They didn't have English menus but that was expected. So we get our menus and sit down.\n\n\n  And wait.\n\n\n  And wait.\n\n\n We see the server going to tables right next to us. We try to get her attention to no avail. She's purposefully ignoring us. \n\nI could understand this going on for maybe 5 minutes. \n\n\n But then its hit the 50 minute mark. No service at all for almost an hour. At this point it's not worth it and we haven't even had ANYTHING at all so we just start walking out. Of course NOW the waitress acknowledges the fact that we exist and says \"where are you going? Excuse me?\". We just took a page from her book and ignored her and got out. \n\n I still think about it. Was there something else we didn't notice? And then I realize that there was nothing preventing her from even looking at us. That was one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had. I don't even know why she acted like that. We went obviously Americans so maybe there's some racism or something there? I'll probably never know but our hotel there was one if the best experiences I've had staying at one. All the rest of my experiences there were great. Any theories?",
