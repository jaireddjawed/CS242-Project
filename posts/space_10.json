So basically Star Wars is real, Avatar is real, even the Marvel heroes exist, just in other universes, right?\nIf that's the case, wouldn't a being powerful enough and with the will to destroy all the universes exist? If so, how are we still alive? If such a being truly did exist, we would be long gone. And since us still being alive disproves the existence of such a creature, doesn't it also disprove this theory?",

        "text": "I love science. I trust science. But the nature of science is that it constantly disproves itself. Science is basically just the study of wtf is going on. If you didn‚Äôt hear, NASA has made a discovery that defies what we thought we knew about the birth of our universe. and this is not scary or disappointing, this is exciting. But- I don‚Äôt wanna talk about that. I want to talk about how us humans, on one of the smallest planets in the solar system, think we‚Äôve got it figured out. \n\n\nMath is just a formulaic way to describe science. Science tells you what happens. Math proves that it happens every time. We have managed to advance our understanding of the universe through math and science, and it‚Äôs unfathomably impressive what we‚Äôve done from our little planet. But what can actually figure out from our point of view? I‚Äôd argue not much past our cluster of galaxies. Everything beyond must be speculation. Intricately constructed, highly educated speculation, but speculation nonetheless. I have no doubt that scientists know what they‚Äôre looking at, and how to accurately observe it. But I think it‚Äôs possible they‚Äôre observing something totally irrelevant.\n\n\nImagine this-you have can of tiny organisms that you toss into a field. They don‚Äôt know where they are, they spend years figuring out how escape the can. They eventually do, and they see the grass, they feel the wind. They work together, spending years learning about wind patterns, weather, seasons, studying the soil. The only conclusion that makes sense is that a strong gust of wind blew them into this field. Everything they know about their environment points to one conclusion, and they DO have an amazing understanding of their environment. But they‚Äôre wrong, you threw them into the field.  \n\n\nIt‚Äôs just fascinating. I never know if we are at the height of our scientific understanding as a species , or witnessing the very start of it.",

        "text": "Thin wafer of ice under polarized light. For one weekend, I had access to a -90 degree centigrade freezer. So what would *you* do in space with a weekend and a freezer?¬† I made ice; ice in special thin wafers by freezing thin sheets of water (1mm thick and 50mm in diameter held in a wire frame)¬† and looking at the distribution of interlocking crystals made visible by placing between crossed polarizing filters. What I found surprising was the bubbles, formed by freezing out dissolved air, were uniformly distributed throughout the wafer. On Earth, air bubbles are likewise frozen out but are pushed by the freezing front into the center of the ice cube.¬† Why in weightlessness the bubbles were not pushed around I do not know.¬†  Nikon D3s, photo 1 shows ice under polarized light, photo 2 shows same ice under normal light, photo 3 shows the crossed polarizer setup using a laptop display for polarized illumination with a single polarizing filter.
