Taking an algorithms course although I haven't derived a function in 7 years. \n\nOne of my weakest development skills is visualizing and implementing algorithms. For example I can handle something simple like a checkers board fairly easily. But creating my own implementation of edge detection is extremely difficult. I love patterns but trying to visualize the patterns and then develop code to run through and find those patterns is hard for me. And this doesn't even consider trying to minimize resource usage/time big O notation stuff.\n\nAre there any good resources out there for improving this skill? Maybe some tips on how to approach these problems and break them down quickly? I'll even jump at some sort of code a problem answer a day exercise to practice. \n\nI can figure out these kinds of algorithms  on my own. But it takes too long. I was hoping to find techniques and common patterns or something to help me speed up my implementations.\n\nThanks for all your help!",

I might deliver a higher quality product, but I think most people would rather fuck off and get the work done with minimal hassle.  I'm a whole fuck-bucket of hassle.\n\nMy speed sucks.  I'm so fucking guilty of vaporware in my own startup endeavors.  I haven't once scaled a successful GitHub repo.  I second-guess all my shit so that even when the community loved the shit I did years ago, I told everybody the software wasn't ready.\n\nI just don't feel like I have the con-artist skills required to succeed as a, \"self-starter\" and I don't have the lemming skills needed to succeed as an, \"employee\".  I hate fucking adapting to all the bullshit software that keeps coming out.\n\nLike, running Docker on a desktop when the majority of computers are running Ubuntu/MacOSX because people think it's easier to configure a VM over simply writing branching code to run on two operating systems?  C'mon.\n\nMy saltiness is real.\n\nHowever, earnestly, I know being \"senior\" means that I stop improving myself if I stop looking for ways to do that.  I'm glad to be back part of an organization to see how effective others are.\n\nI hate operating with stress as well.  I like taking my sweet time to think through problems but maybe I shouldn't be avoiding the stress so much?  I have this fear that this stuff all transcends into my personal life, and many of my relationships make the comment that I'm so fucking in my head that I forget to act.  Like how the fuck do I overcome THAT in my software practice and just accept fucked and buggy software that ships continuously and early before anything is built like every other fucking software person on the planet?\n\nPlease help me to transcend the flowery fields of neckbeards / IPA's / zen meditation / constant backlogs and missed quarterly targets / perpetually early software releases that break backwards compatability / managing to max out a CPU for simple software in 2018 / thinking I'm a fucking genius while doing all of the above / thinking I'm hot shit when I'm an overweight pre-diabetic or a scrawny ass dude obsessed with pickup artist subreddits.\n\nBonus points if you can help me transcend the art of owning a $8,000 road bike and pretending I'm not a new age jackass exchanging a golf green for asphalt while still believing myself to be a sensible progressive and a believer in, \"the environment\".\n\nAlso, the people in IT who think they are the brainchildren of value by riding the DevOps wave because filling up your balance sheet with cloud expenses makes you look important.  The more SLA's, the better.  Accountability (always someone else's fault) and money!",

I'm carrying out research on code understandability.\n\nThe aim of my work is to check if it is possible to measure code understandability, in order to help developers improving their code quality.\n\nTo do that, we are gathering data about the understandability of some code snippets. At the moment, we have a negative result: it seems that none of the metrics currently defined are able to capture understandability.\n\nSo, I would need the help of as many (possibly experienced) Java developers as possible to gather more data. Can you please help me with that? \n\nThis is the link to the web app: https://intersimone999.github.io/understandability . It will let you evaluate 8 random Java snippets. The system lets you navigate through the classes referred by the snippet (more or less like an IDE). You should just carefully read and understand the snippets. For each snippet, you can say if you understood it or not. If you say you understood the snippet, you get three questions about it. \n\nThe survey takes less than 20 minutes. You can also complete part of the survey and continue it after some time (it will memorize the number of snippets you already evaluated).\n\nI will keep confidential your personal data (names and email addresses), I will not share them with anyone else. \n\nAlso, I will share with you the results of my work as soon as they are ready.\n\nThanks a lot for the help!",

        "text": "I was lucky enough to score a sweet job as a reliability engineer in a global company’s blockchain division where the primary languages are JavaScript and Node.js (as well as something called docker?). I am a mechatronics engineering graduate with most of my experience in stuff with low levels of abstraction. I learned how bits and gates translated to assembly and how assembly translated to c. I did a lot of robotics as well as some low level computer systems stuff so I have a great understanding of how underlying software translates to hardware. How can I best learn the information necessary to step up to the next layer of abstraction needed to fully understand the three topics I mentioned earlier? I started using code academy to learn the basics of JavaScript already but I really want to dig into some example projects so I can get some real experience putting all the pieces of the puzzle together. Also if anyone knows of any good methods to learn github I need to get familiar with that as well. I know I can’t miraculously learn this stuff in a week but I just need to get started. Any suggestions are appreciated!\n\n(P.S. they know that I don’t know these languages I told them that in each interview I just think they mostly expect me to be able to figure it out.) ",

I have multiple personal projects and I had an internship over the summer (2017) as a full-stack developer.   \n\n1 . If I spend so much time practicing and I do get the get job because I passed the technical interview but I'm weak when it comes to the \"real stuff\", then will I get fired?  \n\n2 . When applying to software engineering positions, does every company hold technical interviews regardless of the years of experience they have?\n\nI know these questions might seem obvious and outlandish, but I just want to get a clear sense of some possible scenarios as graduation looms on the horizon.  Just feeling very confused about this and life, in general.           \n\n",
