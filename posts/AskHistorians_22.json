        "text": "Hey Ya'll\n\nI'm looking for cases in the past that are in some way resemble the judicial reform that is currently being past in Israel.\n\n[To sum this case I'll use the the first paragraph from the wiki article about that subject.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Israeli_judicial_reform)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The **2023 Israeli judicial reform** is a proposed series of changes to the [judicial system and the balance of powers in Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary_of_Israel) put forward by the current Israeli government, and spearheaded by [Deputy Prime Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_of_the_Prime_Minister_of_Israel) and [Minister of Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Justice_(Israel)) [Yariv Levin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yariv_Levin) and the Chair of the [Knesset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knesset)'s Constitution, Law and Justice Committee, [Simcha Rothman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simcha_Rothman). It seeks to curb the judiciary's influence over lawmaking and public policy by limiting the [Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court)'s power to exercise [judicial review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_review), granting the government control over judicial appointments and limiting the authority of government legal advisors.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Israeli_judicial_reform#cite_note-:10-1) If adopted, the reform would grant the [Knesset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knesset) the power to override Supreme Court rulings by a [simple majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_majority_vote), diminish the ability of the court to conduct judicial review of legislation and of administrative action, prohibit the court from ruling on the constitutionality of basic laws, and change the makeup of the [Judicial Selection Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_Selection_Committee_(Israel)) so that a majority of its members are appointed by the government.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Israeli_judicial_reform#cite_note-:04nytimes-2)[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Israeli_judicial_reform#cite_note-:3-3)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOr in my own words and my view of the situation - \n\nThe current case is a prime minister (Highest authority in Israel's case) is accused of criminal misconduct and therefore he accuses the judicial system of trying to overthrow the elections results by charging him with false accusations. You can't be prime minister if you're in jail. So there's a reform currently being passed by him that tries to amputate and remove the supreme court's independence and power to cancel laws that are what's known as the [\"basic Laws\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Laws_of_Israel) . A set of quasy constitution laws that form the set of values of the state of Israel. So the eventually the supreme couldn't cancel Netanyahu's position as PM. To make it clear. It's relatively easy to pass a basic law as shown by 2018 controversial [\"Nation State Law\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law:_Israel_as_the_Nation-State_of_the_Jewish_People) passed also under Netanyahu's regime.\n\nAlthough  populist Netanyahu is elected by majority, currently Israel is in a turmoil as polls show  that the majority of Israelis are against the reform, and the fragility of what's left of the democracy in that state looks like is about to crack and enter into a Polish / Hungarian spin. And in my subjective view, we're in a state of [Tyranny of the Majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority)\n\nI was wondering if perhaps some of you could share some cases that happened in the passed that resemble the current case in Israel. Hopefully also cases that turned out eventually for the better (I guess like current case of Brazil perhaps? note sure)\n\nBy the way, the way that the reform presented by Netanyahu and why it's a good thing for democracy is the following:\n\nThe supreme court judges are [selected by a council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_Selection_Committee_(Israel)) with the majority of the council is from the judicial system. The idea is to change the balance so the **politicians** would be the ones who would have the majority and therefore would better represent the \"peoples \" voice. As it is the case in places like the USA and UK etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you",

        "text": "Simple question, however, reasoning will be provided. I don't think much can be known about these peripheral Bronze Age kingdoms, but there might be something I'm missing. As far as I know, Edomite/Mt Seir peoples didn't have a naval culture, but I wonder if there's evidence of a coastal presence in the period before the arrival of the Philistines.\n\nThe reasoning is speculative, but multiple clues lined up to at least be interesting.\n\nFirst, I am interested in the Siphium trade network of Roman Era diaspora Jews. I have long suspected their patronage of the Asclepius cult near Cyrene. Obviously, sponsor the people who market your product. There are other small links like the Pool of Bethesda. The Cyrenian Jews seem to have been heavily involved in Jerusalem even as other diaspora groups distanced from Jerusalem and even Judaism. I have wondered if the Menorah was not the original Levite icon, and the reason why the Nehushtan arrives in the Exodus tale is because of a form of sincere product placement (we can imagine silphium money helping to fund the Septuagint). Even with early concepts of the Jewish Jesus, and Pauline Jesus, you can derive links to Asclepian motifs.\n\nIn this vein, I was interested in Glaucus of the Greek tradition, and his link to Andreas and Lukuas associated with the Basilidean Gnostic school and the Lukan gospel.\n\nGlaucus is associated with a magic herb.\n\nLooking at Asclepian cult centers, both are in Carian territory, even the Peloponnesian center (a trade outpost of Caria). The main center was at Cos. Cos has a very curious Meropian tradition, of people who refuse to worship the gods and are turned into birds. Merops is notably turned into the constellation Aquila. Naturally, the refusal to worship foreign gods is uniquely Hebrew.\n\nYes, it's superficial, but Kos reminded me of Koze, whose symbol was the Eagle. There is a line of thought which supposes that the ancients didn't much bother to distinguish between Yahweh and Koze, assuming one was merely a name for the other.\n\nSo, to complete the hypothesis, you have the civilization of the Middle East Steppe. The northern peoples are known as Israelites, even into pre-Islamic times. The southern peoples are Edomites.\n\nAfter the return from the Babylonian captivity, the precise delineation between these two \"Hebrew\" groups becomes unclear. The Sadducee faction could as much include one or the other, possibly a mix, while something like the later Ebionite faction is likely Israelite and orients East and toward Joseph.\n\nThus, the Cyrenian Jews are essentially Sadducee. To this group, the temple and its priesthood are more of a national estate than a precise religious cult. Their interest would be more in the national health, rather than completely accurate religious canon. While explicitly Idumean, the Costobaran Herods demonstrate a very late expression of the Koze cult.\n\nWith this cultural structure in mind, reversing to the Early Bronze Age, you have southern Hebrews in the area between Mt. Seir and the coast inclusive, before the arrival of Philistines. These \"Edomites\" enter into the broader Minoan/Egyptian thalassocracy, founding colonies in Caria. The Carians support the Egyptians against the Hittites. The Carian and Edomite cultures are sundered by the Bronze Age Collapse.\n\nThat is the structure of the hypothesis, and evidence for it would be found in the constitution of coastal South Canaanites prior to the collapse.",

According to the *Little Illiad*, Neoptolemos, the son of Achilleus, called to Troy to help the Achaians, fought Eurypylos, the son of Telephos, who had come to help the Trojans. Eurypylos was killed; but he killed Machaon first. When the Asian hero claimed his victim before going down, was that victim *helping* the Achaian hero, and so enabling him to win? In Pindar's story, Patroklos and Achilleus fought Telephos together. In a pre-Homeric version, was Patroklos *helping* Achilleus when Hektor killed him, and Achilleus killed Hektor ? And did Homer alter it, for the greater glory of Achilleus, and consequent dimunition of Hektor, and in order to motivate the return of Achilleus through desire for honourable revenge?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI thought this was indeed an interesting and brilliantly revisionist idea. I assume it's Lattimore's own and haven't been able to find anything related to this on Google after a bit of searching. Given that his work is over 70 years old, has there been any further scholarship about this idea?",

Was there any specific show, marketing campaign, whatever that put him and his ears on the track for icon status? Was it a combination of things?

        "text": "As far as I understand from my dabbling in Roman history, the practice of deifying the emperor started with Augustus' deification of Caesar, and gradually became part of the standard toolkit of imperial pomp and circumstance. It was a sort of baseline expectation that an emperor would be deified upon death; if you didn't get it, it meant that the Senate, at least, hated your guts and/or you got deposed by someone who hated your guts. However, it also seems to have been the case that some pretty dodgy and unpopular emperors were nonetheless deified, generally when their successor's claim to power was a bit wobbly; Severus deified Commodus and Macrinus deified Caracalla. \n\nBut it made me wonder: How long did these imperial cults persist, especially if the emperor in question wasn't actually all that popular during his reign? Was their still and a shrine and a priest dedicated to, say, Claudius in the time of the Severens? Once the soldiers that had served under him had retired, was anyone still a big enough fan of Caracalla to leave an offering at a shrine to him? Were later emperors really maintaining a whole cavalcade of temples for every single one of their deified predecessors, or was it more that their own dynasty and their most exemplary predecessors were still worshiped, but some of the lesser lights gradually faded away?",

        "text": "As a background, I'm occasionally reading one of hardcore ideologists of the \"Russian spring\", who is currently working on a \"ultimate history textbook\" that is supposed to end all \"liberal approaches to history\", etc. etc. Well, I'm doing it for fun, and because I like to poke at holes in their writings. However, he describes this kind of \"revolutionary idea\" as he claims, that when the humans started prosper, it was not just in savannah, but also in the Siberian tundra. So, the point of the theory is that both savannah and tundra represent a so-called \"grass biome\", which is defined by the following points: no forests, a lot of grass and cereals, which makes a lot of pastures for herbivores, which in turn makes it good hunting grounds for humans. So, he claims that the humans didn't care for the temperatures, but cared for the hunting grounds, and since the tundra before the ice started melting was such a \"grass biome\", it was a good place for humans to hunt, grow and prosper (hunting mammoths and other fauna). So, the \"biome\" jumped to the north, because the ice destroyed the forests, and humans went with it. Then, after the ice started melting, there was flood, and humans started developing in two directions: adapt to water and forests, hunt forest fauna and catch fish, which he calls mesolitic, or a second, create the \"grass biome\" artificially by cutting down the forests, and that's what he calls neolitic.\n\nAs far as I remember, the neolitic period started after the mesolit, and not at the same time, and was marked by using tools to start early processing industry instead of being just gatherers, but maybe my understanding is also outdated (by 30 years or so).\n\nSo, I'm curious, how in line with modern science is this \"grass biome\" theory? Is the guy really a historian with a nationalistic flavour or is he a total hack?",

        "text": "Hello! My wife and I were talking and she asked if I knew how our current calendar came to be. We know 365 days in the year is based on the Earth's revolution around the sun, and (we think) months are based on the cycle of the moon. What we don't fully understand is why months are 30 or 31 days. Why is February the odd one out (leap year?)? Why only seven days in a week? If anyone knows the real historical context around the modern calendar, it would be greatly appreciated.",
