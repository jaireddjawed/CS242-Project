        "text": "Hi all, hoping some people further along in their careers can read through this and give me their thoughts-\n\nI’m a 2022 bscs grad from a decent (T25) university and my relevant work experience is currently 8 months at an ai startup in SF (1 billion valuation/ 250 employees). At the time this was a big opportunity for me because I didn’t have internship experience so a six fig fully remote offer was basically a dream come true. But these past couple of months I’ve been thinking I need to switch places for the following reasons/concerns:\n\n1. I’m worried my experience won’t be relevant moving forward. The tech stach is a bit strange in that I’m using relevant technologies (python/aws/docker/kubernetes/GHA) but I’m developing in their own home-built framework so I feel like I’m only gaining experience in their specific tech. And for the deployment technologies, I don’t really build/modify anything with docker/kubernetes/aws/gha, I just interact with their existing setup to monitor my. code, do builds, etc. - does this even count as experience with this technology? \n2. The work is mind-numbingly boring. Their products are automation software for revenue cycle, they have me implementing the business logic and writing the drivers to interact with EHR’s (RPA). Even though we’re supposedly using scrum, I feel like I context switch on a daily basis at minimum, jumping from product to product to fix their sh*tty codebase that gets broken over a tiny ehr UI change. I think I average like 2 small PR’s a day for bug fixes and it’s probably been 2 months since I actually wrote code for a new product. Every day I wake up to someone pinging me with a new production blocking bug that I need to tackle right away. This white knuckle development is burning me tf out. Is this normal? Or perhaps normal for a startup?\n3. I feel like remote work is extremely bad for my mental health. Right now I’m just living with my parents stacking cash but I meet basically no one new. I have a few hobbies after work but I feel too tired at the end of the day/ week to push myself to go out and meet more people. Not sure if working in person would help with this problem or not, would appreciate insight here. \n\nHow long should I stay at this place? I haven’t tried applying to places since last spring so I don’t even know how easy it will be for me to get another offer. Basically the only positives I see from working here are the great (for me) pay and the flexibility of not having to relocate somewhere. \n\nall advice is greatly appreciated",

I imagine you get questions like this all the time, but I figure that everyone's situation is a little different so it doesn't hurt to ask.\n\nI have a Master's degree in mathematics and am currently self-teaching Python. I think my training in math is helping me pick up programming quickly, but I still have a lot to learn.\n\nObviously, I'd like to be employed as soon as possible for financial reasons, but I understand that I won't be able to just jump right into a dev position given how much I still don't know about (especially now considering how saturated the job market is). So I'm wondering what my best course of action is.\n\nIn particular,\n\n- Are internships worth looking into? I don't mind starting from the bottom career-wise, but a lot of postings for internships seem geared toward those still in college. Is being a student a hard-requirement?\n- Has anyone else switched from math or another non-cs but STEM field into software development? Do you have advice about getting ones foot in the door?\n\nI'm happy to answer any specific questions about my background/experience/whatever if that would be helpful. Thanks so much!",

I work in the tech industry as a computer programmer, and to me exploring unknowns &amp; understanding new interesting details brings out my full joy in engineering. And I can't help it, it's an innate part of me. Is it just me and my possible-but-undiagnosed ADD, or are there others who don't fit the mold at work but are still quite capable craftsmen? Rather than \"fix\" this behaviour, how did you harness and make a successful living? What are my options here?",

        "text": "This is my first role out of college, I graduated smack in the middle of the pandemic and had been applying for 6 months before getting this role so I had to take it. After 18 months I've began to regret not waiting it out for a more SWE related position. I am currently in a junior DevOps role at a bank and while I'm able to complete the majority of my tickets I honestly hate my work, my standing on my team and my confidence in myself as an engineer.\n\nThere is little to zero documentation on any of the processes, meanings, why or what's of our systems. What does exist is usually put together awfully and is not indexed correctly meaning I can't even search for information I need without asking a senior or mid-level engineer every time and I hate doing so. It's been 18 months I feel like I should have a better understanding of all this stuff than I actually do. We work with Kubernetes, OpenShift, Docker, Jenkins, etc. but I still cannot tell you what exactly all these things do in conjunction with one another. To make matters worse I was originally hired to do programming related work but 1.5 years in now and I haven't coded a single thing. My work entirely consists of YAML files basically and I've gotten incredibly rusty with my programming skills. LeetCode Easy is giving me problems level of rusty. \n\nIn addition my company has fired or had quit 4 different mid or senior level engineers in the timespan since I joined and 2 of those were people who were immensely helpful to me at the beginning of my stint. The remaining mid-level and senior engineers and those who have been hired since barely interact with me no matter how much I try. I will message the lead engineer for the team with questions or things to review and he will just leave me on read. \n\nI have my performance review coming up in a week and am lost. I am individual contributor on the work that is assigned to me usually and don't require much help but on things I don't know of that are larger tickets there is nowhere for me to go to find information. This role has stunted my abilities I feel like and I wish I never started out in a DevOps role. I have zero idea if my review will go well or if I'll be placed on a PIP, this is my 7th manager in 18 months as well and the first manager to actually have worked on the same team as me. What should I do?",

I was not able to understand fully their conversation but do not feel it is polite to cut them off as they are talking in a non-break manner, also my senior colleague offer to pair with me after the meeting to clear some fogs in my head and say he does not want to bother the solution engineer before trying out things on our own after the solution engineer's advice. However when I reach out after the meeting he agree to meet in the afternoon but break his promise by saying he had some deployment to watch for and want to move the meeting to Wednesday,  but Wednesday is a department-wide innovation day where we should work on brainstorming our own innovating ideas to help with product in our department instead of working on task we do regularly, so he did not respond my request to pair up on Wednesday until this morning, saying he did not see it until then. He then proceed to say I can reach out to someone else as he is away from work and will be back on Monday. Now I am in a pretty difficult situation and could not progress on the story and I also do not want the team know I am not able to make progress. I have been thinking on ideas on how to approach this situation:\n\n1) Approach the solution engineer again for clarifying question on what they talked about on Tuesday. Saying that my seniors are not very respondent and I had to cycle back to him for question, With the bad impression that it will look bad on me for lacking ability to understand task and work indepdently\n\n2) Actually pair with someone else to work on the ticket, but how will they know about what the solution engineer suggested.\n\n3) Wait until my senior colleage come back, but it will also look bad on me as I am not able to make progress, working on another story is not going to be feasible as these story are not done.\n\nWhat is your advice to minimize damage on my part?",

I did read through the FAQs, I’m just unsure of where exactly I want to go and I don’t know too much about jobs in the field, just what interests me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHey everyone, I was looking for some guidance or advice and to see if anyone could point me in the right direction? I’ll keep it brief, but I’ll add some extra info on my interest’s bellow in case it’s relevant or helpful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’m in my 2nd year of a psychology major. I was diagnosed with Autism and heavy ADHD last year. I’ve found that I excel at working with people over the internet but struggle with face-to-face communication. It’s incredibly stressful and difficult for me. I’m trying to figure out where I want to go that might fit in with my troubles. I have always had a very keen interest in learning to code. I really enjoy modding games and learning how to create mods and such. I love tinkering with things, and watching/learning how code works and fits together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI spoke to my university, and they directed me to two programs, one Being IT and the other being Bachelor of Design and Interactive Technologies (Apps &amp; Interactive Systems Development). It’s important to me to have a comfortable income, I don’t need a high-end, super high paying job. Is there anything out there that doesn’t involve a lot of face-to-face communication? Is there anything in the field that anyone might recommend? There seems to be so many pathways and it’s a bit overwhelming. I realise this is only a hobby and there might not be anything there, but I thought I might ask :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Extra Info:**\n\nI love to mod games; I love to pick apart the mods to see how they work and how the code fits together. I have no idea what I’m looking at, but I find it super fascinating. I have a love/hate relationship with finding and fixing bugs, I’ve spent hours tinkering with games I’ve modded to weed out bugs on many occasions. I’ve used various resources over the years to learn to code in game creation as a hobby and really enjoyed it, I just never had the time to fully commit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got into some general mod groups for some of my games and they have spent hours kindly letting me pick their brains and teaching me how to create mods, specifically how to code them. I spent a lot of time using their tutorials about general mod creation and 3D modelling and loved it.",

When I check my LinkedIn, I see that my former recruiter has viewed my LinkedIn profile. Not only he has viewed it, I've noted this is the third time that he's viewed my profile in the past 2-3 months. \n\nAfter contemplating for a few minutes, I decided to check the company webpage to see if they were hiring someone of my position in the area that I'm at (you know where I'm getting to.) Turns out they are hiring 2 people who are Software Engineer level 1s, but one of them is in California and the other one is remote (none in the particular area that I am in), but none in the Triangle area that I am currently located in (they are also the same subteam I am in). \n\nBut I have this feeling, if a recruiter looks at an experienced engineer's profile, does that mean that they are looking to replace said engineer? I know that this slight increase in hiring was common since my manager actually said they will be hiring more people to support the company's products. \n\nI have been doing my job but I think I fall slightly behind the development matrix so maybe that's something to really analyze, look at the checkpoints, and self-evaluate and honestly self-assess my performance at this time. Almost all of my tasks I do complete on time, but I have lost jobs in the past when I was a high schooler so I always have that baggage on my shoulder. On the plus side, I do have a work conference I go to next week that is paid for by work regarding development, so I'm not sure if they think I'm a lost case yet. \n\nDoes this mean I need to step my game up? Should I be looking for a new job in this competitive market? What steps should I take next? Recruiters, do you have any take on this?",

How do you compare Canada also?\n\nTLDR: Recommend a country for work based on this personal data\n\nCurrent place: Norway Previously: Switzerland\n\nSwitzerland: pay is good, language sucks, limited number of jobs, living large is not easy, high cost of living\n\nNorway: pretty much same with Switzerland except for the pay.

        "author": "New_Supermarket_5490",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/113kxqv/princeton_cs_phd_vs_job_in_a_top_indian_quant/",
        "text": "**TLDR:** Can not make up my mind on whether I should go for a CS PhD at Princeton or go for a job in a top Indian Quant firm as a trader paying 100 - 120K USD per year.\n\nHey all! This is my first major Reddit post as I wanted to get some fresh perspectives into my situation, and I think experienced people on the internet will be my best bet to solve this dilemma.\n\nMy profile: Old IIT CS UG CGPA: 9.5+ 1 co-authored publication at a non-top conference in my area of interest\n\nI personally did not think my profile was worth getting admits in the first place, as the field is indeed competitive (not AI and related stuff though, it would come under systems), although I did work hard on my SoP (not work my ass off though). My recommenders were a well-known professor from my uni and in my domain and two little-known assistant profs (not in my domain). The idea was to test the waters this term (I only applied to top unis and unis, which had fee waivers on the application).\n\nAlong with my lack of confidence in my profile, I did not have any real lab experience before. All my previous research work was done online (in the lockdown) and I had no taste of what it feels like sitting in a lab, grinding your ass off. I am getting this experience right now (I came to a top CS research lab abroad for my last semester and finding out what real research experience looks like), and was hoping to use the LoRs and experience I get from working in this lab for a better application next season if I actually like the experience here.\n\nSo far it has been interesting work-wise (but not too interesting which is what I thought research should be if I want to do it for 5+ years in a PhD), and the work hours are long for most of the students here. In general, I found the place boring socially as opportunities to interact with people outside the lab but in uni seem to be limited (not a large Indian crowd here). Not living inside the uni adds to this even more as I have to stay away from the uni at night with a lonely Indian uncle and I constantly think thus is what living abroad might do to you. Thank god to my girlfriend for keeping me sane when I am not working.\n\nBut now, I do have an admit. And from Princeton at that! (Received rejects from EPFL and Stanford, interviewed at NYU Courant, awaiting a response from Cornell, CMU, UIUC).\n\nAfter getting done with my apps I started interviewing for Indian quant firms and received an offer from a top Indian firm for 100-120K USD as a Quant Trader (Median tech salary in India is around 10K USD per year, for IITs its 25-30K per year I guess). Even though these firms are well known in India, I don’t think anyone knows them abroad so I’m not sure what my exit options from these firms will be like.\n\nWhy I find this lucrative is that I do not come from a well-off family and I really want to have a taste of what financial freedom feels like. A PhD will be paying me 40K USD per year, I don’t know how easy or tough it will be to manage with that in the US. Doing a PhD right now means I will miss out on getting a taste of the industry before committing to research. Who knows it is more rewarding for me?\n\nThe thing is: ***I don’t really love anything currently like I do not have some topic in my mind that I absolutely want to work on***. There isn’t that drive in me right now. I would blame this on covid. I didn’t study for shit during those 2 years of lockdown, just cramming up before the exams, and not attending classes. Although I have enjoyed and liked the courses, I have taken in offline semesters. My best-performing semesters (academically) were also the offline ones.\n\nTruth be told I wanted to do a PhD to have an impact on the world by cutting-edge research. Although I think I can start up after a job as well, although now it won’t be much research-focused, but more application focused.\n\n**My thoughts:**\n\nNow, because I do not love anything currently, I feel like a PhD will be a very long time commitment. Although talking to many PhD students here it looks like you can quit a PhD with masters if you don’t like it, they see that people quitting after two years is very rare, and I personally think I won’t be able to make myself quit once I get in as I will always think of the sunken-costs. A job doesn’t have this as it has no finish date in my opinion. Plus I see a lot of people working on PhDs for 7 years. That is scary to me right now.\n\n**It feels like 5 years later I will be at the same point I am currently at, just minus 5 years of my life where I could have tried many different things. After that there would not be much of a chance to explore, just to get something going fast, and there will be an urgent need to settle. I will be letting go of my young years studying. Which feels scary.**\n\nI feel if I don’t like the job, I can always come back to apply to PhD programs. I already got a Princeton admit. Now, I can publish papers at my current lab, and maybe the LoRs I get here and the older LoRs in the next cycles can get me to Stanford / CMU / MIT / Berkeley. That way I will have more savings, and experience, and be assured that I didn’t miss out on trying the industry before committing 5 years to a PhD. And I might get a better PhD admit too. ***Although I want to ask, how random are PhD admits?***\n\nHere is me thinking out loud: If I don’t like the company, switch. If I don’t like the country or the quant industry, do a masters abroad (funded MS, or use quant money), and switch to required industry. If I don’t like tech, go for an MBA (abroad pref), move to VC maybe after that? Are the things that I am saying feasible even? I don’t even known if I want to be in CS or tech after 5 years, let alone a particular area in CS!\n\nI feel that I can not do all this after a PhD. It kills the room to explore.\n\nSo I just wanted to know the perspective of the community on reddit on what they think I should be doing.\n\nMy own Pros and cons list right now of doing a PhD: \n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Will probably be less mundane as I will be faced with new problems at a regular interval\n* Can work on things I am interested in\n* Get to settle abroad\n* Be surrounded by smart people, learn from their experiences\n* Get to travel to conferences\n* Greater freedom and flexibility\n* V easy to immigrate\n* A good research problem/work can lead to exciting industrial applications and can get to a startup quickly. : **This is my main motivation to do a PhD**\n* Its fucking Princeton: can open up a large alumni network, amazing connections, high societal respect, good future research prospects in the industry.\n* Company in India not well known abroad, so do not know exit options and how good they will be.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* It is a very long time commitment. Not easy to exit if you don’t like it: **Main reason to hold back**\n* Cultural barriers in mixing up with Americans. Aware of cases of discrimination (not that imp though). Also, away from home.\n* Low pay for 5 years.\n* Chance of getting extended is always there. + there is a qualifying exam.\n* Missing out on getting a taste of industry before committing to research. Who knows it is more rewarding for me?\n* Work schedule is similar to a quant job looking at the lab and reddit. Even weekends might be taken. (Although people might do it out of interest but it is still taxing)\n* Future of research in my area is a bit uncertain. Problems are getting rarer, and talking to people here it feels like it will dry down in 10 years, so will probably be looking at a new area of interest.",

        "text": "I finally received my first job offer today! It’s at a pretty well-known company in the US, and it’s in Minneapolis with $90000 base and $5000-$10000 in bonuses. \n\nThe opportunity is pretty awesome and unique, and I’m so excited to have gotten the offer. It’s for a rotation program in four departments of SWE over the course of 2.5 years, and to my knowledge, these types of programs at other companies tend to pay &lt;90k. \n\nI really can’t complain about the offer, but I feel like I should try to get more, because I really do feel like a valuable applicant. However, I’ve never negotiated before, and as someone who has 0yrs experience and hasn’t even graduated yet, a big part of me says I should just accept the offer and not risk it. \n\nAny advice?",

I decided to take a risk the last year and get into a pure development position in a different stack/industry.\n\nWell, evidently I failed. My manager told me I am not delivering what is expected from me. \n\nIn my self reflection, part is because I struggled a bit with the job change (I’ve had to learn a lot) while the company expected me to hit the ground running. The other part is because I didn’t concentrate (and slacked a bit) due to personal reasons. I had some health problems during half of my time here and also was finishing my master degree while working full time. At least I got my degree the last month.\n\nThe goals I got from my manager seem kinda reasonable (now I am in a better place in personal regards) but I am very doubtful if I can make it. I feel like shit, very incompetent and that I do know nothing about CS at all.\n\nI am such a crybaby and I am getting a bit depressed. I am very disappointed with myself (my teammates and manager have been supportive and nice) and I am terrified of telling my parents/family.\n\nI think I just want to rant and hear some advice from you. Should I try to succeed with the plan? Or should I just avoid the stress and start preparing and hope I can find a new job? How long have taken you to find a job recently? I am here on a visa so I may only have a few months to find a new job.\n\nThanks for reading!",

        "text": "Hello everyone, I’m an accounting major at a small school graduating in December of this year. I’m heavily regretting going into accounting so I’ve been looking at potentially jumping to cs as I really enjoy learning about programming. I was first introduced to my first language VBA through an accounting professor just over a year ago. He told me it would be good to learn since it could be used to create custom functions, macros, and automate some of the more tedious accounting processes that take up the majority of time of a staff accountants workload. Moreover he gave me this advice because my gpa is really bad at a 2.6. Turns out I absolutely loved writing in vba and solving different problems I’d pull from the internet or set up myself. Long story short I was told by some of my cs major friends vba was an incredibly inefficient language and it was disgusting to look at so I decided to take Harvard cs50 course and try to further delve into programming as I really believe I’m a better fit for it over accounting. I’ve been doing a lot of leetcode and failing tons but learning a lot. Still, I’m no where near where I assume a cs major about to graduate is so is it super naive to think I could land an internship without being a cs major? Should I switch and spend an extra 3 semesters in school over what I would if I just stick with accounting? I’ve heard mixed opinions from my cs major friends on whether or not a cs degree is really all that better than just a degree in general for landing a job in tech.",

        "text": "I work at a startup where I have several roles or wear many hats, whatever you prefer.\n\nThis is a list of the tasks I do:\n\nCloud infrastructure design. My team knows that I usually go the overengieneering way, but I make it in a way that makes very clear how to start in a PoC way, then an MVP, and then a production environment ready for scale. I only use AWS but I always ask for more time to learn GCP and extend my designs into multi-cloud architecture.\n\nCoding. I consider myself an asset close to a 10xer. We use Typescript but when I'm bored I make the same services in Go, Python and PHP. It depends of the usage. For each usecase, a specific tool.\n\nI can solve a microservices in a single nodejs file but also define the project architecture for scaling and with an easy knowledge transfer process in mind (clear code, docblocks, documentation, design dos). MVC, Hexagonal Architecture, Package oriented design (for golang), you name it.\n\nI can take a monolithic system and plan a migration to a microservices architecture in less than 48hs (2 days but 12hs of thinking/drawing in an ipad pro or a draw.io-like tool). For this I use concepts like the strangler pattern like a 90% of the times. At the same time, when I mention that pattern, people has no idea what I'm talking about, they think I came up with the idea but I always  mention the source (Martin Fowler in this case I think). I also give a detailed plan, subtasked and ready to estimate.\n\nI'm the scrum master and PM on almost every project. However that's not a permanent thing. My strategy is simple: We don't need a PM, what we need is the squad rotating the role every 2 weeks and a good use of Jira software or similar, not without calibrating the team for a scrum version that uses only points that are taken from a matrix that combines size/complexity with uncertainty.\n\nOnce every member of the team learns how to handle the methodology, things just flow and we avoid micromanagement from collapsing managers. Every 2 weeks one of the devs takes the role.\n\nI also expose the burndown chart as a daily reminder that we are getting behind schedule or we've overestimated some tasks, but overall to celebrate every day that we are on track.\n\nI also help the design area to achieve concrete definitions of the design system and the ui library. Y lead projects like landing pages and new features not only at a functional level but also at a UX/UI level. I can literally take an e-commerce funnel and design every step, every screen, every request made to the backend, every possible response and every possible screen/modal for that response. Every flow. And I draw it in a way that you have a [diagrams.net](https://diagrams.net) with every screen, every request, every service receiving that request, every service querying a database if there are queries, every cache intervention, every response, every response rendering. All in one single file.\n\nAnd this is the weirdest thing. I literally write all the content for the end user. Not only what you read in the platform, the app or the landing page. I write tweets, instagram posts, and given that I have a lot of experience in Google analytics, I optimize the campaigns, or at least I tell the marketing people what to do to optimize them.\n\nWriting content is something that just comes up extremely easily for me when someone asks me how to say something or what to say about something else. This has been happening to me since an early age and it's so effective that now I'm dealing with new people saying that I use chatGPT.\n\nWhen I take some time for myself I just walk and watch some movie or a streaming series, but it's always things like Silicon Valley, Mr. Robot, Hackers (1995), Takedown (the non-sequel to Hackers), Blade Runner, Blade Runner 2049, the matrix trilogy and the first 45min of the 4th one, animatrix, it's like I stop but I actually don't. I play games like Dota 2 and World Of Warcraft, palyed a lot of EVE Online, and somehow I find it all connected.\n\nWhy I wrote all of this? Because my CEO and my CTO recently told me that they don't know how to name my position. I'm just everywhere making everything. And before saying I'm being exploited in some way or form, my salary is fantastic. If you think I should concentrate on only a subset of everything I do, I'd get bored.\n\nAm I normal? Do you know cases like mine? Is there any name or title for my position? How close am I to burning out to death? Are there any mental mechanisms that just doesn't make me feel any sympthom of burnout?",
