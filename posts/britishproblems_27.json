        "text": " I expect people to be a bit rude to me here as I'm sure this is quite obvious for most people but it's been a  nasty shock to me as a person who has temporarily moved out of London  and up into the northeast. I have never had a car or have I ever needed  one as I've lived in London all my life. Now I've moved up here and have  had a horrible awakening as to the state of public transport in  general. Buses take forever and are chronically not on time or missing-  I'm lucky that my boss at my part-time job is understanding, I can't  imagine how difficult it is for people who god-forbid have to do this  every day- do they just get fired for something that's not their  fault??? Drivers are mostly apathetic- just this morning a mum and her  small daughter were running for the 7:30 bus that came slightly earlier  than usual at 7:24 and the driver saw them and just drove away- the next  bus is at 9:15!!! It's no wonder stagecoach, arriva and gonortheast all  average 1 star reviews on trustpilot.\n\nFurthermore, the shops that aren't supermarkets close so so early here- at 4:30 the  high-street becomes a deserted wasteland and I just wait until the  weekend to get most of my shopping done which is carefully timed of  course so I'm not out in the cold for half an hour waiting for the bus  that may not come...\n\nIf anyone wants to have a whinge with me about this or tell me that this is old news feel free!",

As you can imagine it wasn't a glowing reference but was all factual.\n\nThe company flagged the review and basically said \"didn't happen\" and as I was unable to 'prove' there had been dealings with the company (my mum was cold called, scammed out of a payment and then a second payment was taken, no paperwork was ever sent) the review has been taken down.\n\nThere were other reviews on there very, very similar to mine and they've gone too.\n\nTrustpilot is clearly a waste of time and cannot actually be trusted.",
