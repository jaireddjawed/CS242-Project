So when me and this guy are texting and I can feel that the convo is kinda dying out I’ll usually kinda end it by not contributing a ton, then he’s also stop contributing, so I just assume the convo is over. Then like 10-20 minutes later he’ll add another 4-5 word response to the last thing I said even if the last text in the convo was sent by him and very similar to the new one. Is he trying to reinitiate conversation or is he just responding late? And should I keep replying after that gap or just let the convo die?\n\nSorry if this is hard to understand I’m bad at phrasing things.",

I've tried, for so long, to try and not be so socially anxious or shy around people, but I can't change it. I just don't get why people have to make it out to be such a horrible or weird thing. I'm sorry if I sound frustrated, but I just don't get why can't they just leave me alone and mind their own business",

I kind of took this at face value and was sad because I like her, and she's not stupid by any means.

        "text": "TL;DR: Friends tell me I give off intimidating vibes and they were scared of me before they got to know me. What traits might someone have that make them seem this way and how do I correct it? People have always noticed I'm smart and quiet and I feel that contributes to the problem so I want to become more outgoing but don't know how. Tips?\n\nI've gotten to a point in my journey with social anxiety/social skills where I no longer feel anxious about talking to people or having a conversation. But now that that's over, I need to actually learn social skills lol I would say what I struggle with is making friends with people I'm not familiar with (like outside my classmates) and specifically approaching people and it's something I have to force myself to get good at because, according to my friends I have right now, I give off very intimidating vibes lol\n\nAll my life I've been told that people were kind of scared of me before they got to know me which is of course shocking for me because as someone who's always been the smallest of my peers (and allegedly has a \"babyface\" lmao), I feel like I'm nothing to be scared of but my friends say I give off those vibes. So I realised maybe this is why people don't really approach me for friendship and it's something I have to start doing on my own. \n\nSurprisingly, the few friends I have all mostly came to me first and made the first move but they are a few people who I guess took a chance on someone \"scary\". The others, we became friends online first then started talking at school and stuff. \n\nOne friend told me part of it was that people think I'm smart which intimidates them but I don't know if that would be an issue outside of school/people who know me from class and there's other really smart girls who are well-liked and known so I must be doing something wrong lol. I've also had situations where people assumed that because I was quiet (always been kind of shy/reserved) I was judging them which kinda saddens me 'cause that's not what was going on.\n\nSo how do I stop coming off as intimidating? What about me might make me seem that way to other people (like in general, what have you observed about people like me in your life)? And how do I learn how to approach others and make friends that way? I never know what to say or how to approach people. Thank you for responding in advance.",

People form cliques, settle into their friendships, and often get busy. I stop getting invited to things and people stop following through on ‘let’s get coffee’ arrangements. I meet people who I really click with, and for one reason or another, they’re unavailable. I’ve been told that I seem too busy/like I have so many other friends, but that’s not true.

        "text": "Hey everyone. I'm willing to take some flak for this stance, because I really believe in it. Socializing online is such a different experience, it's really not going to give you the awesome benefits of an in-person social circle (which YOU CAN do with some practice, I promise). \n\nI've posted this before but it never got a lot of traction on this sub, so I'm hoping this takes off. \n\nHere's the guide I wrote and a bit of my personal story. I have made SO much progress in confidence, capability, and taking better care of myself. This has led to some really great friendships where I am comfortable and strong.\n\nSo, I was the only child of divorced parents. I went through multiple moves and several school transfers. To say I stuck to myself as a kid would be an understatement. I was quiet and extremely reserved when I was young.\n\nI tried to come out of my shell during high school. I overcompensated in college. And I finally found a good balance in my late twenties. I am now thriving and feel very blessed to be surrounded by dozens of friends, a few lifelong brothers, and weekly social events.\n\n**Why socializing can be difficult, and how it can be improved:**\n\nConnecting is difficult for many of us. This is especially true for individuals with certain upbringings, personalities, and environments. If building relationships is painful, people often convince themselves they don’t need it. *The lone wolf mindset is an optional method of survival, but it falls short. The truth is, it takes a community to thrive.*\n\nThere is nothing negative about being quiet or enjoying solitude. Some of life’s greatest joys can be found within that environment. But your mental health will suffer if you don’t balance solitude with socializing. It is crucial to build close friendships and struggle through life together.\n\n**Socializing, for me, means spending time with people you enjoy in a relaxed environment. Ideally, this happens in-person, based around a healthy activity, and with the same group of individuals.**\n\nFor some people, socializing comes naturally. But, those same people may struggle with solo activities such as exercising, meditation, and other personal mental health skills. For others, socializing may feel difficult. Thankfully, it can be learned and enjoyed just like anything else.\n\nA good workout takes energy. You might be tired afterward. But you see exponential benefits over time, and you are always happy you did it. This is how socializing might feel when you first practice it.\n\nHere are my most broad pieces of advice, and I can try and offer some more detailed ideas in the comments if you want. \n\n**1)** **Start by engaging in small talk with strangers and coworkers.**\n\nSome say small talk is “too shallow” or “boring.” But, that’s the point. Small talk is a simple back-and-forth “handshake” between two human beings who want to feel more comfortable with each other.\n\nThis “shallow” exchange is a way of looking for something to connect on, or to have “in common.”\n\nCommenting on the weather is one of the broadest ways to connect. To start small, practice initiating conversations that may seem silly to you right now.\n\n**2) Look for teamwork-based events.**\n\nFor those without a lot of social skills, standard parties and networking events can be draining. I HATE these, lol. And I'm in the business community, so I have to go to them a lot. The only purpose of the activity is to socialize with strangers. There are other ways to begin fun relationships.\n\nLook for events based around a common goal. This might look like volunteering, sports teams, classes, or book clubs. A common goal makes it easier for organic friendships to grow. It's okay to go to these things solo the first few times (like say, a rock climbing gym). But by your third visit and people have noticed you coming in, just start saying hello. \n\nAsk the front desk person how their day is going. Tell someone good job. Move into a, \"So, where are you from?\" and you'll be off to the races. It's awesome. \n\n**3) Focus on building a few close friendships.**\n\nEven the best socializers have many acquaintances, but only a few close friends. Spend time and effort to find them. This means proactively inviting each other to events, keeping in touch, and eventually sharing your struggles. Finding the right people for you will make this back-and-forth exchange easier.\n\nThere are many common social cues, phrases, body language signals, and other topics of conversation to master. Studying these cues through books, videos, and interactions will improve your confidence and strengthen your mental health. When you feel comfortable socializing, be sure to include it as part of your new routine.\n\n**One of my favorite challenges:**\n\nWhen I want a little boost, I will shoot out a random text to a friend, or even someone I haven't heard from in a long time.\n\nSomething like, \"Hey, hope things are going well. Just thought I'd say hi. I've been doing \\*things\\*. Anything new with you? No worries if I don't hear from you, talk soon.\"\n\nPhrasing things in this way means I don't get offended if I don't hear from them. And I still reached out and did my part of making a connection. Usually, these turn into just 3-4 text exchanges. That's plenty, not everything has to go the distance. I do this with many people through the year.",

When I saw I this 0 effort  from her I felt like until this time my whole efforts where nothing.....\nBut as more time passes  I saw her approches  eventough it was 1/5 , I acknowledge  it 'cause approaching someone is a  real big deal for me, you have to aware of getting ignored. \nAnd now our conversation  is still ceased .",

But we weren't even cool like that. Just an associate, not a good friend. I had social anxiety and I still do\n\nin my Early adult years i was being more social but my voice was hardly ever valued. Now at age 28 Im reverting back to my childhood years when I was always quiet. I won't speak unless somebody got a question to ask me. I can sense that people's whole demeanor towards me changes after I stopped socializing. When I stop being smiley with them and kissing their butt, trying to beg for their attention, they get to acting funny. \n people take my silence and introverted nature for being full of myself, arrogant, stuck up.\n\nNowadays I'm only social on forums like this cause I'm anonymous behind a computer screen. Where You people can't judge my appearance,  you can't judge my voice, the way I carry myself and the way I move. You know nothing about me therefore I'm more comfortable expressing myself online.\n\nBasically Im tryna figure out why a lot of individuals mistake my silence as a negative thing, as if I'm stuck up or got an attitude for choosing to keep my mouth shut around them.\nWhat's the matter with people",

It’s too complex to explain it all. But the truth is that we talk on the phone for hours every day, for years, so I want to think that he doesn’t *hate* me. However it’s like he’s with me out of obligation and as soon as we’re not together again or hang up the phone he just ignores me, like he’s tired of me.\n\nHe always takes forever to reply, hours, sometimes he’ll just never open my messages. But he’s often online and I can see how he connect several times an hour and my message sits there unopened, and I just can’t understand it. Who is he talking to? Why is he ignoring my message? Does he see it and think “how annoying”?\n\nFor example today he took the day off work to be with me. I live very far away and every now and then come all the way just to see him. Even though him taking the time to be with me would be considered the bare minimum, I still decided to send him a message to tell him I appreciate it. This was 6 hours ago and he never opened it. Even when just a 3 word reply would suffice. But he’s been on messenger, Instagram, Snapchat, so he’s clearly talking to others, just not me.\n\nSometimes when we’re together and he’s on his phone I can see him opening messenger or Snapchat and see that my message is the only unopened one, and I just don’t understand why.\n\nLike I said this is just one of the many things he does that make me feel this way. I’m very sensitive and he’s extremely apathetic. But he’s not like this with everyone. If he connects every 20 minutes he’s clearly talking to other people, but why does he ignore my texts? I’m sure he doesn’t hate me because no one talks to a friend who lives out of town every day for years out of obligation but this sort of behavior makes me feel very insecure and overthink.",

But I feel like the only person in the whole world who can't even develop the most basic social skills no matter how hard I try.\n\nI used to have friends in school when I was 8. After that age for some reason I stopped growing socially and I couldn't keep up with other normal kids in school and it resulted in me becoming an absolute outcast. I was the easiest target anyone could find, I was short and skinny and had zero friends or defense mechanisms. I was so retarded that I didn't even tell the teachers that I was getting bullied.I kept getting bullied by everyone from high school to university and I still get bullied as a 26 year old. I have 0 friends now, no one to call even if I am in an emergency life or death situation.\n\nI understand nothing can be done about the severe trauma the hundreds of asshole bullies inflicted on me, karma doesn't exist and they will never pay for hurting me. I just want to move on at this point by moving to a new country and start over. But the problem is I am so socially retarded that I don't understand how to get the most basic things done. Even at age of 26 I depend on my parents for everything. I don't have most basic life or social skills necessary to live, like I don't understand how to navigate the hospital or police system, I don't know how banking works, how the legal system works, how to buy a car, how to get a loan, where to buy items that I can't find near me, how to sell property, how to get a visa to go to another country, heck I don't even know what to do if my parents die. I basically don't know jack shit. I live with my parents and depend on them for everything. I need to become independent but I don't know a lot of things normal people know by my age. It's like I am a 5 year old mentally and socially.\n\nI don't know what to do at this point. I am so socially disconnected that I don't how anything works in this world and I don't know how to get the most basic things done to survive in this society. I don't want to kill myself but at this point I have no choice if I can't magically reach a normal level social capability.",

That was a mistake. I'm training myself to have it enbedded in me to never speak again. I could give a damn how anybody feel cause they didn't give a damn bout how I felt. I only know of 1 non relative who embraced me. They care about what I got to say. We have good conversations. Thats my non blood brother.

Am I too depressing? How can I be genuine but also a happier, glossier version of myself?\n\nEven when things are going well, I feel like it’s only a matter of time when shit hits the fan in my personal life. And I can’t pretend to be happy, and neither do I want to burden someone with something so heavy so early on. And even with strong friendships (of which I have precious few), people can only take so much before they get tired of it.\n\nI truly believe no one owes you their time or their care or their friendship. If I’m depressed, and I don’t feel motivated to see them or keep up communications with them, it’s completely understandable and within their right to not want to continue a friendship that is unfulfilling for them. After being there for me 100 times, it is totally fair for them to draw the line at the 101st time and decide they need more positive company and no longer want to share my burdens.\n\nAnd I’m good at being alone. Truly. I enjoy my own company, and when I struggle with something, I rarely share with people, fearing it may be the last straw for them. I am generally quite good at self-soothing. I am known for being a generally positive, cheerful, and funny presence.\n\nAnd yet, it is so, so difficult and agonizing sometimes. To not have more friends. To not feel like I can just be me. (I wish I had people to accept and love me the way Eeyore’s friends do for him despite his chronic depression and pessimism.) To not be able to share my struggles more freely and get the support I need. To not be able to take that leap of faith and to be vulnerable with people. To fear rejection.\n\nRejection happens. I know. To get close to people, you have to be vulnerable, I know.\nI’m just scared of the day that rejection will hit me hardest on a day when I most am vulnerable, and that it will do irreparable damage to me. I really hate living like this.\n\nAnyone relate? Anyone have any workarounds? Ways to deal?\n\nI already have a therapist, by the way, ho ho ho. Yes, I will be sharing this with them, absolutely.

The thing is many people won’t just randomly share shit about themselves and I think I force intimacy upon people. It’s like I really want that closeness but realistically it’s not possible with this person I just met. So as an example there’s a guy that I noticed I shared a lot about myself with. He was being a good friend giving me a listening ear but because he didn’t share as much about himself it felt more like a therapy session than a friendship. He told me we’re a good fit bc he’s quiet and I talk quite a bit. The thing is that makes me uncomfortable and I really want us to talk an equal amount. This dynamic where I’m the talkative one makes me feel narcissistic.",

I’ve never been good at making small talk with adults, and whenever I did it always felt uncomfortable. With teachers, I could never actually talk to them as humans but only as teachers, and I was only able to get referrals from the teachers who saw me as the sweet quiet student. However, we rarely even talked about anything, all I did was say Hi sometimes or ask questions about the class, but I never cracked a joke or made a genuine connection. It’s really hard for me to do that. I know that growing up with my background shouldn’t even be an excuse, but more of an environmental issue/social issue. During these networking events, I don’t know how to talk to them without sounding stiff and too formal. I see the way my peers talk and they seem so relaxed. They are full of energy and somehow act formal while also being so likeable, and I get envious everytime. I attend a more prestigious college, so many of my peers have grown up with successful adults around them, working at companies, etc. I never knew an adult like that, so going into these interactions feels so scary. I don’t know how much informal is too much, and I’m terrible at seeming fun and likeable but also smart. I’m not that scared to talk to them but I feel like a robot when I do and that they don’t really feel a connection with me. I’m not sure what to do, any tips? I’ve been to around 4 of these networking events within a year, and I just attended one today and felt shitty again.",

I found out from hearing my Mom on the phone with my brother yesterday about him having a kid. My brother is also friends with him too but I guess he considers him a closer friend than I am to him. It just hurts how I wasn't even told about something really important like that where it makes me think I don't mean anywhere as much to him as I thought I did. There's been other times in the past that he did some things I didn't like but I overlooked them like we were supposed to go on a trip to California years back but then like 6 months to a year later he went with others &amp; I found out about that on social media. I'm just feeling like I'm being disrespected &amp; I'm strongly considering not talking to him anymore. My main issue is if I cut him off I'd rarely have anyone to talk to anymore since my very few other friends I rarely talk to anymore due to life circumstances. I'm not sure what to do since the downside is I'd feel very isolated not having anyone to talk to anymore on a regular basis.",

I actually initiated this meetup and organized it. That night, my friend asked me if I could hang out with him and his boyfriend over the next few days because they would be near my neighborhood. The day we were thinking of hanging out, I was out all day, and I was pretty tired, so I invited them over to my place instead. We just decided to do it later.\n\nMost of my 'friends' in this city, I'm not extremely close to. Personally, I'm okay with meeting them once every month.

I definitely check in with them via text way more often, maybe twice or thrice every week.\n\nDo you have any advice or tips? Or am I just overthinking?",

My main reason for doing this is bc I have depression and when my friend was telling me about her brother's behaviour it sounded a lot like depression too so I decided to make a gift despite not knowing him AT ALL to cheer him up. At the time I didn't realise how weird it looked, I'm a girl and he's a guy and thing is I have 0 romantic interest, we're literal strangers  to each other. Anyway now I look back and get embarrassed bc I definitely looked like I had a crush on him and I put effort so someone I didn't know. Nothing came out of it, I didn't even give it to him personally (his sister did) and we still don't talk which is ok. anyway was that weird and I'm justified in my cringing?",

If I can avoid socialising to stay in my comfort zone I will, it’s not like I can’t, I just find it mentally exhausting and a bit daunting so it’s more out of obligation rather than choice. Going to uni has helped a lot with it, but I’m still not quite there. \nHowever while I’m pretty good at talking to other guys, I’m still awkward asf with approaching and talking to girls, I just lock up, all my humour vanishes and my responses become bland so I come off as being really boring. The same goes for approaching them even, like eg the other night I went to a club with a couple mates and even just queueing for the cloakroom there were 4 girls making pretty persistent eye contact with me and sort of looking me up and down, one was even dancing and (presumably) purposely brushing her back against mine even though there was loads of room around us. I’ll maintain eye contact back or smile at them or or ask them how they’re doing or whatever but for some reason beyond that point my brain just stops working as soon as I realise I’m getting into uncomfortable and unfamiliar territory and I’ll go back to my friends. Like there’s so many available girls there and I’m getting literally exactly what I’m hoping for yet I never actually act on it, I’ll mentally be on the edge of giving a compliment or starting a conversation but I always end up pussying out.",

        "text": "In a group of friends (7 people, we are all about 19-20), we are organizing an end of year trip to Asia. Everyone but one friend was invited by me and another organiser. This last friend is a bit of a wild card who kind of hangs out with us sometimes, isn't super close but also not super distant either. He's a great person, kind and smart, but is obnoxious in that he ignores social cues a lot and really likes to talk at, rather than to people. At a friend's birthday party he spent an hour and a half explaining the ins and outs of his engineering management job to me personally, to which I just replied \"yep\", \"hm\" and \"ok\" for what felt like an excruciating eternity before he went to another person and repeated the process. \n\nI'm torn on whether to invite him, thinking that it might make the trip worse for me and everyone else, but that it is also cruel to not invite him. Asked other friends going on the trip and some aren't keen on inviting him (they say he doesn't fit the \"vibe\") and some don't mind. \n\nShould I invite him? And if I do/don't, how do I handle not telling him or drawing boundaries in a non harsh way on the trip?",

The club hasn’t officially started so rn it’s just his entire friend group so I feel kind of like an outcast. I went last week because I was asked to go and even though I was pretty socially awkward, everyone was nice. The thing is, I don’t know if I can go next time. I only ever go places if I get explicitly invited with a time and place. Would it be inappropriate for me to show up?",
