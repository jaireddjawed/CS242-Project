        "text": "What I want to know is how these two (Hasan and Ethan) are related to Andrew, and more broadly to the \"leftist\" online sphere (?). \n\nSo, these 3 young men are kinda famous on Reddit. I probably wouldn't have heard of them without being a redditor. Although I've seen their names and thumbmails and occasionally even heard a few \"takes\", these 3 were still very obscure to me until recently. I did watch Andrew Callaghan's documentary \"This Place Rules\" last week. And today, I read about accusations of sexual violence made against him. \n\n(I'm NOT asking about that : there is a OOTL post from 3 days ago which you can read here -&gt; [\"What is going on with Andrew Callaghan (All Gas No Breaks/Channel 5/This Place Rules) being accused of sexual assault?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/106jueo/what_is_going_on_with_andrew_callaghan_all_gas_no/)). \n\n I never took the time to \"investigate\" who Hasanabi and Ethan Klein are and where they stand nowadays in the \"leftist\" sphere. After hearing about the accusations against Andrew, I went to the /r/Channel5ive subreddit for the first time, and I stumbled upon their names. I wasn't surprised to see that Hasan had reacted ([Post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Channel5ive/comments/107yiyf/hasans_response_to_the_allegations/)), because as far as I know, Hasan is a \"leftist online commentator\". But I was surprised to see Ethan Klein from H3-something being somehow involved as well. In my mind he was NOT related to this leftist sphere, far from it? But maybe things have changed, quite recently? \n\nBasically, I just thought  I would pop up here and finally try to get a better understanding of who these two guys (Ethan and Hasan) are. As I have a feeling I will keep seeing their names over and over again, even though they never seemed very appealing to me (but hey, that's okay, I'm not here to argue about their respective values, I just want to understand why they're still so famous and connected to one another).
