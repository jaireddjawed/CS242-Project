        "text": "\nBack in high school, I was a nice(er), less cynical person than I am today. I would try to help people out in small ways if I could, just to make someone’s day better. However, this incident definitely started me down my petty path.\n\nOne of my ancient tires on my ancient car was looking a little bit low, so I went to a gas station to fill it back up. I pulled into the spot, and about 30 seconds later, another car pulled up next to me. As I’m getting out, I notice that in this other car, there are two older ladies (not super old, but maybe around 60), and a toddler in the back. The toddler was throwing an absolute tantrum. Crocodile tears, banging her head against the seat, yelling, the works. The ladies both looked worn out, and I felt bad.\n\nI got out, put my quarters in the air pump, and filled up my low tire. It only took about 30 seconds, and there were still several minutes of air left on the machine. Inspiration struck, and so I walked up to the driver of the other car (who had since gotten out of her car to wait for the pump) and I ask, “excuse me, would you like for me to fill up your tires for you?”\n\nIn reply, I got the following: “Um. No. Do I look like I need some man to fill up my tires for me?”\n\nI was pretty dumbfounded. I didn’t know how to respond at all. So I just didn’t say anything and went to put the hose back. However inspiration then struck again! (although this time it was much more petty).  Coincidentally, my other three tires were also looking a little low. So, I spent the next few minutes meticulously checking and filling each one. I even hit the original tire again for good measure. Anything to run out the clock until the air (that I paid for) stopped. The lady saw what I was doing and was clearly pissed. She was saying something angrily to her friend in the passenger seat and giving me the stink eye the whole time. Probably cussing me out behind my back, but I don’t care. I was clearly just a string bean nerdy kid trying to do something nice for her, and she gives me that crap? Fine. I’ll drag this sucker out and she was NOT piggy backing off my quarters. Then I just got in my car and drove away.\n\nMy only regret is not getting to say the perfect comeback (which, as always, I didn’t think up until later on the drive home). “I wasn’t offering my help because you’re a women, I was offering it because you’re old!”",

        "text": "A few years ago my wife and I lived in a gated community. The community was operated by a larger management company who also hired a separate security company to man the gates to let people through. All the hoops to jump through when there was a problem was a major inconvenience but we didn’t have too many issues…..until we were nearing the birth of my first child. We were two days out from delivery (had to have a c-section so we knew exactly when she was coming.) My wife had invited over a bunch of family who would be out of town on the delivery date and this was our last chance to see them. As they were arrived I was waiting by my phone for a call to let them in. I got a call, but not from security, but from her grandfather which was strange. See there was one major problem I always had with my gate guards, they never could read my phone number correctly. I cannot fathom what was wrong and checked multiple times to see what number they had, but every time we had guests they always dialed the wrong number. It was never an issue though because the person we were waiting for would usually call me and I could directly call the guard and get it resolved. I never made a larger fuss because the guard never made it an issue…..until today!!! The idiot misread my number. When he got no answer he told my wife’s grandfather to leave, he called me and I called the gate guard to say let them in \n“No he needs to leave.” \n“I’m calling you directly from (xyz address) check the system you called the wrong number, let him in.” “I already checked the system he needs to leave.” \n\nThis argument continued for maybe another minute and I am baffled because I have never met a guard too dumb and stubborn to just check again when I’ve called directly. So after a moment an idea clicked. At the time this happened the residents were using clickers to get through the gates in a residents lane. There was one main rule: don’t follow behind people and let them in. So my revenge was pretty simple and very satisfying. \n\nI told my grandfather in law to wait nearby. I had him pull up first in full view of the guard. I made sure the guard was looking and it was clear he could see it was my grandfather in law in the residents lane. I loved the baffled look on his face as I opened the gate for him and the dumb look on his face as I drove up, flipped him off and went through myself \n\nTo make sure that he didn’t call a tow I had my grandfather in law use my personal space (which was never monitored unless a resident complained.) I then went online and wrote a lengthy complaint about him. I don’t know if he was ever reprimanded, but I never saw him in the area again. \n\nTL:DR - Gate guard was being an ass. I broke the main community rule to let my family bypass him and flipped him off as I drove by.",

So all the cast members here have the city they are from on their name tags.

He’s telling me about the weather in places, favorite restaurant, parks, and all this with a smile on his face while talking to me and ignoring her.  Again she says “Some people are in a hurry,” and he just keeps ignoring her.\n\nMy bag is checked now, but he’s holding it, and with a smile asks just keeps going.  The girl is now looking really annoyed, and as he’s handing my bag over, he says “you know, I didn’t check I might have missed something, let me check one more time to be safe.”\n\nHe spends another 30 seconds looking through, then hands it over and wishes me a Merry Christmas.  As I’m walking away I look back and he’s having her completely empty bag, so he can check it with a big smile.  \n\nPettiest revenge in the least sad place in the world.",

Please lemme know if there's more suitable sub for the story :)\n\nWe might have the one particular person in family that always overestimates and overreacts to time. Leaving at 7am for 10am event even when it's just 15 minutes drive, turning back clock to half an hour earlier, and so on. In my case, it was my mother.\n\nFor example, my mother always says false time to scare us to the point it's not even funny anymore. Screaming we were late for 8am event and the clock was ticking at 6.30am... when it was actually 6am in the morning. Yeah, one could justify so we could arrive on time but it's another thing to berate personally with false time. Everyone was hurrying to prep things up only to be annoyed when it's just 6am. In the end we would depart at 7.30am anyway so no point in that. Then came the point mom needed to be put more sense.\n\nNow I'm playing with her rules and put the taste of her own medicine by claiming even earlier. It was 11am event in the neighborhood (10 minutes drive away) and mom did the usual antic at around 9am claiming it was already 10am while running back and forth preparing herself.\n\nThe only thing she didn't know was we already prepared earlier and hopped in the car while claiming we were super late so there was no reason for mom to linger around longer in the house. Panic, mom spend 10 minutes of haste makeup and clothing while running to the car. I sped my way to the venue and arrived way too early for the event... at around 9.30am. We were dressed properly while mom had spotty makeup and mismatched shoes for the event.\n\n\"Why did you make me hurry when it's not the time to attend the event yet?! It's damned 9.30am!\"\n\"Well, it's 11am *your time* currently so here we are\"\n\nSuck that time, mom.\nShe stopped doing the antic now.",

        "text": "So I got a side job as a Float dialysis nurse in a clinic. I picked up this job because that region was desperately in need of a Nurse who would be able to work at different work starting hours ranging from as early as 3am to as late as late as 9am. I picked the job because the recruiter offered to pay me a $10k sign on bonus. \n\nUnfortunately the staff float manager (Steve) was not a healthcare manager. He was a former restaurant owner whose restaurant had shut down during COVID. I was scheduled to work 2 to 3 times per week for 12 hours shifts. Sometimes I woke up as early as 2am to open clinics (most people won't do that) but I was used to working such hours. Steve often made errors in the monthly scheduling of staff to work certain clinics in that region but the float team decided to give him some leeway because he was new to the industry. \n\nSteve once again made a schedule error on one particular month and even while I was on vacation, called me and pleaded with me to kindly cover for some days the next week even though I was supposed to be off on those days. Because of his desperation, I decided to do him the favor. I was scheduled to work a particular clinic at 7am about 3 times that week. \n\nOn my first day going to work in that clinic, I got stuck in traffic on my way to work and had to arrive at about 7.30am. I called the clinic ahead to let them know the situation. Remember, I was not supposed to work on that day but it was simply me doing Steve a favor. When I arrive at that clinic, the charge nurse was pretty angry with me for arriving late even though I had called ahead and informed them of the situation. Unknown to me, she reported my lateness to Steve.  \n\nAfter working throughout that week and covering all the clinics Steve begged me to cover while cutting my vacation short, I got a call from Steve summoning me to the float office. I didn't know why I was being called but I went over to see him. When I arrived, he told me that the charge nurse of the clinic reported my lateness to him and recommended that I be written up because I was not there at 7am. Steve then pushed a write up document to me and notified me that he was writing me up for lateness. \n\nI tried to hide my shock and explained the entire situation about calling the clinic to notify them of my lateness prior to 7am. I also reminded him that I was actually doing him a favor by cutting short my vacation to cover for the emergency. He said he was sorry but had to write me up. It seemed like he was trying to establish himself as an authority because he was new to the industry and needed to add a few notches to his belt. I asked him if he really was going to write me up for this. He said, \"I'm sorry but you leave me no choice.\" \nI smiled at him and said, \"it was nice working with you Steve, I quit. Goodluck filling my position.\"\n\nIt was at that moment that Steve realized he had messed up. The company had spent 6 months trying to find a nurse who would fill that position before I accepted it. My words made Steve realize how much he had just messed up and made a very reliable employee just quit a position that had been extremely difficult. Also my quitting was going to make him look bad before management because he was just new on the job and had already lost one employee. \n\nSteve tore up the write up sheet and told me, \"Ok please can we just forget about everything that just happened. Forget about this write up and forget about this conversation. I really need you right now because it is almost winter and clinical staffing needs are rising.\" \n  I replied politely, \"I'm sorry Steve, I quit. Have a nice day.\" \n\nSteve asked me not to leave and began to actually beg me to stay. I understood how bad it would look on him because the position had been transferred to by management. The former float pool manager was a Filipina who was one of the sweetest ladies I have ever met. She managed and grew the float pool team for two years successfully. And just two months after handing it over to good ol' Steve, he just lost one reliable employee in a crucial position. \n\nI felt sorry for Steve but since he tried to screw me over, I was going to do the same to him. I stood up, took my stethoscope from the treatment floor and left the building. This was back in fall of 2021. A few months later, I called a fellow nurse who still worked on the float team and asked about Steve. They said he had been fired. I smiled widely at the news.",

        "text": "I've had a lot of issues for years with one of my neighbors parking their cars on my driveway. To be very accurate, it's not their cars, but people visiting them. Typically family. His father in particular is very annoying and also particularly indifferent to my complaints. The neighbor himself is actually okay and we get on well enough.\n\nMy driveway is wide, it can fit 4 cars easy, 6 cars if you pack them, so I guess the size of unused real-estate was tempting considering how lazy people are. They can park their cars about 60 yards away in a small parking area. Last year in particular my neighbors father would park there at any time, for any reason. Even when I was home. He is getting old (\\~75) but he isn't senile, so this just pure belligerent behavior. Calling the police isn't helpful, they won't do much. \"He's just an old man.\", \"It's private property, we can't tow the car. You have to get it towed at your cost.\", etc. In general this isn't a problem they are very interested in and I am not keen to really push it that far. He parks there because it's a shorter walk and \"it's how we did things in the old days\".\n\nWell, last year crossed some lines so I did get a sliding gate installed this year. It's a really solid one, commercial grade, on rails and with steel bars. I didn't really want this gate, but given my driveway is quite wide this is the one they had in stock and waiting for the right one would take weeks and I was just about done with the constant annoyance. In fairness, whenever I'd call or text my neighbor they'd come and move the car(s). but...it was annoying as hell. \n\nWell, it's Christmas 2022 and we went to visit friends. Last year they were at our place, so this time it's their turn. But, I did forget to close the gate. \n\nWell, one thing worth mentioning is that there is a switch on the wall. This switch closes the gate. You push it, it closes. But it won't open it. To open it you need the key, the remote OR to open it from inside the house (with a code). And it's December, so it gets dark around 4:45pm. Around 5pm I get a message from my neighbor. Actually I get about 10. And then a call. He is in a panic.\n\nI checked my video system to see what was going on. What I see there is absolutely glorious in it's splendor! His father parked there about 2pm. Then around 3pm some other family members came in TWO cars. Around 5pm (dark outside) a fourth car with guests pulled in and, obviously looking for a light, someone pushed that button. And the gate closed. \n\nWe won't be back until Tuesday. \n\nThe phone call was hefty, but I just had to be direct and tell them they KNEW not to park there and they did so anyway. Probably one of them will make the 4 hour drive to where we are now to pick up one remote and then drive 4 hours back. On Christmas day.\n\nI don't even know if this is revenge, as they did absolutely everything by themselves, but it sure feels revenge-like to me right now!",

        "text": "My neighbor is a royal pain in the ass. He doesn't work ( he's on some sort of disability that doesn't seem to be a physical one) mows his lawn at least once a week, and sometimes more frequently than that. Our lawns are separate, except for a small border, about eight feet long. The entire plot between the end of my driveway and his lawn is about an eight by ten or twelve rectangle. The rest of the border is a small wooded island between, so we only touch grass at the end where the street is. He had his property surveyed soon after I moved in, because I was mowing slightly over the line, and the survey stake with the flag has been there for the last five years. He would walk over when I was outside and mention that my lawn needed to be mowed, even though it was not overgrown. More than once I thought about letting the patch grow, a bit just to irritate him, but that would lower me to his level, and I came up with a much better petty revenge.\n\nI had a conversation about this with a friend who does groundskeeping at a local golf course, and he recommended that I kill the grass on the small plot and reseed with Bermuda grass. If you've ever seen the green on a golf course, it is kept very short, and the grass is lush and thick. So in the early summer I did exactly what he suggested. I made sure that I did not cross the line when I sprayed with Roundup, and he had a fit when I had a bare patch. I prepped the area and put some Bermuda sod down (four rolls at $10 a roll) and watered it three times a day until it took hold. Watering that small patch took about two minutes. \n\nNow comes the fun part. Bermuda grass can be cut very short, much shorter that he could mow the fescue grass growing on his side, and it pissed him off that my grass was now shorter than his. And my lawn there was lush, thick, and very green, separated from his by a very straight line of demarcation where the survey stake was. Imagine a putting a putting green in the middle of your yard; the contrast was striking, as it is on the golf course. He tried once to cut his grass short where it met mine, but it created dirt spots because you can't mow it as short as Bermuda grass. \n\nFun part number two. Bermuda grass spreads, sending out little tendrils along the ground and also underground. They merged into his grass but you couldn't really see them unless you looked for them. By the end of the summer they had infiltrated a short distance into his grass, but it wasn't obvious.\n\nFun part number three. Where I live, I'm not far enough south that the Bermuda grass is active all year. Around the beginning of November it goes dormant, and turns brown. So my whole patch was brown all winter and a good part of the spring. It looked like dead grass (he told me more than once it looked like I was going to have to redo my patch in the spring) and maybe I should read a book on how to plant and grow grass first.\n\nAround May my (dead) lawn there turned green in a matter of a few days. Because the color is different, and it had spread onto his side, the line of demarcation was no longer straight, nor was the nice Bermuda grass only on my side. By mid summer about a foot of his side was basically Green and lush, but he really couldn't whine about it, because it looked nice. When it went dormant in the fall, his yard had \"dead grass\" also. \n\nFour years later there is no demarcation between our lawns other than the survey stake with the little flag on it. I carefully mow just my side, to keep it short. He now adjusts his lawn mower to keep his Bermuda grass short, but it just makes it look like my lawn goes much further over than the stake suggests. Next door neighbor no longer complains to me, but the neighbor on the other side gets to hear it and keeps me up to date. \n\nSummary: Neighbor whines about my grass growing too long so I plant grass that stays short, but spreads.",

        "text": "I’ve been solo traveling the past 3 months in south east Asia. These past 3 months I’ve been staying in hostels/dorms with anywhere from 6-12 other random people and have not had any issues with anyone. Sure there have been times people coming back late at night, people packing up early morning, and the occasional hookups. For the most part though people try to be respectful and not disturb others while sleeping.\n\nThis happened a couple weeks ago in the Philippines. I checked into a hostel and was put in a 8 person dorm room with a group of 7 guys that were all doing some work program together and were taking a weekend trip. They go out the first night and come back at 4am and make a ton of noise which was annoying but thought it might be a one time thing. No…\n\nThe next night they go out again and come back again at 4am but this time they make absolutely no effort keep quiet. They were absolutely hammered. In fact they turn on all the lights and they say to each other “haha were probably waking up that random in our room but f*ck him”. I was PISSED! Not only did they fully wake me up but I also had to be up early the next morning and was really trying to get a good nights rest. \n\nA circus ensues for the next 2 hours which included them playing music, having other people they worked with come in the dorm peaking behind my curtain into my bed saying “who tf is that?”, drunk wrestling, and them all taking showers at 5am. One guy passes out in the shower with the door open and their friends just leave him there like it was normal. \n\nFinally I had enough. I aggressively jumped out of bed and told them all to stfu (this isn’t the petty part). I went to the bathroom grabbed the guy that was passed out drunk in the shower by his collar (he was still clothed) and threw his ass into his bed with his clothes completely soaked. All the guys just looked at me stunned and they can tell they just woke up a bull in the china shop. I then went and shut off all the lights and told them all to get their shit together. It was aggressive but I was so mad at how inconsiderate these people were. I could hear them snickering at me in the dark after I had went off on them. \n\nNow to the petty part…. I tried to sleep but at that point my adrenaline was pumping and there was zero chance of me getting another hour of shut eye before I had to leave, so I started plotting my revenge. \n\nAbout an hour later I hear everyone passed out snoring. It gets really hot and humid in the Philippines, so I go over and grab the controller to the room’s A/C and cranked the heat all the way on high. Then I take the controller and throw it under the passed out guys bed where it would be extremely hard to find. Next I pull off the curtains off the sliding glass door (it was a removable cloth curtain, I didn’t destroy the hostel) and threw that under a different guys bed. Finally I start to get ready as loud as possible to return the favor to these drunk/hungover assholes. I cannot describe the satisfaction I felt as I heard all the groans from these dudes getting woke up “early” as I turned on the lights and slammed the door shut on my way out. With the heat cranked up, the bright sunlight coming in, and no way to cool down; I knew these dudes were going to have one of the most miserable hangovers of their life. Enjoy the sauna and fresh sunlight f*ckers! \n\nFor good measure I went to the front desk of the hostel and let them know of the circus these guys had last night and requested that I change rooms because they were so rude. I came back later that day and was met by the manager of the hostel who was super apologetic for what happened. Not only did he upgrade me to a private room for free, but he also let me know that he had thrown the guys out of the dorm for causing a ruckus and losing the remote/curtain. I said to him “have you checked underneath the beds? They were throwing stuff around all night”. They found the controller and curtain, thanked me for helping, and led me to my new room.\n\nYea maybe I went a little far and sure you can call me the asshole, but revenge had never felt so sweet. The thought of these guys sweating bullets in a heated fully lit up room while being massively hungover has me smiling to this day.",

        "text": "Years ago, there was a \"Celebration Station\" in Austin.  One of its attractions was go-karts in a figure-8 loop, with a bridge in the middle, so you could continuously drive around the figure 8 without encountering any cross traffic.\n\nAs a dad with teens and pre-teens, this was good solid fun.  But there was always some 10-12 y/o Mario Andretti wannabe, who didn't quite grasp all the concepts and physics involved.  This allowed me to perfect a training maneuver that I probably employed at least half a dozen times over seven or eight years.\n\nI was good at picking the right line and blocking on the curves, but as a dad, I was a bit heavier than the average participant, so on the straight ramp up to the bridge, most of them could pass me.  All well and good, part of the fun.\n\nExcept, there was that occasional youngster who thought I needed to be punished for my temerity in keeping them back.  So, as we neared the top of the bridge, and I was going slower and slower because of my weight, these kids would squeeze me to the side, literally brushing up against my car and pinning me along the curb.\n\nI'd ease off the gas and wait until they (still steering into me for all they were worth) would have about 3/4 of their car ahead of me, and then I'd gun it, put my weight into lunging forward, and sharply turn away from the curb.\n\nThe result?  Their car would spin and get stuck, nose straight into the curb, on top of the bridge where all their laughing friends had a good view  of their predicament.\n\nThe cars had no reverse, so there they sat until one of the employees came out to set them free.",

        "text": "I was reading a story about a woman's petty revenge at work and it reminded me of the time I maliciously complied with providing information to my manager.\n\nThis was years ago and I no longer work for the company.  I should mention where I worked was a retail store and we had paid breaks that we were allowed to leave the store for. It was in a strip mall surrounded by other stores.\n\nMy break time comes and a manager asked me where I was going on my break. I told him \"To the restroom.\"  This kind of irked me bc he's never asked me this and it's none of his business.  I was also on edge bc I had a customer that was sexually harassing me daily and management did nothing about it, so I didn't really want to deal with them.  He then asked why I was taking my purse with me. I made sure to say it loud enough to where everyone could hear it \"Because I'm on my period and don't really feel like walking around the store with a tampon in my hand. Are there any other personal questions you'd like to ask me?\". He stammered a \"No\" and briskly walked away with his face beet red. He never asked me an embarrassing question again.  I finally got tired of the harassment of my stalker and embarrassed the guy in the store too by yelling that I had already told him I was uncomfortable and told him to leave me alone, which he did. \n\nI later found out after quitting that job the stalker was banned from the store's chain for harassing other girls. That manager was also fired.",

Old grouch comes up, hits my ankles with her cart, and says \"Can you get the fuck out of my way?\" and just walks past me down the isle.  I sort of shrug it off, find my wine, and start to head out.  Passing through the produce section, there she is bumping carts and pushing her way through to get her things.  I cannot stand people like this, so I put my asshole hat on, snuck up, plucked the frozen turkey out of her cart, and swiftly returned it to the now *empty* turkey cooler.  I take an alternate route to leave, and happily check out with my two items and head out.\n\nThere are two things I am 100% certain of.  One, that turkey was scooped up as soon as I turned around.  Two, there is no way she found another turkey that wasn't in a can.\n\nI was unashamedly an asshole, and will giggle about this for years.",

First I stole her charger so she wouldn’t have an alarm in the morning for work she got a warning from her boss, Then I started switching her alarm times cus she wakes up at 8 am so I changed that to 8 pm it’s hilarious watching her freak out because she’s late then a few other times for fun I started hiding her shoes or her hairbrush or her apron. But then I stopped for a bit because she already had 3 warning and on the 4th one she’d get fired but then she broke my tv and said it was an “accident” So by “accident” I threw away her apron  (where she works you need uniform) and she showed up to work without her uniform but she didn’t even get a warning she just got a new one 🙄, So I hid her toothbrush and 2 pairs of her shoes she was stressing trying to find them when we needed to go to church. Then I stopped again but started recently because she started kicking me out of the house (like telling to go play outside or chill with the neighbors kids) or sending me to my tias house when her ugly ass boyfriend or her musty basic friends are over. What I did today is something I should really start doing when I mess with her, Today her bf was over so I started playing Cupcakke on Alexa and she got fed up with this and just left the house so I got to stay home alone while she was gone I switched her diet coke with normal coke and just other little thinks that will make her lose her mind. If you think this is annoying it’s just sisterly love ❤️\n\n\nedit- you realize all the rude comments or the stuff you delete i can still see cus of my email ?? 😭 LMAOO y’all goofy asf ☠️\n\nedit 2 - glad you decided to delete ur musty comments “u/arrouk”",

I see two entitled women (40s) talking in front of the doors that the workers use to restock the store. The entitled woman look at the worker with the distain of royalty being interrupted by a filthy peasant. The worker with here empty supply cart again tells the entitled Bee’s that she needs to get though. Again the entitled woman blow her off with pursed lips and a dirty look. Now I have a particular sensitivity to people mistreating workers and these Bee’s have disrupted my delicate sensibilities. I walk past the entitled woman snagging one of the carts full of groceries and I take off.  It takes them a moment for them to notice before they pursue me. I quickly traverse The back aisle and turn the corner towards the front of the store. One of the entitled woman tried to pull the cart away from me but I make it all the way to the front of the store before letting go. I make a clean getaway and go back to get my cart. Next to the restock doors is the other woman’s cart. Now before you call me the A-Hole I’m fully aware, but these people needed to be taught a lesson and I’m just the one compelled to step up. I grab the cart and head off to the camping section. I take the cold stuff from the cart. I needed milk and eggs anyway so bonus. Later I felt bad that some Walmart worker would have to restock the cart from the camping section. When I went back the cart was gone.\n\nThis happened like a year ago and didn’t think much about it. The other day I was at a restaurant with my extended family. One of the waitresses kept looking at me. I took me while to put it together. When she walked past I said “didn’t you use to work at Walmart?”. She got excited and exclaimed that she thought it was me. I had a haircut and lost some weight since then. She filled me in on the aftermath. The ladies complained to the manager that a guy tried to steal their stuff for no reason. The manager figured there was more to the story. The entitled women wanted the manager to find me and have me arrested. The worker girl told her what really happened and has since become store folklore. I told her I posted the story in #AITA and got voted the A-hole. She said your not an A-Hole your are a Legend.\n\nMy sister told her another similar story from when we were kids but I’ll save that one for another day.",

        "text": "Ok, admittedly, this wasn't me, but rather I was a witness to the whole event.\n\nThis is probably the most cold hearted, malicious thing I've ever seen someone do on the road.\n\nJust outside of the estate gate of my home, there is a very long stretch of road. Although the speed limit on that stretch of road is 60 km/h, we typically do 80 - 90 km/h by instinct, at least most of us do. However, when someone decides to do 60 on that road, I just patiently wait behind them and enjoy the slower pace of, since I know that the traffic lights on this road are in sync, and going faster would result in catching the red light instead of green.\n\nToday was a little different though, and I couldn't believe how cold blooded this driver was.\n\nBefore turning onto the road, I noticed this white Porsche Sedan that was driving kinda recklessly, and was weaving through traffic. A black mini van was semi in front of the Porsche, and the Porsche tried to skip lanes to get around the mini van it was yet to approach. Unfortunately for the Porsche, this ultimately resulted in the Mini Van to be at the front, myself in the middle, and the Porsche at the back (had the Porsche just been a little patient, they would've been in front of the Mini Van). Note that this Porsche was definitely on the brink of road rage, if not already, with the Porsche flashing its lights, swerving all over the place, and a car horn that sounded it like it was about to break apart from being hit that many times. \n\nSo now we're driving on that stretch of road in that order, and at what speed does the Mini Van go? They are going around 40, or at least I was going 40 as a result. And this wasn't because the Mini Van was having a slow day, but it was clear that this Mini Van was out to piss off both myself and the Porsche. And it was infuriating, but I had enough reason to believe that this was provoked by the Porsche's reckless driving.\n\nSo you can imagine how unbearable it was to have that Porsche stuck behind me, and it was clear that they Porsche was absolutely infuriated, and I was also Pissed since I know that we're going to get a red light at the next traffic light.\n\nAt the end of the 8 km stretch of road, there is a stop sign T intersection, where we have to stop and give way to incoming traffic, and this will become relevant in a second. Somewhere along the stretch of road, I gave way to the infuriated Porsche, and the Porsche was blasting the horn and Lights at the Mini Van, and the Porsche couldn't overtake since it was a blind right turning road (we drive on the left in my country) with too much occasional incoming traffic. The Mini Van looked like they enjoyed Pissing Off the Porsche, and slowed down some more, sending that Porsche in a bit of a frenzy mode.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity, we finally reach the Intersection, and I was planning to do a overtake that moment I finished turning right, which the Mini Van was also planning to do. The Porsche however skips onto the left turning lane to turn left. The Mini Van stopped in such a way that the Porsche couldn't see incoming traffic, and the Mini Van definitely noticed that.\n\nThis is where the Mini Van pulled that cold hearted move.\n\nThe Mini Van lowered their window, and indicated to the Porsche that incoming traffic for them was clear, and the Porsche didn't even hesitate a second, and spun off onto the road, and straight into a Pickup!\n\nThe Porsche lucky didn't roll over, but the Pickup made a solid hit on the Porsche's hood.\n\nAnd the Mini Van? When I looked again, the Mini Van was gone, like it was never there.\n\nI stayed a while to give a written statement along with my contact details, and both the Pickup and the Porsche had a dash cam, which caught the whole event. I only needed to give a testimony to the fact that the Mini Van driver gave that \"All clear\" indication to the Porsche, which was semi caught on camera too.\n\nI've never seen anything like that before today, where one driver would send off another driver into incoming traffic that way, and for what?!\n\nAnyways, I hope this fits the rules of this subreddit. I really wanted to share this and I don't want this to get taken down.",

The guy immediately took about 5 steps alway from the car and he just stared at it for a solid 30 seconds while the horn was going off, completely and utterly dumbfounded at the sudden turn of events. \n\nHe was still there a few minutes later when we walked to our car. Before closing my door I said, “Oh-no, the alarm went off. Let me check the cameras to see what happened.”  Suddenly whatever the heck was on his phone wasn’t so important anymore and he started walking briskly away.",

        "text": "This isn't exactly \"revenge\", but rather a crafty \"I KNOW!\"\n\nSo I'm in college in Oregon in the late 90s.  I had a gf there one fall quarter that turned out to be a bad gf....  \n\nShe was really eager to move out to the East Coast (New Jersey) after graduation - given her appetite to climb some corporate ladder.  I laugh now, but we were SOOO unalike!  Anyway, I got really suspicious of her when one fall Saturday morning I got an anonymous phone call from some strange guy that claimed to live in New Jersey and tell me that my gf was not the sweetheart she seems.  He didn't say that HE was seeing her, but rather, SHE was seeing other people and that I deserved to know.\n\nI don't fully remember the conversation, it's a bit of a blur now (it's been so long), but I was shocked &amp; heartbroken.  I didn't know if this was true OR if it was just someone that didn't like her and wanted to wreck her relationship.  Either way, I had my doubts about our relationship now.  I did NOT tell this gf about this phone call nor my suspicions.  I knew she'd deny it so I wanted to uncover more info on my own.\n\nThe holidays were coming up and she was going to fly out to New Jersey for a portion of the holiday break to visit/tour different companies/possible employers.  She told me she was going to be staying with family friends out there...\n\nAbout a month before this holiday break, I was sleeping over at her apartment.  She was up early that morning to get to class while I was able to sleep in till later that morning.  I noticed her daytimer planner sitting on her desk...  Having my doubts about the relationship, I flipped through its pages...\n\nThe calendar - December 27:  \"Michael!  Flying out to see my sweetie!\"  It was written in purple ink and I think a heart was drawn around Michael in pink highlighter.\n\nThat was indeed the day she was flying from Portland to Newark coming up in a month.  She was going to be there over NYE and back the day after winter quarter started (Jan 4?)  \n\nMy heart sank!  I continued to look through the daytimer.  In the back was an address book.  There was only ONE Mike/Michael...  and it was the ONLY entry with a New Jersey address.  \n\nI wrote down this address!\n\nNOW, for some side information:  I had this art project painting I had done that hung up in my living room above the couch in college.  It was 6ft x 4ft white foamcore board with THIS eye painted on it - https://imgur.com/a/GWxRjaY\n\nI had gotten this image (artist: Piero Fornasetti) off a post card I found in an art supply store.  I had like half a dozen of these fresh unused post cards with this image.\n\nThis gf I had....  LOVED this painting!  She wanted me to either give her my huge, 6ft painting OR paint her a 6ft copy...  I never did...\n\nBut I DID give her something close to it.... one of those post cards!\n\nI knew it took mail 3 to 4 days to go from the west coast to the east coast.  So the day before she flew out to New Jersey, I took one of those post cards I had (with that identical image) and mailed it to her at Michael's address...\n\nI believe I wrote something like, \"Dear Jennifer-  Here's hoping you &amp; Michael have a warm and wonderful New Year!\"\n\nI didn't sign my name, include a closing, or even include a return address.  She'd recognize my handwriting AND she'd definitely recognize the image....\n\nI didn't hear from her at all while she was out there.  School had started in early January and it took a couple days when she eventually called me to come over.  It was kind of ugly (as many college break ups are).  She went from bawling to screaming at me (b/c I violated her trust w/ getting the information about her &amp; Michael w/o telling her?), and back to bawling again.\n\nIt was a painful time for me.  That damn \"In the Arms of an Angel\" sad song by Sarah McLachlan was popular on the radio at the time that winter quarter and it was just tabasco sauce in that wound whenever I'd constantly hear it.\n\nBut, I smile about it now and terribly miss those pre911 years!",

Code enforcement finally shows up and puts the orange 'tow me' sticker on the rig and then cites him for all the trash in his yard and runs his plates/vin# and a couple more vehicles disappear.\n\nNow I enjoy parking on the street in front of our house (legally and safely) and leaving my covered carport and big driveway empty because F that guy.",

        "text": "Where do I start, I’m not a frequent poster but thought my story would fit this sub.\n\nWell let’s start at the beginning I started a thesis project which took about a year (during the pandemic so mostly in home office) I had 2 supervisors one professor and a PhD student. Two people got into the project me and let’s call him \"jack\".\n\nNot to get into specifics about the project or degree the work me and jack had to do was transforming datasets into one big dataset using code. The big dataset would then have been used for our thesis project but we had to create it ourselves. Because the overall project we were piggybacking our thesis of already had started a year prior there were already transformed datasets by other students that were done or still working on it (relevant later on).\n\nStarting the project, I had no clue how to program anything really or use code, compared to him who sold himself as already knowing how to code in different languages. Which makes me quite anxious and resulted in me putting a huge number of hours into teaching me how to do this very hyper specific transformation.\n\nThe way we split work was basically we had group meetings every week because there are a lot of pitfalls especially in the beginning of doing this and each dataset is unique. Basically, we had a pool of datasets we could choose from, pick one and mark it as being worked on. Dataset were very different and some could have been consisting of maybe 30 variables and be transformed fairly quickly while others had 10k variables and could take months (Numbers of variables transformed would be the best measure of work done).\n\nFast-forward, half a year and I completed 3 datasets including one very big one which overall had me transform like 15k variables, took me ages and I still had other courses. Jack on the other hand completed 2 datasets one with 20 variables and one with 50. After I realized this I was stunned because we kind of bonded over the work because it was frustrating and time consuming. For half a year he pretended that we basically were doing the same amount of work and had similar struggles. Well, I thought we still have half a year there is still a really big data set open and I kind of pushed him into doing that so his participation was at least in the 10% range (number of variables transformed).\n\nI continued to do small to mid-sized datasets as I was not ready to provide the datasets for both of us especially with how much work it took. The next few months we had meetings he pretended to be working on datasets even trying to get me to lie for him to the supervisor as we had to cross-check the datasets which I couldn’t do because he never send them. On the other hand, when it came to other issues with the project he always asked to do things together which resulted in only me doing them. When I wanted something from him simple quick things like one line of code it would never arrive ... still hasn't.\n\nAt some point I got very suspicious and started investigating we had a common drive for the project in which you had to consistently add or change stuff when you worked on datasets. I could look into his past edits and realized that he has not been working on the big dataset even though he was known claiming to be done with it. I'm not a snitch and I still am not however after discovering this I changed how to deal with him. First, I started mentioning things like why hasn’t he uploaded the datasets that have been done for months or why am I still not able to check them. Instead of privately asking him about it which is what I have been doing since the beginning but he would always find excuses which I ate up. Well after some passive pushing into that direction the supervisors finally realized he has been lying for the past year and hasn't done shit.\n\nHonestly I expected him to be kicked out right then and there however, he is good at talking and finding excuses as I was the prime example of it working. While I wasn't there when they had a talk I think they made a deal that he had to finish a certain number of datasets before the time is up. Suprise he can actually do it if he wants to, turns out he finally figured out how difficult it was which was evident during the group meetings (Lots of questions and pitfalls that one encounter while doing this).\n\nTo summarize up until this point he basically lied for a year to me and others even after now finally doing datasets he did maybe 10% of what I did. The dataset phase was over and now came the part of combining them and writing the thesis about it. Turns out after having dealt with this stuff for about 400 hours I became pretty good in handling datasets and understanding them (spoilers).\n\nJack was allowed to continue and moving forward we had to combine the data which was transformed by at least 8 different people which as suspected came with a lot of issues. Our supervisors, I guess for me to push him through the project, suggested we do it together ... which isn’t going to happen. I said that I would be faster if we do it separately as I could plan my time better but if we have questions we could help each other (lol sure thing buddy). Our supervisors were very hands off which is the only reason he got away with it that long and at this point. He could not complain to me about me not wanting to work with him as everyone knew by now that he was a liar and lazy (he knew it, I knew it so I could always politely turn him down on any requests).\n\nCombining the data was a shitshow everyone transformed there data somewhat differently using different code, tons of novel issues etc. However, due to me know being pretty proficient in this after doing another 100h of work to put it together without data loss double checking everything and a lot more stuff that’s very specific I finally had the final dataset. I knew jack would never ever get to this point after finishing it plus we had to create slightly different datasets which gave me the perfect excuse not to provide him with mine. Jack in the beginning asked some questions on how to do it which I gave him general answers to but the questions also showed me that he hasn’t even started yet and is still betting on getting my work and using that. Jack also had to continue transforming data because of his lying and I have been determined for months not to help him or provide him with anything and to everything on my own for myself.\n\nDuring the group meetings I first pretended to struggle and not being done yet he always offered help which I knew he couldn’t give (I always said yeah sure and did not follow up on it). After asking a few more times for my data which I either never replied to, said it would take a week or just give him tips on problems he faced he realized he is never going to get it.\n\nFast-forward, we write our thesis I continued to not help him with anything keeping to myself. We get our grades he asked me if I passed of course I did but guess who didn’t yes jack. He sent me why he didn't pass his thesis and surprise surprise if you have no clue what you’re doing because you barley worked on it you fail. He asked me for help in revising his thesis I said sure I could look at but I was on holiday for 2 weeks and said I could help after (I obviously never intended to). We never spoke again THE END.\n\n\\- I’m not a great writer so I hope this is somewhat readable and English isn’t my first language.",

        "text": "TL;DR (Soldier left an unsecured radio in a fastfood parking lot so I called his HQ on and told them what I found).\n\nFor those of you who were ever in the military, you get it: unsecured commo equipment (ie, left alone) is a no-no.  I mean, obviously we don't want the bad guys listening in on us.  So if one does go missing, there will be an installation-wide shut down and up-turn everything everywhere until it's found.  Bad day for any and everyone.  And oh does it suck to be the guy who lost it.  With that little prefacing out of the way, on with the show...\n\nWhile back, I'm stationed at a major army installation (post).  But I'm soon to move to another duty assignment.  Great timing, because the rest of the division is out in the field training. It's a massive 45 day exercise with all the equipment, tents, and vehicles. They treat these events like an actual deployment.  It's pretty cool, they even have mock bad guys to \"shoot\" (blanks).  But since I'm moving soon, I'm not part of the exercise.  I'm \"in the rear\" packing and clearing documents.  At one point, I get hungry and decide it's time for a Whopper. Yes, we have BK on these installations.  \n\nI get my burger to-go.  I'm crossing the parking lot of BK, and a Humvee (Hummer) pulls in real quick. 3 guys rush for the door.  They're in a hurry.  I notice that there's a radio in the mount on the dash. Now, it's not unheard of to send someone to \"the rear\" for specific reason; forgotten equipment, someone forgot medication, got hurt/sick, whatever. But when you do go back for these reasons, you're ONLY supposed to do that one thing, then get back to the field ASAP.  Stopping at BK for some real food is not one of those reasons.  That's also a no-no.  And I get it, I would have run in for a burger, too.  But there's a radio.\n\n\"Hey, you should probably leave someone to watch that radio, man.\" I call out.  The senior man in the group - A Sergeant, like me - points out \"It's locked in there. It's not going any where.\"  And under normal circumstances he's right: One of the reasons we padlock those thing is to keep them from wandering off.  But he's in the middle of a Division wide exercise.  It could have just as easily been an officer or senior enlisted to walk up and find this thing.  \"You're still not supposed to leave those things unattended, especially here, in the BK parking lot.\"  And if he'd been cool about it I would have even offered to watch it for him. But he was a dick:  \"Look, man, mind you're own fuckin business alright. We're in a hurry!\" And he runs in the door.  Okay, let's play...\n\nI go to the Humvee get on the mic of the radio. \"HQ\\[Command name\\], this is \\[humvee bumper##\\], over\" -it's painted on the front &amp; back of the truck- The radio responds \"\\[Humvee##\\], this is HQ, go ahead\". \"HQ, thought you should know, I found this vehicle parked outside of BK on post, unattended, over.\"  There's a pause... \"\\[Humvee##, say again, over?\"  Oh this part feels so good.  \"HQ, again, I say; Humvee## is sitting at the BK with this radio unsecure and unattended.  Thought you should know.  Over.\"  Another pause... \"\\[##\\] who is this?\"  I would have given them my name, but I had to get back to the office and didn't want to get involved. If I'd given them my name, they'd have had me watch the radio and give a report and yadda yadda... Maybe even get the MP's involved.  So instead, I just told them I was a concerned citizen. Then I left.\n\nSadly I don't know exactly what happened to our intrepid little BK eating troops.  I was cleared and down the road by the time that exercise ended.  I don't even know who they were.  But I've got a pretty good idea that their life sucked for the remained of the exercise, if not for many moons to follow.  I know some of you will downvote the shit out of this for me snitchin.  But that's not why I did it.  All he had to do was not be a dick!  How hard is that?  I hope the burgers were worth it.",

        "text": "I was in the drive-through of a Wendy's.  I had a cup of water in my cupholder that I was finished with, and I needed to make room for the drink I had just ordered.  I was the next car in line, and I poured the water out on the ground right next to my car.  When I pulled up to the window, the girl working there did not greet me or read me my total.  Instead, she yelled in my face, \"You can't dump drinks on our building!\"\n\nI kind of laughed in disbelief, not sure if she was trying to be funny or what, and said, Excuse me?\"  She was completely serious. She replied, still fully yelling, \"You poured your fucking drink on our building.  Somebody's gotta clean that up!  You can't come here and do that.\"  I said, \"It's not on your building.  It's in the parking lot.  And it's water.  And it's raining.  Nobody has to clean anything--\" and she cut me off.  \"I DON'T CARE!\"\n\nAt that point, she stormed off.  Her manager came over to the window and asked if everything was okay.  I told him what happened, and he doubled down and launched into a lecture about being inconsiderate and making messes for other people to clean up.  I simply said, \"You have got to be fucking kidding me,\" and drove away without my food.  They were more interested in being outraged over literally nothing and belittling their customers than actually doing their jobs.  They obviously care so much more than the job requires, but not about things that matter, like not treating customers like shit. \n So now, whenever I am near that particular Wendy's, I like to swing through the drive-through--hungry or not--and when nobody's looking, pour a soda down the wall for them under the awning where the rain won't wash it off.",

        "text": "At a much younger and slightly less deserving part of my life I worked in a grocery store where I was lucky to not get shot at work and most of my coworkers were a worse rumor mill than a middle school girls locker room after one of them lost her virginity. I for the most part got along with these people and was rarely part of the rumor mill and when I was it usually wasn’t vicious. It was the occasional “gothiclg thinks (insert name) in (insert department) is hot”. Despite working 60 hours a week on average I liked these people for the most part. \n\nThen came S. I liked her decently and we were close to the same age. I lent her a little money here and there which she always paid back. We spoke as often as we could with a place that was severely understaffed and worked us to the bone. I also got to hear every complaint about her boyfriend and so did everyone else. Her boyfriend, D, wasn’t someone most people would enjoy dating. He had such a bad porn addiction it had ruined several past relationships and eventually got him fired from a job. He had 3 chances to stop masturbating in the bathroom and he blew it. He also creeped most of us out. \n\nDespite my dislike of D and having to give up my only day off I decided to help S and D move their stuff into storage so they could move after his job loss. After 2 weeks of cleaning I came to an apartment that was very clearly hoarded and still smelled of rotting food. Despite not having been a Christian for a long time at this point my “love and help thy neighbor” kicked in and I helped them move anyway. I washed up something like 5 times that night to feel clean, both from the house and gross comments from D all day. I made no mention at work about the state of the house or what D did to me since S was causing enough of her own problems. \n\nMy kindness was repaid by her telling everyone I wanted to steal D from her. She really tried to lay it out like I couldn’t find a better man than hers and that’s the only reason I helped. She didn’t expect one thing: everyone knew and liked me better. When I was finally asked if I wanted D I said no and pointed out how gross she was. I also tacked on if she quit hoarding and took them both to therapy she wouldn’t have those worries. I also pointed out that I was shocked she hadn’t gotten help since 2 other coworkers had stayed the night at her house and were strong advocates for therapy meaning they’d also happily help her. \n\nShe eventually decided to salvage our work friendship but never again tried to lie about me.",

        "text": "I’ve been working for the same company for the last six years (insurance claims management firm) and they had had a contract for a specialized type of insurance for twenty years when I started with them.  Four years after my start date upper management made an error on a claim that blew up in litigation and cost the client millions.  \n\nObviously the client pulled the contract from them after that.. and gave it to their biggest competitor.  See the CEO of the company I worked for originally started working at their competitor’s company, thought they could do it better, and left to found their own.  So from the start they had a natural rivalry.  Also, the majority of their employees under that contract moved to their competitor after the contract left.\n\nI was bummed when they lost the contract because I really enjoyed my job working under that contract and had been working on certifications to advance further that were specific to that type of insurance.  I had to do a 180 to stay with the company because I couldn’t move to a different state where their competitor was located and had do something completely different I didn’t enjoy for the last few years.  \n\nWell, I don’t know why but they left a field team with the company I worked for even though the majority of the contract was gone.  They were very bitter about losing the contract so maybe the client was trying to placate them because they still had contracts for other lines of insurance with them.\n\nBecause I had experience, when there was a large hurricane I’d be pulled from my normal job to work onsite.  When hurricane Ian hit FL they promoted me to manager of that team and said I would receive management pay + per diem.\n\nI travel multiple states away to south FL and my pay contract arrives… with no management pay.  I confronted my dept. head and he said it was manager pay but they include per diem in their manager’s pay instead of adding it in addition to it and refused to budge.  So I made the same as I did as a regular employee but worked in a highly stressful management role over 15+ employees.\n\nI didn’t abandon my team and stayed for the remainder of the assignment to preserve my reputation with the client.  But the client we worked for has wanted me to move to the other company this entire time.. I just hadn’t left because I was under the impression I would have to move states to work for them.  I had completed the onboarding process with them last year in case my circumstances changed, but had not accepted a position with them.\n\nThe company I was working for expected me to go to the field when hurricanes hit and deal with the same bs if I stayed, so I decided it was time to move on.  I called the deployment manager at the competitor’s company and let them know I’d like to resign and work for their company instead.  We worked out an agreement where I can go back to my old job I loved and work from home.  Oh and a $5 per hour raise to boot and better hours. \n\nI resigned from my old company and the dept. head who screwed me over begged me to stay saying they would pay fairly next time I went to the field.  I declined and started with their competitor less than a week later.  \n\nThey are negotiating contracts with the client for the next year now and it looks like the old company I worked for is going to lose the field team I was manager of and it will move to their competitor as well.  Apparently there aren’t many people left who have specialized experience to handle the role and the client decided it was time to pull it.  \n\nI guess that’s what happens when your business model is f*** around and see how little you can pay people and find out whether they will leave.  \n\nTL;DR: I left for my company’s competitor after they refused to pay me properly for a management role and they lost a team to their competitor in the process.  They begged me to stay, but I refused and I’m much happier now.",

        "text": "This is my first actual Reddit post so I apologize if I go into too much detail or my writing is unorganized. \n\nHere’s a little backstory:\n\nWhen I (19F) was a sophomore in high school I got my first boyfriend. When I first met him I told myself I would never date him. Not to be an asshole but he was not attractive at all and was the complete opposite of me. But, he was very funny and paid me a lot of attention which of course I liked. I had never gotten attention from boys. We started dating, he took my virginity, whatever. I think that’s why I was very attached and didn’t leave him sooner. \n\nAfter about 6 months things started to go very south. He was very manipulative and lied. Always. He spent the night one night and got a lot of text notifications at 3 in the morning. So I went to check them. I found out he had been cheating on me with another guy. I was heartbroken. When I confronted him in the morning he would not admit it, told me I was delusional and broke his trust by going through his phone. I now know he was in the closet and was ashamed of liking guys. Regardless you’re a piece of shit for cheating. We broke up after that. \n\nA month later we reconnect at a party and got back together shortly after. When we were together I still did not trust him and held the past against him. We had been on and off. Last Christmas we got into a big fight over something pointless and he had made a comment about giving the presents he bought for me to his female coworker because she would appreciate them more. This coworker of his had previously been a issue in our relationship as he confessed to going to her apartment often and they kissed a few times while we were together. So the next time we hung out I  looked through his phone for some type of proof I wasn’t going completely bat shit and he was still being a little cuck. Of course my instincts were right. I had found a note in his phone. There was a paragraph for every month we were dating. In that note, he wrote how he only used me for sex or when he was sad about his ex girlfriend. That I was and always had been a rebound because he would never get his ex to be with him again. They apparently would still talk, but only to make fun of me and how our relationship was a joke. (I saw these messages between them too) He told her the first time we fucked I had forced him into it. I WAS A VIRGIN AND TERRIFIED I DID NOT WANT TO HAVE SEX AT TAHT TIME. He also told her I abused him and he felt unsafe around me. I was a 16 year old girl, I never hit him. Grow up. He also made fun of my mom dying that past year and I would never find someone who truly loved me. \n\nAnyways I’m so sorry for the long backstory. After seeing all that, I took screenshots, as well as screenshots of explicit texts he shared with the guy he cheated on me with. I made a group chat with his parents, sent them all, and said “doesn’t he make you so proud”? I knew his parents didn’t know he was also into guys, and that his dad was extremely homophobic. I set his wallpaper as one of the screenshots I took then left his house while he was still asleep. I blocked him on everything and haven’t heard or spoke to him since.",

        "text": "Disclaimer: This isn't my story, it's my friend's\n\nMy friend Mike (Fake name) works in IT at the community college we both attended. A few months ago, he asked a girl, who I'll just call Emily if she wanted to go out and get lunch. Emily wasn't just some stranger either, she once attended a barbecue party by Mike's family back in Spring. I was also there, and while so, I observed and could tell Mike had a genuine interest in Emily.\n\nEmily said yes to his request, and they agreed to meet up at the entrance of the Campus around 2. The day came, and Mike waited patiently at the meeting spot. 15 minutes pass, then 30, then an entire hour, yet Emily never showed up. Mike then tried texting her, but never got a reply. Then he tried calling her, straight to voicemail. Next, Snapchat, Instagram, and Discord, and not one single reply.\n\nNow, just last week, after months of silence, Emily finally contacted Mike. However, it wasn't to apologize or even explain why she ghosted him, instead she only contacted him just to ask for IT help. She was exploiting his job position and their relationship just to get free technical support. So now, Mike will respond by giving her the same treatment she gave him.\n\nHearing this story pissed me off, especially since I knew all about Mike's history with dating. His last girlfriend, whom he loved very much, died tragically from brain surgery when they were in High School. It took him years to overcome the grief. He fell into depression, gained a lot of weight, which especially didn't help with the pandemic back in 2020. The fact that this girl betrayed the trust he placed in her with his slowly repairing heart just shows how hard dating really is for men",

        "text": "After several years my boss started being more of a dick then normal when he found out i bought a house. He lectured me about how it was a horrible decision then went out of his way to schedule a meeting asking if I needed more hours. Immediately cut my hours instead of what we agreed on and started hiring new people. It was obvious he was trying to keep me away from new hires and was being secretive. I replaced someone this exact way and knew what time it was. He's a gaslighting narcissist and plays really messed up games but I had been tolerating it because I liked the job itself. Fast forward six months. (That's how long it took him to hire someone who stayed longer than a week.) He just took me off the schedule and blocked my number for no apparent reason. I have a mortgage and three kids. Nice move right before Christmas. So I'm sure he's been enjoying some curve balls in the form of a few state inspectors. \n\nI \"accidentally\" took home his sentimental pen about a month ago then returned it a few days later after he threw a fit threatening to press charges if he could prove who took it with camera footage. He will be receiving this poem tomorrow.  Did I mention he is a germophobe ? The trash cans must be wiped out with disinfectant when the bags are changed every time or he freaks out type of thing. 😉 He's been carrying this pen everywhere.\n\nI found a pen. \nWhat secrets could it hold deep within? \nIt belongs to one called super tweaker on occasion. \nWas it true and I have found the pleasure reaper? \nFor the answer I was eager. \nBoredom had occurred and that was just absurd. \nSo I loaded up that tuber to see if it was a good boofer.\nI spread my crack and gave it a good wack. \nWaited a moment and, yes, this was the component! \nOn cloud nine, the pleasure was all mine. \nThis little pen fit the bill and gave a much needed thrill. \nEcstasy again and again until parting with that sweet little pen.\nNow you have it back and I have a lonesome crack. \nSo when you need some good shit take that rocket in your pocket for a spin deep within. \nYou know you want to.",

        "text": "I grew up in a small town with around 150 people.  As a 17f, I got my first job working at McD's for $3.35 / 4.25 an hour when minimum wage increased.  (1992).  I drove a truck my Dad gave me with bad gas mileage.  I had a younger cousin who grew up two miles away.  She was 14 at the time this happened.  (This was back in 1992)\n\nA rock band with both like was going to play in a large town about 3 hours away.  This was pre-internet, so to buy the tickets, we had to drive to mall 60 miles away where Ticketmaster was located.  My cousin begged to come with me, got permission from her parents, and I agreed as long as she could pay for her tickets.  \n\nAbout a month later, we drove to the mall to buy tickets and she admitted she hadn't been able to earn enough money babysitting money, but she had plans to get a job in a few months when she turned 15.  I agreed to buy her ticket $65, give her enough for an official t-shirt at the concert (about $12 or $15) and she would repay me $100 to help cover a small portion of the gasoline from the two drives.\n\nThe concert was a couple of months after that (around St. Patricks Day) and we had a good time.   I bought us drinks at the gas station and fast food on the way home.  Her birthday was in April and she promised to start job hunting soon, with plans to start work early June. \n\nBy the time June came, she announced being pregnant at 15.  We talked about the money, but she said the morning sickness was debilitating and she couldn't work.   The next summer, I reminded her again, but she had to stay home and watch her daughter plus babysit for a cousin.  She got next to nothing in child support (the boy was her age with no income) and she couldn't pay me again.  Christmas rolled around and someone gifted her $500 but she had to buy all this baby stuff.  The summer she was 17, she was pregnant again, different Dad, and they got married.  \n\nThirty years later, she's had 3 marriages, 5 kids, her oldest son and her second ex have both spent time in jail for meth.  Her kids are out of the house but come back frequently to do laundry and mooch grocieries.  Someone gave her a singlewide, the family helped her fix it up, and it's now placed behind her mom's house so she lives rent free.  She drives a late model, used minivan.   \n\nI quit asking about the money after 5 or 6 years after she loaned it to me.  I resented it because I earned that money working on my feet.  I'd come home at the end of an 8 hour shift and my feet would be swollen, and I'd be mentally wiped out from being nice to jerks all day long.  At $3.35/$4.25 an hour, this represented several days' worth of hard work.  \n\nI live in another state now, but my parents are older and have early Parkinson's and diabetes.  I'm visiting from another state, spending six weeks, from Thanksgiving to New Year's.  \n\nMy cousin now works at the Feed and Seed.  This is a gas station where you can buy bags of horse and cow feed, dog and cat food, and a few basic grocery / home items.  There's a grill with basic food -- burgers, corn dogs, potato logs, made to order breakfasts.  Nothing healthy, nearly everything fried.  It's not exactly like a restaurant -- you order at the cashier and pay, then make your own drink, and when the food is up, the cook passes it through a window to you.  There are 2 mason jars with the names of the 2 cooks and about half the people don't tip.  I usually tip $3 on a $10 meal.  \n\nOnce you have your food, there are four indoor booths to sit in (plus picnic tables in the back with some metal loops for people to tie their horses to.  Very, very rural.)   \n\nI don't tip my cousin.  If she's the one who made the food, I don't tip her.  I've been there maybe 6 times in the past month and about four of the times I was there she happened to be my cook, so that's about $12 I would have tipped if it was anyone else.  She obviously noticed and asked me about it.  \"Remember the $100 you owe me?  I'm taking it from that.\"  \n\nMy cousin didn't say anything, but she went home and complained to her mother (late 60s f).  Her mother complained to my parents (75f and 78m).  My mother promised her I would \"make it right\" and chewed me out for not letting go of something that happened about 30 years ago.\n\nI pointed out she never once tried to help me get the money back.  She bought them expensive baby gifts, takes those 5 kids and some of the cousins to the mall, camping, and even on some road trips to the beach.  They've never once bought gifts for my daughter (this was a low blow because she died 4 years ago and is a sensitive topic for all of us) and that they never bought gifts for my nieces.  She's easily spent a few thousand dollars on their family over the years and the money only flows one way.  That it's okay for my parents to voluntarily make this choice, but I never consented to simply \"give\" her a week of my part-time salary and Mom should have stood up for me.  I also pointed out that Mom knew what a terrible track record their branch of the family had for not repaying debts because they \"borrowed\" money about once a year from my parents and didn't pay it back often enough, but Mom hid that information from me until I was in my 30s.  At 17, I had no reason to be on guard but Mom knew all kinds of red flags.  Dad thought I had a point and told Mom to stay out of it.  He said I could handle it however I wanted.  \n\nWhen I went back to the feed and seed for breakfast this morning, my cousin had a smug look on her face when she passed the food over and looked annoyed that I dropped nothing in her jar.",

        "text": "Sorry to bombard you just before Christmas, but we are currently playing “chicken” with the Bucket Woman over bins, and I wanted to share. \n\nFor those not familiar, the Bucket Woman haunts the house next door to us. It’s unoccupied, a fact that she blames on my underwear. (I wash it and hang it on the line to dry in good weather; scandalous, I know.)\n\nShe’s also fixated on having the bins in by 9am on the morning of collection (known as “Bin Day”). This is how she got her nickname, as my partner, Martin, said it was like living next door to Hyacinth Bucket (“It’s Bouquet”). For record the Council does not give a rat’s what time the bins come in. \n\nThe Bucket Woman is on the corner. Our friends and neighbours, “Cath” and “Terry” live opposite on one corner, and on another corner there are three units. Our Council issues at least four bins per household for waste and recycling. Three units means three times the bins out on Bin Day, and three times the mess for the Bucket Woman. \n\nThis morning is Bin Day. I have a GP appointment, so I put New Human into her pram and walked to the bus stop, which is near these units. While I’m waiting for the bus, I see the Bucket Woman arrive, and take all her bins in (I think she puts them out to make the place look occupied). Then she crossed the road to the units, and began checking their bins. Most of the collections haven’t been done yet, but that didn’t stop the Bucket Woman getting all melodramatic and making exaggerated “Why? Why, Lord, why?” gestures.\n\nThen Bucketty dragged the empty bins off the street and passive-aggressively lined them up in the driveway, and went back inside her place. \n\nThe bus came along, and off New Human and I went. \n\nWhen we came home, there was no sign of the Bucket Woman. I whispered to her: “Looks like the coast is clear”, and New Human and I headed for home. I should add that I wanted to get indoors before the next rain squall.\n\nOnly, as I rounded the corner, I saw the Bucket Woman outside my place. After months of not speaking to us, she chose today to break her silence and talk to me about the bins. \n\nI tried to brush past her, saying not now, I need to take care of the baby. But Bucketty tried to get between us and the gate. (I have no idea how she expected me to get all of the bins, and a pram, around her and through the gate, unless she expected me to grow more arms.)\n\nNew Human let out a cry, so I looked Bucket Woman dead in the eye, and said, “She’s just pooped herself” (only much cruder). Bucketty backed away, either because of my language, or the prospect of baby poo. I ran through the gate, made sure it was closed behind us, and then dashed inside the house. \n\nI’ve decided those bins are staying out there until we are good and ready, and Bucketty will just have to wait. \n\nThe new fence means she can’t bring the bins in and dump them in the driveway, and it’s too tall and spiky for her to lift them over. Those bins aren’t going anywhere until we are good and ready. Which is 9pm, according to the reminder in Martin’s phone, bless his electronically organised petty heart. \n\nWe’re also predicted thunderstorms later this afternoon… Which means the new plants will get a good watering, and so will the Bucket Woman if she's still hovering around like a blowfly.",
