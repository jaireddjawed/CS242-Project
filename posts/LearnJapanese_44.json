Now that I’m finished with it my goal is to return to Japan to work in my field. However, at this point I reckon my Japanese level is roughly N4. \n\nI’ve been thinking about different options for returning, because entry level positions are hard to come by when you don’t live there or your language skills aren’t good enough. \n\nSo my questions are:\n\n1. Does anyone here have experience with long term language courses (like 6 months to a year)? Would you recommend it? What was the outcome?\n2. Is there an immersive learning option? For example working on a farm or a home stay/work option?\n3. Would it be an idea taking a job as an English teacher/ALT and learning that way. (To be honest was an ALT in Japan before and it was not for me and I tried learning on the job but things just didn’t work out)\n\nThanks",

I understand now that the general idea behind RTK is simply to recognize and write kanji, not so much learning the meaning behind them. Thanks for the comments.",

Right now I'm using the Genki textbook series, along with Memrise to practice vocab, and Wanikani to learn and practice kanji. However, Wanikani doesn't give all of the readings for some of the kanji, and I wonder if its really necessary to learn them all up front, or if I can get away with the most common usages first and pick up the others later. TL;DR: Do I really need to learn all of the onyomi and kunyomi for kanji, or are just the most common readings okay to start with?",

For the most part I study using Tae Kim's guide, and I plan on getting Genki eventually. However, while I was browsing the internet on useful resources I stumbled across FluentU. It seems like a pretty good deal to me and I plan on using the 15 day free trial that they offer. But I thought I'd ask just in case as I couldn't find another post regarding this topic.\n\nNow, I've seen posts on this subreddit where people claim to learn Japanese through reading and exposure, while using a grammar textbook as a reference tool. This has me wondering whether FluentU is a good resource for doing this.\n\nBasically, I want to know whether FluentU is good for studying Japanese. What are your experiences with it? And if not FluentU, how exactly should I be studying grammar?\n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated on my end. Thanks in advance!",

I learned hiragana and katakana in about three days and moved on to learning kanji.\n\nI tried out wanikani, but I felt it wasn't really my cup of tea, and so decided to try out rtk 1, and so far I'm doing great.\n\nI'm making my own cards, which have the kanji, and I have to write the meaning, then the radical meaning (if any) along with my story shows up, and I have everything sorted onto colors in that phrase (green for the meaning, red for the \"components\" and blue for the radical meaning of that kanji\".\n\nI am 67 kanji in, and I have no problem recalling any of them, and I'm continuously adding more kanji and radicals to the deck, while also using kanatown to practice hiragana and katakana.\n\nI am wondering though, what would be more effective, learning the most common, or two most common readings whenever I learn a kanji, or going through rtk 1 and then when I'm done with all of the kanji, learning the readings for each one.\n\nI was also thinking of making another deck for the readings as I study them, whether I follow the first option or the second.\n\nEither way, I am not sure if this question has already been brought up in this subreddit before, but when I take a look online, the opinions seem quite mixed. I know I am only just starting, and I am learning at a relatively quick pace, but I don't know if I'll ever slow down, especially since school is starting now, but I don't intend to slow down all that much. I figured I'd ask people with more experience than me about this issue.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEdit: I also write whatever I learn on a notebook, through which I study new kanji or review old ones. When I can't recall a kanji on anki, I go to the notebook, where I also review the stroke order.",

I had two different teachers and they were both really good -- just the right balance between pushing through the N3 textbook, getting me talking (which I really needed), and correcting some fossilized errors. They also took a lot of time before I went over figuring out my exact needs and my level, recommending the N3 Try textbook (which was just right for me) based on some placement test materials and a Skype interview. If you're looking for serious one-on-one or small-class teaching in Tokyo, check them out. Disclaimer: I have no relationship with them other than as a happy student.",

This frustration stems from all the ambiguity in learning a single kanji, all the different pronunciations and all the possible meanings. learning the ins-and-outs of a single kanji takes forever and often times kanji learning sites omit the Japanese vocab and instead tell me what it means in English only; that really goes against the point of learning vocab and kanji in tandem.
