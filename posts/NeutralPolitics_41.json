        "text": "The Senate Intelligence Committee released [James Comey's Statement](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/os-jcomey-060817.pdf) for tomorrow's hearing (June 8). Assuming James Comey's statement is truthful and complete, and taking in all known facts and events to date, what are the legal arguments in support or against President Trump regarding obstructing justice? \n\nThere are those who argue that while Trump's behavior amounts to being \"[excessive and bizarre](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/448386/james-comey-testimony-donald-trump-actions-are-questionable),\" they do not meet the legal burden of obstruction of justice.\n\nObstruction of justice is defined under [18 U.S.C. § 1505](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1505) and committed by those who “[corruptly](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1515), or by threats or force, or by any threatening letter or communication influences, obstructs, or impedes or endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede the due and proper administration of the law under which any pending proceeding is being had before any department or agency of the United States, or the due and proper exercise of the power of inquiry under which any inquiry or investigation in being had by either House, or any committee of either House or any joint committee of the Congress.”\n\nAs [this write up in Lawfare](https://lawfareblog.com/was-firing-james-comey-obstruction-justice) explains (excellent read), there are 3 elements of proof in order to find a crime: \n\n1. there was a proceeding pending before a department or agency of the United States;\n2. the defendant knew of or had a reasonably founded belief that the proceeding was pending\n3. the defendant corruptly endeavored to influence, obstruct, or impede the due and proper administration of the law under which the \nproceeding was pending.\n\nContinuing Lawfare's post:\n&gt; The questions here surround the third element. One must not merely “influent, obstruct, or impede” but also do so corruptly. Under § 1515(b), a corrupt state of mind requires intent: “acting with an improper purpose. [...] Ultimately the answer goes to the motives: Did the President or Attorney General intend for Comey’s firing to “influence, obstruct, or impede” the Russia investigation? ”\n\n",

It seems novel at the very least, though obfuscated some by the fact as far as I know he is still using his personal Twitter account as opposed to the government sanctioned one. ",

Here is an article from February, 2017 containing an example of the discussion I mention: https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/02/logan-act-michael-flynn-trump-russia/516774/\n\n\nRecently, there have been some statements in the press describing how some US cities and mayors, co-ordinated by Michael Bloomberg, are negotiating directly with the UN in order to sign up some states or cities within the US to the Paris agreement with the goal of meeting the obligations of the US federal government, after President Trump has stated that the US will be leaving the Paris agreement.\n\n\ne.g. http://www.smh.com.au/world/bucking-trump-us-cities-states-and-companies-commit-to-paris-accord-20170604-gwjy0b.html\n\n\nThe Logan Act has historically not been enforced [source](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2907523), so regardless nothing might come of it, but I'm curious - does the Logan Act apply here?

        "text": "As a brief recap for those not familiar with the topic, [Net Neutrality is the idea that ISPs should not be allowed to change the way the service operates based on the content being transmitted over the service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality). This policy was enforced in the United States, when [the FCC classified the internet as a common carrier under Title II](http://www.adweek.com/digital/net-neutrality-fcc-reclassifies-isps-as-common-carriers/).\n\n[Ajit Pai, the FCC chairman,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajit_V._Pai) is [for the abolition of the Title II restrictions](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/fcc-chair-ajit-pai-explains-wants-scrap-net-neutrality/). Different people are having different responses--[some news sites show bias in favor](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/opinion/sunday/fcc-invokes-internet-freedom-while-trying-to-kill-it.html?smid=pl-share), and other news sites [show a strong bias against it](http://dailycaller.com/2017/05/17/more-than-300000-pro-net-neutrality-comments-on-fccs-public-forum-likely-fakes/). Note: The previous two links are not used as sources, and only as examples of bias for and against Net Neutrality. The extent of the bias on the two articles may be skewed, as I simply took a sample.\n\nMy question is if the bias for or against Net Neutrality is significantly related to an individual's overall political stance, or if the issue of Net Neutrality lies outside of the political spectrum for most individuals. A follow-up to this question is if it *should* be a partisan issue based off each party's political beliefs, or if neither party's policies contradict either of the positions regarding Net Neutrality.\n\nI believe the second prompt will be easier to discuss, as it requires less knowledge about society at large. However, the first question can still probably be answered by analyzing news articles regarding net neutrality from sites that are known to be biased, or by analyzing the positions of politicians with regards to Title II regulations.",

Saudi textbooks promoting an Wahabist worldview were even [used in the Islamic state](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/26/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-islam.html) before they could write their own (though of course Saudi Arabia explicitly condemns the Islamic State). And of course Osama bin Laden was from a wealthy Saudi family.\n\nSo at least on a superficial level it seems like Saudi Arabia has strong connections to modern Islamic extremism, but I don't know if that is the whole story. How exactly is Saudi money spent internationally used? Are there consistent, provable ties to Saudi-funded mosques and terrorists? What is there online presence like--with so many terrorist attacks coming from homegrown \"self-radicalized\" Muslims living or born in the west, are they connecting somehow to Wahabist religious teachings online, or are online radical communities completely unrelated to the Saudis?",

Furthermore the role it played in the platform migrations of the Republican and Democratic Parties between 1940 and 2008.\n\nFor those not knowing what the Southern strategy is, I feel this wiki has the popular definition. \n\n[Southern Strategy Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy)\n\nMy Query: \n1. Does the Southern Strategy Exist\n\n2. *If not/If so* what evidence is there.\n\n3. *If so* was it a prominent tactic in the platform migration.\n\n4. *If not* what instead played a prominent role in the platform migration.",

Comey, to testify next week about his conversations with President Trump, congressional officials said on Wednesday, setting up a test of the White House’s willingness to cooperate with investigations into Mr. Trump’s associates.\n\n&gt;Putting the highly anticipated hearing on the calendar would force Mr. Trump to decide whether to invoke executive privilege and try to prevent Mr. Comey from testifying. Mr. Comey is expected to be asked about several conversations he had with the president, including one in which he says Mr. Trump encouraged him to stop investigating his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn.\n\nHere's another article about it: http://www.reuters.com/article/us-otc-comey-idUSKBN1862YC\n\nSo I understand why executive privilege exists, but to me the obvious interpretation would be that you can't **force** someone to testify, not that you could **prevent** them speaking.

For example, how many convicted violent criminals have prior drug charges? Data in this vein would shed some more light on the contribution of the Drug War to the overall prison population.",
