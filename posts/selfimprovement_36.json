        "text": "So I've been trying to get myself to be honest with people when they do things to me, or related to me, that I don't like. Before I've been a major people pleaser and wouldn't say anything to anyone. Although a lot of times I don't mind, I don't usually have many problems with others. But when I did I'd still keep it to myself.  \n\n\nIn the process of learning to set boundaries I've both done too little and hurt friends, and done too much and made some friends feel singled out. Basically I've only been open with the people I'm closest too, people I thought would at least take it best. Which a friend noticed, that I didn't get after other people for the things I mentioned to them. It made them feel that they were often doing things that hurt me and singled out for it. Alongside telling me that they also said they wanted to take a step back from our friendship.  \n\n\nI think our friendship will be fine in the long run based on things since then. But I'm having trouble figuring out if I am doing things right. If, in the process of setting boundaries, I am letting myself get too bothered by others. I mean I'm trying to realize people make mistakes and hurt others without meaning too. Not everything has to be mentioned, especially if it's a first time. Still it's hard to know if something is serious that it should be mentioned.   \n\n\nAny thoughts on knowing when to talk to someone about what they did to you? And when to let it slide? I don't want to keep hurting friendships during this process.",

My older brother is much more well-behaved and always gets frustrated when I put chores off. He kept barging into my room and getting increasingly frustrated when I said I would do it later. After the 3rd time I just lost it told him get out of my room. I was angry at myself for struggling so much to do dishes and angry that he was so annoyed that I was messing up yet again. I apologized and finally did my work but I'm worried I'm turning into this deranged psycho who is constantly getting angry. Which is kinda like my mom.",

I think of myself as somewhat capable and talented in that aspect. I don’t necessarily hate how I look but do dislike some thing like my nose for example or little details. I have a good family and currently no friends since Ive tried to cut them off and Ive had loyalty problems with a couple. I want to practice self love by continuing to train and take care of my career by working. How can I do that though? I feel like I just get spikes of motivation that last no more than 2 days. I struggle with sexual thoughts and would like to stop When I have money many times I have seen escorts, not that I have a lot of problem getting girls or forming relationships but it just seems easy and my actions are driven by lust, I dont even watch porn on a regular basis. I want to be disciplined. Ive read to be conscious of activities you like and simply work on them. But everytime I try I end up in the same spot, repeating my bad habits and feeling down because time is passing by so fast and Im not where I wanted to be. I live in my car because Im trying to force myself into necessity for more since I cant find any more solutions. Idk what this is but I simply wish I could follow healthy habits. I guess its just a matter with if you want it bad enough or not. I just want to be the person I envision in my dreams  Not this 19 year old loser, I think Ive lost some drive I had when I was 16/17 but I just cant get out of this state. I want to be more focused and driven but its hard. I know im human and should be able to do what others can but why is it so hard for me? Why are these urges to follow bad habits so strong? and the urge to follow good habits so weak? I started reading The Daily Stoic in hope of getting some clarity but couldnt go more than 3 days in a row doing it. Currently Im in my car, a little drunk from a stolen bottle and simply want to change. Im not sure if someone out there feels the same way but if you would like to reach out I think we can help each other. I just dont know what to do anymore. Im so angry and disgusted by myself.",

        "text": "One of the hardest things to do in life is to forgive somebody that hurt you or an injustice that's been done to you. \n\nWe tend to hold on to something because, we have this resentment or judgment of something that has happened, and what's happening is that it's actually creating a lot of very negative energy in our bodies that we continue to store.\n\nAs long as we continue to hold on to negative energy in our bodies, there is little room for something new, something clear, and something better to enter.\n\nThrough the power of forgiveness, you're releasing the negativity and allowing for something better or something new something clearer to come into your space.\n\nBy choosing the path of forgiveness, you aren't condoning what has been done, you're not accepting what was done as okay. It's not okay. The act or the way someone made you feel isn't okay. But what you are saying is that I will release this negativity from my energetic field.\n\nForgiveness is a powerful emotion that can help us to heal and move forward from difficult experiences. It can be hard to forgive someone who has hurt us, but it is possible to get on the journey to forgiveness. In this video, I'm going to share with you some practical steps that you can take to start to forgive someone who has wronged you.\n\nWithout forgiveness, it's hard to create the space you need to live at peace. You need to release the negative feelings, negative emotions, negative energy, in order for new and more positive energy to come into you.\n\nWhat many don't realize is that when you forgive someone, you're giving yourself a gift. Yes, it helps the other person too, but you forgive someone for yourself. By choosing to forgive, you are choosing to create space for positive energy to come into you and for you to truly move on.\n\nHere are my tips for forgiveness:\n\nStep 1: Choose a relationship where you're struggling. Set the intention to forgive, not condone, but still forgive.\n\nStep 2: Visualize the person and say, \"I forgive you and I release you\". Feel into that for a few minutes, and do this for one to two weeks. You will notice your energy shift bit by bit, which will make a difference over time.\n\nStep 3: Forgive yourself. Is there a judgment you're holding onto about yourself? Examine that, and if there is, then visualize yourself and feel into \"I forgive myself and I release myself\". Your energy will shift over time.\n\nI hope this works for you. It did wonders for me, but it did take introspection, a true intent to forgive, and it took some time for my energy to shift about a relationship in my life.",

Unfortunately, that's mainly my bff. This girl has been through thin and thick with me, really heavy stuff, even tho how she deals with things is not how I prefer, the way she empathizes always feel cold and distant. \n\nEvery time I tell her I like a guy or that someone might like me, she gets so very frustrated, puts me the hell down and is just extremely negative about it. With time I grew very tired of that, felt that she was being jealous, and that grew in intensity and frequency. Until I just decided to not talk to her anymore.\n\nThe last straw was that every time I get annoyed about anything that's silly and stupid, instead of joking about it or just saying sorry, she either stops talking to me for weeks or gaslights me, that I'm imagining things or blowing things out of proportion. \n\nI'm a very easygoing person, but I like to be respected, and like to feel good when I talk to my close group of friends. \n\nI feel guilty bc right before I stopped talking to her, she was like \"I know that you'll never stop talking to me out of nowhere I trust you\". She was kinda love-bombing at that time.\n\nI feel guilty bc I don't wanna be her friend anymore, I got a new job and the group of friends that I started having there are supportive and loving and kind. I like to think that I chose to have that around me, bc I made an intentional change and I changed as a person.\n\nThis friend just left the group chat which was the only thing left that we had in common. I also wanna say that last time we talked, she's the one who refused to speak to me, I am consistent, always, she's not, right then I vowed to not reach out again and let her have it her way.\n\nI'm just sad and disappointed.",

        "text": "Hey all! \n\n2 of my pets died this week\n\nMy 17 year old cat Majsan who I've known ever since I had an actual conscience (I'm 21) on Monday and my sister's cat Cina on Wednesday, who, for a big dog made it to pretty much as long as those guys tend to live (about 12). This was obviously devastating news when I heard about it, but not awfully tragic since they lived to where you would expect them to. \n\nThis week has been the greatest week of my life\n\nThe fact is that the passing away of my two pets, as much as it hurts, doesn't take away from the fact that, this week, I have finally found all of the following:\n\nMeaning, Independence, Purpose, True Joy, The ability to admit my feelings, The ability to accept that I have natural urges like the urge to masturbate and the urge to gorge on food, The realization that there is not a single part of life that HAS to be miserable (work, school, exercising, reading books, playing games, eating food, etc.), The ability to talk to people and think of them as your friends, not your enemies, The ability to feel the thrill of music and dance, The fact that anyone's attempts to get you down (whether their intentions were pure or not) is all down to if you choose it to affect you or not, The fact that what anyone says, whether It's Joe Rogan, Joe Biden, Joe Mama or Joe from Family Guy (those are all Joes haha) should always be perceived as words that may, or may not, be true (nobody is an oracle and we should all have our separate opinions), The painful amount of pressure we put on numbers related to us (height, weight, age, etc.), The ability to feel ART, The fact that we are only on this Earth for a limited time and that if we choose to not have fun while we are on it, we may as well not even exist, and many more.\n\nAnd I have also found out the following:\n\nThe importance of feeling good about your body, The joy of seeing one's muscles in the gym mirror and ADMITTING that that feeling exists and is fantastic, The importance of getting the required amount of macros (carbs, fats, protein, vitamins, minerals, water, etc.), The calming feeling of having one's work done on time, The THRILL of lifting weights and feeling TESTOSTERONE flow through your veins, AS WELL AS THE COSY FEELING OF ESTROGEN FLOWING THROUGH ONE'S VEINS WHILE WATCHING FRIENDS, The joy of taking a SHIT and not holding it in because you \"had to go to a public bathroom\", and many, many more.\n\nThe difference between these two lists for me is this: The first one is the one that we in society look down upon as SOME of it is seen as \"letting yourself go\", whilst the other list is stuff that we (specifically young men) also truly WANT to feel but are almost PREASSURED into feeling them by big burly men, workout videos, or motivational books (except the part about Friends). \n\nFor a lot of people, the first list has a lot of stuff we truly feel on the inside, and in a lot of cases can lead to delayed work, procrastination, missed deadlines, obesity, etc. since these people were unable to keep their foot in reality and admit uncomfortable facts. This was me five years ago when I weighed 166kg (366 lbs.) \n\nToday I weigh 84kg (185 lbs.), but the unavoidable truth is that that number means NOTHING to me now (I really wanted to include photos but this sub doesn't allow it). The fact that I lost half my body weight did not give me genuine pleasure, but I am OBVIOUSLY proud of myself for objectively becoming a more physically healthy person. Remember how I said that 84kg means nothing to me now? Here is another feeling I have: I don't want to become fat again. See? I can feel BOTH at the same time!\n\nThe fact that I weigh about 1kg more than last week (since I am slowly transitioning out of a Keto diet), but I feel 10\\^124 times better (or somewhere in that ball park) means a lot to me. It doesn't mean I EVER intend on going back to my old body but it means I am able to stay both physically AND mentally healthy whilst pursuing my dreams.\n\nThe thing that got the ball rolling was talking to my neighbor R. It wasn't even particularly his advise that made it for me, but the fact that I actually TALKED to someone, was like an initial spark. I asked him this question: \"Why do I not feel any fun in playing videogames anymore?\". His response was basically: \"Not every game is going to work for you, and if you're bored of it, move on\". But the fact that I actually asked the question of \"HOW DO I FUCKING ENJOY VIDEO GAMES\" made me think... is that even normal? Like, as a kid I LOVED videogames, but just the thought of playing any game gave me a feeling of abject misery. Same with movies. Same with shows. Same with books. Same with studying, Same with working. Truly, the only thing I actually felt any sort of longing for was a) the fact that my diet was ending in 3 weeks, and b) getting to watch the next episode of The Last Of Us with that same friend. That's it.\n\nSince I am slowly transitioning out of a Keto diet by eating fruits, drinking milk and other stuff that's \"not totally Keto but almost\" is filling me with stuff my brain needs which could definitely help explain why I feel so good. I also want to add that I have nothing against keto since it helped me a lot. I was also probably missing out on a good number of vitamins and minerals by basically eating the exact same meal every day for 6 months (don't do this). This is also my third time exiting keto in 3 years, but this time feels different. The difference is that I said this: \"I FUCKING LOOOOOOVE TO EAT FOOD!!!\". That goes for almost ALL food, both healthy AND unhealthy. The fact that I have ADMITTED that feeling is like losing 15 times the weight I actually lost on the diet. And since admitting this, I have burned 750 to 1000 calories PER DAY by walking thanks to my new Apple Watch, as well as working out 5 times per week, WHILST also allowing myself to have an apple or a protein bar or some nuts or whatever else my body craves. \n\nOn the outside, people congratulated me on my weight loss and how I looked (which OBVIOUSLY felt good), but on the inside I was lacking something. The same way Ove in \"A Man Called Ove\" felt when his wife Sonja died. In making my love for food a taboo, I was left with a GAPING HOLE. But now that I have admitted this truly doubtless and personal LOVE, I feel like I am finally ready to be who I WANT TO BE. To strive for things that give me GOOSEBUMPS. I am seriously thinking of changing program in university from math to AI since Artificial Intelligence is something that I truly feel something for. Even the word AI makes my hormones go off and my heart fill with excitement. That same feeling that Ove gets when he buys a new Saab or looks into the eyes of his wife. That is the feeling I feel like we should all strive for, since that is what gives us genuine meaning.\n\nThere is SO MUCH MORE I want to say buy I feel like I should end it here so it doesn't get too long. But I'm going to leave you with a Kanye west quote (I know he's not very popular now but his message still holds).\n\n\"We're all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it\"\n\nI hope this helped someone. I know its cliché, but even if just ONE person, regardless of age, sex, race, nationality, etc. has even the next minute of their day improved by this, I will have done a good job. Honestly, even if 0 people get anything out of this, I won't regret it, since this was a good way to spend approximately 90 minutes of my day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSincerely, a man called Jonathan",

        "text": "Two years ago I felt as if I was starting to lose myself and caught myself having way too many depressive episodes. I got into cannabis in which I thought was going to save me and help me find who I really was.\nIt numbed all of my feelings, from true happiness, sadness to anger. The numbness then became my normal way of feeling and I lost total sense of how things were supposed to be felt. It had an impact on my family, job and my precious relationship. I was lucky to notice that this drug was not benefiting me in any way. It took a long time but I believe I've beat my addiction. \n\nI know depression is different for all but for me, all I had to do is change. I started to cook, read a little and workout. In which none of these I went extremely hard at, I just did it. It did take more time out of my day but there was noticeable progress, I went further into it. I started to pay attention to my feelings, got into meditation as a way to calm my nerves. I have just recently understood how my anxiety functions, not all of it but I am not longer living in fear.\n\nI'm finally happy, finally feeling free from everything from the past to thinking in the future and I'm feeling enlightened. I truly believe this is how we're supposed to feel. \n\nThere was some people in my life I had to cut out because of this and I'm happy I did. I understand I will have to forever live with depression but I now understand that I've just got to be open minded and willing to change .\n\nFor those who want to change or are also on this path, positivity is what it took for me, being mindful and realizing that any situation is not the end of the world. Some stupid negative remark from someone shouldn't have any negative impact on me, if it does, I am spending time with the wrong people or I need to filter how I am processing it, let it be used as fuel instead of bringing me down. Now that I'm understanding who I really am, I've got so much any energy to go around.. positive energy... and that kind of thing goes a long way, not just with yourself but others around you.\n\nI felt exhausted everyday coming home from home just from all my emotions, let it get the best of me. Staying on top on top of it all has let my dreams become a lot clearer. On top of my my full-time I want to get into streaming, create a community of like minded individuals and get into creating music one day.\n\nThank you if you read all this way, no matter how many times you heard it before, you'll get through it. We all will.\n\nNote: I know there's a lot more to depression, i just wanted to get out what it took for me to change and hopefully.. maybe it'll help someone. Don't stop loving yourself ❤️",

I have to remind myself that even though they are simple, it’s important I go through with them just to get used to approaching people and getting out of my own head.\n\n**Experience:**\n\nAs usual, in my own head walking around, saw a woman in a mask, approached and said ‘sorry to bother you, my phone just died, do you have the time?’. She seemed a bit caught off guard, found her phone and told me the time. I thanked her and moved on. \n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nNote to self: people in masks probably not the best choice but otherwise, once I'd done it I was happy. It's important that I keep going with this process to ensure that I keep getting better at initiating conversations.\n\nSomething I’ve noticed is that my interactions with people I know has improved massively. The act of speaking to strangers has had a profound impact on my interactions with my family + friends, as I’m just more aware of them, giving them more of my energy and more open to share obscure bits of my day which leads to more laughter.\n\n**If you have any thoughts/ideas for prompts which I could use to slowgress towards confidence with strangers then lmk.**",

        "text": "Hello, I am someone who has issues with depression and anxiety. \n\nHowever, recently since the start of January I made a goal to loose 20lbs since I gained a lot of weight during the pandemic. \n\nI started January strong with building a workout routine- just going there and focusing on a few exercises. It’s only been 1 month but I feel like I am a little gym addicted. I wake up in the morning and look forward to going to the gym to lift weights. Before, I could barely find myself to get up in the morning.\n \nI have also noticed that I walk taller with confidence after I work out. I always felt weak and vulnerable but I don’t feel that way anymore. I have also noticed that I am more picky when I am allowing people to treat me a certain way. I always used to smile and hide my emotions when someone would say something rude to me, now I noticed that I won’t even give them the time of day. \n\nIt is strange because I didn’t think that such a simple thing- exercising regularly would change my life to this extent. I am not even at my goal but I think I developed a habit which is even better than a goal. A goal is just a number but a lifestyle is more long lasting imo. I am not the most fit or muscular person. However, the progress I made is allowing me to feel beautiful just as I am.",

A year spent watching Youtube in my free time would make me an extremely different person than a year spent writing in my free time.\n\nWith it being so important, I’ve tried different ways of dealing with the urge. And for the past year one simple reminder has been a game-changer for me: I’ve never regretted doing good work.\n\nI’ve never prepared for an exam and said, “shit I wish I didn’t study for this.”\n\nI’ve never left the gym after a workout and said, “man what a waste of time.”\n\nMy obsession for the past 5 years has been writing and making cartoons. I’ve never finished a project and regretted spending time on the thing I love the most.\n\nSo any time I’m staring at a blank page, or I’m scared to crack open my textbook I tell myself, “you’ve never regretted this before.”\n\nIt’s always hard to start, but it’s always worth finishing.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI share ideas from great thinkers so we can stand on the shoulders of giants, instead of figuring life out alone",

I recently got an internship offer from a company with great career growth potential.)\n\nHowever, I'm a total fake. I only got the offer because, in the interviews, I exaggerated my story and sold a bigger picture of my achievements and skills than it really is. I only know what I have to do. I haven't done anything. \n\nI seriously lack discipline and I'm afraid at some point my luck will run out. Anytime I'm not in class or part-time job, I'm on youtube or video games. \n\nI'm not spoiled or super privileged or anything, I've worked hard at times to get to where I'm at. I do have the ability to fully invest myself in and work hard to achieve something. It's just that most of the time, I'm super lazy and don't do anything. \n\nI don't think asking for suggestions is going to help either, because I already know what I have to do.

        "text": "Once upon a time, there was a man named Andy. Andy was a self-proclaimed pleasure-seeker and always looked for instant gratification. He was always on the lookout for the quickest and most enjoyable way to get what he wanted.\n\nOne day, Andy's best friend, who was a bit more wise, told him about the concept of \"delaying gratification.\" Andy was puzzled and asked, \"What on earth is that?\"\n\nHis friend explained, \"Delaying gratification is when you resist the urge to take the easy and pleasurable route, in order to achieve a greater reward in the future.\"\n\nAndy couldn't believe it. He thought, \"Why would anyone want to delay their pleasure? That's like saying no to a big, gooey chocolate cake, right now!\"\n\nHowever, his friend convinced him to give it a try and see if it could help him achieve his goals. So, Andy decided to put his pleasure-seeking ways aside and give it a shot.\n\nThe first few days were tough for Andy. He found himself constantly battling his urges, but he persevered. And soon enough, Andy started to see the benefits of his hard work.\n\nHe was saving money, making wise financial decisions, and was even starting to feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. But the best part? He found out that the delayed gratification was actually a big slice of humble pie, and it tasted even sweeter than that gooey chocolate cake he had been craving!\n\nFrom that day on, Andy embraced the concept of delaying gratification and found that not only was it helping him achieve his goals, but it was also a lot of fun to see how far he could push himself.\n\nSo, the moral of the story is, sometimes delaying your pleasure can be even more satisfying than indulging in it right away. And who knows, you may even discover that the humble pie tastes even better than the cake!\n\nGuess who Andy is…\n\n-Drew from Quatro Health Club",

        "text": "Hey guys,\n\nIm 20 years old and I have a question to some more experienced self improvers.  \n\n\nI have been on an long way improving myself out of a deep Depressive state, but right now i feel like I'm Stuck.  \n\n\nBut lets Start with last year.\n\nIts been an amazing year, i Found a new group of friends, and we really have grown together since.   \nIt was the first year I realized that all the effort i put into my brain has had an enormous impact on my mood, and my vibe. \n\nI got longer and longer periods of time, that i was truly happy, longest for about two weeks in a row. I was really going without effort through life. I was engaging more while under people, thinking more clearly, having better humor more often, just gliding through life. Having the discipline to work out and work for my goals every day. Without effort i could do everything with a lot of energy and enthusiasm.\n\nHowever sometimes I just feel like the Brake in Mind kicks in. Its always as i start to feel something for a woman. I already had a very romantic relationship with someone and some experience with other girls. But when I start having serious feelings and intentions towards a girl, it just breaks the flow of my mind. no matte if she is there or not. At work, with friends, at a party, alone... everywhere and anytime i just have a low energy vibe suddenly, leading to less and more exhausting social interaction, bad humor, giving up my discipline, etc.   \n\n\nI Think i just have like a bad mindset towards relationships. Its so frustrating, because I know for sure that my current crush that i know since a couple of years has feelings for me (she said it accidentally when she was really drunk: \"It's such a nice party, I love you - I love IT! - I love IT!!)  \n\n\nHowever I just cant release the brake and keep on flowing and getting closer with her, because im just braked in my mind. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMeditation isn't helping very much. All the improvements over the last year came from intensive Journaling couple of times a week (Whats the Situation/the thought? What feeling is it creating? Is the connection of feeling and thought coming from a past trauma? Why am i not prone to past traumatic experiences nowadays/what is a better way of thinking about the topic/what feeling should be naturally connected to the situation/the thought? etc.?)  \n\n\nBut somehow its not working right now for me, especially with the situation that she cant remember anything from the evening.  \n\n\nWhat are your Mindsets/thoughts when you are experiencing love?  \nWhat are your Tipps on overcoming such a \"brake\" in the head, keeping you away from gliding through life?  \nWhat are your Tools to reframe your thoughts/feelings?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI Really want to get us two on the next level and need to get the break off, because thats the way she knows me :). It's also fucking up my decision making...  \n\n\nThanks in advance and sorry for the bad english.  \n\n\nGreetings",

        "text": "I'm struggling with very bad mood problems for about 8 years now.\n\nSince I tried solving these problems myself, but didn't succeed yet I post here in the hope for help.\n\n# What do I mean with bad mood:\n\n1. **Very tired, Exhausted &amp; Worn out**\n2. **Irritated**\n3. **Unmotivated**\n4. **Inner unrest**\n5. **Unconcentrated**\n6. **Anxious &amp; DPDR** (DPDR is not really a problem for me, it only gets very strong &amp; I have difficulty coping with it when I'm in my bad mood, so I include it)\n\nEvery Afternoon after 1-2pm until I go to sleep, I have the problems mentioned above and I can't seem to solve them myself. These problems have a huge negative impact on my school and work performance, and my general life.\n\nIn these time periods, I can't do anything productive like work, or study, I don't like being in company of other people, I'm on a really short fuse, and just want to be home in my room left alone. That's why things like school and work are very hard to endure for me in the afternoon, and because of that, and my non existing social life I'm pretty depressed.\n\nI can delay my daily negative mindstate for about 1 hour by napping (15-20min), or going for a walk shortly before my situation worsens, but I can't change for the better permanently.\n\nThe last couple of years I felt bad in the morning aswell, but I managed to improve my mornings by doing cardio &amp; relaxing without screens or bright light in the evening, going to bed early &amp; having a fixed circadian rythm.\n\nIn the evenings after doing cardio I feel better (Only tired), but only like 50% of the time.\n\nI'm a 23 yo male, I don't smoke cigarretes or weed and I rarely drink.\n\n# Things I tried to improve my situation\n\n1. Physical\n   1. Several Bloodtests\n   2. Hormone test\n   3. Allergy test\n   4. Lumbar Puncture\n   5. Sleeping with mouthtape\n2. Psychologically\n   1. 4 years of therapy\n   2. Antidepressants &amp; Antipsychotics (Escitalopram \\[SSRI -  Also known as Lexapro or Cipralex\\], Aripripazol \\[Atypical antipsychotic - Also known as Abilify or Aristada\\])\n   3. Mental Hospital for 6 Weeks\n   4. MRI\n3. Nutrition\n   1. Ketogenic diet for 6 weeks (&lt;20g Netcarbs per day)\n   2. Supplements\n      1. Vitamins (All of them)\n      2. Minerals (Sodium, Magnesium, Potassium)\n      3. Omega 3 (DHA &amp; EPA)\n   3. No Sugar and saturated fats for 2 weeks\n   4. Drink enough water (I even drink too much, I'm drinking at least 6 liters per day)\n   5. No Coffee for 6 weeks (I rarely drink coffee anyways)\n   6. No Alcohol for 6 weeks\n   7. Stopped smoking cigarettes\n\nAll of the tests suggested that my health is totally fine, and every therapy, trial or medication mentioned above I tried didn't improve anything for me.\n\n# Theories\n\n* **Bad Sleep**\n   * I could have a sleeping problem, that I'm not aware of. \n   * My main problem seems to be tiredness &amp; exhaustion, since I can't seem to get rid of those two at all. The other problems like irritability or inner unrest aren't permanent, but I'm pretty much always tired, no matter how much I sleep. \n   * I sleep 8-9hours every day, and I value my sleep so there are rarely days, where I don't get at least 8 hours. If I get less then that, my problems get worse exponentially. \n   * I already have an appointment at a sleeping doctor to check that out. I hope that's my problem, because I'm pretty exhausted looking for a cure, or even finding out what my \"illness\" is.\n* **Bad nutrition**\n   * I could have a problem with something I eat daily, or maybe I'm missing something like vitamins or minerals\n   * Since my problems get worse in the afternoon after I eat, that seems plausible to me, that's why I tried to change my nutrition as you can see in the list above.\n   * I don't know, maybe I should see a specialist for nutrition aswell? \n* **Psychologically**\n   * Pretty much all problems started for me, when I was around 13-14. \n   * In that time I started to smoke weed and drink alcohol, and especially the weed was pretty bad for me mentally. I smoked weed like 10-15 times, and pretty much had a horrible bad trip 75% of the time. I'm 99% sure that's the reason for my DPDR, since I remember that DPDR started around that time. \n   * I'm not sure about the other problems like tiredness, exhaustion, irritability etc. These problems started during that time aswell, so maybe weed and alcohol messed up my mental health.\n   * I got diagnosed with severe depression, but nothing else. I managed to get rid of that, and now I'm left with the problems mentioned above. \n   * I don't really know what I should do in that area, because I'm pretty sure I tried most of the things I can. I'm also pretty negative towards therapy, because therapy worsened my mental health a lot. But maybe I will try it out again, if I don't have anything else that I can try anymore.\n\nThanks for your time, I'm grateful for every help I get!",

        "text": "Day two of the challenge proved to be a day of self-reflection and introspection. While I may have fallen short of my goals for the day (again), I delved deeper into the complexities of my own being. I questioned why I sabotage my own success and why I waste precious time, even though I am well aware of the anxiety it brings. \n\nI realized that I have become comfortable in my misery and that I am more at ease with the anxiety of last-minute work, rather than the stress of striving for timely completion. This introspection showed me that I have become too comfortable with my own shortcomings, be it my physical appearance or my lack of self-care.\n\nHowever, amidst all the self-discovery, I also rediscovered my innate ability to create and shape my own world. I remembered that it is possible to bring about positive change, simply through consistent efforts such as drinking enough water, taking vitamins, and doing daily push-ups. Though the changes may not be immediate, I know that with time, the positive impact will be undeniable. I see this know, yet I have yet to fully process it. \n\nOn day three, I aim to make up for the lost ground and focus more on my personal growth and self-discovery. I want to rediscover my passions and the reasons why I embarked on my career, my field of study, my life's journey in the first place. I refuse to let these two days determine the outcome of the next 98. The journey ahead is long, and I am determined to push through it.",

Disclaimer: I’m seeking therapy and looking for support externally, so just looking for guidance from wiser folks from a career and tactical perspective.\n\nMy dream has always been to be a writer. At the moment, let’s just say I need to work a boring but relatively well paid job in finance where technical and practical skills are rewarded. Being a strong writer and being creative is always helpful in a corporate environment, but let’s just say not in the way I hope I can use those skills in the future.\n\nA certificate here, a training there, and I could get rewarded with pay increases which I would appreciate. I don’t care for finance but given my tenor in the space it could be a place for me to work for another 2-5 years until I can exit for a more creative and hopefully fulfilling career.\n\nSo with that said, how do I care about a job that isn’t wrapped around my identity or fully encompasses my interests? I’m not greed motivated, I want just enough to have financial wiggle room, so the carrot on the stick isn’t working for me. \n\nHowever, I’m scared my performance is worsening for lack of interest and in a sense I want to force this round shape into a square peg for just a while longer … so how can I learn to do that?\n\nHappy to give more details on comments.

        "text": "Sorry, I usually dont really love asking for advices, but this time I'm gonna do it anyways since I really could use some. \n\nA few months back, I had a crush on a girl of my college. Took my courage in my hands, and went to talk to her. I couldn't believe it, but everything was going smoothly : We got along really well, she found me funny, intelligent, asked me a lot of questions about myself, laugh at everything I said, would sit next to me to classes... She even straight up told me she would rate me a 7 or 8. She gave me the impression of being a really kind, open-minded and positive person.\n\nThen we got separated for a month because of the exams. And when we met each other again, things were different : At first I was a little bit nervous since we didn't see each other for a long time, so I would come as more distant. It seemingly made her a little bit uncomfortable and someone told me she thought she did something wrong/thought she was akward. So she started to avoid eye contact, and also to avoid me.\n\nI understood that she wasn't interested anymore and even though I still had feelings, I decided to start treating her as a friend.\n\nThing is, since I'm a pretty engaging and open person, she seems to thing I still want to flirt when it's clearly not the case anymore. So when we talked to each other again, but it just wasn't the same. She would always ask questions about myself and stuff, but she laughs far less often ( even less than with other people ), avoid eye contact and even If I dont think she hate me I would say she tolerates me at most. For exemple when I told her Yesterday that I enjoyed talking to her again, she would laugh in an almost mockingly manner and tell me \" Thank you \" with disblief and without even looking at me.\n\nIn short, that's an uncomfortable situation and I really want to get out of it. The thing is, we'll have to see each other pretty often anyways and we're friends with the same people , so we need to resolve this situation.\n\nPart of me want to straight up ghost her from now on. But there's another more prideful part of me that really didn't like the unecessary mean and cold manner she treated me and feel the need to talk to her about this, and also to make all of this situation clear once and for all. But I know she's going to avoid me if I ask her to talk in private, since firstly she hates confrontation, and secondly she'll think I want to confess or something.\n\nAnd even If I hate saying this, even if I feel really pathetic admitting it... There's always a big part of me that loves her and I suffer a lot from this situation. I really don't expect anything anymore, and I'll respect her decision anyways, but she didn't have to treat me like she did, that's harsh for no reason at all. And honestly even if I know I got to move on, and trust me, I try to do so, I just can't forget her old attitude and the good times we had together. It's really painful\n\nWhat should I do in your opinion ? This really isn't a fun situation to live",

It's like a loop in my mind, I want to workout but I believe im introverted and I say I'm introverted because I believe im not confident but I can't be confident if I don't look good and I want to work out then the loop starts again. Is there anyway to fix this? And sorry for the long read I just need to explain",

        "text": "Sometimes, the best thing you can do is to take a step back. You don't have to keep trying to push yourself forward if it isn't working out. Take some time, and explore your emotions, thoughts, and the \"dark side of yourself\" that is hindering your progress. Get to the roots of your problems and start understanding yourself, instead of running away from or trying to fight against yourself. Try to resolve and reconcile with yourself. Once you have that figured out, start figuring out how to let go of these things that are holding you back. Because you will run a lot faster when you're not lugging a boulder on your back.\n\nAbout 6 months ago I was stuck in a hole with a ton of stress about everything. I had been overworking myself for about a year, having not had a break, and using school holidays to work even more intensively towards my goals. I had a build-up of exams and assignments that I was completely unprepared for, an important violin exam, as well as 9 different academic competitions I needed to prepare for, and an intensive science olympiad training program that set around 10 hours of work per week, as well as feeling like I had made no progress for about 2 years. To add to that, the family situation was getting a lot worse and my parents were on the edge of divorce, with me, being an only child, being heavily caught up in it.\n\nAt that point, my mind was so burnt out and full of negative thoughts that it became almost impossible to focus on anything I was trying to do. I couldn't sleep at night, and I couldn't get that negative voice out of my head during the day. I felt overwhelmed, that I was a failure and had wasted my potential, and that everything was falling apart.\n\nThat was when I realised that however much I wished I could push myself through this, I simply couldn't and that I needed to take a step back and sort myself out. I took days off school, not so I had more time to prepare or study, but so that I had time to myself to figure things out. I locked myself in my room and, instead of trying to suppress and block out those negative thoughts and emotions, actively sought them out, and every time I felt something clear enough to be put into words, I spent an hour or more looking it up and reading psychology and mental health articles about it.\n\nAnd what I discovered is that those intrusive thoughts were like scattered pieces of a jigsaw, and the more I read and tried to understand them, the more I could start piecing together the puzzle. And through this, the more I started trying to piece together the puzzle, the more pieces I found; emotions, fears and insecurities buried so deep that I had never even been aware of their existence. The more I dug, the more I found; emotional wounds buried deep down for years, some originating from a childhood I had never even realised was troubling. It was hard, and often hurt, but bit by bit, I was able to piece together my life and come to reconcile with myself. Slowly uncovering the roots of my problems, I realised that it was never possible just to try and swat away my problems like flies.\n\nEven though this may have hindered a bit of progress towards my goals, leading to less-than-ideal results in my pursuits, I do not regret this one bit, and I consider it one of the most important decisions I've made. Because by understanding myself and everything that has caused me struggle, I have made an important first step in dealing with these problems and moving forward in life.\n\nSometimes it is important to take a step back in life so that you can take a dozen more forwards. I'm turning 16 in a couple months, and I'm still trying to figure out how to let go of the things holding me back, develop good and important habits, and explore and figure out the best path for myself.  I don't expect it to be easy, but I know I still have time on my side.\n\nFor anyone out there having similar problems and are trying to discover yourself, good luck! Also thank you if you read all the way through this.",

There was one girl a few months ago who I was close to dating but it fell apart due to me not making a move and then when she got upset about it I let her leave and didn’t fighting for her to stay. After that I fell back into a deep depression and everyday I think about how I screwed things up and I wish I could take it back but she’s long gone. I can’t sleep well, my diet is subpar, and I’m addicted to porn. I deeply want to fix these things but I am always to depressed and tired and I’m scared of the unknown and feel like I’m only doing things to try and get a gf. I’m so alone I wish I just had someone to hold at night and know everything will be okay. Also my hair is receding and I’m quite insecure about my height(5’8”). Im currently unemployed and I feel like my misery is bring down everyone around me. I guess I’m scared to put in the effort because I’m tired but I also don’t know if changing all of my habits and work-outing will get me where I want in life. I get no match’s online dating and I don’t really think I even like myself enough to date someone without just ruining it all. All I think about is her and I just really want a girlfriend.",

I have learned some tools to help me control my emotions better and I have taken notes, done my worksheets, and practiced implementing the exercises daily. \n\nI was in a really toxic relationship with a porn addict who enabled me to depend on him and isolate myself and I left him and have been feeling a lot more confident in myself. \n\nFor a long time, I was scared to help my little sister who is going through a lot of unfortunate medical complications. My mom was hostile to me (due to her PTSD) when I tried to help before and it scared me to the point where I would avoid the situation altogether. But, I have been improving my relationship with my mom and learning more about my sister's care to help out my family. Also, I have been helping with the more bureaucratic side of her care plan like helping choosing doctors and going through paperwork. My mom is slowly starting to trust me more and more with helping them. \n\nI have always wanted to play guitar. I grew up singing for bands and writing songs with simple guitar parts, but I never got past a very beginner level. For over ten years I stagnated at the instrument because I was comfortable singing, and my friends were all better than me, and I didn't know how to go about getting better... but I have finally said eff it and I have challenged myself lately to spend time every day playing and I have already seen so much improvement. \n\nI was an alcoholic. I didn't drink every day and could sometimes go weeks without, but I would say I was an alcoholic because I used alcohol to cope with all sorts of things, and would do it even when I didn't want to or knew it would hurt myself or others. I have started steps to sobriety and have made it just shy of a month sober now. \n\nI am learning to accept more of myself every day, and I am making better decisions. I feel a lot better and I am excited to see my progress with my mental health and guitar skills in the years to come!",
