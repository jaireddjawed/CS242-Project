        "text": "For those trying to follow the story I seem to be missing an episode. The session prior ends with us stealing a ship and finding a tracking device on it. Having a propensity to collect body parts, Null has a Rodian arm spare. So they've put the tracking device in the hand, folded it into a single digit gesture of disrespect and popped it out the airlock.\n\n---\n\nWatching the Rodian's arm floating out the rear view, tracking device flashing, I checked radio chatter and hit up the astrogation computer. Spotted nothing unusual and decided I'd best use the autopilot once I had set the course - the Soldier's decided that right now's a good time to discuss how much better his axe is compared to my rifle. Sometimes I'm genuinely concerned for his cognitive skills. Brute force comes in handy - but only if things can get close. I'm happy being deadly at extreme range. If melee was good I'd mount a plasma cutter on my arm. Somehow his inane muttering goes on for the whole trip. Thankfully we drop out of hyperspace right onto our target. Knew we would.. I set the coordinates. We descended to the ground and commed traffic control while the Seeker, Soldier, Newbro and Hackysack start getting ready to go planetside. The radio barks instructions - dock at bay 65Y. It's up the back, meh - and we receive comms our ship's going to be inspected on landing. Good thing that \"we don't have any contraband\". Not now that we've hidden the gas for the Hutt. The boarding party doesn't spot anything untoward; maybe they're looking for something else. Who knows what they're up to - we're clear, that's the important thing. We disembark.\n\nHacky tracks down a decent contact, turns out to be one of those Rodians - weird little green bastards. We head out to meet up. I watch the people.. heat sigs everywhere. Hacky has a chat with the Rodian who doesn't seem that impressed. The soldier decides that some negotiation is in order and picks the Rodian up and shakes him around - sometimes hitting the wall, occasionally scrubbing him on the ceiling. Oddly this has the desired effect. It shows us where our transport is, and even suggests it may have work for us later. Like I said, weird creatures. Next time I guess we just shake it rather than talk.. maybe it's cultural. If I was a C3 I'd know but that's a huge price to pay.\n\nWe walk out to get to the speeder, fairly sure we're being followed, several sigs have changed direction along with us. At the first junction we split up and hide, shortly after, a Twi'lek comes towards where the seeker and I am. Two humanoids head in the other direction. The seeker commences negotiations with a carbine round clipping the Twi'lek neatly. A round hits the seeker and the soldier looks to be hit too. One of the humanoids pulls out a grenade and pulls the pin as I aim and fire down the alley. A howl of pain, a couple of thuds and there's an arm and a grenade on the ground in between a rather upset human and our soldier who is stepping back. Fortunately it's just a stun grenade rather than a frag. Our new guy seems a bit surprised and doesn't do anything as a few more shots are fired. Another grenade appears but this one's dropped. The soldier dives in and finishes one of the humans off, and my shot disarms our last assailant. We subdue them and demand answers. Turns out they're pretty ineffective bounty hunters tracking us on behalf of the imperials. The bounty hunter part of that story was pretty entertaining. I kick him just because I hadn't had chance to shoot him yet. Apparently we're Force users. Psh. I'm a droid. Who needs that?\n\nI spot some heat sigs closing carefully on us in the alley and we split. Although some neat mind control helped the soldier and I, I tripped and was shot. Mild stun. System stability's low enough another stun willǊƦŌЩḋ\n\n    LE-V0 Unit 245.2.4.2.1.2.2.\n    Initialising..\n    * WARNING.

After a mere 73,206 seconds my door opens and Hacky sticks his head around the corner and throws me my weapon. We try and escape through the maintenance ducts but they're not built for me so we just walk out, encountering nobody. It would've been more fun if I'd been able to shoot something.\n\nWe hop in the speeder and head out into the desert. There's some new armour on the guys to suit the dry conditions. The scanner shows a large vehicle off in the distance - seemingly a land crawler. Jawa merchants usually have good gear so we stop in. Though we couldn't get a diplomacy droid (this doesn't upset me, C3s are the sand in my servos) we did manage a repair droid and some personal deflector shields. We stow our goodies, a good chunk of credits later, and head off again.\n\nWe spot a Rancor and decide we could use the teeth as souvenirs.

        "text": "Hi, so this is kind of an offshoot of a series I normally do over at /r/dndgreentext; however, given the differences in formatting, I figured it’d be better suited for /r/gametales. The main series and relevant worldbuilding stuff can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hawkinggreentext/comments/81bol7/hungry_are_the_dead_repository/), if anybody’s interested.\n\n\n-----\n\n\nResting in a corner of an inn, a slightly paranoid mage took some time to reflect on his latest near death experience.\n\n\n*Well, she wasn’t wrong. What good’s a tiny note going to do for them? What if it gets lost? I’ve got plenty of supplies to write with. I could write more. If nothing else, at least he- or she- will have an idea of who I was, and who they can trust.*\n\n\nRummaging through his possessions, he found a pen, ink, and some parchment, and got to work.\n\n\n----\n\n\n###Foreward:\n\nTo my son/daughter,\nIf you're reading this, I'm probably dead. Should that be the case, I can't express how much sorry I am for leaving you and your mother to fend for yourselves. Now, I’m writing you these letters for three reasons: to give you an idea of who your father ~~was is was~~ is,~~and~~ to tell the story of ~~your mothe~~ myself and the men and women I served with, and to ~~offer~~ give you some ~~advi~~ guidance. ~~If all goes well (or if my siblings tell yo Hopefully you’ll learn from my mista As a head’s up, you mught learn some unsavo~~ On a final note, I want you and your mother to know that I love you both, and that I would have sacrificed anything to be with you.\n\nYour father,\n\nDavid Dinsdale\n\n\n*Where would I even begin? I suppose going right from the beginning could work, lets him know where his roots are.*\n\n\n###On your Family: \n\nI suppose I should start by telling you about some of your family. On my side, you have three uncles and a single aunt, most of whom live in Lancaster- their names are Jon, Mary, Henry, and Kenneth. We were all born and raised by our mother in the Legion Town of Greyguard, where she ~~worked as a pro~~ *he doesn’t need to know that* met my father. Unfortunately, for varying reasons, I wouldn’t be able to tell you anything about your grandfather- I never had a chance to meet him. The only thing that I can say for certain is that he was probably a legionnaire, and that he bore descent from dragons (should innate magic powers ever manifest in you, it either came from him or from your mother, who is also descended from a dragon). I suppose there isn’t much to say about our childhood, aside from me learning how to cast some basic spells. Either way, your aunt now lives in Faeriedown, Jon and Henry remained in Greyguard, and Kenneth set out to explore the continent. If you and your mother ever need anything, you can turn to your aunt. Meanwhile, on your mother's’ side, you have your uncle and your grandfather- your uncle is still on good terms with your mother, so I suppose you could turn to him as well, assuming she’s fine with it. It might be a bit more “complicated” if you meet with your mother’s father, so I wouldn’t exactly recommend doing so.\n\n\n###The Legion:\n\nI stayed in Greyguard for quite some time, doing various oddjobs to get by, along with developing my ability to cast spells. Owing to certain decisions made by your grandmother, I found myself forced to join the Legion in the Journey of 1443 EK. After undergoing some basic training, I was assigned to the 30th Legion, relegated to working in the kitchens (I continued to practice my arcane powers, but it didn’t amount to much). However, a little under a year and a half into my service, a small incident occured while I was casting a spell. While nobody was hurt, the whole affair embarrassed my superior officer- he couldn’t exactly just kill me, but he did have another option. As such, I was transferred to the Nineteenth Special Legion.\n\n\n*What a spiteful bastard.*\n\n\n###A Permanent Assignment:\n\nI was shipped off to Dragonscale in the Tempora of 1445, where I met my new commanding officer and two other Legionnaires that had also been transferred: the Captain was a human by the name of Khan, and the other recruits were an Orc by the name of Zemek and Dent, a monstrous looking figure with multiple arms. As it turns, our new assignment was to fight undead in The Wastes; owing to the need to maintain secrecy, any legionnaire in the unit was to serve for life. After a brief bit of basic training at the local arena, we journeyed to the unit’s main base: Fort Deathwatch. There, the three of us were introduced to the rest of our squad: an Aasimar Paladin of Lyrica named Augustus, and a horribly obese ninja that went by “Bler”. From there, it was just a matter of putting us through some “advanced training” (in which I almost died to a ghoul) and assigning us new ranks; before we knew it, we were part of SL-19, the Corporeal Undead Neutralization Task Force.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/8alqnd/mutants_and_masterminds_3e_bravo_academy_part_5/",
        "text": "This is the story of currently three students attending a highschool in Neo Toronto called Bravo Academy, a specially designed facility to help superpowered Novahuman teens control their powers as well as get a good education.\n\n[Previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/895jdp/mutants_and_masterminds_3e_bravo_academy_part_4/), students Alistair, Kayla and Sean were relaxting after their encounter with Grav Master before being pulled into the danger room with the staff to receive the Dad Talk from Agent Halo. The group were offered new golden key cards so they could join the teachers during their training sessions so the group would be better prepared against villains in the future, just so they were sure. After some training, the group return to their regular activities, Alistair continuing to pester his classmates about their thus-far unseen powers before they went to classes and joined some clubs.\n\nPlayers were awarded one Power Point for their efforts, and at the start of the fourth session, their Hero Points reset to 1 each.\n\n*Thus, we move onto our next adventure:*\n\nPlay begins at the start of a practical exercise on a Wednesday morning. The class, being run by feral hero Wildman, was an investigation exercise in the Abandoned Warehouses District. The group would be given a map to a location and told to investigate a crime scene, put together a case and come back with what they learned. The map led to a spot on the water front, and getting their in their own ways, the trio arrive at a remarkably grisly scene.\n\nThree mannequins, all dressed in suits and ‘hideously burned’ lay strewn across the landscape. It was clear that they were long ‘dead’ and checking them over, also clear they were criminals of some description.\n\nAfter some investigation, the group find a laptop hidden in a grate containing arms sales data, and Kayla used her powers to have a look onto the recorded security footage, showing a 3D animation of four goons being approached by a fire themed hero or villain, who burned all four to death before leaving, and then a different costumed individual turn up, assess the scene then walk away with the loot. It became somewhat unsettling, of course when the group realised that there were three fake bodies, but four known fake victims. Where’d the last guy go?\n\nThe answer came soon enough, as the sounds of splashing and low growls from below the edge of the dock became apparent to the group; Sean slowly heads over to investigate, and as he does, there’s an explosion of water as a mangled, humanoid form shoots into the air and towards the group. Sean attempts to catch it, finding the mannequin being too heavy to carry himself and Alistair comes over to help him. The dummy held the same burn marks as the other three, but also gained some massive, horrifying bite marks. Chunks of the thing were missing, and that in and of itself was unsettling. As the group deliberated over what to do, they saw a big, grey webbed hand reach up and grab the edge of the dock. The group decided to hide as best they could, and watch as a twelve-foot tall shark man, adorned in leather jacket, black cargo pants and motorcycle boots for his size pulls himself up onto the land (think Lobo if he was a shark person). He appears to be talking on the phone, which is a diminutive device compared to his massive frame.\n\nAs he talks to someone, the group pick up that he’s talking about the risks and logistics of attacking the Academy. However, he stops all of a sudden as he sniffs out something, catching on that there are a couple of people here. It’s difficult, but Kayla uses her google-fu to pick up that this is Max Predator, an ‘Iron Age’ villain (so, his heyday was late 80s/early 90s). Kayla covertly informs the group of this, and Sean exits his hiding spot to buy time while Kayla gets in touch with Wildman. Max seemed pleased when Sean ‘recognises’ him to a degree, and when Kayla gives the good word, Alistair hops out of his hiding spot to try and distract Max with a near point-blank Air Cannon.\n\nSadly, Max is a brick of a creature, being the tankiest foe the group had faced thus far, even more so than Grav Master. The attack hits easily enough, but the sheer BEEF of the shark man lets him weather the blast with little trouble. As initiative is rolled, Sean uses his speed advantage to grab both Kayla and Alistair and leave the environment, running at least half a mile, stopping only briefly to explain the situation further to Wildman, who barrels past them to deal with the threat. As the group get to safety and see the shadow of a rook jet in the distance, Kayla pulls up an image feed from a nearby security camera to watch the fight between Wildman and Max Predator.\n\nWhile both people were of relatively same power level, mechanically they were quite different. Mainly, Wildman was built more around versatility, tracking and agility, while Max was min-maxed by comparison into being tough and strong and not much else. Wildman is able to dance around Max’s main attacks and deafen him with loud, unrelenting howls allowing him to land some claw and bite attacks, but they didn’t do much against the freakin’ shark man, who would regenerate from any damage he failed to save against. The fight lasted for approximately a minute and a half, but was ended swiftly when Max spun around to catch Wildman with a strong, swinging forearm and got lucky, nailing the feral hero and sending him hurtling into a nearby wall, visibly cracking the concrete.\n\nWith Wildman out, Max casually turned to leave back in the water. Sean, thinking quickly, dashed back over and slyly stole the shark’s cell phone before leaving again, with Max thankfully realising that pursuit wasn’t a great option and diving back into the water. As he does, Sean returns to the scene to tend to Wildman just as Halo arrived in the Rook Jet and Golden Conquerer flies herself over and picks up the injured hero.\n\nHalo talks to the group, asking for details and Kayla helps further by hacking Max’s phone, finding that he was in contact with ‘ACES’, but can’t seem to get anything else. After finding that the comm chatter doesn’t mention a villain of any kind, Halo agrees to keep this under wraps from the remaining students, and takes over the class. The group are asked what they discovered in their investigation and how they would proceed, and the three deduce that it was an arms deal gone wrong, with a suspect with fire powers arriving on the scene, killing the four goons and leaving before another suspect arrived in a vehicle of some kind and drove off with the loot. A plan is made to tail the guy in the car as well as hunt for any hero or villain with fire powers in the area. Satisfied, Halo says they pass and the trio wait for the remaining students to return with their investigations.\n\nOther students come back and each gives their summation of a variety of different crime scenes, with most of students passing with flying colours, with the exception of Gar who wasn’t really the investigative type and had left Freddy to do all the work, and Rachel who didn’t really bother. The group return to the rook, and they go to speak with their other friends. Sean sits with Cara and José, where he asks if Cara found any teacher could help with the first responders, before Cara invites Sean to go with them into the city over the weekend. Jonathan sits with Kayla for a bit and they have a brief chat, and Alistair sits at the back-o’-da-jet.\n\nThe group return to the school and resume their lessons. As the day winds down, Alistair and Kayla go to attend the Video Game club while Sean heads into the city and gets a part-time job as a delivery boy for Mama June’s. After taking care of the pizza ordered for the video game club, Sean earns his $10 tip from the one delivery, and the pizzeria’s manager gives Sean the job, for three hours every Wednesday, Thursday and Friday (through this, Sean games the complication Responsibility: Job at Mama Junes). Kayla is allowed to stay at the club despite her technopathy, with Andrew Svenson explaining that she could use her abilities to cheat the AI and help the club train for tournaments.\n\nThe group reconvene in their dorm, and Sean invites Kayla and Alistair to join him, Cara and José for their excursion to the city on the weekend, but Alistair declines rather adamantly. Sean is less than impressed with his dormmate’s desire to not be social, but does eventually let it be.\n\nThat night, while sleeping, Alistair awakens to the sound of glass being tapped coming from the main room. Investigating, he goes into the main room and turns the lights on. As nothing seems the change, Alistair goes over to the window and opens the curtains.\n\nThe view from the window is obscured by the gargantuan frame of Max Predator, fist pulled back for a punch, rows of sharp teeth gleaming with a mad smile as he screams **“recognise me NOW!?”**\n\nThe punch obliterates the window, and much of the wall waking up the other two as well as a good number of the students in the neighbouring rooms. Alistair is pushed back into the room, and as the dust settles, it’s apparent that this isn’t a dream as the shark man still looms on the side of the building. Kayla attempts to set the alarms off, which haven’t been triggered yet, only to find they’ve been turned off at the power. When attempting to radio out to every available teacher, the responses are laggy and filled with static, but she does get through to someone.\n\nSean grabs Kayla, and Alistair refuses to budge. Bringing the technopath to the stairwell, Sean runs back to run distraction and help keep the stubborn Brit alive. Alistair opens up with an Air Launcher to try and push Max out of the building, but Max’s bulk allows the shark man to keep clinging onto the building defiantly. Kayla, meanwhile, decides to settle things the hard way and rides the power lines down to find the control console for the emergency systems. In her journey, she finds and reactivates the main emergency console, activating the level 1 defences. She then moves on to find the thing jamming the communications, a small device the size of a walkie-talkie pinned to a wall, which she turns off, allowing her to get in full contact with the staff.\n\nMeanwhile, Max clambers into the room, having to slouch because of his size and reaches out to strike at Alistair, though his accuracy is terrible and he misses. Alistair and Sean continus to try and beat back the shark man back, unable to get passed his high toughness. It’s at this point that backup arrives in the form of Rachel.\n\nRachel finally demonstrates her power, which is a fairly terrifying thing. She speaks this one word, a word that’s unintelligible, but somehow sounds wrong. As it’s spoken, a fell energy falls over Sean, Alistair and Max. Mechanically speaking? The Power Word of Ruin triggers three effects at once: a straight damage, a repelling force that knocks people back and a weaken effect that reduces toughness temporarily.\n\nSean manages to save against everything and observes as physics is distorted and the air seemingly gains teeth. Max tanks the brunt of it but is able to withstand most of it while Alistair takes the worst of it and is flung out of the new hole in the wall, far more gaunt than before. He manages to summon up enough willpower to cushion his fall with a blast of air as he lands on the nearby beach, and attempts to retaliate with an air-snipe. It’s at this point that Kayla’s actions kick in and a pair of large turret lasers activates from concealed spots and joins the assault on Max. As Sean lands a running knee strike, four Dudebots fly up to grab Max by each limb, pulling him out into the air to receive a devastating chokeslam from Golden Conqueror.\n\nWith the villain subdued, Kayla brings the device she found to halo, who is quite disturbed by the fact that a villain has attacked the school, and it was a potentially co-ordinated attack. As he quietly deliberates, Rachel goes down stairs and meets with Kayla.\n\n“You know I heard rumours...” she begins, “about other students who ran into supervillains before.”\n\n“Is that so?” Kayla asks, timidly. There’s a pause.\n\n“And here I thought my time here would be boring,” a smile graces Rachel’s lips as she says this.\n\n“Who would think being in a school for super powers would be boring?” Kayla’s question is met with a light chuckle.\n\n“Heh, well, when you can do what I do, sometimes it might be,” Rachel says, before patting Kayla on the back, “I’m thinking we’ll be seeing more of each other.”\n\n[We’ll just have to wait and see what happens next.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/8hfrwp/mutants_and_masterminds_3e_bravo_academy_its_a/)",

        "text": "NULL : Re-armed and More Dangerous\n\nOnboard the ship, StraySis, MechGuy, CoPilot and Wookiee talk among themselves about the upcoming day. The Soldier and Newbro have gone venturing to find more information in the syndicate's facilities, dunno what they expect to find out really. We already know we have to kill things, that should suffice. I wipe at some imaginary fluff stuck to my light repeating blaster. From comm chatter and a few contacts, we find there's a crisis meeting of the companies running the youth camps in a day, presumably due to our recent efforts. All this planning is silly - we have grenades, therefore we have a way in, even if we don't have our chief negotiator. I humour them anyway and support the idea, and they set about finding us a quieter way in. The Wookiee has the great idea of getting work in security at the facility, since he is known to the owners as a bit of a heavy. I assume it wasn't his idea since it was a decent one. We initially attempt to find a forger but no deal there. Fortunately MechGuy has a contact and arranges for an invite to be sent to us after a bit of verbal negotiation. The infobroker looked somewhat puzzled when I asked about the cat smugglers. We go grab some food and entertainment then head uneventfully back to the ship. The others head to their bunks and as I plug in I archive the day's rather disappointing data. I was kinda hoping I'd need to shoot something.\n--[SLEEP MODE]--\n\nWe report in to the authorities as required and let them know we'll be attending the meeting, and head off. After entering the facility and being escorted into the foyer, the Wookiee ambles up and gives our ticket a cursory glance before letting us in. It's surprising how slowly his fur is growing back, it must be quite itchy which would explain his demeanour. \n\nAlso in the area are 12 Twi'leks and Humans with 7 guards, 8 including the Wookiee. Mechguy tries to track down some more local information without much success, and seemed to arouse some suspicion so he backed off. A few cycles later the Wookiee and 3 other guards return, with the planet's syndicate leader who we've done work for before. As the Wookiee strolls past back to his post he murmurs that the canapés are quite delightfully crisp, and subtly hits his comm to explain his plan to create a diversion .. since Wookiees only really have one volume setting it's a good thing nobody can understand. The mood in the room seems tense as they discuss recent attacks on their compounds, and disruptions to shipping services. Fortunately I can't grin mischievously. During the meeting we find the locations of 3 other camps in the area, which we record discreetly.  The leader is in definite control as he speaks of plans to involve the Empire and get assistance in exchange for services. At the end of the meeting he approaches us and offers further work, with a shipment due to depart in 3 days, he's offering 15Kcr. Not that much really, but it beats doing nothing. Hopefully there's someone to shoot in the interim.\n\nSuddenly there's a call to take cover and some guards head out to the commotion. The Wookiee dives onto the leader and drags him out the door with us following, me near the rear. The CoPilot drops a thermal detonator on the way out and closes the door as we exit. The Wookiee, now with the leader unconscious over his shoulder charges ahead as an explosion shakes the ground. We race to our speeder - I fill the driver's seat and we load everyone in, carefully making sure the leader's unconscious and covered.\n\nAs we approach the landing pads, we're stopped by local forces who we manage to convince we had nothing to do with the chaos at the meeting but did have to leave for a mission shortly. He reminds us to stay out of trouble - us ? \n\nWe return to the ship and hop out. Newbro and the Soldier ask about the carnage as we pull up - then, seeing our cargo, quickly help unload everyone into it. We make sure the leader's bound and in the process we find a tracking device in his earlobe, which we carefully neutralise. I take the pilot's seat and plot in the coordinates for a trip to orbit and hit the comms.\n\nBay 674, Lambda Shuttle requesting takeoff permision for repairs in orbit.\n\nLambda Shuttle, bay 674 please confirm your no departure compliance.\n\n674 confirming - we are just performing in orbit repairs.\n\nOK 674, confirmed for flight to orbit.\n\nThrottle up and off we go. As we pause in orbit I plot indirect coordinates to our actual destination, Bonadine. 3 jumps later we arrive perfectly where we planned, just outside orbit. We detect an Imperial Star Destroyer on the scanners and are rapidly hailed. I immediately I plot another course, this time to Yavin, Again, we drop out of hyperspace on the edge of orbit. I hit comms and contact landing control, requesting a pad, which is granted without incident, We locate the Rebel Command and take our cargo for a ride.  We explain the situation and the information the syndicate leader has about slave traders - the commander immediately offers us work at Mandalor to get involved in some more negotiations. I like this guy. I've never been there and heard they're nice, so sounds like a good trip. Still no progress on the cat smugglers, which is concerning. In repayment our ship's upgraded with more thrust and a new transponder. Upgrades are never a bad thing.\n\nNot much else to do here so we head back to the ship. Request clearance, take off, plot coordinates, Jump. Fairly mundane really. Once we're in the system we do the ritual communication with the system's resident Star Destroyer and get clearance to land on Mandalor. The facilities themselves have a lot of imperial ships docked, indirectly showing their allegiance. \n\nWe disembark and hunt around for equipment shops. Searching around we visit large emporiums and small corner stores looking for new goodies. Over the next few hours we find a number of useful items, most of which was weaponry for the other guys, but my main interest is in my shiny new set of arms, which MechGuy was able to get hold of, and arrange to have fitted. Will need to find some more upgrades, I'm only slightly deadlier.\n\nWhen returning to our ship, a group of five Mandalorians start hurling abuse at the Wookiee. Today's not a day for taunts, so I decide to start negotiating with them instead. Before anyone can react I've unslung my blaster and fired 5 rounds in a sweep, hitting each one of them - auto fire can be quite rewarding. Kinda annoyed they didn't all die even if I did hit them all. The CoPilot fires at one and hits, MechGuy wisely ducks behind some cover, he's not the combat type really. StraySis runs up close with her newest toy and a huge gout of flame engulfs the entire group .. I'd never really considered a flamethrower before. A Mandalorian drops his weapon while drawing it.\n\nThe Wookie charges in and begins punching one, a round flying past him. He throws the Mandalorian to the ground and starts swinging his fists, connecting repeatedly. I think he'll remember not to upset a self conscious Wookiee next time he meets one. The Mandalorians split up, and one of them fires directly at me, but MechGuy deflects it and I'm merely clipped in my arm instead. Would've been nice if my new arms had managed to be unscathed for at least the first hour. More shots fly past, one hitting StraySis hard. I aim and fire a single aimed round scoring another hit. CoPilot fires and hits, and another burst of flame and 2 of the Mandalorians go down. \n\nThe Wookiee continued to pummel his target, knocking him out but keeping going. You have to admire his persistence but I think he holds a grudge really well. I fire and hit again, taking out another. CoPilot and Stray attack again, killing the remaining foe. Thus ends negotiations - their team was evidently unprepared. I grab a repair pack and buff out the scuffs. Stray gets some medical help from MechGuy.\n\nNot much stuff left behind after the fight, really - definitely nothing better than we had, but anyway. Somehow we didn't attract much attention aside from the 5 guys we met. One benefit of using the back roads and alleys I guess. We head back to the landing pads without any further incident and board the ship.\n\nHopefully nobody's noticed we're here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "This is the story of currently three students attending a highschool in Neo Toronto called Bravo Academy, a specially designed facility to help superpowered Novahuman teens control their powers as well as get a good education.\n\n[Previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/84i321/mutants_and_masterminds_3e_bravo_academy_part_3/), students Alistair, Kayla and Sean were hanging out in Neo Toronto on the weekend, grabbing a pizza just as the news came on about the appearance of supervillain Grav Master. While wandering the city, they are made aware of a new issue with a woman’s purse being snatched by mechanical spiders. With the city’s heroes and cops more focussed on Grav Master, the three take to the streets to do some legit hero work, and find the lair of Dr. Irresponsible, a kid scientist villain who was clearly as new to the gig as they were. While dealing with Irresponsible, their exit is interrupted by the appearance of Grav Master, and a massive brawl is underway before the group are assisted by Voltaic Vanguard, the world’s greatest superhero.\n\nPlayers were awarded one Power Point for their efforts, and at the start of the fourth session, their Hero Points reset to 1 each.\n\n*Thus, we move onto our next adventure:*\n\nThe game begins the following day, a lazy Sunday. The players are relaxing in their dorm room with the hopes of a day without too much trouble. Kayla is tending to Lucky, who has now been converted into being a robot dog rather than a spider, Alistair is napping and Sean is indulging in sci-fi classic series M.D. DaFuq. Their relaxation is interrupted when a message comes up on their notice screen saying they need to head to the Danger Room in half an hour. Anticipating what might be coming up, the group get ready and head down, passing by others working out in the gym, including one guy who was dressed like a rocker, and even had a guitar (odd gym apparel, but nothing much else).\n\nWhen reaching the danger room, the receptionist told the group that the staff was in there doing their regular training courses. When they explained why they were there, the receptionist did some checking and let them in, saying that Agent Halo asked them to come along. Inside, the group were witness to a good number of the staff awaiting their turn in the room, Golden Conqueror already inside and delivering a spinning piledriver to a giant robot. As they enter, Dr. Smythe turns around from the control console and welcomes the group, curious as to why they are here, and when being told they were asked to come, he calls over Agent Halo.\n\nHalo looks over and gets up, crossing his arms, and proceeds with ‘the dad talk’.\n\n“So I had an interesting conversation yesterday,” he says, the electronic reverb from his voice cutting through the chaotic background noise like a knife. The trio immediately shrank.\n\n“Is it about the new cafeteria menu?” Sean asked, attempting to lighten the mood.\n\n“Heard it’s good!” Alistair adds, “Bacon Butties in the morning!”\n\n“Yeah, yeah, well... you know, I can’t...” the agent waves his hand to gesture to the metal encasing half his face.\n\n“Oh, yeah, right, um,” the brit blurted out, pausing for a moment as more questions entered his mind, “but, how do you-”\n\n“Questions for later,” Sean interjects.\n\n“But like a plant?”\n\n“Alistair.”\n\n“But-”\n\n“Alistair?”\n\n“But like a plant, though...”\n\n“Questions. For. Later.”\n\nKayla proceeds to hide behind Alistair some more as he continued to dig his own grave. Halo doesn’t make a sound, but the lines of light in his cybernetics glow a little more as if he sighs.\n\nThe three explain their situation, how they didn’t really have much of a choice when being interrupted while actually dealing with something their paygrade, and they couldn’t let someone like Grav Master get away.\n\nHalo goes on to say that, under normal circumstances, sterner words would be had; Iron Bandit was something entirely unforeseen, and even then just ‘very good with a gun’ by the standards of most power scales, while Grav Master was something the group were aware of being a significant factor prior to the attack and manipulates a fundamental force of the universe.\n\n“However,” he states, “it’s hard to admonish you when you have the backing of, what has been declared, the greatest masked vigilante on the planet.”\n\n“A-about that. We didn’t mean to, well...” Alistair interjects, “she just kind of turned up.”\n\n“And it’s a good thing she did,” the agent added. He went on to explain that the school isn’t a long standing organisation, being only as old as Neo Toronto is, and accidents happen, either on or off campus. When a student dies or is grievously wounded, there are a lot of things to be done and a lot of things happen when they do; papers need filling out, questions need answering, audits need performing. Letters are written, phone calls are made, families are contacted, and feelings are hurt. It’s a long, expensive and painful process for all involved, and without trying to guilt trip the three too much, it could be damaging to Bravo Academy as a whole.\n\nIt’s why they have said, repeatedly and plastered anywhere they could that Bravo Academy, while using superhero-style training isn’t a superhero school. It was there just to help the students control their powers. Despite this, the faculty are aware that students will do hero work regardless, and short of tyrannical nullification, they can’t do much about that; they just have to trust that the students wouldn’t bite off more than they could chew.\n\n“I also know from a psychological experience, admonishing you for saving lives and doing hero work will only turn you into villains in the end.”\n\nSmythe wanders over at this point, explaining that it is statistically unlikely that a pair of brand new students, in the first week of their time at the academy dealt with not one, but two Supervillains and it remain entirely coincidental. Previously, students wouldn’t have even seen an active Supervillain until some point in their sophomore year, and even then, it was always from a safe distance with little to worry about, and not to mention the fact that in both instances Kayla and Alistair were the students involved.\n\nSomething was up, but they didn’t know what exactly. It could be a coincidence that the group were the students on the scene all the time, but finding so many villains in such a small amount of time was unnerving. It had been discovered, over the past few years that villains shied away from Neo Toronto, not just because of how high tech it was but because of the island of super-powered teens and their veteran handlers. By the standards of villainy, it was the most foolhardy target anyone could imagine, and anyone less than the likes of Silas Creed were usually smart enough to not see it as a worthwhile place of villainous business.\n\nBecause of this they were assuming the villains and the players were likely linked in some way, and wanted to make sure that, if these kids were the target of some conspiracy, or were ultimately unlucky enough to be hurled into the fray, that they were prepared on a level beyond the standards of the school itself.\n\nAs such, Smythe bequeaths unto the three golden keycards, and Halo explains these cards can be used to enter the Danger Room between the hours of 12 until 2 in the afternoon on Sundays to join the staff with their training exercises and get some pointers.\n\n“Now, I am sure everyone is likely to go easy on you, won’t they Robert?” Smythe asked. Halo’s shoulders sagged.\n\n“Please call me by my code name,” he mumbles.\n\n“Your code name is silly,” the scientist interjects, straightening his posture. Halo wheeled around, brow raised.\n\n“Your entire name is silly,” he argued, throwing an arm back to indicate the rest of the staff gathered, “everyone’s name is silly here, I mean what about him?”\n\n“Dude, what the fuck?” objected the school’s security chief and creator of the Dudebots, the Fratmeister.\n\n“Language,” Sean said, causing the middle aged hero to slump a little in disappointment.\n\nThrilled at the prospect of joining their teachers and peers in full hero training, the group observed some of the regiments that the staff went through, namely hitting targets and fighting giant robots. During this, Alistair tried to unlock the full power that he had, but couldn’t get passed the mental barriers he put in place before hand over his childhood, resulting in a fair bit of frustration.\n\nAfter a session in the danger room, the group head back to their rooms and Kayla takes Lucky for a walk, bumping into Jonathan Estobal along the way. The two have a chat, Jonathan being out in the sunlight disproving, to an extent the theory that he is a vampire.\n\nThe following morning, the group head to homeroom and find that, with a lack of students pestering them, word hasn’t gotten out about the Grav Master situation, but rumours are abuzz about three students being present at the fight with Grav Master and Voltaic Vanguard being sighted on campus. After Halo arrives and takes the usual roll call, he reminds the class there will be a half-day today so that the students can go out onto campus and browse the stalls for signing up to teams and clubs.\n\nDuring a period of time where the students can chat before classes begin, Alistair corners Jonathan and demands to know what he is. With Jonathan taken aback, Sean drags Alistair away before the bridge is well and truly burned. José wanders over to his dorm-mate.\n\n“You have very interesting friends,” the Transylvanian noble mentions.\n\n“Uh... yeah?” is the response.\n\nWith Jonathan managing to go the entirety of Homeroom without telling Alistair what his powers are, the brit decides to focus on Rachel, who is remarkably coy and just whispers “it’s a secret” in his ear. He then asks the girl with the ponytail and glasses from the first day what her powers are and she explains that she can generate force around an object to hurl it at high velocity. Halo, who has not left the room, gets Alistair to calm down before dismissing the group. After classes, the group head to lunch. Alistair goes back to the dorm, while Kayla and Sean go to the cafeteria as Monday is Burrito Day. While they eat, the rocker from earlier turns up, who says he saw the group at the Danger Room. He holds out a hand to shake, introducing himself as Roy Donovan, a sophomore. He asks why they were at the danger room during teacher’s time, and the group keep quiet saying that they were to talk to Halo and nothing more. Roy offers to be their upperclassman guide, and also mentions his Dio tribute band called ‘The World’. He pulls out a flyer and gives it to the group, and says they try and do a show every month and a big concert at Halloween before letting the players eat their lunch.\n\nAfter lunch, the group go out onto campus and view the large gathering of students surrounding the stalls advertising various different clubs and services. Most of them were a variety of different ‘Amateur Patrollers’ groups, basically student Supergroups to go out into Neo Toronto and keep an eye out for crime. It was lucky that the group had avoided a large amount of fame from their encounter with Iron Bandit, else they might have been head hunted by the many multitudes of these students. Instead, the group find a variety of different clubs that appeal to their various interests.\n\nSean finds a First Responders club, run by an energetic girl called Cara Jameson, who sadly hadn’t been able to get enough people interested in the idea and is most happy that Sean had taken an interest. Kayla signs up for a basic self-defence group, the table being run by a rather energy deficient goth kid, as well as joining Alistair in joining the video games society, run by fellow home room student Andrew Svenson. The three of them also joins Andrew’s Danger Room club, dedicated to the design and play of Danger Room scenarios, as well as finding Freddy Mars sitting in on the Base Builders United table. Apparently the school had various unused rooms and corridors which are cleared out at the end of the year, and the BBU are allowed to convert these rooms into their own secret super bases. The description is enough to get the three to sign up immediately.\n\nAs the session ends, Alistair spies Gar seemingly having a verbal standoff with a very well-built young man before storming off.\n\n[We’ll just have to wait and see what happens next.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/8alqnd/mutants_and_masterminds_3e_bravo_academy_part_5/)",

Being curious and after running a few errands like resting and buying stuff, we head there. \n\nFinding out that there is a civil war going on, we try and talk to a passer by to see what they know. Lo and behold! It's a Duegar, who promptly spits on our Dwarf Cleric.\n\nOur cleric, slightly bored from the mundane tasks of the day, spits back into the Duegar's face. \n\nDuegar: You insulted me!

I'm on the opposite side of the fortress now and I have to catch up with my group, alas, I hear the sound of a horde of skaven coming. I look around and, to my horror, see that they are coming in my direction, possibly leaving the party completely safe and me to fight them alone. Not having time to catch up I quickly put myself in a narrow place, deciding I'll fight them like the Spartans did. \n\nI defended myself well, my large weapon kept swinging fast, taking them down in groups and I barely got hit. I was a little worried because, while I picked the spot because healing supplies were close, there also was a jar of flammable oil, but I managed to stay away from it well enough.\n\nAs the horde of skaven was thinning down and only five of them were left, running to me, I thought it was over, I could finally heal up and catch up with my group.\n\nAt that point the others probably thought I really needed help, I hear the voice of the pyromancer loud and clear \"Flames, walk with me!\" \n\nI don't know exactly how it happened, I mean, I have a very good guess, but it happened so quickly I couldn't see it. I only know the jar of oil blew up, taking away a massive amount of my health. The few skavens still alive died, I tried to walk out of the flames, but I ended up burning alive, that's when I actually had to get help getting back up and heal. After a massive wave of ratmen, it was one of my team mates causing my death. Thanks, Sienna.",

        "text": "I was taking a much-needed break after working on a bathroom remodel since early in the morning. Finding my wife left her Xbox on, I stopped to see what game she had been playing. Seeing the title screen for Sea of Thieves, I grabbed the controller and hopped on. I had missed all beta sessions and was anxious to see what all the fuss was about. The character was my wife's and did not properly reflect a character I would play myself, so I opted to change my name in spirit to First Mate Togepi.\n\nHaving no idea how to play I opted to do a solo ship, not wanting to disappoint any teammates until Togepi got his bearings. He appeared on the starting island and ran all over trying to figure out what he was supposed to do. Eventually Togepi found his ship and headed out to sea.\n\nFirst Mate Togepi had no quests or goals other than not hitting any islands or rocks per my wife’s suggestion. Togepi was able to get his mighty sloop under control, with only occasionally looking straight up or down due to being unused to a controller rather than a keyboard and mouse. Things were *smooth sailing*.\n\n Before long, Togepi spotted another ship anchored near a small island. As Togepi aligned his ship and manned the canon, a faint sound could be heard. Unsure if the just the game or a voice from another pirate, he held back from firing to listen. A moment later, he could hear that fabled prepubescent voice screaming.\n\n \n\n&gt; JEREMY! THERE’S A SHIP COMING!\n\n \n\n**BOOM!** Togepi fired his first shot, nailing the enemy vessel.\n\n \n\n&gt; JEREMY ITS SHOOTING AT US GO GO GO!!!\n\n \n\n**BOOM!!!** Another solid hit!\n\n \n\nThe other ship began to pull away from the island. It was a galleon and had far superior firepower, however Togepi had started the engagement temporarily giving him an advantage.\n\nSeveral more shots were exchanged. Seeing the galleon look like it was taking on water, and only receiving one shot himself, Togepi was feeling cocky and mocked them.\n\n \n\n&gt; This be First Mate Togepi. Prepare T’meet the bottom of the deep blue!\n\n&gt; If you're alone, wouldn't you be captain?\n\n \n\nTogepi paused for a moment, contemplating his self-value. Finding it easier to not dwell on, he quickly dismissed the thought and fired his canon again.\n\n \n\n**BOOM!** This time from the impact one of the enemy crew flew off the deck, splashing into the water.\n\n\n\n&gt; JEREMY NO!!!\n\n \n\nSuddenly the enemy galleon turned, leaving Togepi unable to hit the target. He abandoned the cannon and scrambled to get up to the wheel, but the ocean had turned red like blood. The waves became massive and he lost sight of the galleon. He tried to turn back to where he had come from, but the sails had almost no wind to them, and the ship began to slowly sink. Feeling he had earned the right, he had a short ceremony pronouncing himself the captain of the vessel. Captain Togepi went down with the ship, down into the dark abyss.\n\nThen I was told I had wasted enough time and went back to tiling the bathroom, while recounting the tales of the mighty Togepi to my wife!\n\n",

        "text": "&gt; The party surveys the wreckage of the farmhouse, and introduces themselves properly to the patriarch of the family, and ruthless kobold-slayer, Couth. He is clearly worried for his family, but ready to fight to protect them.  He is a big fellow, heavily muscled but moves with a silent grace.  Heavy scars peek from the edges of his simple tunic.\n\nAfter some rumination and fiddling, the DM decided that the guy he mentioned as a barbarian in the last session was actually a monk - more interesting fighting style for us, in his estimation.\n\n&gt; Rickart and Alice wander to the smoldering farmhouse to investigate the crossbow trap, while the family gathers their meager possessions and Nez idly scrawls doodles on the ground.  The smoke offers some difficulty, as the trap is bolted to a table.  Alice cuts through that Gordian knot, though - she simply drags the table, trap and all, out to the yard.\n\nWe knew we wanted this heavy crossbow but it turned out to be harder to get than we thought.\n\n&gt; Rickart, after some tinkering, is able to disengage the heavy weapon from its mounting, and Alice retrieves some bolts from a sack hanging from a wall inside the house.  Alice slings her new toy across her shoulders as the family takes up what little arms are available.  After some planning and deliberation, the party - now four members stronger - agree to make their way to the keep, for safety... and information.\n\nSo we started travelling with our NPCs and it involved some tense maneuvering through the wreckage of Greenest to arrive, under cover at the keep.\n\n&gt; The party arrives at the keep, maintaining stealth, at the unfortunate moment of an ambush.  The guards of the keep, facing a line of hostile kobolds, are set upon at their flanks by three beasts - ambush drakes.\n\n&gt; It is agreed that the party can offer the most assistance using surprise, so Nez whispers his dissonant words to a kobold, who clutches his head and falls to the ground. Alice loads her crossbow and lets fly at a drake, but the shot glances across its scaly hide. The battle begins with the party yelling \"For Greenest!\"\n\nWe agreed that we wanted the guards to know we were on their side, and this seemed the most efficient rallying cry.  Alice calls first, but was drowned out .  We all yelled it at some point.\n\n&gt; Alice and Rickart start using their longbows to snipe at the enemy from the shadows, picking off kobolds and puncturing drake flesh - but not before the guards start taking losses.\n\nThere were five guards, and the layout of the field had us squaring off against the less dense group of enemies, and the guards rolled very badly against the horde of baddies.\n\n&gt; Couth held back at first, wanting to protect his family over all, but when the call to retreat tot he keep is sounded (and Nez announces how little time they have before the entry is closed to them), it becomes clear to him that the best way to protect them is to thin the enemy ranks and get them all inside.  He approaches the scrum with a steely purpose, and focuses his Qi to offer mighty blows against his foes.\n\nActually, he rolled pretty poorly and missed alot, but his hits were very effective.\n\nNez fired some eldritch beams but they had little effect.  Arrows did much of the work, clearing a path to make a dash for the lowering portcullis. Ricakrt makes it in first, losing his hat as he enters.  He is quickly followed by Couth's family, the man himself, and his comrades Nez and Alice. He notices his hat at the last moment, and makes a grab for it, and misses, the portcullis slamming into the ground.  Alice looks at him, and reaches through the bars to retrieve it.  Rickart accepts it sheepishly, not making eye contact.\n\nI joked about my delayed Indiana Jones hat moment, and the DM asked for a roll.  I announced that this was now not a joke, but cannon... and missed my roll.  It played out as above, and we left on a high note.",

        "text": "This is probably my most memorable experience with Sea of Thieves, an open-world pirate game for PC and Xbox One.\n\nI was sailing the high seas with my best crew, three other lads whom I'll call Captain, Johnny, and Bub. It had been a pretty uneventful night, so when we saw two galleons (the standard 4-man vessel) on the horizon, we wanted in on the action. It looked like one ship was chasing the other, with the pursued desperately racing toward an outpost. For those unfamiliar, outposts are islands where you can sell the treasure you've accumulated on your voyages. PvP is still enabled at outposts. It was obvious that the fleeing ship had been caught unawares, and was now desperately trying to save the gold they had collected.\n\nFor the sake of clarity, I'll call the chasing ship the Hostile Crew, and the fleeing ship the Grog Crew. We caught up to the ships just as the Grog Crew was pulling up to the outpost. At some point, one of our boys boarded their ship and told them our intentions to aid them. The Grog Captain graciously accepted. With the unexpected shift to a 2v1 battle, the Hostile Crew didn't stand a chance. We bombarded their ship and it descended to Davy Jones' Locker, with no sunken treasure as a prize.\n\nWith the battle over, we docked on the opposite side of the island. We boarded the Grog Ship, helping to patch up any remaining damage. The Grog Captain invited us to have a drink to celebrate. Johnny and Bub were already belowdeck and I was about to join them, when I heard a splashing sound in the water between the Grog Ship and the outpost.\n\nI look over to see our Cap carrying a chest in his arms, swimming to the shore. Once he was out of the Grog Crew's hearing range, he told us that they had forgotten to unload their treasure! While the Grog Crew were getting black-out drunk, we were selling off their loot. At least one of us stayed with the Grog Crew, drinking in responsible fashion and not raising suspicions, while they got completely hammered.\n\nAfter we had sold about half their treasure, they finally got wise. Johnny and I were ashore at the time, but Bub and Cap were back on the Grog Ship collecting more loot. They killed the two of them and immediately raised anchor. Sitting in a dark corner under a palm tree, I could tell by the trajectory of their galleon that they were going to loop around the island and come alongside our vacant ship.\n\nThankfully, that kind of maneuver requires sailing at a slow pace, and Bub and Cap were able to respawn on our ship before they could broadside us. The two of them raised our own anchor, and set off to engage them on the ocean waves. Johnny and I were still on the island, and we figured we would wait for a mermaid to appear. For those unfamiliar, mermaids spawn when you are far away from your ship and allow you to instantly teleport to it, although you cannot take any treasure with you. That didn't matter to us though, since we had already sold anything in our arms.\n\nWhile our vessel set out to sea for easier maneuverability, the Grog Ship stayed close to shore. At last, we understood their strategy. They assumed all four of us were back on our ship, and so they dispatched two crew members to come ashore with treasure to sell. It came as quite a surprise to them when we arose from our shady corners with pistols shoved in their grog-filled bellies. Two more treasure chests for us!\n\nThey only attempted this strategy once more before they turned to properly flee. By then, our ship was in a pretty good position and the mermaid for Johnny and myself had spawned. With a four man crew on the high seas, we sunk them with ease. After a few moments, their remaining treasure came bobbing up to the water's surface. Captain expressed remorse for double-crossing the Grog Crew, but I wouldn't have it. \"It's called Sea of Thieves, not Sea of Friends.\"",

        "text": "It all started on a lazy Sunday afternoon (in the early 90s). It was just the three of us, John (our usual gamemaster), Dave, and I.  Not enough people for any of our regular games, so John proposed we roll up disposable Top Secret characters and do something . . . not serious. So we did.\n\nNot wanting to do anything connected with our regular game, Dave decided his character was an operative for the Norwegian Secret Police, assigned to the embassy in Los Angeles. (We had no idea if Norway *had* a Secret Police, and we were pretty sure they didn't have an embassy in LA, but it sounded good at the time.) My character was a \"contractor,\" i.e., hired muscle. Between them, they had the IQ of a rotten, shriveled up turnip.\n\nNow, the Top Secret rules say that a new agent starts with a pistol and $400 cash. Dave's character was, indeed, issued a .357 revolver - but the ambassador wouldn't let him take it off of embassy ground. (And security searched him every. single. time. Not without reason.). My character had the $400, but was there was no one to issue him a pistol. So we pooled our resources, and procured a pistol for him on the black market. It was a \"rusty, Italian made .25 auto,\" that John told me couldn't do more than 5 point of damage (in a game where guns normally do up to 11). Based on the (lower than normal) PWV (Projective Weapon Value, which reflects, among other things, the accuracy of a gun) and the character's Offense value combat skill), I figured I only had about a 2/3 chance of being able to successfully commit suicide, with the gun in my ear canal, before I ran out of ammo. But dammit, I wasn't naked!\n\nSo, our first assignment was to investigate what a company called The Danner Corporation was doing off the coast of Norway. So investigate we did. Or, at least, Dave did. I was only half listening, while I played Mahjong on John's roommate's Mac. Dave's a . . . colorful guy (and so are his characters), but investigator, he's not. So he's running around like a chicken with its legs cut off (going nowhere fast), accomplishing nothing. Eventually, he gets bored, but we'd heard through the grapevine that somebody (the main characters, in fact) was offering a $100 million bounty for the destruction of a terrorist group in South America calling themselves The Fourth Reich. So we hopped a plane (on the embassy's dollar, mind you) to South Africa to recruit mercenaries.\n\nI think where we really went wrong was in not telling them what we were recruiting them *for*. So here's this reasonably well dressed guy with a funny accent that claimed to be from Norway, and a hired goon, spending money like there's no tomorrow (well, by local standards anyway) on guns and explosives. Well, what would *Norway* want with South African mercenaries? They figured he was Russian, working for the KGB, and we sort of accidentally started a revolutionary group. Oops. So we skedaddle back to Los Angeles.\n\nAt this point, we were several hours into the game, and Dave, frustrated at having accomplished pretty much *nothing*, demanded that I *participate*. OK, fine. I shut down the Mac, and moved to the table. Told John my character was calling the corporate headquarters of The Danner Corporation, and making an appointment with Mr. Danner. A few days later, we walked into his office and told him \"We're representatives of the government of Norway, and we'd like to know what you're doing off our coast.\"  He told us they were working on underwater magnesium mining, but the technology wasn't working out, so they were shutting the project down. And he gave us a copy of the project files. Simple as that. Total play time, about 15 minutes.\n\nSo we went back to my character's apartment, used a \"spy camera\" (a cheap disposable from the 7-11) to take pictures of everything, and wrote up a report about breaking into the Danner Corp's headquarters, eluding the guards, drugging the dogs, and stealing the info. The ambassador was so impressed with our work he gave us both a vacation in Greece, all expenses paid.\n\nNow, even this two mushrooms knew they couldn't smuggle a gun past airport security, but, Dave being Dave, and me being me, we found it morally objectionable to go to another country naked. So we obtained a polycarbonate knife, and successfully smuggled it onto the plane.\n\nThe plane, of course, was hijacked by a Libyan terrorist, who had a suicide bomb with a deadman switch. Now, we didn't want to spend our vacations (and the rest of our lives) in a Libyan internment camp, so we came up with a Clever Plan.\n\nStep One was to mug a stewardess for her uniform. (Both the characters were male, the cabin crew were all female.) It almost fit Dave's character, though the panty hose were a lost cause, and we left the stewardess, unconscious, in the bathroom wearing nothing but a bra (because Dave's character just didn't have the figure for it).\n\nStep Two was to get several cups of very, very hot coffee, and head to the cockpit.\n\nStep Three was to get the hijacker to open the cockpit door (so we could take him by surprise), then one of us would throw the hot coffee into his face while the other grabbed the deadman switch. And we had the polycarbonate knife to subdue him with! (Yeah, there are some flaws in this plan. But we chose not to examine them too closely.)\n\nWell, nobody answered the knock on the cockpit door, but we heard odd noises from the cockpit. So we opened the door, and found the pilot and copilot duct taped to their seats, and the hijacker asleep on the floor, with tape over the deadman switch. OK, New Plan.\n\nWe kicked the hijacker in the head a few times to make sure he *stayed* asleep, then used his remaining duct tape to wrap a plastic garbage bag around his neck to catch the blood, and stabbed him to death with the polycarbonate knife. We then took the blood soaked garbage bag and stuffed it - and the knife - out the window of the cockpit (no, the cockpit window of a jetliner doesn't open, especially at 30,000 feet, but the gamemaster was laughing too hard to point that out), Dave changed his clothes, and we returned to our seats like everything was perfectly normal.\n\nWhen we landed - almost on time - in Greece, the crew told the police what had happened, and picked us out of a lineup and everything, but . . . nobody believed such a crazy story. They figured the pilots were just shy about being hailed as the heroes of the day. Dave and I slipped quietly away. The other passengers remained mysteriously quiet, either because they didn't want to spend their vacations in interrogation rooms making a statement, or out of sheer terror of our characters.\n\nThe first thing we did was obtain black market guns - using the \"all expenses paid\" part of the vacation - and start looking for nightclubs.  After a few (too many) beers, we end up in the bathroom, where John tells us we walk in on a guy holding a gun on another guy. \n\nBackground note: The very first Top Secret game we ever played, Rich's character walked in on the same scene: a mugging. No skin off *his* teeth, he unzips to go about his business. And the mugger demands his wallet, too. So Rich pulls out a gun and shoots him dead. The victim starts to thank him profusely, and Rich says, \"Don't thank me yet. Give me your wallet.\" You think D&amp;D encourages murder hobos . . .\n\nSo, it looks like we've walked in on a replay. Dave was willing to assume it was what it looked like. I knew John was more twisted than that, and (mostly just to be contrary) offered the opinion that it was probably a cop arresting a criminal. And Dave and I got into an argument about which one of them we should shoot.\n\nNow, the cop, arresting the Russian spy he'd seen climb over the embassy wall, didn't speak a word of English, and only knew that there were two maniacs with guns yelling at each other. The Russian spy, however, spoke perfect English, and knew he had a 50/50 chance of losing this lottery, and pulled out a f*cking hand cannon and nearly blew Dave's leg off with one shot. A brief gun fight later, the Russian was dead, and the cop was grateful enough to look the other way while we hightailed it.\n\nIt was a *great* vacation. Other than the medical expenses.\n\nNow, at this point, these characters are sort of growing on us all, so we got an offer to work for a mysterious organization known only as The OA (there's a story behind that name, but that's for another time) - this was the organization the main characters were part of.\n\nOur first mission was to investigate a new revolutionary group in South Africa.\n\nSo we told them we'd need at least $50,000 in flash money (which was a lot more money 20+ years ago). We used a very small amount to get custom tailored KGB uniforms made, flew to South Africa, walked into the camp, and had them give us a full report on their progress. We spent a couple of weeks traveling (on the flash money), wrote up a report that made the one on the Danner Corporation look like the very picture of accuracy, and embezzled the rest of the flash money. Mission successful!\n\nOur next mission was to help rescue one of the Partners who ran the agency (Code Name: Psycho Bitch, but **never** to her face), who had been kidnapped by Palestinian terrorists in the Middle East. Overall, the mission wasn't especially noteworthy, until the end, when Dave and I *got lost* looking for the bathroom in a restaurant, found the entrance to the secret tunnel, and . . . rescued Psycho Bitch single (or double, as the case may be) handed. Yeah, let's go with that. We rescued her. (Real story: When they grabbed her, they searched her for weapons. And kept finding more and more. In the end, they ended up stripping her to her underwear, and handcuffing her to a steel chair, and started interrogating her. In a series of die rolls we all watched, it turned into Black Widow's intro scene in The Avengers - 30 years before the movie. She beat them to death with the chair, while still tied to it, and escaped. We found her wandering through the tunnels in her underwear, gave her something to wear, and followed her out because we were still lost.)\n\nSo, despite being drooling morons, we were the heroes of the day. Again. Our reward this time was that we were each given a fully tricked out car from The OA's Auto Shop, with souped up engines, armor, etc. They were tiny (and ugly, and non-descript) little Fiats, mind you, but still. We were also given an income sufficient to rent a chalet in Switzerland as our home base. But even a Swiss chalet gets old after a while, so we took another vacation. (Another lazy Sunday afternoon.)\n\nThis time, we went to Portugal, driving in Dave's car. Which promptly got blown up by Basque terrorists (in a completely unrelated incident - they were aiming for an army general, and Basque terrorists were not known for being the most competent people in the world). OK, maybe Portugal wasn't a good idea. We take a train back and pick up my car, and head for Italy.\n\nWhere my car gets stolen (I did *not* leave the keys in the ignition, dammit!). While we are in a tiny little town, 20 miles from the nearest train station. So we hit the road, on foot, thumbs out. The first car that we see going our way it a large, black limousine, which pulls off to the side of the road not too far from us. And a body rolls out, into the ravine beside the road, and the limo drives away. We hid in the bushes.\n\nThe next car we see coming is . . . mine. So we both pull out our guns and start blazing away at the bastard. We didn't accomplish anything, since the car was bulletproof, but the driver drove away swearing he was going to beat the hell out of the cousin he'd borrowed the car from.\n\nWe never did report the cars stolen/destroyed, because we were more than a little afraid of our new employers.\n\nOur next assignment was to . . . well, we were a little fuzzy on exactly what we were supposed to accomplish, but it started off by investigating a servered human head underneath a hot water heater in an apartment in East Berlin (this was back where there still *was* an East Germany). We were given a car that wouldn't attract attention in East Germany. It was a boring Audi clone, and it was boring. So we stole another, more interesting looking BMW out of a long term parking structure. It turned out it was James Bond's car (and he hunted us for some time afterwards). We figured that out three days later when we got into a chase (we were the ones being chased) with the East German police, and we found out the windows didn't roll down (because they were two inch thick bullet proof glass). But there were gun ports. And a button on the gear shifter that activated the nitrous oxide system, giving the car a big power boost. We discovered all this after driving the car for three days.\n\nWe got away. For a while. After we blew up the jetliner, sitting on the runway, fully loaded and ready to take off, we ended up in another chase with the authorities, only this time, instead of crappy Russian made cars, they brought a MiG. Desperate, we tried the magic button again, and found out that when already at maximum speed, instead of nitrous, it ignited the JATO bottles in the trunk, and we literally few *over* Checkpoint Charlie at 300 mph in a BMW, careened off a building, and somehow (luck points, IIRC) managed to stagger away and fade into West Berlin. Our shoes smelled like vomit.\n\nSadly, the game sort of petered off after that as we went back to Chivalry &amp; Sorcery, so the two morons never really got what they had coming to them.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/87bs8w/how_much_a_death_can_improve_the_game_mutants/",
        "text": "This does apply to general storytelling at places, but this was a reminder that a death isn't just to shock the viewer or to give a short-term fakeout. It can set the tone and show actions have consequences. Heroism isn't always glorious.\n\nThe game is based on the book series Wild Cards. For those not in the know, I'd describe it as urban fantasy. Basically in 1946, an alien virus was released on Earth that initially infected ten thousand or so people, with more infections coming when spores are exposed after carried by wind or international freight, or when those infected or just carriers of the virus pass it to their children. 90% of the infected die outright, 9% become mutants of a random kind called Jokers (some with powers, others just looking weird), 1% gain superpowers while retaining their human appearance called Aces. There are also latents who may or may not manifest it later in life or carriers who can pass it down, but can't manifest it themselves. In present day, Jokers are around 0,5% of the Earths population and depending on the era and place, are discriminated against.\n\nWe're playing 4 teenage jokers, all attending the first year of Jokertown High School. A sharkboy, a humanoid plant (me), a kitsune and an angel (whether you were a joker or an ace was rolled randomly, as well as your joker power). So far they had been pulled into some vigilante-shennanigans mainly revolving around a plan to resurrect one of the most powerful villain aces, which they managed to foil.\n\nA month passes in timeskip and things are heating up again, as we learn some organization called Pilgrim Group is doing something shady with fake police officers and paying teenage Jokers for some blood tests and such. So we're investigating an abandoned building they're supposedly using, though for the time being just planning to get a general look from the outside so we can make a better plan and come back the next day. That is until one of us hears screaming from the inside, so we go in to check it out. We manage to stay hidden while we find two other jokers tied to a chair, about to be injected with something by some of the fake cops. Since we don't act fast enough and hesitate about them potentially working for a government agency due to one detail we notice, the injection turns one of the jokers into a mess of blood and pieces of him all over the room. \n\nHere things start to go down fast. See, the sharkboy has a flaw where he has to make a will save every time he smells blood or go into a feeding frenzy. He fails and goes berserk on the guys, attacking them before any of us can try and restrain him. While he's strong enough to easily take down a few armed men alone, one of them managed to hit him with a syringe, which we presume to be the same stuff as what turned one joker into bloody giblets. While we manage to take out 3/4 of them while one gets away (that being the guy with the injections) and restrain the sharkboy for a while, we notice his skin is starting to dry up something fierce. He soon takes off running towards a nearby stream, mostly because he has healing factor while wet. However that doesn't work. Instead he kept drying up, until the injection just caused him to explode into a cloud of dust, becoming the first casualty we faced, be it the group or even a bystander.\n\nKeep in mind, this wasn't a team of teenage superheroes like Teen Titans or such. These were just regular teenagers, who happened to have powers, that got pulled into these situations and acted with no backing or authorization. So you can imagine them being somewhat traumatized by this event. Since this happened halfway through the session, the rest is just everyone dealing with the loss of their friend. Kitsune skips school entirely, angel claims to go, but instead just hangs with his girlfriend, plant-man tries to get his mind off the death as well as stay away from home and his father so he tries to attend classes like normal. Oh yea, they had earlier found out my characters father is doing something with the Pilgrim Group, though I had so far not let him know that I knew. After the death he furiously yelled at his father for lying and working with the sharkboys killers, though still getting nothing but evasive answers. Everyone is depressed, everyone is doubting if they can carry on with the kind of risk it entails both to themselves and the rest of the group and everyone tries to deal with the trauma in some way. And some damn good roleplaying comes out of it. \n\nNow I should mention sharkboys player said that he had planned for his character to die and change to another one, though leaving the method of his death to GM. Though I believe most suspected it since \n 1) it was a rather harsh way to die to just one succesful attack that even his high saves couldn't negate, only delay . He also seemed pretty chill about dying in that manner\n 2) He had a new character ready and that one entered the game during that same session\n\nStill doesn't take away from the fact that the game has changed and none of us knew this at the time. Our characters can no longer assume it'll all work out, since we now have proof it doesn't always go like that. Sure, meta-wise they have to go on or there's no game, but it'll only come out after every character sorts out how to handle the trauma. And once they do, it's time to plan how to get our friends killer in jail.",

        "text": "One day a few friends and I met up for our weekly game. Normally we are a group of 6-8 depending on who shows but today it was only the DM, me, my friend from out of town (L), and one other member of our group (A). DM decided that our usual game was suspended for the week but we could do a one shot he had prepared. I don’t remember every character but I was a dwarven forge cleric, the DM played a ranger, L was a human rogue, and A was some kind of melee character. \n\nWe are in a tavern and find out a number of suspicious people have been seen going in and out a cave, so we go to investigate. Our first stop is a local who has been investigating. A started asking stupid questions so I cast silence on him, forgetting it was an AOE spell. The rest of the conversation was done by writing things on some parchment which was not enacted IRL thankfully as my handwriting is illegible. \n\nWe find out where the cave is and head over there. We get lost in the labyrinth of tunnels and end up in the room where the cultists are but way too high in the air and no one had feather fall and there was no where to tie a rope. Then I get an idea. Standing back from the edge of the tunnel so no one could see me I used thaumaturgy to cause my voice to echo. I then pretended to be the god they were worshiping and told them I was sending four representatives and asked how to navigate the caves. Apparently the DM though it was funny enough that I didn’t have to make a roll and we quickly found ourselves back in the room, but on the floor. \n\nA was the first to speak to the cultists. “We were wandering what exactly this ritual of yours is attempting to do?” \n\n“We’re trying to summon a vampire.” Cane the reply. They told us they had been sending zombies through a portal for the vampire to eat so it would join them. \n\n“You’re feeding a vampire zombies?” I asked. “No wonder it isn’t here yet. Have you ever tasted zombie blood? It tastes terrible!” \n\nBefore the cultist could respond L added by asking “Did the zombies sign the consent forms?”\n\nThe zombies had, unsurprisingly, not signed the consent forms. Murmurs of “the head office won’t like this” and how unorthodox the summoning circle was led to worrying that the cultists may be fired. \n\nSomehow it was established that we were from HR and they were not welcome working for our god (even though we didn’t worship that god or know which one it was).  A fight broke out and the circle was used. Releasing not a vampire but a demon. At this point we just said ‘I knew that circle looked wrong’ (we hadn’t even checked) and the cultists gave up an went home had to fight the demon though and I died. ",

        "text": "Welcome to the story of the time I won a card game by doing basically nothing.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, the card game One Night Ultimate Werewolf follows an objective similar to that of Mafia, Town of Salem, and the like: Find the werewolf/werewolves and lynch at least one of them. There are many roles, each with their own actions (minus normal civilians) during the 'night' like switching roles of other characters and so on, but the only ones that are important for this story are werewolf, seer, and robber. I'll explain when I get there. The cards are distributed randomly, with the three unpicked, unknown cards in the middle of the playing table.\n\nThe game starts and we all grab our cards. I hate getting the werewolf, as I'm not the best liar and get obviously very nervous whenever I do get it. It's our second game of the night and I pick a card from the middle, flipping it over to find out that I have assumed the role of 'Robber', meaning that during the night, I switch my card with another player's card, look at my new role, and assume it.\n\nThe 'night' starts, we all close our eyes, and eventually, the narrator gets to the robber's turn. Open your eyes, it (we use an app) says, and it instructs me to perform my action. I look left and right, finally just choosing to switch with the person nearest to me - my brother. I switch my card with his, look at my new role, and what is it? Werewolf. Of course it is.\n\nThis had never happened before, and I wasn't sure how I was going to pull this off, but I closed my eyes again and waited for the night to end.\n\nMy brother at this point has no idea that his card has been switched. I know he checks to make sure the card is in the same spot when he 'wakes up', so I did my best to make sure it was exactly where and how he had left it.\n\nHe generally leads our werewolf gameplay and the story was no different now, meaning my deceit had worked. \"Good news, guys,\" He started off confidently, \"I'm the seer.\" \n\nThe seer card gives the ability to look at one player card or two cards out of the three leftover cards in the middle. I knew immediately as he said this that he was the only werewolf in play. With two or more werewolves present, they have no nightly action other than to open their eyes during the night to find out who the other werewolves are. A lone werewolf is allowed to look at two of the center cards.\n\n\"I looked in the middle at these two,\" he said, pointing at the nearest two center cards. \"They're both werewolves.\"\n\nThere's an initial sense of something between disbelief and disappointment amongst the rest of us, having expected a more difficult game. As the new lone werewolf, I win so long as I am not lynched, so I play as though I fully believe him. The rest are, of course, hesitant. I ask why we aren't skipping to the vote - he just said there's no werewolves, so we can just skip to the vote and not lynch anyone, meaning the civilians would win. They remind me that they can't be sure he's not the werewolf and just looked in the center. I fake realization and we start going through everyone's roles. Some other cards were switched around the table, and it becomes clear that no one switched out my werewolf card. I quickly blurt out that I was the robber and switched with a girl who claimed to have been one of the two civilian cards. She's in the middle of discussing the action of another card with another player, so she agrees easily and everyone seems to buy it.\n\nThe timer runs out and it's time to vote. Everyone is still skeptical of my brother, and as we are told to vote, all hands point accusingly to him as he's still desperately trying to convince us that he's the seer. He sighs as he's lynched and must now show his card.\n\nIf a werewolf is lynched, all the civilian roles gain a point, so he thought he'd just ended up a point behind everyone.\n\nThe civilian cards (which includes, more or less, everything that's not a werewolf) win a point if they kill a werewolf, while the werewolf gains a point if a civilian is killed. The general consensus was that either he was the lone werewolf or the seer, meaning if they killed the werewolf, they would gain a point, and if they had just killed the seer, no one would gain anything, so they assumed they had nothing to lose.\n\nHe smiled in that you-got-me way as he flipped over his card, and that smile fading to confusion was perhaps the most satisfying thing I've ever seen. He asked, \"What?\" and all eyes turned to me as I flipped over my (now werewolf) card, and explained what happened.\n\nTo date, that was the most strategic point I've ever won - by doing nothing and letting my brother (and everyone else) think he was a werewolf.",

        "text": "Hey all! I usually post my shadowrun stories on dndgreentext but haven't gotten too much response so thought I'd start posting here. Hope you enjoy!\n\nJust a backstory I run a homebrew shadowrun campaign set in cleveland with interesting plothooks while keeping to the city and lore. The party consists of a troll martial artists, an elf psychopath, and a hacker (decker) who just wants to pay the bills.  \n\nSo today I picked up from our last session, the players had recently cut off the head of a vengeful shadowrunner who had a disagreement on a drone ownership, specifically his. Their body harvesters were in a gang war and desperately needed medical supplies and even offered them 30% on the bioware in the severed head (a steal from the usual 10%). My players decided to hit a platinum membership ambulance in East Cleveland (E security rating) for the supplies. \n\nThe session starts and the decker decides to poach MeFeed profiles for students who wanted to party in tourist town of E.C after midterms. They found a party crew and offered services as bodyguard with the intent to get one of them to call their ambulance to ambush. They did not background check them and didn't notice one of them was a daughter of a tir tairngire diplomat to UCAS. My intention was her father gave her high membership from Crash Cart for medical services and biomonitor for emergencies. She wanted to tag along to hit up a Yakuza den to \"experience a Bunraku parlor. I've been locked up in the Tir, I want power.\" \n\nSo they set up premeeting at Soybucks with the partiers, plan out the party route, and meeting place. The players plan on leading them to an ambush, forcing them at gunpoint to call the ambulance, and ambush it when it drives up a horrendous chock point. They even figure out explosives to ambush the inevidable Ares Roadmaster, not that they ended up needing it. The psychopath would clear out the ambush area and set up shop with his sniper rifle. \n\nFIrst they go to the Just Us Lounge and watch some Urban Brawl with the Cleveland Commandos winning the game against Cincinnati and the Cleveland Browns going 0-69 against fuck knows who (queue the blowjob shots at the bar). To make their job easier, the troll pc gave the human victim a shot of Hurlg (an extremely potent alcoholic beverage meant for orks and trolls, 160-180 proof with mildly hallucinogenic propertics of large amounts. Plus stomach cramps for humans). He was not handling it well. The Tir girl meanwhile was just watching and more exciting for her depraved entertainment she can only get with the Yaks. \n\nAfter the games the players took them to what they thought was Tsu's Seafood but took a detour. The Tir girl noticed the route was different and was highly skeptical of the \"its for vip guests\" excuse. She quietly did a check in with her Crash Cart provider (basically a \"if I don't message 'I'm' ok in 5 minutes please assume I'm in danger\" feature). The decker decided to snoop on her phone and cancel the call. However, he failed a Hack on the Fly check and alerted her, causing her to freak out and try to escape. One struggle later and they got 2 drunks and one defiant elf to the ambush spot. \n\nThe Tir girl was defiant and warned them she was the daughter of a diplomat and that \"My father will have your balls on a platter\". Now this is where things go off the rails. I was expecting them to call the ambulance and ambush with shadowrunner stats to make an exciting gun battle without HTR TPKing the party. I was not expecting the psychopath with qualities specifically tailored for a psychopath to take his sniper rifle, shove it down her throat to intimidate her, and then the troll to sneak up and pull the trigger. \n\nAt this point, her biomonitor was screaming and signaling HTR as this is now a diplomatic incident. Wanting to clean up witnesses, my players gunned down the remaining two college kids in the car. When one of the bleeding out students asked for a last drink, the troll took the bottle and forced him to drink the entire bottle, causing him to asphyxiate. A condition the players did nothing to stop. At this point my players realized they went too far and proceeded to book it deeper into E.C. Good thing too as a minute later a military helicopter swooped in and rappled in spec ops soldiers. My players are now currently hold up in an abandoned building planning how to escape a pissed off nation and corporations such as Docwagon, Evo, and Aztechnology who wish to exploit this for more security/medical contracts.\n\nEdit: grammar and clarification",

        "text": "This is a large chunk of text, I am sorry.\n\nBefore I start the post, I will mention that this is a sort of half rpg horror story, half question for people on Reddit to help settle something.\n\nImportant information\nThis is a story about a group of 5 people, 4 of which are players. I am the group’s cleric, but will refer to myself as me for simplicity. We are all level 2.\n\nCharacter alignments (semi important)\nMe: Neutral Good\nWarlock: neutral\nWizard: neutral \nBarbarian: chaotic good\n\nOne session a few weeks ago, my DND group met up to play a game of 5e. We are playing (and have yet to finish) the module Lost Mines Of Phandelver. We had arrived at the town of Phandellin, which our Dm describes as a town full of people. We are currently on the outside of the town, where we spot a small child, and the situation unfolds. \n\nDm: you see a small child kicking a ball, around age 7.\n\nWizard: I walk up to him and begin to tell him, “kill yourself”\n\nDm: Ok.\n\nWarlock: I decide to join in and tell him he is right and that the child is worthless.\n\nDm: you do that, upsetting the child.\n\nBarbarian: what is the child wearing?\n\nDm: uh, I don’t know, (makes up random clothing) like iron armor? \n\nBarbarian: and does he have any gold?\n\nDm: sure, he has 20 gold so he can buy food at the market. \n\nBarbarian: I want it rob him.\n\nWarlock: Hey hold up, I would like to rob him first\n\nThis devolves into them both rolling to see who gets the chance to rob the child first, while me and the wizard just stand there, and I am telling them to stop.\n\nWarlock: I rob the child since I rolled higher.\n\nDm: the small child notices, and turns around.\n\nBarbarian: Oh crap, ok I attack the child!\n\nDm: ok, roll initiative.\n\nAt this point I’m telling the Dm I want to intervene, to which he responds that “no, you can’t do that, I want to watch where this goes.”\n\nMe: what the hell, that’s not fair I want to stop them from killing him.\n\nBarbarian: I attack him! (Rolls 20) critical hit! \n\nDm: you cleave the child in half.\n\nBarbarian: I harvest his souls and turn it into gold.\n\nMe: what in God’s name are you doing! Guys, really, stop. \n\nDm: it’s worth 20 gold.\n\nBarbarian: ok I share half with warlock.\n\nDm: ok, the mother now runs over screaming as she sees her child dead.\n\nBarbarian: I kill her too. *rolls high enough*\n\nDm: ok she’s dead.\n\nMe: why are you guys doing this!?\n\nWe go on it find out they were the family of the leader of the red brand ruffians, prompting the biggest pile of retcon BS ever.\n\nWarlock: see! The child was going to be very dangerous! We did everyone a favor by killing him.\n\nMe: no we did not! We killed a *small* freaking *child*. What is wrong with you!?\n\nWarlock: whatever, stop being such a lawfag! (If you don’t know what this means, it’s basically a reference to the SMT video game series where players call each other chaos or law fags depending on their alignments in the game)\n\nBarbarian: yeah, law fag. \n\nAnd so it began. From then forth, I immediately lost every shred of dignity or credibility I had. You see, even before that, they all called me a stupid cleric since I played the life domain, and constantly bothered me about it. They’d gotten people at school to start going like “shut up you *cleric*” as well, despite not even having played. After that session, however, everything went downhill. I was now constantly called a law fag and had a “morale high horse”. It wasn’t just in game, but out of game too. Any argument or debate: shut down by being called a law fag. Any time I tried to do something aligned to my morals (both in and out of game, as I made my character to parallel most of my ideals), I was told to get off my high horse. I have tried to calmly reason with them many times, and they have said that I should stop virtue signaling and acting like I’m better for doing things I perceive as more moral. I had agreed I may have been partially guilty of said things, and said I’d try to stop if they stopped, which they did not. They have gotten many people to call me law fag who don’t even know what they’re talking about, and even teachers to say that I have a moral high horse. This is just one in a string of many things they have done in game that is very messed up (before, in a one off that was a backstory for the wizard, the wizard executed a goblin father who plead for his life after maiming him and failing 4 attempts at magic missile before killing him) this is my side of the story \n\nNow their side of the story, as every coin has two sides\n\nIn their version, they are heroes who helped save a town from a tyrant’s heir and destabilized the Mafia. When they found out who was the child’s father, they said that the child was the next super dictator and that he would’ve killed a bunch of people. In addition, they also día synagogue killing him was for survival, and that they needed the gold, which we clearly did not (we each had around 1,500 gold from selling a supply wagon to a trader. Also the gold is the standard value of gold in 5e). We also were apparently going to starve without the gold, as we needed lots of food, even though I can make food as a cleric. After the session, we met up again a week or so later, and this time, the warlock tricked the wizard into signing over his soul, and then charged him all his gold for it back, and revealing he never had his soul in the first place. How do we fix this you ask? We rob barthen’s provisions for 2000 gold and leave him an invisibility cloak because the wizard needs cash, despite my various offers of my gold to him after I got all my spell materials so as to stop the burglary.\n\nI am posting this a month or 2 after it happened,  and everyone in the group wanted this post to be made to see who is in the right. *disclaimer* Even though this post makes it seem like my friends are mean (or maybe not), they’re still very cool guys and really fun to hang out with, so no friendships have been destroyed, we’re all fine. This is all just to settle an argument.\n\nTL;DR: this post is very long, sorry. My group killed a child, stopped me from intervening (and later said that I am in fact an a murderer for not stopping them), killed the kid’s mom, then sabotaged each other for gold, and robbed some dude. Say I am a lawfag. ",

        "text": "Chevall Chorgan Stonehand\n\nPaladin of Sarenrae\n\nMember of the Stonehand Dwarf Clan\n\nThe Stonehand Clan was a well-respected clan of dwarf smiths. They served directly under an important dwarven noble house, outfitting the Lord's personal guard with custom-made hammers and maces. The clan’s treasure was called the “Sword of Generations,” an ornate longsword which had been improved by the 7th son of the 7th son throughout every generation of the Stonehand clan. This tradition started with the family’s oldest known ancestor, Belgrath Stonehand, who mined the original metal for the blade from a fallen star, or so the legend goes. \n\nChorgan, the seventh son of the seventh son of the latest generation, was the last one to work with the blade. Being young for a Dwarf, Chorgan was still in a phase of finding himself. This included a search for a God to worship, a search for his place in the world, and of course, pursuits of passion. The target of his pursuit was none other than Lilliara Firemane, daughter of a rival clan of smiths. On this fateful night, however, it was this secretive affair that would lead to the ruin of both clans. Jealous of the Stonehands’ prowess and the special favor the Stonehands received, the Firemanes were planning a deadly raid- and Lilliara chose to warn Chorgan. She begged him to flee and save himself. He told her that he would, but instead returned home and prepared his family. Lilliara was among the attackers that night, and she despaired to see Chorgan and the rest of his clan with weapons bared. Chorgan's father, Belgrath Stonehand the eighth, offered the attackers an olive branch, a chance to set their weapons aside and dine with the family in peace. The Firemanes, set in their bloodlust, refused. With roars of fury, the dwarf clans descended upon each other.\n\nWhen the dust settled, only Chorgan and Lilliara survived, both sustaining heavy injuries. Chorgan fled, leaving behind the Sword of Generations. \n\nAt the precipice of death, Chorgan was saved by Sarenrae, who manifested in the form of a golden angel. From that day on, he swore to serve her. He is one of her only followers in Neverwinter, but seeks to spread her word of life and mercy. Despite the slight that she and her clan performed against him and his, Chorgan has forgiven Lilliara. He seeks vengeance not only for his clan, but for all life taken unjustly.",

        "text": "A couple years ago I joined a D&amp;D group begun by some of my friends from theatre. As I'd never played before (all I knew about tabletop gaming at the time was from watching Counter Monkey videos), I was given a pre-made starter character - a lawful good human fighter.\n\nThis was the group's second session. Our DM gave a brief recap before continuing, announcing that we had been teamed up as part of a tournament in this kingdom. Our job was to defend a hill from attackers who could come from any of the four compass directions.\n\nFor a while, everything was going simple. All these characters were level 1 (there may have been one or two who were level 2 but I don't know) so none of the enemies were too difficult to defeat. We were making quick work of most of the attackers.\n\nUntil, on my side of the field, we had to deal with one particularly feisty attacker. This guy kept shrugging off my arrows and those of the other hunter guarding that side of the hill, firing a few himself and getting a couple hits.\n\nFinally, he fell. As the lawful good fighter whose motivation in life was to be a hero, I knew exactly what to do.\n\nI walked over and cut off his head.\n\nAt this point, I'm sure some of you see where I went wrong. The other players did too, and tried to talk me out of it, but I insisted, theorizing that my LG character, seeing this attacker die, would want to ensure it did not rise again. So the DM allowed it, making it clear that I'd messed up (a flash of a vision of a wife and child, which annoyed me due to its cliche-ness), then we continued the fight.\n\nOnce the remaining attackers had been dispatched, we all gathered back where the tournament had begun. The DM, as the land's king, announced: \"Healers, you may now go and revive all down fighters.\"\n\nOops.\n\nI had no idea that enemies (or for that matter player characters) could be revived once brought down to zero hit points.\n\nWe were brought into the throne room. The king handed out our rewards, then announced, \"Unfortunately, one of our fighters was unable to be revived, so we will have to take a small amount of gold as a fine.\" He was about to say that they weren't going to pursue exactly who did it, but in unison everyone pointed at me.\n\nI had one chance, a persuasion roll to explain the blunder as due to the heat of combat. My fighter had a minus-1 perception, so I needed a good roll on the d20 to get out with relatively minor punishment.\n\nThe number that came up on the die was 2.\n\nMy fighter ended up sentenced to a long time in the stocks, a massive fine, being required to work menial labor to pay the entire the fine (which included supporting the dead attacker's family), stripped of his weaponry, and a prohibition to carry any weaponry in the kingdom's limits.\n\nI was given a new starter character for the next session.",

        "text": "**The Players**:\nBerrian: Wood Elf Ranger\nLune: Dark Elf Paladin\nFriend: Lune’s Shield Guardian Companion\nOri: Mountain Dwarf Monk\nFilia (NPC): Lieutenant of the District 2 Police Force\n\n**The Story So Far**:\n\nBerrian, Lune, Ori, and a few others made their way to the lost city of Arru, hidden deep beneath the Verd Mountains. Upon finding the city, they found that a cult worshipping the goddess Takisis was attempting to use the city’s magical power supply (a large crystal located at the center of the city) to bring forth demons and other dark forces.\n\nThe party killed the apparent leader of the cult, as well as a Cambion that he summoned, thus saving the city. As a result, the city now floats through the sky. \n\nAfter some quests throughout the city, the party uncovered a corruption/racketeering plot in District 2 of the city. After some investigation, which led to a meeting with the Bloodlight- the citywide thieve’s guild- they joined forces with Lieutenant Filia- the right hand woman of the District 2’s corrupt captain of the guard, and set out to put an end to the corruption.\n\n**Current Events**:\n\nAfter some talking, friendly sparring, and waiting, the Ori, Lune, Friend, Berrian, and Filia set out to an appointed meeting with the Bloodlight which was to take place at midnight. The plan was for Filia to hide while the rest of the group took the meeting. That way she would be able to find evidence that the Bloodlight actually existed, as well as evidence of its dealings within the precinct.\n\nHowever, upon arriving at the meeting place, the party found only debris and a magic ward on the ground. After some investigating, as well as old fashioned brute force, Ori and Lune managed to break the ward, revealing a way underground.\n\nGoing down the newly discovered hole eventually led to the homebase of the Bloodlight, and a brief encounter with a patrol.\nUpon killing one of the patrol, and interrogating the other- an elf named Ithryn- the party learned that the leader of the Bloodlight is doing something at the city docks. Since everyone promised to keep Ithryn safe  in exchange for that information, Lune escorted her back to the party’s homebase before returning to continue towards the docks.\n\nIn the meantime, Ori, Berrian, and Friend scouted further, and knocked out 7 more bloodlight members. Filia guarded the entrance the party found until Lune returned. \n\nWhen the party was finally reunited, they continued to the docks. There, they found themselves in a massive cylindrical shaft that stretched above and below them with airships docked along the sides. Not long after entering, it became apparent that a platform carrying Zaghak (the leader of the Bloodlight), Erwin (a “mystic” Bloodlight member planted in the precinct), and 9 other Bloodlight members. \n\nWhen the platform was close, Filia, Friend, Lune, and Berrian jumped on and began the fight: the 4 of them against 11 enemies. \n\nThe battle started out rough. Berrian was able to get another hit on both Zaghak and Erwin, but Erwin quickly turned herself invisible. Filia was locked in combat with one of the Bloodlight grunts, but neither could really hit the other. Friend was in the same situation, but it managed to knock its enemy prone. \n\nBerrian and Lune were ganged up on by two grunts. After exchanging blows, Erwin cast fireball, disintegrating one the grunts, and damaging the other grunt, Berrian, and Lune. Luckily Berrian and Lune were able to avoid some of the damage. Meanwhile, Zaghak focused his efforts on Friend, who was a giant target.\n\nBerrian and Lune were quickly surrounded by enemies. Erwin, still invisible, used another Fireball, this time on Filia and Friend. They managed to avoid the brunt of the attack, but the two grunts they were fighting were obliterated.\n\nAfter that, the tables started to turn. The enemies around Berrian and Lune started to drop, and Filia, by a stroke of luck, ran into the invisible Erwin on the way to another enemy. A well placed hit from Filia made Erwin’s invisibility dissipate, and Berrian killed her shorty after- her lifeless body dropping down the shaft.\n\nMore enemies fell, until there was only Zaghak and one of his grunts remaining. The platform, which had been moving over the course of this battle, finally reached the top. Zaghak attempted an escape, but two well placed arrows from Berrian took his life as well.\n\nAttempts to interrogate the last grunt failed, and he chose to leap off the platform, and use a grappling hook to escape. \n\nWhile the battle was raging, Ori, after some difficulty, successfully hijacked one of the airships. He flew it up to meet everyone else on the platform to find all the enemies dead. However, using the airship, the party stole the cargo the Bloodlight was escorting, and set out to deliver to a safe and trustworthy source.",

        "text": "A couple of weekends ago, I went to a small convention called Cleveland Concoction.  There I played in a hilarious game of Star Trek Adventures, a tabletop rpg.  Boy did we mail the fission first class express.\n\nThe background is that the party is the bridge crew of a ship from a mirror universe.  I'm not super familiar with Star Trek lore, just so you know. In our universe, everything is kind of opposite.  The Federation doesn't exist, instead there is a warmongering, fascist Second Terran Empire.  This empire is currently at war with the Romulan Empire and losing.  However, the Terrans have learned of a super weapon in the canon universe (the one where the shows take place) called Genesis.  You know, the thing from Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan.  I played the role of Chief Engineer.  The other players were the First Officer, Science Officer, Conn (which I was told is the pilot or navigator, someone like Chekov or Zulu), Chief of Security, and of course the Political Officer.  I didn't catch anyone's name unfortunately.  We quickly determined that the \"Political Officer\" was something like a babysitter whose purpose on the ship was to make sure everyone toes the party line and serves the interests of the empire.  I guess his player figured he probably has his own political ambitions as well.  More about that later.\n\nThe story begins with our ship being ambushed by Romulans.  Our ship takes some damage and about half the crew is killed, including the captain.  We manage to escape by activating the device which allows us to travel between universes.  We arrive in the canon universe smoking but still flying.  I checked over the ship and found her better off than she looked.  Nothing critical had been damaged, however the universe-hopping device was busted.  We decided to continue with the mission until I could come up with a solution.\n\nThere were a lot of wounded and no medical officer, so first officer orders the science officer to the medbay to do triage.  She's doing her best but, damn it, she's a scientist not a doctor!  Suddenly, up pops the ship's AI hologram of some sort.  None other than an imitation of Khan Noonien Singh.  In our universe he's a staunch pacifist and proponent of harmony and peace in the galaxy.  As loyal members of the glorious Terran military, he disgusts us.  He requests to make several copies of himself so that he can more efficiently diagnose the numerous wounded we have, but since we don't trust this hippie bastard the science officer declined.\n\nWith the situation back under control, we headed for Regula, the planetoid where Genesis was located.  First officer had me disable the IFF transponder and do what I could to cloak the ship so we wouldn't be detected by Starfleet.  Along the way, political officer meets up with first officer in the captain's office.  There he gives the acting captain an ultimatum.  Political officer is going to take all the credit for this mission.  If the first officer tries to take the spotlight away, political officer will let slip to high command of a few passionate nights first officer spent with some green ladies of the night on some back water planet in his younger days.  First officer is insulted by the threat, but ultimately not worried about it.  What's wrong with having a little fun with the locals every now and then?  He sternly orders political officer back to his post.\n\nWe aren't detected, so the rest of the trip to Regula is uneventful.  When we get there we find a small station near an asteroid and no other ships.  The station doesn't appear to be armed so we begin to active scan the station and the asteroid.  The station appears to be some kind of research facility and there's a few people in it.  The asteroid is hollow and full of life, but it's all algae and bacteria and stuff.  Also, there's a small area just on the edge of the cavity that our scanners can't penetrate.  First officer wants us to check out the asteroid first since there's no one there and the dark area could be where the weapon is hidden.  Out of spite he orders the political officer down first to scout things out.  There's a brief argument.  \n\n\"What?! Why?!  That's not my job!  Send the security team down to make sure it's safe.\"  Political officer protests.\n\n\"I'm your captain, and you'll do as I command!\"  First officer insists threateningly.\n\nPolitical officer flat out refuses, so first officer takes out his phaser and attempts to shoot him in the face.  He dodges and returns fire.  We are now at our objective and there is a phaser battle happening *on our command bridge* between the senior leadership.  Science officer suddenly has to go check on things in the medbay.  I've got some calibrations to get to in the nacelles.  We all look to the security officer, who has a very important decision to make.  She decides to fire on the first officer who is mortally wounded.  Political officer regains his composure and ruthlessly takes command of the ship.  Nobody feels like challenging him on this.  He orders the first officer thrown into the brig, not taken to medbay.  The brig, where he will likely bleed out pretty soon.\n\nPolitical officer sends the chief of security, chief engineer (me), science officer, and few security goons down to the asteroid.  He makes it very clear he's listening through our coms and watching us very closely.  We beam down into small room with a door on either side.  One is open and leads to the cavity which is filled with black goo all over the walls, floor, and ceiling.  That's the life we detected.  The other door is large and heavy, but unlocked.  It leads to a small room lined with lockers and cabinets on the walls and a large server bank in the center.  We explore the room, going around either side of the servers.\n\nImmediately we are ambushed by a heavily armed squad of soldiers.  Security chief stabs one with her dagger.  Another one fires at my group with what appears to be a flame thrower that shoots plasma.  His weapon malfunctions.  The tank on his back makes a whining noise as I dive behind the servers for cover.  The bad guys hadn't had time to spread out yet and the explosion kills all but three of them and gives the rest a nasty sunburn.  The next soldier pulls out a grenade and tries to toss it over to our side of the servers.  It hits the edge and bounces back to her feet.  THAT explosion kills the rest of them.\n\nWhile that fight is going on, the ship loses contact with the away team.  They get bits and pieces of audio that suggest a fight.  Political officer panics and hails the research station.  \"Attention, station, remove all personnel from the asteroid or be destroyed!\"  A confused and worried looking man comes up on the screen.  \"Hey what?!  Who are you?  What is this?\"\n\n\"Order all personnel on the asteroid to evacuate now, or we will fire upon you.\"\n\n\"WHAT? WHAT'S GOING ON? WHY?\"\n\n\"You heard me!  Get your people off the asteroid, or we'll destroy you!\"\n\n\"WOAH!  WE'RE JUST FARMERS AND SCIENTISTS MAN!  DON'T SHOOT!\"  The man is full on freaking out.\n\nSensing this guy is not getting the picture, Political officer has Conn fire a warning shot.  A laser shoots out and swings across, cutting off a small piece of the station.\n\nInside the server room, charred bodies laying all over the floor, we hear on the intercom, \"JESUS! GET OUT OF THERE!  THERE'S A SCARY GUY HERE IN A SHIP SAYING HE'S GOING TO BLOW US ALL UP IF YOU DON'T LEAVE!  GET OUT! GO!\"  Anyway, I decide to set up a transmitter and back up all the data on the server to the ship.  That's when we found out that this room was shielded and we couldn't contact the ship.  This was the dead zone in our scans earlier.  The upload won't work here so I figure we got the door open, why not just set up a relay to the room outside that isn't shielded?  That works like a charm and in a few minutes we have all the data uploaded to the ship.\n\nJust as I'm about to suggest that we search the room as well in case there's something else we missed, I lose contact with the ship again.  That rat bastard political officer warped away without us as soon as the upload was complete!  Fewer people to poke holes in his account of events I suppose.  It doesn't take him long to figure out that he left behind the only guy on the crew who might be able to fix the universe-hoping device, me, and the only officer who was kind of on his side to begin with, the chief of security.  Oops.  While the away team is standing on this deserted asteroid trying to find a way to get to the station, he comes crawling back.  He lets us back on the ship with one threatening message, \"Your cooperation is expected.\"  Yeah, you haven't made any friends here buddy.\n\nSo now we're cruising around space, trying to figure out what to do.  I'm looking at the UHD and it looks like there's nothing I can do to fix it.  Then Khan comes to me.  \"Lieutenant Commander!  I have been analyzing the UHD while you were gone and I may have a way to configure the ship's transporter as a work around!  Unfortunately, I can only send one person and it will damage the ship's power generators in the process.\"  Well that's something I guess.\n\nI take a look at the data we got in the meantime.  It's all useless agricultural data.  Research to do with terraforming planets and setting up remote colonies  Absolutely nothing to do with genesis' potential uses as a weapon.  Son of a bitch, I knew we should have kept looking.  Political officer hails me.\n\n\"Do we have everything we need?\"\n\nI'm not sure why I did this next thing, maybe out of spite, maybe I hated this guy and wanted to get him in deep trouble with high command.  I forgot that in the military, shit rolls downhill.  \"Yep, we got it Commander.  Mission complete!\"\n\n\"Alright, I'm coming down. I want you to show me.\"  Conniving, paranoid bastard.\n\nOur new maniac of a captain is on his way.  I turn to Khan. \"Khan, you know that solution with the transporter?  I need you to do it now, beam me back home!\"\n\n\"But we need the data?  To save humanity from the Romulans!\"\n\n\"I have it right here!  I backed it up on my tricorder.  We have to hurry.  Humanity is in danger and this data is the only thing that can save them!\"  Lying through my teeth knowing that when the political officer gets down here, I'm dead.\n\nLuckily he bought it.  The lights go out on the ship as the Chief Engineer disappears.  I find my self on a planet nearby in the mirror universe while the rest of the crew drifts through space in a dead ship.\n\n(FYI, since you weren't there it may sound like the Political Officer's player was being a huge dick the whole time.  He really wasn't though.  Everyone was having fun, it was all in line with the kind of tone the GM was going for in this game.  The GM even said when we started that the Terran Empire isn't the optimistic future the Federation is and he encouraged us to be as cutthroat as we liked.)",

        "text": "Context: My friend and I have developed a homebrew system optimized for sci-fi settings with an emphasis on combat. What transpires are the events of the last (roughly) 2 sessions of our second beta campaign. As an aside, if anyone is interested in helping us beta test this game, I can set you up with rulebooks and a one-off!\n\nThe characters of note are: Doc, the alcoholic miracle medic; Collin, the sniper with a chip on his shoulder; and Mercier, the face-changing mutant.\n\nTo tell this story proper I have to rewind a bit. We tried to rob a casino. While we were scoping the place out, some *other* group decided to rob the *same* casino, using a kidnapped technomancer to open the vault. Well we weren't going to have any of that, so we started a firefight. After a brief running battle we killed all the robbers (the loot was destroyed though) and \"recruited\" the technomancer to our cause. He told us about the place where he had been \"manufactured\" (poor kid had some emotional problems), a place where he \"could see ... *everything*.\" Naturally, when our employer asked us to go there and retrieve a sample, we told him ~~where to stuff it~~ that we would be happy to.\n\nWe arrive. We approach. We blow up some stuff. We get to the complex.\n\nWe're driving around the complex, noting the various entrances and autoturrets trying to shoot us from afar, and the giant radio-antenna-like structure situated a short distance from the main building. After circling the building a couple more times and disabling turrets, Doc remembers something:\n\n\"Hey uh, guys? You remember the kid back on our ship? Didn't he say something about being able to see *everything* from here?\"\n\n\"Yeah, what about it?\"\n\n\"Well, kid's a technomancer. That there looks like a transmitter. Now it seems to me that a talented technomancer with a powerful transmitter could access any computer on this planet.\"\n\n\"Okay, and?\"\n\n\"Well, doesn't our ship have a computer? And a lot of guns? And our only way off this planet?\"\n\n\"Yeah -- Oh, shit.\"\n\nNew plan: Destroy the transmitter before our own ship comes shooting at us. Some daring maneuvers in our armored pickup later and we've dropped a high-powered explosive charge at the base of the radio tower, driven away, and pulled the detonator.\n\nNow. At this point, the DM looks at us, looks at his notes, looks at the game board, looks back at us. We're starting to get that crawling sensation on our neck; you know, the one that says \"We shouldn't have done that.\" Then the DM shrugs and describes - with a barely suppressed grin - the gradual collapse of the transmission tower.\n\nBack in the game, Doc, Collin, and Mercier have finished disabling all the external turrets, and then decided to walk into the front door (who's turrets have been offline the longest). We encounter a computer which promptly overloads (frying an NPC), monitors filled with the face of a middle-aged man screaming at us to leave, and none-too-friendly robots. The whole facility is trashed. There are corpses all over the place. Eventually we enter an office. Inside is the middle-aged man, who identifies himself as Dr. Cross and proceeds to try his damnedest to kill us. A few lucky rolls, we take him down. As he lies in a pool of bodily fluids, we approach, and he begins the exposition: he is the director of the facility, he has implants (hence the control by an apparently immature intellect). And then:\n\n\"...stop... Subject 11. Too strong... controlling the other... children. 11's power... exponential growth...\"\n\n\"How do we stop him, Dr. Cross?\"\n\n\"Use... the switch. Behind the desk... EMP...\"\n\nThat sinking feeling comes back.\n\n\"EMP? Uhh...\"\n\n\"Fires... energy pulse from... transmission tower...\"\n\n\"Transmission tower? That big one that looks like a radio antenna or something?\"\n\n\"...yes...\"\n\nYep. Definitely a sinking feeling.\n\n\"We uh... we kinda sorta... blew it up.\"\n\n\"You...uhhhhhh...\"\n\nAnd with that, Dr. Cross was dead. Almost immediately we started to feel heavy rounds hitting the building. A glance outside indicated that our ship was shooting at us.\n\nBy the time the battle was over, Collin was dead, and Doc had been forced to splatter half a dozen little kids, including one bound to a medical gurney, across the hood of the pickup. He promptly retired as a PC.",

        "text": "Ok So. I run a D&amp;D 5e game. One of the players wants to run a game, I trying -to expand my player’s RPG experience with different GMs- say yes. \nSo he offers forward an interesting writing prompt.\n“Make a superhero.”\nAs a former comic addict I am in my element here, I have dozens of different character concepts running through my head.\nSo I ask: “Ok, so what kind of setting is this?”\n   “Normal setting.” Is the reply. \n“Like golden age? Iron age?” Blank looks. \nThat’s ok, people aren’t necessarily familiar with these.\n“Ok like Grim dark? Four colour?” Which I realise is more jargon but it elicits the response: “Don’t worry about it, it will be fine.”\nThis raises a worry flag with me, but he says he has DM’ed before and is really eager to do this.\nSo, the day after I message him my character. A green lantern type character, I’m assuming starting out so I can fly, make shields, basic telekinesis and force blasts. The twist is, he was a scientist in a lab accident that caused a rift to another dimension to open inside him. He can pull energy from it to power his abilities, but if he takes too much he might lose control and people get hurt. I loved this concept I am one-hundred-percent invested in this character already. \n“So this is like in Everyday city sort of place?” I ask the new GM\n“Yeah sure, don’t worry. Trust me.”\n“What about technology level and themes?”\n“It’ll be fine, trust me.”\n\nI didn’t see that warning sign. So without any further information I submit my character. Taika Hiroku, born of immigrant parents in the US his genius was restricted by his family’s poverty, but he manages to get into university and excels meeting the Elon Musks, Jeff Basos etc. They make a company with revolutionary designs set to change the world. But due to a family medical issue he has to drop out, sell his shares in this promising company to ensure his mother has a comfortable life. Fixated even more on his own research, he sets up a lab and Boom. Superhero origin. \nI love this, I had dependants and possible story vectors in the rich geniuses that went on to achieve what he could not. He had emotional hot spots to be pushed for drama and he had a liability that forced him to handle semi-illegal drugs to maintain control over his sort-of out of control power. \n\nOk so nothing for a week, then a month. Then during a game he brings it up again, asking the others do make their characters. It seems I am the only one.\n“Yeah your character (me) caused me some problems especially since you’re in Japan.”\nWait what?\n“Wait what? Is your campaign set in Japan?” I ask\n“No, but you’re Japanese.” He replies.\n“I guess… That’s true.”\n“So you’re in Japan. Trust me it’ll be fine.”\n The other characters are created. Then the changes came.\n“You can’t be a super genius. You’re just starting out so you can’t be a super genius…”\nI can think of 3 superheroes off the top of my head that are super geniuses at the start of their career.\n“Ok, but The super genius thing is kind of integral to his origin and how he controls his powers.”\n   “You’re an astronaut.”\n“What?”\n“Yeah, you’re an astronaut, maybe an engineer, but you’re an astronaut.”\n “An Astronaut? I kind of envisioned my character to be in his early twenties…”\n  “Yeah but you were an astronaut.”\n   “But… average age is like 36 or so,”\n   “It’s fine, don’t worry.”\n   “And they’re mostly from the military…”\n“But you weren’t. You’re an astronaut. It’s fine don’t worry.”\nBut I did worry.\n\n“Ok you can’t have flight.” He says a week later. “You can get it later. I’ve made up a whole level up system and you can get it later, but you can’t have it at the start.”\n“So I’m just running around making shields, telekinesis and shooting force blasts….?”\n“Yeah and your shields will just be a bonus to your AC.”\n“But I had designed him to be crowd control. They were ablative… and I took damage but they were designed to control the battlefield…”\n   “Yeah, no, Maybe later. So now you just have a bonus to AC.”\n“Oh. ok.” I was not okay. \nSo a few days to game day, I was not happy I had designed green lantern and ended up with Cyclops. \n   “OK, so you don’t shoot energy blasts. You have Space Karate. You can like punch people using space karate.”\nAnd full on morose acceptance sets in. \n   “And your telekinesis will be like Mage hand, so no more than ten pounds. You start off weak and as you progress in levels you get more powerful. Trust me it’ll be fine.”\nI should have said this goes against the aesthetic of the superhero genre. Superman doesn’t get stronger over time. Batman doesn’t get to hit more people after defeating a boss. Superheroes are almost always completely trapped in time. A single unchanging point. \nI should have told him this was not my character any more.\nBut Morose Acceptance put it’s numbing pawl over everything.\n“Space Karate, Sure.” I said instead.\n\nGame day comes around. He’s made custom character sheets with personalised level up tables. He’s also just reskinned D&amp;D. I look at my 1d4 Space Karate strike and sigh.\n   “You know Dungeons and dragons isn’t really a good fit for superheroes.”\nHe agrees. “But there isn’t a better system really.”\nThe Morose acceptance is momentarily burned away by white hot nerd fury.\n   “Mutants and Masterminds, Fate variations, One roll engine Godlike or Wild Talents….” Take a breath. “...Marvel superheroes roleplaying game, Gurps Supers, Golden heroes and Champions.” (Ok, maybe champions isn’t the best system but my point still stands.)\n   “Don’t worry it’ll be fine.” He says. “We’re all familiar with D&amp;D so it’ll be easy.”\n“Can I change my character to a 1st level wizard instead?” I ask as the salt sets in. \n   “Do you want to?”\n The answer is unequivocally. “Yes.” It would have more abilities and almost 3 times the damage output and so much more utility.\n“We’ll do it this way for now and see how it goes. Trust me…”\nOk fine; whatever. The gm wants to run a superhero game without being familiar with superheroes or superhero games. \n\nThe game starts. He wants us to do individual introductions. Not my personal roleplaying choice, but I can see how it can be good. Lucky me I go first. I’m in the space station being an astronaut. Space station explodes, That is the extent of being an astronaut. I land on earth with new powers, so wonderful not even the lab accident origin remains, but I’m still reliant on specialist drugs to control my power.\n   “Wait, if I’m not a super genius, how do I know which medicine controls my powers. Is this a common thing?”\n   “No, you just tried each prescription until you found the right one…”\n   “That’s… that’s not how prescriptions work…”\nOK so i buy my pills.\n   “Pills? I had assumed it was some injected glowing glue liquid… Pills would be terrible for that… You know like Adrenalin pills would be bad for someone in Anaphylactic shock…”\n   “Don’t worry you take your prescription. And step out into Tokyo.”\nOh wonderful. I’m still living in Japan. \n   “I don’t have Japanese as a language I can speak…” I said looking at my sheet. \nFor a brief worrying moment I thought he was going to say ‘no it’s fine, you don’t know Japanese…”\nBut it turns out it was just a mistake. I know Japanese. Phew.\nSo I leave the chemist where I picked up my illegal drugs to control my potentially devastating power (Of space Karate). And I’m walking back to my place.\nWell I guess that makes sense Tokyo is very built up and has a good metro system. So sure I’m walking home. \nWhen a car drive up to me. Filled with Yakuza.\nOk….\n   “Hey you!” One of them say\nI say: “Ok, I’ll duck into an underground station.”\n   “There is no underground station.”\n   “Ok, I’ll duck into a shop.”\n   “There are no shops. You’re on a dirt road with fields around you.”\n“In Tokyo?” I say stunned. \nI haven’t been to Tokyo. But I never pictured it having fields and dirt roads. \nThe Yakuza get out of the car, five of them surround me. One pulls out a knife. \n   “Give me your wallet and phone.”\nFive of them. And here’s me with space Karate once per round for 1d4 damage. I can see this is supposed to be a hero moment, but by this point I have dug my heels in and made up my mind to play my character as I intended. Being afraid of his powers and not wanting to use it unless there is no choice. \n   “Give us your wallet and phone.” The Yakuza demand.\nSo I try something else. “I know your Oyabun.” I lie, “He would be annoyed if robbed me.”\nA deception check is called and I roll a 16 on the die and +3 on my modifier. So for a first level skill check in D&amp;D A respectable 18. \nNo roll, just a straight: “He doesn’t believe you and demands your things.”\nSo my metagame brain tells me Id4 a round, there are five of them I have an AC of 11, 13 if I can activate my shield. Even if they have 1 hit point, It would take me five rounds Taking a minimum of 14 damage. 14 damage from my 12 hit points at level 1, clearly I can’t beat them. \nMy roleplay brain tells me, Your character is a hero. He does not want to hurt them, the stakes are very low. He would just give up his cards and Phone. This is modern day (I assume, because it was never made clear) He would feel he can cancel the cards and get a new phone. It is a no brainer. \n   “Ok, I give them the wallet and phone.” \nThey take it, leave with a rude epithet, my character returns home and The GM reveals I have lost all my money and I don’t have a backup phone. \nBut a mysterious stranger has left me an invitation with the lure of money. I really wanted to say my character has more morals than becoming a mercenary, but no, despite what people say rule 1 is, it’s actually the agreement you want to play the game with other players. \n“I accept the invitation.”\nI’m not having fun at this point, My character has been eviscerated and mangled into this Space Karate travesty. But I was still being a player that engages in the plot. Then the other players have their origins to play out and then the saltiness level of over 9000 blasts in like a Super Saiyan of discontent.\nThere are, 2 super scientists on the team. Both of whom can fly. Everyone does more damage and can do more. One of the Super scientists has 3 drones that do different things! The other super scientist is strong enough to pick up a car. \nWell, sure that’s impressive, but can he pick up the car keys? The answer is yes. Yes he can. He can pick up more than 10 pounds of weight.\n\nThe saltiness was unstoppable as I make it known during the game. It’s not my proudest moment, had I been the GM I would have asked me to leave. But push on I did \n   “SO I wanted to be a super scientist.” I tell the group. “That can fly and pick up heavy objects. But I was told I couldn’t and here you are, you super scientist duo, you.” \n  “Well, maybe you made it after us.” One of the players ask.\n  “No,” Another points out, “He (Me) was first by a month.”\nThe GM admits he did not infact read my character. Forget 9000, I’m over 18000 levels of displeasure… but the game continued on with me being an aggressive sarcastic jerk. \n\nI did not like the way it played out. I was a very bad player. I should have suffered in silence and spoken to the GM privately. I should have just walked away. I apologised to the GM afterwards and promised it wouldn’t happen again. \n\nBut... He has said he wants to run another game and I am unsure if I want to even attempt it.\n\n",

        "text": "This is the story of currently three students attending a highschool in Neo Toronto called Bravo Academy, a specially designed facility to help superpowered Novahuman teens control their powers as well as get a good education.\n\n[Previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/7zhkld/mutants_and_masterminds_3e_bravo_academy_part_2/), students Alistair and Kayla had a long talk with Agent Halo, a teacher at the school regarding their previous run in with Iron Bandit. After being patched up by the nurse bot and allowed to rest for a period of time, Halo shows them to their rooms and they meet Sean, the third member of this group. After hanging out and relaxing for the rest of the day, the three go to homeroom, meet some of their fellow students and after a tour of the school go to the Danger Room, where they have a 3 on 2 battle with resident douche canoe Gar Malton and his much more tolerable buddy Freddy Mars.\n\nPlayers were awarded one Power Point for their efforts, and at the start of the third session, their Hero Points reset to 1 each.\n\n*Thus, we move onto our next adventure:*\n\nAfter a few days of getting used to the school, the first weekend comes up and Kayla makes good on a previous promise to show the group around Neo Toronto, the city in which Bravo Academy is found.\n\nToronto was flattened over a decade prior to the events of our tale, with such destruction that the new city, which was rebuilt in record time thanks to helpful Novahumans had become the most technologically advanced city in the world. This also lead what might have been familiar landmarks to look different or be located elsewhere, and the general layout of major roads and districts to be unfamiliar to those who might call Toronto their home now.\n\nThe group were eating at one of the few small local pizza joints, Mama June’s Pizza Parlour in the Commercial District of the City (located in and around Spadina for those who are familiar with IRL Toronto). As the district got closer to Downtown, the buildings got much bigger, and to accommodate for the traffic the district had high-rise roadways, much like the ones you’d see in Dragonball’s West City.\n\nMama June’s did well enough to stay in the cluster of larger chain restaurants and other major businesses. It was a smaller locale with some booths and tables, and a single, small kitchen. Standing behind the register is a teen girl who clearly wants to be elsewhere while the portly male chef works on a new order. The group discuss what to do with their day and enjoy their various pizzas.\n\nAs they eat, a breaking news broadcast comes on the TV saying that local heroes in Neo Toronto are fighting a powerful supervillain called Grav Master in the Business District of the city, and citizens are advised to steer clear. Given the state of the world, most of the patrons, Kayla included go back to what they were doing, as due to the city and its history, as well as the increased Novahuman population, the citizens of Neo Toronto were almost used to Supervillain attacks, though were still as scared or as tense as anyone if they were close by.\n\nThere was a brief discussion as to whether the group should help out, but it was put to one side as the more experienced heroes were already on the case, though the option to go and watch the chaos live was floated as the group paid their tab and left the place satisfied with their meal. \n\nIt was during their wanderings in the city that the group spy a young woman who is talking with a couple of police officers. Listening in, they overhear that the woman had her purse stolen by a mechanical spider, something the size of a dog. With the majority of the city’s heroes and emergency workers tending to the situation elsewhere in the city, the group decides to investigate the matter themselves. Asking around and scouting, the group gather further information, gaining more details about the spider, such as how fast they were and how shoddily it seemed to be built (I believe the term was “looks like Mechano”).\n\nSean’s speed allows him to scout the entire city within minutes, finding a maintenance tunnel entrance near the Business District. The three arrive and head inside, descending into a dark hallway, lit only by their phones. Eventually, the group come across a set of double doors, with a sign above them which has “KEEP OUT” crudely written on it.\n\nAlistair, clearly sensing no suspicion at all, gracefully opens the door with an Air Cannon, forcing the steel panels off their hinges and launching them across the room beyond them.\n\nThe room was fairly sizable, being a largely open space where mechanical pods, each of which containing some of these mechano spiders were haphazardly strewn about. As the group enter, a TV screen near the ceiling at the opposite end of the room comes to life, showing the image of a kid in a scientist’s outfit, almost looking like a kid version of Dr Insano. The kid, proclaiming himself to be ‘Dr. Irresponsible’ warns the three that they have entered his lair, and invites them to continue, if they dare. At this point, the spiders in the pods come to life and attack the trio.\n\nSean’s speed and Alistair’s ranged assault clear up most of the spiders with very little issue, and in the process Kayla possesses a cluster of the things, gaining a trio of spider pets, one of whom rolls exceptionally well, being dubbed Lucky.\n\nNow properly outfitted, Alistair bowls down the next set of doors, and groans in frustration when he sees another set at the end of the following corridor, which he also destroys.\n\nThe room beyond appears to be a workspace, with several desks for computers, chemistry sets and work desks with robotics and other things can be found relatively easily enough. On one desk, with a small sign above it saying ‘Loot’ is a purse, some loose change and a half empty box of booster packs for the trading card game Waifu Battle.\n\nAnother TV screen comes on, and it continues to monologue, despite the attempted interruptions  from Alistair, leading the group to realise the screens have been pre-recorded. Dr. Irresponsible explains that the heroes have made it far, but now they must trade blows with his prized creation, Bolt-Fu. A nearby wall panel opens up, and out marches a humanoid robot, connected to the wall with a power cable.\n\nWhile Alistair tangled with Bolt-Fu, Sean speeds ahead to the next room. Inside he meets the villain in question, in a long room behind a protective screen and a desk.\n\n“So you have defeated Bolt-Fu, but now you must defeat... Doctor Irresp-...I’m sorry, who are you?”\n\nThe good doctor says he was very much expecting actual heroes, to which Sean says that being a D-Tier villain, heroes in training were to be expected. Meanwhile, Bolt-Fu puts up a respectable fight by seemingly using legit martial arts until Kayla orders Lucky to use its concussive laser to disconnect the robot from the wall and shut it down. \n\nSuitably victorious, the group begin to open up a standard hero/villain dialogue with Dr. Irresponsible, only for the theatrics to be interrupted rather quickly by the sounds of rumbling nearby. It suddenly dawns on them that this little hideout was near the site of the real Supervillain encounter, and decide it would be best for all involved to book it as quickly as possible. Grabbing the goods and the villain (after Kayla opens the screen Dr. Irresponsible was hiding behind.) they make their way back to the entrance, only to be greeted with a cloud of dust filling the original corridor, with a silhouette inside it.\n\n“I came to find a refuge from my pursuers, and yet my prospective hideout is filled with... children.”\n\nGrav Master had the appearance similar to Magneto, just with a bit more armour, a black, clean-cut beard and blue and blacks in colour as opposed to purples. Of course, his feet never touched the floor. \n\nAs the villain floated into the room, the group were confronted with a new situation; unlike Iron Bandit, this fight was in an enclosed space, and no one knew the group would be here. There was also the factor that, while Iron Bandit was scary in her own right, on the face of it her skill set was primarily her ability to use a firearm well. Grav Master, as the name implied, had control over one of the fundamental forces of the universe.\n\nThe fight that follows is brutal, as Grav Master is able to withstand a large amount of the damage that the group put out, as well as deal it with his own Area of Effect abilities, reducing the gravity in one place and increasing it in another with crushing results. \n\nAlistair’s brute force does knock Grav Master around and Sean’s speed and Kayla’s spiders keep him from suffering too much from the villain’s hazardous effects, but it’s clear to the trio that this fight is not in their favour. As such, as Kayla finds a corner to hide in, she hacks into whatever communication network she can find and puts out an SOS.\n\nNow filled with the need to keep the villain here, the group shift gears and do their best to survive the situation. Lucky, the PL5 mechano spider even lands a hit or two on Grav Master, though other spiders are lost in the fray. As Grav Master winds up for another assault, he is intercepted by a streak of lightning, narrowly avoiding an attack from a female superhero that enters the combat.\n\nEntering the combat is Voltaic Vanguard, the world’s premiere Superhero, who was first to answer the group’s APB. She wears an aerodynamic battle armour of blues and golds, and is a little heavier set than most would expect of the standard hero, but is constantly surrounded by pulses of electricity. Now reinvigorated, the players team up with Vanguard in the fight to defeat Grav Master.\n\nWhile Grav Master continues to put up a good fight, a series of powerful hits puts him down for the count, with Sean first landing a running knee, followed by an Air Launcher from Alistair straight down. As the villain hits the floor, Kayla overloads one of the nearby devices in the room to cause an electrical explosion, which Voltaic Vanguard focuses using her powers.\n\nAs the fight ends, local law enforcement follows Hunter onto the scene, and Voltaic Vanguard cheerfully gives Hunter the run down on what’s about to happen; she’s going to run Grav Master into custody while he’s going to get the group some appropriate medical care.\n\nThe group are brought back to school, once again finding themselves in the nurse’s office, only this time with the company of Voltaic Vanguard, who decided to come and have a talk with the group. While the group expect her to talk down to them about the dangers of playing hero, Voltaic Vanguard actually congratulates them on a job well done, and has a pleasant talk with them about their efforts and making sure to not bite off more than they can chew. She gives the group a hug before being called off to deal with something in Ghana by Legend.\n\nThe session ends with the group freaking out over meeting and helping the world’s greatest hero.\n\nThis session was a lot more challenging than first anticipated. Grav Master held a lot more potential than envisioned, able to not only hold his own against a group of three players, but do more so than Iron Bandit did at the start of the game. Even when Voltaic Vanguard arrived for the assist, Grav Master was holding out for a lot more than I honestly expected (which helped, because I feel the encounter wouldn’t have been as well received if an NPC came in to ultimately save the day.)\n\nWe’ll just have to wait and see what happens next.\n",

        "text": "The accompanying comic lives **[over here](http://www.handbookofheroes.com/archives/comic/race-to-the-finish)**, but here be my tale. Ahem: \n\nPlayers do not like it when you take away their stuff. They earned that stuff. It’s theirs, dammit! And if you so much as threaten said stuff you’re going to get smote. I learned this the hard way. \n\nMy players found themselves on a mysterious tropical island, having taken a magical portal from the dungeon to the far side of the world. They spent weeks fighting intelligent apes, cthuloid horrors, and the mandatory crew of rum-besotted pirates. It goes without saying that they managed to accumulate mass quantities of booty in the process. There were ingots and rolled tapestries; bejeweled flagons and feathered masks; solid gold idols and silver ewers and way, way too much stuff to schlep around on a dangerous island. So they buried it.\n\nFlash forward to the end of the adventure. They’re sailing around the headlands towards the beach, eager to collect their stuff and head home, when they notice a golden glittering upon the sand. Their cache has been pillaged! The party’s precious treasure is lying exposed all along the shore. And clinging to a nearby cliff, bedraggled and miserable, is the sorry remainder of the pirate crew. A T-rex and her offspring had treed the pirates mid-pillage, and are now waiting down below for pirates to drop into their mouths.\n\nYou have never seen Good characters turn Neutral so fast. Half of them begin casting spells and knocking down pirates while the other half ferry the treasure to the raft. Pirates are eaten by the score, the baby dino chases the poor sorcerer around like a cat with a laser pointer, and a small armada of summoned spirits teleport gold like some kind of celestial moving company.\n\nAt last they’ve got the boat loaded up and ready to go. And so, disturbed by their bloodthirstiness but impressed with their ingenuity, I make the mistake of allowing them to narrate the exciting conclusion of the encounter.\n\n“Alright,” say I. “You manage to load the last chest onto your raft. But just as you push off, Chester the Tyrannosaur bites down on the gunwale of your boat. So I want you to tell me how you manage to–”\n\n“What do you mean it bites the boat?” explodes the bard.\n\n“It’s not even its turn!” says the sorcerer.\n\n“So what, we just get skipped while you steal our stuff?” demands the oracle.\n\n“Well no,” I stammer. “I mean yes, it bit the boat, but….” I could feel mutiny brimming beneath the surface. The light of righteous indignation burned within my players’ eyes. And if Chester hadn’t released the boat tout de suite, I believe my bones would still lie buried upon that island.\n\nSo here’s my advice to all you GMs out there. If you’re going to throw thieves, rust monsters, or a rival adventuring party at your players, you can rest assured that they will be properly motivated. Just make sure that, in the event that they do lose their stuff, you’ve got a flash grenade or an ejector seat or some kind of handy distraction. Because players love their stuff, and no one is getting in their way.",

        "text": "So I was playing through the final mission while bearing with a team that didn't understand the definition of \"team\" and all wanted to run off and do their own things. Surprisingly, we made it to the final boss.\n\nI was playing as Saltzpyre using his \"Zealot\" class and noticed that I was continually being hit and receiving the buff that would prevent me from dying to a lethal hit (can't recall the name of the buff). This continued to happen and it appeared to me that it may be some sort of bug, however I felt it was somewhat of a reward for dealing with the lackluster team. It got to a point where I was the only member of the team left standing, with only a sliver of health, and constantly having to revive downed team mates while occasionally throwing strikes at the boss.\n\nThe final boss, to me at least, was an absolute pain in the ass in addition to my team.\n\nMy team and I managed to get the boss to approximately 1/4 health and I quickly ran over to a team mate that had been knocked down. As I begin to revive poor Bardin, suddenly I experience blackness, followed by a small white box on my desktop screen telling me the game had crashed.\n\nThe pain of dealing with a pain in the ass boss and lackluster team in addition to a game crash near the end of the final level made me want to punch through my computer screen. No reward, no experience gain, my efforts were for nothing.\n\nMy anger subsided with the resurgence of Vermintide 1 memories as I recalled that Vermintide 1 gave you absolutely nothing for failing a mission, if you were disconnected or if you experienced one of the game's many crashes.\n\nAfter approximately 12 hours of play, this is the first crash I have experienced with Vermintide 2 and the first time I have not received any sort of reward for \"failing\" a mission.\n\nDespite the above, Vermintide 2 is a much more polished and improved experience than Vermintide 1 and satisfies that urge to play something that doesn't require a whole lot of thought. As long as you are paired up with a decent team, prepare for a lot of Skaven and Chaos slaying madness.\n\nIn the end, if you do pick up Vermintide 2, prepare for the odd bug and please, don't be a shit team mate.",

        "text": "&gt; As Rickart the gnome cleans Nez the dragonborn's wounds, he dislodges a pellet fired by the kobolds. \"This is goning to leave a nice scar.  Ladies love scars. Here, have a souvenir.\" Nez's gratitude is palpable, but he is taciturn - ashamed of his 'episode' causing such danger to his colleagues.  The tiefling Alice polishes her blade is silence, and Nez listens to the pellet, hoping for answers.\n\nThe amount of damage sustained by Nez in the last session dictated some permanent physical change, so now he has a dueling scar. \n\n&gt; As the party approaches Greenest, they see columns of black smoke - the town is under siege. Closer still, and they can make out the distant silhouette of a large creature circling the town's central keep... a dragon.\n\nSeems early to face a dragon.  A small amount of legitimate fear from the players here.\n\n&gt; The party moves towards town as stealthily as they can, entering the surrounding residential area just outside the town proper.  Nez hears some commotion in a nearby house, and discerns that there is someone restrained and gagged inside - several someones.\n&gt; Rickard slides around to the front to see about a door.  He does... but also clocks 6 kobolds, laughing as they sort through the home's meager possessions.  Unseen, he slides back to his party to inform them of the imminent situation.\n\nThe DM rolled some D6s to define the parameters of this situation, and double sixes gave him six kobolds for us to fight, and six villagers to rescue.  \n\n&gt; Alice slips around the back and finds a window, confirming the tied bundles in the corner - a family of six, including a baby.  She holds at the window, watching the door. Nez holds while Rickart slides back around to try and sneak inside.  He slowly established the door is free to open and not noisy, and pushes gently.  In doing so, he sets off a crossbow trap which narrowly misses his head, but alerts the kobolds.  \n\nThe rogue forgot to check for traps.  That's me, by the way.  Ouch.\n\n&gt; Rickart jumps through the door and slams it shut, pulling a heavy table over to block the door.\n\nMy strength roll gave me 'mum's baby trapped under a car' strength.\n\n&gt; Nez approaches the corner, and under cover begins whispering under his breath. The kobold in the center of the group clutches his head, blood trickles from his nose, and he collapses. Nez slides back around the corner and the kobolds don't know what hit them - but they move to action.  They split up - two going around the opposite side of the house to Nez, three coming to the front door.\n\nGetting that first kobold turned out to be a BIG deal, as the numbers were NOT in our favour.  6 v 3 is lopsided at best.\n\n&gt; Meanwhile, Rickart is attempting to free the tied prisoners.  He removes the gag and cuts the bonds of the first, a young man in his teens.  \"Son, I need your help to free these people.  Can you help?\" The young man responds listlessly, awash in panic, and makes a move to the back window where Alice begins to help him out. Rickart begins freeing the second prisoner as the kobolds advance.\n&gt; \"Sir, I...\" \n&gt;\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\"\n&gt; \"Calm down, we...\"\n&gt;\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\"\n\nMy persuasion rolls were... not good. \n\n&gt; The second man, terrorized and babbling, runs shrieking for the small window on the fourth side of the house,. and begins to climb out.  As he manages to get his head out of the window, he begins to spasm, and falls to the floor. His head remains outside.\n\nKobolds off the port bow!  \n\n&gt; A thudding begins at the door. Rickart pauses in his rescue efforts to respond, and waits with his rapier by the barred doorway.  The sturdy oaken table blocks the bottom half of the door, but three kobolds make short work of the upper half, and an arm reaches in.  The rapier slides under it, piercing the heart of the beast and it retreats instantly. Now they are two.\n\nCritical hits have a wonderful effect on the storytelling, and I love them for that reason.\n\n&gt; Alice gets the young man out of the window (perhaps using a bit more force than strictly necessary) and positions herself at the opposite corner awaiting danger from the side. Inside,  from the window pours a viscous liquid that begins to set fire to the straw and cloth on the floor - the danger has only increased.\n\nAs an aside, one of the kobolds who dumped the hot lamp oil in the window doused himself, and he died off camera.  It was a comically bad roll from the DM.\n\n&gt; Nez moves around to the rtear window in the hopes of helping with the kobold B&amp;E.  He aims an eldritch blast at the door, but it has little effect. Rickart frees prisoner number three, and older man, and feebly attempts to persuade him to help.  Despite the Gnome's ham-fisted request, he agrees and Rickart gives him a dagger.  He has clearly taken this home invasion very, very personally.\n&gt; Rickart assumes the man will help free the last prisoner, but he instead hands the gnome back his knife and strides purposefully to the door, as the kobolds smash through.\n\nAs one player put it, 'He's going to bare-knuckle them?'\n\n&gt; Behind the house, Alice had been readying for an attack that she knows is coming around the corner.  But she must stop to help the young man out of thwe window, and her annoyance is palpable.  She turns to him and scolds, 'Your life is in danger, your family needs you, why are you so useless?' At that moment, the kobold turns the corner and stabs her in the side.\n\nThe turn progression and rolls dictated this moment, which fit perfectly with the situation, and Alice's character.  \n\n&gt; She swings at the kobold, but glances off his pauldron, in a replay of her first kobold encounter.  Nez, seeing her in trouble, waves a feather in the air. The kobold, already cackling at his fortune, starts laughing uncontrollably. He doubles up, a small patch of urine runs down his leg, and he falls prone, helpless with mirth.  Alice holds his head with her boot before severing it.\n\nAnd THAT is why the Warlock loads up Hideous Laughter.\n\n&gt; Inside, Rickart watches as the man walks steadily to the bursting door.  in thier haste to enter, one kobold trips and impales himslef on the wreckage of the door, but his partner scrambles inside, only to meet the fierce swing of a monstrous uppercut.  The former prisoner's fist slides through the kobold like a hot knife, and the kobold's head is separated from his collapsing body.  Rickart lets out a shuddering breath, and quietly says, \"Do you need a job?\"\n\nTurns out this guy was an ex-adventruer - a barbarian - with some experience in battle.  Yay!\n\n&gt; Rickart frees the final prisoner (a mum and her baby), and they escape from the burning building by the rear window.  They meet Alice, Nez and the young man and move to the front of the house, where they see the door disintegrate as the final, impaled kobold flies bodily from the opening, followed by the implacable figure of the paternal head of this household. His expression does not change at any point during the preceding events.\n\nThe DM is considering making this guy a new NPC to travel with the party!  WOO HOO!",

She decided to try out her new fireball spell to sow some carnage and maybe do a good deed by culling some of the marauding hobgoblins. As a group, we descended to 150 feet and she let rip. \n\nShe rolled well and took out a fair number of hobgoblins. This is when the problems started. The range of fireball is 150 feet. The top range of a rock as thrown by a giant is 240 feet. The top range of a hobgoblin longbow is 600 feet.\n\n2 giant rocks and 33 arrows later and all our gryphons are dead and the party are plummeting to their deaths. A couple of us survived the fall with creative uses of shadow step and a feather fall. Then the giants got us, bad things happened and we wished the fall had gotten us.\n\nIf you want to hear more of my thoughts on bad decisions, here they are: http://jrkaneauthor.com/2018/01/15/the-beauty-of-bad-decisions/",

        "text": "Kind of a short story but funny. We had just made our way out of a forest contaminated with bullywugs and giant frogs to be stuck on a cliff ledge. About 200ft below us in a gorge we could see a small village and a monastery where we were supposed to meet with a monk about an ancient book. Our warlock Motgar and Ranger Amelia decide they are going to race down the cliff and to the monastery. The winner would get 20gp. So both of them immediately spring into action and being the dumbasses they were theyd completely forgotten they had rope and climbing gear and decided to boulder down 200ft roll their d20s Motgar rolls a nat 20 and Amelia rolls a 1 in athletics. Motgar boulders down completely fine, Amelia on the other hand... she trips off the edge of the cliff and plummets to her death. She hits the ground and is reduced to -18hp from her 50hp she then fails on all of her death saving throws. Luckily she had received a blessing from a goddess earlier in the campaign that gave her one revival if she were to die all she had to do was roll higher than the negative hp she was at. Amelia was at -18hp and needed to get a 19 or 20 to live. She manages to roll a 19 and returns to 1hp. Using all the energy she has left she yells “does this mean i win?” She then passes out waking up 12days later in the monastery.  ",
