        "text": "I was seeing lots of things about how some zoos can put to sleep their animals if they don’t want them and how lots of people were really upset about it like that baby giraffe that was put to sleep. But I never heard opinions why it happens from people who know. Like there must be a reason for it but all I see is lots of people saying how it’s a bad thing. why did the giraffe get put to sleep and why didnt they do something else and are there any more examples of this\n\nI heard that if an animal isnt good for breeding it is put to sleep but they use birth control pills like they do with humans. so why dont they do this for the giraffe?\n\nAnother question I have is why is keeping an animal that isn’t endangered in a zoo a good thing? Like I get why keeping endangered for breeding is good but what about elephants and giraffes\\?\n\nAnother question is do zoos do releases of animals when they breed them, Like when they breed there animals do the babies get released into the wild like they say they do?\n\nI’m sorry if these are dumb questions, please don't get mad if it looks like I'm hating on zoos",

        "text": "First off, I apologize if I'm in the wrong subreddit. Please point me in the right direction if I am.\n\nSome background: \nI'm doing my bachelor's in Visual Communications in Design, and for my final Capstone project, I’m addressing the problem that most available conservation resources go towards attractive, cute, or popular species, rather than those with the greatest benefit to the ecosystem (fungi, plants, and reptiles are often forgotten). Because of this selective conservation, ecosystems continue to move towards collapse due to unbalanced biodiversity.\n\nMy proposed solution is a video game that gamifies education and engagement in biology and ecology. The game will be a resource-management and environment-building style game, such as SimCity or Zoo Tycoon. When the player begins the game, they undertake an ecosystem with a poorly balanced environment and limited resources. The objective of the game is to restore this balance with the resources on hand and achieve ecosystem equilibrium through efficient species management. Or instead, if users choose, they can intentionally destroy the environment. Either way, they’ll learn what does and doesn’t work.\n\nSo, my questions are, would you find something like a useful engagement and education tool?\nWhat areas would I need to research to ensure my game is successful and reaches its intended market?\nWho would I need to collaborate with? \nAny other information or insight would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks for your time!",

I've seen and been a part of many conservation research programs which utilise CS to some degree. I'd have to say, sadly some are shallow attempts at spreading awareness and the data is usually the equivalent of useless stamp collecting which sits on some volunteer intern's laptop. But I have been involved with a few projects that have added greatly to research programs and has resulted in new papers, MPAs areas and stricter management regulations being implemented. Also with new technology such as drones and underwater cameras becoming much more mainstream, the ease of collecting data from the public is becoming much easier. So just wondering what programs have and haven't worked and why this is so and what you think the role is for CS going forward.",

        "text": "Two stories here, first one describes possible increased human-crocodile conflicts as the reptiles expand into new areas as their population rises.  Quote:\n\n&gt;Saltwater crocodile numbers in the Northern Territory fell to 2,000 to 3,000 during the early 1970s, but have since recovered to about 120,000.\n\nRead more: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4282730/Saltwater-crocodiles-rise-Western-Australia.html#ixzz4tYJwZY9e \nFollow us: @MailOnline on Twitter | DailyMail on Facebook\n\nQuestion:  Is there justification to cull the population, since in a smaller population it would be less likely for some individuals to expand to new territory (occupied by people)?\n\n* * * * * \n\nSecond story seems to present a highly problematic situation because one exceptionally large crocodile was killed.  Quote:\n\n&gt;The incident sparked warnings about heightened aggression among younger crocodiles in the wake of the giant predator's death.\n\nhttps://phys.org/news/2017-09-australian-police-killer-giant-crocodile.html\n\nConsidering a population of  100,000 crocodiles, isn't this one death statistically of no significance?  (story seems unduly alarmist).  Is it being posited that there is now a much greater risk of attack to people in the area where the large croc was killed?    Even though we know that 1) very large crocs are particularly prone to attack humans and 2) escape from a large croc is less likely than with a smaller animal.  Any other negative impacts of various moderate size crocs now jostling for dominance? *(the tenor of the story is very alarmist.)*\n\nAre there a significant animal protection or conservation factors in this topic?  *What if the large croc had died of old age--a certain eventuality.  Why would this natural event have less severe consequences that the creature being killed by man?*  Or is this story much ago about nothing?  Sincerely asking.\n\n*(In a not completely dissimilar situation, it has been shown that killing all the dominant elephants in an area means that young tuskers can turn to bad practices, such as killing rhinos.  Excerpt of a story:  \" The culprits turned out to be marauding bands of aggressive juvenile male elephants...were caught on camera chasing down the rhinos...goring them to death with their tusks. The juvenile elephants were terrorizing other animals in the park as well...Something had gone...wrong.\"  Seems the case of killing elephants is a far better example of the problematic consequences from removing dominant individual(s) from a population.)\n",

I had always considered zoology (specifically herpetology) but I fear I may not be cut out for the schooling required. Regardless, I think getting involved in  conservation would be a good start.\n\nI was hoping some of you here may actually work in conservation, or may have some insight on prospective fields or career advise on how to go about getting started.",

What is the best way to go about researching this? I am aiming to focus my paper on commercially important species, so that I can do a cost-benefit analysis of mangrove replanting and the benefits reforestation will have for the fishing community.\n\nI know some of the obvious ones, mud crabs, certain species of fish use them as a nursery, etc. Anyone have sources or sites that could help with this? My University's library search is not too great and my professor gave me some papers but they are almost all about mangroves in the world in general, or they don't get specific enough about the species present in Myanmar other than the one they study for their particular paper.\n\nThanks in advance! :)",

She went semi-vegetarian of her own choice (bacon was apparently a deal breaker), she asked that her family avoid palm oil to save orangutans, and she held a bake sale to raise money for orangutans. She is very in love with the outdoors, and her family takes her hiking and camping constantly.\n\nSadly, they moved out of state, but will be back for the holidays. She loves reading, and so I thought I might get her a book. Then again, I'm not sure what a gift for an animal loving kid might be.\n\nI would want it to be something upbeat, or at the very least not \"our planet is fucked\". She loves fiction (particularly Tolkien) so maybe even something in that realm that centers on conservation and the environment. She is educated that animals and their habitats are being destroyed, so it doesn't need to be sugarcoated, but I also don't want her to ever give up hope on her dreams.\n\nThanks in advance for any ideas!\n\nEDIT: She is 9, so please no curse words!",
