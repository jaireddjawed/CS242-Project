If the signal were a repeating signal in the form of a pulsing light alone, could it be programmed to communicate mathematical principles such as 2+2=4? \n\nOr perhaps another way of putting this: can such signals only be designed to be recognized (eg the aliens recognize our syntax for 2+2=4), or can they affirmatively teach?\n\nThe book that has sparked this question is “Children of Time” by Adrian Tchaikovsky. In it (no big spoilers) two insectoid species are able to understand mathematical problems beamed down from an orbiting satellite, and solve those problems. \n\nHere’s my best guess:\nOne beep (silence) binary for one\nTwo beeps (silence) binary for two\nBinary for one (binary for plus) binary for one (binary for equal) binary for two.\nEtc. \n\nHow could you communicate geometry with binary?",

        "text": "Here’s my basic understanding, correct me if any of this is wrong:\n•They are misfolded proteins that cause other normal proteins to misfold resulting in rapid progression of symptoms of brain disease until death. \n\n•They cannot be destroyed, only denatured and that can only be done with specific steps of cleaning that involves bleach and very high temperatures for a long period(s) of time. \n\n•All mammals have them in our bodies, but they only cause symptoms if they enter the brains and cause the misfolding of other prions there. \n\n•There is one type of prion, but every type of mammal has a different type of prion disease they can be affected by this one type of prion. The only example of interspecies infection has been BSE/vCJD. \n\n•Infections can be from an actual infectious material, genetic, or spontaneous. Onset of symptoms from time of infection can be decades or longer. Many people who have infectious prions in their bodies do not even know because they die before the disease shows symptoms or something in their genetics protects them from forming a prion disease. \n\n\n\n\nHowever, there’s a lot I don’t understand and there’s so much misinformation online and specifically on Reddit from non scientists who repeat the same surface misinformation they read without even having a modicum of scientific understanding or accuracy of what they’re saying and I’d like accurate answers from scientists to increase my understanding. \n\n\n\n\n\nSo here are my questions:\n\n1) I have read that science thinks the primary way of infection for humans is through ingestion or blood and it is not spread through other means like touch or inhalation (although a Swiss study I read from 2011 says it’s possible) . So even though in wildlife it can be passed on to other like wildlife by touch or other means, this doesn’t affect humans to humans. The medical and scientific community has said that those caring for people with a prion disease aren’t at risk of being infected unless they are handling materials that touched secretions from the brain, eyes, or spinal cord. \n\nOk, but how do we know it’s not spread through other means like touch, inhalation, saliva, coughing etc., esp if symptoms don’t occur for a decade or more. There has been a documented case of lab worker in France who was working on prions and tragically pricked herself. She died years later of a prion disease. I understand this was high risk work, but I cannot see much of a difference in infectivity between this example and someone who has an open cut on their hand and touches a surface that an infected person touched after touching their eyeballs. Prions last forever on surfaces. So am I wrong in not seeing a difference? If I’m not wrong, then what is to prevent a person from getting infected through touching of surfaces they do all day? \n\n\n2) we know about potential of infection via infectious meats, but the scientific community has said that ingesting animal milk poses no risk. How do they know that for sure? \n\n3) If a person known to have a prion disease has a surgery or other procedure where reusable medical equipment was used, there are specific cleaning or discarding protocols in place. But there are millions of medical procedures done, where presumably a person with a prion disease is operated on, but no one knows. And the procedure could be done in a facility with subpar cleaning protocols. The risks are much higher I presume for procedures that use equipment involving the brain, eyes, or spinal cord, but are there risks in this situation in getting a procedure done that goes into the digestive system like an endoscopy or colonoscopy? What about any procedure using medical equipment on any body part? \n\n4) as discussed, prions are notoriously extremely difficult to denature. As such, areas of environment with infected wildlife that had shed the prions through grazing, feces, urine, skin shedding can be rampant and never ending. Those same areas can be used to grow crops. What  are the risks and chances of being infected through eating of crops grown in an infected area? \n\n5) progressive diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s etc. are right now not said to be prion diseases, but like prion diseases. How do we know they are not actual prion diseases?  \n\n6) CWD is very prevalent in certain areas of the US. Right now there is said to be no risk of humans catching it from the mammals who are infected by it. But that could change. What can be done to mitigate this risk?",

Or did the writer miss a way that this would violate causality anyway?\n\nIf not, what are some of the practical properties this strange \"warp space\" would have for an observer? \n\nIf so, has anyone hypothesized any varieties of \"cosmic censor\" that would maintain causality in the presence of FTL?",

        "text": " \n\nHello,\n\nSo I am really fascinated by systems. Like, the concept of systems, how they work, etc.\n\nSo  like, I am equally fascinated by understanding the dynamics of a market  economy and how the immune system works and how an ant colony  self-organizes.\n\nPoint is, I have a  wide variety of interests across several different fields. And what I  realized is what fascinates me in all of them is understanding how  SYSTEMS as a general concept work. So I love understanding how the ant  colony functions, or how a market economy works, or how a computer  program works, particularly I love self-organization, and emergent  properties.\n\nI have studied these  systems in isolation, but I think the thing I should study are systems  as a whole, and that leads me to fields like cybernetics and systems theory.\n\nIs that  really the right field to study? Or is there a better way to study HOW  systems work, how self-organization and emergent properties work, cause  that's what i want to learn about.\n\nWhat are some good resources to learn about HOW systems work, not just what they are or their purpose.\n\nThanks!",

Is Solay System somewhat rare? Or its just a bias due to the difficulty to detect such a sparse planetary system?

        "text": "Recently I've listened to two different podcasts that have discussed experiments to revive cells after death. In these experiments there have been promising developments in reviving the function of a variety of different cells that have been dead for an hour or more.\n\nAs I understand it, right now these experiments seem to be focused on the potential for extending the window for how long organs remain viable for transplant - or potentially returning organs to viability.\n\nThe podcasts did not go deep into discussions about brain cells, but did suggest there has been some promise with reviving brain cells.\n\nThe possibility for brain cells has raised a number of questions in my mind. The main question has been whether the memories stored in the brain could survive this process of death and being revived. My understanding is memories are dependant on the electrochemical interactions between brain cells. This suggests that if brain function completely stopped and cells started to die, everything that involved memory would be lost, even if the individual cells were revived.\n\nIf memories were in fact lost, could the lower level functions of the brain - such a breathing - potentially be restarted? Potentially allowing the body to be the life support for the organs?\n\nIf memories could be maintained, does this raise the possibility of reviving people who died from things like drowning or loss of blood?\n\nSo many thoughts about where this could potentially go. Plus plenty of thoughts about ethics. Not just how such advances might be used, but how to handle the in between steps.",

Wake-activated neurons may be at increased risk of metabolic injury across sustained wakefulness.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Methods:** To examine the effects of ISS on wake-activated neurons and wake behavior, wild-type mice were randomized to ISS (a repeated pattern of short sleep on 3 consecutive days followed by 4 days of recovery sleep for 4 weeks) or rested control conditions. Subsets of both groups were allowed a recovery period consisting of 4-week unperturbed activity in home cages with littermates. Mice were examined for immediate and delayed (following recovery) effects of ISS on wake neuron cell metabolics, cell counts, and sleep/wake patterns.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Results:** ISS resulted in sustained disruption of sleep/wake activity, with increased wakefulness during the lights-on period and reduced wake bout duration and wake time during the lights-off period. Noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) and orexinergic neurons showed persistent alterations in morphology, and reductions in both neuronal stereological cell counts and fronto-cortical projections. Surviving wake-activated neurons evidenced persistent reductions in sirtuins 1 and 3 and increased lipofuscin. In contrast, ISS resulted in no lasting injury to the sleep-activated melanin concentrating hormone neurons.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Conclusions:** Collectively these findings demonstrate for the first time that ISS imparts significant lasting disturbances in sleep/wake activity, degeneration of wake-activated LC and orexinergic neurons, and lasting metabolic changes in remaining neurons most consistent with premature senescence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**These are the information generated by the AI:**\n\nAbstract summary:\n\n&gt;Intermittent short sleep imparts significant lasting disturbances in sleep/wake activity, degeneration of wake-activated locus coeruleus and orexinergic neurons, and lasting metabolic changes.\n\nParticipants:\n\n&gt;18 mice in United States who were either in the \"rested control\" group or in 1 of the \"intermittent short sleep\" groups\n\nOutcomes measured:\n\n&gt;\\- sleep/wake activity  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- cell counts  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- sleep/wake patterns  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- morphology  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- projections\n\nIt can also answer custom questions. I asked: \"What chemical changes resulted in the degeneration of the locus coeruleus?\"\n\nIt answered:\n\n&gt;The chemical changes that resulted in the degeneration of the locus coeruleus are the loss of SirT1 and SirT3, and the increased lipofuscin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt also highlights the text passages which its answers are based on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think about tools like this?",

This was independent of age, sex, or body size, implying some underlying difference in musculature and nerve reaction.\n\nMy friend countered with [this article](https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/health-general-science/are-you-there-race-its-me-dna), which calls into question whether or not \"race\" is a relevant term, and which points out that genetic diversity between we humans is really quite small. There was also [this interesting discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/10m8st/from_a_genetic_perspective_are_human_races/) along similar lines here on Reddit several years ago.\n\nFor the sake of this, let's ignore DNA testing, which I understand to be quite accurate for determining heritage. I'm also not fully convinced that arguments regarding the similarity or dis-similarity of the genetic code in a population is actually relevant. Even a tiny mutation can lead to [dramatic differences](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/gk-and-current-affairs/story/genetic-disorders-263627-2015-09-18) in structure.\n\nSo, rephrasing the question... can examination of the skeleton and/or internal organs provide sufficient information to determine whether someone is primarily from one population or another?",

Why can’t we just say that the black holes are the parts where the universe shrinks while the rest is the part of universe which expands? For me it would make a perfect sense. Similarly as you cannot reach or see the edge of the universe because it is expanding faster then speed of light beyond some border, you cannot see inside the black holes because the universe is shrinking there faster than speed of light. Imagine all the stars as particles inside the slimy substance, when the substance is pulled at some point the distance between particles increases.",

What makes one temporary and the other permanent?\n\nAlso, does image retention really disappear or will there always be a ghost image of what was displayed if it is never overpowered by another image (for example if you turn off the screen immediately after displaying an image)?",
