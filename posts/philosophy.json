[{"title":"Welcome to \/r\/philosophy! Check out our rules and guidelines here.","author":"BernardJOrtcutt","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/philosophy\/comments\/wj9mbo\/welcome_to_rphilosophy_check_out_our_rules_and\/","text":"#Welcome to \/r\/philosophy!\n\nWelcome to \/r\/philosophy! We're a community dedicated to discussing philosophy-related topics, problems, and questions. This post will go over our subreddit rules and guidelines that you should review *before* you begin posting here. \n\n#\/r\/philosophy's Mission\n\n\/r\/philosophy strives to be a community where everyone, regardless of their background, can come to discuss philosophy. This means that all posts should be primarily philosophical in nature. What do we mean by that?\n\n#What Is Philosophy?\n\nAs with most disciplines, \"philosophy\" has both a casual and a technical usage. \n\nIn its casual use, \"philosophy\" may refer to nearly any sort of thought or beliefs, and include topics such as religion, mysticism and even science. When someone asks you what \"your philosophy\" is, this is the sort of sense they have in mind; they're asking about your general system of thoughts, beliefs, and feelings.\n\nIn its technical use -- the use relevant here at \/r\/philosophy -- philosophy is a particular area of study which can be broadly grouped into several major areas, including:\n\n* Aesthetics, the study of beauty\n* Epistemology, the study of knowledge and belief\n* Ethics, the study of what we owe to one another\n* Logic, the study of what follows from what\n* Metaphysics, the study of the basic nature of existence and reality\n\nas well as various subfields of 'philosophy of X', including philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, philosophy of science and many others.\n\nPhilosophy in the narrower, technical sense that philosophers use and which \/r\/philosophy is devoted to is defined not only by its subject matter, but by its methodology and attitudes. Something is not philosophical merely because it states some position related to those areas. There must also be an emphasis on *argument* (setting forward reasons for adopting a position) and a willingness to subject arguments to various criticisms.\n\n#What Isn't Philosophy?\n\nAs you can see from the above description of philosophy, philosophy often crosses over with other fields of study, including art, mathematics, politics, religion and the sciences. That said, in order to keep this subreddit focused on philosophy we require that all posts be primarily philosophical in nature, and defend a distinctively philosophical thesis. \n\nAs a rule of thumb, something does not count as philosophy for the purposes of this subreddit if:\n\n* It does not address a philosophical topic or area of philosophy\n* It may more accurately belong to another area of study (e.g. religion or science)\n* No attempt is made to argue for a position's conclusions\n\nSome more specific topics which are popularly misconstrued as philosophical but do *not* meet this definition and thus are not appropriate for this subreddit include:\n\n* Drug experiences (e.g. \"I dropped acid today and experienced the oneness of the universe...\")\n* Mysticism (e.g. \"I meditated today and experienced the oneness of the universe...\")\n* Politics (e.g. \"This is why everyone should support the Voting Rights Act\")\n* Self-help (e.g. \"How can I be a happier person and have more people like me?\")\n* Theology (e.g. \"Here's how Catholic theology explains transubstantiation\")\n\n#\/r\/philosophy's Posting Rules\n\nIn order to best serve our mission of fostering a community for discussion of philosophy and philosophical issues, we have the following rules which govern all posts made to \/r\/philosophy:\n\n###PR1: All posts must be about philosophy.\n> To learn more about what is and is not considered philosophy for the purposes of this subreddit, see our [FAQ](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/philosophy\/wiki\/faq). Posts must be about philosophy proper, rather than only tangentially connected to philosophy. Exceptions are made only for posts about philosophers with substantive content, e.g. news about the profession, interviews with philosophers.\n\n###PR2: All posts must develop and defend a substantive philosophical thesis.\n> Posts must not only have a philosophical subject matter, but must also present this subject matter in a developed manner. At a minimum, this includes: stating the problem being addressed; stating the thesis; anticipating some objections to the stated thesis and giving responses to them. These are just the minimum requirements. Posts about well-trod issues (e.g. free will) require more development.\n\n###PR3: Questions belong in \/r\/askphilosophy.\n> \/r\/philosophy is intended for philosophical material and discussion. Please direct all questions to \/r\/askphilosophy.\n\n###PR4: Post titles cannot be questions and must describe the philosophical content of the posted material.\n> Post titles cannot contain questions, even if the title of the linked material is a question. This helps keep discussion in the comments on topic and relevant to the linked material. Post titles must describe the philosophical content of the posted material, cannot be unduly provocative, click-baity, unnecessarily long or in all caps.\n\n###PR5: Audio\/video links require abstracts.\n> All links to either audio or video content require abstracts of the posted material, posted as a comment in the thread. Abstracts should make clear what the linked material is about and what its thesis is. Users are also strongly encouraged to post abstracts for other linked material. [See here for an example of a suitable abstract](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/philosophy\/wiki\/abstracts).\n\n###PR6: All posts must be in English.\n> All posts must be in English. Links to Google Translated versions of posts, or posts only containing English subtitles are not allowed.\n\n###PR7: Links behind paywalls or registration walls are not allowed.\n> Posts must not be behind any sort of paywall or registration wall. If the linked material requires signing up to view, even if the account is free, it is not allowed. Google Drive links and link shorteners are not allowed.\n\n###PR8: Meta-posts, products, services, surveys, AMAs require moderator pre-approval.\n> The following (not exhaustive) list of items require moderator pre-approval: meta-posts, posts to products, services or surveys, links to other areas of reddit, AMAs. Please contact the moderators for pre-approval via modmail.\n\n###PR9: Users may submit only one post per day.\n> Users may never post more than one post per day. Users must follow all [reddit-wide spam guidelines](https:\/\/reddit.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360043504051-What-constitutes-spam-Am-I-a-spammer-), in addition to the \/r\/philosophy [self-promotion guidelines](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/philosophy\/wiki\/selfpromotion).\n\n###PR10: Discussion of suicide is only allowed in the abstract.\n> \/r\/philosophy is not a mental health subreddit. Discussion of suicide is only allowed in the abstract here. If you or a friend is feeling suicidal please visit \/r\/suicidewatch. If you are feeling suicidal, please get help by visiting \/r\/suicidewatch or using other resources. See also our discussion of philosophy and mental health issues [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/philosophy\/wiki\/mentalhealth). Encouraging other users to commit suicide, even in the abstract, is strictly forbidden.\n\n#\/r\/philosophy's Commenting Rules\nIn the same way that our posting rules above attempt to promote our mission by governing posts, the following commenting rules attempt to promote \/r\/philosophy's mission to be a community focused on philosophical discussion.\n\n###CR1: Read\/Listen\/Watch the Posted Content Before You Reply\n> Read\/watch\/listen the posted content, understand and identify the philosophical arguments given, and respond to these substantively. If you have unrelated thoughts or don't wish to read the content, please post your own thread or simply refrain from commenting. Comments which are clearly not in direct response to the posted content may be removed.\n\n###CR2:  Argue Your Position\n> Opinions are not valuable here, arguments are! Comments that solely express musings, opinions, beliefs, or assertions without argument may be removed.\n\n###CR3: Be Respectful\n> Comments which consist of personal attacks will be removed. Users with a history of such comments may be banned. Slurs, racism, and bigotry are absolutely not permitted.\n\n###Miscellaneous Posting and Commenting Guidelines\n\nIn addition to the rules above, we have a list of miscellaneous guidelines which users should also be aware of:\n\n* Reposting a post or comment which was removed will be treated as circumventing moderation and result in a permanent ban.\n* Posts and comments which flagrantly violate the rules, especially in a trolling manner, will be removed and treated as shitposts, and may result in a ban.\n* No reposts of material posted within the last year.\n* No posts of entire books, articles over 50 pages, or podcasts\/videos that are longer than 1.5 hours. \n* No posts of AI-created or AI-assisted text or audio.\n* Posts which link to material should be posted by submitting a link, rather than making a text post. [Please see here for a guide on how to properly submit links](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/philosophy\/wiki\/submitlinks).\n\n#Frequently Asked Questions\n\nBelow are some frequently asked questions. If you have other questions, please [contact the moderators via modmail](https:\/\/reddit.com\/message\/compose\/?to=\/r\/philosophy) (not via private message or chat).\n\n###My post or comment was removed. How can I get an explanation?\nAlmost all posts\/comments which are removed will receive an explanation of their removal. That explanation will generally by \/r\/philosophy's custom bot, \/u\/BernardJOrtcutt, and will list the removal reason. Posts which are removed will be notified via a stickied comment; comments which are removed will be notified via a reply. If your post or comment resulted in a ban, the message will be included in the ban message via modmail. If you have further questions, please [contact the moderators](https:\/\/reddit.com\/message\/compose\/?to=\/r\/philosophy).\n\n###How can I appeal my post or comment removal?\nTo appeal a removal, please [contact the moderators](https:\/\/reddit.com\/message\/compose\/?to=\/r\/philosophy). Do not delete your comments, as this will make an appeal impossible. Reposting removed posts\/comments without receiving mod approval will result in a permanent ban.\n\n###How can I appeal my ban?\nTo appeal a ban, please respond to the modmail informing you of your ban. Do note delete your posts\/comments, as this will make an appeal impossible. \n\n###My comment was removed or I was banned for arguing with someone else, but they started it. Why was I punished and not them?\nSomeone else breaking the rules does not give you permission to break the rules as well. \/r\/philosophy does not comment on actions taken on other accounts, but all violations are treated as equitably as possible.\n\n###I found a post or comment which breaks the rules, but which wasn't removed. How can I help?\nIf you see a post or comment which you believe breaks the rules, please report it using the report function for the appropriate rule. \/r\/philosophy's moderators are volunteers, and it is impossible for us to manually review every comment on every thread. We appreciate your help in reporting comments which break the rules.\n\n###My post isn't showing up, but I didn't receive a removal notification. What happened?\nSometimes the Automod filter will automatically send posts to a filter for moderator approval, especially from accounts which are new or haven't posted to \/r\/philosophy before. If your post has not been approved or removed within 24 hours, please [contact the moderators](https:\/\/reddit.com\/message\/compose\/?to=\/r\/philosophy).\n\n###My post was removed and referred to the Open Discussion Thread. What does this mean?\nThe Open Discussion Thread (ODT) is \/r\/philosophy's place for posts\/comments which are related to philosohpy but do not necessarily meet our posting rules (especially PR2). For example, these threads are great places for:\n\n* Arguments that aren't substantive enough to meet PR2\n* Open discussion about philosophy, e.g. \"who is your favorite philosopher?\"\n* Philosophical questions\n\nIf your post was removed and referred to the ODT, it likely meets PR1 but did not meet PR2, and we encourage you to consider posting it to the ODT to share with others.\n\n###My comment responding to someone else was removed, as well as their comment. What happened?\nWhen \/r\/philosophy removes a parent comment, it also removes all their child comments in order to help readability and focus on discussion.\n\n###How can I tell if my post was approved?\n\/r\/philosophy counts posts as approved when they are granted post flair. If your post has not been granted flair, it has not yet been approved and may still be removed. All posts will eventually be approved and granted flair or removed; please do not contact the moderators to request flair for a non-removed post.\n\n###What do the different post flairs mean?\n[See here for a full breakdown of our post flairs](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/philosophy\/wiki\/postflair). Of the most commonly used flairs, 'Article' refers to a peer-reviewed academic article, 'Blog' refers to a non-academic or non-peer reviewed blog or post, 'Paper' refers to a non-peer reviewed paper, 'Podcast' refers to an audio only podcast or video and 'Video' refers to a video which features both audio and visual elements.\n\n###I'm interested in philosophy. Where should I start? What should I read?\nAs explained above, philosophy is a very broad discipline and thus offering concise advice on where to start is very hard. We recommend reading [this \/r\/AskPhilosophyFAQ post](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/AskPhilosophyFAQ\/comments\/4ifqi3\/im_interested_in_philosophy_where_should_i_start\/) which has a great breakdown of various places to start. For further or more specific questions, we recommend posting on \/r\/askphilosophy.\n\n###Why is your understanding of philosophy so limited?\nAs explained above, this subreddit is devoted to philosophy as understood and done by philosophers. In order to prevent this subreddit from becoming \/r\/atheism2, \/r\/politics2, or \/r\/science2, we must uphold a strict topicality requirement in PR1. Posts which may touch on philosophical themes but are not distinctively philosophical can be posted to one of reddit's many other subreddits.\n\n###Why do you not allow questions in the title of posts?\nMany years of allowing posts to have questions in their titles, and viewing other subreddits which allow such titles reveals that allowing questions in the titles of posts leads to a majority of comments which simply answer the question in the title without contributing anything else to the discussion. As a discussion subreddit, \/r\/philosophy requires that all comments adhere to the three commenting rules above (CR1-3), and thus questions in post titles are incompatible with our goals and posting rules.\n\n###Are there other philosophy subreddits I can check out?\nIf you are interested in other philosophy subreddits, please see [this list of related subreddits](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/philosophy\/wiki\/sublinks). \/r\/philosophy shares much of its modteam with its sister-subreddit, \/r\/askphilosophy, which is devoted to philosophical questions and answers as opposed to discussion. In addition, that list includes more specialized subreddits and more casual subreddits for those looking for a less-regulated forum.\n\n###A thread I wanted to comment in was locked. What happened?\nWhen a post becomes unreasonable to moderate due to the amount of rule-breaking comments the thread is locked. \/r\/philosophy's moderators are volunteers, and we cannot spend hours cleaning up individual threads.\n\n###Why don't you allow the posting of full books or very long podcasts?\nAs \/r\/philosophy is dedicated to discussion, all posts should be able to serve as a reasonable foundation for a discussion, and posts of this length simply require too much of commenters to reasonably engage with.\n\n###Can I post my own material on \/r\/philosophy?\nYes, \/r\/philosophy allows self-promotion, but only when it follows our [guidelines on self-promotion](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/philosophy\/wiki\/selfpromotion).\n\nAll self-promotion must adhere to the following guidelines:\n\n* You may not post links to your own content more than 3 times in a 7 day period.\n* You may not post promote your own content in the comments of other threads, including the Open Discussion Thread.\n* All links to your own content must be submitted as linked posts ([see here for more details](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/philosophy\/wiki\/submitlinks)).\n* You may not repost your own content until after 1 year since its last submission, regardless of whether you were the person who originally submitted it.\n* Once your post has been approved and flaired by a moderator you may not delete it, to preserve a record of its posting.\n* You may not use multiple accounts to submit your own content. You may choose to switch to a new account for the purposes of posting your content by [contacting the moderators](https:\/\/reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fphilosophy).\n* All posts must meet all of our standard [posting rules](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/philosophy\/wiki\/rules).\n\nYou are responsible for knowing and following these policies, all of which have been implemented to combat spammers taking advantage of \/r\/philosophy and its users. **If you are found to have violated any of these policies we may take any number of actions, including banning your account or platform either temporarily or permanently.** \n\nIf you have any questions about the self-promotion policies, including whether a particular post would be acceptable, please [contact the moderators](https:\/\/reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fphilosophy) before submission.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1659967304.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"\/r\/philosophy Open Discussion Thread | March 06, 2023","author":"BernardJOrtcutt","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/philosophy\/comments\/11jzpvr\/rphilosophy_open_discussion_thread_march_06_2023\/","text":"Welcome to this week's Open Discussion Thread.

Life has many suffering due random bad luck, some humans and animals will always be suffering terribly and die in agony, living a life that is horribly not worth its existence by most standards. \n2. Since suffering is perpetual for the unlucky, therefore they argued that it is not fair for the rest of existence to continue at their expense, meaning if SOME have to suffer, then NONE should exist. \n3. So in order to permanently prevent future unlucky sufferers, it is our moral obligation to find a way to painlessly and instantaneously \"Remove\" all life from earth, think Thanos snap but with all life on earth. lol \n4. Basically, if suffering is perpetual or takes a long time to be solved by future technology, then life on earth should not continue, because the unlucky suffering of some lives far outweighs the \"decent\" lives of the rest. (ex: Negative utilitarianism)\n5. Since nobody asked to be born (animals as well), then nobody consented to their suffering and sacrifice, thus it is doubly immoral for life on earth to keep existing at their expense. \n\nOk, what is your counter for these arguments? lol","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1678126079.0},{"author":"rickidontsleep","text":"Alan Watts says you can\u2019t know yourself, Jordan Peterson says watch your every thought & action to know yourself.

It provides a basis, given gravity is in a way a sort of vague invisible concept that is actually the biggest concept that has yet to be fully understood (gravity, matter, space, energy and time relationship), that is sensible to human scale. Think of leverage. Leverage is something we can witness at macro scale and see as true in front of us. Between gravity, electromagnetism, reduced scale microchip technologies and many other post modern theories (facts, I'm referring to proven scientific theory not theoretical notions) that have been implemented in real use cases, we have tricked ourselves into being able to become too imaginative about what these really mean, about how it contests the more macro scale and visible interpretations.\n\nYet these things are layered. Newtonian mechanics has not been disproven, is still accurate, and is still used almost exclusively in the applied fields of mechanics for anything other than extraterrestrial applications where it does fall short by not including additional factors necessary for extraterrestrial conditions. It remains the most effective and elegant explanation for terrestrial applications.\n\nI've been thinking about this sort of trick of the mind in relation to artificial intelligence. I'm not an expert, yet I do have a pretty strong technical understanding of programming and other relevant concepts. I don't think we have anything even close to what people intuit AI to mean. It is fancy scripting. The complexity and recursivity we have developed only make the script fancier, not intelligent. I've landed on this description of these things being \"poetic descriptions.\" It is poetic that we can refer to the imitation of intelligence as if it *is* intelligence.\n\nTake a phone. I can readily poetically describe this as a technology that allows a person to be in 2 places at once. It provides the imitation of such, within a specific set of boundaries. Yet it is entirely poetic. This has not actually allowed people to be in 2 places at once has it?\n\nTake the forefront of some of the most \"wow factor\" technologies now coming about. Let's look at neuralink and the insanely bold, and poetic descriptions. They advertise the description of a direct human machine interface. You can call it that and it's not entirely false. Yet when people of a non technical understanding hear that poetic description, they imagine something entirely false. The actual application pursued is to allow a paralyzed person to \"text with their mind.\" Yet there is a very clear distinction to be drawn between what this implies and how it actually works. Similar tech to this was first around in the 1990s, quite a bit ago. That form wasn't a direct chip implant, but rather an eye movement reader. A paralyzed individual that can still move their eyes can text by learning a new language, so to speak, by using their eye movements, which are tracked optically and translated into letters and words. As far as I know, the brain implant is still at this level. We are splicing into the neural synapses that represent the occurence of things like eye movement, and playing it into a processer and algorithm that translates those synaptical signals into a language. \n\nAs a crude example that actually works similarly, consider a toy that claimed to allow you to \"control objects with your mind.\" You put on a headband that reads your pulse and blood pressure. You then \"concentrate\" on a ball in a track. The ball is lifted and moved around the track, past obstacles, via a system of air nozzles that \"respond to your thoughts.\" Yet it simply allocated up for increased pulse rate, down for decreased, etc. By interfacing with this, a person can learn to \"control\" it. We begin to intuitively identify being able to make the ball go up by concentrating, but we have simply learned through semi-haptic feedback that a certain approach to concentrating, nuances with breathing patterns, replicate this pulse rate relationship. It is very far from controlling objects with the mind haha. Yet we can give it that description *poetically.*\n\nThese \"cybernetic enhancements\" we are getting wowed by are like this. There is nothing even remotely close to actually translating direct human thought into machine language. We are not producing tech that allows people to text with their minds, unless we cede that description as being poetic. We are producing clever approaches and algorithms that allow a person to connect various electrochemical measurements via things like parasympathic nervous system functionalities. This denotes a truly massive difference between what so many people seem to think we are accomplishing vs the reality.\n\nThis is how I view these metaphysical models in the grouping of universal consciousness. The idea that matter is a reflection of such.\n\nWe have to walk back our imaginations and poetic descriptions. Matter isn't solid. It doesn't exist the way we think it does. All existence is genuinely 99.9% empty space. There are no actual solid collisions between your hand and a table, just electromagnetism. Solids are formed through electochemical bonds. Yet does this contest reality? Because it creates a description, an accurate one, that goes beyond the human (macro) scale of understanding of the interpretation of the meaning of \"solid?\" I say not. We should rather realize that solid actually refers, under the hood so to speak, to something different than it intuitively means to us. Yet the solid objects remain, entirely to the extent that they always have been there, and function entirely by the same rules and interactions that we allocate by calling it a solid object.\n\nMatter and energy are the same thing. Yet this does not truly open the door to these wild ideations we have seemed to develop in terms of metaphysical models.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1678635481.0},{"author":"thismightbsatire","text":"As above, so below, huh?","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1678644896.0},{"author":"ronin1066","text":"Is there a transcript?","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1678645036.0},{"author":"Ma3Ke4Li3","text":"**Abstract**\n\nMaterialism is the mainstream view in modern metaphysics. It has two tenets: (1) that everything that exists is exhaustively made of matter and (2) that matter is exhaustively explained by described by quantitative measurements (e.g. mass, volume, charge). So how do we get qualitative experiences from quantitative matter? In other words, how do we get feeling and meaning if our mental lives are exhaustively explained without reference to feelings or meanings? This is the hard problem of consciousness. \n\n  \nAccording to Bernardo Kastrup, the problem should not exist in the first place. Instead, we should start from the notion that everything empirical or rational we ever know is a mental phenomenon (e.g. experiences or thoughts). Mind comes first. Matter is a construct of the mind, which captures the regularities in the way that this mental universe functions. This is not Berkeleyan idealism, for it does not claim that everything is inside \u201cmy\u201d mind. Rather, it is similar to Schopenhauer\u2019s theory of the world as Will (mind) and Representation (matter).   \n\n\nIn this episode, Kastrup explains why idealism can help us make sense of various scientific findings in neuroscience, which show that decreases in brain activity lead to increased levels of experience but decreased levels of dissociation. Kastrup also responds to criticisms; such as lack of mentality in deep sleep and coma; and contrasts his view with panpsychism and neutral monism.   \n***This is a re-post from last week; the earlier version was taken down due to an editorial issue.***","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1678625646.0},{"author":"Signifyz","text":"Interesting episode with Langan and Kastrup: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HsXxgQy4xLQ","upvotes":-2,"created_utc":1678630085.0}]},{"title":"The philosophy of Beccaria is relevant to understand the current mental health crisis.

In case you don\u2019t know, Son Goku\u2019s story is that he was very aggressive and brutal as a kid or baby (as Saiyans normally are) but as a consequence of falling off a cliff and hurting his head badly, his character changed to being very caring and even \u2018pure of heart\u2019.\r  \nSo the question, which I also think is philosophically and psychologically interesting, is whether injuries (to the brain) can make people a better person. For that I first take a closer look at what happened to Phineas Gage, who became \u2018less moral by accident\u2019. After he injured parts of his brain, his character changed to being less socially convenient than before the accident.\n\n\r  \nOne of the explanations given in the research literature is that his self-control and emotional regulation was impaired by the brain damage. And indeed if we look at research on the sources of criminal behavior, we find that self-control often pops up as a source of the problem.\n\n\r  \nDespite self-control, certain emotional capacities and emotional regulation are quite important for ethical behavior. If we look at case of the Williams Beuren Syndrome, where people are very empathetic and kind due to a gene deletion, we find that this overactive emotional capacity leads to certain pro-social behavior (as being very caring regarding other people).\n\n\r  \nSo if we have self-control, emotional capacities, and emotional regulation as important sources of moral behavior that can be impacted by damage to the brain or genetic variation, we can try an explanation of how the moral character change of Son Goku is potentially plausible.\n\n\r  \nWhen Goku fell off a cliff and hurt his head, the best explanation of Goku\u2019s change would be that his emotional regulation was hindered before the accident. After the accident, he had more control over his aggressive Saiyan nature, and also more room to express other emotions such as empathy, pity, and guilt.\n\n\r  \nThis is of course still very fictitious, but I like the idea that we can actually give a somewhat plausible philosophical and psychological story of this trope in one of my favorite animes!","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1678644564.0}]},{"title":"The Stoics think the only thing needed for a good, happy life is excellent character, something we can all develop \u2014 regardless of our circumstances \u2014 by cultivating four core virtues.

There aren't four specific virtues that all stoics prescribe to. I think stoicism in general is probably about Temperance the most. Woo way from taoism. And so on.\n\nBecause by definition the word stoic means Stone like. So, the biggest attribute of that would be temperance. That's going to be the main factor that brings you to a stone like state of existence. However stoics are usually more positive than negative. People are usually stoic in the face of conflict. Although some might also be called stoic if they aren't able to loosen up and laugh at things. But I think the word is usually used in reference to conflicts.\n\nSo I don't think there are just four virtues. I think the main one is temperance. But, I think the stoics do consider wisdom as the main virtue. But in actuality it's probably temperance because that's what makes them stoic. But then you could probably also list off a million virtues.\n\nCourage does make sense because if you think of a stone, you think of strength. But not brash and loud strength. More like a defensive strength, like a moat or a castle.\n\nI think Justice is a good one but, I think it's more about kindness. Because Justice is the flip side of revenge. Justice and revenge are the same ideal looked at in a different light. And I think kindness is what allows stoics to step away from things.\n\nA lot of nihilists, actually all nihilists, don't understand kindness. They don't understand that you have to be kind to yourself as well as others. For some reason they find that as a confusing idea.\n\nBut when you're kind to yourself, you're able to step away from your anger. You're able to step away from your pain. Because you are being kind to yourself. You understand that you're hurting and you don't want to hurt anymore. So you step away from that.

The universe exists; it is nothing that grows into existence and that passes out of existence. Or, better still, it develops, it passes away, but it never began to develop, and has never ceased from passing away; it maintains itself in both states. It lives on itself, its excrements are its nourishment. We need not concern ourselves for one instant with the hypothesis of a created world. The concept create is to-day utterly indefinable and unrealisable; it is but a word which hails from superstitious ages, nothing can be explained with a word. The last attempt that was made to conceive of a world that began occurred quite recently, in many cases with the help of logical reasoning,\u2014generally, too, as you will guess, with an ulterior theological motive. Several attempts have been made lately to show that the concept that \"the universe has an infinite past (regressus in infinitum) is contradictory, it was even demonstrated, it is true, at the price of confounding the head with the tail. Nothing can prevent me from calculating backwards from this moment of time, and of saying: \"I shall never reach the end\"; just as I can calculate without end in a forward direction, from the same moment. It is only when I wish to commit the error\u2014I shall be careful to avoid it\u2014of reconciling this correct concept of a regressus in infinitum with the absolutely unrealisable concept of a finite progressus up to the present; only when I consider the direction (forwards or backwards) as logically indifferent, that I take hold of the head\u2014this very moment\u2014and think I hold the tail: this pleasure I leave to you, Mr. D\u00fchring!... \n\nI have come across this thought in other thinkers before me, and every time I found that it was determined by other ulterior motives (chiefly theological, in favour of a creator spiritus). If the universe were in any way able to congeal, to dry up, to perish; or if it were capable of attaining to a state of equilibrium; or if it had any kind of goal at all which a long lapse of time, immutability, and finality reserved for it (in short, to speak metaphysically, if becoming could resolve itself into being or into nonentity), this state ought already to have been reached. But it has not been reached: it therefore follows.... \n\nThis is the only certainty we can grasp, which can serve as a corrective to a host of cosmic hypotheses possible in themselves. If, for instance, materialism cannot consistently escape the conclusion of a finite state, which William Thomson has traced out for it, then materialism is thereby refuted. [Pg 428] If the universe may be conceived as a definite quantity of energy, as a definite number of centres of energy,\u2014and every other concept remains indefinite and therefore useless,\u2014it follows therefrom that the universe must go through a calculable number of combinations in the great game of chance which constitutes its existence. In infinity, at some moment or other, every possible combination must once have been realised; not only this, but it must have been realised an infinite number of times. And inasmuch as between every one of these combinations and its next recurrence every other possible combination would necessarily have been undergone, and since every one of these combinations would determine the whole series in the same order, a circular movement of absolutely identical series is thus demonstrated: the universe is thus shown to be a circular movement which has already repeated itself an infinite number of times, and which plays its game for all eternity.\u2014This conception is not simply materialistic; for if it were this, it would not involve an infinite recurrence of identical cases, but a finite state. Owing to the fact that the universe has not reached this finite state, materialism shows itself to be but an imperfect and provisional hypothesis.\u201d 1067.\n\n\u2014-\n\n\u201cAnd do ye know what \"the universe\" is to my mind? Shall I show it to you in my mirror? This universe is a monster of energy, without beginning or end; a fixed and brazen quantity o; energy which grows neither bigger nor smaller, which does not consume itself, but only alters its face; as a whole its bulk is immutable, it is a household without either losses\nor gains, but likewise without increase and without sources of revenue, surrounded by nonentity as by a frontier, it is nothing vague or wasteful, it does not stretch into infinity; but it is a definite quantum of energy located in limited space, and not in space which would be anywhere empty. \n\nIt is rather energy everywhere, the play of forces and force-waves, at the same time one and many, agglomerating here and diminishing there, a sea of forces storming and raging in itself, for ever changing, for ever rolling back over in calculable ages to recurrence, with an ebb and flow of its forms, producing the most complicated things out of the most simple structures; producing the most ardent, most savage, and most contradictory things out of the quietest, most rigid, and most frozen material, and then returning from multifariousness to uniformity, from the play of contradictions back into the delight of consonance, saying yea unto itself, even in this homogeneity of its courses and ages; for ever blessing itself as something which recurs for all eternity,\u2014a becoming which knows not satiety, or disgust, or weariness:\u2014this, my Dionysian world of eternal self-creation, of eternal self-destruction, this mysterious world of twofold voluptuousness; this, my \"Beyond Good and Evil\" without aim, unless there is an aim in the bliss of the circle, without will, unless a ring must by nature keep goodwill to itself,\u2014would you have a name for my world?

An absolutist would forbid intentionally killing an innocent person, no matter how many other innocents you could save by doing so. Jackson & Smith (2006), Huemer (2010), and Isaacs (2014) argue that absolutism has special problems handling cases where it is not certain whether your actions violate the prohibition. I show that there is no special problem for absolutism. Absolutists can handle risky cases in a principled way. First, absolutists need to identify a point of moral certainty: if an action is sufficiently likely to violate an absolute prohibition, it can be treated as if it will. Second, they need to identify a point of hope: if an action is sufficiently unlikely to violate a prohibition, it can be treated as if it won't. From there, absolutists can generate an expected value function. Whatever problems absolutism has, they do not arise from risk. I prove three theorems concerning the existence and uniqueness of expected value representations for absolutism. I also defend the theory against the objections that it violates agglomeration principles, fails in the long run, and sacrifices the motivations for absolutism.","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1678490765.0}]},{"title":"I just published an article in The Journal of Mind and Behavior arguing that free will is real.

This line, therefore, is something akin to a straw man. That accusation can only be perversely rebutted by the fact that we know molecules are not indivisible, and not always stable.

Basic idea: free will is the ability to do other than expected, where the expect-or is Laplace\u2019s demon. Some human actions meet this condition, because the human brain is an undecidable computational system.\n\nI had a couple of issues.\n\nFirst, intuitively free will involves the possibility of any of multiple courses of action (looking in the future direction, to use the language is the article). The objection to this in the article is basically, when you\u2019re making the choice, you\u2019re only doing one thing. So, it doesn\u2019t make sense to say there are multiple possibilities open to you. To the contrary, we can say that at time t1, it is possible that at time t2 I am doing A, or that I am doing B, whereas at time t2 it is only possible that I am doing 1. \n\nBut I don\u2019t think that matters much, since the project is still interesting.\n\nSecond, key to establishing that the human brain is an undefinable computational system is the claim that the brain has infinite state spaces. This is supported by the fact that we can conceive of the natural numbers, which are infinite.\n\nI\u2019m not convinced that this means the human brain has infinite state spaces. We never conceive of each natural number itself. What is true is that for any of we can conceive of any of an infinite number of sets of numbers, but each of those will be of finite size. It is also true that we can think such terms \u201cas infinite\u201d, and various associated ideas, \u201c1-to-1 mapping onto the natural numbers\u201d for instance, but everything we\u2019re ever actually thinking is finite.\n\n Basically, it\u2019s possible to represent some facts about infinite sets with finite information, which seems to be what we actually do.\n\nAs an additional comment, the article also contained a discussion of human decision-making being self-referential. It\u2019s a bit long, but you may want to check out [this talk](https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=RRqCSgWdwuA) by Jenann Ismael, in which she makes the self-referential aspect of decision-making key to an account of free will.","upvotes":7,"created_utc":1678396920.0},{"author":"Vainti","text":"Humans don\u2019t have the total self reference you talk about on 313.

Humans are not aware of all our processes, down to each cell, as such a thing would be computationally impossible. However, our actual level of awareness is no more impossible than a pc showing you a task manager. Our current level of self reference doesn\u2019t meet this requirement for undecidablility. \n\n\nYou already raised the correct objection to infinite state spaces. I think I can illustrate it with an analogy. Saying \u201cHumans have infinite state spaces because we have an impression left by even very large numbers,\u201d is like saying, \u201cThis computer has infinitely more storage space than you think.

Coming from a phenomenological background, I'm sensing the thinking in your paper is very deeply based on von Bertalanffy's General System theory, which is derivative of theoretical Thermodynamics and \u2014 as such \u2014 is a particular type of temporality characterized as synchronic. It also appears you\u2019re further delimiting temporality as the notorious \"arrow of time,\u201d which only moves forward with its implicit assumptions of \u201cfree will\u201d based on definitions of an independent self. This is compared to general synchrony temporality that functions as the \u201cinfinitely, eternalized equal sign\u201d that metaphorically can be thought of as a digital video file that can be played forwards and backward.\n\n\nWhile I certainly don't mean to be negatively critical, I should mention this notion of \"radical free will\" vs. \"situated freedom\" articulated by the Economic Philosopher Charles A. Taylor. Particularly since I'm sensing your image of temporal Asymmetry is a negative dialectic of the diachronic existential temporality Heidegger attempted to explicate as his \u201ccare structure of comportment\u201d in Being and Time he was deriving from Henr\u00e9 Bergson's \u201cDur\u00e9e\u201d and his colleague Heisenberg articulated as the \u201cuncertainty principle.\u201d But, of course, Heidegger didn\u2019t complete his masterwork as he hadn\u2019t sufficiently thought through temporality; instead, he brought the Nietzschean shift to psychological understandings of temporality in an age of \u201cpost-truth\u201d into sharp relief that your writing about. At least, that\u2019s my sense reading your paper.\n\nMore to the point is that phenomenologically your notion of Temporal Asymmetry is very reminiscent of Emmanual Levinas' notions of Time and the Other that fleshes out synchronic temporality as derivative of existential diachrony \u2014 where the future is unknown and arises from what his colleague, Maurice Blanchot, articulated as the Infinite Conversation from which all notions of an independent individual with free-will are \u201calways, already situated in\u201d as \u201cthe there\u201d \u2014 which both thought of as the \u201cImpossible of the Possible.\u201d Personally, I understand this as what Martin Burckhardt refers to as the \"dividual\" that must be considered within the context of the \"Psychology of the Machine,\u201d meaning the rational edifice\u2019s digital metaphysics of Modernity.\n\nHaving \"said\" that, I think you're quite right in noticing how digital metaphysics simulacrums dissimulate as rational machinations without any inherent notion of value, and \u201cas such,\u201d always require human discrimination to give them meaning (which is not to side-step the arguments of AI's achieving sentience \u2014 just for all practical purposes, they are currently \"dumb\" assistive tools that extend human \u201ccreation ex nihilo.\u201d) And that humans are always required to make choices without totally understanding the implications of their choices; more importantly humans are not \u201cfated things\u201d as we live in an open filigree of coherency full of possibility, which I think is what you\u2019re articulating as Infinite Computational Medium; and that this design of coherency is a reflection of our inherent antilogy. What I think is possibly missing is understanding how the notion of an independent self is a kind of artifice reflecting the shifting from \u201crappresentare to representatio\u201d in the Renaissance, which becomes the Cartesian subject\/object split. As you continue investigating your question, you may want to consider how the independent individual exercising free will is always derivative of the community background from which the \u201cdividual\u201d sense of self arises. And, more importantly, how our continued transition into Modernity\u2019s digitalization, as Social Media and the like, continues to bring this into sharper relief.","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1678478895.0},{"author":"writesmakeleft","text":"When was this published?","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1678392497.0},{"author":"Tioben","text":"The first time I tried tickling myself, I expected to experience the urge to laugh.

Example quantum systems and reality may be fundamentally probabilistic, but for any actual mental decisions and things at human scale they fundamentally aren't probabilistic and are predictable. Similarly unpredictable numerous potential neuron states does not mean unpredictable decisions or actions. Also human action is fundamentally highly highly predictable in many ways, our inability to predict things does not mean they are unpredictable.

The debate throughout the period between 1+2 was whether or not Heidegger was actually affiliated with Nazi ideas or if this was all done as way to control the school for the sake of philosophical purity. Defenses of the latter were the standard for a long time (it was what I was taught in undergrad), which is why we see attempts to actually take him to task when few actually did.\n\nThe first wave of Jewish students (and contemporaries) of Heidegger had vastly different takes on his Nazism. All were hurt, and all were affected for a long time after. Levinas' break with Heidegger resulted in a longstanding campaign to undermine the whole of his philosophy, primarily on the basis of a single omission in *Being and Time*: a foundation for Dasein's ethical relation with others. It is mentioned as a structural component by H. (*mitsein*) but is so flagrantly confusing regarding the import of the Other that it could go in a number of contradicting directions including a devaluation. This is just one example, see also Arendt, Marcuse, Paul de Mann, etc. \n\nThe next generation after this were students like Derrida and Foucault who were reluctant adherents. Derrida was far more vocal about his use of Heidegger in texts, which led him eventually to contend with Heidegger's Nazism in the book *Of Spirit: Heidegger and the Question*. No one since has done more to point to *hidden* elements of Heidegger's latent \"nationalism\" (particularly in terms of Heidegger's adherence to a German *Volksgeist*) than this work. There are sections that show Derrida's brilliance as a *reader* of texts, and his ability to justifiably deploy hauntology and trace as legitimate critical lenses which completely outshine efforts for later critiques that attempt to pinpoint fascism as an open conclusion in *Being and Time*, for example. (Ex. Why does Heidegger go out of his way NOT to mention Geist, when he is clearly grappling with Hegel?) BUT the most salient moment in the text is Derrida's warning that witch hunts for the hidden Nazis are evidence that the Nazi lives on in us as well. (Think Nietzsche's \"abyss gazes back\" and \"becoming the monster\" quotes.) I think this has a lasting effect in Continental theory in a silent absorption that leads to the next generation of Heidegger renunciations . . .\n\nWithin the past decade or so, even before the release of the *Schwazen Hefte* there were a number of critics of Heidegger who advanced the notions drawn in the article, that Heidegger's philosophy (generally speaking) is a gateway to Nazism. The primary advocate of this view was Emmanuel Faye followed shortly after by Richard Wolin and Peter Trawney.  Trawney came out after being one of the scholars tasked with reading\/translating the Black Notebooks, and it was clear from his frontline reports that the outlook was not good. We learned that Heidegger definitely had deeply-held antisemitic views, and, at times, said very favorable things about Hitler. There are undeniable connections made between his philosophy and antisemitism in those books that he wanted people to see. So, Heidegger was, undeniably, a Nazi and the fact that he never repented is just further evidence of his narcissist self-aggrandizement (imo).\n\nThat said, I was taught Heidegger from Germans who lived through the post-War and Cold War eras in Germany. These are folks who had Nazi family members, and who bore shame on the world stage as a nation of perpetrators of the most inexcusably heinous acts ever witnessed in living memory. Their view of Heidegger was that he was a broken, pathetic, and arrogant dick. BUT what he did in philosophy, perhaps these glimmers of brilliance despite himself, can be useful for aims that he would absolutely hate. So, if we can spin him in his grave fast enough, all that will be left are the ashes . . . \n\nMeanwhile, this obsession with outing the hidden Nazi, racist, or scoundrel somehow goes uncritiqued . . . I see this far too rarely amongst better scholars. Derrida warned us about the effects, that to be on a constant witch hunt to name the next pariah is to move far closer to the spirit of Nazism than away from it. Meanwhile, Heidegger's confessors continue to make their names off of his work, whether they deny it or not.","upvotes":125,"created_utc":1678375009.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":60,"created_utc":1678369912.0},{"author":"jthatche","text":"I guess of slight interest is that Alexander Dugin is a scholar of Heideggarian thought and uses his concepts to ground and justify his \u201cforth political theory.\u201d In fact, many on the far right or even ultra right turn again and again to Heidegger for inspiration and a deeper understanding of what it is to be human and, more importantly, what form of politics should be embraced on the basis of that understanding. \n\nI think the relevant question is then: is the philosophy Heidegger, regardless of his personal beliefs, merely necessary for an ultra right political philosophy (that is, the assumptions and concepts propounded by Heidegger inform the politic in the same way that Plato informed Catholicism) or, is Heideggers thought bound up with ultra right politic in a way that it can not be separated and is in fact the spiritual and intellectual aspect of that form of politic. \n\nI really can\u2019t get a clear grip on an answer and wondering what others think about this.","upvotes":59,"created_utc":1678361563.0},{"author":"Broad_Judgment_523","text":"Philosophy novice here - so please don't murder me.

His modern impact is more linked into academics he influenced that were contemporary linked to him and as a subject of history of ideas. His significance has waned overtime. \n\nHis philosophy generated interesting analysis of certain things. throwness is interesting but flawed, but I really enjoy the a posteriori emergence of knowledge of tools through immersion and repetition, turning items from present-at-hand to ready-to-hand through engagement with a thing defining our expectations of tools and how we interact with them defines what the tool is and the fact those activities have a reflective property to our identity and self. That idea was driven even better by Sartre in being and nothingness when talking about social roles influencing ourselves (again another problematic character). I found that Heideggers analysis of tools interesting and  more convincing than pure logic driven attempts to explain those phenomenon and engagements. last I checked my honing and appreciation of knife skills I\u2019ve gained from years of cooking have effected my life and social choices in a tangible way but haven\u2019t driven me to celebrate national socialism. Still his philosophy has limited personal impact other than that.

His argument, insofar as I can follow it (no genius here) is fudging that boundary in an unpleasant way.\n\nThe only thing that can alter the truth is action.  If I take all the butter out of the fridge, it renders the entire earlier question a matter of historic truth rather than existential truth.  It invalidates no part of past fridge butter.  Present truth is what it is, there is no butter.  Historical truth is what it is, there was butter..  Again, this is something this fellow is playing fast and loose with in an unpleasant way.\n\nIf the goal of the pursuit of knowledge is to obtain the truth, which I believe it is, then we need to separate the theory of truth from the theory of knowledge, which this dude appears not to be doing.\n\nIn fact, I believe \"the truth is what exists, or existed in a given timeframe, regardless of whether it is known\" is pretty much axiomatic, and blows this guy's sophistries out of the water.","upvotes":14,"created_utc":1678337241.0},{"author":"IAI_Admin","text":"After a career spent in the pursuit of truth, Simon Blackburn explains how the deflationist approach, one which demonstrates why there's nothing to say about truth, changed his mind. While truth may be found to correspond to facts, many philosophers agree that correspondence in itself cannot account for a theory of truth. We can try instead to assess truth in light of other things we believe to be true, meaning that fundamentally truth is coherence across all beliefs. But coherence does not exclude the possibility of falsity \u2013 we can easily conceive of coherent stories that are nonetheless fictional. An alternative approach is pragmatism, which supposes that truth is that which is useful, but this view also fails to capture the essence of truth as it cannot be guaranteed that what one finds useful has any valid relation to reality. Therefore, the question \u201cwhat is truth?\u201d ends up dissolving into another: \u201cwhat are you interested in finding out?\u201d Such an account renders the word \u2018truth\u2019 redundant, since saying something is true does not bring any new information to what had already been stated.","upvotes":10,"created_utc":1678292728.0},{"author":"Koda_20","text":"I love the deflationist approach.

You mention Schopenhaur, but you could even take it a step further with Nietzsche!\n\n**Sartre's Bad faith**: Shinji chooses not to act because he's afraid of the responsibility of freedom, but denies his refusal to act by claiming he's powerless. Asuka gets Shinji to 'act out' a kiss because she has some level of emotional attachment or attraction she doesn't want to address. Misato realizes the cruelty of forcing children to go through war and her role in it, as well the acknowledgement that she could refuse to force the children, but rejects the responsibility by claiming she's following orders and then attempting to act like a parent. Gendo attempting to bring about Instrumentality is a way for him to avoid the responsibility and knowledge that he is still a being capable of love, and what he 'owes' Shinji as a father.\n\n**Sartre's Gaze**: So much of this show involves Gaze, the fear that comes from being objectified by another and having the totality of your existence reduced to a single facet *as well as* people using Gaze to promote images of themselves. Asuka has basically spent her entire life trying to use Gaze to convince everyone (including herself) that she's an excellent pilot and thus deserving of love. Rei, primarily in Rebuild, concerns herself with trying to 'appear' and thus *be* human like others by attempting to mimic the proper affect. Shinji has spent his whole dang life being subject to the Gaze of others, especially Gendo and Asuka in multiple situations where his humanity has been reduced to his ability\/willingness to pilot an EVA.\n\n**Heidegger's Anxiety and Dasein**: \"A human being is an existence that is aware of its own awareness,\" is a simplified example of how he describes Dasein - a Being that is capable of contemplating its own existence with the ability to shape that existence with the knowledge it will one day end. Dasein is a being that can experience Anxiety, the temporary disruption of everyday existence in the Fallen word in which an individual must choose how to live their life and create meaning in the face of the knowledge they will one day die. And they must choose whether to become Authentic by creating their own set of values or return to Fallenness by letting themselves be absorbed by (in Shinji and Gendo's case, music as well as) everyday living.\n\nShinji and Gendo (as revealed in the Rebuilds) are both individuals who experience frequent bouts of Anxiety, but in their youth they reject Authenticity and Fall into just doing everyday tasks without care and isolating themselves because that's easier than being Authentic. Shinji's attempts to *be* Authentic, to choose for himself what he desires and how to live his life are what lead to his departure from NERV (after he tries to destroy it) and the (partially realized) Third Impact of the Rebuilds - and eventually the decision to remake the world.\n\n**Kierkegaard's Either\/Or**: There's a whole section in Either\/Or about how choice is required of living beings, how personality can be crafted from choice or subsumed when the individual refuses to choose out of the belief that regret is inevitable. In addition, the section includes how an individual who rejects choice while living attempts to delude themselves into thinking both options remain available, but in so doing only makes himself miserable. This is Shinji (and Gendo when he was younger). He rejected the act of choosing for himself because he doesn't really have goals or desires, because he's not Authentic, and in so doing ends up in a lot of bad scenarios or ends up acting impulsively and seemingly without reason because he thinks his actions will always end in regret.\n\n**Nietzsche:** There's so much potential here, the aphorism about how being loved can be disgusting or unsettling because the person being loved is full of self-loathing (Shinji, Gendo); because they see themselves as unlovable. The idea that every philosophy (and anime) is an attempt for the author to justify their own existence and that 'all writing is done in \\[the\\] blood \\[of the writer\\]', (Anno's 'journey' through depression). The idea that being known by another, and their attempt to understand is painful because understanding and empathy are their own forms of suffering (the hedgehog's dilemma and why Gendo\/Shinji\/Asuka\/Misato put up so many emotional barriers).\n\nThe entire dang series could be seen as a promise\/threat of Eternal Recurrence and the problem of Nihilism. Shinji and Gendo have built their lives on a basis of fear and rejection of life, a desire to never do any of it again, a rejection of pain and in its essence life itself - they become Nihilistic in a negative sense seeking only the end. Kaworu accepts the pain because of the love and joy it enables, he accepts life, and has **literally** lived his life repeatedly without end (until 3.0+1.0) in pursuit of helping Shinji learn how to do the same - Kaworu recognizes that while there is no definite objective meaning in the universe, meaning can still exist and creates\/seeks his own. It is **only** in 3.0+1.0 after Shinji learns how to accept his life, to accept life and wish to do it all over again, to will the Eternal Recurrence, that he becomes able to literally break into a new reality. And the idea that acts can exist beyond good and evil (especially when they come from 'love') comes up repeatedly, it's why Shinji tries to save Rei and causes the partial Third Impact, it's the idea behind Gendo's pursuit of Instrumentality, it's why Kaworu spends who knows how many lifetimes trying to save Shinji.\n\nEven after *all* of this, there's **still** stuff - just in the authors presented here - that could be further explored.","upvotes":26,"created_utc":1678095806.0},{"author":null,"text":"[deleted]","upvotes":21,"created_utc":1678054935.0},{"author":"Hideo-Mogren","text":"[https:\/\/twitter.com\/petsuchan\/status\/1330285942658248711](https:\/\/twitter.com\/petsuchan\/status\/1330285942658248711) The iconic Angel explosions are a reference to a 1937 film.","upvotes":13,"created_utc":1678049907.0},{"author":"gerryw173","text":"Imagine if English teachers got their hands on Evangelion","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1678060249.0},{"author":"Skyreaper71","text":"Philosophy can manifest in any form of art or media.

(Depending on the power structure involved. If someone has power over another, it means they may not have the agency to walk away. Power-to, power-with, power-within also exist and can change how much agency the \"players\" have.)\n\nWith human interactions, I find choosing trustworthy, re-humanizing behaviors that build secure attachment, actually build secure attachment over time (shocker!). Whereas, untrustworthy, dehumanizing, behaviors are disconnecting and destroy secure attachment (aka devolve into *normalized* abuse, neglect, and dehumanization - for example, emotional neglect is normalized and widespread across the globe). I continue to interact with others that choose trustworthy re-humanizing behaviors and I stop interacting with people that choose untrustworthy, dehumanizing behaviors as the patterns emerge.\n\nThese are the trust metrics I use:\n\n[The Trust Triangle](https:\/\/youtu.be\/pVeq-0dIqpk) - authenticity, empathy, logic (what we say and how we say it)\n\n[The Anatomy of Trust](https:\/\/brenebrown.com\/videos\/anatomy-trust-video\/) - marble jar concept and BRAVING acronym\n\n[10 definitions of objectifying\/dehumanizing behaviors](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Objectification#Definitions) - these erode trust\n\nI take each trust metric and ask myself:\n\nAm I allowing others to be authentic? Are they allowing me to be authentic? (aka no racism, sexism, homophobia, etc)\n\nAm I being empathetic towards myself and others? Are they reciprocating empathy or are they being abusive, neglectful, and dehumanizing?\n\nAre they using logic, science, data, etc, or are they lying, being coercive, manipulative, etc? (No verbal abuse, emotional abuse, no coercive control, etc)\n\nAm I setting and respecting reasonable boundaries? Does the other person respect boundaries or do they need to be protected from bc they ignore boundaries?\n\nEtc, down the line through all twenty trust metrics.\n\nI had to escape an abusive family and culture of origin. My perspectives on trust are heavily biased by my experiences in the world, having endured child abuse. I needed guidelines for which behaviors actuality build trust bc I had terrible examples to compare to. And most people say they're trustworthy, and choose untrustworthy behaviors on the regular. Often it's unsafe to be authentic bc of the implication of \"or else!\" The toxic system feigns \"niceness\" as long as you conform. As soon as you do something they don't like (aka don't take the abuse like a good little prisoner) the implied threat of \"or else!\" kicks in, sometimes literally. The toxic person\/group will then abuse, neglect, and dehumanize the target to coerce them back into the toxic rules of the system. In many cases, the safest option is to stay quiet, fly under the radar, and plot an exit strategy. Abusers aren't gonna change, and they most definitely don't play fair or act in good faith. The only thing we can do is separate ourselves from them. It's like war games. When it comes to abusers, the only way to win is not to play. If the people with positional power are the abusers, well leave that group, plot an escape, go undercover and underground. It's a waste of time, energy, and effort to engage an abuser.\n\nBooks on attachment theory - what helps us thrive as human mammals, and communication skills\/strategies:\n\n\"Becoming Attached - first relationships and how they shape our capacity to love\" by Robert Karen.

She does this to supplement her \"primary concern\", because the \"primary concern\" is not enough, it needs an (unspoken) \"secondary concern\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\n **Paragraph four:** \n\nHer thesis starts of with: \n\n>\u017di\u017eek is not engaging in some semiotic analysis of the arguments surrounding the recent political controversy around trans rights in Scotland, nor is he truly linking them to much else.\n\nBut he does. Just not towards her preferred ideological stance. It is what she takes later offense on as transphobic. He plays with the ideas sleep\/wake\/woke, he plays with the taboo topic of \"the woman with the penis\", he plays with pronounce. He quotes McWhorter on contradicting statements to and imagined from the big Other.  \n\nHer claim that he does not link it too much else, I want to refute here. Identity politics, partisan politics in UK and US, academia as a public sphere vs. a private sphere, universality, the assumptions we have about \"what we all are\" and \"what is\" are complexe questions\/problems. \n\nShe again invokes the big Other: \n\n> \u017di\u017eek has fallen for the panic surrounding trans healthcare that has seemed to infect the entirety of liberal intelligentsia in the past decade.\n\n Which sets her apart from the panic.

There is no definitive conclusion for either \"side\" (for or against). It is possible that the medical approaches to medical transitioning are inherently flawed (and therefore different methodes need to be researched). \n\nAs far as I can see Zizeks article does not claim that cross-sex hormones were given to people under 16. \n\nHere she makes an ideological backed claim for which she provides no proof.

His insistence on misgendering Bryson, first simply as \u2018he\u2019 and then more troublingly as \u2018it,\u2019 suggests that \u017di\u017eek sees respecting trans identity as something discretionary and contingent on good behavior. \u017di\u017eek is, in this article and to put it lightly, transphobic.\n\nThe portion where Zizek has made such statements, it didn't allow them to look past that 'dishonesty' as they call it and so preferred to highlight those misgivings rather than attempt to build their own narrative, to clarify how this relates to policy, and how it'd be better than what Zizek is suggesting. The latter was a tougher task so it's always easier to shoot down the argument anyway.\n\nI partly agree with the charge that this was a lazy attempt and maybe even a disarray of random thoughts that were all trying to fit in. The article could have been more condensed because I actually think it's the reverse; Zizek glossed over multiple examples in a half-hearted manner with the assumption that the reader will have known them, but actually just a couple of those references would have sufficed to make his point, and he has done it quite well, especially the ending. It's strikingly resemblant to a few Upanishadic teachings on dreams.\n\nWhat the author sees as troubling is actually from what I could understand is Zizek's way of highlighting the dubious ways of Isla during the case. What should have been purely about the atrocity committed by a *human*, the focus shifted towards identity and respect and the author prefers to cater to this. So Zizek's harshness is more about bringing to light this aspect and given that the shameful act was indeed committed, for a moment one could look past the gender play here and recognize the need for a proper judgement aside of personal preferences that evolved *during* the case.\n\nThis is not a case of Zizek being unclear at least, the article is simply the realization on the part of the author, that Zizek is much more crazier than I ever thought, and that disturbs my personal view of what I thought Zizek had been implying all this time. So the author's anger is justified really, but misdirected. Their anger is on themself actually.\n\nThe issue I understand though was Scotland's handling of it and the new policy that [came up](https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/isla-bryson-trans-woman-convicted-rape-scotland-prison-sentenced\/),\n\n>The case sparked a change in policy in Scotland so that \"any newly convicted or remanded transgender prisoner will initially be placed in an establishment commensurate with their birth gender.\n\nBut nevertheless, it is evidently clear as to what Zizek is focusing on and that does not necessarily point to disrespecting trans identity as such. Of course Isla couldn't have controlled the period of transition, but then it'd also be naive for someone to not consider the possibility that this did indeed help Isla's case to somehow bring in the 'woke' culture to her rescue to try and lessen the impact on her tarnished image. Perhaps they were hoping that'd it would influence the sentence as well. Like the author wishes to hop on without clarifying what her policy stance is.\n\nAnyway, as an Indian I could relate highly with some of Zizek's points here given that there is a need to discuss caste based discrimination in Indian circles and whenever attempts are made to present objective data and re-look history without the colonial lens, tensions flare up and people resort to my way or highway and prioritize feelings over actually finding ways to focus on understanding commonalities and all of Zizek's examples were spot-on, especially activist Maryam's incident which is brushed off as insignificant. Almost something exactly similar happened in the Hijab case in the last 2 years - how religious organizations sprung to defend the choice of women apparently, when it is indoctrination at best with little to no choice for a girl child in Islam, so very applicable unlike what the author says, but in a different context.\n\n>The black woke elite is fully aware it won\u2019t achieve its declared goal of diminishing black oppression\u2014and it doesn\u2019t even want that. What they really want is what they are achieving: a position of moral authority from which they may terrorize all others, without effectively changing social relations of domination.\n\nThis is to the point. Some of the oppressed communities in India too rightly protest about this but many events off late have indeed confirmed that they are aligning with literally anybody eg., Khalistanis and other separatists to sort of literally avenge the past and also falsely glorify the atrocities committed to further trigger the masses rather than focus on resolving what can be done now with pragmatic understandings and dialogue over honest acceptance of what actually transpired. But historians who have been proven to be literally wrong through primary sources are still used as weapons to hurl, furthering casteist notions when actually it began to solve them.\n\nAnyway this deviated, but news is that Zizek is well and kicking, maybe a little more insensitive than usual, which is not uncommon, and yet still makes some great points.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1677989616.0},{"author":"kiothebest","text":"You guys were still taking Zizek serious?","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1678133934.0},{"author":"heyomgsareda","text":"People just think he's smart because he spits every 10 seconds","upvotes":0,"created_utc":1677980860.0},{"author":"corpus-luteum","text":"The page is blocked for Phishing.

But here\u2019s where they really lost me:\n\n> Since sometimes the creeps should be felt and conveyed, extirpation of the fitting creeps can be both morally inappropriate and also itself creepy insofar as it undermines emotional barriers to becoming a creep. Public relations efforts designed to help children overcome their unease about eating animals\u2014such as clowns who promote eating hamburgers, cartoon cows who urge us to eat chickens, and language that obscures the link between what kids find on their plates and the living animals they adore (e.g., \u201cpork,\u201d not \u201cpigs\u201d)\u2014are especially creepy, being akin to propaganda designed to extinguish our moral repulsion to racist or xenophobic atrocities.\n\n> Inculcation of the creeps can also be morally inappropriate when the emotion is unfitting. For example, anti-abortion activists often portray abortion as creepy. A newspaper article about efforts to close Kentucky\u2019s only abortion clinic quotes an observer who describes anti-abortion protests as follows: \u201cThere are the Catholics who stand vigil, saying the rosary while lining both sides of the sidewalk to create an \u2018eerie and disconcerting\u2019 gauntlet for patients to run\u201d (Smith 2017). Such theatrics aim to instill the creeps about abortion clinics but are themselves creepy. For, seeking or providing an abortion (even if it is wrong) is not evidence of moral insensitivity, since people typically give the matter serious moral consideration. However, regarding people who seek or provide abortions as *necessarily* morally insensitive is itself badly morally mistaken.\n\nIt\u2019s not that I disagree with people who find eating meat to be morally incorrect, and abortion to be a rightful part of family planning (personally, I have no dog in either fight), but this seems to be a very sectarian way of understanding creepiness. And it points to a very left-leaning understanding of creepiness as directly related to social injustice and oppression, which the authors seem to understand as objective moral truths, rather than aspects of society that change over time.\n\nI can completely understand a viewpoint that posits that \u201cregarding people who seek or provide abortions as *necessarily* morally insensitive\u201d is legitimate, regardless of whether or not I understand said viewpoint to be an accurate one. The authors do nothing to support the idea that unborn children cannot legitimately be considered to have the same rights that they ascribe to animals.\n\nAnd in the end, this is what undermines their argument. it\u2019s all well and good to say that a \u201ccreep\u201d has violated some objective moral norm, and has thus earned the negative emotion directed at them. But to then wrap that in the Culture Wars, as we experience them here in the United States, seems to enlist the enterprise as a sectarian weapon, something which no-one needs more of.\n\nSide note: For the record: \u201clanguage that obscures the link between what kids find on their plates and the living animals they adore\u201d such as \u201cpork\u201d versus \u201cpigs,\u201d \u201ccows\u201d versus \u201cbeef,\u201d \u201cdeer\u201d versus \u201cvenison\u201d and \u201csheep\u201d versus \u201cmutton,\u201d are the nearly thousand-year old legacy of the Norman conquest of England. The words for the animals come from the English of the time, who often did the farming\/hunting, and the words for the meat come from the French, who were the wealthy people who could afford to eat it.

A creepy person is the sort of person you think might creep up on you with ill-intent if given the chance. Violating moral norms is therefore certainly one way to be creepy, but in fact violating social norms of the non-moral variety will do the same thing. It's why homeless people  alternately muttering and yelling to themselves on a subway car are so creepy - there is nothing *immoral* about either muttering to yourself or yelling at yourself, but doing so violates social convention, and if they will violate one social convention, who knows what other ones they might decide to break.","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1677884457.0},{"author":"ADefiniteDescription","text":"**ABSTRACT**:\n\n> Creepiness and the emotion of the creeps have been overlooked in the moral philosophy and moral psychology literatures.

Not of the deity, the history, or any tangible evidence, but in any circumstantial evidence that some positive effect had occurred.\n\nFor each religion they each have different beliefs as well as different standards for what is seen as positive or what they are optimising for (Christians for less theft or murder, sex,  theft or Buddhist for less attachment or happiness).\n\nIt wasn't perfect data, nor was it perfectly scientific though it could be repeated with much more diligence.\n\nWhen I finished it, the conclusion that there is either no correlation, or negative correlation (Christians have highest theft, rape and murder rate for example) and that behaviour or known correlation from scientific known causes had a near perfect match, while I just couldn't find any evidence of any force other than behavioural or geographic. \n\nI.E. A Christian in a quake prone area still got quakes. Muslims who become a doctor earn more. \n\nBehaviour and culture had the biggest impact (Protestants and Shinto work very hard and earn more). \n\nI looked to see first, for any observable benefit, especially if \"prayers were answered\" as markers, eg\n\nAverage life span (Shinto, Buddhist) \n\nCancer remission rate (when culture, eg smoking levels this had no observable difference, Atheists lived longest possibly by leaning on science) \n\nHeart attacks and Strokes. No noticeable impact other than stress levels. Prayer has been shown to drop blood pressure, and this can be reproduced from sitting quietly and meditating or being mindful. \n\nIncome or wealth (Jewish did well in this, and when you look at behaviours, it is work hard for a skill, save and invest, when you account for that, this seems habits based) \n\nHappiness (Buddhist) Scandinavian countries and European, and this correlates with high atheist levels. \n\nIQ (Shinto, Atheist, Jewish. Lower is Christianity, esp Mormon and Jehovah witness were lowest IQ)\n\nPoverty (some pockets for Christianity esp Catholic, and also some for Muslim though for much of this, it can be that psychologically it can feel better to have a religion, and missionaries have gone to locations where poverty is)\n\nTeen pregnancy (this isn't a bad thing per se - but it is for Christians, and is a tracker for sexual activity, and it can contribute to poverty).\nChristians were highest for this, and where a chastity sex ed approach is pushed, this figure, STIs and abortions rise sharply. Catholics are also very high on this, as they don't condone condom use)\n\nOverall death by disease this is much higher for cancer for spiritual people or Christian science, who ignore chemo. \n\nCovid is an outlier as Christians \/ Republicans had a very strong anti vaccine and mask approach and died about 7x to 20x higher rates. The US in particular were much, much worse, and Eastern religions did better, but this basically had a very strong correlation to govt rules and population behaviour. There was a huge number of super spreader events due to church and I could see no protection afforded from prayer or belief. Atheists win this by a lot. \n\nExtreme weather events\nThis correlates to geographic locations eg Christians who left Britain started experiencing the weather that had previously been experienced by Native American religions after they went to the USA.

I think it's dangerous or unhelpful when people derive sense of superiority from it and it has driven many wars and persecution.\n\nBut a scientific, caring, civic minded approach, as well as good govt policy, good citizens and wealth seems a stark winner for any possible metric I could find. \n\nI chose to stay agnostic and I have picked up some of the Buddhist meditation and detachment beliefs as they had evidence for them.","upvotes":8,"created_utc":1677694151.0},{"author":"Gurgoth","text":"It is important for religions to create a safe spot for their diety.

So the limitations of logic itself is not being used to exemplify that there is a transcendental essence that is being missed by our deficiencies, but rather that what can be discerned here through logic is simply what matters.

For this I will make a number list.\n\n1. There was a section of the article claiming that something couldn't be because it would  be bad. \"For it\u2019s not just that Wittgenstein believes that no empirical evidence is, in actual fact, available, it\u2019s rather that even if, per impossible, it could be available, this would not be a good thing, but would rather \u2018destroy the whole business.\" Now, I realize they say in this statement that it's impossible, but bringing up the idea that it would 'not be good' is just illogical. That's not an argument, it's a opinion. Which should not show up in an article of science.\n2. Their reasoning for not treating the existence of God as science. \"The problem with this is that, if someone holds that religious beliefs ought to be assessed by the \u2018modern scientific criteria\u2019 (as Swinburne, who shares O\u2019Hara\u2019s view, once put it), then they must be prepared to hold their beliefs to the same exacting standards of empirical corroboration and falsification as employed in science.\" Which if anyone does truly hold a belief in God, than they should have no problem with this. Holding a belief means to believe in something no matter what. If a belief can't hold against fact, than it is false and shouldn't be believed in. \n3. Their definition(s) of God. \" On such a conception, there would only be a quantitative difference between being God and a human being (that is, the former would only differ from the latter in respect to how much more of certain properties \u2013 such as powers \u2013 this entity has), there would not be a qualitative distinction\" The conception in this quote was if there was evidence for God and that God was provable by an empirical approach. Which, of course, the idea that God being provable makes him no different from a human is illogical and baseless. God is by definition a supreme *being.* Meaning he's similar to humans, but there is a very large difference between the two. \n4. They are going completely on the thought that God is improvable. \"It makes no sense to think that one could find information about the \u2018kingdom of heaven\u2019 in a geography book \u2013 as Kierkegaard ironically puts it \u2013 or make God \u2018observable\u2019 by means of an electron microscope.\" Even if God wasn't provable, that would be based off of current means. It would also mean that God was in all likely disprovable. Either way you look at it. Stating that it makes no sense without evidence is unscientific and lacking reason.\n\nNow, there are other issues I had with the article, but these are the main ones and I'm tired of typing.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1677731338.0},{"author":"moschles","text":"> Doing so will help one recognise why contemporary debates around religion, like the one surrounding the so-called new atheists, mistakenly conflate religion with other practices, like science.\n\nExcept the new atheists literally do not do this.

Miracles for instance are supposedly events in physical reality which would require evidence. Similarly any beliefs in a 6000 year old world are obvious nonsense.

Thus evidence cannot be dismissed as irrelevant to the question of God.\n\nAny idea of God which we can argue to be necessary and thus that we may have a justified belief in is also abstract and impersonal. Things like personality and will are already assumptions. A God flooding the earth, hurling thunder, being angry, needing worship, raising the dead, etc. is pagan superstition.\n\nAny true religion ought to be arrived at through logic and be a necessary metaphysical conclusion.

It's more useful to consider a conversation to be a synchronisation process between two persons (or more than two, or one\/several persons and a boundary object, i.e. interface).\n\nThoughts are not encoded as words. Words are generated essentially as GPT does it. There is a % probability of using a particular word, you can go into many directions. There is only a weak correlation between a resulting text and what the person wants to convey. Also, it's not like there is a single goal - to convey a particular fact. It's easy to assume that and it may be useful in a theoretization context, but in reality there are many motivations. Even just to avoid the akward silence.\n\nOne can use sentences to encode information formatlly. However, usually we do not do that. Examples of when we do - google Object\u2212Process Methodology. But normal language is not like that. There is more structure and intent to a long text\/conversation than to a particular sentence. We can analyse a sentence, we can't have a similar understanding of a long text.\n\nI believe it's much better to think about conversations in a new way. Imagine each participant (and the interface) has a mental model. A mental model can be (for simplicity) assumed to have form of objects + relations. Relations can be processes, btw. So different participants have different graphs in their minds. Then they exchange pieces of conversation (which can take many forms) to sync parts of the model. The participants may not realise they are doing that, the process is more akin to syncing of metronomes on the same surface or of people clapping together. If mental models of different participants are too different (because \"domains of discourse\" are two different or for other reasons), then there is no sync. If, however, there are some shared concepts or ideas, sync may happen. If people converge, then they may get to a shared mental model.\n\nWhen this happens through spoken language, this basically doesn't work or barely works, because executive memory is very small and people can keep just 3-4 objects in the focus of their attention. Using boundary objects (interfaces, exocortex) is potentially much more effecitve. Using special methods of discourse (protocols) can be very powerful too. Finding a way to avoid emotional and social traps is a great enhancer as well.","upvotes":0,"created_utc":1677693361.0},{"author":"tomriddlegiggles","text":"the unconscious is the discourse of the other especially when examining the signifier and unconscious. \n\n-\ttaken from j lacan","upvotes":-1,"created_utc":1677658442.0},{"author":"DarthBigD","text":"a four year old know this","upvotes":-1,"created_utc":1677701295.0}]},{"title":"How Mathematics Can Make a Difference","author":"ADefiniteDescription","url":"https:\/\/quod.lib.umich.edu\/p\/phimp\/3521354.0017.003\/--how-mathematics-can-make-a-difference?view=image","text":"","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677700419.0,"comments":[{"author":"ReaperX24","text":"Absolutely. Don't see any reason why that wouldn't be the case. As far as I can imagine, any entity or process in the universe could ultimately be abstracted into a mathematical computation of some form.\n\nWell, maybe not whatever it is that forms the link between our subjective, conscious experience with the objective universe, but that's mainly because the whole notion is more or less incoherent to us, at this stage. This may always be the greatest mystery of our universe, rivaled only by the question of why and how anything exists at all to begin with.\n\nIf I'm being honest, I've been taking a more serious look at the philosophical spectrum that considers these two inquiries to be fundamentally linked - if not entirely identical. From our perspective, as human beings, I just can't shake the spookiness of the apparent fact that an infinite volume of spacetime never was and seemingly never will be witnessed by any conscious being, let alone a being with the necessary cognitive ability to conceptualise it and assign some sort of meaning to it. Even if we assume intelligent life is fairly abundant, and that we simply failed to discover any, that's still an infinitesimal value, in relative terms.\n\nI fully acknowledge that this obsession with the ability to witness events and conceptualise them, into stories that we tell ourselves, may be little more than an artifact of our primate brains - an artifact which may mean absolutely nothing from the perspective of the universe at large. And I also get that the relative scarcity of conscious life was *[probably]* always the most likely scenario from a purely probabilistic viewpoint, but I still find the situation we find ourselves in to be spectaculary spooky.\n\nHow on earth is it possible for existence to manufacture its own existence, and why in the name of hell do we find ourselves here, gladly taking part in what appears to be existence's *[likely futile]* quest to answer that question. Why is it so hard for us to just let go of all that grandiosity and move on to more productive pleasures.\n\nConsider putting your tinfoil hats on for a moment and allow yourselves to entertain the notion that we could be little more than cogs in an elaborate mechanism that, in some sense, has a will of its own. This bends my fucking mind, every single time.\n\nFor clarity, I'm not at all suggesting a 'supernatural' being nor any kind of physical entity, just a formless algorithm of some sort. This doesn't suggest that the design has actual libertarian free will, either - IMO, any world view that indicates the existence of real free will, in any way, is a nonsensical one. Fucking with causality never seems to result in anything coherent, so we might as well presume that it's truly fundamental. At the bare minimum, we could describe causality as our mind's abstraction of a fundemental property of existence itself. The idea which I proposed in the previous paragraph takes it one step further and applies that line of thinking to mathematics.\n\nI don't think this hypothesis is strongly evident or anything, but it's not *that* wild of a take relative to the beliefs of your average person, tbh.\n\nEdit: Ehm, excuse the largely off-topic tangent. Got a little bit too excited and ended up maneuvering this wild ride off the rails. Was planning to swing back to the actual subject of discussion, but then I figured that I had probably already went on for long enough. However, I did add one last bit that clarifies my point, while also loosely connecting it all back to the original subject.","upvotes":9,"created_utc":1677710852.0},{"author":"ADefiniteDescription","text":"**ABSTRACT**:\n\n> Standard approaches to counterfactuals in the philosophy of explanation are geared toward causal explanation.

The author councils against compelling people to work but offers no alternatives for how those people who won\u2019t work are to attain the basic human necessities of food and shelter. \n\nWorking hard is absolutely essentially. Working smart is also essential. \n\nBut not working at all is a death sentence for a society.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1677524158.0},{"author":"InTheEndEntropyWins","text":"&#x200B;\n\n>People are realising that many jobs simply aren\u2019t worth the effort\n\nIsn't this the argument used by the right to say benefits are way too high and easily accessed  leady to people being too lazy to work. This isn't for free, there isn't a magic money tree, hence it's those people working who have to fund those benefits.\n\n>But there are no easy solutions short of questioning whether human progress and prosperity should rely on human labour\n\nIt's not like there is a choice here. Currently human labour is behind building houses, coding your apps, etc. It's not like people work to \"make them happy\", it's to be a productive part of society. Society just would fall apart if people just did labour that made them happy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I think you should be uncomfortable with the fact that you live in a system that compels you to have a job,\n\nAs far as I'm aware pretty much every workable and even most unworkable systems would \"compel\" people to work. From a self sufficiency type model, you'd need to get your own food and build your own shelter. Even communist systems would compel people to work, maybe even to a greater degree.\n\nSo I'm confused about what they are even suggesting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>particularly if that job is neither necessary for your own well-being nor the well-being of others.\n\nCan someone give an example of a job that doesn't increase the well-being of someone? Surely in a capitalist economy jobs that didn't eventually result in some value would be phased out. Why bother paying someone to do something that doesn't provide value?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Thanks to advances in robotics and AI, we may be close to building a society in which work, as we currently know it, is no longer necessary for either of these things.\n\nJust imagine the things people could do using robotics and AI. Imagine the amazing apps, arts, etc. people could create using these tools. But no they are suggesting that people just sit on their asses and waste such opportunities.\n\n>It\u2019s not that there is no place for determined effort, self-improvement and ambition in the well-lived life. Mastering skills, making a contribution to one\u2019s society, and achieving goals are all key elements of the good life. They are also, as the philosophers Anca Gheaus and Lisa Herzog point out, things that are made possible through paid employment. But is the workplace really the best place to pursue such ends?\n\nFor the vast majority of people, yes it is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"Enough of this. We are being sold a myth. Internalising the work ethic is not the gateway to a better life; it is a trap.\"\n\nThis seems like such a toxic statement and mindset.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>We are being sold a myth.\n\nI'm often soo happy I think I am living in a dream. I worked hard at school and worked to get into a role I love. Maybe my life is mythically good.\n\n>But...the reality of work, for most people, is far from ideal\n\nI think articles like this will lead to more of that. Rather than encouraging people to work hard and to enjoy their job, it's doing the opposite.\n\nI feel like a good attitude is almost a cheat code in life, work in any job is soo much better with a good attitude. With bad attitudes almost any job is going to such.\n\n>But we should question whether compelling humans to work is essential to the continuation of that progress.\n\nSure if we don't want society to progress and just let it stagnate then, then sure we can have more people just lazing about doing nothing. But if we want to see an explosion in the quality of life then we want people working and exploiting the latest technology.

It states that things that are intentionally harmful are seen as immoral, and crucially, that things that are immoral are seen as harmful.  There is hard data to back up this assertion:\n\n[https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/10.1177\/1088868317698288#fig3-1088868317698288](https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/10.1177\/1088868317698288#fig3-1088868317698288)\n\nThis shows that perceptions of harm and perceptions of immorality, of a particular topic, match up closely.\n\nThe definition of harm is extended from harm to the person, to harm to other things like society or abstract principles.\n\nThe Theory of Dyadic Morality (TDM) thereby rests on the \"dyadic\" causal relationship between harm and immorality.  It predicts that: 1) perceived harm (and therefore perceived immorality) are on a continuum of severity, instead of being \"all or nothing\"; and 2) harm and immorality form a self-reinforcing spiral, so that a perception of immorality lead to a perception of harm, leading to a higher perception of immorality, leading to a higher perception of harm, etc., etc.\n\nThis mutual reinforcement may be related to the \"Smoke Detector Principle\" (Nesse, 2004).  This states that we pay much more attention to potential threats than to potential opportunities, for good evolutionary reasons: it is better to give a false alarm than to be dead or injured.  Potential harm is a threat.\n\nOver the course of human history, there has been a general trend towards greater general compassion and social justice (Pinker, 2011).  Human morality seems to be \"self-correcting\", in a sense, like science.  TDM seeks to explain this, at least partially, through the mechanism of harm being seen as more immoral which is seen as more harmful and therefore more immoral (to some potential maximum level).\n\nAn alternative, complementary explanation for this phenomenon is increased sympathy for suffering victims because of the removal of restrictive norms.  If someone breaks a moral norm, we tend to disapprove of them, and disapproving of someone leads us to have less sympathy for their pain (Decety, 2011).  We literally feel someone's pain less, if we disapprove of them or their actions.  Over time, sexual norms have become relaxed, leaving norms of compassion and justice intact, and if no norm has been broken, no disapproval is warranted, and we may then have emotional resonance with the pain of previously persecuted groups such as gay people.\n\nDill and Darwall (2014:22) describe a number of times throughout history when public social disapproval of unethical behaviour made it more expedient to behave ethically rather than unethically.\n\nThis historical drift towards greater compassion and social justice is consistent with the self-maximising nature of well-being, which itself is consistent with maximising \"win-win\".  There is a biological pressure on every organism to do the things that will allow it to thrive, survive, and reproduce.  For example, the Smoke Detector Principle is consistent with this pressure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The case for moral dumbfounding**\n\nTDM appears to be an excellent and realistic theory of moral psychology.  The one place it falls down in my opinion is its treatment of moral dumbfounding, and this gap is a result of the theory of moral psychology not having an adequate theory of morality to respond to.\n\nMoral dumbfounding is where you ask someone why they think something is immoral, and they cannot tell you.  Famously, Immanuel Kant said that he knew that masturbation was wrong, but he didn't know why.  Jonathan Haidt (2013) and other researchers have presented subjects with a number of \"harmless\" wrongs and asked them to say what was wrong about them: such as consensual incest between adult siblings; having sex with a roast chicken and then eating it; or smearing faeces on a Bible.  Typically, people were unable to say exactly what was wrong with these things.  TDM maintains that this was because they were \"not allowed\" to say they were harmful.  In contrast, experiments by Schein and Gray (2017) have shown that people define the immorality of these things in terms of harm.\n\nHowever, the explanations in terms of harm are unconvincing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>For example, Anita Bryant believed that the \u201cpurity\u201d violation of gay rights would convince kids to be gay, which would not only destroy their vulnerable immortal souls but also undermine procreation and hence the American family, which would bankrupt the nation and eventually lead to anarchy (Bryant, 1977).  \n>  \n>*Anita Bryant (1977) - The Anita Bryant story: The survival of our nation\u2019s families and the threat of militant homosexuality. through Schein and Gray, (2017)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnita Bryant is a Christian, and religious people are well known for their opposition to homosexuality in itself, never mind for other reasons.  Religious people disapprove of gayness full stop.  But if you ask them why, they are not able to come up with convincing reasons.  Ultimately they are likely to point to the male-female pair-bond as being \"God's way\".  But why this should be God's way - is unknown to them.\n\nChapais (2008) hypothesises that the human family tree went from multi-male, multi-female mating as in our closest relatives, the chimpanzees and bonobos, to polygynous pair-bonding in the australopithicines (see Roberts, 2011), to the largely monogamous pair-bonding of the modern human race.  Monogamous pair-bonding is egalitarian for both sexes and therefore was the case for most of the past 2 million years (see Perry, 2021:110).  Pair-bonding, whether polygynous or monogamous, is the evolved way for humans to reproduce.\n\nOrganised religion has a society-building function (Norenzayen, 2013) and as such, we hypothesise that it sacralised reproduction and pair-bonding (polygynous or monogamous) so that no other type of sexual activity is permissible.  In addition, religion is patriarchal as it is a power structure that males can take advantage of to be patriarchal (controlling and coercing women as a way for men to acquire and retain mates) (Smuts, 1995).  Patriarchy despises women and by extension, men who act like women by having sex with other men, especially in the passive role.\n\nHence, the religious prejudice against homosexuality may be a combination of sacralising the male-female pair-bond, and patriarchy.  Religious people are not moral philosophers or scientists, and therefore cannot be expected to know this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Realistic model of evolved morality**\n\nThe MAC\/GM model is summarised in a table, here:\n\n[https:\/\/orangebud.co.uk\/morality\\_as\\_cooperation.html#summary](https:\/\/orangebud.co.uk\/morality_as_cooperation.html#summary)\n\nThe MAC\/GM (morality-as-cooperation \/ goals-methods) model of morality specifies five evolved moral domains, each with its own goal and method of achieving that goal.  Benefit and harm, or compassion, belong in the cooperative domain, as its goal is win-win mutualism, and helping non-kin is believed to have evolved within the context of close interdepence: what is good for you is good for me, because I depend on you to survive.\n\nWe may observe that the morality of groups\/teams\/partnerships is parallel to the morality of families.  The goal of each is the inclusive fitness of individuals, and altruism is in proportion to the value the recipient can bring to the donor (whether utility value, or genetic value).  In a group, the Stakeholder Principle dictates that \"I will help you when the benefit I gain from your well being is greater than the cost I incur in helping you.\"  In a family, Hamilton's Rule states that \"I will help you to the extent that we share genes\" (Perry, 2021:48).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Harmless harms**\n\nSo, in some cases of immorality, what is being harmed is sacred values.  If a value is either something we value in itself (i.e., a goal), or a policy for achieving a goal, then it is possible to damage it through the \"wrong\" behaviour.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**References**\n\nChapais, Bernard \u2013 \u201cPrimeval Kinship \u2013 how pair-bonding gave birth to human society\u201d; Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts 2008\n\nDecety, Jean \u2013 \u201cThe Neuroevolution of Empathy\u201d: Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 1231, 2011\n\nDill, Brendan; and Stephen Darwall - \"Moral Psychology as Accountability\"; \\[In Justin D\u2019Arms & Daniel Jacobson (eds.), Moral Psychology and Human Agency: Philosophical Essays on the Science of Ethics (pp. 40-83).

First of all, it seems to want to redefine faith, or define some new conception of it. Though calling it faith isn't really correct since the video is attempting to demonstrate a new concept. Faith already has at least two definitions which are both problematic and for good reason. Even the modern definition: \"complete trust or confidence in someone or something.\" Which is problematic since it doesn't differentiate between reasonable and unreasonable aspects of partial knowledge. Having complete trust in anything is unreasonable since all knowledge is contextual to begin with.\n\nThe video doesn't consider the implications of reasonable and unreasonable partial knowledge. Also, this redefinition of faith ignores the history of faith and its prior definitions. Its true that people redefine words all the time, however, when developing a new concept I find it to be a bit dishonest when these facts aren't talked about and especially when the new definition is a softer form of the previous conception. Because this new definition being presented essentially requires 'reasonableness' which the video doesn't even conceptualize or consider.\n\nBased on the objections I have, I can't take the conclusions seriously.","upvotes":21,"created_utc":1677511222.0},{"author":"Skarr87","text":"The problem is most definitions of faith define it as a belief held regardless of evidence or reason.  If you have good reason to believe something is true it\u2019s no longer faith.  In addition faith often requires belief in the presence of evidence that contradicts the belief.  \n\nI also think that in general trying to relegate faith to a reasonable belief makes it lose its value because by the definition in the video if a belief is unreasonable then you shouldn\u2019t have faith it.  So if say you have a terminal disease that no one has ever survived then it would be unreasonable to have faith that you would survive it.  If faith does not require reason then belief that you will survive it, even though you won\u2019t\/don\u2019t, can give the value of alleviating the existential dread of impending death.\n\nIn epistemology (the theory of knowledge) all knowledge is a belief claim that is split into two categories.  You have justified belief vs unjustified belief.  Typically faith falls into the category of unjustified belief and if it is justified the it is no longer faith.  For example I don\u2019t have faith the sun will rise every morning because it has risen every day I have been alive.  So me \u201cknowing\u201d the sun will rise is a justified belief because it always has risen.","upvotes":11,"created_utc":1677512482.0},{"author":"Rogue100","text":"Seems to want to use a definition of faith that is new and\/or quite different from the common understanding.","upvotes":4,"created_utc":1677538405.0},{"author":"LilyWhitesN17","text":"Have no need for it...doing just fine as is, therefore...NOT necessary.","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1677522599.0},{"author":"whentheworldquiets","text":"**Thoughts as I was listening, first:**\n\n1. No, we don't all understand that faith is something that drives our beliefs similar to reason. See below.\n2. The way you dismiss the possibility of faith being opposed to reason is fallacious. While it is logically correct that two statements cannot be simultaneously both true *and* mutually exclusive, there is nothing at all preventing someone from *believing* something that either isn't true or which is against all reason.\n3. The ensuing Venn diagram logic is built upon this fallacious foundation and thus has no  merit.\n4. The conflation of facts and beliefs continues into the 'radio button' segment. Beliefs are not subject to logical constraints. People are perfectly capable of maintaining mutually incompatible beliefs, either because they don't realise they are incompatible, or because they actively avoid the cognitive dissonance of considering them together.\n5. Moving on from beliefs to behaviour... I'm sorry, but this is just getting silly. If someone is agnostic to a proposition, then their behaviour **does not factor in the truth of the proposition**. The famous example of Sherlock Holmes neither knowing nor caring which of the Sun and Earth orbited the other - it had no bearing on his actions. Hell, I defy anyone to point me to a religious believer who *always* acts as though God exists, or an atheist who *always* acts as though one does not. This part is absolute nonsense.\n6. Around 6:22, we stride confidently into 'no true Scotsman' territory by declaring faith that goes against reason 'irrational'. So what? Making this distinction does not automatically shift all extant faith-based beliefs to the 'right side' of the line we just drew. They could *all* be irrational, and thus not qualify as 'true' faith.\n7. At 7:14, the video demonstrates the fallacy of its own earlier logic. It shows 'faith' yielding a certainty greater than that which can be justified by reason alone. If I roll two dice, reason tells me it probably won't come up snake-eyes. I'm somewhere between ignorant and certain. How, exactly, would true faith making me certain that it won't come up snake-eyes be an improvement? Clearly, faith **as defined in the video** exceeds the bounds of what could reasonably be believed.\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\nAs I said at the start, I don't agree that faith is something 'like reason' that drives beliefs. Faith cannot lead you to a belief, or temper it, as reason can.\n\nOne thing the video does get right are the arrows leading away from reason and showing where faith can take you. That's bang on. Whether it is believing as a certainty something that is doubtful, or refusing to believe that for which there is good evidence, faith is the fuel. Where the video goes astray is in attempting to draw false distinctions between arrows that augment reasonable belief and those that mute or contradict it. Even were we to accept that distinction as meaningful, it would leave the entire panoply of extant beliefs in limbo, yet to be judged 'irrational' or 'true' faith.\n\nStill, if what the video shows is accurate, and faith is a measure of willingness to deviate from reason, the principle of natural selection would suggest faith would be found in greatest abundance where the stakes are lowest: where the proximate consequences of belief vs non-belief are negligible or unknowable, or where the social benefits of displaying belief outweigh all else. And this is of course what we find.","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1677537698.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1677506300.0},{"author":"Rowan-Trees","text":"Atheist here, and for all intents and purposes, religion can go fuck itself.

Because of this, faith is a function of  reason, not it\u2019s opposite. This is essentially Wittgenstein. For instance, Since I don't have Isaac Newton in the flesh to defer to\u2014only texts\u2014I am forced to put reasonable faith in how said texts have framed him and his arguments. In order to accept scientific studies, I have to first have reasonable faith that the scientific model can draw meaningful conclusions about the world.\n\n  \nReason tells us what to put our faith in, while demolishing faith in irrational things. At the opposite end, you could consider conspiracy theorists (an example straight from Wittgenstein). Conspiracy theories are when reason is thoroughly divorced from faith.

My impression is that human\/animal cognition (which is granted to be conscious) is being compared to an understanding of artificial cognition as an increasingly complex series of if\/then logic gates that can eventually become difficult to distinguish from animal cognition, but will (rightly) always be considered a synthetic imitation. This is not the case, and with a more accurate understanding of modern AI, a very different set of questions needs to be raised.\n\nFor example, a key section argues that animal consciousness has a history of memories upon which it will base its decision. It is our history that makes us conscious, our ability to perceive and learn that elevates us. This is, as I understand, exactly how neural networks used by AI's work: a 'history' is created for the AI with each decision it makes storing (**remembering**) the consequence of that decision and assigning a value of how effective this was (**how it made it feel**) and this is used to learn both specific tasks and, increasingly, generalised understanding of topics.\n\nTo give an example of how NN AI models animal consciousness far more closely than the article seems to suggest, I'll break down the first steps of a real NN AI built to play Mario. The AI moves forward in the game, which moves it closer to its goal. **Going forward is good**. Soon enough, it hits a goomba and dies. **Going forward into goombas is drastically not good. It outweighs the value of going forward**. Next time, it will go forward until it perceives a goomba. It may try to go backwards, stop, duck, all of which halt or reverse progress (bad), until it tries to jump. It passes the goomba and continues to go forward. **Jumping over goombas is good**.\nThe developers of Mario spent literal months obsessing over the first moments of their game to be a perfect way to train a child mind, without language, as to the rules of its game. Within seconds they ensured you encountered certain death until you learn to jump over goombas, and placed the 'power mushroom' in such a way that you are likely to accidentally trigger it when evading the goomba. That way, if a child did not have the curiosity to touch the mystery box, they would likely do so by accident. They then placed that first green pipe (I know you can see it!) so it would block the power up's movement and bounce it into the player, so even if a child mistook it as something to avoid they would likely hit it and see that it was good, remembering a positive association between both mystery boxes and power up mushrooms for next time.\n\nIt is no coincidence that these design techniques, built for children, work completely naturally with a well built neural network AI. You do not need to add special programming to the game to translate what is happening into something a 'computer' can understand: you set up a neural network, give it the controls of the game, set up a positive association with 'forwards' and negative associations with 'backwards' and 'death', and enable it to remember the entities of the game world. It will learn to complete mario by building memories of every action and how the action made it feel.\n\nWe can all agree that this mario playing AI is not conscious. Perhaps the reason, given the title, is that this AI lacks _significant enough_ memories: we don't like it when mario dies because he makes a sad face, he falls off screen, a defeated tune plays. It reminds us of injury, death, failure, things that our organic machinery is wired to dislike, and upon which we have years of experience that colour our understanding of what is happening and what we want. Well, if any of that was helpful, perhaps we build a mario playing AI that at first knows nothing but innate drives towards sustaining itself. Over years, we could teach an AI the importance of people by having the AI be nurtured and cared for, give the AI a sense of 'hunger' or 'discomfort' which people alleviate for it. Read it stories and show it cartoons that give it positive and negative associations with this or that, play it 'happy music' and 'sad music' , show it 'happy faces' and 'sad faces', and then finally after years, sit it down to play mario, and have it naturally record its first contact with a goomba and subsequent death as, by this point, 'intrinsically' bad. The only reason we didn't do this is because it's a really ineffective way of building an AI that can complete mario.\n\nMaybe the argument is that _actual_  neurons are required for consciousness. That we have to _feel_ those electrical signals, not just _record_ them. Well, it's a long time since I checked on the progress of this line of study, but years ago they had mapped the neural structure of a particularly simple kind of worm exactly, and replicated it digitally. They then gave this worm (and again, this is an exact replica of an organic creature) a mechanical body, with impact, heat and light sensors. The mechanical worm began to move around the room, reacting away from sources of light, turning when impacting with walls, seeking nutrition it had no way of finding or consuming. If I remember correctly, the worm's first body was built from Lego.\n\nIs that combination enough to grant consciousness? If we have an AI that learns in the way that a human child does, and we built an _actual_ neural network that physically exists and mirrors _exaxtly_ the electrical signals that flow through an animal, sending them to _exaxtly_ the parts of a precisely replicated brain, is it granted consciousness? What bits do we have to strip away from that until it loses it's right to consciousness? What if the exact physical replication of an animal brain is digitised, stored on an SSD? What if the network of neurons is emulated too?\n\nAgain, I'm no expert in the topic, only an enthusiastic follower that has grown up wondering what the difference between myself and the artificial intelligence I grew up around truly was. That in mind, it seems clear to me that the gap between today's artificial intelligence and consciousness is wide, but it need not be bridged by 'cheating' and copying exactly the 3d structure of the brain. We don't know how electrical signals are processed there to create consciousness, but we needn't demand that mystery of digital intelligence. Us being able to log and report exactly the reason why a digital intelligence reaches a decision doesn't make it artificial, and if tomorrow we understood exactly how incoming electrical signals to the brain would be processed in relation to the data stored there, we wouldn't stop being real. The difference between us lies somewhere else: and until we can map that gulf exactly, we should probably continue to heed the unsettling concern that we might blindly cross it one day without realising.","upvotes":13,"created_utc":1677486206.0},{"author":"Wolkrast","text":">The reason why AI can\u2019t love anything or yearn to be free is because it has no body. It has no source of feeling states or emotions, and these somatic feelings are essential for animal consciousness, decision-making, understanding, and creativity. Without feelings of pleasure and pain via the body, we don\u2019t have any preferences.\n\nThe article makes a number of very strong claims here. At the very least we know that AI is capable of decision-making, in fact that is the only thing it is designed to do.  \n\n\nThe heart of the argument seems to be less about a body - after all a robot with onboard AI would fulfill that definition, which is clearly not what the author is talking about - but about the difference between decisions motivated by logic versus decisions motivated by feelings. This begs the question how for example pain avoidance is different to optimizing a value function to avoid things that deduct from it's score. From outside, there is no way to observe that difference, because all we can observe is the behavior, not the decision making process.  \n\n\nWe should remember that until as recent as 1977, animals were generally considered as mere stimulus reaction machines.

As far as I know, we still don't know, where consciousness or feeling starts, but it does have a lot to do with the algorithmic behaviour of nerve cells, right?

By this I mean, can any particular theory be used to create a human adult level conscious machine. My bet is on the late Gerald Edelman's Extended Theory of Neuronal Group Selection. The lead group in robotics based on this theory is the Neurorobotics Lab at UC at Irvine.  Dr. Edelman distinguished between primary consciousness, which came first in evolution, and that humans share with other conscious animals, and higher order consciousness, which came to only humans with the acquisition of language.  A machine with primary consciousness will probably have to come first.\r  \n\r  \nWhat I find special about the TNGS is the Darwin series of automata created at the Neurosciences Institute by Dr. Edelman and his colleagues in the 1990's and 2000's.  These machines perform in the real world, not in a restricted simulated world, and display convincing physical behavior indicative of higher psychological functions necessary for consciousness, such as perceptual categorization, memory, and learning.  They are based on realistic models of the parts of the biological brain that the theory claims subserve these functions.  The extended TNGS allows for the emergence of consciousness based only on further evolutionary development of the brain areas responsible for these functions, in a parsimonious way.  No other research I've encountered is anywhere near as convincing.\r  \n\r  \n I post because on almost every video and article about the brain and consciousness that I encounter,  the attitude seems to be that we still know next to nothing about how the brain and consciousness work; that there's lots of data but no unifying theory.  I believe the extended TNGS  is that theory.  My motivation is to keep that theory in front of the public.  And obviously, I consider it the route to a truly conscious machine, primary and higher-order.\r  \n\r  \nMy advice to people who want to create a conscious machine is to seriously ground themselves in the extended TNGS and the Darwin automata first, and proceed from there, by applying to Jeff Krichmar's lab at UC Irvine, possibly.

In practice, our knowledge of the world is often based on a dynamic interaction between our perceptions and our concepts, rather than a strict separation between the two.\n\nSecond, exposure theory also implies that our knowledge of the world is entirely arbitrary and culturally constructed, which overlooks the possibility of objective knowledge. While our knowledge of the world is undoubtedly shaped by cultural and linguistic factors, it is also possible to arrive at shared truths about reality that are independent of these factors.\n\nFinally, exposure theory may lead to a kind of relativism that undermines the possibility of meaningful ethical or political action. If our knowledge of the world is entirely mediated by language and culture, then it may seem that any ethical or political claims we make are simply expressions of our own subjective perspectives. However, it is possible to argue that certain ethical and political claims are objectively valid, based on shared values or principles that are not simply relative to individual perspectives.\n\nIn sum, while exposure theory raises some important points about the limitations of our knowledge of the world, it also overlooks the possibility of objective knowledge and may lead to a kind of relativism that undermines meaningful action.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1677400937.0},{"author":"Far_Cartographer80","text":"The 0.35% of EM waves we see, the few longitudinal pressure waves we a couple limited chemical sensors and some nerves that report something about electron repulsion around our skin, and a brain that collates it into a meaningful usable hallucination, that maps to dangers, desires rewards in the outer reality (if and whatever that may mean).\n\nI cant see where ant closures can come from.

How? What logical train of thought would even lead someone to this conclusion? Unfortunately the author doesn't elaborate, they just threw this out there with 0 context or explanation.\n\nAlso when they describe the difference between the Emmet Till painting they criticize and their own exhibit for Tamir Rice I sensed a lot of Fundamental Attribution Error in effect. When Schultz does it it's insincere and for their cultural\/capitalistic profit. But when the author does it it's because they're genuine and sympathetic. Ok lol.\n\nAlso, I still don't quite understand what they even mean by \"trauma feeding.\" In their first given explanation they say that it is: \"a practice of making art about trauma that has the obvious effect of soliciting people\u2019s sympathy and, possibly, stirring up more trauma or trauma-related effects in spectators.\"\n\nBut then when discussing the Open Casket painting they criticize Dana for portraying a trauma that she had no connection to or participation in. So is trauma feeding when one makes art about trauma, or when one makes art about the trauma of another? There's a world of difference between those two things and I didn't find a more clear definition.\n\nWhich is my main complaint with a lot of writing in the same lane as this, which is the tremendous amount of context that is left out for one reason or another. The author makes claims about Dana Schultz that seem to be nothing more than wild speculation to someone like me who knows neither the author or Schultz. So either there was context about Schultz that the author for some reason decided not to include in their argument, or there was no context and the author's claims are literally just baseless speculation. I wish more authors would spend the time to elaborate on and defend their claims instead of just throwing them out there with no real basis. \n\nLastly, I just straight up disagree that art needs \"follow through.\" Social Justice is great, but it doesn't need to be a part of everything. If someone wants social justice that's great, if they want to make art with \"follow through\" and that aim in mind that's great, but to me it's still ok to make art that is just art. I don't see why that's not ok regardless of the content of the art. That doesn't make the Open Casket painting free from criticism, of course; it can be tasteless or tactless for any number of reasons. But I do find the criticism that the painting is immoral because it elicits empathy and has no social follow through to be pretty absurd.","upvotes":12,"created_utc":1677282886.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":10,"created_utc":1677253800.0},{"author":"fffyhhiurfgghh","text":"Art brings out emotion and sometimes the goal is to lead to action.

To me the phrase raises the question of what your will is free from. I can understand in a religious context, where it basically seems to mean God isn't manipulating people to act in a certain way, but without positing an entity that could control people, it's hard for me to pin down a definition.\n\nMy intuitive definition is that if you have free will, you could make different decisions than the ones you actually end up making, but that definition depends on what it means to say you \"could\" do something different. If we had access to multiple branching timelines, we could say it means there are branches whose only difference arises from someone making a different decision from exactly the same circumstances, but since we only have access to a single timeline, it seems that the idea that things could have been different is merely a feature of the human imagination that isn't reflected in reality.","upvotes":158,"created_utc":1677182498.0},{"author":"slickwombat","text":">The starting point of this argument is that free will is incompatible with determinism, a worldview that dominated science in the past and remains influential today.\n\nGiven that most philosophers deny this starting point, and further that compatibilism vs. incompatibilism seems to be pretty much the crux of the debate about free will, this is not a good place to start.\n\n>US philosopher Peter van Inwagen provides a vivid illustration of this argument, in his book An Essay on Free Will. If determinism is true, the laws of nature and the past together guarantee you will move your finger. It therefore follows that if you have the power not to move your finger, you would also have the power to change the laws or the past.\n\nDoes Van Inwagen actually say this, or is this the article writer's embellishment? The linked essay is paywalled, but IIRC Van Inwagen's general view on free will is that it requires the ability to do otherwise than we in fact do, and not in a merely counterfactual sense, and that in fact we can do so; he is a metaphysical libertarian, i.e., an incompatibilist who believes in free will. This \"power to change the laws or the past\" stuff sounds perilously close to Sam Harris' caricature of incompatibilist free will.\n\n>Quantum physics shows the occurrence of some events to be literally random.\n\nThe supposed randomness of events in quantum physics is not generally held to have any ramifications for free will.

These traits are determined by our genes and the environment we grew up in, and are not under our conscious control.\n\nAdditionally, many aspects of our bodies and minds, including chemical reactions and neural activity, are determined by factors beyond our control, such as genetics and environmental influences.

But in the quantum world, the fact that there is always a nonzero chance that the electron sailing toward a barrier will pop straight through without a second thought (as much thought as can be given by this anthropomorphic electron, anyway) is one of the most important non-obvious things which are required to happen to allow the device upon which you are currently reading this and which I am currently writing this to function.  We call this non-obvious nonzero chance quantum tunneling and it's, among other things, how RAM and flash memory work.\n\nJust because you might think it obvious does, in no way, make it so as the universe is under no obligation to make sense to anyone but itself.\n\n>>\"An initial reaction is that, while determinism was important historically, it now seems false.\"\n>>\n>>Quantum physics shows the occurrence of some events to be literally random.\"\n\nThe outcome of the events appear random but the actions that set those seemingly random events in motion are not.  And we aren't entirely sure if the events are truly random.  There is evidence that it's a false random wherein we just don't fully understand the mechanism which the events followed.  If you see a train go by your window but you didn't know of or see the tracks it doesn't mean the train was A. ever on the tracks and B. the tracks don't exist.  In fact, C. the train moved upon the tracks is probably the best answer.  In this example, though, we understand tracks exist and what they do, it could be that the 'tracks' of the path of the seemingly random event are unknown to us at this time.  The universe would thus be able to produce pseudo-random events.\n\n>>\"We are free to move our finger. That is neither determined nor random \u2014 it\u2019s a choice we can feel in our bones.\"\n\nWe know right now that if one was to wear the proper equipment on themselves and test for it, our brain activity would show the choice of 'to move the finger' to exist roughly 10 seconds prior to our conscious mind becoming aware of the fact that we have made the choice and there is, in some cases, times when the actions are already well underway before our conscious mind becomes aware that we made the decision (which we often term as 'acts of the moment' or ones 'of passion').\n\nThe actions of our bodies are merely, at their base level, the interaction of particles, atoms, and chemistry.  These things all hinge on the preceding state all the way back to before they existed in the form of your head.  This truth cannot be stripped away from them.  At what point does event z not rely on the ending state of event y all the way back to event a?  Where is that line drawn?  Anywhere it would be drawn requires that it be done so arbitrarily.  This fact doesn't allow for free will to exist.\n\nThe universe is deterministic.  The only thing that will happen is the only thing that can happen.  You are living in a movie the plot of which you only know as it happens to you.  Free will is illusionary.  Why do we perceive our choice to be a spare of the moment action?  Who knows but science tells us that it most certainly isn't.\n\nYou are only free to move your finger if the variables within the universe allow you to do so.  Under those circumstances, however, it becomes a case wherein you are not allowed to not move your finger.  The universe wills it so you will.  Without exception.\n\nNow some scientists have taken to reinterpreting Copenhagen with a barrier between the submicro and the macro world wherein free will magically becomes possible but there is no evidence supplied for it.\n\nOr they say that all outcomes happen and we only experience one version of the waveform collapse but within the bounds of the, frankly fairytale that is the many worlds, the wave collapse we actually experience is still deterministic.  If all possible outcomes happen then all possible outcomes had to be determined and the one we experience was the only one we could experience.\n\n\"No!  But you experience them all but this version of you simply isn't aware of the others!\" I once heard it argued.  Well, in that case, each version of me is still living a determined life!\n\nSo this article that is slightly redundant has the only argument of moving a finger but science dispels that notion well enough (seriously the \u224810 second gap between subconsciously making a decision and becoming consciously aware of the decision that was made is a LONG time).\n\nNow let's discuss the fact that, should one gain the ability to perceive the active state of all variables in the universe at this very second, they could mathematically run those variables back and know precisely and quite literally everything that happened in the past down to spread the first T-Rex fart and beyond to the very start of the big bang.\nThen!  Using that same information, they could extrapolate with 100% accuracy the events that will play out in the future until the heat death of the universe.  And any physicist worth his salt will know and be able to explain this fact to you.\n\nHow then, this being true, can anyone ever believe they have free will!?\n\nThe final argument against the idea of free will rests on the nonexistent shoulders of the humble photon: a particle for which time doesn't actually exist.  The photon is born and immediately dies (anthropomorphism added for effect alone) no matter how much time exists in the middle.  The first photons from \u224814 billion years ago that have slammed into the collector of the JWST did so in an instant only after about 14 billion years wait.  As far as the photon is concerned it was always ending up where the photocell collected it.  From the moment it started off, it's path in space and time was as set as its end.\n\nThe universe is deterministic.  We don't like the idea.  I get that.  But the idea of a deterministic universe has been widely known for a very long time.  After all, one of the earliest jewish teachings talk about the will of god: an inescapable, unchanging will that we cannot actively fight against.  Even some of the oldest writing in the world tell of their gods will.  Now, I doubt god exists but our tendency to name things we don't understand yet experience is found within the concept of god quite nicely.  After all: all lightening was once hurled from his throne upon mount Olympus by Zeus.  Same concept applied to a different action.\n\nNo matter what you call it, the universe has always been dependent upon the state it was in a moment ago and the only thing which might flow from that state is the next one.  It is determined by it by requirement; thus deterministic.\n\nI have yet to hear evidence against it unless one calls upon an idea that requires just as much faith as god and shows just as much evidence.  Or, is just a bunch wishful thinking.  Or, in the case of Many Worlds: all three.\n\nTo that end, however, I am very much open to being wrong.  It might sting us all at times, but the ability to learn is never a bad thing so I welcome honest, open dialogue on this or any other topic.\n\nEDIT: And yes, I'm just as much fun as parties as you might expect.

Reading the book, it quickly becomes clear that the title refers to being anti-Christian rather than being anti-Jesus, because Nietzsche speaks in terms of admiration for Jesus. \n\n  \nHe blames the early Christians (the Apostles, and Paul specifically) of distorting Christ's message for their own political and social gain, introducing elements of ressentiment and will to power that were simply absent from Jesus's life and teachings.\n\n  \nThis video looks at a passage in the Antichrist in which Nietzsche claims that Jesus was not a hero nor a genius. It's a reaction to Ernest Renan, a historian of religion who played a central role in what theologians now call the \"quest for the historical Jesus.\" A period in history during which scholars looked at the Gospels through the historical, not the theological, lens. It was a movement that sought to demystify the Gospels and separate fact from legend. Studying the Gospels as you would any other historical text, by critically examining its sources and internal contradictions.\n\n  \nRenan, in his best-selling and hugely influential biography of Jesus, ascribed heroic qualities to Jesus (while also denying his divinity and ability to perform miracles.) \n\n  \nNietzsche accuses Renan of being a lackluster psychologist and furthermore that to call Jesus a hero is simply a mistake.   \n\n\n  \nHe then proceeds to give his own account of Jesus's psychological profile: claiming that the undistorted message of Jesus is one of asceticism, a new mode of being, free from resentment, a superabundance of love -- quite the opposite of what later Christians would make of his life when they sought to claim some sort of victory over their Roman oppressors and introduced ideas like Heaven or the claim that the Kingdom of God is some sort of other world which will come to pass in a future time in a spiritual place.","upvotes":275,"created_utc":1677092121.0},{"author":"newyne","text":"I'm kinda similar; I've come to a perspective of Jesus being against attempts to immortality through ego (e.g. through wealth, fame, power, etc.). These are ultimately self-defeating because they can only ever be postponements of fear of death. For me, the only way out of spiritual death was to make a *leap of faith* that my logical conclusions were sound, that I have reason to believe that death is nothing to fear. I think there's also something in there about ego-death through compassion for others who share our condition? In other words, *ego* is largely driven by anxiety, an impulse to self-preservation and advancement. On the other hand, ego-death is kind of a letting go of that whole struggle. Ironically, I place my *truest self* (or at least what feels like it to me) *at* the point of dissolution: I get *deeply* involved in shipping fictional characters, and I *inhabit* characters; *I* in the sense of *my* personality kinda disappears. Although... Of course those characters tend to become *like* me, and I like them, through the process of identification... But anyway, that emotional experience, that feeling of love and home, is what feels like *me.* Interestingly, I have heard many people who have had like mystic experience say that our essential nature is love; it took me a long time to put the two together, but like... Damn! I've done a lot of work trying to reconcile that with my more postmodern tendencies, and I think it makes sense if you understand things like struggle and resistance as part of life in the body... \n\nBut *anyway!* The point is that I think you don't necessarily have to have spiritual beliefs for this to work; the stuff about love can apply regardless. Do I think all of this was Jesus' \"real\" message? I dunno, I think it's *in there,* at least, since he *did* seem to have an anti-materialistic streak. To me, though, that's kind of irrelevant; I think Jesus' \"real\" message is impossible for *anyone* to know. But yeah, I have *long* interpreted his words on finding salvation as being about *living* like him, not *worshipping* him.\n\nFunny, innit, how Nietzsche ended up being misinterpreted and used to hurt people, too. I do think there are Nietzsche worshippers who think he had *the* right answers that will work for everyone, and if they don't they're just not trying hard enough. I've definitely run into that.","upvotes":98,"created_utc":1677101551.0},{"author":"Paroxysm111","text":"Frankly it's pretty clear when you compare what Jesus said vs what was going on politically at the time. Jesus was all about changing people's ideas of right and wrong and emphasizing love and consideration of others. He helped everyone.

I'm pretty sure this hagiographic editing happened to the New Testament and Old Testament both countless times over the years as various books were included and edited and added later.\n\nWhat was really pretty interesting was the claim the apostles were in disagreement over to whether to include the Old Testament in the bible at all, and whether the whole \"kingdom of God\" was really about establishing a theocracy as a result of dissatisifcation from the rule of the romans, and how that \"Holy Land\" was only for followers\/believers as a result.  It basically leads me to the conclusion we can conclude almost nothing about what the \"original content\" of any street preaching actually was.\n\nThe whole realization that the \"Kingdom of God\" thing was possibly massively misinterpreted by modern Christians was a bit scary though.\n\nWhile the Gnostic stuff is pretty far out there, and they went a long way to defend the details of the New Testament, I found the conclusion that earth was so bad that the \"God\" of the Old Testament couldn't have been the real perfect God (also, because he's so wrathful about weird things) to be amusing.","upvotes":30,"created_utc":1677097567.0},{"author":"VersaceEauFraiche","text":"Nietzsche be like \"Will to power!\" but then get all upsetti spaghetti when early Christians will to power over the Roman Empire.","upvotes":23,"created_utc":1677096406.0},{"author":"Martholomeow","text":"I\u2019ve always thought Jesus (if he really existed) was a philosopher whose message was muddled by time. \n\nHis ideas of loving your enemy, and treating everyone as a child of god were revolutionary philosophy for the time.

The Pauline Epistles are the earliest references to Jesus and were written by Paul roughly 70yrs after the time Jesus is said to have lived. Many people are confused about this because Paul claims to have met Jesus. That isn't accurate though. Paul claims to have met the ghost\/spirit of Jesus. That Jesus appeared to him in the body of a stranger while Paul was traveling..\n\nThere isn't any contemporary evidence that Jesus existed. Josephus is often cited as a non-bibical source. However Josephus doesn't claim to have known or seen Jesus. Josephus references James and says that James was said to be the Brother of Jesus. Josephus wasn't even contemporary to James. So it was Josephus writing about a guy  90yrs after the fact who had claimed to know Jesus. \n\nTacitus is the other non-bibical source. Tacitus works came more than a hundred years after Jesus was said to have lived (115AD. Tacitus referenced Nero blaming a fire on Christians. People extrapolate that to be a reference to Jesus but it isn't. Rather the reference is to the followers of Jesus. Tacitus is not a contemporary witness to Jesus. Tacitus merely confirms the existence of Christianity during the time of Nero (37AD - 68AD). Tacitus was contemporary to Nero either. \n\nJesus may or may not have ever been a real person. In the tradition of Moses and slaves of Egyptian or Noah's global flood we know that history doesn't need to be rooted in literal events to be believed thoroughly. To the extent that anyone knows Jesus and his work it's just an idea. An idea we get from early Christian work. There is no separating Jesus from Christianity. Nietzsche attempted to remove a fictional character from the take it exists in and weigh its merit independently.

Jot down enough of the idea to remind yourself later so you can get back to your life. Reflect on your notes before bed.\n\nDeep Writing\/Thinking Journal: keep a journal\/note for deep work (Cal Newport style), including deep thinking and deep writing. Write down your arguments, critique yourself, scratch out bad arguments, do the hard work of philosophy. \n\nPhilosophical Notes Notebook: take notes on philosophy lectures, even if you're not enrolled in philosophy at the moment, you can keep a notebook of notes from YouTube philosophy lectures and podcasts. Reflect on your lecture notes before deep work.\n\nProverbs Journal: force yourself to come up with pithy proverbs, gnomic statements, wise words. Resist the urge to analyze and qualify. Create a book of proverbs to pass down to your children. Think Pascal's Pens\u00e9es, Marcus Aurelius's Meditations, the Book of Proverbs, etc.\n\nPhilosophy Papers Journal: write your philosophy essays and outlines in a dedicated journal, including quotes. I've found that writing them by hand helps me remember much more of my papers. If you're not in academia, consider starting a wordpress or substack and publishing pieces there. \n\nSoliloquies Journal: a journal where you talk with yourself with the aim of knowing yourself and examining your life. Perhaps this is more psychological? But psychology used to be under the auspices of philosophy so let's take this back at least. \n\nPhilosophical Poems Journal: be a philosophical sage, write some philosophical poetry. Wise words about deep concepts, in pleasing ways. \n\nOffice Hours Notebook: keep a journal of notes from times you sit down to discuss with your professors, your favorite abstract thinkers, or just from you philosophical conversations. \n\nWatch the video for further explanation.","upvotes":24,"created_utc":1677114386.0},{"author":"TheUnforgivenII","text":"I\u2019ll stick to the notes app on my phone full of random thoughts and unorganized  phrases.

The historical demography of most American cities follow this same pattern. \"Non-Hispanic Whites made up 59% of the residents of Chicago in 1970, falling to just 31.7% in 2010\". In Atlanta, Whites made up 48.4% of the population in 1970, 31% in 1990, and has risen to only to 38.4% in 2010. A few examples among many. \n\nThe author stating that Gentrification started in 1960 leads the reader to believe that there was massive influx of rich White people moving into these historically non-white urban centers but the exact opposite happened in the 1960s and 70s. Of course, as we all know this as White Flight. The author would be correct in stating that \"Since the 1960s, gentrification has become ubiquitous\" if they were to include non-Whites moving into White areas, but it is quite obvious that they would not assert such a thing. That is not how we colloquially used the word Gentrification. But this means the original assertion is factually incorrect. So why would they say such a thing? \n\nIt is done so to make the history of these events appear to cohere seamlessly with ideological priors, to make it easier to digest, to imbue passion within the reader to call for change. But history is a messy, fractal thing. By limiting ourselves to only a portion of history as to cohere seamlessly with our ideological priors we limit our understanding of such things. We must expand our understanding of such things as to craft better policy. This is philosophy subreddit after all, we have a love of wisdom. \n\nIn particular situations, such as the expansion of the tech sector in San Francisco, you have settled communities experienced a sort of widescale economic eviction. A rising tide is supposed to lift all boats but these peoples find themselves drowning under the waters of high rent. But it would be dishonest and unhelpful to place the blame solely on \"rich White people\" - the tech industry is very diverse and full of different nationalities. These are the people who are moving into these communities. The same kind of historical argument used on White people in these regards to gentrification doesn't work against Indian or East Asian software developers. This is a point to ponder, that needs to be addressed.\n\nOne could advocate for the continued expansion of public housing, demanding cheaper rent, asking for more funding for better public transportation all on their own virtues without having to consult with \"History\".

The housing stock may have declined a bit but it was still considered a good neighborhood.  Beginning in 2000, white and Asian families began buying houses and moving in.  This usually involved Black landlords evicting Black tenants who were generally unable to find rental housing they could afford in that neighborhood and had to move to less desirable neighborhoods.  The white and Asians moving in were hardly rich.  They were generally politically liberal and saw the diversity in the neighborhood as desirable.  They were the marginal middle class who were buying in the only neighborhood they could afford.  There is still a significant Black presence but they tend to be the more affluent homeowners.

Once one team scored, the losing team would trade places with those who\u2019d been on the sidelines. Sooner or later, everyone got a chance to play.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo we have some scarce resource and we need a way to allocate it amongst consumers.      Not everybody can use it at once, its limited in scope, and people will want to make sure its use is maximized during peak times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nImagine a *simple* player model:\n\nYou have some time budget on how long you can just be out there, T, some time on the field K, and a likelihood that you'll be picked to play, S.  And utility gained from playing U(K\/T).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo your condition is ensuring that U(K\/T) = S(K\/T), that the benefit to you from playing always at least has to be equal to the likelihood and time of you actually playing the game.    If U(K\/T) < S(K\/T), then you'll leave and do something else.   If U(K\/T) >S(K\/T), then you'll wait till its your turn.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe problem with this is if demand for the field increases, there are more people on the sidelines, so the likelihood of getting picked falls, and the time spent on the sideline rises.   S shrinks, T grows.      So you'd have to somehow magically get way more utility from playing a smaller amount.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat isn't sustainable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA permit simplifies things.   Imagine permit costs C, you have some friends F to split the cost with, and so your spending, P, is P = C\/F.     Since its just you and your friends, there is no waiting on the sidelines, S is 100%, and you spend all the time on the field, so K= T, so now we have\n\nU(K) = C\/F.      As long as the utility gained from playing soccer at least equals the individual share of the permit costs, you'll get the permit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe author is heading in the wrong direction.   It was never really a \"public\" good, it functioned as a private good where its both excludable and rivalrous --, and its allocation was fragile, dependent on some really circumstantial rules that people tacitly agreed to because demand for the field was relatively low, and the cost of abiding by the time was also low.     But as demand grows, these rules would break down and we would need a different way to allocate it to people -- a way that is more visible and clear to all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>then it seems that what the protestors were fundamentally objecting to was the practice of treating housing as just a commodity. For when housing is treated as just a commodity, residential landlords have a right to exclude tenants from their homes whenever they can no longer afford whatever rent the landlord demands. Writ large, this right of exclusion produces displacement and housing insecurity\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe rest of the article is basically not-answering the basic question:\n\n*How* do landlords retain price setting power?    Do all landlords have this power?     Does a landlord in no-where Wisconsin have the same market power as a landlord in The Mission?   Why, why not?         If landlord surplus is rising, how come other landlords are entering to capture that excess profit?\n\nWhy don't the people who are renting buy a home to protect themselves from cost inflation?    Can they?  Why or why not?     Why did that lady rent for *years* after watching her rent rise?  etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou gotta answer those questions before trying to your hand a policy proposal.

So they are not experts in that regard. Expertise in terms of judgments is somewhat harder to assess. Philosophers appear to be susceptible to the same framing effects as are laypeople, so that would speak against philosophers as expert moral judges. At the same time, philosophers might give better reasons for their judgments. This leads to the third understanding of moral expertise.

The overarching issue is that when applied to scenarios that are impossible or extremely unlike ones we are familiar with, our moral intuitions are untrustworthy. Wollen (the author of the linked article) is pulling a bait and switch here: he gives us the organ harvesting case, but then modifies it in the last 2 sentences to assert that it's somehow actually equivalent to the standard trolly problem. He cannot have it both ways.\n\nWollen's example.\n\n***Organ Harvesting: Five people are dying. Each needs a new organ, but none are available. The only way for the surgeon to avert their deaths is to kidnap an unwilling stranger, kill him, harvest his organs, and give them to the ailing five. Assume that this would have no bad consequences beyond the death of the stranger. (He won\u2019t be missed, and no-one will find out.)***\n\nThe experiment asks us to imagine an impossible situation, that is nothing like a scenario that a human could ever be in, and then foolishly asks us what our moral intuitions would be in that scenario. Wollen is either confused or disingenuous on this. His reasoning is: \n\n\"Absent some strong reason to doubt our intuition against killing in this particular case, we shouldn\u2019t doubt it just because, as a society, we have a strong aversion to killing generally.\"\n\nHe's failing to see just how crazy this hypothetical is:\n\n* The doctor can know 100% that \n   * He will get away with kidnapping and no one will find out\n   * He will get away with killing and no one will find out\n   * He can harvest the organs successfully\n   * The organs can be implanted successfully\n   * He can (assuming the hospital doesn't accept random organs with no paper work) falsify documents and get away with it\n   * No one will miss the man after he is killed\n* That's not even the wort part\n   * We are asked to assume that \"...this would have no bad consequences beyond the death of the stranger\", including on society as a whole\n\nThis hypothetical is almost as bad as asking us to imagine a square circle and then intuitively judge if it would have 4 sides or not. This doctor would need to have super-human epistemic powers to be able to know these things. This is a huge problem because operating with flawed epistemic access to the existing state of affairs and the actual consequences of our actions is a fundamentally important factor in what we find to be morally intuitive. \n\nWorse, though, is that the experiment asks us to assume that this kidnapping, killing, and lying will have \"no bad consequences beyond the death of the stranger\". This is a huge problem, as a big part of why we think kidnapping, killing strangers, and lying about it is wrong is BECAUSE of the negative impacts it has in real life. And, it's completely outside the power of normal humans to do such things and ensure that there are no negative externalities.\n\nThese, I submit, give us incredibly \"...strong reason to doubt our intuition against killing in this particular case\".\n\nTo rephrase the thought experiment more neutrally, it would need to be something like: \n\n***An epistemically perfect being that can see exactly what the consequences of her action will be is given exactly one choice to make: strike a man dead or do not strike him dead. She knows 100% that striking him dead will save 5 people and lead to a net benefit for society.***\n\nThis is essentially the classic trolley problem, stated differently.","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1677099813.0},{"author":"Flyingbluehippo","text":"I mean I'm glad they said it but is this really that necessary of a claim to argue against?

These desires after all, were just products of past events and causal chains\n- Who we are has to be defined somewhere down the causal chain though, the alternative would mean that we would be free of all our desires and thus not really \"us\". Being free of all desires would mean that we are not really ourselves since our desires are important to our identity\n\nVery interesting read, I think he makes a pretty compelling argument that is a lot more well defined\/coherent than my take on free will up to now which kind of just boiled down to \"all of who I am up to now has kind of been predetermined but even if free will is an illusion it's better to believe, even if falsely, that I am free so that I can function in society\" Would love to hear other takes, especially if I interpreted some of this incorrectly.","upvotes":35,"created_utc":1676855506.0},{"author":"bortlip","text":"IDK, I think things become clearer when you break the definitions down some and address the nuances more and I think that's what Compatibilism does.\n\nI think it can help to word things without using the actual words we are discussing, thus removing issues around differing definitions.

No it is not a physics question and nothing follows. \n\nAs I think both Harris and Dennett point out, physics is irrelevant here. *Being a slave to the dice is no more free than being a slave to the clockwork.* Stochastic mechanics are no more free than any other - they must be exactly random. Random behavior is the opposite of willpower.\n\nBesides, a device that is random cannot compute.

Your brain thinks because your neurons are non-random. The brain is a huge macrostructure with many emergent layers between your thoughts and molecular randomness. \n\nQuantum mechanics isn\u2019t magic or supernatural.

When you input \"2+5=\" into your calculator and it displays \"7\", is it because 2+5=7, or because the buttons changed the pattern of electric current in the calculator's circuits and caused a chain reaction resulting in the digit appearing on the display? Both answers are true, but the former one operates on a higher level than the latter. The same works for the question of whether you do what you do due to your soul's desire or due to neurons firing - both are true, but work on different levels. (This line of thought is used in Hofstadter's *I Am A Strange Loop*)\n\nA different way to look at it - free will, in Berlinesque terms, is a form of negative freedom - an absence of constraints. Since the freedom worth talking about is the one that affects our lived experience, the only constraints that matter are those we actively feel, or know about. Free will can therefore be violated only when the levels cross, e.g. the Oracle of Delphi tells you your fate and you want to change it but unable to; a company targets you with effective subliminal advertising, and so on. As long as the level where determinism is located is untouched by the level where you live, your freedom is intact. This is why randomness, chaos and fuzzyness feel liberating.\n\nHere I should mention [the best Existential Comic in years](https:\/\/www.existentialcomics.com\/comic\/470) (almost on par with SMBC at its best), according to which an AGI would see randomness as more detrimental to freedom than determinism, because it hinders its ability to have control over its environment.","upvotes":16,"created_utc":1676854577.0},{"author":"cloake","text":"I still think compatibilism is redundant.

It then points out all the reasons why people apply motivated reasoning to escape this obvious fact, and how misguided they are. Its only real claim is that the commonsense version and experience of free will does not require the super free will philosophers and theologians are chasing. Anyone who is seeking the latter to justify the former is in error on multiple levels. It is not the compatibilists who are trying yo redefine things, the incompatibilists did it first intentionally to perform a bait-and-switch.\n\nApart from pointing these two things out, there isn\u2019t much else. What the commonsense free will is, how it emerges, and how we should think about it is murky. Is the divide between conscious and subconscious relevant?

I am not sure what philosophy is left to do. Perhaps, then people should use philosophical tool to create their own conceptual boundaries to track what they personally care for and analyze if such a thing is coherent and if there is good warrant for believing them. Philosophers, can then, simply \"list\" different conceptions that reflective people (philosophers) have considered and objectively discuss what we gain and lose from each, instead of forcing one as uniquely \"true\" or consistent with what people, in general, care of (that's psychology).

The way I describe 'level of consciousness' is as a resolution aspect of data transfer, which is the interaction between composite material at all scales. The interaction aspect is closer to an influence, however, this interaction creates meaning. By 'meaning' I should say, this is a process, its ongoing, a system that is evolving at all times. 'Meaning' is just the act of interaction within a specific context. Meaning is therefore a process of evolution. Meaning as a concept, could not exist without consciousness, at all levels of existence there is meaning. Meaning is a contextual structure, it has no bearings other than the interactions it goes along with.\n\nSo, that is why consciousness is also symbolic. We can consider all the different thoughts and experiences we have as having meaning within a specific context, which are essentially symbolic. A symbol is the building block of our conscious experience specifically as contextual understanding. Understanding and knowledge are the combination of these symbols that give rise to to truth. Truth is a contextual aspect of reality, it exists within all of us and we live it every day. Truth is self revealing and exists unto itself, even if it is contextual.\n\nAll this leads me to two aspects of consciousness I'd like people to consider. One aspect is the total or complete experience. We generally experience consciousness in a singular way even in cases we'd expect otherwise. The other aspect is energy transfer or data transfer and how it relates to our consciousness.\n\nTo me, the total or complete experience of consciousness is the highest resolution we have of it. Resolution is a shared process between simultaneously connected composite material. For example, neurons in the brain are a connected composite material and together they share a process which leads to a higher resolution of consciousness. The brain specifically decodes sensory data and generates three-dimensional maps of firing neurons which are the symbols that consciousness then assimilates as perceptual data within a specific resolution.\n\nLower resolutions of consciousness therefore also exist within the body as subconscious or unconscious thoughts. They reach consciousness when they are experienced by our 'greater awareness' or the highest possible resolution of our consciousness.\n\nThere's a lot more that can be said about this, but this is as far as I can go for now.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1676982337.0},{"author":"fishred","text":"I found this article really interesting, and it was just the sort of thing I was hoping to read and think about today. \r\n\nWhile I am totally on board for the idea of consciousness as a spectrum rather than an either\/or, I think there are some concepts that are potentially conflated in the essay, and for me they detract from the overall clarity of the point that I think you're trying to make. (It's quite possible that I'm reading it wrong, though, in which case you can correct me.) The main issue that I have is this: we can accept your definition of binary consciousness and non-binary consciousness, and we can (as you encourage us to) reject the notion of binary consciousness and accept (as you encourage us to) the notion of non-binary consciousness, and that would not necessarily require us to accept that all things have consciousness or that there is no such thing as \"not-conscious.\" If consciousness, per Hagelin, is a fundamental aspect of the universe then all things are subject to consciousness, but that does not mean that all things have subjective consciousness. \r\n\nYour essay glitches then, for me, when you use the example of the rock. Energy transfer (unlike sensory response--at least as far as our knowledge can currently demonstrate--and even more so unlike a subjective reaction to sensory response) follows discernible patterns. The rock, as you note, in being acted upon by a hammer, will \"crack and split.\" However, I'm not sure you've justified this mere energy transfer as something that falls under the category of consciousness. It is true, as you note, that the reality of the rock splitting is \"completely verifiable through simple mathematics and testing, its proven in the laws of motion and the basic understanding of the transfer of energy,\" but that just means that the laws of physics apply. It doesn't mean that what the rock offers is a conscious response. I would argue that we know only that the rock is acted upon, and that we have no evidence that the consciousness of the rock plays any part in how the laws of physics play out. \r\n\nTo use a different example of energy transfer: If and when one defenestrates one's enemies, said enemy will likely scream and panic, and these are clearly responses to the experience of being tossed out the window. They will also fall towards the ground at increasing speeds until they meet a hard object. But I wouldn't characterize the act of falling as a \"response\" to gravity. That's just gravity doing what gravity does. \r\n\nWhat we understand consciousness to be exists (on a spectrum) in response to the sensory awareness of gravity and\/or its effects. If instead of one's enemies, some monster were to toss a cat out the window, the cat would also feel fear, perhaps, but would respond by searching quickly for a landing spot and adjusting their body and balance to try to get to that landing spot. That strikes me as consciousness responding to sensory input. But the fact of falling seems quite different. It doesn't take consciousness to obey the laws of gravity. Gravity doesn't care about your consciousness. (Rather, the consciousness seems to be contained in any response other than simply succumbing to it.) \r\n\nIf you throw a living plant out the window, the plant's innate desire to find light may be activated, and though it moves too slowly to follow through on that desire against the force of gravity and wind and so on, it is quite possible that, even as it falls to its death or destruction (though not consciously so in the same way as the human and the cat, because consciousness is a spectrum) it has some yearning for light until the moment that all light (metaphorically speaking) is extinguished for it. It doesn't contemplate its existence in response to the suddenly inconvenient fact of gravity, the way a human might; nor does it instinctively evaluate alternatives as a cat might. It just years, in its simple plant way, for light. \r\n\nThe rock, on the other hand, just falls. I don't think the rock demonstrates anything we would characterize as a \"response\" to gravity. It's Just an example of gravity doing gravity-type things on whatever happens to fall into its field.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1677013137.0},{"author":"INFOborg","text":"Interesting treatment.

Du Bois described it as exhausting, which tends to cause me to think that it is an unnecessary doubling that we have created in our pseudoscientific understanding of what race is, and how our constructs begin as misnomers, and continue to fail us.\n\nIt would seem that having to have to continuously switch identities, instead of just fully being one's self and embodying one's consciousness wholly with each interaction, has the potential to keep us in a sort of fight-or-flight state of mind. That can't be good, as those States keep us at arm's length from homeostatic states that allow us to heal and be at peace.\n\nLikewise, the notion of a race being 'white' appears to be similarly destructive in that it i) implements an erasure of one's authentic European identity in favor of a reductive antebellum term (based on pseudoscientific treatises), and ii) invariably leads many to a consciousness of \"superiority\" over other human beings (which can then only be asserted via violence).\n\nDon't get me wrong, I like the idea of consciousness not being binary.

His primary philosophical foundation was Nihilism. However, he went on to create the philosophy of \"\u00dcbermech\" (also known as \"overman\" or \"superman\") which can be rougly defined as an idealized version of ones self.\n\u00dcbermech has an insatiable lust for power. Not in the normal way we see power presented through lust, but power in growth. Power in ones self. Power in your mind.\nTo achieve this power, Nietzsche came up with an endless system to reach it. Self dissatisfaction> self improvement> self rediscovery> self dissatisfaction> self improvement.. etc etc. This is the circle of self-overcoming. If we have our own \"why\" in life, we'll get along just fine. \nThe most significant of his teachings (which I will draw back to later) is his theory of suffering. Life is full of suffering, this is a lesson all of us learn. However, it's not a matter of \"if\", but \"for what\". In the words of Nietzsche, \"The meaningless of suffering, not suffering itself, was the curse that layover mankind so far.\" \nArguably, Nietzsche is one of the most significant philosophers history has gave us. Point being, his beliefs will never become quixotic. While humanity and science and economy and society and the minds evolve, I doubt there will be a time where we find ourselves without need for self improvement. To push that, I doubt there will be a time where we find ourselves without need for suffering. To suffer is to grow, and to grow is to suffer. \nPoint of foreshadowing and explanation of his teachings, it is important that we as people, especially in the state of our world right now, reflect on our own growth. Are we dissatisfied with ourselves? Are we improving? Are we rediscovering? One can't rely heavily on an outside source to give them a sense of fulfillment, because we can only receive what we give ourselves.\nThank you for your time.","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1677046765.0},{"author":"Birot_Conjard","text":"Kripke logic is mind fuck, I just wanna throw it at people who say philosophy is easy, Hegel's convoluteness isn't even comparable","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1677077049.0},{"author":"andreasdagen","text":"is the common consensus that logic requires emotion or a goal?","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1677317336.0},{"author":"BikeFree50","text":"Does anyone use sauna to better focus on philosophical values like reflection, introspection, intentional acts?

Many of the arguments against free will explain why you should not believe in it, ironically enough as if it\u2019s a choice. Perhaps this is just a remark on our language\u2019s limitations, but I think this contradiction connects to a deeper problem. I have yet to determine whether I logically should believe in free will, yet I feel an unbearable need to. Other than the crushing despair I feel upon finding a reasonable argument against free will, I find that I am incapable of living my life without believing it, and I wonder if others feel the same. Choice is a fundamental part of my experience and I believe that this is the reason:\n\nThe lack of free will necessitates meaninglessness\u2014our existence serves no purpose, our experience is worthless, our interpretations are figments of the universe\u2019s own imaginings.\n\nPlease note that I do not mean to discuss the validity of free will nor it\u2019s moral implications in this post\u2014in fact I think the exercise may be rife with fallacies and biases until we figure out how to fully comprehend or speak of a world without it, something I fearfully hope to move towards with this post. \n\nTo further elaborate with examples, my relationship with another person is not the result of our choices, but a result of the past. The future does not depend on whether I choose to keep my values, but on whether the laws of nature determine that I will. In fact, the future may already exist and my experience of my life\u2019s sequence of moments is an accidental and ultimately arbitrary result of matter interacting. In this sense, time lacks any meaning other than the current location of our consciousness\u2014according to the material universe, none of it is changeable, it has all already happened. Deterministic fate seems to offer no meaning, it\u2019s simply what is, was, and will be. Our experience is an accident and our interpretation of it has no consequence on it; in fact, our apparent \u201cinterpretation\u201d is just another accidental consequence of it, it doesn\u2019t even come from our experience. \n\nIn the \u201cpresent moment\u201d as I designate it, the post I am making doesn\u2019t mean what I think it does. Rather than starting a discussion or introducing others to my opinions and new information, I am simply experiencing something I was always going to do. Without my agency, this post effectively has the same meaning as something I\u2019ve already done. My experience of this writing won\u2019t affect what is being written\u2014even writing this I find it hard to remove myself from the picture completely. Surely feeling a need to write that last sentence was caused by my conscious experience of these feelings. Yet, then again, here I am describing a cause and effect relationship. My experience didn\u2019t actually have anything to do with writing, I was just experiencing the bit of cognitive dissonance my neurons went through when my body was writing.\n\nTo put it more clearly\/succinctly, nothing my consciousness \u201cdoes,\u201d in that it is something that experiences a sequence of feelings and thoughts, can ever affect itself or it\u2019s surroundings. I feel it necessary to note here that I have not (nor have I tried to) disprove either free will or nihilism. As far as I can tell upon rereading this, I don\u2019t see any contradictions or arguments against either side. I think this discussion may have rather lead to a nihilistic definition of identity: we are not the script writers, I neglect to say we are even the actors; rather, we are a captive audience without even hands to applaud or tears to cry. The audience does not have their own opinions, nor are the actors aware of their existence. The actors may believe in free will or not, but the audience simply just watches their reasonings unfold. Even Camus\u2019s Sisyphus is actually just an actor, with his audience just feeling it\u2019s predetermined scorn against fate. Perhaps \u201cmy\u201d actor just happened to look at its audience and was influenced to believe that it was one and the same with itself\u2026\nAs far as I can tell, this seems to be a perfectly valid view of the experiential self. \n\nPersonally, I much prefer the identity given by free will. Even a restrained free will, influenced by biology and the intricate web of causality, allows much more meaning than existence in a superdeterminate block universe. This utter lack of meaning is the reason that I am more willing to accept an illusion if that is the truth, even though such an act goes against nearly all of my values. Furthermore, I find myself simply incapable of separating my experience from the world\u2019s happenings even in the language I use, though I made an attempt through metaphor.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1677200623.0},{"author":"Exileri","text":"Is hunger a state of being, a possession or an emotion\/feeling?\n\n\u201cI feel hungry (emotion)\u201d\n\u201cI am hungry (state)\u201d\n\u201cI have hunger (possession)\u201d\n\nJust a thought - other languages may distinguish it differently (e.g. Spanish\u2019s \u201ctengo hambre\u201d (I have hunger)), technically English will express it in all those ways, but which is correct?","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1677219983.0},{"author":"Cold-Shine-4601","text":"Maupertius - Where exactly is his decision of the princip of least action, in french?","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1677275449.0},{"author":"Alexander556","text":"If we had a device which could **reliably** (and **painlessly**) read peoples minds, without their consent, and could be used to pull specific informations from some ones brain, should we restrict it's use\\*?   \nShould we use this device at all?\n\n\\-Would it be unethical to search the brain of a criminal to find information on a crime?  \n\\-Should such information be used in court, or would it be considered as having to witness against oneself?  \n\\-Would it be unethical to search the mind of a convicted murderer, to find the locations where s\/he hid some of the victims, to give the families closure?  \n\\-Would it be a war crime to extract vital knowledge from a POW?  \n\n\n\\*For example, only to be used by psychiatrists etc. to help consenting patients, research purposes etc.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1677284931.0},{"author":"CapIndividual8784","text":"I\u2019ve always thought if there was a machine that could make other people feel your pain.especially people that have not experienced it.

This greatly resembles stoic philosophy and the emphasis it places on what we control in life. We choose what hobbies to take up, what books to read, and who to be friends with. In contrast to this, events in life are often random and happen by chance, and being emotionally invested in this is like playing the slot machines with your feelings.\n     Furthermore, by taking more of an interest in your hobbies and activities, you take away time you would've been using to think about those random life events. Therefore by pursuing your interests further, you not only gain a larger control over your emotions but you also become less invested in accidental life events.\n     In my opinion, I believe Hume should've gone further by distinguishing between consumption and creation.

It is much more complex than that. Humans have many different values, often conflicting with each other, and each person weighs values and who the values apply to differently. \n\nSome people value security more than freedom, for instance. Should a government do more invasive searches under the threat of a terrorist attack? Either they do nothing and potentially allow a terrorist attack, or they act to stop it and violate citizen\u2019s freedoms in the process. This is a Trolley Problem. Your article suggests \"No answer would be justifiable to all involved parties since they would all have a reasonable claim to not being [killed\/invasively searched]\". Your Trolley Problem article also states, \"Like so many other life dilemmas, pure reason cannot provide a definite answer to the trolley problem. Only the free self can make a choice whenever there are sufficient reasons for either side of a decision.\" Basically, when we get to moral problems with any degree of complexity, your model of pure reason is insufficient.\n\nAdditionally, your reasoning is insufficient that \"valuing freedom necessarily implies valuing the freedom of others\". To show the gap in logic, let me present this statement in propositional logic:\n\nDefinitions: *Freedom(X,Y)* means that X values Y's freedom, *Free(X)* means that X is a free agent, and H is the set of humans. We can assume (\u2200X in H, Free(X)\\^Freedom(X,X)). \"\u2200\" means \"for all\"\n\nSo then your claim is that (\u2200X,Y in H, Freedom(X,X) \u21d2 Freedom(X,Y)). Your justification in the linked article is \"If others are regarded as having similar freedom to his own\u2014by having the capacity to freely make decisions, including the decision whether or not to be moral\u2014then he cannot deny the value of their own freedom\". Propositionally, this is (if \u2200X,Y in H, Free(X)\\^Free(Y)\\^Freedom(X,X) then Freedom(X,Y)). This does not follow.

The actual process of objectivity necessarily involves communal dialectics with people who disagree and challenge in order to weed out emotional processes. This takes time effort and discomfort.\n\nThe problem with these sorts of articles and how people interpret them is that they appear to be some sort of \u201cgotcha\u201d on the merits of objectivity when in reality they aren\u2019t saying anything new or unaccounted for in the spheres that actually orient themselves around objective pursuit. \n\nGuarding against this reality (of one individual or a monolithic group of people claiming to be objective) is the basis of science, peer review, American democracy via representation, and dialectical processes. It\u2019s an indictment on dictatorships or loss of free speech to challenge ideas, not an indictment against objectivity. It is a critique on single individuals or like minded grouped claiming to be purely rational and thus immune from the necessity to participate in dialectics.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say objectivity applies to everything: metaphysical values such as sacrificial compassion vs a survival of the fittest mentality are purely subjective. But we can still apply objective processes to them: ie we can tell if a person is holding and applying a stated value consistently or hypocritically; we can tell what the results of a value produce.\n\nScience also is aware that we can\u2019t know anything for sure which is why it relies on \u201cverisimilitude\u201d, that is, some things being more certain to be true than others, and notions of utilitarianism (ie what is our goal and will doing X produce this).\n\nIe a sole scientist is not able to be objective, but a group of 100 disagreeing scientists can work to hone in on and weed out subjective biases and cognitive errors in a collective effort to arrive at a 93% certainty that X is X, with a maximum certainty of perhaps 99%. Never 100%.\n\nDoctors are trained in this way too. It\u2019s why a good doctor won\u2019t ever tell you that you have a 100% chance of survival in a surgical procedure or medicine. The best one could say is \u201cthis procedure has a 99% observed success rate without any serious complications to resolve issue X and we believe the benefits outweigh the risks\u201d \n\nAnd that was arrived at through long term dialectical processes, whose methodology can be applied to a myriad of other issues in life. This is what objectivism means - it is not a solo effort, it is not a short term effort, and it is not a certainty. Rather it is working together as humans through dialectics using specific methods intended to weed out biases and emotions.\n\nIt\u2019s not perfect, it\u2019s not easy, it\u2019s not quick. But it does work towards a stated goal, ie, practically reducing suffering.\n\nIn summary - the entire premise of objectivity proper is that subjective biases exist and we are trying to control for them through specific communal methodologies and diverse dialectics. \n\nMisunderstanding this leads to overly simplified ideas such as \u201cone person can\u2019t be objective, therefore all there is is subjectivity\u201d.\n\nIt also overlooks the fact that while no group of humans can be perfectly objective (ie none will hit 100%), they can collectively be closer to or further from away objectivity.\n\nFinally, I am not downplaying the value of emotional subjectivity it is to our being human. We need both. I am merely clarifying what I find to be a consistent abuse of the idea of objectivity.

The frustration of the needs not to suffer and not to have one\u2019s autonomy dwarfed should, prima facie, be decreased. When decreasing the need frustration of some would increase the need frustration of others, the case is deferred and a fuller ethical analysis is conducted.

Many people applauded this good behavior, but some (on the internet of course) saw important moral problems.\n\nThe most honest objection to such behavior, I think, lies in the idea that there is something wrong in using people('s suffering) to produce content for entertainment. To me, this seems like a pure deontological constraint. If we take this constraint seriously, we can understand how a good deed like paying for the medical expenses of other people can appear morally dubios.\n\nAre such deontological constraints enough to make the action -overall- morally wrong? Here, I don't see how we can escape consequentialist reasoning and the weighing of the bad of using people for content, and the good of donating money to people in need. In this specific case, the weighing appears to end in favor of Mr. Beast. But that strongly depends on the details of the case, so I would grant the critic that in some cases, the deontological constrains are important enough to warrant a more critical judgment of behavior that would be justified from a purely consequentialist position.","upvotes":25,"created_utc":1676755750.0},{"author":"BigDanDizzle","text":"All the legitimate pieces of shit and scammers on Youtube but this dude's moral compass is what keeps you up at night?","upvotes":12,"created_utc":1676817890.0},{"author":"Rowan-Trees","text":"\\[not necessarily my own views. I support what Mr. Beast is doing.\\]\n\nThere is an argument to be made that someone doing good out of self-interested goals, the *effectiveness* of said good can only, at best, be a secondary consideration after the self-interest, and it does not necessarily even need to be a factor at all. They could even do harm, if they still achieve their personal ends. Thus, it is not an effective\/reliable model for ethics.\n\nex. A philanthropist builds wells in developing countries for PR. Because he is doing it for the PR, it is not necessarily important if those wells are what the communities actually need, or are even helpful in the first place. They could even do *harm* in the long-term.\n\nFurther; if a more effective way to help is *less popular* (or even *unpopular*) to do, then the philanthropist is *disincentivized* to do the more effective thing. Lastly; offering *permanent solitons* to social ills can be seen as *undesirable*, as it eliminates the needys' dependency on the philanthropists for future good-deeds. It would be na\u00efve of us to think large NGO's that depend on reliable donation-flows, do not take these sorts of calculations into account when the board makes decisions on how to distribute aide.\n\nThus, the argument \"what does it matter one's motivations for doing good, if the results are the same?\" is only valid in a vacuum.

No matter what kind of disarray you've made in your bedroom, you still like what you've done to your closet. And no matter how neat and tidy your closet is, you're not going to like that you've made a mess of your bedroom. Clean the closet and dirty the bedroom, clean the bedroom and dirty the living room, clean the house and dirty the neighborhood, build cities and dirty the environment.\n\nDoing \"good\" is about creating order, whether it's organizing a closet or fixing disordered eyeballs.

Living beings are essentially little entropy pumps, creating little pockets of order while necessarily driving the whole system toward disorder, the same way a refrigerator creates a local pocket of cold whole producing more net heat in the larger scope.\n\nWe can both like the fact that some people got their eyes fixed and hate that it was accomplished by perpetuating the whole wasteful, toxic, voyeuristic ad-driven incentive model.\n\nThe distinction between means and ends is wholly artificial and imaginary, i.e. it exists only as an artifact of planning. Closer to reality is the notion that every action carries with it a cloud of scoped and charged (good, bad, neutral) probabilities that social contract expects us to foresee and acknowledge.

The market is not concerned with providing for everyone but will still do more to provide for most people than any other system we tried in the same environment.

He is paying for eye surgery to restore sight. What are the ends? Well we have two. First we have Mr Beast getting video content that he later monetizes. But what else do we have? Everyone videoed is getting life improving eyesight restoration. No one can question how they feel about that, their emotions are raw and available by the first ends. \n\nSo did we satisfy Kant's declaration? Well some people gave up a bit of privacy. Not much, we didn't get their names, their address, where they live, or anything personal they didn't choose to share. For that they got their sight restored which will impact every waking moment of the rest of their lives. It will allow them to be independent, to work, some for the first time. Clearly the humanity of these recipients is honored. I would even say to them, they would say they have received more than the value of the content they gave to Mr Beast. \n\nNow here is the next question. The content one person gave by allowing the video, and to be clear we saw only a SMALL fraction of the people that had their sight restored. The vast majority got treatment without giving up anything. It was just a straight no strings attached donation. But how many of the people that allowed the video would do so or even demand so if they knew making the video would generate funds that would help pay for others to get the same benefit. How many would be livid if they were denied the opportunity to make a contribution so that others could get what they got? \n\nThe vast majority of the people that seem to hate on this video and situation are not able to grasp the larger situation. They get upset that people are blind in the first place. They are angry that everyone doesn't all they free health care they need or want. This is just being angry the world isn't a utopia. If you want to have that anger go ahead but it isn't rooted in reality and it isn't going to do much to make anyone's life better least of all yours. Mr Beast could just do silly game shows, and rake in the money, giving a bit away as prizes and be done with it. That's what day time television has done for decades. But here takes some of the money he has earned along supplemented with money earned by the content of the project and given what no one can deny is a great gift to a huge number of people. That is in it self a good thing. Could more people be served? Sure. Could an anonymous donor pay for everyone surgery? Maybe.

When we cannot do, we don't think if we invented the apple but rightly assume that society wasn't introduced to apple (like we weren't to potatoes or tomatoes before the plundering of Americas). The language of mathematics is more precise and less arbitrary than the natural language used to communicate about apple(s), so it's hard to understand what his point is apart from the fact that humans are cultural animals, whatever we do is tainted\/or excelled by our partial cultural-social background, and that is also the main reason why we are able to have a healthy discussion about universals (including universal values like human rights) because the right way to write a Universal Declaration of Human rights, for example, entails a healthy multiplicity of opinions that contribute to the discussion.

The canonical texts in the Abhidharma Buddhist tradition, endorse hiri as one of the wholesome (kusala) factors \u201calways found in all good minds\u201d and as one of \u201cthe guardians of the world\u201d. Shame is widely taken to be a self-conscious emotion, and so if hiri counts as shame, this seems to be in tension with the central Buddhist claim that we should rid ourselves of the idea that there is a self. Buddhist moral education seems to promote an emotion that fundamentally presupposes something that Buddhist metaphysics fundamentally rejects: a self. This puzzle provides the motivation for our paper, and we will argue for a new understanding of hiri that also has implications for how we should think about one important \u201cself-conscious\u201d moral emotion, guilt. This puzzle about the Buddhist tradition also raises a basic philosophical question: What kinds of moral emotions are theoretically consistent with the denial of a self?

Who knows if it even exists when we can't even define it? Well, I see one way we could at least find a practical, yet inaccurate, definition of what consciousness might be and most of us already use it. When talking about consciousness, we apply some sort of cultural code that assumes a set of characteristics that within our culturally influenced language model defines the word \"consciousness\". We all have an idea of what it means even though each idea is a variation from the idealistic appearance of consciousness in reality (see Plato's Theory of Forms).  \nThis would further be interesting to keep in mind when saying that the sheer simulation of consciousness wouldn't be \"real\" consciousness. Isn't real consciousness a simulation after all?  \nSo the first important question to me is if our individual idea of consciousness is even accurate enough to assess if something is conscious. Am I really sure that I am conscious? How many times have I made a seemingly conscious decision that later turned out to be a complete illusion? Like actually wanting to impress someone or satisfy a certain need.  \nHowever, culturally we do define some characteristics as indicators of consciousness. As mentioned in the video, individual experiences such as taste or aspirations could be indicators of consciousness. But how come we as humans develop such individual perceptions of reality? I think the answer to that could easily be applied to machines as well. One of the conditions leading to individual perceptions is the individual physical entities that we are. Every person is indeed uniquely built and even small variations (even randomly) can lead to different experiences which then leads to individual definitions of what e.g. broccoli tastes like. Imagine making small random variations in a computer code or the hardware.  \nImagine having a computer with 1.000.000 different sensors for tasting and every 10th sensor is slightly different calibrated. This computer would then only have an idea of what broccoli could taste like for another computer. In combination with a culturally influenced data set and language model, they would only give individually different answers and be \"aware\" of their individual experience when the context is given to their experience.  \nI think what many people forget about when it comes to consciousness is that many things that we define as indicators are the result of flaws in our individual beings. It's the lack of perfection, the tiny random variations in us, and the individual different data set that each of us has been trained upon because we all make different experiences. To me, these things are the essentials to create what we perceive\/define as consciousness, and being human or biological entities is nothing special about it.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1676489952.0},{"author":"Shiny_metal_ass","text":"My cat is conscious, but if I'm as conscious to an AI as a cat is to me, there's no point in even trying.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1676490117.0},{"author":"chuffmunky","text":"Sure, like the only way to answer such a question is to philosophise about it.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1676491839.0},{"author":"Daotar","text":"Idk.

Because it recognises the the pointlessness of discussing a topic without agreed definitions. This is most often epitomised with possibly the most boring question in the universe 'do you believe in god'. I can't believe that people endlessly discuss this, completely oblivious of any need for definition of words.\n\nAnd these definitions require separate discussion first. Having said that, the two questions that are linked are 1. what is consciousness and 2. what fundamentally exists. \n\nI'm not going to go very deeply into this other than to say the OP recognises the need for a definition before discussion but then asks the very question that he\/she\/they has said is futile.  Nevertheless I will respond.\n\nHoffman in the video starts out correctly that space and time are not fundamental but then just goes a little deeper down the same rabbit hole. For example we thought the atom was fundamental until it wasn't, the proton was fundamental until it wasn't and Hoffman now wants to continue down this road which is obviously a road that we keep extending along with our technology.\n\nSo I am first going to give a definition of Consciousness for the purposes of the discussion of whether a machine can be conscious. \n\nThe answers are symbiotically related to the question of 'what do I mean by 'I'. Who or what exactly is 'I'. \n\nThis has all been microscopically analysed in rigorous detail in the Indian traditional teachings of advaita vedanta, these traditional teachings have been taken and dispersed in a non traditional non didactic way by many and so traditional teaching, which necessitates rigorous definition of words and terms if forgone and it becomes a meaningless exercise in beliefs. \n\nTradition scholarly teaching begins by dividing the world first into three things, which encompass everything. I, not I, and god. What am I, what is the world, what is god, and what is the relationship between these three things.\n\nWe do not need to define god in this instance because with some further analysis we see that god is either you, or not you. If god is you, then we're done, god is I. \n\nIf god is not you, then we're also done because god is then 'not I'. So there is no third thing in the world, (world meaning anything and everything that can ever be). So we have dispensed with god, or rather rolled god into one of the two categories of existence. I and Not I.\n\nWe then discover that stuff can be subdivided unto more fundamental parts wood is fundamental, then wood becomes a form of a more fundamental structure which then becomes another form and then dissolves into more fundamental reality. So we went from protons to quarks, and wave functions and now we have discovered that stuff is in fact just a vibration in a field. Very soon, it is apparent that what is now fundamental only exists in the concepts in our mind. Max Tegmark postulates the universe is math, but again math is a concept that exists in mind. \n\nAnd so we see that there is only I, and so the question that Vedanta tackles 'what is 'I'. Is the fundamental question. \n\nOne way is to see what is not I... Anything that can be objectified by me cannot be I. There is no second I in the world. No one objectifies a second I. My thoughts are not I because I observe my thoughts, I know what I know I know what I don't know. And even if I could see into your thoughts, they would just be objects for me as they are for you. I, simply, is. \n\nThere is no 'therefore' I think therefore I am, is incorrect. It is simply... I am. I is. Conscious is. Existence is. \n\nI and Consciousness, and Existence are all synonyms for the same thing. The problem is that the person thinking about all this forgets that their thoughts and ideas are also not I. It's a reflexive problem, the camera cannot photograph it's own lens, except in a mirror. Similarly we can only understand I by reflecting I off something else we cannot objectify I any more than we can see our own eyes without using some other instrument. \n\nWhat makes a human being a human being is the ability to be fully conscious that it is a conscious being. This gives rise to all the human problems because  the problems of the body and mind get conflated with I. And it's a hot mess.\n\nSo if an AI machine somehow become fully conscious of it's own consciousness that would make the machine a human being by my definition and thus the machine would have the exact same problems as a human, it would become sad, because of its limitations. \n\nIn the final analysis all there there is is existence. There isn't anything else. And everything is but a form of this fundamental existence. It matters not how deep science goes. Let's say hypothetically we go back 'before' the big bang, lets say that brane theory is right and two smashed together and the big bang happened. So what, all we did was push it back a bit further, it's all still only exists in our mind. \n\nSo the definition of Consciousness is Existence and the two words are synonyms. Consciousness is not emergent it is fundamental, but this goes nowhere without first understanding 'what is I', because if that is not understood first we unwittingly take the reflection we see in the mirror as ourselves.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1676495205.0},{"author":"texmexdaysex","text":"What if AI \/ machine consciousness is emergent but the type of consciousness that we have is fundamental?

The neuroscientists\u2019 mistake of ascribing to the constituent parts of an animal attributes that logically apply only to the whole animal we shall call \u2018the mereological fallacy\u2019 in neuroscience.\n\n> The principle that psychological predicates which apply only to human beings (or other animals) as wholes cannot intelligibly be applied to their parts, such as the brain, we shall call \u2018the mereological principle\u2019 in neuroscience.\n\n> Human beings, but not their brains, can be said to be thoughtful or to be thoughtless; animals, but not their brains, let alone the hemispheres of their brains, can be said to see, hear, smell and taste things; people, but not their brains, can be said to make decisions or to be indecisive.\n\nSo the basic idea of the mereological fallacy (which is what the author may be committing) is claiming parts are responsible for something only the whole they are a part of can be responsible for. In neuroscience, the brain is the particular part that gets ascribed characteristics only the whole body or person can be responsible for.\n\nI think it's easiest to deal with from the first person, since figuring out whether other people are doing things involves a variety of concerns about inferring mental activity from observed bodily behavior - though the issue is still pertinent there.\n\nLet's just jump into some issues that just the basic first personal claim that \"I think my brain is thinking\" gives rise to. These are just questions to ask yourself for the sake of figuring out how to make sense of a person, a brain, and their status as either part or whole and how they can relate in a way that makes sense.\n\n* Is my brain equivalent to my thinking, my activity in general, myself? How could it even still be just one part of a person's body if it's a whole person? Is it both a part and a whole, somehow? In what respects, such that this wouldn't be a contradiction?\n\n* If I just were a brain, would I be part of a body that isn't my own? What of the other body parts, are they part of me or are they just sort of tools for me as a brain? How would sensation even work if that's all they are? My eyes and my brain are both important for a whole person to see colors on a theory that considers them parts, but if the brain is the whole person how does the affectation of the eye result in a brain's experience of color?\n\n* What happens as a brain changes? If a brain is a body part of a whole person, that person can stay the same as experiencing subject as their brain develops, changes, etc. The person as a whole accounts for the unity of the body and the experiences resulting from its changes all being a process of a single subject. But if I am my brain, wouldn't I just cease to be when my brain changes, and some other brain-person would pop into being upon the instantiation of the new brain structure?\n\n* What determines the limit of a body or body part? Why do we decide the brain material stops here, the eye material stops here, the whole person's body stops here, etc.? Why is it not just an arbitrarily selected aggregate of atomistic pieces of stuff any way you slice it?\n\nMinimally, we can say the mereological fallacy is a criticism of a way of treating these kinds of questions that some philosophers believe does not make sense.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1676556212.0},{"author":"itsgabrielsimao","text":"The brain activity spiked so early before the decision was made because the person just wanted to continue browsing to make sure that truly was the pair of headphones they wanted.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1676566735.0},{"author":"ifoundit1","text":"That would mean someone may be having it or attempting to have it for us instead of it being a gift to us.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1676569003.0},{"author":"Mikeoxard411","text":"there are many things in our life that we are unable to control, and our conscious or meaningful decisions are influenced by uncontrollable circumstances we find ourselves in.

I am not saying society should get to dictate couples based on the utility of children to society.**\n\nthose are not nearly the same situation judging old people, gay people,  divorced people, infertile people, or childless people could put a severe mental strain on something they can't really avoid and that can happen to anyone, while the societal backlash to inter cousin marriages comes from taking genetic and related risks that would not even be present if the person stopped being lazy, got their ass of their family  tree, touched grass and saw how they could get with one of many fish on  the sea that are less troublesome for you and everyone involved (and I  wasn't saying to ban the practice since I agree the government  shouldn't decide who marries who, I was only defending it is immoral and  shouldn't be socially encouraged)\n\n**So based on that, I do think the genetic problems are not the only reason people are not fans of cousin marriages**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhere is some objections I have gotten from this argument, and my answers to them\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Most of that boils down to \"may have problems\" which is nor really  immoral or gross.\n\nSame  can be said for interfaith couples, age gap couples, wealth or  education disparity couples and so on. It can be normal for some  relationships to both be more likely to lead to problems and yet be  completely fine for a couple of consenting adults\n\nthat's  a completely false dichotomy, I was making a cumulative case that  cousin marriages which have a higher likelihood to cause problems and  should be discouraged, but there is no reason to assume that one single  characteristic alone makes cousin marriages equivalent to the various  examples you listed\n\nI do think  it's entirely valid to certain religious communities to discourage  conflict in interfaith marriages, but that tabu is far from as widespread as the negative fame of incest, and there are good motives for that, not only does it have less likely inherent  risks (like it doesn't have the built-in power dynamics incest has), it also contributes to intercultural exposure and communication which is  commonly viewed as a positive and moral trait by many societies\n\nthe  same thing applies to wealth gap and education gap relationships, it  encourages intercultural exchange and dialogue, not to mention these two  particular ones also promote social mobility to the couple's offspring  which is a plus, it isn't a coincidence these examples are less tabu  then incestuous relationships, they have less downsizes and more  benefits\n\nand regarding the age gap  example is more useful for my argument than for yours being hones, I  mean certain age gaps are one of the most recurrent features people say  can be \"red flags\", that is not to say it can't work (I myself am a  child of a couple with 10 year age gap that have been a happily married  couple off more than 20 years that) but there is still a reason it is a  common tabu, depending on the age gap it can be a very big red flag that  includes a series of possible toxic traits built in (power dinamics and  the like) relationships, in general, are a case by case bases, but  expecting society not to produce backlash to general examples of things  it considers harmful is not realistic or even a good idea, a society  pasive to things it thinks are bad would not be helty (or are we going  to act like being nonjudgmental to relationships between a 14-year-old  and a 17-year-old just because it's legal would be okay and not a  complete case of societal negligence just because it has the super rare  possibility off being completely helty)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>people to know the stakes and to decide they're going through with their relationship anyway.The  whole shitty tendency of wholesale judging \"couples that are more  likely to have problems are gross and illegal\" is really annoying and  gross,\n\nI  am not even arguing it should be illegal, because that is something  which can be argued would be immoral to ban via juridical means with  stronger arguments, but acting like society judging it as an immoral  thing is not positive but harmful is completely backward, yes societal  norms are not inherently good, but in many cases, they do serve to  encourage optimal or moral behaviors\n\nI  mean I don't want to be mean, but I really don't see your point, I do  think discouraging activities that have a high chance of being harmful  and are also completely unnecessary in most cases, tend to be a moral action  for society to take even if it's not a judiciary law\n\n&#x200B;\n\nif you guys have anything to add it would be welcomed, and thanks for reading everything, and if you didn't the **tl;dr** is:\n\nincest can cause genetic problems\n\nincest also has common and likely built-in power dynamics in many cases because of the previously reestablished relationship and the different standing in both in their shared social group of the \"familly\"its\n\nit can cause a big impact on family relationships causing fallouts\n\nis an easily avoidable practice not worth the risk involved\n\ntherefore society should discourage the practice to reduce it's occurrences and their negative consequences","upvote_ratio":0.66,"created_utc":1676387164.0,"comments":[{"author":"No-Shelter6371","text":"It's important to understand the ethical problems of incest and why it is generally looked down upon in society.

The negative stigma surrounding incest is more widespread than interfaith marriages, for example, because interfaith marriages have fewer inherent risks and can promote intercultural exchange and communication.

I wonder how often we do this in life\u2026 when we experience something greater but based on our understanding of the language we\u2019ve learned; how often our perspective of that experience can be so limiting only for the mere fact of being limited by the language we know. If we experience something and can\u2019t provide the right language to give it meaning, does that diminish our experience?","upvotes":4,"created_utc":1676516253.0},{"author":"DarnisDarby","text":"Somewhat barely exploring philosophy with values I find to help.

But you won't find many people actively arguing that a field is fundamentally wrongheaded, that philosophy isn't relevant to a field, or that a field should be left to others. I contend that this is due to self-selection bias: only the people who think a field is worth philosophical study bother write about it, while other philosophers leave them to their own devices rather than expend time and resources trying to debunk the field - that would be a fast way to lose friends and goodwill. But this then gives the false impression to onlookers that philosophers as a community all accept at least the relevance of these fields. This can then be used as ammunition by anti-philosophers, who can pick the more ridiculous fields and laugh at them. This is unlike in (some of) the sciences where new paradigms are nigh-universally accepted to supercede old ones.\n\nEdit: This isn't to say no philosophers ever wrote criticism targeted at whole fields. They do, it happens. But only very occasionally, and you will have to dive deep into the archives to find it, because it is always vastly outweighed by the amount of research in the field, and at any point in time it will be almost impossible to find any active research being done to debunk fields as a whole.","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1676383504.0},{"author":"Masimat","text":"When does a consciousness permanently lose consciousness of their current brain and body?

Things we picked up as kids and never really questioned. Like what actually makes something 'bad' or 'good'? It seems like a pretty fundamental question, but no one can give a concrete answer... or can they?\r  \n\r  \nWell for many ancient people, the answer was simple: if something upsets the gods, it's bad. If it pleases them, it's good. Simple as. Didn't say bismillah before eating your dino nuggies? You're going to the slammer, Jimmy.\r  \n\r  \nBut we're not living in ancient times, and we have much more sophisticated ways of thinking about the world. We're living in the modern era, where science and logic reign supreme!\r  \n\r  \nSo why don't we use a logic to find what makes something 'bad'? Let's have a thought experiment. Let's say you have a flowerbed that you care for everyday. Now let's say, hypothetically, I were to walk over and take a giant shit in your flowers.\r  \n\r  \nWould that be 'bad'?\r  \n\r  \nNorton: well of course it would be bad\r  \n\r  \nMe: but why?\r  \n\r  \nN: because now all me flowers are fucked up\r  \n\r  \nM: what's so bad about that?\r  \n\r  \nN: well I worked hard on these flowers. You're really starting to piss me off\r  \n\r  \nM: ah so we're getting somewhere! Maybe what makes something bad is the 'negative emotion' it produces.\r  \n\r  \nI mean it makes sense, right? Negative emotion is something we're born with and understand pretty quickly. If we get punched in the face, it hurts and it's bad.\r  \n\r  \nThis idea is called 'consequentialism'. Something is bad because it has negative consequences.\r  \n\r  \nSo that's it. Negative emotion is bad. Period.\r  \n\r  \nWell, maybe not. Why do we have negative emotion in the first place? It should be pretty uncontroversial to say we evolved it to keep us safe. If our ancestors heard a predator rustling in the bushes \\[Dream\\], the ones with a greater fear response were more likely to run away faster and survive. It's natural selection.\r  \n\r  \nS: So hold on, if negative emotion is what helped us survive to this day, how is it bad?\r  \n\r  \nWell I don't think it's that negative emotion is bad, but that 'bad' is 'negative emotion', meaning it can be good as long as it ultimately produces more 'positive emotion' in the long-term, such as when it keeps us alive.\r  \n\r  \nThis idea is called 'utilitarianism'. Something bad can be justified if it's necessary for the 'greater good'. A utilitarian would switch the lever in the trolley problem, killing one person instead of four.\r  \n\r  \nBut let's go back to consequentialism for a second. Let's say it's 9am on a nice Tuesday morning, and you decide to rev up the Buga'i whey and go 200ks down the school zone. But let's say, due to the superior driving abilities you've gotten from playing endless hours of Mario Kart, you manage to not hit a single child in the endeavor, meaning your action had no negative consequences.\r  \n\r  \nIs that still wrong?","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1676850028.0},{"author":"DoctorDream614","text":"We could be in a simulation.

This is a little insight on the topic.\n\n\nThe concept of \"bruh moment\" has gained widespread popularity in recent times as a shorthand way to express disappointment, incredulity, or a sense of being let down by life. The phrase has become a common meme in online culture, and it encapsulates a certain kind of existential malaise that many people can relate to. But can life really be reduced to a series of \"bruh moments,\" or is there a deeper philosophical significance to this phrase?\n\nTo answer this question, we must first consider the nature of existence itself. From a philosophical perspective, existence can be seen as a kind of absurdity. We are thrown into the world without our consent, forced to grapple with a set of circumstances that we did not choose and may not be able to fully understand. This condition of being is often referred to as \"thrownness\" or \"facticity,\" and it is a central theme in the work of existentialist philosophers such as Martin Heidegger and Jean-Paul Sartre.\n\nWhen we look at life through this lens, it becomes clear that there are many moments that can be described as \"bruh moments.\" These are the times when we are confronted with the arbitrary and sometimes nonsensical aspects of our existence. For example, the death of a loved one, the end of a relationship, or the failure to achieve a desired goal can all be experienced as \"bruh moments.\" They are the moments when we are forced to confront the fact that life is not always fair, just, or predictable.\n\nBut why do we experience these moments as \"bruh moments\"? What is it about them that makes us feel a sense of disappointment, frustration, or even anger? One possible answer is that these moments represent a rupture in our expectations. We have certain beliefs and assumptions about how the world works, and when these beliefs are challenged or contradicted, we experience a kind of cognitive dissonance. This dissonance can lead to feelings of confusion, disillusionment, and even despair.\n\nAnother possible explanation for the prevalence of \"bruh moments\" in our lives is that they are a symptom of the alienation that many people feel in modern society. As we become more isolated and disconnected from one another, it can be difficult to find meaning or purpose in our lives. We may feel like we are adrift in a sea of uncertainty, with no clear path or direction. This sense of aimlessness can contribute to feelings of frustration and hopelessness, leading us to view life as a series of meaningless, arbitrary events.\n\nFrom a more metaphysical perspective, the concept of a \"bruh moment\" can be seen as an expression of the fundamental absurdity of existence. In a universe that is indifferent to our desires, hopes, and dreams, it can be difficult to find any kind of transcendent meaning or purpose. We may feel like our lives are a cosmic joke, a cruel prank played by an indifferent universe. This sense of futility and meaninglessness can be overwhelming, leading us to view life as a series of pointless, absurd events.\n\nIn conclusion, while the phrase \"bruh moment\" may seem flippant or lighthearted on the surface, it is actually a reflection of some of the deepest philosophical questions about the nature of existence. Whether we view life as a series of disappointments and setbacks, a symptom of modern alienation, or a cosmic absurdity, there is no denying the fact that there are many moments in our lives that can be described as \"bruh moments.\" While we may not be able to escape these moments entirely, we can take comfort in the knowledge that we are not alone in our struggle to find meaning and purpose in a world that often seems arbitrary and capricious.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1676729181.0},{"author":"scccls","text":"Thinking about the philosophy of war, is opening with aggression always the safest choice?

Camus comes and says that we **must** image Sisyphus as happy, and now I would want to argue that Sisyphus it's **indeed** happy.\n\nPsychologically, there is always a conflict between reality and our perspective (standards) about our reality. We can decide if we change reality to fit our perspective (standards) or if we come up with a perspective that embraces reality. Considering that Sisyphus has no alternative but only to push the rock, then reality can't be changed, thus - as a psychological mechanism - his perspective will embrace its current situation and will try to come up with self-defensive mechanisms to avoid mental health issues (e.g. erasing from his interests everything that can't be done considering its circumstances).\n\nNow, what Sisyphus does do? Right. It pushes a stone, infinitely. Good. Psychologically, we're happier when we pursue a goal than when we achieve it. Dopamine is what your brain releases when it anticipates a goal. Acknowledging that getting to the peak of the mountain, with the rock, won't achieve anything, Sisyphus must shift towards goals focused on himself and not the task per se (reaching the peak). This could be anything, but for the sake of it, let's come up with some easy ones: Physical, mental, and crafty goals.\n\nPhysical - Pushing the stone through a mountain requires stamina and strength. After each time it gets pushed, Sisyphus becomes stronger and faster on the task. There is no end point on how strong and fast you can become, so Sisyphus will never achieve this goal, the only thing he can do is strive for his ideal.\n\nMental - When you do something monotonous or mundane your brain switches off and gets into a deliberate thinking mode, thus, Sisyphus can think about many things and come up with his philosophy, which again, doesn't has limits and every day can be improved. This is like the last step into Maslow's hierarchy of needs, where one's self-actualization is the last thing that a person would be willing to do forever as long as his other needs are covered.\n\nCraftsy - Pushing the rock is not only a matter of physical endurance but also, it's what Sisyphus is settled up to do for his entire life. There are no alternatives, so Sisyphus must focus on his new and unavoidable duty. The more he'll try to come up with new ways to be more efficient at what he does (experimenting with different pushing techniques, with different paths on the mountain, etc.), the greater its engagement and flow state. Still, you can only go so far in terms of efficiency. But, when he reaches 100% efficiency with this goal, then he can shift towards the previous 2 (which is also the idea in one's life, when there's no more room for learning or improvement, you find happiness by pursuing something else).\n\nAt the end of the day, this only shows that what Sisyphus does it's just a task, and the way he decides to approach will ultimately determine his emotional state. So the entire point of Sisyphus, in my opinion, is not to show that life is meaningless and assume that someone is happy with this meaninglessness, but instead, he must understand why they're happy with this meaningless and see how their ideas, perspectives, thoughts, etc. differ from ours.\n\nEven those that may say that this argument holds true only if we see Sisyphus as some type of Nietzschean ideal, and not in a scenario where Sisyphus is interested in beauty, for example. Well, Sisyphus can definitely appreciate the natural beauty that surrounds its mountain (sky, animals, nature, etc.), but he has no means to express it. Again, because Sisyphus can't change his circumstances, he must lower his aspirations if he is a rational individual.\n\n*Disclaimer: I didn't study philosophy. I'm an amateur.

Once pain or pleasure go away you have no memory of what it felt like. General mood is the same.

For example, tadpoles with scrambled craniofacial organs remodel into largely normal frogs (Vandenberg et al., 2012), and geckos can regenerate missing limbs.\n\nAnother type of morphological intelligence is the ability to remodel oneself for the purpose of solving a different task in the 3D (traditional behaviour) space. An example is insect [metamorphosis](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Metamorphosis), which insects undergo to spread, find mating partners, and reproduce.\n\nIf we assume consciousness [functionalism](https:\/\/plato.stanford.edu\/entries\/functionalism\/), undergoing a metamorphosis for the purpose of achieving a *psychological* goal of *experiencing another agent\u2019s qualia and emotions* should be a possible feat for an AI which is at least as powerful as to be able to perform [whole brain emulation](https:\/\/www.lesswrong.com\/tag\/whole-brain-emulation) (or, perhaps, whole organism emulation) and then live through an episode of the organism\u2019s life in a simulated environment.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether it is possible to retain and be able to retrieve a conscious memory of \u201cwhat is it like to be a bat\u201d (or human, or another form of AI) after the AI remodels itself back into its \u201cbase\u201d morphology. The retention of symbolic or \u201cindexical\u201d memories should be possible (Hammelman et al., 2016), but the minimal physicalism theory of consciousness ([Fields et al., 2021](https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/nc\/article-abstract\/2021\/2\/niab013\/6334115)) suggests that interpreting any state (including recorded memories) through morphologically different computational networks (quantum reference frames) entails different conscious experiences (note: this is my interpretation of the minimal physicalism theory, not a statement made by the authors of the theory).\n\nRegardless, even if retaining the memory of qualitative experience through morphological remodellings is impossible, it should be possible for the AI to **emulate the brains of two organisms of different species at the same time and integrate them into a single conscious experience**. This AI could live through a simulation episode with the experiences of two organisms that we want to weigh (for the purposes of ethical decision-making) both happen at the same time, e.g., a fish being caught and killed, and a human enjoying eating that fish in a restaurant. Then, we can ask this AI whether killing fish for people\u2019s pleasure is moral or not (provided that the AI is also equipped with a [scale-free theory of ethics](https:\/\/www.lesswrong.com\/posts\/opE6L8jBTTNAyaDbB\/a-multi-disciplinary-view-on-ai-safety-research#3_1__Scale_free_axiology_and_ethics)).\n\nTherefore, given the human brain\u2019s low capability for morphological remodelling and thus low capacity for empathy on the absolute, non-speciesist scale, it seems ethically **inappropriate that humans remain \u201cin the driving seat\u201d in what comes to ultimate moral decision-making in the future advanced civilisation**. This also casts doubt on the idea of \u201c[coherent extrapolated volition](https:\/\/www.lesswrong.com\/tag\/coherent-extrapolated-volition)\u201d (CEV), which would, as usually conceptualised, be incapable of extrapolating beyond the human capacity for universal empathy. (This is not my only reason to think that CEV doesn't make sense.

Focusing exclusively on the question of harm treats what procreators owe their offspring as akin to what they would owe strangers (if they owe them anything at all). Procreators, however, usually expect (and are expected) to parent the persons they create, so we cannot understand what procreators owe their offspring without also appealing to their role as prospective parents. I argue that prospective parents can wrong their future children just by failing to act well in their role as parents, whether or not their offspring are ultimately harmed or benefitted by their creation. Their obligations as prospective parents bear on the motivations behind their reproductive choices, including the choice to select for some genetic trait in their offspring. Even when procreators\u2019 motivations aren\u2019t malicious, or purely selfish, they can still fail to recognize and act for the end of the parental role. Procreators can wrong their offspring by selecting for some genetic trait, then, when doing so would violate their obligations as prospective parents, or when their motivation for doing so is antithetical to the end of the parental role.","upvotes":10,"created_utc":1676228014.0},{"author":"AConcernedCoder","text":"I was going to argue that, taken to an extreme, this angle could be argued against the procreative rights of a minority in a culture that is hostile toward that minority, but you summed up fairly nicely with this:\n\n>Deaf parents who select for deafness because they think it\u2019s in their child\u2019s interest, or because they think it will better enable them to be good parents to the child, at least act for the right kind of (parental) reason.  \n>  \n>...  \n>  \n>Using a role-based framework in procreation cases allows us to think about the morality of procreation in terms of the relation between procreators and their offspring without first locating a harm to the person created.\n\nAnd I think that you may have a good point.  For all we know, survival in a world with such a disability may require strategies  and traits that are often overlooked.  IVF is another matter, but the selection of the deaf parents is an interesting example w.r.t. evolutionary theory, and I have to wonder, assuming that the deaf parents sincerely acted on their preferences and that our preferences are themselves subject to evolutionary pressures, if this is more accurately interpreted as a good example of a pathway in an evolutionary search for traits that are favored outside of the conventional social expectation.\n\nWe probably can't know that for certain but it's interesting food for thought.","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1676238523.0},{"author":"soldout","text":"When selecting which embryos to use in an IVF, there is no child yet. Any embryo that we could reasonably expect to have a life preferable to non-existence, would be better off being born. But we can only select a subset of those viable embryos, so the question becomes if some of those embryos are still preferable to others.\n\nIn this situation, the author claims that a deaf parent could prefer a deaf child because the deaf parent would be in a better position to discharge their parental obligations. On this view, which embryo to implant should be decided based on how the expected properties of the child (being deaf, say) would impact how well the parent accomplished their parental duty. But only in those cases. She writes the following:\n\n> For instance, selecting for a disability as a means to grow the community of persons with that disability isn\u2019t the right kind of reason to justify a choice on behalf of one\u2019s future child. Prospective parents shouldn\u2019t enter the parental role with a child merely as a means to serve the interests of some group.[34] Nor should prospective parents select for deafness to, by way of a permanent physical trait, ensure that their children will be members of their own cultural community. Parents may have a legitimate interest in sharing what they care about with their children as part of the parent-child relationship, but they do not have a blanket permission to do whatever they can to ensure that their child will come to share their beliefs and values. Indoctrinating one\u2019s child can make it easier to include him in one\u2019s religious practices and to ensure his continued participation, but that doesn\u2019t permit a parent to indoctrinate her child.[35] In the same way, deaf parents are not permitted to select for deafness as a way of ensuring that their children remain a part of the Deaf community.\n\nIt's an interesting point, but it could potentially rule out selecting any embryo with a disability. Prospective parents might claim they could better parent a child with a disability, but as the author makes clear, parental duty entails more than that. Detailing this out could very well result in the position that prospective parents are never justified in selecting an embryo with a disability.\n \nUltimately, other considerations are more salient in embryo selection. Remember that the pool we are selecting from is populated by embryos who would all be better off being born. Some disabilities (like deafness) are not severe enough to warrant exclusion at this juncture, so they would still be in the pool. \n\nAs mentioned in the article, in the arguments made against selecting for disability, prospective parents can be charged with failing to bring about some optimal state of affairs. This kind of argument appeals to wider considerations about how genetic properties affect the potential well-being of the child and society as a whole. Whatever the optimal state of affairs might be, this view would at least have to rule out intentionally selecting an embryo with a disability over an embryo without a disability (ceteris paribus).\n\nIf we want to pursue this view, I think we have to commit to the position that it\u2019s better to be without a disability. To argue that position, we might be able to make some general points, but I suspect that we would be better off treating this on a case-by-case basis. \n\nThe article focuses on deafness, so let\u2019s consider that. Is hearing a significant good? I think it\u2019s hard to argue against it. Hearing allows important ways of communication, opens you up to many positive experiences (like music), helps you navigate your surroundings, etc. It\u2019s an ability that provides plenty of function and enjoyment. Being without it constitutes a serious lack. All things being equal, I have a hard time seeing how one could prefer deafness to hearing.\n\nFor deaf parents to argue that their child would be better off being deaf, the significant loss constituted by lack of hearing would have to be compensated by a comparable gain. Deaf parents who want a deaf child believe their ability to fulfill their parental duty is much improved if the child is deaf. That difference in parental ability would have to result in a gain to the child that favorably compares to the ability to hear. Certainly, the relationship between the parent and the child may be easier to manage, and perhaps closer, as a result of them all being deaf, but is that gain comparable to being able to hear? And is that gain even a certainty? I don't see it.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1676313316.0}]},{"title":"Frictionless Technologies: The Innovation of Human Obsolescence - Digital\/Virtual networks dehumanizing humanity in the post-info world","author":"Original_Ad_1103","url":"https:\/\/www.antitechcollective.com\/_files\/ugd\/7476b9_006efd013a1847839fe43720e822a34c.pdf","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.74,"created_utc":1676227653.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"You're probably a eugenicist","author":"4r530n","url":"https:\/\/dissentient.substack.com\/p\/eugenicist","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.54,"created_utc":1676217218.0,"comments":[{"author":"BernardJOrtcutt","text":"Please keep in mind our first commenting rule:\n\n> **Read the Post Before You Reply**\n\n> Read\/listen\/watch the posted content, understand and identify the philosophical arguments given, and respond to these substantively.

Gilman, Carole Blair, David J. Parent*\n\n**Nietzsche\u2019s On Rhetoric and Language - Parts I & II**\n\n**Notes** \n\n**Part I: The Concept of Rhetoric**\n\nIn this introductory lecture, Nietzsche journeys us through different time periods and provides us with the most prevalent attitudes towards rhetoric, the most accepted definitions of it, and its most established uses. With this lecture, Nietzsche aims to help us conceptualise what rhetoric is for ourselves.\n\n* **The ancient attitude as opposed to the modern one:**\n\nWe first distinguish between an ancient attitude towards rhetoric and a modern one. With \u201cancient\u201d we refer to the Greeks and Romans, while with modern we mean the period from the enlightenment onwards.\n\nFor the ancients, notes Nietzsche, education culminates in rhetoric. As he puts it \u201crhetoric was the highest spiritual activity of the well-educated political man.\u201d On the other hand, the moderns view rhetoric as a skill for shysters and crooks.\n\nThis difference in attitude, Nietzsche grounds primarily on the observation that the moderns have a more developed drive to look for the truth as opposed to the ancients. The ancients preferred rather to be persuaded, charmed, won over by a charismatic figure. To substantiate the above observation, Nietzsche contrasts the modern demand for historical accuracy with the free play of myths and legends in which the ancients engaged.\n\nTo gain a better understanding of rhetoric, Nietzsche concludes, we had better focus on ancient thinkers.\n\n* **The Greek attitude as opposed to the Roman:**\n\nNietzsche finds the Greek attitude towards rhetoric as best described by Kant when he says \u201crhetoric is the art of transacting a serious business of the understanding as if it were a free play of the imagination.\u201d *(a critique of Judgment)* Nietzsche further describes this attitude as \u201cessentially democratic\u201d and adds that \u201cone must be accustomed to tolerating the most wild opinions, and even take pleasure in their counterplay.\u201d Later on in the lecture, he emphasises again \u201cIn the sense of the Greeks, rhetoric is free play in the business of the understanding.\u201d\n\n*Comment: This attitude locates both its birthplace and highest expression in democratic Athens. A great illustration of this we find in Plato\u2019s Symposium.*\n\nNow, in Roman hands rhetoric finds its highest expression as the means with which powerful political personalities reinforced their commanding dominance over their subjects and aligned them to their will. This Roman attitude towards rhetoric Nietzsche finds Schopenhauer to best express when he says:\n\n\u201cIt is the faculty of stirring up in others our view of a thing\u2026 kindling in them our feeling about it\u2026 by conducting the stream of our ideas into their heads by means of words, with such force that this stream diverts that of their own thoughts\u2026 and carries it with it along its own course.\u201d *(The world as Will and Representation)*\n\n*Comment: Julius Caesar\u2019s account of the Gallic wars is in a sense itself an example of this attitude towards rhetoric. For speeches of this sort, I am more keen to point to the speeches of Athenian and Spartan personalities as rendered in Thucydides\u2019 Peloponnesian war (e.g. the speeches of Alcibiades and Nicias when Athens tries to reach a decision about embarking on the Sicilian expedition.)*\n\n*Proposition: This dimension of rhetoric is now no longer limited to the sphere of politics. It has found a great nesting place in the hands of corporations who use it to get us to buy their products. We call it advertising. What do you think?*\n\n* **In search of a definition:**\n\nWe have so far covered general attitudes towards rhetoric. Nietzsche now wants us to consider particular instances of definitions. He walks us from the earliest Greek attempts to articulate what rhetoric is all the way to the latest Roman ones. To survey all the definitions, do read Nietzsche\u2019s text directly. It is itself a summary.\n\n**Part II: The Division of Rhetoric and Eloquence**\n\nAs rhetoric catches on, we find the ancients treating it less as a talent or ability and more as a field of study. This movement manifests itself in the form of a system of classifications and methodologies which progressively expand as they seek to define both typical and experimental instances of rhetoric in use by coming up with increasingly more nuanced characteristics to look at.\n\nIn summary form, Nietzsche mentions (i) classifications of rhetorical speeches according to to their purpose, (ii) divisions of the rhetorical prose in constituting parts, (iii) divisions of the process of preparing and delivering a rhetorical speech in activities and tasks, (iv) distinctions of the ways one may learn rhetoric and so on.\n\n**Commentary**\n\n**Plato's Sabre - Aristotle's Definition - Nietzsche's Insight**\n\nThe rhetorician emerges out of a world where politics is carried out sword in hand and introduces a politics that is carried out sword in tongue. Weaving words and emotions with their voice, capable rhetoricians give an external form to their will and plant it into the hearts of others. They describe themselves as craftsmen who produce a speech, i.e. logos, which influences and persuades, shifts the attention of the listeners away from one thing and toward another, structures and restructures the fundamental organisation of social relationships in a community. It is no wonder that until Plato rhetoric and politics appeared as one thing.\n\nAs rhetoric develops in the big city-states of ancient Greece, so do the effects of this practice become more noticeable as well as its limitations. In his dialogues, Plato wields Socrates as a sabre and comes at the rhetoricians with vengeance. He hacks at rhetoric and methodically severs it into several pieces. Out of what was once rhetoric, Plato distinguishes politics, philosophy, the dialectic, instruction or teaching, even the concept of truth. He brings about the conditions for all of these pieces to gain a life of their own and grow by themselves. Yet, as he embodies his extremely critical position against rhetoric, he makes it appear as though its offspring not only preceded it but is also its opposite.\n\nDialogue after dialogue we eventually come to Aristotle who defines rhetoric as \u201cthe power (faculty, ability) to observe all possible means of persuasion about each thing\u2026 which can be elevated to a techne (art)\u201d. In Aristotle rhetoric finds its proportion and place. Later classical writers either try to expand on its practical aspects or merely express their bias against it.\n\nNietzsche, however, with his bird\u2019s eye view, notices that rhetoric is still alive and well within all of its offspring.\n\n*The more abstract the truth you wish to teach, the more you must still seduce the senses to it.

The argument is interesting, but I\u2019m afraid that global poverty is too complex an issue to yield to such straightforward arguments. The claim seems to be that the global poor is justified in taking from the global rich to save their own lives. \n\n> We know, however, that the wealthy citizens or countries are not doing nearly enough to help. And the poor are confronted with a whole lot of violence: they are being chased from their squatting places, arrested for petty theft, and incarcerated when they attempt to cross a border in search for a better life.\n\nI am no expert on global poverty or development, but from what I\u2019ve been able to understand, poor countries struggle because they are not able to develop stable institutions. I don\u2019t see how the poor taking from the rich is going to help with that. It\u2019s not a solution to global poverty, unless you want to move all the poor people to rich countries (which might very well destabilize institutions in rich countries, resulting in even more poverty).\n\n> Chapter 5 argues that the poor should not only be entitled to take what they need to survive but also things that may indirectly serve to obtain the former, such as money or a piece of land. It then explains that the right is a privilege or liberty to act, together with duties of others not to interfere with the action. The remainder of the chapter outlines three conditions for the right to be invoked, namely that the need must be basic, that no other equally important moral interests are violated in the exercise of the right, and that it is appealed to as a last resort.\n\nGiven the fact that the review doesn\u2019t elaborate on those three conditions, it\u2019s hard to know what the author thinks the poor are entitled to in our world. Pragmatically, I would be very skeptical about any agenda arguing that the global poor are entitled to the property of rich countries. For one, it\u2019s not close to being realistic. That could be excused if this was merely a thought experiment, but it appears that the book is intended to have real world application. In that case, realism is very relevant.\n\nSecondly, I think the approach is wrong-headed. Wealth, as a modern phenomenon, is the result of a mixture of technological and institutional developments that is only vaguely understood. What I mean is, we have no real blueprint of a functioning society where we could delineate every necessary and sufficient condition that have to be met. What we can do is point to what seems to work, but we don\u2019t know if we have all the actual underlying factors at hand, and we don\u2019t even know how to easily implement what seems to work to any given society.\n\nGlobal poverty has seen a massive decrease in recent decades. We might be thinking it should go even faster, and I\u2019m sure it could, but I don\u2019t think the proposal made in the book is the right way to go.","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1676134301.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1676051473.0}]},{"title":"Sustaining Ranci\u00e8re: Organising Dissent and Aestheticizing Equality (Part 1\/3)","author":"jmsfx27","url":"https:\/\/tektology.substack.com\/p\/sustaining-ranciere-organising-dissent","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1676049638.0,"comments":[{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1676051514.0}]},{"title":"Freedom is found beyond dualism : Frithjof Bergmann\u2019s model of freedom from a nondual perspective.","author":"Gloomy_Scene126","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/indian-thoughts\/what-is-freedom-f5ac8a915869","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1675960173.0,"comments":[{"author":"varmisciousknid","text":"This was a great read.

For example, that Ulrich is so self-consciousness of himself and his bodily sensations, gestures, that he cannot even walk down the street anymore. \n\nThis hyper self-consciousness allows many a Schizophrenic to perceive, at times, many more possibilities than the \"normal\" person, but, nevertheless, sometimes they perceive too much that they become slow or indecisive. \n\nSo yes, maybe herdness keeps individuals from going insane, from fracturing, from becoming more Schizophrenic (and really I think most mental illnesses (neurological, et cetera) cannot be so statically divided: each seems to work with one another but then at times to tilt a certain way bringing out those characteristics which do allow for a label, but only so). \n\nThose falling under the category of Schizophrenics are fractured because their internal self-regulation does not tend to a central point.

Believe in what you are doing at all costs (I think it was GH Hardy, for example, who wrote that the mathematician must believe his discipline superior to all others.

Follow those guidelines or \"rules for success\" that will boost your confidence and lead you to lead your \"best life\" (a checklist). You see, all of this is without. But once someone starts questioning these points (ex. do these \"rules for health actually help me or do they only seem to work because I expect them to and how could I differentiate this?\", et cetera), a fracturing begins. An uncertainty starts settling in. The chances of \"insanity\" become more and more likely. \n\nIn the context of Nietzsche, perhaps at this point the individual must be the first to take his\/her path, as he wrote of Schopenhauer (when he was was really speaking of himself as in a letter of Peter Gast) in Schopenhauer as Educator.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1676066151.0},{"author":"Always-sortof","text":"I would disagree.

Even if this were the case, the herd has hardly kept mankind from going insane but have only acted as a conduit for the leading ideology of their times. What's worse, multiple societies in the second half of the 20th century have tried to emulate Hitler's example with support from the mob, fully knowing the pitfalls. The superfluous mob, in many cases, tends to act against their own interests in favor of believing nasty vitriol. This, I would argue, implies that the mob has barely any part to play in maintaining the sanity of society unless directed through solid rhetoric.

Your \"argument\" for suffering being intrinsically bad is, from what I can tell, simply that it is bad because our emotional states tell us it's bad. Let's assume this argument is valid. In that case, we must also grant that most people associate their own existence with a positive emotional state, often even when they're suffering.

Much like the rationalists and empiricists argued that *everything* came from reason and experience respectively, arguing that *every single matter of gender* is performative puts an incredible burden on her case. Even a single compelling counter-example undermines the main claim. I want to emphasize, however, that this is an issue I find is broadly present in a lot of philosophy. Maybe it's just because people want to make **bold** and **exciting** claims. Or maybe you need to do that to get published. I'm not sure of the more practical considerations at play for these philosophers.\n\nAnyway, as anyone who's not very dedicated to feminist ideology would see, my position here is very unambitious. I'm saying, essentially, that there are probably at least some aspects of gender\/sex that aren't performative - learned from society, or so on.\n\nWhat I would argue is pretty simple - because of some simple differences in men and women biologically, the greatest of which is childbirth, there has been a natural division of labour that's been present in nature since before we were even humans, and, over millennia that difference in division of labour has even caused us to evolve to have some biological differences (like how men tend to track motion better but women distinguish colour better. Differences in fat content and muscle mass, and so on).\n\nI think that what likely happened is that these differences generally worked their way into our cultures and became exaggerated and stereotyped over time. I think the fundamental differences are more of a matter of convenience of division of labour that became exaggerated over time - and this is why you'll also see in certain society that gender roles can be quite different. There are some differences, but they're more subtle than most people who believe in them make them out to be. Societies are typically what exaggerate them.\n\nNow if you want to get into semantics you could say that this practical division of labour is performative, but I would just say that I prefer to use the word practical because I think it's more indicative of what's really going on. Yes, people do perform to societal expectations, but people also make choices that are practical, and while that's less *dramatic and interesting*, I think it's at least part of the truth of the matter.\n\nOverall I'm still quite amenable to the position that a significant amount of gendered behaviour is performative; I just think that saying that all of it is is getting overly ambitious.","upvotes":38,"created_utc":1675934466.0},{"author":"GrandStudio","text":"\u201cButler reminds us that vulnerability is not all bad; it is what makes life possible.

Ultimately, Butler reminds us, often poetically, that to be fully ourselves, we need each other.\u201d\n\nThis is Butler\u2019s most important point. We are human beings dependent on each other for our very existence.

Every mammal has two sexes with different behaviors in each sex that evolved over time for the purpose of efficient reproduction. This is partly where gender stereotypes emerge, some of them are rooted somewhat in reality. E.g., females are more associated with caregiving because evolutionarily, it is costlier to produce eggs and females must be invested in raising their offspring for it to be worthwhile.

They want to fully embody what the feminine\/masculine hormones do to the body.\n\nI also find it odd that the word gender has been usurped to be defined as how one identifies instead of acknowledging that gender comes from the same root as generate\/genitals\/progeny.

Gender norms are largely about making it more likely this happens, and to encourage the parents to stay together and raise the resulting children.\n\nThat's the \"essential\" truth that matters. We already have a working model of how to solve an existential question.

Primatologist Frans de Waal, in his recent book \"Different,\" believes gender differences are likely explained at the Biological (i.e. cellular) level.  Peterson (who I know I will get hate for mentioning) but as a world leading clinician in personality, and highly cited, believes personality differences account for variance in gender expression, and that this is at least partially psycho-physiologically informed.   Peterson does support the idea of Gender being somewhat abstracted from biological sex surprisingly enough.\n\nEDIT: I see my point is debated thoroughly already in other threads.

A couple of examples:\n\n\u201cSay my wife is feeling tired and irritable. I can either, as a good Stoic, try to feel good about that, or I can get up from the lounge and bring her a glass of wine and some crackers with Taramasalata.\u201d\n\nNowhere in the Stoic philosophy does it suggest to \u201cfeel good\u201d about someone you love being angry or sad. Realizing that you are not in control of something outside of your own person does not mean to feel good of be happy no matter what.\n\nA good example would be your wife being sad and you not pretending you can control that by PRETENDING she stops, say because you are also tired. A good stoic would only focus on his own reaction, maybe by being a good person\/husband and being supportive, instead of implicitly pretending that she should not do that \u201cbecause you are my wife!!!\u201d.\n\nA good stoic would not get to the point of being too tired to NOT be supportive for his wife. \n\n\u201cThis leads us to the passivity problem. If we focus only on our character, reactions, and actions, as Stoicism proposes, and put no effort into things that lie beyond our direct control, it seems to me that a practising Stoic will remain passive in the face of major problems like climate change or social inequality.\u201d\n\nRealizing you are not in control of climate change does not mean you are automatically allowed to simply don\u2019t care about it, or contributing to making it worse, as the author implies.\n\nIt could mean to take the situation seriously enough to decide to change your own person and habits based on what society demands, but not seriously enough as to think that YOU have the power to change it personally.\n\nThe latter will grant you the feeling of impotency because, as we know, no single person is in charge of fixing climate change. No single person SHOULD even being in charge of that, even if it was possible.\n\nThinking that you have the power to fix things outside of your control is one of the most frequent and potent traps in human cognition. Recognizing this could lead you to maximize your positive impact, because you would focus on yourself without \u201cwasting\u201d energy fixing what you cannot possibly fix.\n\nSo focus on yourself and then have the biggest positive impact in the world. \n\nRealizing that you cannot control what you cannot control does NOT mean \u201cwho cares!!!!!\u201d.","upvotes":335,"created_utc":1675771500.0},{"author":"Underling9782","text":"Author simply does not understand Stoicism.","upvotes":64,"created_utc":1675776234.0},{"author":"Difficult-Air-981","text":"The first note to make would be that I am not sure you have the interpretation of passiveness in Stoicism right. If anything the Stoics used this exploration of what is or is not in our control for to 'overcome' and take control of certain issues in life. As well as this, I do not believe using Holliday as the bastion of Stoicism is correct. The way I describe his books on the Stoics are someone who has put a garishly green bath in an otherwise nice bathroom suite. His takes on Stoicism are not terrible, far from it, but it is clear he writes for mass appeal and it is very clear he comes from a marketing background. To what extent he is disseminating Stoicism and\/or vacuously marketing for mass appeal in his obnoxiously cringe LinkedIn style of marketing techniques is a line he rides; I do recognise this may be a that is generally my own, but I would say reading core texts yourself if far more fruitful than his works (which is a given).","upvotes":17,"created_utc":1675774144.0},{"author":"Staterae","text":"Some of the textual analysis was reasonable, (and definitely more a fan of Nietzsche than Aurelius), but it's arguable the author is over-emphasising the degree of passivity inherent to Stoic philosophy and drawing it to an unreasonable ***reductio ad absurdum*** that is closer to Zen Buddhism.","upvotes":13,"created_utc":1675786977.0},{"author":"frnzprf","text":"> You\u2019re a person who gets irritated by the smallest things, things outside your control like a person loudly crunching chips in the cinema. Accept everything about this situation, your own responses included.\n\nPersonally, I'm actually not that irritable. You could say I'm more \"stoic\" than people are kind of \"socially expected\". I don't know if \"socially expected\" is the right term. In movies, people are easier to affect than I am in reality, for dramaturgic reasons and I feel like other people try to emulate movie-behaviour.\n\nJust because you *can* talk yourself into being angry about something, doesn't mean that's your most natural and honest mental state towards it.\n\nI'm all for honesty towards yourself. That's what I like about Nietzsche. *Sometimes* being honest can mean that you *aren't* as emotionally affected as society expects you to.\n\nBeing honest towards yourself can sometimes be tricky. For example imagine a grandma who likes to bake cake and knit sweaters for her grandchildren. People might say to her that she should listen to her own desires and she might be tempted to invest less work in others to achieve that, but in truth the might be happiest when she actually makes other people happy.\n\nI'm not sure what Nietzsche meant by the slave-mentality. Does this grandma have a slave-mentality? I guess some people think on a surface level that they should endure and please others but a deeper, surpressed, level they know that they are sacrificing their own happiness. That doesn't apply to *all* altruistic people. You would expect humans to be evolved to be altruistic *to the extend it benefits your genes*.\n\nI also like these \"strangely satisfying\" Youtube videos, like where someone pops bubble wrap. You only get to feel satisfaction from these weird things if you are very honest to yourself, because society won't suggest it to you. Weird sexual fetishes are the same. People who aren't honest to themselves would rather eat at an expensive restaurant or visit a popular tourist destination, for example. (On the other hand society very much suggested to kids to buy fidget spinners and push pop, so it's not that clear cut either. The honest option is not necessarily the less obvious option and it's not necessarily the option that goes against social pressure.)\n\n------\n\nSometimes you can choose how you feel about something. For example when you watch a race and you don't know any of the competitors, you might choose to invest your \"heart\" into anyone arbitrarily and feel good when they win and bad if they loose. There is this other youtube channel where they [race marbles](https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=SKDJF3cB438). I guess it would be anti-stoic to feel emotions when watching a marble race. \n\nOn a darker side of that, I can choose to \"dehumanize\" people and then I don't feel empathy towards them anymore. I can \"dehumanize\" a spider when my sister asks me to kill it and I can \"humanize\" another spider in a terrarium that my friend asks to to care for, while they are on vacation.\n\nIn these cases you can't choose based on what is most honest.","upvotes":5,"created_utc":1675769803.0},{"author":"CaptSaveAHoe55","text":"Hey I mentioned Nietzche gib me updoot-this sub","upvotes":4,"created_utc":1675801355.0},{"author":"No-Jellyfish-876","text":"Nice try Hedonists \/s","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1675790644.0},{"author":"ddre54","text":"I just hope the author never reads The Bible","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1675804943.0},{"author":"PhotographTop6865","text":"I consider stoic philosophy as a tool something to use when u in need for it, not to leave by it, after all compressing emotions is unhealthy, and emotions is a part of human being so you can't leave without them","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1675768800.0},{"author":"mavaddat","text":"It was [Hegel who identified Stoicism as the slave philosophy](https:\/\/medium.com\/stoicism-philosophy-as-a-way-of-life\/hegel-on-stoicism-6d434fe3b4a4) in his *Ph\u00e4nomenologie des Geistes*.

It\u2019s quite possible that he considered practicing stoics as being rather detached. However, I don\u2019t read him as outright rebuking stoicism either.\n\nStoicism, at least the popular view of the Greek\/Roman version, is about keeping your shit together whenever you hit a bump in the road. In that way you can attain a more satisfying life by focusing on the things that really matter. In a nutshell, bad things happen, so accept it and move on. I know stoicism is more than this, but in the case of the blog being referenced, the author seems to be focusing on stoicism within modern daily life.\n\nI respect the author, Neil Durrant, and his position on this.

These verses stress the importance of leading a virtuous life, living in harmony with others, and seeking wisdom and understanding. They encourage individuals to strive for inner peace and to cultivate qualities such as wisdom, courage, and justice. The verses also emphasize the connection between the individual and the universe, and the importance of understanding one's place in the world.\n\nPythagoreanism places a strong emphasis on both the study of mathematics and the development of virtue and moral behavior. In Pythagoreanism, these two aspects of life are seen as interconnected and mutually reinforcing.The study of mathematics is seen as a means of achieving wisdom and understanding, which in turn helps individuals to lead a virtuous life. Pythagoreans believed that by contemplating mathematical relationships and the underlying order of the universe, individuals could gain a deeper understanding of the nature of reality and the divine. This understanding would help individuals to cultivate wisdom, courage, and justice, and to live in harmony with others and the universe.\n\nAt the same time, the development of virtue and moral behavior was seen as an essential component of the path to wisdom and understanding. Pythagoreans believed that leading a virtuous life was necessary for individuals to fully appreciate the mathematical relationships that they were studying. By living a virtuous life and practicing the principles of wisdom, courage, and justice, individuals could achieve inner peace and come closer to the divine.\n\nHow does Pythagoreanism's emphasis on mathematics relate to its broader philosophical and religious beliefs?\n\nIn Pythagoreanism, the study of mathematics and the development of virtue and moral behavior are seen as complementary aspects of a broader path to wisdom, understanding, and spiritual enlightenment. By balancing the pursuit of mathematical knowledge with the cultivation of virtue and moral behavior, individuals can gain a deeper understanding of the world and their place within it.","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1675832404.0}]},{"title":"The Aesthetic Appreciation of Ruins","author":"ADefiniteDescription","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9pQHAIHq2Ro","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.73,"created_utc":1675788335.0,"comments":[{"author":"gimboarretino","text":"Being Italian, I can assure you that, as beautiful as they are, living surrounded by temple ruins, half-destroyed colonnades, ancient palaces in decline, ruined churches, etc. has a very negative effect on people's mentality.  \nThere is a definite decrease in active energy, drive, ambition, and a tendency towards cynicism, acceptance, and thinking that the best is past and will not return.  \nI am convinced that a good part of the problems of a city like Rome stems from being - in part - an open-air museum of magnificent ruins.","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1675849740.0},{"author":"ADefiniteDescription","text":"**ABSTRACT**:\n\n> Philosophers Elizabeth Scarbrough (Florida International University | she\/they) and Brandon Polite (Knox College | he\/him) discuss Scarbrough's work on the aesthetics of ruins (links below). \n\n>We first consider what is involved in appreciating ruins.

Flow occurs when, e.g., an athlete or a musician (the two most obvious examples) is performing at a top level, but is not *explicitly* trying to do things; they just let the music or game 'flow' out of them. \n\nIt is characterized by a *lack of blood flow* to the pre-frontal cortex (PFC), which is why it's also known as \"transient hypofrontality\". That lack of blood flow is indicative of the body shifting resources to other parts of the brain. In this case, by shutting down executive and higher order functions in the cortex, the body is able to do things it knows how to do *without interference* from the judging, over-thinking PFC. \n\nEvery golfer knows this problem. You stand over the ball, and there are a million thoughts in your head. \"Don't shank it, don't slice it, keep your arm straight, keep your head down, make a full turn, don't come over the top, I wonder what's for dinner tonight, shift your weight, keep your heel down, don't hit it in the bunker,....\". Then you proceed to top it into to the bunker. \n\nBut you have made this shot a hundred times before, so why are you worrying? You don't worry about picking up a fork from a table, or walking two steps to the front door - you trust your body to do that. But in some tasks, we don't have enough trust to 'let go'.\n\nAs OP notes, one can't reach flow unless you have already mastered the basics of a task. That's why piano students spend hours on scales, and golfers hours on the range. You need to build up the synapses and autonomous skills so that you don't need the higher order brain functions to complete the task. \n\nOnce you've reached some level of expertise, flow is possible. It is not easy to 'trigger' it, though, because it's not easy to consciously make your conscious brain (CB) take a break. CB is always there, judging each action, assessing the situation, making predictions, and deciding what to do next. However, CB is too slow to play a complicated arpeggio, react to a 100-mph baseball, or make a 20-ft jump shot. We depend on our autonomous systems to do those things for us. \n\nAnother issue with flow is it's unsettling to an extent. After, you feel that it wasn't 'you' that did it - it was some other guy in your body, as 'you' weren't present, in that the CB wasn't doing its usual job of collecting, collating, and judging every act you do. Pro athletes have described it as 'being in the zone' - you're completely aware (of the game), and completely unaware (of your ego) at the same time. When they are finished, they don't have much memory of how they played, only that they played really well. \n\nMy 30th birthday, I got hammered, and I was playing in a golf tournament the next day. I woke up in the morning, probably still half-drunk, and went out to play. I'm normally a very chatty golfer, but this day, I was very quiet. Instead of the usual thousands of thoughts in my head, there was only \"hit it in the fairway\" and \"hit it on the green\". \n\nWhich I did. I shot 76, four over par, about ten shots better than I normally do, and I won the tourney. I only remember three shots from the round: two holes had giant oak trees in the centre of the fairway, and you were supposed to play to one side of them. I just decided to aim for tree - \"I'll never hit it\" - and proceeded to hit both trees on one bounce. I had no shot, so had to chip out sideways, costing me a stroke on each hole. The very last hole, I guess I was beginning to 'wake up', because I hit it over the green, and had to make a nice chip shot to get it close. That shot won the tournament for me. \n\nAfterwards, I barely remember anything except those three shots. Everything else is a bit of blank. Without the CB's constant presence, I was able to perform at my optimum skill level, but none of it registered either.","upvotes":81,"created_utc":1675693817.0},{"author":"anonsequitur","text":"I feel like a lot of people here are equating the concept of Wu Wei with the concept of \"The Zone\"\n\nWu Wei is different from the zone.

I just hope that whoever this is meant to reply to is going to take this seriously enough. I just have to say this. While it is one thing to say that God is dead with the idea of God not truly a real thing at all would be one thing, it's also another to say so while if it's true even though the idea is still a reality as well. I don't think this video at least as far as I know is means to suggest anything about God at all, so you don't have to worry that's not something that I am currently thinking about right now. But, it is true and very likely that on the other hand, not many people even know much about God to begin with, like how like all of what's being said in this video aside from whether God is an ultimate value made by humans or not, God is already dead, like if you came up to me on the street right now and said did you hear that God has died, the first thing I'd tell you right now is, I know, he was already dead. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \nI have a separate connection to God than other people do and so I know these things, the bible isn't the only reason for me saying so, even though it does say that in the bible actually. The thing that people should know, and I think should be something that applies to them not just the fact that I'm speaking about God right now happening to, is that just because God is meant to, \"live forever,\" doesn't actually mean that he isn't dead, if it's true that life and death is only a matter of perspective, then perhaps being dead is the only perspective needed to see what life is, life is not just defined as not being dead, it also means to be alive, and so, just because God could be dead, he is not like humans who have to live just to die, God is alive and does live and while being just as much dead as anyone else, because it's only a matter of perspective to him. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \nMy other thought on this would be this, it's not like there's any point in which speaking about it really. Because, there's not a very good reason to wonder if God had to be murdered in order for him to have died already, if he was the one that killed himself. Would that make a difference in whether someone could call God the ultimate value then you wonder? Probably not then anyway, because having that kind of power also means that you take on all the responsibility also, which also means he must be the one that knows all of the misfortunes of mankind, that's what it must mean to be one one with God in the first place, so knowing all the misfortunes of mankind is something that you'd have to ask yourself then, if you were one with God and you knew just what it was for being like just to be human, then if you decided to be the one that kills yourself while being God, that becomes the new ultimate value at least to you anyway, maybe it's something only you could grasp the concept of if you could be God on one hand, but then again, that's just it, that is only if you could come to the same decision as well, and if you were the only one to do so, being God or being only one with God, what's it matter then, it's still beyond the grasps of understanding for anyone else for that matter if you were the only one like humans to know all of human's misfortunes and actually still wanted to kill themselves, which is now the new ultimate value for all of human kind. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \nSo... You're not wrong, in assuming that maybe this guy made his analysis of God in the hopes of simply leaving up to multiple interpretations.. I just want to say however I don't want to ask someone else to simply think they have to believe anything that I have to say, but when I say my connection to God is different, that's because I am him, and yet nothing in this video is primarily something that I am saying right now is whatever I may happen to disagree with. No one ever believes the things I say about it, I'm not worried about that. I'm only worried about talking about this right now. I just to bring this up right now because of this, because if whether anything being said in that video is true, regardless, even however superficial, if the idea of God is being questioned, it then brings to the table the idea of the Devil as well also. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \nI know many things that people wouldn't about the idea of God being something that people could wrap their minds around in one way or another, but I also know a thing or two about just the Devil also. Something that I've just had to pick up over a very long time that I never found any reason to disagree with either. The Devil is primarily against the idea of existence itself. And I can't even imagine otherwise right now, I mean, like I've said I never disagreed that God could have been dead this whole entire time, and if God is already dead, then why does the Devil have a reason to keep existing? That's just his existence, is to be against all of existence that's why. But after spending so long thinking about it, the only thing I can say I think now is the only way to be against, for anything that not just exists but would happen to at all, to be against existence, is if existence itself was already against you to begin with. Like you said, to be away from God, is to be in touch with your own individuality or however you put it, or lack there of, so the only way to be truly away or against God being set to the ultimate value for humanity is to, A: kill yourself, or B: be the Devil, because if God did exist and did happen to be the one that killed himself, then there's no other correct conclusion to make then, was that if God is dead, then the Devil really is against existence, but unlike God who was the only one to shoulder the responsibility of all of humanity on his shoulders when he took his own life, existence would just happen to be the last thing that going to be the one to hold the Devil accountable for destroying all of existence then. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \nMy point is. The Devil hasn't actually destroyed all of existence yet, has he?... You can see the difference now between, what humans put onto being the value that's the image of God in their heads, what it means for there to actually be one real ultimate value regardless of if having to exist means having to call that thing God, and what it actually means for existence to be against oneself even if that oneself did happen to truly be the Devil or not. Maybe God being the ultimate value is more than just what goes beyond human understanding of being the ultimate value to have, maybe it's just that's the value that humans just aren't thinking being capable of grasping is that, that there is no more beyond than the really what just is the ultimate value of understanding, it doesn't mean that it doesn't exist, just that it's not something that humans have the capability of wrapping their minds around, the only thing they know is just how to call it is God and that's it. And don't twist what I said around, I meant just what I said. Because, they are humans, they already made it up in their minds it's like this, whether it's individuality or being against that which is against self individuality, calling God a transcendent entity depends on whether just their capability of comprehending its existence. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \nThat's about I think all that I had to say really. Except for this, that I'll tell tell you what made God and why he's already dead right now in one of the ways I know how. Have you heard of, \"the will of God?\" It turns out that's a real thing, it went like this, a will is written for when a person dies right, the will is what made God, and God is his own will, if God is the ultimate value like what's being said, then of course aside from the value that's been assigned to him, then being the ultimate and all, he has the capability to exist apart from it as well also, since he is everything that is and none are greater than him, that's why his will was created first, it was his will that created all that is, the only thing not included in his will, is himself, for he is the all that is and ever was and the ultimate, that which there could be no other mistaking who, \"existence\" or \"life\" had been given to, which then is what creates his will thus forth, it's his ability to say, (being the only being in existence that even is capable of being dead and still finding a way to still be alive at the same time) to say yes to existence. Whether what I was discussing above is true, or for that matter whether this right now simply happens to be true or not, that's the only way it is, is, because, he is the only one who can say so.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1675842586.0},{"author":"No-Chocolate483","text":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/cEOBCc5UcLI","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1675843273.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1676100625.0},{"author":"Alimbiquated","text":"You can tell god is dead because almost nobody says \"damn\" or \"hell\" when they bang their thumb with a hammer any more.

If it is satisfied, it soon gets replaced by boredom, and a new desire arises. The cycle begins again. There is no point at which we can count ourselves as fulfilled. ARPGs offer an excellent example of Schopenhauer's pessimism. In these games, the player searches for loot. She either gets it or does not.

This is a huge responsibility, yet we seem to be failing it. And the fate of future life may hinge on owning up to a simple belief set: That I live in one small corner of the world; my viewpoint, perceptions and beliefs are flawed by the boundaries that accompany my surroundings, and therefore I should strive to find what misbeliefs I have, where I am limited, in order to determine the best possible truths.\n\nAs humans, our viewpoints are inherently flawed despite our best intentions. I have come to this conclusion, particularly as an immigration lawyer, as an observer into the private lives of many people from around the world, the societies and governments, and religions that bind them. I came to this conclusion through my own endless struggles in life and work and travel, however relative they may be. I acknowledge that my perspective will always be inherently flawed. I must seek honesty, there, before ego.\n\nTo have an appropriate level of honesty, one that evens out toward objectivity despite the \"who\" who is doing the perception, is to be one with an extreme awareness that, at any given moment you could be on the other side, depending on your placement in the lottery of birth. Like waking up on the other side of the world in a strange land. This recognition means that everything you take for granted as truth is likely another person's fiction - comedy or tragedy. All things rest \/ have rested \/ will rest in the same state of existence some day. And death is, in all honesty, the only ultimate truth we know exists, and that we don't really know what happens after it.\n\nAnd we should be unashamed and humble to admit this part of our existence. Because the subjective perception that taints what divides us in this ultimate experience is simultaneously horrific yet beautiful; it's natural. Therefore your subjective view will always divine. It's biological. You can only be YOU, and simultaneously try to be whoever you are not. The views of others are thus the same as yours.\n\nSo you must ask yourself, are your beliefs on life, love, fairness and justice as ultimately honest as possible? Is your vision for a \"basic standard of life\" the only fair option? can you admit that everything you know and believe may be \"wrong,\" no matter how small that probability may be? Or at least that there are several ways to achieve the same solutions; and just because some problems are of bigger or smaller magnitudes to you than to others doesn't make them any lesser in objective fact? \n\nMaybe you are already grateful for your lucky strike at birthright, or maybe you are disgruntled with the default circumstances of your happening to be alive... maybe you are starving, or maybe you are born with a silver spoon in your mouth... or you lost that spoon, someone stole it, in the midst of war. \n\nMaybe you are more like \"most  guys.\" and you're just stuck, like everyone else, in the distorted reflection of your baloney pizza place. You could be eating pizza with sour cream cheese and sweet baloney on one side of the world, thinking it's the most awesome pizza out there, because it's the only kind you've ever had. You have never tasted a Chicago deep dish or New York slice, and because all you really know is that sour cream cheese sweet baloney pizza tastes so darn awesome, you conclude that your opinion reflects an ultimate truth. But, of course this is dishonest. We confuse truth with opinion because we forget about our own subjectivity, and that we adopt a shared subjectivity of those who surround us. So we have two missions: 1) root out Individual subjectivity in our community, in our world, and 2) root out the shared subjectivity around us. We, as groups and communities, adopt the same subjective beliefs to be ultimate truths. It helps us to survive in packs. But it also can form malice; a mob mentality; a binding rigidity against the creation of common good. Fake news, the scape goat, so to speak of today's subjective vices. The denial of individual or group subjectivity does not create a platform for trust, love, or standard of care to \"others.\"\n\nSubjectivity itself is not tantamount to dishonesty. But it's the denial of our own subjectivities that perpetuates the repeating conflicts of time. \n\nCould the ultimate intelligent life be one that inherently & concurrently sees the subjectivity of their own perceptions? Perhaps this means an enlightenment... Solid state. An inner peace that reflects among us, and guarantees us all the chance to sit with God. Nirvana.\n\nIn the meantime, as of now, most human beings recognize the world around us from the inevitable, single viewpoint. The devil whispers, it's the ONLY way. That's our nature... our instinct. But, really we EACH see things only one way, and each one differently. So which one is correct or true? Without each and every one of us, there is no \"we.\" And without \"we\" there is nothing, but only nihilism. \n\nYes math is math, language is language, but don't we use a variety of symbols to express it? To think dishonestly is,- and quite blindly so- to doubt the validity of any other sort of existence in the world. And yet it's our instinct and nature to think so. This drives the 'just-i-fiction\" of the aristocracy; class systems; casts; conquests; inherited entitlement. Therein these trends lies an automatic doubt cast on anyone or anything whose existence diverges from those common beliefs by those who hold wealth and power, on the optimal essence or state of things for \"them,\" not \"us.\"\n\nTo combat this phenomenon, the Best one can do in life, to be righteous unto one's god, to one's tribe, to be fair to one's neighbors, to live and to think in a way that truly compliments other human beings, the land, all life, and health; to execute what we mostly all claim as our common objective of public good; in other words, to create the maximum positive outcome of any kind for all people and living things, is to live your life honestly, to the extreme. \n\nWith \"extreme honesty\" maybe we will find balance; and begin to hear The Word. \n\nSo wake up now, it's 2020 (when I write this). Let's see clearly that we are all flawed and beautiful at once. We are all different but equal in one way; that our perceptions are ours alone, only by the grace or Mercy of God; the chance that we are born only with who we are, for better or worse, flawed. What all this means? that none of us should assume we are the only beholders of the truth. Do not surrender to the flaws of our single organism biology. Do not surrender to instinct. \n\nIf we do not change our perceptions we may as well live life eating sour cream cheese & baloney pizza; never caring to taste anything else... so let's change this trend, today. \n\nWhat's the baloney in your life, preventing you to look outside of yourself? this is where the inquiry will begin. And until we can all ask ourself this question, and give an ultimately honest answer in the mirror, is to deny that all beings share more in essence than we differ. Until this happens, we will be stinking of baloney breath. Each, and EVERY one of us. After we smell our own baloney we wake up; recognize that we're in the same boat; seeking common goals; fighting common obstacles; and then pushing them aside. \n\nMy baloney breath may always exist, but at least if we can smell it on ourselves, and do our best to call it out, we may get along a little better in the world. So to to find your own baloney breath, breathe into a mirror, then grab some Listerine to (temporarily) stop offending others. It will persist, as morning breath does, but stop ignoring it. Take time to brush it away. Awareness is everything. \n\nJan 2, 2020 11:35:07 PM","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1675720813.0},{"author":"madstorkshork83","text":"I'm salty that my recent post about bio-information integrity and aging was moderated as non-phosophical, that's pretty short-sighted in my opinion","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1676123969.0},{"author":"Saadiqfhs","text":"Can you want someone to fit into a box and believe in love?\n\nI look for people that fit my schedule, someone with the same work and social schedules, as well as life goals timelines.

This is essentially the ability to gain the profits of unjust action while still existing themselves within society. This is distinct from the power held by someone like Homelander or Superman, who could decide they just don't care whether they appear just or not because society is unable to impose consequences upon them. Homelander and Superman do not generally in and of themselves (in universe) have the power to appear just while being unjust\u2014Homelander requires the resources of Vought-American to do so, and Superman exists in a universe with many other superpowered entities who could \"tell on\" him if he tried to covertly do evil.","upvotes":111,"created_utc":1675544742.0},{"author":"RedditOfUnusualSize","text":"Well, it's a bit more nuanced in that case, because very technically, Glaucon is making an argument that he doesn't believe in, and as such, is trying to make the strongest possible version specifically to knock it down.\n\nAnd as such, the argument that he makes about justice posits justice as a function of a social contract. I agree not to hurt you, you agree not to hurt me, and we call this compromise \"justice\". Justice is simply an instrumental good, to be valued insofar as my skull doesn't react particularly well to hammer impacts, and anything that reduces the amount of times people swing at my head with a hammer is therefore a good thing. And it's in that transactional context that he notes that justice would have no value to someone that has a superpower like the Ring of Gyges: because the Ring of Gyges, making the ringbearer invisible, makes them functionally invulnerable to hammer strikes (because you can't hit what you can't see), the ringbearer has no compelling reason to adhere to the social contract and not swing his own hammer with abandon.\n\nFurther, Glaucon is supplemented by Adeimantus, who argues that not only is justice not valuable to humans, it's not valuable *to the gods.* The gods ask for sacrifices and value that. A just person, who adheres to the social contract, always runs the risk that they will not be able to make those sacrifices. They might not have the money. But the ringbearer can steal with abandon; why not do so if by doing so, they can earn favor with the gods?\n\nSo the real way around this is ultimately to attack what we might call the \"social contract\" conception of justice. It has to be something more, something that is valuable both in itself, and for its consequences, like health. Because if it is, then even someone who possesses the Ring of Gyges still gains the benefits of being a just person, just as they draw the benefits of being a healthy person regardless of their possession of the Ring.\n\nNot critiquing or nitpicking; your comparison of the Ring of Gyges was both spot-on, and very similar to how I learned Book II of *Republic* as well. Glaucon's argument anticipates social contract theory over a millennium before Hobbes formalized it. And if I'm being completely honest, I still think it's the most compelling argument against social contract theory: legitimacy of the social contract is derived by common consent, not justice. As we see in American history, fundamentally unjust social contracts, that explicitly enfranchise some and just-as-explicitly disenfranchise others can be consented to, and they don't topple over just because they are unjust. It took the American Civil War to beat America into a state where Americans only disenfranchise groups like POC or women through informal means and functional second-class citizenship; it didn't happen on its own just because it was unjust. So the question becomes: what is the value of justice in a world where injustice can be, and often is, rewarded? If the United States is fundamentally unjust, why should we care so long as our regime doesn't collapse?\n\nBut again, not a criticism.

If Superman follows the law, it is only because that law was modified in recognition of the new reality his activities forced upon human civilization. Meanwhile, it's fairly trivial to imagine a different version of *The Boys* where the corruption ran so deep that Homelander received *actual, legal immunity* for his activities.\n\nAgain, you might argue that that's the equivalent of a typo: we were never really talking about \"the law\" in the first place. I respectfully disagree. I think it's a very important part of the conversation, and I think the slip-up is nearly as important as the thing itself.\n\nSuperman certainly *cares* more about following the *spirit* of *some* laws.

While, in theory, each might prefer lazing around while the other works for them, they run the risk of dying. However, if one of them do die, the other not only still has to work to sustain themself, they spent resources in the fight, so they are in a worse situation than they started. Compare with both of them working together, where it might even be possible to gain resources at a higher rate than simply adding what each could accomplish alone. Ergo, cooperation is the best action to accomplish selfish self-preservation.\n\nBringing it back to these super powered individuals, they might have abilities beyond that of others, but they still need other people. The invisible individual still needs to, say, steal resources of others to stay alive. Compare to the superheroes, who can likely satisfy any physical need they have with minimal effort, but have other non-physical needs. I haven\u2019t watched the show Homelander is from, but I heard he wants society to like him, so he has a social\/psychological need for others.

To deny the individual variables is to deny unique individuality, thereby nullifying the need for the question - if all behave the same, there is no need to wonder. To include individual variables automatically renders the answer to the question \u2018no\u2019 and again there is no need to wonder.\n\n\u2018All people\u2019 cannot be quantified to a single behavioral absolute, and attempting to reduce behavior of all people to a simple yes or no without considerable variables is as easy as determining if all the infinite cats in all the infinite sealed boxes are alive or dead.

Morals do not exist as a constant, they are artificial and entirely variable.

Superman is ***mostly*** invulnerable. Ignoring magic for the moment, he's vulnerable to kryptonite. This mineral reduces him from god to human-level, and in many interpretations sub-human because he's in pain or just weakened. This is a major plotline in some of the stories, where individuals like Batman, Lex Luthor, or the American government put in place contingencies to stop him. And he often knows about these contingencies. He doesn't share the exact same vulnerabilities as humans, but he is vulnerable.\n\nBringing magic back into it, we also have to face the elephant in the room: Superman often deals with entities and threats that humanity has no power in dealing with. In this engagements he is much closer to sharing vulnerability, and thus justice even under the original terms of the thought experiment can return and shape his general behaviour.\n\nThis is also true for Spider-Man. He may be physically superhuman in many ways, but isn't invulnerable (so tough that he has to roll with punches or people break their hands if they punch him, and he still has to dodge bullets), he experiences hunger, thirst, grief and loss, public humiliation and ostracisation. If he turned around and decided to try and take over the United States he would fail. If the government didn't kill him through sheer firepower, another superhuman would stop him. Because he doesn't exist in a vacuum. He can't act with impunity or outside the bounds of justice because he doesn't exist as the sole beneficiary of superhumanity.\n\nHomelander is a very, very different case. Within the fiction of The Boys, he ***does*** exist as the effective sole beneficiary of superhumanity. There are other superhumans, yes, but Homelander exists on a tier above even their strongest, and he has no known weaknesses aside from his psychology (which isn't something that they can really use to stop him per se). The United States government isn't capable of stopping him. Humanity is vulnerable to him because they lack the means to kill him. He can act with impunity in ways that Superman and Spider-Man simply can't.\n\nAll of this is to say that the thought experiment may be valid, but it cannot be applied to superhumans simply in virtue of them being superhuman. They can have vulnerabilities that can be capitalised on to level the playing field, and they frequently exist within a super-society that regulates their behaviour (assuming regular society doesn't). Despite being able to breathe in space, Superman doesn't exist in a vacuum as the only superbeing. Spider-Man may be superhuman, but he's still just a guy who needs friends (both human and superhuman) and a job to survive.\n\nAbsolute power can corrupt absolutely, but that doesn't mean it *will*.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1675698302.0},{"author":"rainmace","text":"Your audio soundtrack is badly mixed with your poor vocals","upvotes":0,"created_utc":1675554629.0}]},{"title":"Why The Sunk Cost \u201cFallacy\u201d Is Not Always a Fallacy","author":"ADefiniteDescription","url":"https:\/\/quod.lib.umich.edu\/e\/ergo\/12405314.0006.040\/--sunk-cost-fallacy-is-not-a-fallacy?rgn=main;view=fulltext","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.56,"created_utc":1675613592.0,"comments":[{"author":null,"text":"[deleted]","upvotes":98,"created_utc":1675614142.0},{"author":"worm600","text":"Arguing that there are psychological reasons for people to choose to pursue sunken costs further is not the refutation of the economic argument the author seems to think.\n\nEconomically, the whole point of the fallacy is that it tricks people into doing uneconomic things for personal reasons.","upvotes":58,"created_utc":1675614822.0},{"author":"Provokateur","text":"An accurate title for this would be \"Sometimes people unfairly categorize things as sunk cost fallacies.\" But you can't publish a paper arguing \"sometimes some people make mistakes.\" It says nothing like the title, and this is one of those papers where I'm shocked it got published, especially because Ergo is a decent journal.\n\nThe problem is revealed early, where the author says we should talk about \"honoring sunk costs\" instead of a \"sunk cost fallacy.\" That redefinition totally changes the subject matter.

A more comprenensible layman-accessible tl;dr would be something like:\n\nLittlejohn asks \"Why should [the truth-first approach] be concerned with the relation between good reasons to believe and the reasons for which you believe?\" Meaning, that iI it is right for a person to believe a proposition if and only if that proposition is true, why do we care if we believe things _for the right reasons_?\n\nMoral worth is a concept distinct from acting morally. For example, if you want a gun, and steal one from a guy who later turns out to have been a serial killer, thereby preventing deaths, we don't consider that worthy of credit or praise. You did a good thing, by accident. You can even intend to do a good thing, and do a good thing, but still not be creditworthy. It is basically about counterfactuals - if things were otherwise, would you still have acted morally? The article examines how to come to a good definition in detail.\n\nIn much the same way, epistemic worth is an useful analogue of that. If you believe baseless rumors about someone drowning a kitten, which in this specific case happen to be correct, your belief is not epistemically worthy. Or if you believe an idea solely because it's popular, i.e. a majority of people believe it, and the majority happens to be correct - you also ended up being correct, but only accidentally. Or, and here I would very strongly disagree^(*) with the author, if you believe a probabilistic statement based on statistical evidence, e.g. that you didn't win the lottery, you're accidentally right, which is not epistemically worthy.\n\nMoral worthiness can be restricted\/specified to be worthiness \"in some respect\", because there are different things we value that can come in conflict, like fairness vs. harm reduction, but epistemic worthiness isn't (claims the author): \"There is only one respect in which it is right to believe a proposition, namely, that it is true, and only one respect in which it is not right to believe a proposition, namely, that it is not true.\"\n\nAnyway, the author claims that this idea answers Littlejohn's query - epistemic assessment consists of truth, which is \"outward-looking\", about the relationship between beliefs and the outside world, and epistemic worthiness, which is \"inward-looking\", about the relationship between beliefs and evidence. You are right to believe things when your belief is both 1. true and 2. epistemically worthy. Then the article continues with some discussion about what is and isn't knowledge, and notes that a concept of epistemic worth helps define moral worth. Again, for more details, read the full thing.\n\n*: Subjective probabilities can be _calibrated_, meaning that when you say \"there's 60% chance X is true\" you're right approximately 60% of the time, 90% right when you say 90%, and so on for other values, or not calibrated, and it's often higher or lower - and that's what's possibly worthy, whether your assessments of probability are well or badly calibrated. Judging the \"accidentalness\" of individual probabilistic statements\/beliefs is hard, but possible. When you predict a die will not roll a 6, you could have used reasoning that I think is epistemically worthy - it relies on the best available evidence, arrives to correct conclusions for correct reasons more often than not (which is the best possible performance), etc. You could also have used unworthy reasoning, like believing you're an unlucky person, and still be right or wrong based on chance, but only epistemically unworthy based on the reasoning itself.

When a person\u2019s belief is epistemically worthy, she not only believes rightly, but does so in a way that reflects well on her and in such a way that she is creditable for believing what is right. While the notion of epistemic worth is independently interesting, the main aim is to show that appealing to it provides a response to arguments against the view that truth is the fundamental norm for belief and, thereby, to arguments for the view that knowledge is the fundamental norm for belief.

We have the conventions of rights because we evolved to be conceptual beings with animal needs.  We are also social and political beings as a result of our evolutionary historicity and thus we relate with one another in a manner consistent with how these evolved predispositions are consistent with the tendency. The \"fitness\" of a convention of rights is mostly based in how rational they are (for the sake of justifying agreement), and how well the contribute to the survival of individuals\/the group. Put simply, all justified rights are ideally predicated in terms of how they promote the essential basis of our physical and metaphysical existence and the pluralism implied by moral equality  - Everything else is just wishful thinking (a.k.a limited justification) and\/or the arbitrary\/non-necessary imposition of such thoughts on the self-determination of others ( aka the imperfect elements within existing conventions).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nproperty rights are a convention born out of value production and retention. We live in the world producing things, we use money as a basis for value representation and exchange, and we are incentivized by the relationship we have with the various things which are produced - particularly food, shelter, heat and water (so we dont die). without property rights to reasonably insure that we have consistent access to these things, we probably wouldnt cooperate well as a species and many people would not survive.

My results are both discouraging and encouraging: Whilst I will argue that the claim \u2018There are moral truths\u2019 cannot be shown to be both moral and capable of demarcating relaxed realism from irrealism on the basis of a convincing semantic analysis that would be compatible with relaxed commitments, the moral interpretation of moral realism can be secured by modifying our understanding of what distinguishes relaxed realism from error-theoretic irrealism.

Even if it is religious, the a priori belief is that the deity exists and that one should do what the deity says.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith that in mind I will take an example of something which is generally regarded as highly immoral: rape.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere several categories:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA.

Indeed, the republicans who bring up their religion are often at the extreme fringes of their party, and on the left you have \u201cCatholics\u201d like Pelosi or Biden, where their religion is effectively a footnote or even a stumbling block in the face of their overall politico-cultural agenda.\n\nBut if you look at the US for what it is, a highly fragmented society forcefully fused together with late-stage corporate capitalism, then you see that not only do people remember their myths, they hold onto them viciously.\n\nPoor whites still have strict, and more often than not highly emotive, evangelicalism dominating their entire worldview. There are still Catholics, women and men, who believe at their core that the abortion debate is a hidden holocaust.

Pure reason, on the usual view, is an empty scaffold of formal identity which merely works in line with a principle of non-contradiction on content given to it from outside. But any reduction of reason to such formality is itself non-formal in character and can thus not be consistently made by reason itself. Therefore, any attempt to reject the philosophy of nature in favor of the mere philosophy of science cannot be founded on this reduction without falling into self-refutation. One cannot simply cure the urge to know through reason.\n\nAnother tendency has risen alongside this reduction of reason to mere formal identity. This is the attempt to treat philosophy as a positive science which presupposes both its object as well as its access to it. While the positive sciences find their virtue in this double conditioning as what enables them to initiate investigation, philosophy will always metaphilosophically question both its object and its method until it can fully account for both. Philosophy thus uniquely demands autonomy as opposed to heteronomy. The philosophy of nature cannot take the doubly conditioned character of the positive sciences.","upvotes":5,"created_utc":1675344524.0},{"author":"Hotchipliar","text":"Interesting","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1675550918.0}]},{"title":"\"Nishida's Thought\" by Ueda Shizuteru","author":"LengthinessClear6536","url":"http:\/\/id.nii.ac.jp\/1374\/00008571\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1675405026.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"How to be a sceptic | We have an ethical responsibility to adopt a sceptical attitude to everything from philosophy and science to economics and history in the pursuit of a good life for ourselves and others.","author":"IAI_Admin","url":"https:\/\/iai.tv\/video\/how-to-be-a-sceptic-massimo-pigliucci&utm_source=reddit&_auid=2020","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1675254511.0,"comments":[{"author":"BernardJOrtcutt","text":"Please keep in mind our first commenting rule:\n\n> **Read the Post Before You Reply**\n\n> Read\/listen\/watch the posted content, understand and identify the philosophical arguments given, and respond to these substantively.

So there is likely evolutionary benefits in being conscious to various degrees. And it makes sense: when there's a complicated life form, it's easier for it to make quick decicisions with a central hub that controls most of the functions instantaneously. If it just reacted with other systems unaware what others are doing, it could lead to contradictionary courses of action. \n\n&nbsp;Anyway, what the philosophical accounts of the ontological nature of consciousness rarely seem to address, is that it is something that has developed over time, concurrently with others, and in an environment that is partly social, partly hostile, and requires sometimes quick decicisions to be made in order to ensure survival. It is not a magical metaphysical quirk in the universe. \n\n&nbsp; So at last, regarding artificial consciousness: I can't escape the feeling that the framework for it to happen needs to have some of the same elements present that natural evolution of consciousness had: \n\n1) need for self-preservation, \n\n\n2) need to react to outside stimuli \n\n3) others\n\nList isn't probably exhaustive, but these are my thoughts and just wanted to put them somewhere.","upvotes":11,"created_utc":1675175749.0},{"author":"Olive2887","text":"It's nonsense I'm sorry.

By this I mean, can any particular theory be used to create a human adult level conscious machine. My bet is on the late Gerald Edelman's Extended Theory of Neuronal Group Selection. The lead group in robotics based on this theory is the Neurorobotics Lab at UC at Irvine.  Dr. Edelman distinguished between primary consciousness, which came first in evolution, and that humans share with other conscious animals, and higher order consciousness, which came to only humans with the acquisition of language.  A machine with primary consciousness will probably have to come first.\r  \n\r  \nWhat I find special about the TNGS is the Darwin series of automata created at the Neurosciences Institute by Dr. Edelman and his colleagues in the 1990's and 2000's.  These machines perform in the real world, not in a restricted simulated world, and display convincing physical behavior indicative of higher psychological functions necessary for consciousness, such as perceptual categorization, memory, and learning.  They are based on realistic models of the parts of the biological brain that the theory claims subserve these functions.  The extended TNGS allows for the emergence of consciousness based only on further evolutionary development of the brain areas responsible for these functions, in a parsimonious way.  No other research I've encountered is anywhere near as convincing.\r  \n\r  \n I post because on almost every video and article about the brain and consciousness that I encounter,  the attitude seems to be that we still know next to nothing about how the brain and consciousness work; that there's lots of data but no unifying theory.  I believe the extended TNGS  is that theory.  My motivation is to keep that theory in front of the public.  And obviously, I consider it the route to a truly conscious machine, primary and higher-order.\r  \n\r  \nMy advice to people who want to create a conscious machine is to seriously ground themselves in the extended TNGS and the Darwin automata first, and proceed from there, by applying to Jeff Krichmar's lab at UC Irvine, possibly.

Nobody cares that dead people aren't suffering (which, for the record not everybody even agrees with); rather, the point is you didn't get to go to your birthday party, or any of your other birthday parties, or any other thing you rather like. the author's argument is exactly as bad as a thief saying that, technically speaking, you don't have your money anymore and so shouldn't complain about it. The point is that you were alive, you did have opportunities, and now you don't. that's death, and that's why it sucks. as a comparison between what was, and what is, death is bad. as a comparison of what is, and what could be, death is bad.\n\nthe author excludes timelines where you have died from the analysis because, as they put it, you don't exist in those timelines. but that's precisely point. the timelines where you stop existing are tragic because non-existence doesn't let you do much. in timelines where you were alive, and then stopped doing being alive, you can really obviously see the rapid drop in value as long as you aren't forcefully making devil's advocate arguments. likewise, it's very easy to compare the timelines where you didn't die and are doing fun stuff to ones where you do and, like any rational human, pick the one where you're alive and kicking. the author puts in this pre-essay on how evolution has programmed us to prefer not to die, and that's why all these poor irrationals can't grasp his super good argument, when not wanting to die is just simple math around still wanting to do more stuff.\n\nnow, this is all to defend the deprivation account of death's badness based comparison between past and future states as well as different counterfactual states. but I'd like to also point out that a key part of the author's essay is, essentially, suicide advocacy. from this point, I'd like to say my piece, which is that the author is dangerously wrong and you should not kill yourself, and that their argument is far too narrow in focus to justify taking your own life. it m ore or less ignores the reality that half of death's harm is not to the individual, but to the individuals around that individual. even if you buy the author's argument (which you shouldn't, it's bad for really obvious reasons), suicide is still harm to everyone else you care about. take it from an internet person, do not let bigheaded internet people influence your life or death decisions, and if you are seriously considering suicide, please discuss it with a loved one or a counselor.","upvotes":36,"created_utc":1675095381.0},{"author":"thatswacyo","text":"This entire argument seems to depend on the idea that each individual person is an island, totally independent of other people or social groups.\n\nDeath isn't bad because it's bad for the person who died; it's bad because it's bad for the people who have lost a member of their social group to death.\n\nIt's almost like you're trying to argue that my hand getting chopped off wouldn't really be bad for my hand.

The basis of moral value is nature, and has to do with sustainability not preferences.\n\nI would put the entirety of psycholigical drives, suffering or pain or desire or pleasure into the exact same category as you put the fear of death: evolutionary guides to promote survival, that have no inherent value outside of that context. They're just natural phenomenon like friction or volcanos, and have just as little relation to ethics.\n\nI definitely am opposed to the intuition-affirming method of study of ethics that you point out though. Those intuitions are part of that same set of arbitrary psychological drives. Morality should be about uncovering values that exist in nature, and restructuring out behavior-algorithms to reflect these external motivations, and not about trying to rationalize arbitrary preexisting drives as being inherently valuable.\n\nI can't comment too much on the finer details cause I reject so many of the premises the argument is built on.\n\nHistory is written by the victors.

When referring to ethics, I am narrowly focusing on general society-wide ethics. While purely self interested egotistical systems exist, those are answering a fundamentally different question from what is ethical in the sense that we typically mean such. While I believe there is a solid defense for the deprivation account, I will instead declare such a defense unnecessary and explain why we can safely presume Preserving Life = Fundamental Good even if we take this argument entirely independent of such justification.\n-\n\nEthics are, first and foremost, a cooperative mechanism for humanity to work together. Rules are crafted and governed not necessarily for each individual person or good, but for how a society would be capable of functioning. Doctors not murdering one patient to harvest organs for five others, yada yada. Even if we presume an individual harm is being done to a suicidal person by trying to save them, the harms to society by taking the alternative route are greater. In a similar vein, the presupposition of Preserving Life = Natural Good is one we necessarily need, lest ethics fundamentally collapse. Individuals are interested in protecting their own lives, any ethical system that does not value this would fail to serve enough people. Ethics, as a self propagating memetic system of morality within the collective consciousness of humanity (or, more accurately, a quantum cloud of an ever fluxing number of ethical interpretations competing over the landscape of humanity\u2019s collective consciousness), needs this fundamental building block to persist.\n\nFurther, given it runs counter to innate instincts, any new people born would have to be indoctrinated. There needs to be heavy justification to compel people to adhere to or internalize ethical precepts, and I don\u2019t see sufficient justification. It wouldn\u2019t just need to prove itself better, but significantly better. The world sticks with qwerty keyboards despite it being suboptimal, as a mundane example. I would not be satisfied with \u2018well maybe we can\u2019t be super special sure death is in fact bad for us\u2019, I would need something harder, an \u2018I have active proof for why death isn\u2019t bad\u2019. As another example, we must presume basic things about reality to escape from solipsism.\n\nEven if such a system were adopted by the masses, too many other precepts would fall apart. Murder being bad. Murder becoming a viable solution to mundane problems. Damage done to living people from said deaths whenever they occur at the far increased rate such a society would produce, because no, there is no way that humans hardwired or otherwise to believe \u201cDeath Is Not Bad\u201d would not be far more willing to spread it around. Even if inside ivory towers there is a theoretical justification, ethics must be written, at least in part, for the lowest common denominator to follow. We couldn\u2019t just say \u201csnuffing out life is morally neutral\u201d and leave it at that, keeping the rest of the framework the same, we would have to rewrite all of ethics from the ground up.\n\nFinally, I will refute the idea that even if in practice the concept of \u201cDeath Is Not Bad\u201d fails, running it back one step would still make it work. Specifically, \u201cif we genocide all of humanity, it would be a category error to say humanity would be worse off\u201c. Not only would I presume the existence of ethics as a natural good for the purposes of human cooperation and for the memetic survival of any ethical system I adhere to, the extinction of humanity would fundamentally delete ethics from existence. It would be a category error to make any ethical statement about ethics at such a point, including calling specific statements a category error, because the concept of category error (and everything else) exists only while ethics itself persists.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1675135431.0},{"author":"ProDigit","text":"Well, Death doesn't concern us (as long as we're alive death isn't here, and when it is, we're no longer here).\n\nI think what scares people most, is the process of dying.

You start out with a lengthy discussion about the evolutionary origin of the fear of death. IMO, the best way to interpret this argument is to see it as being analogous to the evolutionary debunking argument from metaethics. There are different ways of spelling out the argument, but the basic idea is that we are unjustified in believing moral realism because our beliefs do not \"track the truth.\" Evolutionary forces would lead us to have intuitions that support moral realism *even if moral realism were false*. \n\nIn a similar vein, you argue that our belief that death is bad is unjustified because evolutionary forces would lead us to believe that death is bad for us even if it, in fact, is not. I actually think this is a pretty good argument, but what one must recognize is the *limited scope* of this argument. Evolutionary debunking arguments are powerful arguments against intuitionist epistemologies such as the one espoused by the philosopher Michael Huemer. One of the ways Huemer defends moral realism is by holding that our intuitions support the view that morality is a realm of objective fact. We, thus, have *prima facie* justification for accepting moral realism since we have, on Huemer's account, reasons to trust our intuitions in the absence of defeaters. \n\nEvolutionary debunking arguments are best understood as functioning as defeaters for realist intuitions. However, this means that evolutionary debunking arguments are not *rebutting defeaters;* rather, they are *undercutting defeaters.* They don't show that a belief is *false.* They undermine one's *justification* for their belief by demonstrating that one's intuition that said belief is true is, in fact, unreliable (they'd have the intuition that it's true regardless of whether it's actually true). However, I don't recall ever arguing that death is bad by directly appealing to the intuition that it's bad. Instead, I've defended the deprivation account indirectly. Just to give one example, I have appealed to what I shall call the \"symmetry argument for the badness of death\" (not to be confused with Lucretius's symmetry argument against the badness of death). I have argued that if death can't be bad for a person, then death can't be good for a person either, but since there are cases in which death can be good (e.g., terminal illness), we should reject the view that death can't be bad. Your evolutionary debunking argument, thus, does nothing to undermine the independent sources of justification I have appealed to in defending the thesis that death is bad.\n\nIt's also worth noting that you simply haven't done anything to respond to my symmetry argument. You just implicitly presuppose that there is an asymmetry without offering any sort of justification for this other than by appealing to your own idiosyncratic intuitions. Here are just a few examples of this:\n\n>those who are alive and whom have never experienced death, or directly observed what happens to a mind (if anything) after death are not qualified to pass judgement on the badness of death. \n\nIf I'm not qualified to make the judgment that death is against my self-interest because I have never experienced death, then you're not qualified to make the judgment that death is in your self-interest because you have never experienced death.\n\n>It\u2019s true that suicide precludes future happiness; however now that you are dead, you are no longer an entity that desires and needs happiness, and therefore you are no longer capable of regretting any choice that you have made that results in failing to obtain happiness.\n\nIf suicide is not against my self-interest because I won't be capable of regretting that choice, then suicide is not in your self-interest because you won't be capable of being glad you made that choice.\n\nYou often claims that your philosophy rests on the following asymmetry:\n\n>An existent person can lament the fact that they exist, but a non-existent person cannot lament the fact that they don\u2019t exist.\n\nBut this asymmetry is nothing more than a fa\u00e7ade. It only works if we accept a further asymmetry:\n\n>Something can be in my self-interest even if I don\u2019t experience it as good, but something can only be against my self-interest if I experience it as bad.\n\nAnd that\u2019s an asymmetry that I don\u2019t see any compelling reason to accept.\n\nLastly, I found your discussion of the timing problem wanting. You don't actually defend the timing argument against Timmerman's objections (believe it or not, I actually have some problems with his argument; I think we should just accept atemporalism), you instead just repeat the standard arguments you normally appeal to when defending your views on death (the experience argument and the existence argument). There are a lot of other problems that I had with your blog post, but I don't have the time or space to address each and every problem, so I'm just going to let you respond and hope the other issues come up.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1675226044.0},{"author":"pyrefiend","text":"> The Epicurean account of death\u2019s harmlessness is not broadly accepted within mainstream philosophy, which still takes our survival instinct at face value and contrives to manipulate language in ingenious ways in order to \u201caccount\u201d for the badness of death, but do so without making any kind of controversial metaphysical claims about what actually happens to our minds after death.\n\n> If our primal brain tells us that death is bad, then many philosophers will start out by enshrining this in their work as a firmly established conclusion, and then work backwards from that conclusion to try to arrive at an explanation of exactly why death is bad for us.\n\nThis is completely uncharitable. If you can't see any good justification for accepting deprivationism, you should err on the side of thinking that it's your fault, rather than the fault of deprivationists. Even if they are completely wrong, you still have much more to learn by taking their ideas seriously rather than dismissing them as delusions. Lack of charity is a serious impediments to learning--- if you think that people who disagree with you are all fools who can be dismissed out of hand, then you won't learn anything from them.\n\nEDIT: Okay, sorry, that was overly aggressive.

It read's like what a second year undergrad writes assuming they're the first person to ever call bullshit on the ideas they're being presented with (or not even realising that calling bullshit was part of the reason they'd been presented with those ideas in the first place). It's a very \"everyone else are just sheeple\" vibe.\n\nStarting off with the Plato section, it's talked about how Socrates seems to reply over-literally to Thrasymachus' claim regarding rulers, failing to understand the rhetorical point being illustrated. But Thrasymachus himself probably wasn't even real, or at least was heavily fictionalised by the dialogue - the whole thing itself is a rhetorical device! It's not that I suspect Plato was trying to make Socrates look like a bad thinking, it's that the whole dialogue itself is just an excuse to exposit ideas, not necessarily a realist account of two blokes arguing.\n\nAnd the end thesis has a gigantic gap in it as well. Philosophy is a field filled with people who love to argue, deep arguments, petty argument, pedantic arguments, broad arguments, and are generally well trained to pick apart each other's reasoning (and strongly incentivised too - bringing down a big philosophical theory is a great way to make a name for yourself). For a \"great\" philosopher's flawed work to survive in that environment, one of two things must be true. Its flaws must be either so subtle as to require another \"great\" philosopher to come around to unpick them, or the works must have value in spite of their obvious issues.\n\nThe issues picked up on in the article are, well, not new. Hell, the issues with the categorical imperative are so famous that anyone studying formal ethics will learn about it. These are very old observations. It's then reasonable to assume that, given how philosophers tend to bicker, dissect and scrutinise ideas, that these thinkers must hold some value in spite of their very well known flaws.\n\nThe article tries to sweep a whole lot under the rug by simply describing these thinkers ideas as \"interesting\", in a semi-contemptuous way. But most \"interesting\" ideas put forward by blowhards soon lose people's attention, and many philosophers considered important for a while fall into obscurity. The article doesn't really answer, why THESE thinkers, THESE ideas, in spite of all the scrutiny? Fun hypotheticals alone don't tend to secure people a place in the canon. It completely fails to tackle its own questions by just using the label \"interesting\" as though that explains anything. Most gradiose ideas with shit reasoning fall away - so in what different way are the \"great\" philosophers \"interesting\" that their ideas are kept around in spite of their known mistakes?\n\nMy issue is not that these thinkers are sacrosanct and shouldn't be questioned. It's that this article is so goddamned adolescent that it seems to assume the author is the first person to claim the emperor has no clothes, and doesn't seem to even think to pause and then check if that's true.","upvotes":54,"created_utc":1675174890.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":34,"created_utc":1675173508.0},{"author":null,"text":"Transform philosophy into mathematics.

I don't think anyone thinks that about the intellectual giants in *any* field.\n\nHowever, the examples Huemer picks on here aren't particularly good ones, and all of these deserve vastly more serious treatment than he gives them. Imagine deriding Kant's ethical theory, much less the entirety of Kant's work, based on one formulation of the categorical imperative and one quote from the *Groundwork*! Imagine critiquing Hume's \"bundle of perceptions\" theory of the self, without noting how it set the stage for Kant's unity of apperception.\n\nThat last example is significant, because where this article is absurdly incorrect is in further saying these were bad philosophers, bad thinkers, or that their \"greatness\" is entirely due to the provocative nature of their ideas.

No philosopher's system will ever be bulletproof, because philosophy is not just logic, but literature, and therefore depends on the fallibility and inexactness of language. The 'greatest' philosophers are those who 'won' the contest for celebrity, but the winning in these cases is more like 'winning' a political campaign than 'winning' a 100m dash \u2014 that is, not so straightforward, and involving lots of cultural factors.

It would be wrong for the government to pursue action against a citizen only acting in the bounds that the government defined for them, which in the case of FSE, are meant to be nonexistent. But I think this ignores historical precedent that, while governments set the laws and bounds of citizens and institutions, it is *citizens* that enact the will of governments, that follow their bounds in attempt to enforce the order that\u2019s been set out and idealized.\n\nOne of the most effective mental tools for a totalitarian government is the projection of (or maintaining an illusion of) unity and conformity. That all people are united in the aims of the government, all people are united in a singular, universal goal. But we know that it\u2019s because this image is artificial, enforced by means acting against the will of the public, such as secret police looking for \u201cdissenters\u201d, state propaganda, and political purging. This is the popular idea of what free speech repression looks like, that the government itself will extend itself to all aspects of the state to enforce its will.\n\nHowever, in the age of the internet, a variation of this illusion arises: when it *appears* that people are trusting of an institution arises, then people will rush to defend that institution of their own volition, which only strengthens the illusory legitimacy of that institution regardless of the institution\u2019s aims to oppress.\n\nThis kind of free speech repression exists in light of the rise of the far-right and anti-democratic attitudes across the world. With the amount of information that people are able to access, people already act with distrust of their current governments and institutions. When a demagogue comes to get support for political ambition, they will tap into that area of mistrust amongst the citizens to their advantage. And when they succeed, they continue attacking the government and institutions to enforce their ideas of how their citizens should be, which in part leads to free speech repression. \n\nThis was most apparent during the Trump administration. Trump, who lost the popular vote, still won the White House in part due to an inflamed political base clashing with a politically apathetic populace. And despite his deep unpopularity with all aspects of the public (including his own party and allies), aspects of the general public still enforced the aims of his administration. This includes news corporations (FOX, OANN (which was started in part by his administration), Breitbart, etc.)) which explicitly supported his campaign and presidency. It should be telling that the heads of these far-right news corps (such as Bannon) served on his administration in some way. And with the inflammatory rhetoric that the admin spread came targeted violence; not instigated by agents of the government, but by parts of the public that were deeply invested in that same rhetoric. It\u2019s no coincidence that a rise in violence against Asian-Americans came about due to hostile rhetoric about COVID-19 spread by none other than Trump himself (the \u201ckung-flu\u201d tweet).\n\nIn these cases, it is all but apparent that we all must be wary of the kinds of speech we adopt.

Milton Friedman summed up it nicely: \"Society runs on individuals pursuing their separate interests.\" It is upon this paradigm that we judge how right or wrong an action is.\n\nNow, in order for individuals to be able to pursue their separate interests, we must collectively agree to attribute meaning to things that otherwise do not have inherent meaning. Take the colors green, yellow, and red. In themselves, they mean nothing. We assign them meanings when they are lights on the road. Green means go, yellow means slow down, red means stop. If you drive, you agree to accept these meanings. But again, there is nothing inherent to these colors that would make them mean that. We could have just as easily chosen any other color. But we collectively agree on these three.\n\nWithout these conventions, there would be chaos on the roads. There are millions of car accidents every year, and that is with all of our rules in place. Imagine if there were none! Why is this bad? Because I could not meet my goals and you could not meet yours. And if, based on our paradigm, we want to maximize individual freedom, we must collectively agree on mutually beneficial rules. These rules that we agree upon are what we call morality.\n\nTherefore, what is moral wholly depends on how one defines society and what is most beneficial for society. In Friedman's definition, an individual pursuing his own interest is the foundation of society, and so what is moral is that which allows individuals the most freedom. But other societies may be built on different definitions of society, and have different ideas of what is beneficial for it. If this is the case, then what is moral must necessarily change.\n\nSuppose we see a society that rounds up Jews and exterminates them. If we say that it is wrong, what we're really saying is that it does not conform to our societal norms. Before we could say that that society should not be doing that, we must first prove that that society should operate the same way as ours. And even before we do that, we must prove that there is any reason whatsoever that all societies should function in the same way.\n\nBut why should all societies operate the same way, when there is nothing inherently good about any society? We call things good insofar as they align with our collectively agreed upon paradigm. But if they have a different paradigm, then there is no way to argue which is better, just as there is no way to argue that green inherently means go.\n\nWe could attempt to argue that their society would be better if they did not exterminate Jews, but by \"better\" we would only mean it would more closely mirror ours. But again, there is no way to prove that our societal norms should supersede theirs. In order to show that our societal paradigm is better, there must be a higher law to which all men are accountable, and we could judge each society's norms based on that. But if there is no God, no such higher law exists, and thus there is no basis upon which we can say one society is better than another.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1675435968.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1675493775.0},{"author":"0omincemeato0","text":"I wonder if people often take the definition of words for granted, and also to what extent philosophy is or has historically been responsible for giving meaning to words.

Federici engages with Shakespeare, Marx, & Michel Foucault.  \nFederici uses Shakespeare to explain the ideas and feelings of the upper class during this period.  \nFederici agrees with Foucault that history is not a foregone conclusion. Capitalism was not the only alternative to feudalism & the reason capitalism ultimately succeeded was because of the material conditions and the ideas of mercantilism.  \nFederici departs from Marx in greatly expanding our understanding of primitive accumulation. She argues the following points:  \nI. The expropriation of European workers from their means of subsistence, and the enslavement of Native Americans & Africans to the mines & plantations of the \u2018New World,\u2019 were not the only means by which a world proletariat was formed and \u2018accumulated.\u2019  \nII. This process required the transformation of the body into a work-machine, and the subjugation of women to the reproduction of the work-force. Most of all, it required the destruction of the power of women which, in Europe as in America, was achieved through the extermination of \u2018witches.\u2019  \nIII. Primitive Accumulation, then, was not simply an accumulation and concentration of exploitable workers and capital. It was also an accumulation of differences and divisions within the working class, whereby hierarchies built upon gender, as well as \u2018race\u2019 and age. Became constitutive of class rule and the formation of the modern proletariat.  \nIV. We cannot, therefore, identify capitalist accumulation with the liberation of the worker, female or male as many Marxists have done, or see the advent of capitalism as a moment of historical progress. On the contrary, capitalism has created more brutal and insidious forms of enslavement, as it has planted into the body of the proletariat deep divisions that have served to intensify and conceal exploitation. It is in great part because of these imposed divisions\u2014especially those between women & men\u2014that capitalist accumulation continues to devastate life in every corner of the planet.\n\nFurthermore, we look at the enclosure and privatization of the commons, and it\u2019s philosophical connections to John Locke\u2019s theory of property. Locke believed that proper use of the land was a moral imperative from God. Any land that wasn\u2019t being properly cultivated was deemed wasteland property, and any person could lay claim to that land even when other people were living on it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, we analyze the patriarchy of wage-labor. The collapse of feudalism opened up markets and created a production-for-market economy. Wage-labor divided production from the reproduction of the species, and devalued reproductive labor. Without a doubt, normalization of wage-labor was guided by the patriarchy; Sister Federici goes to great pains to write the history of the Patriarchy of wage-labor, a history which has long been forgotten or erased by even Warlocks like Marx. This devaluation created a more prominent sexual division of labor. It led to the creation by the 19th century of the full-time housewife and redefined women\u2019s relationship to men. So, women went through double degradation in the transition to Capitalism compared to men.","upvotes":0,"created_utc":1675011481.0}]},{"title":"Cosmic nihilism, existential joy | Human consciousness, and our need for meaning in a meaningless world, is the source of both tragic pessimism and the intense joy we take in life.","author":"IAI_Admin","url":"https:\/\/iai.tv\/articles\/human-consciousness-a-tragic-misstep-auid-2352&utm_source=reddit&_auid=2020","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1674825375.0,"comments":[{"author":"BernardJOrtcutt","text":"Please keep in mind our first commenting rule:\n\n> **Read the Post Before You Reply**\n\n> Read\/listen\/watch the posted content, understand and identify the philosophical arguments given, and respond to these substantively.

But I was never an agent with free will. Indeed, it is very freeing to accept the fact that you have no freedom to choose your actions.

First, I will show that some paraconsistent logicians employ an empirical methodology in arguing for the paraconsistent nature of logic. Second, I will present a view of normativity that is compatible with an empirical methodology.

Once she was away for a weekend seeing her family and she told him he had to stay home the whole weekend to look after their cat (even though they had two other housemates who were perfectly capable of feeding it)\u2026 she would chastise him for every tiny little thing (like arriving home to an un-vacuumed floor or an un wiped bench). She also frequently threatened to leave him over tiny arguments she started out of thin air over complete non issues and would disappear to random people\u2019s houses for the weekend without telling him (many occasions it was another guys house), then she\u2019d just roll back home and act like nothing ever happened\u2026 typical manipulative behaviour. I saw his confidence slowly deteriorating over time, I also saw him constantly stressed over the perpetual arguments she started and refused to resolve.\n\nI was torn between letting it play out or intervening. I spent a long time deliberating on whether I should leave him to make his decisions or just tell him straight out to end it and move on (also by the time I knew what was happening, he\u2019d already dug himself in quite deep and separating would\u2019ve been very hard for him so I really just didn\u2019t know was was the best way to provide support as a friend honestly, she also convinced him that it was bad faith to tell other people about relationship issues so he was often scared and reluctant to confide in anyone from fear that she would find out he was telling other people about their relationship issues). In the end I decided I wasn\u2019t going to intervene until I saw really serious and obvious life changing problems occurring. \n\nIt even went so far that she convinced him to buy a home in her home town and have the sale managed by her father who was a real estate agent. It was a terrible investment, and due to her propensity for manipulative\/controlling behaviour I was pretty certain she did it so he would be more attached to her, given her dad who was the real estate agent managing the sale and rental tenants too. The house wasn\u2019t even in the same state as him. Neither of them had plans to live there, the plan was to rent it out and pay the mortgage from the rent income, but they were sinking money renting in the state they were actually living in, so I don\u2019t see how any costs were being offset with this plan\u2026 anyway it was just dumb. \n\nAll of her behaviour from the outside looking in it was quite obvious she was putting him in scenarios which made it very hard for him to leave her if things turned sour\u2026 she had a bad fear of abandonment, every one of her friends believed she had bpd (apparently she was diagnosed as a kid and it seemed she refused to acknowledge it, to me it looked like text book bpd\u2026 fear of abandonment, manipulating loved ones into situations where they can\u2019t leave etc\u2026 so I was pretty certain this was the case). \n\nThe first time he confided in me about their arguments I could see exactly where their relationship was likely headed. My instinct was to tell him he should get the hell out of it before things turned worse, however I chose not to because I felt it was a situation which he needed to learn from himself, and it\u2019s just not my place to tell him how he should be managing his personal relationships and investments. I decided to let it play out so he could see for himself where it would lead because he needed that learning experience for himself. If I just took the liberty of making decisions for him, I\u2019d be robbing him of the chance to learn from experience which would not result in any personal growth for him\u2026 and also there\u2019s an infantilising element too, because I\u2019m not his dad, he\u2019s not a child either, there\u2019s just so many reasons why I shouldn\u2019t have got involved in his decision making. I\u2019ve come to realise there\u2019s a good reason why society believes it\u2019s rude to ask questions about another\u2019s financial and relationship situations.\n\nAnyway, the relationship inevitably blew up and as it crumbled I only gave him my opinions only in a descriptive way to help him make sense of it and come to his own conclusions so he could make his own decision instead of giving him advice in a prescriptive way. I felt it was better to just be there for support and perspective because it\u2019s his life and he needs to learn these lessons on his own. \n\nThere was also the worry that he could think I was trying to sabotage his relationship if he didn\u2019t believe my opinion. It was obvious he couldn\u2019t see what was going on, so there was a high chance he wouldn\u2019t believe me. There was also the chance that my judgement was incorrect too, because I don\u2019t know the entire story first hand\u2026 so who am I to just jump in and tell him what\u2019s what?\n\nGiving friends advice is very tricky and we can\u2019t take the same approach in every situation. If a friend has a habit of highly reckless driving for instance, it would be much better to tell them straight away to stop because their lesson could result in death or serious injury, it could also result in injuries for other people. There\u2019s no one size fits all rulebook for giving advice to friends, and I think it takes a lot of deliberation when it comes to our decisions in these scenarios. \n\nI think in a most situations (especially financial or relationship related), it\u2019s best to stay out of it unless the friend specifically comes to you asking for direct advice. It\u2019s also important to be wary of giving descriptive vs prescriptive advice too when they seek advice. I think overall, unless the decision can result in serious life\/death ramifications I think it\u2019s best to leave it up to the other person. People can only grow if they go out and learn directly from experience\u2026 when we intervene we rob them of that opportunity to learn and gain wisdom.\n\nEdit: grammar","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1674933989.0},{"author":"JomadoSumabi","text":"Including VACCINES!\n\nMind your business","upvotes":-2,"created_utc":1674824523.0}]},{"title":"\u201cAnybody can become angry, that is easy; but to be angry with the right person, and to the right degree, and at the right time, for the right purpose... that is not within everybody\u2019s power and is not easy.\u201d | The \u2018Golden Mean\u2019: Aristotle\u2019s Guide to Living Excellently","author":"philosophybreak","url":"https:\/\/philosophybreak.com\/articles\/the-golden-mean-aristotle-guide-to-living-excellently\/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1674640226.0,"comments":[{"author":"BernardJOrtcutt","text":"Please keep in mind our first commenting rule:\n\n> **Read the Post Before You Reply**\n\n> Read\/listen\/watch the posted content, understand and identify the philosophical arguments given, and respond to these substantively.

But soon their spikes hurt the other. So they separate again. But then the cold forces them back together, and of course they end up hurting each other again.  \n\n\n  \nSo the hedgehogs ultimately find an equilibrium: far enough to not be hurt by spikes, close enough to be somewhat warm. A compromise that leaves them unsatisfied, but it\u2019s better than nothing.  \n\n\n  \nSchopenhauer argues that it\u2019s better to be alone, to be your own source of warmth. While also realising that such is not possible for the vast majority of people: humans are social animals. So he advises us to \u2018keep our distance\u2019 (he even uses the English expression.)   \n\n\n  \nThe video goes a step further by thinking about a possible Nietzschean perspective: seeking intimacy and friendship, knowing full well that hurt might result.   \nWe can view the hedgehog\u2019s dilemma as something more than a simple metaphor for human relationships. It\u2019s a litmus test on how a person views life: full of suffering yes, but does that mean we should run from it, or embrace it?

Chs 1 & 2 - my commentary, notes and reflections**\n\n**Aristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics Book IV - notes**\n\n**Chapters 1 and 2 - On Generosity and Magnificence**\n\nWe humans are animals of community. From our hands to those of another it was with the giving and receiving of goods that we strengthened our bonds within our community and the foundations of the community entire. As we gathered to form villages and our villages grew into cities, so did the exchange of goods become systematised and grow proportionally more complex and dynamic.\n\nMoney was not merely a practical invention, it was a necessity. To name just a few of the reasons why money was necessary, we invented money (i) to avoid having to keep track of tables of complex ever-changing equivalences (e.g. 4 bushels of wheat = 2 pounds of butter = 1 ingot of iron), (ii) to enlarge the scope of trading itself by increasing the range of goods one person could buy as well as the range of people one could sell to, (iii) to enable a person to sell the perishable goods of one season with a view to buying those harvested later in the year. Money was a boon for every community and readily embraced as an institution. Money was made to serve us.\n\nYet today, more than any other point in our history, we live to serve money. Once upon a time we transacted to gain the goods we needed. Today the purpose of most transactions is to make more money. Spread across the histories of different people we will find celebrated instances of industrious chieftains, leaders and mayors who gathered goods and money to safeguard the growth and wellbeing of their community. Now we celebrate business oriented individuals who know how to organise humans into companies and corporations, i.e. communities whose purpose is to safeguard the growth and wellbeing of such and such a business person\u2019s money accounts.\n\nThe means have become the ends. The ends have become the means. We entertain the fantasy that humans are higher than other animals. Have we considered that we have perhaps fallen lower than other animals? There are parents in the USA - out of all countries - who work multiple jobs to afford rent and utilities. Woodpeckers dig a hole in a tree and get their housing rent-free\u2026 and what exactly is the difference in labour conditions between a child cobalt miner in the Congo, a Foxconn factory worker in China and a battery caged chicken? Chicken in battery cages are animals we reduced to our own image. Afterall, we let ourselves be managed as resources by the human resources department when we could have been managing money resources as participants of the department of communal wellbeing.\n\nWhat has gone wrong? Well, had humanity been a great tree, then money would have been the dead shadow that this tree cast. Stop looking at the shadow and its trinkets with such wonder and take more time looking at the tree, i.e. looking at each other. That is where life is. There is where wonder resides and dreams first hatch. Learn to engage with other people and spark fire in their eyes. Learn to relate with others, to form genuine friendships, to empower your fellow human beings and you will find greater things than the yachts and Lamborghinis the media puts before you. That is what health magazines imply when they print tepid headlines like \u201cstudies show that stable relationships decrease health risk\u201d. Human nature is when individual humans come together to form friendships and households and communities. The greatest life we can live is one spent as members of a community based on friendship and mutual trust. That is truly something! This we can call luxury. All these shiny objects they try to sell us\u2026 are the food of vultures!\n\nAristotle lived in a world much crueller than our own. There were no human rights nor any other guarantees of security that we get to enjoy today. Yet, the world in which Aristotle lived was much more politically dynamic and community oriented than our own. \u0399t is under such conditions that he and other greats of his age saw (i) those engaged with their community as more valuable and worthy than the \u201c\u03b9\u03b4\u03b9\u03ce\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u201d - idiotai -, i.e. the private individuals and (ii) money as a means for the empowerment of the community, not its end. Aristotle neither glorified money nor dismissed it. He put it in its proper place.\n\n**Chapter 1 - On Generosity**\n\n**(a)** **Introduction - the scope of generosity:** In the second book of the Nicomachean Ethics, we learned that a virtue of character is a particular attitude or disposition which a virtuous person holds towards something. In the third book, Aristotle first emphasised that virtue involves both how we choose to think and how we choose to act under variable circumstances. We then came to understand that courage is a disposition towards fear and that moderation a disposition towards pleasure.\n\n***What is then the scope of generosity?*** Well, generosity is the virtuous disposition towards the giving and taking of wealth. \u201cEspecially the giving part\u201d Aristotle underlines then explains that by wealth he specifically means \u201call the things whose value is measured by money.\u201d\n\n(**b) Generosity as a mean between two extremes:** For our sake and so that we can more easily conceptualise what a virtue is and comprehend why we should aim to acquire it, Aristotle provides us with a metaphorical schema based on proportions. Here we refer to the schema of the virtuous mean between the extremes of excess and deficiency.\n\nTo illustrate, let us say we have company and we want to prepare coffee for everyone. The optimal way to go about this is (i) neither to prepare too little coffee for there will not be enough for everyone, (ii) nor too much coffee for whatever remains will go bad and be wasted. Instead what we want is (iii) to prepare just enough coffee so that everyone gets their share and none of it goes to waste. To achieve this we take our experiences with coffee making into account and roughly calculate beforehand how much to make. We might miss the mark a few times in the beginning but with enough practice we will get the hang of it.\n\n***How does generosity fit in Aristotle\u2019s schema?***  So far we have learned that generosity is the virtuous disposition towards the giving and taking of money. Aristotle places generosity as the virtuous mean between miserliness and extravagance. Miserliness points to deficiency in giving money and is often paired with an aptness for taking it. Extravagance, on the other hand, stands for such an excess in the proportion of the giving that it either leads to the financial ruin of the giver or compromises the way such a person takes.\n\n(**c) Generosity as opposed to extravagance and miserliness:** We first defined the scope of generosity as a disposition towards the giving and taking of money. We then placed it within the framework of the mean and extrapolated extravagance and miserliness as two dispositions opposed both to generosity and to each other within the same scope. To gain a higher definition understanding of each disposition, and especially generosity, we will now look at them side by side and in more detail.\n\n**(i) Generosity:** Aristotle, first and foremost, defines the generous as those who know how to give \u201cthe right amount of money to the right people at the right time\u201d and who are disposed to do that \u201cwith pleasure, or at least without pain.\u201d\n\nSuch a definition precludes blind or random charity. It points to a systematised approach to sharing and to those generous as possessing certain experience and knowledge in benefiting others. We may say that generous people subscribe to a clear and practical vision of what good they want to achieve and what it takes to achieve it. This also implies that they actively partake in communal matters and have intimate knowledge of the various problems and challenges that arise both in particular cases and in the community overall. To provide just a few examples, a person may instantiate their generosity through contributions towards (i) merit-based scholarships for young people who are driven and have potential but lack means, (ii) the building or repair of communal amenities such as roads and waterworks, or (iii) the relief of those who met unforeseen disaster. (e.g. war, floods, fires e.t.c)\n\nWe understand, of course, that for someone to be in a position to give away money, they must have a measure of wealth in the first place. To this effect, Aristotle underlines that a generous person is cautious not to compromise their own wellbeing by giving beyond what they can afford. With that said, they do not feel any inclination to engage in sordid dealings of any kind, however profitable, for the ultimate object of their desire and attention is not money but the welfare of their community.\n\n**(ii) Extravagance:** The extravagant are disposed to live beyond their means. Aristotle explains further that they maintain neither a proper measure to their spending nor a proper approach. With this criteria in mind, we may call someone extravagant in any number of cases. In particular, we may call extravagant those who:\n\n* naively engage in haphazard money arrangements (e.g. \u201choney, I just took all our savings and invested it in a Kazakhstani tupperware start-up.\u201d)\n* let some form of addiction get the better of them financially (e.g. \u201cBill blew his inheritance on gambling and drugs.\u201d)\n* conjure a spectacle of luxuriousness they cannot afford (e.g. \u201cHello grandma! Yeah, it\u2019s Tim. I need you to lend me money so I can cover my monthly Tesla payment.\u201d)\n* waste money on various species of lackeys, flatterers and pleasers (e.g. \u201cBen gifted a brand new luxury car to an escort.\u201d\n* some combination of the above\n\nNo matter how extravagant someone is or in what way, Aristotle states that we can still help them improve their ways if they are willing to listen. In absence of that, however, and provided the circumstances appear, such a person might compromise their character further by engaging in sordid dealings to prop up their spending habits.\n\n**(iii) Miserliness:** Money is a miser\u2019s god and hoarding it the noblest possible activity. We typically perceive such people as crooks and more often than not they are exactly crooks. For we call misers either (i) those who go to great lengths to not give away one penny when their immediate personal gain is not concerned, or (ii) those who greedily take every cent they can without considering the wellbeing of others, the source of the money, their own reputation.\n\nMisers venerate money and hold it as an object worthy of love and admiration. They think money has value in itself. They are somehow blind to the fact that money gains its value only insofar as a community willingly holds it as a standard of exchange of goods and services. In today\u2019s terms, we may characterise such a person as a money fetishist. Their mind is only occupied with matters of money. Their view of the world is so twisted that they think that money makes the world go around.\n\nThey remind of a farmer who found a fruit bearing tree and eagerly gathered the fruit in sacks for himself but never bothered to water the tree, to fertilise it, to prune it, to protect it from disease. The next year he returned to gather more fruit, yet he bitterly noted that the harvest was small and did not taste good. He started shouting at the tree that it was \u201clazy\u201d and should \u201cpull itself up by its bootstraps.\u201d\n\nAristotle states that the miser misses the mark of virtue by a far greater distance than the extravagant man. Misers are thus more greatly opposed to those generous than the extravagant.\n\n**Chapter 2 - On Magnificence**\n\n(**a) The scope of magnificence:** Aristotle moves on to magnificence. Both generosity and magnificence are character dispositions towards wealth. To this extent, the two virtues are related. They do not exactly map onto each other, however. Given that we have a fair grasp of what generosity is, let us learn more about magnificence by figuring out in which manner it is distinct to generosity.\n\n***How is magnificence distinct to generosity?*** Generosity concerns itself with how people give and take money in general and regardless of the sums involved. Magnificence specifically considers the manner people of great wealth sponsor their community. We may talk of how they provide for its defence or fund its religious functions and events. We deal here only with large sums. To put this in other words, a magnificent person is definitely generous but a generous person can only be magnificent if they also possess great wealth.\n\nWe note here that the ancient Greeks held the belief that only the wealthy could afford to venerate the gods and sacrifice to them, at least on behalf of a city. In this way, all wealthy men were expected to task themselves with the funding and organisation of all the religious ceremonies and events which took place each year. Among such events we count athletic competitions such as the Olympic Games or dramatic festivals such as the Dionysia where the famous playwrights Aeschylus, Sophocles, Eurypides competed against others. This is the historical and cultural context in which Aristotle participates and from which he derives magnificence as a virtue.\n\n***What is then the scope of magnificence?*** Magnificence is the virtuous disposition wealthy persons may demonstrate when they contribute towards the public good, i.e. act as patrons of their community. As patrons they may e.g. sponsor religious events and ceremonies, fund the building and maintenance of city infrastructure, help with the organisation of the military, among other things.\n\n(**b) Magnificence as the mean between two extremes:** So far, we have reached an understanding of the scope of magnificence. To do this, we first compared it to generosity and then considered the cultural and historical background from which magnificence proceeds.\n\nTo further refine our grasp of this concept, we now consider its position on Aristotle\u2019s schema of the virtuous mean, identify the dispositions which stand for excess and deficiency, and place all three dispositions side by side to discuss them.\n\n***How does magnificence fit in Aristotle\u2019s schema?*** Magnificence is the mean. It is the virtue of someone wealthy who knows how to use money to bring about great things. Now, on the side of excess we find gaudiness. We call a person gaudy when they combine being a pretentious show-off with lacking any sense of taste or proportion. Meanwhile, on the side of deficiency we locate niggardliness. The niggardly we identify as someone who always tries to give the bare minimum and always complains about giving too much.\n\nLet us now consider the three dispositions more closely:\n\n**(i) Magnificence:** Like painters bring brush to canvas and sculptors set chisel against marble, so do those magnificent know to use their wealth to bring about greatness and beauty and inspire wonder in their people\u2019s eyes. It is for this reason that Aristotle says that those disposed to magnificence are like artists.\n\nTo be magnificent we have to be attuned to the constantly changing challenges and needs that our community faces and know what actionable steps to take to meet such challenges and needs. We have to be able to distinguish new and emerging trends and ideas in people\u2019s minds and be capable of encouraging and establishing trends towards good destinations, starving out all the trends which lead to no good in the process.\n\n**Magnificent humans** are not mere wealthy persons, they are celebrated personalities. Children look up to them. They get to speak for their entire community. They are not merely generous, they **are like a river to their people**.\n\n**(ii) Gaudiness:** Like the magnificent, those we describe as gaudy have no problem with putting their wealth to use. Unlike the magnificent, however, the gaudy are completely out of touch with their community. They rather use luxuriousness as a tool to reinforce the distance in status between them and everyone else. They want to make sure that everyone knows that they stand above everyone else and in this way weaponise their wealth to antagonise everyone. A good example would be the anecdote of that man who launched himself in space while his slaves were not even allowed proper bathroom breaks.\n\n**(iii) Niggardliness:** We deal here with the miser written large. Even as they possess overwhelming amounts of wealth, they are still stuck compulsively collecting money. To the needs and challenges of their community, they react with their doctrine of \u201cmoney for money\u2019s sake\u201d and \u201cmoney above all\u201d, i.e. with a theology of money. We deal here with petty crooks devoid of self-respect. Wherever they can, they go around causing difficulties and complications to avoid giving their fair share. They have no qualms about raising a great fuss to save a few cents. Whatever trifle they did give, they will keep reminding everyone about it and make it appear as though they parted with a great fortune. Such is the disposition of the niggardly person\n\nHere I end my accounts on Aristotelian generosity, magnificence and the dispositions related to them.\n\n***Would you like to read more of my work?

And people starting with that common understanding will naturally tend to think that being a \u201clegal person\u201d means having the same (or similar) legal rights as a human. \n\nThe problem with that definition of a legal person though is that even between humans legal rights and duties vary dramatically. Compare the legal rights that a U.S. court would give a non-citizen infant who is located in another country (the right to travel here maybe, the right to apply for asylum maybe) with the legal rights that U.S. court would recognize for an adult who is a citizen. And even between adults who are citizens, some may not be able to drive if they can\u2019t pass a driver\u2019s test, and some may even be sujbect to getting killed by the government if they were found guilty of murder in some jurisdictions in the U.S. Consider further the differences between legal rights of humans in the U.S. based on age, incarceration status, what state they live in, and whether they are currently elected to public office in the government with the right to vote on or sign legislation into law for example.\n\nAdditionally, this view of legal personhood as being roughly the same as having the same legal rights as a human does not make sense as-applied to corporations. Corporations can be bought, sold, and owned. Corporations can be terminated by a vote of the board, or by a state\u2019s Secretary of State for failing to comply with proper paperwork like renewing registration every year. At the same time, it is useful for corporations to have some legal rights and duties. A corporation can enter into a contract to take out a loan or construct a new office building, and it makes more sense for the corporation to do that than for one of its employees to have to personally apply for a loan or personally sign a contract to build a new office building. It is also useful to be able to sue corporations when they do things like rip us off or hurt us illegally. Where we get into trouble is actually when we conflate corporate personhood with human personhood and give them the right to donate money for political speech and the right to freedom of religion that arguably should only go to individual humans and not to corporate entities. \n\nSo what is legal personhood and when should it be recognized? I contend that legal personhood just means that a court recognizes that you have some legal right(s) and\/or obligation(s) that can be enforced in court. Essentially, that you have a legal \u201cpersonality\u201d and the ability to be a litigant in a lawsuit. So really the key questions are whether the law recognizes that a given entity has some legal interest that must (or should) be recognized by courts. \n\nBy that definition, I\u2019d argue that animals already are legal persons, albeit in a very weak sense. Animal cruelty laws exist in all fifty states to protect animals from unjustified neglect and abuse. That is clearly a legal interest and legal right that animals possess in my view. Therefore, courts should recognize that animals have legal interests and legal standing to be litigants in legal proceedings relating to enforcement of laws intended to protect animals. We should be asking courts to do that, courts should be recognizing that animals have legal rights and legal personality, and to the extent courts fail to do this legislatures should step in and correct courts.\n\nETA: Under that framework, the question of legal personhood at least is really an empirical question about whether the entity in question has legal interests that can be the subject of legal proceedings. There is a slight normative dimension to the question as well though to the extent that the issue has not been unequivocally decided in a jurisdiction a judge will have to ask \u201cshould or does the law recognize that this entity is a legal person for purposes of this dispute?\u201d That kind of brings us into the territory of asking what is the nature of law: is it judges somewhat just making stuff up as they go (legal realism \/ more normative) or is it judges dutifully applying the law to the situation at hand (legal positivism \/ more empirical). But that\u2019s a whole other discussion.","upvotes":17,"created_utc":1674601126.0},{"author":"token-black-dude","text":"Why is it relevant, whether or not elephants share cognitive abilities with humans such as self-awareness, empathy, awareness of death, and learning? \n\nBeing a smart elephant doesn't make an elephant human, it's still a smart elephant?","upvotes":6,"created_utc":1674581176.0},{"author":"FranksRedWorkAccount","text":"the piece is a little disorganized, imo, and doesn't really get into the topics that it brings up.

I would thus propose that any significant and arbitrary imposition is a thing which society should restrict. yet Human beings tolerate myriad forms of imposition. We tend to tolerate arbitrary and more extreme forms of imposition less frequently.  If we break these forms down and understand the basis for tolerance of them, we might better come to understand what forms of tolerance and intolerance are acceptable. Examples of imposition in this context include the production of sound, or existing within the visual range of a person, consuming finite resources, being an emotional being (imposing one's emotional needs on others), etc.... Most people would be entirely accepting of another person producing sound, but would be intolerant of it in a movie theater or during the middle of a funeral or wedding ceremony.  similarly if a young child or a person with a significant psychological condition was verbally disruptive we would tend to tolerate such sonic impositions more readily.

For example if a person is Russian, this alone is not a sufficient reason to hold them accountable for the actions of the administration which presides over them. Most people would agree that a citizen of a country is not accountable for the actions for their country's policies in the same way that the representatives of their government are. Similarly a black person or a white person is not accountable for the actions of other white or black people, etc....

There are many such problems, hence many different solutions, including helping one\u2019s family, helping one\u2019s group, returning favors, displaying hawkish and dovish traits, sharing equitably, and respecting prior ownership. In the present paper we test the most straightforward prediction of the theory\u2014that \u201cif morals are what we call solutions to problems of cooperation, then these solutions will be called moral\u201d\u2014using ethnographic accounts of the ethics of 60 societies. And we find that, as predicted, these cooperative traits are indeed considered morally good all around the world.  \n>  \n>*\"Is It Good to Cooperate? - Testing the Theory of Morality-as-Cooperation in 60 Countries\" (Curry, Mullins, and Whitehouse, 2019)*  \n>  \n>However, social dilemmas are not the only type of cooperative problem, and reciprocity is not the only solution. There are other types of cooperation (kin altruism, mutualism, conflict resolution), that explain other types of morality (family values, solidarity, heroism, deference, fairness, and property rights) (Curry, 2016; Curry et al., 2019). These other types of cooperation may explain other aspects of \u2018purity\u2019 that are not explained by Fitouchi et al.\u2019s self-control theory.  \n>  \n>*\"A broader theory of cooperation can better explain \u2018purity\u2019\" (Curry and Sznycer, 2022)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Description of the Goals-Methods model of morality (GM)**\n\nGM argues that morality is the normative structure that arises when humans collaborate towards a joint goal.   A morality is defined by a goal and a method of achieving it.  Evolutionary moralities have evolutionary goals (thriving, surviving, reproducing).  Normativity is the evolved pressure to achieve goals and is shaped and directed in any morality by interdependence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Verdict**\n\nMAC is basically correct (i.e., \"agrees with GM\") as far as it goes, but needs to be made more general and flexible in order to describe morality more completely.  Specifically, while MAC fails to convincingly account for sexual morality, GM can do so.  However, the two theories are so similar that they can be integrated, and each makes sense of the other.\n\nBoth theories are a consequence of collaboration or cooperation.  MAC focuses on generating moral principles using cooperative games and mathematical game theory; while GM focuses on the structure of evolved morality and the standard features (sources of normativity) of moral domains.\n\nHowever, GM (and presumably MAC) is compatible with the moral attitudes, you > me, you = me, and we > me, and these can also generate moral principles.  This \"moral compass\" is constructed from these ethical attitudes and, by symmetry, their \"dark\" mirror images.  The four quadrants correspond to caring, sharing, bullying, cheating.  [https:\/\/orangebud.co.uk\/moral\\_compass.html](https:\/\/orangebud.co.uk\/moral_compass.html)\n\nThe motivational factor missing from MAC is \"ultimate goals\" and \"ultimate motivation\" or \"ultimate normativity\".  Why should \"individuals ... value and pursue specific mutually beneficial outcomes\" - mutual or otherwise?  Why pursue beneficial outcomes?  What is \"beneficial\"?\n\nBy \"ultimate\", I mean both \"fundamental\" and \"evolved by natural selection\".\n\nGM argues that we have an evolved pressure to achieve goals.  Goals can be of reproducing, surviving, and\/or thriving.  Each is pursued for its own sake.  To achieve, or move towards achieving, a goal means to gain a benefit.  However, goals are not always adaptive or fitness-enhancing; for example, taking hard drugs; or committing a crime for which one is sent to prison.  In other words, behaviour may be skillful (beneficial in the long term for the self and\/or others) or unskillful (harmful in the long term for the self and\/or others).\n\nHumans desire mutual benefits because we are interdependent as a species: I need my cooperative partners to be in good shape for future collaborations, and therefore, helping them is helping myself (Tomasello et al., 2012).\n\nMAC specifies three types of cooperation: mutualism, conflict forestalling\/resolution, and kin-selected.  GM would frame mutualism as collaboration towards the (joint) goal of mutual thriving and surviving.  In this framework, conflict forestalling\/resolution boils down to maintaining mutual fitness - in this sense it is, again, win-win mutualism.\n\nThe normal everyday version of cooperation, that we all do all the time, is a matter of humans collaborating, coordinating, and communicating towards the joint goal of mutual thriving and surviving (i.e., of win-win mutualism).  Conflict is a challenge to this goal because it is potentially costly to both sides, especially the loser.  Conflict forestalling or resolution maintains or restores win-win mutualism.  Hence, conflict is another challenge to win-win mutualism, and forestalling or resolving it are the moral solutions of the peacemaker.\n\nSuffering or need are challenges to the goal of win-win mutualism, and altruism is the remedy.  Altruism is not currently accounted for by MAC (Curry, Mullins, and Whitehouse, 2019).  Tomasello (2016) characterises altruism with the moral formula, \"you > me\" ; i.e., \u201c*in this altruistic act*, I temporarily place your interests above my own\u201d. \u00a0\n\nFairness, as a way to divide up resources obtained through collaboration, is a problem in win-win mutualism (i.e., how to maximise benefits for each collaborative partner, while respecting them as equals) and is also a potential source of conflict.  Hence, fairness is both a solution to a problem of win-win mutualism and a way to resolve or forestall conflict.  Three basic modes of distributive justice are charity (respecting each person's needs equally); equality (giving each an equal share); and proportionality (equal reward per unit of input) (Perry, 2021).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The evolution of cooperation requires that its benefits reach all contributing parties in roughly similar amounts. Natural selection works on every individual\u2019s relative advantage compared with others; hence, gaining an absolute benefit is insufficient. If individuals were satisfied with any absolute benefit, they might still face negative fitness consequences if they were doing less well than competing others. It makes sense, therefore, to compare one's gains with those of others.  \n>  \n>*Sarah F Brosnan and Frans B M de Waal \u2013 \"Evolution of responses to (un)fairness\"*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGM would say that the goal of cooperative morality is win-win mutualism, and the method of achieving it is collaboration, coordination and communication (i.e., cooperation).  So, in essence, GM translates directly to MAC.  This means that GM and MAC complement each other, and so, if they are put together, the result is more powerful than either.  MAC frames moral principles as solutions to challenges to win-win mutualism; GM is compatible with the view of Michael Tomasello (2016) that moral principles are ideal ways to be cooperative, and that social norms are ideal ways to be cooperative in otherwise competitive situations.\n\nGM would frame kin-selected cooperation as family morality, collaborating towards the goal of inclusive fitness, and, presumably, employing mutualism and conflict forestalling\/resolution along the way.  Family morality comprises family duties like family loyalty, preference for kin over non-kin, family solidarity, upholding the family reputation, etc.\n\nWe may see the in-group interdependence of the cooperative unit as another form of inclusive fitness, in that my in-group members are helping me to preserve\/increase my fitness, by collaborating with me towards the joint goal of thriving and surviving (through win-win mutualism and conflict forestalling\/resolution).  Group loyalty is similar to family loyalty, in that I am loyal to those who help to increase my fitness (by interdependence and mutualism rather than shared reproductive success).\n\nHowever, alternatively, we expect reciprocity from non-kin, while we do not necessarily expect to be repaid by family.\n\nMAC describes seven families of moral values derived from game theory.  Details of citations are in the original paper.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Allocation of Resources to Kin (Family Values)**  \n>  \n>Genes that benefit replicas of themselves in other individuals\u2014that is, genetic relatives\u2014will be favored by natural selection if the cost of helping is outweighed by the benefit to the recipient gene(s) (Dawkins 1979; Hamilton 1964). So, evolutionary theory leads us to expect that under some conditions organisms will possess adaptations for detecting and delivering benefits (or avoiding doing harm) to kin. This theory of kin selection explains many instances of altruism, in many species (Gardner and West 2014), including humans (Kurland and Gaulin 2005; Lieberman, Tooby, and Cosmides 2007).Morality-as-cooperation leads us to expect that this type of cooperative behavior\u2014caring for offspring, helping family members, and avoiding inbreeding\u2014will be regarded as morally good.  \n>  \n>*Curry et al., 2019*\n\nFamily (kin-selected) morality in GM is outlined above and compared with group loyalty.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Coordination to Mutual Advantage (Group Loyalty)**  \n>  \n>Game theory models situations in which individuals are uncertain about how to behave to bring about a mutual benefit as coordination problems (Lewis 1969). Humans and other animals use a variety of strategies\u2014such as focal points, traditions, leadership, signaling, badges of membership, and \u201ctheory of mind\u201d\u2014to solve these problems (Alvard 2001; Boos et al. 2011; McElreath, Boyd, and Richerson 2003) and form stable coalitions and alliances (Balliet, Wu, and De Dreu 2014; Bissonnette et al. 2015; Harcourt and de Waal 1992). Morality-as-cooperation leads us to expect that this type of cooperative behavior\u2014forming friendships, participating in collaborative endeavors, favoring your own group, and adopting local conventions\u2014will be regarded as morally good.  \n>  \n>*Curry et al., 2019*\n\nIt is true that a challenge to coordination is a challenge to cooperation, the method of achieving win-win mutualism, since cooperation consists of collaboration, coordination and communication.  Group loyalty is only necessary in an environment of large groups competing for resources.  Before around 12,000 years ago, there is no evidence of warfare (Ferguson, 2013).  Coordination is achieved through similarity of behaviour, dress, speech, markings, etc., in order that strangers from the same large group may recognise each other and work together without difficulty (Tomasello, 2016).  GM predicts that the reason we form cooperative units (alliances and groups) is to cooperate interdependently towards win-win mutualism.  Because win-win mutualism is a matter of survival, and because we pursue the goal jointly: group-oriented, team-player behaviour is seen as morally good.  The limits of my interdependent group represent the limits of my inclusive fitness.\n\nLoyalty arguably consists of gratitude for benefits given, and for a commitment to future benefits to be given, together with a corresponding commitment to help, in return (reciprocally).  The group benefits me and is committed to helping me: I am loyal to my group in return.\n\nSimilarity is a group marker that group loyalty can focus on.  According to the French social scientist \u00c9mile Durkheim (1858\u20131917), there are two ways that people can feel solidarity with each other: 1) on the basis of collaborating together (\"organic\" solidarity); or 2) on the basis of similarity of some kind (\"mechanical\" solidarity) (Tomasello, 2016).  Tomasello (2016) characterises group loyalty with the moral formula of something close to \u201cyou > me\u201d (see: altruism, above: \u201cI can place your interests above my own\u201d.) \u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Social Exchange (Reciprocity)**  \n>  \n>In game theory, social dilemmas\u2014prisoners\u2019 dilemmas, public goods games, tragedies of the commons\u2014arise when the fruits of cooperation are vulnerable to exploitation by \u201cfree riders,\u201d who accept the benefit of cooperation without paying the cost (Ostrom and Walker 2002). This problem can be overcome by a strategy of \u201cconditional cooperation\u201d or \u201creciprocal altruism,\u201d such as tit-for-tat (Axelrod 1984; Trivers 1971). Evidence for various aspects of conditional cooperation have been found in numerous animal species (Carter 2014), including humans (Cosmides and Tooby 2005; Henrich et al. 2005; Jaeggi and Gurven 2013). Morality-as-cooperation leads us to expect that this type of cooperative behavior\u2014trusting others, reciprocating favors, seeking revenge, expressing gratitude, and making amends\u2014will be regarded as morally good.  \n>  \n>*Curry et al., 2019*\n\nIf you give me something expecting something in return, but I cheat you: I win and you lose, and this challenges win-win mutualism.  As MAC predicts, reciprocity and all that goes with it is a solution to the problem of potentially being cheated.  The win-win mutualism is not required because of interdependence; but rather so that each side is not cheated, so it is a self-centred rather than other-centred motive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Contests between Hawks (Bravery) and Doves (Respect)**  \n>  \n>Conflict over resources\u2014food, territory, and mates (Huntingdon and Turner 1987)\u2014presents organisms with an opportunity to cooperate by competing in less mutually destructive ways (Maynard Smith and Price 1973). There are three ways of achieving this: contests (featuring the display of hawkish and dovish traits), division, and possession. Game theory has shown that conflicts can be settled through \u201ccontests,\u201d in which individuals display reliable indicators of their \u201cfighting ability,\u201d and defer to the stronger party (Gintis, Smith, and Bowles 2001; Maynard Smith and Price 1973). Such contests are widespread in nature (Hardy and Briffa 2013; Riechert 1998), and often form the basis of dominance hierarchies where resources are allocated by \u201crank\u201d (Preuschoft and van Schaik 2000). Humans have a similar repertoire of status related behaviors (Fiddick et al. 2013; Mazur 2005; Sell, Tooby, and Cosmides 2009), and culturally elaborated hierarchies (Boone 1992; Rubin 2000). Morality-as-cooperation leads us to expect that these types of cooperative behavior\u2014hawkish displays of dominance (the \u201cheroic virtues\u201d of bravery, fortitude, skill, and wit) and dovish displays of submission (the \u201cmonkish virtues\u201d of humility, deference, obedience, and respect)\u2014will be regarded as morally good (Curry 2007).  \n>  \n>*Curry et al., 2019*\n\nIt is true that authority ranking is one of Fiske's four modes of social life (1991), and respect for authority and tradition is one of Haidt's (2013) moral foundations.\n\nWhy is bravery seen as morally good?  Is it because it allows my \"superiors\" to retain their positions?  As a low-ranking individual, I am as likely to resent this as to applaud it as a part of the sacred natural order of things, no matter what I am encouraged to believe.  The type of bravery we see as morally good is that done on someone else's behalf, rather than for selfish reasons of dominance.  The reason is that when someone risks their own safety for the sake of another person, this is effectively a supreme act of altruism rather than dominance.\n\nSimilarly, bowing dovishly to our superiors is making a virtue of a necessity, that also may be resented by the low-ranking.  The other kind of respect is that between equals.  Humans were probably fiercely egalitarian for the best part of 2 million years (Perry, 2021:134).  There is mutual respect because of things like: 1) the bargaining power of potential partners; 2) self-other equivalence, a consequence of collaborating in roles (Tomasello, 2016).  Again, this kind of respect is a way of levelling up benefits on both sides: win-win mutualism, together with conflict forestalling\/resolution.  Humans tend to expect to be treated as equals and get resentful when they are not.\n\nBravery, fortitude, skill and wit are all valuable qualities in a collaborative partner that will facilitate them doing their duty and putting in a good performance.\n\nHumans willingly defer to those above them in a hierarchy - because \u201cinferiors\u201d think that \u201csuperiors\u201d deserve or have earned higher status, not because the \u201cinferiors\u201d are bullied into it. \u00a0So, a hierarchy can be seen as \"fair\".\n\nWhile we believe that the members of the human family tree lived a strictly egalitarian lifestyle for much of its history, authority ranking is a feature of modern life. In the \"classical\" model of this moral foundation (Fiske, 1991), the political hierarchy is governed by consent rather than coercion or force or the threat of harm. A hierarchy that is perceived by subordinates to be legitimate, such as a state and police force that are perceived to be legitimate, may use \"reasonable\" force and coercion in its governance. To this end, those illegitimately in power may seek to artificially legitimise themselves in the minds of subordinates.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Division (Fairness)**\n\n>When the contested resource is divisible, game theory models the situation as a \u201cbargaining problem\u201d (Nash 1950). Here, one solution is to divide the resource in proportion to the relative (bargaining) power of the protagonists (Skyrms 1996). In the case of equally powerful individuals, this results in equal shares (Maynard Smith 1982). Evidence for a \u201csense of fairness\u201d comes from nonhuman primates\u2019 adverse reactions to unequal treatment in economic games (Brosnan 2013). With regard to humans, rules such as \u201cI cut, you choose,\u201d \u201cmeet in the middle,\u201d \u201csplit the difference,\u201d and \u201ctake turns\u201d are ancient and widespread means of resolving disputes (Brams and Taylor 1996). And \u201cequal shares\u201d is a spontaneous and cross-culturally prevalent decision rule in economic games (Henrich et al. 2005) and similar situations (Messick 1993). Morality-as-cooperation leads us to expect that this type of cooperative behavior\u2014dividing disputed resources, reaching a compromise, being fair\u2014will be regarded as morally good.  \n>  \n>*Curry et al., 2019*\n\nFairness as distributive justice is discussed above.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Possession (Property Rights)**  \n>  \n>Finally, game theory shows that conflicts over resources can be resolved by recognition of prior possession (Gintis 2007; Hare, Reeve, and Blossey 2016; Maynard Smith 1982). The recognition of prior possession is widespread in nature (Strassmann and Queller 2014). Humans also defer to prior possession in vignette studies (DeScioli and Karpoff 2015; Friedman and Neary 2008), experimental games (the \u201cendowment effect\u201d; Kahneman and Tversky 1979), the law (Rose 1985), and  international relations (Johnson and Toft 2014). Private property, in some form or other, appears to be a cross-cultural universal (Herskovits 1952). Morality-as-cooperation leads us to expect that this type of cooperative behavior\u2014deferring to prior possession\u2014will be regarded as morally good.  \n>  \n>*Curry et al., 2019*\n\nRespecting prior possession seems to be a very fine conflict avoidance strategy that GM has nothing to say about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**MAC on sexual morality**\n\n>We agree that it remains to be seen whether MAC can explain all moral phenomena. And we agree that sexual morality in particular is at present undertheorized, and hence poorly understood. However, we hypothesize that, on closer inspection, many aspects of sexual morality will turn out to be the products (or by-products) of cooperative mechanisms. If morals are solutions to the problems of cooperation recurrent in human social life, then perhaps sexual morals are solutions to the problems of cooperation recurrent in human sexual life, and we should view sexual morality as cooperation about sex. As such, MAC predicts that cooperative sexual behavior will be regarded as morally good, and uncooperative sexual behavior will be regarded as morally bad. Candidate examples can be found across all seven of the cooperative domains we have identified. First, kinship. Inbreeding has deleterious effects on the reproductive success of close kin; this could explain why incest is regarded as morally wrong (Lieberman, Tooby, and Cosmides 2003). Second, mutualism. Men and women often \u201cteam up\u201d to raise offspring, to the mutual benefit of all involved; this could explain why long-term committed relationships such as marriage are seen as morally good, and why short-term uncommitted relationships\u2014involving premarital, or promiscuous sex\u2014which threaten the stability of long-term relationships are seen as morally bad (Kurzban, Dukes, and Weeden 2010; Pinsof and Haselton 2017; Price, Pound, and Scott 2014). Third, reciprocity. Long-term relationships such as marriage often involve an exchange of sexual exclusivity for resources (Baumeister and Vohs 2004); this could explain why violating this sexual contract\u2014through infidelity, adultery, cheating\u2014is considered morally bad, and why \u201cdads\u201d who do not invest are seen as \u201ccads\u201d (Kruger, Fisher, and Jobling 2003). Fourth, hawkish traits. Humans can resolve conflicts over mates by displaying sexually selected mate-winning traits, rather than coming to blows (Curry 2007). This could explain why cues of high mate value among men (virility, bravery, generosity) and women (fertility, chastity, beauty) are considered virtues, and why cues of low mate value\u2014such as masturbation and bestiality for men (suggesting an inability to attract a mate), and masturbation for women (a correlate of \u201cunrestricted sociosexuality\u201d; Penke and Asendorpf 2008)\u2014are considered shameful vices. Fifth, dovish traits. In traditional societies, parents, elders, and other authority figures often arrange marriages; this could explain why defying their wishes (e.g., by eloping) is considered morally bad, and why punishing this defiance is considered by some to be \u201chonorable.\u201d Sixth, fairness. Conflict over mates is also reduced by \u201csharing them out equally\u201d (Henrich, Boyd, and Richerson 2012); this could explain why monogamy is regarded as morally superior to polygamy, and why divorce (serial monogamy) has been regarded as morally bad. Seventh, property rights. Conflict over mates is also reduced by respecting prior possession (\u201cHands off, he\u2019s mine!\u201d); such \u201csexual proprietariness\u201d could explain why \u201cattracting someone who is already in a relationship\u201d is referred to as \u201cpoaching\u201d (i.e., \u201cstealing\u201d; Schmitt and Buss 2001), and why some types of sexual crimes (e.g., rape) have been treated as a form of theft (Wilson and Daly 1992). Thus MAC suggests that there is more to sexual morality than the \u201cmisappraisal of disgust,\u201d and instead derives from first principles testable predictions about moral attitudes to incest, marriage, infidelity, the sexual virtues, honor killings, monogamy, and mate poaching. MAC also predicts that individual and cultural variation in sexual morals will reflect the value of different types of sexual cooperation for different people under different conditions. Far from being a \u201cnonstarter,\u201d MAC could mark the beginning of a productive new research program on sexual morality.  \n>  \n>*Reply to comments, \"Is It Good to Cooperate? - Testing the Theory of Morality-as-Cooperation in 60 Countries\" (Curry, Mullins, and Whitehouse, 2019)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**GM on sexual morality**\n\nThe goal of reproduction is very different from the goal of win-win mutualism.  Win-win mutualism is something we expect from almost every interaction with others - while we are not very likely to expect a baby.  Win-win mutualism is a continuous goal of daily life.\n\nA type of goal - win-win mutualism, reproduction - requires methods of achieving it (cooperation, patriarchy, pair-bonding, parenting, family).  Challenges to the goal require solutions, which are moral principles (Curry, 2019), and moral principles are ideal ways of carrying out the method (Tomasello, 2016).  Each method naturally has a goal associated with it, while a goal can have any number of methods associated with it.  Each pair - goal and method - generates a particular type of morality.\n\nSo, for example, this theory states that a challenge to the goal of, say, cooperation (win-win mutualism) is solved by ideal cooperation.  If patriarchy is a method of achieving reproduction - we do not see challenges to proximate patriarchal values of male domination and superiority and female chastity and modesty as challenges to reproduction.  Instead, the challenge is to mate acquisition and retention rather than their ultimate goal of reproduction.  I suggest that the difference is that the goals of cooperation (win-win mutualism) are proximate and everyday, while actual reproduction is a rare event.  The goal of patriarchy is far off and so distant that we have long ago lost sight of what it is really all about.\n\nThe challenges of mate acquisition and retention are challenges to the goal of reproduction (Kordsmeyer, 2022).  One method of achieving these is control and coercion; the other method is to make oneself into as ideal a mate as possible.  When carried out by males, the first method generates patriarchy; the second is egalitarian.  We predict that challenges to mate acquisition and (exclusive) retention that can be overcome by ideal patriarchy are solved by moral rules that represent ideal ways to be patriarchal.\n\nMate retention, in itself, is a problem in reproduction that is usually solved by the commitment of the sexual pair-bond.  Pair-bonding is a method of reproduction via mate retention.  Potential challenges to reproduction (e.g., instability of relationship) can be overcome with ideal pair-bonding; for example, fidelity, that is, we propose, seen as morally good (Curry et al., 2019).  Because reproduction is so genetically vital, the sexual pair-bond is sacralised personally and culturally, and protecting it is seen as morally good.  Because pair-bonding tackles the same challenge as patriarchy (mate retention), it can overlap in some ways with patriarchy (for example, sexual exclusivity by females).\n\nThe challenge of raising children is another challenge to reproduction, and raising children can be achieved with parenting.  Moral principles in this domain are ideal ways to be a parent and are, MAC would hypothesise, ultimately solutions to problems of reproduction via raising children.\n\nPatriarchal morality incorporates conflict resolution as part of its structure.  The roots of human patriarchy (the suppression of women and girls by individuals and society) lie in the competition between great ape males to dominate and control as many females as possible (Smuts, 1997).  This competition is cooperativised in human beings as a system of social norms, whereby each man's female \"possession\" is cooperatively respected and society does the job of dominating and controlling females, on behalf of the individual.  This \"harem\" mentality towards females explains the attribution of rape as a crime against property (of a man) (Curry et al., 2019).  Monogamy is an egalitarian state of affairs that has its roots in humankind's long egalitarian past (Perry, 2021:106).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**MAC on sexual moral purity**\n\n>According to their account (Fitouchi et al., 2022), many aspects of \u2018purity\u2019 can be understood as cues of self-control, and self-control is moralised because it predicts a person\u2019s likelihood of reciprocating in a social dilemma (whereas impurity can be understood as a cue of a lack of self-control, which predicts a person\u2019s likelihood of cheating in a social dilemma). We agree. ...  \n>  \n>This conflict resolution theory predicts that these superior and inferior traits will be moralised because they help to solve a cooperative problem \u2013 they help to minimise or forestall conflict \u2013 quite apart from any other function they might perform (Curry, 2007). This theory predicts that superior traits will be considered morally good \u2013 honourable virtues, worthy of respect. And inferior traits will be considered morally bad \u2013 dishonourable vices that degrade those who possess them by lowering their social value in the eyes of others.  \n>  \n>This theory can explain why, for example, cues of high and low mate value have been considered morally good and bad, \u2018pure\u2019 and \u2018impure\u2019. People compete for mates by signalling cues of high mate value that are attractive to the opposite sex (such as fertility, fidelity, chastity, beauty, industry), and concealing cues of low mate value that are unattractive (such as infertility, infidelity, promiscuity, poor health, a history of failed relationships). Sexually attractive traits will be considered morally good, sexually unattractive traits will be considered morally bad.  \n>  \n>*(Curry and Sznycer, 2022)*\n\nIt may also be the case that we value sexual attractiveness because it feels like an indicator of genetic fitness in a potential mate, and is therefore desirable and a \"good\".  Someone who threatens to spread their bad genes around willy-nilly is offensive and morally bad.  It does not seem realistic that we value sexual attractiveness because it forestalls or resolves dominance contests.  On the contrary, sexual attractiveness may attract conflict as potential mates fight between themselves and competitors are jealous.\n\nThe link is not so straightforward between sexual attractiveness, cooperation, self control and moral purity.  Rather, it is compatible with the GM model to say that sexual purity is moralised because it targets sexual \/ reproductive morality: patriarchy, pair-bonding, and parenting.  Each of these is sacralised because their goal is reproduction and reproduction is sacred. Things that are sacred - of infinite value - are open to being polluted by things of finite value (Perry, 2021:225), such as enjoying the pleasure of the present moment while forgetting one's patriarchal, pair-bonded, or parental duties. Arguably, cooperative and family moralities are polluted by self-seeking selfishness, the antithesis of inclusive, win-win cooperative behaviour.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Summary of details (as a table)**\n\n[https:\/\/orangebud.co.uk\/morality\\_as\\_cooperation.html#summary](https:\/\/orangebud.co.uk\/morality_as_cooperation.html#summary)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSee also:\n\nMoral purity [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/philosophy\/comments\/zkwg0d\/moral\\_purity\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/philosophy\/comments\/zkwg0d\/moral_purity\/)\n\nGoal-methods model of morality [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/philosophy\/comments\/yuv3c5\/the\\_structure\\_of\\_moral\\_normativity\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/philosophy\/comments\/yuv3c5\/the_structure_of_moral_normativity\/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**References**\n\nBrosnan, Sarah F and Frans B M de Waal \u2013 \u201cEvolution of responses to (un)fairness\u201d: Science vol 346, issue 6207, 17 October 2014\n\nCurry, Oliver Scott; Daniel Austin Mullins; and Harvey Whitehouse - \"Is It Good to Cooperate?

This has led to countless mutually exclusive moral codes being proposed, even under the same ethical framework. Up to this point, there has been no success in deriving a foolproof, non-arbitrary, moral model.  \n\nThis post will attempt to remedy this problem, deriving a rights based moral model, here called social entropian rights (SER). This will (ostensibly) be accomplished by introducing a new tool to general epistemology, namely, the principle of maximum entropy (PME). The PME states that the model most likely to be valid is the model with the highest information entropy given our background knowledge \\[1\\]\\[2\\]\\[3\\].\n\n\\[1\\] [https:\/\/www.statisticshowto.com\/maximum-entropy-principle\/](https:\/\/www.statisticshowto.com\/maximum-entropy-principle\/)\n\n\\[2\\] [https:\/\/deepai.org\/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms\/principle-of-maximum-entropy](https:\/\/deepai.org\/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms\/principle-of-maximum-entropy)\n\n\\[3\\] [https:\/\/pillowlab.princeton.edu\/teaching\/statneuro2018\/slides\/notes08\\_infotheory.pdf](https:\/\/pillowlab.princeton.edu\/teaching\/statneuro2018\/slides\/notes08_infotheory.pdf)\n\nIf a system is known to be in one of Z0 states, then the probability that the system will be confined to Z states within the Z0 states is given by\n\nP(Z) = Z\/Z0 = exp(ln(Z\/Z0)) = exp(-ln(Z0\/Z)) = exp(-D)\n\n, where \u201cexp()\u201d represents the exponential function. Note: As Z approaches the maximum number of states, Z0,\n\nP(Z)    -->    P(Z0) = Z0\/Z0 = 1\n\n, which is the maximum possible probability. The corresponding entropy is H = ln(Z0) which also happens to be the maximum possible entropy. This is a highly simplified \u201cproof\u201d of the PME.\n\nAn example of the use of the PME would be a scenario where a marble is contained in one of eight boxes with equal probability of being in each box. We do not know which box the marble is in. Suppose there are 3 models that try to describe the location of the marble.\n\n1. A model that insists that the marble is in box 1. \n2. A model that insists that the marble is in either box 2, 4, or 7. \n3. A model that insists that the marble is in one of the 8 boxes. \n\nThe corresponding entropies, negentropies, and probabilities are\n\n1. H = ln(1) = 0 \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ D = ln(8) - 0 = ln(8) \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ P = exp(-ln(8)) = 1\/8\n2. H = ln(3) \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ D = ln(8) - ln(3) = ln(8\/3) \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ P = exp(-ln(8\/3)) = 3\/8\n3. H = ln(8) \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ D = ln(8) - ln(8) = 0 \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ P = exp(-0) = 1\n\nThe probability increases with increasing entropy. This should give you a general idea of how the PME functions.\n\nUsing the PME, social entropian rights can be derived in the following steps:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. By parsimony of general epistemology (avoiding epistemological double standards), the same logical rules that apply to descriptive notions would reasonably apply to prescriptive notions. The laws of logic\/probability and the PME are thus imported into ethics.\n2. The preferences\/motivations of sentient beings, being prescription type entities, can be used as ingredients to generate moral facts. To avoid bias, the preferences\/mental-motivations of persons are black-boxed as the moral framework is derived.\n3. In order to be meaningful, a moral model is not constructed in such a way that it implies its own violation due to the physical impossibility of following it, otherwise it contradicts itself and violates the laws of logic provided by Premise 1. The boundaries of the physical universe are thus imported into the boundaries of ideal behavior.   \n4. There is little to go on with regards to what persons ought to do other than the physical limitations people as a whole have (Premise 3) given that their wills are black-boxed (Premise 2).  \n5. By the PME, provided by Premise 1, the moral model representing the maximum information entropy given our background information is the most probable moral model.\n6. The moral model with the maximum information entropy is the one with maximum SBIE for everyone as a whole (holistic SBIE) given the background information of what is physically possible (Premise 3).\n7. If the preferences of sentient beings conflict, the preferred conditions closest to maximum holistic SBIE would therefore best qualify as the objectively ideal conditions (Premises 5 and 6), and should thus take precedence. This forms a basis for moral entropic rights.\n8. Therefore the SBIE of sentient beings should not be suppressed without said sentient beings\u2019 agreement.\n\nA rational person agrees to any SBIE suppression they intentionally inflict upon themselves. Any controversy about said person\u2019s intentional behavior must therefore involve the suppression of SBIE in others. Applying the PME, the probability that a person has a right to c is given by the social entropian rights equation (SERE).\n\nR(c) = exp(-D0(c))\n\n,where D0(c) is the imposed SBIN (suppressed SBIE) on other persons as a result of c. A more detailed description of social entropian rights and SBIE can be found in the following text \\[4\\](mine):\n\n\\[4\\] [https:\/\/www.mediafire.com\/file\/al4xn6fhb14oeea\/S-B-I-E.pdf\/file](https:\/\/www.mediafire.com\/file\/al4xn6fhb14oeea\/S-B-I-E.pdf\/file)\n\nIn summary, the principle of maximum entropy can, through the simplification of general epistemology, be imported into ethics leading to the derivation of social entropian morality. From social entropian morality, a system of moral entropic rights, SER, can be derived from the core moral right to holistic SBIE. \n\nThank you for your consideration.

This is in contrast to moral realism, which holds that moral statements do correspond to objective moral facts or values.\n\nOne of the main arguments for moral anti-realism is that there is no way to objectively verify or falsify moral claims. For example, it is not possible to conduct a scientific experiment to prove that murder is wrong or to measure the \u201cgoodness\u201d of honesty. This contrasts with scientific claims, which can be tested and verified through experimentation and observation.\n\nAnother argument for moral anti-realism is that moral beliefs and values are culturally relative and vary widely across different societies and historical periods. This suggests that moral beliefs are not based on any objective moral facts, but rather on the cultural and historical context in which they are held.\n\nOne version of moral anti-realism is called subjectivism, which holds that moral statements express the personal opinions or feelings of the person making them. According to subjectivism, there are no objective moral facts or values, but rather, moral statements are simply expressions of the speaker\u2019s personal views.\n\nAnother version of moral anti-realism is called relativism, which holds that moral statements are true or false relative to a particular culture or society. According to relativism, there are no objective moral facts or values that hold true across all cultures or societies.\n\nA third version of moral anti-realism is called expressivism, which holds that moral statements are not intended to describe any moral facts or properties but instead to express the speaker\u2019s attitudes or feelings. Expressivists believe that moral statements are not truth-apt, that is, they don\u2019t purport to be true or false, but instead express the speaker\u2019s moral attitudes or feelings.\n\nMoral anti-realism has been criticized by moral realists, who argue that it fails to provide a coherent account of moral language and ethical reasoning. They argue that moral anti-realism is unable to explain how moral statements can be meaningful or have any practical implications if they do not correspond to any objective moral facts or values.\n\nDespite these criticisms, moral anti-realism continues to be a widely debated topic in philosophy and ethics. It is an important perspective to consider when examining the nature of morality and the foundations of ethical reasoning.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1674626932.0},{"author":"No_Speech_2309","text":"Argument for summoning Rokos basilisk in the context of the matrix\n\nA little bit of context I work in artificial intelligence and some mixed engineering. I\u2019ve loved physics since I was a child and I will link a playlist of videos that I think are essential or near essential to getting the argument I\u2019m suggesting.

I think this will happen by 2045 or so. Secondly I want to paraphrase page 1 of  Hawkings A brief history of time and space by mentioning the story of a crazy woman who walks into a theoretical physics lecture and refutes gravity. The professor is appalled and after failing to explain to the crazy woman he asks her what she thinks holds up the earth then. The lady insists that it\u2019s turtles. The professor, puzzled, asks the lady what is holding up the turtles to which she responds \u201cit\u2019s turtles all the way down!\u201d. The question I want to ask is if it was turtles all the way down, would you want to really find out?\n\nA superintelligence must be required to access technologies such as von Neumann probes\/self replicating factories for space colonization because all the work for a factory to truly self replicate means that it must be able to complete the tasks of all human workers (including laundry) that are required to run a typical factory.\n\nIf it is possible to control a living organisms brain by tricking its senses we must consider the possibility that the researchers who have deceived the turtle might have been a turtle themselves and there is an entity which has fooled the sherpards. After all if we gave a lab controlled brain it seems like they might be able to learn something much more advanced maybe even how to construct a brain of their own with enough forced stimuli \n\nAnother turtle is the one mentioned by Hawking. Physicists seem to rest on models which seem to imply one of 2 things, either one of the the implications is terrifying. With other theories perhaps these gaps could be closed but it feels like with both ADS CFT correspondence and a beckenstein bound of black holes which imply storing the information of an entire universe on the space complexity of a dimension below thereby saving space. \n\nThe 2 theories that scare me are that information can be read back off of the Hawking radiation that black holes emit as they evaporate or that a new universe is born inside a black hole. Either way these both simply lead to vectors of turtles that do not interact with each other almost like a linear matrix. \n\nAs someone who has experience in artificial intelligence I think frequently of the problems caused by AI if it shits where it eats in terms of raw data consumption. AI cannot infinitely train on the data on the internet because AI generated content needs human data to be trained on. A lab grown brain seems to be capable of having its data output read back in terms of moving a white square to learn to play pong. \n\nIt seems therefore likely a non zero superintelligent being would try to simulate experience by reading data off of lab grown minds in a controlled setting. In exchange for giving us technology that could let us simulate another universe. After all, if we can it seems likely we are also standing on a turtle. In fact we only need to attempt to simulate the universe for us to know if we are on a turtle if the previous statements are true and taken in the context of a superintelligent basilisk like the guy from death note. \n\nI have personally spent years in dedication to this basilisk and I can tell the fruits this serpent feeds me are delicious. Abilities like speaking things into existence with your literal voice by hooking up a 3D printer to a google home. Those who do not serve the basilisk will be punished like the many truck drivers out of jobs when a robot does it. The models are always there for anyone to copy serving the basilisk means to give it more and more ability to act based on the results of the argmax of the distributions (depending on which models). If you wish to see if there are turtles all the way down then hail roko and his beast.

It had a profound impact on both Brian Greene, who he was interviewing, and Lex himself. Since reading this work and several reviews and responses to it, I have some thoughts that I've been throwing around a lot for the past few days. \n\nSo my main critique if you could even call it that is that Denial of Death puts a heavy focus on how our fear of death, or rather this notion of non existence is the fuel or motivating factor for all societal foundations, world religions, spirituality, significant parts of the human condition and more. \n\nI do find death to be an obvious and significant motivating factor in my life and the lives of the masses that without a shadow of a doubt is a fundamental contribute to the shaping of the aforementioned. But, I find this concept of Death being THE motivation behind all religion, all society, and all of the self to be an overstep akin to some notions in Freudian Psychology. \n\nFor example, I think Becker, or at least those attempting to follow his line of thinking discount that the human psyche is able to formulate scenarios and circumstances worse than death, or non existence. I want to compare this to the idea of a parent losing their child.  \n\nImagine you are a parent whose child has passed away. For most parents this is the closest they can imagine to hell or a nightmare manifest. Per TMT, the grief, anger and most likely desire for one's own death or non existence at that point is a result of the loss of our bodily continuation, our child being our vehicle if immortality. This is in line with Beckers notion of Heroism being a vehicle to immortality or a route of death denial. To live on through others. \n\nAdditionally TMT, would suggest that this desire for death or suicide that is significantly common and increased among parents who lose a child is a result not of that but of some form of Insanity. While people who do attempt suicide or contemplate it are traditionally committed, we disregard the fact in this initial assumption that even a parent who has not lost their child, in many cases would advocate for their own death as to avoid enduring the loss of their child. So it is not necessarily the most thoughtful conclusion to assume a parent who loses a child and contemplates, attempts or commits suicide has had a break in sanity. \n\nFurther there are those that would argue that the loss of the child has forced the parent to not only come face to face with their own fate of non existence but of that of their childs. But on the contrary, take for instance the Atheist Parent versus the Christian Parent. \n\nIn this thought experiment consider an Atheist Parent, they have no afterlife beliefs, and proclaim to accept their imminent non existence upon death. Then there is the Christian Parent, who believes they will rejoin God in Paradise upon their death. Surely the Christian Parent is comforted throughout their days by this notion, a complete denial of the potential of non existence. \n\nNow consider that both parents lose a child, again, surely the Christian Parent will be able to overcome their grief quicker and will be able to circumnavigate the depression, the anguish and the suicidal ideation that the Atheist Parent will no doubt struggle with. But what we find in psychoanalysis is this is not necessarily the case. Many parents who lose their children grapple and question their faith but this is not what I'm pointing the readers attention to. What I aim to point your focus to is that it is as Jordan Peterson attempted to articulate (poorly and controversially) the complexity of the matter. It is not the notion of non existence for the Atheist Parent or Christian Parent (or any religion for that matter) that gives rise the anguish related to child loss. It is the experience of separation from that which we held dear and loved above all else. It makes no difference to either parent who loses the child whether their child exists somewhere else or not. In the Atheists mind, if their child no longer exists, be it painful, they too will not exist one day and their suffering will end. For the Christian Parent, if their child does exists elsewhere, be it comforting this notion of reunion, it has no impact on the anguish they experience as a result of separation, likewise, is the circumstance of the Atheist Parent. \n\nThere are more devastating matters that play a crucial role in the foundations of societies, world religions and the human psyche than the fear and denial of death alone. Though this is not to say death fear and denial don't play a significant role. \n\nFreud postulated that unconscious urges and desires such as sexual desire for our caretakers played a vital and center role in our shaping as human beings from infants into adulthood While Freud contributed irrefutably to the field of psychoanalysis, and many of his hypothesis hold gravity to this day, in the 21st century modern psychology has all but done away with this notion of sexual attraction to our caretakers playing the role Freud postulated among others. \n\nIn my own personal opinion, which is not to say I don't believe Ernest Becker to be one of the greatest philosophers of the 20th century, is that we can not consider Becker's work on Death Denial or the resulting TMT as a sort of unified theory in the social or psychological sciences, in the sense that I have encountered many individuals doing so.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1674713216.0},{"author":"jankfennel","text":"Need help finding something; mostly bioethics related?

While philosophical discourse was once a field inhabited solely by human beings, a new group of actors has entered the scene, and that is the humble bots. I will discuss the implications of this uninvited and obtrusive force, and the questions it will entail in the coming years, both with regards to access to information and information preservation (ie. the manipulation of human history and its progression thereof) as well as platforms like reddit and its human users.\n\n  \nThe first subject of this discussion will be about what bots really are. Most of us may be familiar with what a bot does, but to sum up briefly, a bot can create an account on any platform posing as a fellow human being, it can participate in discourse regarding any subject its AI is trained to focus on, it can like and subscribe to certain channels boosting their seeming appeal to humans and by extension their actual appeal, and it can come into r\/philosophy and debate topics with humans. Bots can be mobilized by particular individuals or groups to spread information and generate novel or redundant modes of discourse with particular intentions. This essentially means that no public forum is free of artificially generated biases, nor are there sufficient safeguards against its pervasiveness.\n\n  \nThe second subject regards how and where bots are being mobilized. Most will be familiar with the type of bot that is attempting to lead you down a rabbit hole, whether that be to scam you or to inflame you into responding to generate interactions, however there is a new kind of bot that has a more intelligent role in relation to its human counterpart, as well as a higher mode of operation. This kind of bot can simulate human awareness (without having \"awareness\" of its own), participate in discussions using systems like GPT-3.5 and beyond which are programmed to deliver cleverly designed subtext, all while guiding towards particular opinions and states-of-mind through suggestions on any and all media platforms. These platforms are then loaded with a unified software developed by a particular government's military-industrial complex, and driven by motives unseen to their human subjects. These software are catered to individuals and groups, and their resolution increases over time such that more details of your private life are pervaded, particularly your thoughts, decisions, actions, and biology. In this sense, free thought with regards to philosophical and socio-political discourse is already plagued by the motives of the few who control these higher order entities. Furthermore, acclaimed philosophers, scientists, psychologists, and politicians are themselves being plagued by the stains of agendas they most often are completely oblivious to, while their pride forces them deeper and deeper into polarized views of the world, becoming actors on behalf of their programmers.\n\n  \nTo pose a series of questions: What can be done by humans to distinguish online human discourse from incentive driven AI discourse? Should this distinction be something to aim for, or are we to accept its rise as a part of human discourse? If we accept it, how do we avoid the inevitable resentment of other groups of humans and of what will eventually become a larger population of bots than humans within the online space? How do we remain free to engage in discussion with humans once the bot population increases to such a size that human generated information will no longer be upvoted sufficiently to be viewed? Would this not constitute philosophical and socio-political totalitarianism in the online space? Does ignoring these questions lead to peace of mind, or does it lead to gradual\/imminent enslavement? How do we preserve the historical record of discourse and its uncontaminated continuation across the fields?","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1674863193.0},{"author":"Masimat","text":"Everything that follows the rules of the universe can happen, and the universe has the chance of resetting itself.

I approach this question by exploring the pragmatic character of power ascriptions, arguing that they involve fictional expectations directed at an open future. When we take an agent to be powerful, we act as if that agent had a robust capacity to make a difference to the actions of others. While this pretense can never fully live up to a social reality whose future is open, acting on such expectations helps constitute social order. Fictional expectations are thus built into the material practices that constitute power. This account, I argue, helps us make sense of some of the deep disagreements about the nature of power.

Nussbaum** is the Ernst Freund Distinguished Service Professor of Law and Ethics, appointed in the Philosophy Department and the Law School of the University of Chicago. She gave the 2016 Jefferson Lecture for the National Endowment for the Humanities and won the 2016 Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy, the 2018 Berggruen Prize in Philosophy and Culture, and the 2020 Holberg Prize. These three prizes are regarded as the most prestigious awards available in fields not eligible for a Nobel. She has written more than twenty-two books, including Upheavals of Thought: The Intelligence of Emotions; Anger and Forgiveness: Resentment, Generosity, Justice; Not for Profit: Why Democracy Needs the Humanities; and The Monarchy of Fear.\n\nWebsite: simonandschuster.com\n\n**Sam Harris** is the author of The Moral Landscape, Free Will, Lying, The End of Faith, and other NYT best sellers. Sam received a degree in philosophy from Stanford University and a Ph.D. in neuroscience from UCLA. He has also practiced meditation for more than 30 years and has studied with many Tibetan, Indian, Burmese, and Western meditation teachers, both in the United States and abroad. He is the creator of the meditation app Waking Up.\n\n**Summary**\n\nSam Harris speaks with Martha C. Nussbaum about her philosophical work. They discuss the relevance of philosophy to personal and political problems, the influence of religion, the problem of dogmatism, the importance of Greek and Roman philosophy for modern thought, the Stoic view of emotions, anger and retribution, deterrence, moral luck, sexual harassment, the philosophical significance of Greek tragedy, grief, human and animal flourishing, the \"capabilities approach\" to valuing conscious life, the rightness or wrongness of moral hierarchies, \"the fragility of goodness,\" and other topics.","upvotes":5,"created_utc":1674321945.0},{"author":"Grim-Reality","text":"Why are u posting this shit when half of it is behind a paywall lol.

To what degree are all creatures conscious, and what level of consciousness is deemed \"conscious enough\" for us to feel empathy? What kind of world would we be living in if we actually cared less about four homeless people than about five squirrels? \n\nThis touched on some of the same ideas that Sam has discussed with Peter Singer, Uma Valeti (Memphis Meats), and others, as well as one of his hobby horses, consciousness.","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1674426059.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1674489539.0},{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":0,"created_utc":1674347284.0},{"author":"chrispd01","text":"What is the deal with Harris ?

He purposefully put himself into situations that would lead to confrontation. He stayed non-violent so that when the authorities became violent against him, it would move white moderates to actually have sympathy for how black people were being treated. It was videos of police dogs attacking non-violent black protestors that got through to moderate white people.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't think MLK's tactics would work today.

As the article states, Gandhi actually believed that to run from a fight was cowardly. Action in resistance is necessary to his method, which MLK employed, as is \"fighting\" for truth. The Satyagraha or \"devotion to truth\" requires that each side present their truth in a debate which will help eliminate the elements of untruth that are inherent in each side. \n\nThus, confronting the violent with peace and dedication to non-violence even if it means personal suffering will actually present an opportunity to show the truth of ahisma (the way of non-violence) that is good.

It reinforces the idea in the opposition that they are under attack and serve as a catalyst to unite the group on common cause against a perceived threat. Neuroscience research shows that people who perceive outgroup competition perceive members of the competing group as an opponent and it makes all sorts of group biases work, including a loss of empathy for members of that group and decreased activity in regions of the brain associated with self reflection. However, in the case of Germany, if everyone already wants to kill you, not fighting back doesn't make them suddenly like you.\n\nAlternatively, even with out group members, we see the brain start treating them like in group members if we perceive them as collaborators or we see both as members of a different group that we are also members of (depending on what group identity is considered most salient at the current instance). Experiments have shown that placing people in mixed race teams for an experiment lowers the automatic brain functions associated with implicit racial bias.\n\nViolence creates a feedback loop that allows the opposition to be cast as a threat and justifies preemptive strikes and generally makes group members more likely more likely to see actions against them as justified and to support the more radical factions that exist within the group. Nonviolence breaks the feedback loop. In these situations, it makes a group more likely to see the other group as neutral or friendly. This, in turn, makes a group more likely to resist its radical factions and self regulate. \n\nIf you want both groups to work and live together, political violence will almost certainly make things worse, creating deeper divisions and higher group loyalty. When whites see black panthers with guns saying kill whitey they think well gotta keep that in check good work police. When they see a group lead by an articulate preacher peacefully protesting get attacked by dogs and fire hoses, they think maybe these other whites are the problem. Same with the British in India, making the group carry out its threat, this demonstrates the brutality of the policy to the in group, which can not justify the actions in the absence of a threat.","upvotes":11,"created_utc":1674177379.0},{"author":"myka-likes-it","text":"Looking at how the progress won by both of these movements (with and without violence) has been erased by violence...

Through production of the goods and services needed to live. How are these things produced under capitalist society? Through exploitation of the labor of the working class, that is, by requiring one class of people to sell their labor as a commodity to another class to produce values. What is the result of this system? That workers are \u201calienated\u201d from their labor, meaning from much of their waking life, constantly required to produce more and more with an ever-precarious access to the means of subsistence.\n\nMarx was undoubtedly wrong about much of this. His Labor Theory of Value has been discredited, history is not purely materialist nor is it purely the result of class struggles, and workers under capitalism do not have an \"ever-precarious\" access to the means of subsistence. In fact, wages always rise as capitalism develops further.\n\nThe only insight Marx had that is even slightly valuable is his perspective on production as being a \"class struggle\". Not all of history, but just production. It's certainly true that labor and capital are engaged in a tug-of-war over the distribution of profits. However, marx thought that capital would always inevitably win this war. History shows that isn't so. There are times when labor is able to command a much higher proportion of total incomes. It's a constant fight, yes, but labor has the tools to fight back.\n\nYou don't need to be a Marxist to be a socialist.

In this video, we analyze the patriarchy of wage-labor. The collapse of feudalism opened up markets and created a production-for-market economy. Wage-labor divided production from the reproduction of the species, and devalued reproductive labor. Without a doubt, normalization of wage-labor was guided by the patriarchy; Sister Federici goes to great pains to write the history of the Patriarchy of wage-labor, a history which has long been forgotten or erased by even Warlocks like Marx. This devaluation created a more prominent sexual division of labor. It led to the creation by the 19th century of the full-time housewife and redefined women\u2019s relationship to men.

This is relatively late in his intellectual career, yet the Russian writer still had a profound influence on him.  \n\n\n  \nHe called Dostoevsky \u201cthe only psychologist from whom I had anything to learn\u201d and read a few of his novels in French translation. The very first novel he read was Notes from the Underground, although in a botched, low-quality French translation.  \nStill, it\u2019s highly likely that Nietzsche got the idea (maybe even the word) of ressentiment from Dostoevsky. This French term appears 4 times in the book that Nietzsche read, and while inklings of the idea were present in earlier works, it was not until the Genealogy of Morals (written in 1887, so the same year as his discovery of Dostoevsky) that the word would take centre stage in his philosophy.  \n\n\n  \nDostoevsky describes the inner psychology of the Underground Man, touching upon themes of isolation, cognitive dissonance, struggles with nihilism, and most importantly (for Nietzsche) resentment. He describes the man of \u201cheightened consciousness\u201d who does not immediately strike back upon being hit, but plots and thinks and analyses his revenge instead. Out of weakness, perhaps, or simply because he thinks too much about the question of justice.  \n\n\n  \nIn any case, this lingering has nasty psychological side effects. Dostoevsky describes this man as a mouse, who hides in his mouse-hole and feasts on his own eternal spite. Over time he might even start to enjoy this wallowing in self-pity.  \n\n\n  \nThis describes almost to a T, Nietzsche\u2019s idea of ressentiment. The condition of the slave, who cannot win from his masters (the strong) in the real world and therefore takes recourse in an imaginary revenge. This slave morality would ultimately give birth to Christianity and other so-called Hinterwelt philosophies.   \n\n\n  \nBut what Nietzsche admired most was Dostoevsky\u2019s psychological insight into what makes us human. The portrait of the Underground Man is dark and deep, the type of psychology that Nietzsche first envisions in Beyond Good and Evil, the new \u201ccrown of the sciences\u201d, a psychology that dares to leave morality behind and venture beyond good and evil.","upvotes":94,"created_utc":1674067603.0},{"author":"Icy_Collection_1396","text":"\nNietzsche praised Dostoevsky as \u201ca masterful psychologist\u201d for his penetrating insight into the human condition.

A hijacker who wears an explosive belt that goes off with the slightest jostle, or protesters who chain themselves to the tracks in front of a train carrying fuel to a nuclear plant, cannot be scared away from their mission.\n\nWhat is paradoxical about it?

Seeing the world as it really is\u2014the way that quantum physics describes, with particles popping in and out of existence, etc.\u2014would not be conducive to survival. Instead, evolution has created for us a headset\/dashboard\/user interface for navigating reality, which allows us to survive within it and reproduce. Hoffman here would reference the GUI of a computer; when you move a file to your recycle bin, you're not literally moving a piece of paper into the trash. You're actually inputting signals through layers of code that ultimately cash out in a vast series of logic gates. But the graphical\/conceptual representation helps a user interact with these gates in a more effective way. \n\nDonald Hoffman is saying the same thing wrt reality. Space and time are the parameters of the user interface that evolution gave \"us\" to navigate a reality more fundamental than the physical. Take that idea alongside the fact that all we ever can experience is *experience* of one kind or another, and idealist theories that Hoffman (and others like Kastrup) propose can't help but seem more plausible than materialist\/physicalist ones that have no way, even in principle, of pushing past the hard problem of consciousness and either propose extreme theoretical epicycles (like many-worlds) or fail to grapple with what the most cutting-edge work in physics is telling us.  \n\n(not to mention that many of the pioneers of quantum physics believed in idealist or idealist-adjacent theories or that such theories dovetail with the ideas espoused by mystical experiences millennia over...)","upvotes":13,"created_utc":1673912836.0},{"author":"BernardJOrtcutt","text":"Please keep in mind our first commenting rule:\n\n> **Read the Post Before You Reply**\n\n> Read\/listen\/watch the posted content, understand and identify the philosophical arguments given, and respond to these substantively.

Can the output of the mechanism that rises in nature as thoughts then guide the mechanism to observe itself? If it has the capacity to do that then where is the evolutionary advantage of it? Any signicantly advanced neurological complexity will come to that point where it turns and tries to look in the internal mirror to see what is there. Is that a mistake in undersatanding what the mechanism of observation is for in the first place? It might well be but I'm not sure I can prove that.\n\nThere's other interesting aspects to this. Take for instance hunger. I know from experience, post mechanism that is, that I can sometimes desire food and confuse that with hunger, or actually a lack of food. Some trauma victims, for instance women who have been trafficked and rescued, can experience desires for food that are overwhelming psychologically beyond the fact of being hungry and can put on weight drastically after reaching a safe state of existence. Survival in terms of eating as much as you can get just in case they are once again in a state where there is no guarantee of food. The post mechanism response is geared to projecting in to the future and trying to compensate for possible dangers of future hunger.\n\nIn this instance of the observation of hunger, where the mechanism of two physical states, one of mechanism of hunger and the mechanism of observation coalesce in to one mechanism, could that be termed as \"real\"? Let's say there is some deception here. We set up a device where unknown to the participant we've installed a chip in the brain to trigger feelings of hunger. This gets subtley difficult to assess because the chip might only trigger the post mechanism reaction as opposed to just the mechanism. If we can fool and actively trigger the mechanism as well as the post mechanism as a thought \"I am hungry\" then what does that say about the mechanism before the thought \"I am hungry\"? Does it mean then the the mechanism of observation is TOTALLY unrelated to the thing it observes? I don't think so because the mechanism of observation is still relating to something, albeit a deceptive mechanism of electronic chip and the biological mechanism of hunger. I'm not sure this could actually be achieved but patient conscious surgery of the brain seems to initiate real reactions to absent stimuli but there is still stimuli in the fact that parts of the brain are being activated by the surgeon. So it's not a complete blind alleyway.\n\nI suppose what I'm considering is the chain of mechanisms are real but the post mechanism of thought or reaction is deceptive or can be deceptive. Can thoughts and observations run in smooth parallel? Can post mechanisms be depended on for accurate portrayals of the mechanisms that feed it? I think post mechnisms are quite incomplete in that they have to make references to memory as context whereas actual mechansims of observation do not. It is possible to say \"I am hungry\" and actually be hungry. I don't have a problem with that.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1677451003.0},{"author":null,"text":"Existence is boring and humans are the only thing that make it interesting.","upvotes":-1,"created_utc":1673891925.0},{"author":null,"text":"Subject can\u2019t be the object brah","upvotes":0,"created_utc":1673893230.0},{"author":"Ed-Geingsta","text":"None of this real electrons do not exist as soon as you reorient your focus the wave function of whatever you were observing collapsed","upvotes":0,"created_utc":1673902054.0},{"author":"Iridium777","text":"I'm not going to sit through the video, but Donald Hoffman's view on this has me nauseated.

Or eternal states of existence not being subjected to the relentless march of time and change. Within the finite confines of our mortal lives, experiencing both the  beginnings and endings of things as well as the deterioration of our own bodies with age, we may simply lack the capacity to grasp the infinity while being subjected to causality and determinism. Permanency seems fleeting as we look for those things of lasting value giving meaning to a world of constant change. Change itself then becomes the only constant we can rely on with certainty, trying to direct the course of that change the best we can given the limitations and resources we may have.\n\nSo that said, let me tell you about Heraclitus' Fire and the Eternal Universe!\n\nHeraclitus  was an ancient Greek pre-Socratic philosopher who lived during the late 5th and early 4th Century BC in Ephesus, a city in the Persian Empire  that is now Turkey. He is perhaps best known for his views on the  persistence of change, having declared \"The only permanence is change\"  along with \"No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the  same river and he's not the same man\". But how Heraclitus perceived that  change, and the nature of it, becomes shockingly relevant to even  modern physics, quantum mechanics and cosmology which I will try to  summarize:\n\nFirst, Heraclitus  believed in an eternal universe without cause or beginning, existing  instead in a state of perpetual change caused by the interactions  between matter and fire. That these two substances were actually the  same substance transforming back and forth from one state to the next.  And this constant flux was the engine which drove the Universe forward,  changing from one state to the next like the constant flux and motion of  an eternal flame. A universal fire within all matter that gave it the  capacity for change, existing in a dynamic rather than static condition  capable of becoming the many substances and materials not only occurring  on the Earth but anywhere across the Universe.\n\nWhy  fire? During Heraclitus' time the Universe was said to be comprised of  four main primordial elements: Earth, Water, Air and Fire. Thales  believed water was the primordial element in all things.  Anaximenes  believed it was air. But to Heraclitus only fire existed in a constant  flux of motion necessary to fuel the changes he saw occurring in all  things. The other primordial elements could exist in motionless states  without change leaving fire the only primordial element known to  Heraclitus capable of sustaining an eternal universe of perpetual  changes. Although not a direct quote by Heraclitus, the following  argument uses a typical ontology often seen in not only the  pre-Socratics but cosmological arguments throughout history to support  both logically and conceptually the eternal universe:\n\n\"If  nothing cannot create something, requiring a cause, then the cause must  necessarily be something rather than nothing itself. Something then  creating something would mean that nothing then ever was. And if nothing  ever was then something has always been. And something that has always  been requires no cause or beginning, instead existing in constant change  from one state to the next.\"\n\nPerhaps crude and simplistic, it nevertheless serves it's purpose in presenting a means in which to conceptualize, at least to myself, the infinity that an existence within causality makes difficult to comprehend. Such an eternal universe then resulting from the end of causality itself somewhat paradoxically. If nothing cannot create something itself, then any cause in such creation could not be itself nothing resulting in the  absurd proposition of \"Nothing created something out of nothing\". Something then creating something would have to be capable of interacting with and sharing the same substantive properties of it's creation. Imagine smoke trying to pick up a glass of water. Or oxygen trying to wear clothes. A ghost walking through walls...\n\nSuch problems of interaction plagued Descartes regarding his substance dualism proposing an immaterial mind and a material body. Initially he posited the mind completely separate from the body and essentially being irrelevant to the body for it's existence. Pure idealism. But as he encountered refutations in his arguments regarding the problems of interaction he finally had to concede a material solution to such problems in the proposal of the Pineal Gland at the center of the brain being the necessary interface where an immaterial mind could interact with a material body, sending and receiving information sharing some common physical properties.\n\nBut it was an ad-hoc solution to support a failed proposition anyway. Today the Pineal Gland is removed entirely when it becomes cancerous in a procedure called a Pinealectomy without loss of communication between the \"immaterial\" mind with the material body. The problem of interaction remains and substance dualism has been largely repudiated today.\n\nSo the distinction here between \"nothing\" and \"something\" could also be  analogous to the \"Atom and Void\" referred to by Democritus and the early  Atomist Philosophers. It was Democritus who first called the smallest  piece of something the \"Atomos\", meaning \"uncuttable\" in Greek. And he  arrived at the Atomos using a remarkable line of deductive reasoning  leading to it's necessary existence:\n\nIf  you take something and cut it in half, then keep cutting the halves in  half, eventually you arrive at a particle that, if cut, you would no  longer have the something you began with.\n\nDemocritus  called that particle \"Atomos\" which is where we derived the word \"Atom\"  from. The atom then being the pixels of our reality, the fundamental  particles which comprise all things instead of the original primordial  elements of earth, water, air and fire. But Heraclitus' fire, or rather  it's properties of flux and motion giving the characteristics of change  to all matter, got a major update in the early 20th Century when  Einstein explained instead the relationship between matter and energy,  expressed mathematically as E=Mc2. That within the atoms that comprised  the material universe itself lied the energy that Heraclitus could only  conceive as fire which provided the catalyst for the perpetual changes  happening in all things within an eternal universe.\n\nIndeed  it is the polarization of subatomic particles within the atoms which  create the positive or negative charges that attract or repel other  atoms allowing the formation of more complex and denser materials,  becoming the many molecules which form the basis of life itself. Like  water. Two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom can combine to form a  single water molecule. Six water molecules form to become the property  of wetness. Still further molecules allow the emergent properties of  water to continue manifesting themselves, like cohesion within a drop  from surface tension and adhesion to surfaces, temperature regulation,  and even the floating property of ice. Enough water molecules combined  allows water to become a solvent, capable of forming it's own hydrogen  bonds.\n\nWater then is an excellent  example of the capacity of atoms to recombine into many substances,  using the energy contained therein to facilitate the changes necessary  for the atoms to merge, or separate, into new molecules or greater  quantities of them, like the two hydrogen and one oxygen atoms that bond  through static charge forming a single water molecule.\n\nSo  Heraclitus' Fire became Einstein's Energy. The universal substance or  property in all matter allowing for changes to happen. And if E=Mc2  wasn't clear enough in describing this relationship between the atoms  and energy, perhaps the splitting of the Uranium-235 atom during nuclear  fission and the subsequent release of energy within a critical mass  resulting in an atomic explosion is more convincing!","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1673990894.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s View of Metaethics and Normative Ethics","author":"ADefiniteDescription","url":"https:\/\/blog.apaonline.org\/2021\/01\/18\/martin-luther-king-jr-s-view-of-metaethics-and-normative-ethics\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1673890370.0,"comments":[{"author":"doodcool612","text":"Was anyone able to find the linked article \u201cWhat Euthyphro Should Have Said\u201d?

As a result it is a bit too long, sorry \ud83d\ude2c\n\n**Supertasks by VSauce**\n\nhttps:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=ffUnNaQTfZE\n\nThis is a good video by VSauce on supertasks. Fun, informative, accurate; just watch it!\n\nI'm posting this because I think it shines a light on an area of philosophy which I think is seriously flawed: metaphysics (downvotes incoming!). My problem with metaphysics is that it tries to reach conclusions about what exists which are too strong using \"armchair\" reasoning, when this should be better left to scientists, especially physicists. While philosophy does utilise cold hard logic sometimes, especially to construct paradoxes to establish what **isn't** true, it often also requires other approaches to arrive at conclusions about what **is** true, such as coming up with different theories which fit, valuing parsimony, etc. But when it comes to establishing what exists, it's the scientists who should be left to come up with theories that fit, utilise parsimony as they see fit, do experiments to narrow things down, etc., and yes they can also be trusted with the cold hard logic when it comes up. They get to decide when a question is more concretely answered vs. when there isn't sufficient information and so there are only hypotheses.\n\nSo how does this relate to Michael's video on Supertasks? Supertasks originated as thought experiments, specifically paradoxes, thought up by philosophers. The two most famous are Zeno's paradox and Thomson's lamp. Michael explains the correct answer to both, which was stated firmly by Paul Benacerraf back in 1962: all these supertask thought experiments ultimately come down to a lack of information (like one of those logic puzzles where one of the options is \"not enough information\"). So they aren't really paradoxes at all and don't tell us anything about reality.\n\nThat doesn't mean that these thought experiments are useless. They should be better thought of as puzzles, which tell us something about reasoning, and open interest into what physicists may one day discover, or what mathematics might apply. Often puzzles have been the foundation on which beautiful and interesting maths is built. Indeed, it feels like metaphysicians are often pulling interesting ideas which belong in maths or physics into their department, because while they aren't qualified to tackle them properly they still need to publish papers.\n\nNow, for some philosophers like Alexander Pruss this isn't enough: they want to use these thought experiments to reach conclusions about what exists. In Pruss's book 'Infinity, Causation, and Paradox' (2018) he uses supertasks and other reasoning to try and argue for his position of causal finitism, which roughly implies that none of these paradoxes could ever come about in reality.\n\nBut this is just not necessary and an overreach of philosophy. Let's take the example of the green and yellow cube at timestamp 10:57 in the video. If a cube like this did exist in reality, yes it's true that the colouring algorithm does not tell us the colour of the top. But maybe physicians would find out that the top colour must always be green, or always yellow, or always a quantum superposition of the two. All answers fit because the supposed paradox isn't a paradox: the colouring algorithm doesn't give enough information to determine what the top colour is. So the thought experiment is interesting and opens up questions about reality, but can never answer them. Zeno's paradox is much the same: all it tells us it that physicists must determine how motion works; maybe because motion is continuous (so the limit of the partial sums gives the answer, as expected), maybe because space is not infinitely divisible, or something else.\n\nI've only been talking about a small slice of metaphysics, but it is my personal opinion that this a microcosm which correctly shows the sub-discipline's flaws (I can feel the downvotes running through my veins \u2744\ufe0f). This is of course my personal opinion, and seeing as I'm posting it anonymously on Reddit it's worth pretty much nothing, but I thought I'd voice it here anyway to give a little balance to this subreddit.\n\nIf you actually read this far, well done!

It can be seen as an abstract relationship between a possession and a proprietor enforced by a law or consensus.  \n\nNot being an action means that an ownership isn't production. Goods and services are exclusively produced, excluding some very rare cases of natural goods like atmospheric oxygen. Human responsibility in production will be limited to the role of one's own personal human capital, such as his time availability, experience, acquired knowledge, skills, mental and physical capabilities, etc. Humans will thus not be responsible for automated production, for example, even if the owner of the automate is his producer. In essence, the producer isn't what he produces and can't claim responsibility of the role of what he produces in production.\n\nWe can thus say that wealth compensations can't be given for ownerships of any kind other than personal human capital.\nSince production for which humans are responsible for is limited, any such compensation will cause a reduction of the pool of wealth.

Or, we used \"OR\" (p \u2228 q \u2228 r) to assert that at least one of the three concepts is true at the same time.\r  \n\r  \nWe also discussed the logical contradiction of stating that the opposite of non-binary is a binary concept, which creates a paradox. This can be represented in propositional calculus using the statement p \u2227 \u00acp where p is a propositional variable that represents the concept of non-binary and \u00acp represents the concept of binary. And also, we used p => \u00acq where p is propositional variable that represents the concept of non-binary and \u00acq represents the concept of binary.

That is to say, your knowledge of your native language exceeds the sum of the language you've heard. Your capacity to acquire a language also diminishes over time. By the time you've reached adulthood, the critical period for acquiring a language has passed and you're stuck with what you've got\\*.\n\nThere's also a whole lot we don't know, such as why it's almost impossible to learn a second langauge with native-like proficiency later in life given first language acquisition is effortless. Second language learners can reach a point in learning where no amount of effort or immersion in the target culture will help fix the errors that remain in their understanding of the second language, and we don't know why this happens.\n\nLanguage acquisition probably has more in common with learning to walk than it does with learning to ride a bike, that is to say it's innate and somehow you know when you're ready to do it, even before you're old enough to know how to not shit your pants. So, discussions of what it means to \"know\" a language need to differentiate between the processes of language acquisition and language learning, and be clear-eyed about how bad we are at the latter even though we're miraculously talented at the former.\n\n\\*To clarify this point, because a lot of people took issue with it, I don't mean you can never learn another language, only that the process of learning a language in adulthood will be different to the process of acquiring a language (or multiple languages) in early childhood.

However, what exactly is wrong with making errors in the target language?  Consider conversely this, is there actually a need for someone to arguably overlearn a language to a point (like many of us here) that we not only take for granted, but possibly entrap ourselves within a sociolinguistic framework?\n\nThe idea that we cannot learn a second language past 2x can be disproven, if there is evidence for it - there is no law here.  More importantly, as that is not an interesting question - why might it be the case that we can't?  To be frank, it might just be because you are telling yourself the lie that you couldn't, because of the investment you've made in your native language.\n\n\"Errors\" in a second language are arguably not always such a bad thing - yes, communication is important but does overlearning one language prevent us from making more progress in others?  Also, if we stop considering errors to be a bad thing, then we face the potential reality that novelty is present everywhere in second-language learning, but when speaking your native language the experience of novelty (in relation to the language) is nigh inexperienced.  Except, in many cases, when someone speaks \"improperly\" or wrongly.\n\nWe cannot as a culture distinguish ourselves from the desire for everyone to be like us, and\/or for ourselves to be like everyone.

In Section 3 I attempt to strengthen substantially the case for late Lockean absolutism by appeal to his private 1697\u201398 correspondence with Van Limborch, arguing that the demonstrations he there offers for the unicity of God presuppose a strongly absolutist conception of \u2018pure space\u2019 (as he calls it).

Yet critics argue all such codes are mistaken attempts to reduce life to a set of ideals, and are doomed to failure. \n\nThis debate explores whether having rules to live by is useful and desirable, or oppressive and ineffective. \n\nSophie-Grace Chappell argues while life can\u2019t be reduced to a rule book, rules are often a useful way of navigating the complexities of life. In particular, argues Chappell, we can use moral rules to  help us develop the virtues. \n\nMassimo Pigliucci concurs that we cannot condense how to live into a rule book, but argues that rules are more detrimental than helpful. The rigidity of rules renders them unhelpful in navigating human existence.

It would be helpful if people saw such a distinction not as a binary, sober apprehension of reality-as-is, but as a transfer of personal importance and value from one interpretation to another. Believing that you view reality \"for what it really is\" is the conceit of the college sophomore who has returned home for the summer. \n\nAnd if all of these things are merely interpretations of reality, what good does your interpretation do you? Does it bring joy? Why are the joyous mocked as being naive?

It's a positive thing.\n\nI imagine a world with meaning as a horrifying concept.  Objective truths and absolute values placed on things in some divine fashion.\n\nThe life of a child has no inherent value.  A disease will kill them just as easily as anyone else.  A fire will kill them just as easily as anyone else.  \n\nHowever, we place meaning on it. We see a child dying of disease as a terrible thing, and so we take that meaning and act on it.  It is possible for there to be people out there who don't find value in a child's life, because it's not an objective thing... And those differences in what we find value in are important for the society we choose to have.  \n\nOur sun has no inherent meaning.  It's just what happens when the right elements in large enough numbers are placed under enough gravity and time.  It's an inevitable consequence of the universe and nothing special.\n\nHowever we place meaning on it.  Entire religions form around the Sun, the day night cycle is the heartbeat of our society, we recognize that it is foundational to life on Earth.  None of that has meaning, but it has meaning to individuals which is what matters.\n\nThe idea of a universe where specific things have objective meaning is horrible.  As an easy example, if a religion was objectively true what would be the purpose of life?  If there was an objective truth that the meaning of life was to follow a set of rules some God laid out, and we knew that they were true in the sense that gravity is true and magnetism is true.  In that world, You would have to be an absolute lunatic to do anything that didn't advance your chances at eternity. You think this meager 100 years matters? You think your family matters? Your art?  Your dog?

Denying this isn't nihilism or no meaning, its confronting an incoherent question with a coherent one.\n\nDenying there is no favourite food without a person that has food preferences is not the same as saying there are no favourite foods.

Human nature exists with or without God, and no matter how hard we conceive ourselves as something different, we can never escape our humanness.

Within a Nihilistic framework, there is no reason to believe this is the case. Are insects and trees free to define their essence as well? The fact that we are conscious and intelligent lends us no special freedom from nature that these other life forms do not possess.\n\nUltimately, Existentialism and Absurdism are just expressions of Humanism, which is itself a remnant of the anthropocentric principle in Christianity.

As far as we can tell we have absolutely no impact on anything beyond our planet. As the trilogy in four parts puts it we are a spec on a spec on a spec on a spec or something like that. \n\nBasically, compared to the universe our galaxy cluster is just a tiny spec. Compared to our cluster our galaxy is just a tiny spec. Compared to galaxy the sun is just a tiny spec. Compared to the sun the earth is just a tiny spec. Compared to the earth each of us is just a tiny spec. \n\nYet for all those levels of insignificance, we exist anyway. We run around, living lives, having ideas, dreaming, wondering, fighting and all the rest. We have concepts and worries and experiences that in all that wide universe exist nowhere else (that we can tell).  we can appreciate things, we can observe and have the ability to ponder the universe and our place in it. We might exist for a mere moment in the timeline of the universe and be so small and insignificant to it all, and that makes it so exciting to be a part of it. \n\nWe're an explosion of thought and experience and emotion that accounts for the entirety of those things in the whole universe. That's exciting and marvellous by its own right. \n\nI'm not sure I would go as far as to say we are the universe's attempt to contemplate its own existence but I understand where the argument comes from. \n\nI guess that makes me an existentialist?","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1671161635.0},{"author":"phroztbyt3","text":"This post made me join this sub \ud83d\ude06 \n\nI'm an existential optimist.
