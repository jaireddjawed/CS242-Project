        "text": "I just re-watched this one last night and it’s just a fantastic film.  Great, believable characters, impressive acting throughout, and a phenomenal score/soundtrack.  Some of the best moments between characters I can remember.\n\nA couple of my favorites are Alan Arkin’s character when he tells Greg Kinnear he’s proud of him.  It comes across as so sincere, especially because he made that character feel so real with the tough, blunt, NYC old guy attitude.  You know he doesn’t bother saying things unless he means them- good or bad,\n\nAnother is Toni Collette telling the young girl that her grandpa is dead.  I’ve never been a parent and never will, but her performance at the hospital is haunting in its grace.  The whole cast just does a great job, from Steve Carrell playing a man almost completely devoid of hope, to Paul Dano being frustrated with his family, all the way to the doctor who breaks it to the family that their grandfather is dead.  Abigail Breslin does a fantastic job being naive and full of joy, including the part at the end where she bravely decides to do her rehearsed dance scene after much trepidation from her brother and father.\n\nProbably the funniest scenes in my opinion are when they get pulled over, and the horn goes on the fritz.  I can’t tell you how hard I laughed at that, because the horn itself just has this mocking and absurd sound, which totally undercuts the sincerity of the actors.  Dean Norris goes from understanding to a bit disgusted right away, and Bryan Cranston plays his character in a way that you never really know if he actually believed in Kinnear’s book idea or if he’s just taking advantage of him.\n\nThe last scene I truly enjoyed the most, because you realize that dance is the grandfather’s way of trolling pageants, even though he wasn’t there to see it.  Having a 6-year old dance to “Super freak” points out just how fucking creepy those things are, and it’s the chef’s kiss of satire.  The audience member who gives a standing ovation the end was just a cherry on top of the over-sexualized mocking of pageant culture.  \n\nKudos to everyone involved in making this movie.  It’s not a light movie in many ways, but the way they deal with such difficult moments is very human.",

Two completely different characters and very deftly played. \n\nNote I said Performance(s) because you can name two or three roles if they were close to their death and some actors have had multiple films released posthumously and died more suddenly, so were still in pretty good shape to be able to continue taking multiple roles before their deaths filmed in the year or so before their death.",

        "text": " Question, Why did Hollywood hate Orson Welles?\n\nIt seemed that after Citizen Kane, Orson Welles really took Hollywood by storm and Citizen Kane is probably his masterpiece and really changed the way Movies were made and was really patient zero for The Auteur Theory. But I also think Citizen Kane was also Welle's greatest folly. I think Hollywood felt intimidated by Welles because of Citizen Kane and Welles really became public enemy #1 with the only person that could ruined anyone in the U.S, William Randolph Hearst.\n\nAfter Citizen Kane, Welles lost control of The Magnificent Ambersons and was butchered and 40 Minutes of the film was cut. The Stranger was one of few films that Welles made that had little interference. The Lady from Shanghai had lots of Studio Interference. His Macbeth was truncated. His Othello had 3 different versions. Touch Of Evil has Studio Interference. The Trial, Chimes At Midnight, and F for Fake were along with Citizen Kane and The Stranger were the chosen few that Welles had complete control over.\n\nNot only that Orson Welles had a lot of Projects that were unfinished (Don Quixote, The Deep, The Merchant of Venice). and Films he wanted to make (Heart Of Darkness, Santa, The Life Of Christ, Moby Dick, Around The World In 80 Days) exc. as Welles couldn't find funding or he couldn't finish them. Although one film, The Other Side Of The Wind was finish and released on Netflix.\n\nDo you think Hollywood hated Orson Welles?",

Fantasy Comedy is becoming more and more popular but doesn’t have a dedicated space for discussion and recommendation.\n\nSo I made r/FantasyComedy\n\nCome join if you, too, are a fan of this sub-genre, and would like to discuss and give/receive recommendations for funny and fantastical movies, TV shows and books. It’s a place to chat about speculative fiction which makes us laugh.

I am curious how people come to their opinions.\n\n-\n\nDo people have some evaluation process? Or is it just a gut opinion? Like I am hearing a lot of people call Cate Blanchett's performance as one of the best acting performances in years, the best of her career. But how did people come to the decision that her performance here is better than lets say Frances McDormand in Nomdland, or her own performance in Blue Jasmine?\n\n-\n\nHow are people chosing between Angela Bassett and Kerry Condon? They both completely sell their roles. Its hard for me to say one played their role better than the other, because both hand me completely buying performances. Is it the difficulty of performance? Transformation? If so how do you know which performance is more difficult than the next? Who transformed more between the two?\n\n-\n\nAnd this is evaluating two people with similar dramatic roles(I know Banshees is technically a comedy but her role was more dramatic than comedic imo). How do you compare that to Jamie Lee Curtis and Stephanie Hsu whose performances had huge physical and comedic components?",

Me and my wife went to the screening of E.T last night. \n\nSo it was meant to be original English audio with Portuguese subtitles. And for maybe 20 minutes all was well...\n\nAt a point the subtitles stopped. Then when they came back they kept going from where they had stopped, about 5 minutes behind the film. This was already funny enough but then the audio track started to lag behind the video.\nJust slightly at first but slowly it kept getting more out of sync.\nAt this point we had video, then audio a second later, then the appropriate subtitles 5 minutes later!! Then the subtitles changed to French!! \n\nBut wait there's more!!!\n\nThe film stops and someone tells us they're trying to fix it.\n\nThey rewind 20 minutes and away we go. WITH FRENCH AUDIO.\nThe audience reaction was up until this point mixed. Understandably parents who brought kids were annoyed, and people who couldn't understand English were just confused without knowing what was happening. All the while us and a number of others were having the time of our damn lives and guffawing loudly.\nBut at the French language portion of the film we all about got the joke.\n\nThe English audio returned in normal sync with subtitles stuck 5 mins behind still.\nThis continues for a few minutes and the lights come up and the film shuts off. The cinema literally gave up on successfully showing us E.T. today.\n\nAs an extra delightful detail... The film was being played on VLC player! At one point the film was in a small window being dragged around the screen, little Elliots face zooming around like an old DVD screensaver.\n\nWe went into the film thinking we'd end up in tears. We didn't expect them to be of laughter.\nMagical. Thank you Spielberg!",

A stranger starts living in their house and they act remarkably casual about it as if he isn't even there (except Bullock of course). \n\nThere is no relationship building in this movie except for the one way love from Bullock towards Michael. The closest they come to building a relationship with the sister (Lily Collins) is that she sits on a desk with him to study in silence at school, and starts fist bumping him and calling him \"bro\". All while Michael seems to give no cares in the world because he can only do one expression. \n\nThe pacing is terrible. In the first hour you get the whole \"charitable rich white woman saves minority from a ghetto\", and once that's over and he suddenly becomes good at football after a contrived speech from Bullock we get to see which school he plans to go to, which nobody in the world, not even Michael seems to really care for.\n\nBUT WAIT! Someone from the NCAA tells Michael that they are worried that now white people will start adopting black kids so they go to their preferred school. Michael gets so pissed at the writers for this preposterous suggestion that he decides he can't be part of this movie anymore so he runs away for a little bit. \n\nSandra Bullock made a pretty low quality movie seem good. Even if the academy likes \"white savior\" movies I don't think they would have touched this movie with a 10 foot pole if it wasn't for her. Without her this movie falls apart.",
