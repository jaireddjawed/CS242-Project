I’m not worried about their first language, but they hardly seem to pick up the second language, compared to other kids of bicultural families around us.

Others try to talk to you in German but again, most sentences are full of mistakes and they lack the vocabulary to actually keep up a conversation with natives, even if they (I) try to keep it simple. \n\nNow, on one hand I’ve often heard that trying to speak a foreign language is crucial to getting used to it and thus getting fluent, but on the other hand I feel like in doing so, these people are practicing wrong structures, and I’ve heard many times (and find it accurate anectodally) that getting rid of bad habits is harder than getting it right directly.\n\nWhat I usually do in the former case (paragraph littered with mistakes) is to just tell the creator that there are many mistakes in the text and point them to the areas of grammar they need to read up on, as I am not even sure correcting the text would be of any use at this stage. I don’t really know what to do in the latter case (people trying to converse with you even though they’re clearly not ready and are making mistakes left and right). \n\nIs there any sort of consensus as to whether:\n\n1. The above behaviors should be encouraged or discouraged, and\n\n2. What to do as a native speaker and/or mentor in such a situation?",

While it’s impossible to predict which questions will generate disscussion all of the time, here are some examples: \n\n*Quick questions:*\n\n* Asking for an explanation of a technical term\n* Asking if there are any languages with a particular feature\n* Asking how we would transcribe something\n* Asking how a feature works in a particular language\n\n*Not-so-quick questions:*\n\n* Asking about the theoretical or methodological motivation for a particular claim\n* Asking for reading recommendations for a particular subject\n\nIf you’re not sure where your question belongs, just use your best judgment. The mods might ask you to move your question—but if so, it’s no big deal, and has nothing to do with the quality of the question.\n\nAlso, before asking a question, please be sure to check [**our FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/faqindex) and to do a quick Google or Wikipedia search. We’re happy to answer questions, but we appreciate it when people have tried to do some basic research first.

This could be because you posted it soon before the new Q&amp;A thread went up, or it could be because it the answer requires specialist knowledge.  If this happens, feel free to repost your question in the new Q&amp;A thread, or to post it as a separate thread.",

        "text": "Hi there r/linguistics.\n\nYou know where I'm going with this based on the title. I'll give you some brief context: I'm an undergraduate student studying linguistics in ex-Yugoslavia. I'm an American, but managed to learn enough Serbo-Croatian to get through my studies and things are going well. This style of learning suits me, because I'm getting a decent education while getting to push myself in language-learning and testing my skills at immersing myself in other cultures and languages.\n\nI want to be a field linguist. It's always been a dream of mine, and I'm really certain about it. I'd like to work in Africa. What brought me to the Balkans was my girlfriend, and now that I'm very comfortable living in her region, I'd like to begin preparing to work in Africa. It occurred to me that I could begin studying French or Arabic and perhaps do my graduate studies at an African university, like one in Egypt. I heard that Al-Azhar offers a Ph.D program in linguistics.\n\nThe international rankings of most of these universities are a little iffy, but as long as the quality of education is good, I don't see that as a great downside. I think living in Africa and getting good at French/Arabic would do me more good than studying linguistics at a prestigious university in the U.S. or Europe, given what I want to do.\n\nSo what do you all think? Am I on the right track here, or is this line of thinking a waste of time? Is studying linguistics in Egypt, for example, such a crazy idea? (That's assuming I learn enough Arabic in time) \n\nI need to start thinking of how to make money with my studies as well, and frankly I don't know how field linguistics is supposed to pay the bills. Otherwise I'm just going off on field trips to exotic places without the ability to pay for them. I'm pretty young and not very experienced with this, so I'd love to hear the thoughts of you guys here. I'd be very grateful. Thanks very much.",

It seems like there are a decent number of languages (of varying levels of attestation) which we know must have been IE languages but aren't placeable within the above framework.\n\nThe mail ones that I can think of are Illyrian, Dacian, Thracian, Lusitanian, possibly the languages of the Nordwest Block cultures (Elps and Hilversum) and even potentially \"Old European\" which is unattested but can be seen in some geographic names. \n\nOn top of that, there's the issue of languages we have no way to detect at all. Slavic (and I suppose Baltic), a language group that covers roughly half of Europe now, seems to have appeared from nowhere very late in history, compared to the other IE languages. It would seem to me that Proto Slavic could have had tons of regional cousins that are simply lost to time.\n\nAre there any estimates for how many branches of IE actually developed if you include missing or unidentifiable languages? Or likely-but-unconfirmed branches? Unclassified IE languages I've forgotten about in this list?",

Ideally if anyone has any suggestions for texts, languages, or even wants to ship me a book they don't need in a non-Latin language, I'd greatly appreciate it.\n\n\\~Theodore",

(Only around 20% of ethnic Circassians speak the language.)\n\nFor the past several years, I've been compiling notes from primary sources and field efforts, and I have a pretty good overview of the language. \n\nI'm in the final stages of cleaning everything up, and I'm struggling with how best to format / convey all of this information. \n\nI'm also struggling with how deep to go into detail.\n\nMy work product is a bit more than a grammatical overview, but a bit less than a raw text book. \n\nIt's designed to explain how the language is structured, why it does some of the (crazy) things it does, and provide examples.\n\nIn my mind, it's kind of a Language Primer: It's a great introduction to the language. \n\nIf you're 100% new to the language, it explains what to expect if / when you start to learn. If you're already learning, it's a great reference manual to explain things, and if you're a teacher, it's a great overview about how to guide students through the language. \n\nMy question here: Can anyone point me towards a good example (in any language) or a published book that comes kind of close to what I am trying to do?\n\nI'm just looking for a best-practice example to help clarify some issues in my mind about what my own final work product should look like. \n\nThanks, in advance.",

        "text": "Hello, r/linguistics! I'm currently talking to a professor at my local university about some research opportunities and I want to further my knowledge about African American English, eventually researching it as it pertains to education, particularly the impact of dual-language or ESL programs in closing the racial achievement gap. Another research opportunity would be to examine teacher behaviors, such as correcting students on their speech, and how they influence that achievement gap. \n\nMy first question is: Are there opportunities for study here? I'm aware that dual-language programs were studied once by Thomas and Collier, but that's the only study I can find. As for teacher behavior, I know there has been more research in that area.\n\nWith that in mind, I want to learn about a few things: \n\n*  A very basic general linguistic theory so that I can understand what's happening while I'm reading things. \n* The history of AAE and AAVE. \n* The education gap as it relates to AAE. \n* Any studies relating to education and AAE, especially those that offer solutions. \n* The negative influence of stigmatization of a dialect, again, especially in a classroom setting.\n\nAny recommendations on the topic would be helpful. Right now, I've read only a few articles, all of which are produced for popular audiences, so they haven't delved thoroughly into the issue. Beyond that, I've looked at the 2012 Thomas and Collier study on dual-language education with its impacts on black students. This is the only work I've been able to find that statistically looks at Dual-Language programs. I've also read Reynolds' *The Influence of Dual Language Education Upon the Development of English Reading Skills of Kindergarten Through Grade Two Students*, but that focused primarily on white and Latino students.\n\nThank you!",
