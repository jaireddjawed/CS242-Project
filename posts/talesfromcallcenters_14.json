        "text": "Apologies for any awkward formatting, I’m on mobile. \n\nSo I used to work at a mostly inbound call centre for a car club in the U.K. We used to get frequent calls from customers that had forgotten things in the cars and only realised after they’d locked up &amp; ended their booking. \n\nThe way the system worked is that you had a membership card to let you in, and a PIN number to access the computer to release the keys, and you did the same process in reverse to end your reservation; so nobody could get back into the car once it was locked with the membership card. \n\nSo anyway one fine afternoon I take a call from a gentleman who’d forgotten “something.” No problem, I sent a signal through to the central locking to open it back up again. He retrieves his things and we’re good.\n\nOnly, before ending the call he tells me, “Oh thanks for that! My grandma will be pleased. I accidentally locked her in!” \n\nMy dude. You did not forget something in there, you forgot an ENTIRE PERSON. (I wish my actual response had been that good but it was mostly spluttering and laughing. He was cool and laughing too.) \n\nOh man, the tales I have from working the phones there. ",

        "text": "I work for an insurance company.  I do not take inbound calls unless someone calls me directly, but still work closely with our customer service reps, and make outbound calls often.  I have a customer we will call Sam.  Sam is a douche canoe (in my opinion).  He’s the kind of customer who is unhappy with the company before he ever even initiated contact with us, and he acts accordingly.  He yells and he insults and he’s just not the kind of person you’d gravitate to at a party, probably.  I’m familiar with Sam and his antics, as I speak with him roughly once per week for things that he could easily handle but chooses not to (things like our fax number, his claim number, if we have received additional information, etc).  \n\nWell, Sam today called into customer service and said the CSR is a “fucking bitch who can just fuck right off” because she said she needed to look up his information in order to help him today (how DARE she not be able to read his mind, you know!).\n\nI reached out to the CSR and apologized to her on behalf of Sam, because even though he’s not sorry for his behavior, I’m still sorry that she had to speak with him.  I ended up asking a manager to call Sam and figure out what his deal is, because he’s not capable of having a normal conversation with anyone else. The outcome was that he wanted to know information easily accessible from the website.  \n\nRegarding problematic customers - We read previous call notes.  We can tell what a jackass you were to the last person you spoke with.  We can tell how short your fuse is almost from the get-go, and mentally buckle in accordingly.  There’s absolutely no way that every single person you speak to at this company is a douche canoe, and you are the victim. You’re just an oversized crybaby with an entitlement complex and an inability to discuss your feelings without cutting someone else down in the process.  ",

However, as I review her return/exchange I see that the store of origin made a pretty bad mistake. They placed an UNINSTALL service on the order which sends it to the wrong team. This pushes the date out as it is third party and we are left to their whims (and boy do they know it). So, I call the store and speak with this girl. I explain what happened and what needs to happen. They must remake the order and leave off the UNINSTALL service and place a non-regulated gas install on the order so that our basic delivery team will install everything. \n\nGirl: So, there is now going to be three ranges for this client?\n\nMe: Three? I don't follow you.\n\nGirl: Well, there is the one in their home that does not work. Then there is this exchange which is sending out another, and now you're having me make a new order.\n\nMe: (blink blink) No, no. The one at their home is being replaced with the exchange. And we are about to cancel this bad order and make a new good order. It will all work out.\n\nGirl: Hang on let me as my friend here. (She does not mute the phone so I hear): Hey can you talk to this guy? I am very confused and he is not explaining.\n\nMe: (blink, blink)\n\nGirl: (Gets back on the phone) Okay, we will take care of this. Tell me again what needs to be done.\n\nMe: Remake the order. Make sure you take off the UNINSTALL service or it will send it to the wrong team. Then make sure you put the non-regulated service on there. That will give us a much sooner date; which is what the client wants.\n\nGirl: Okay.\n\nShe sends me an email with a new order number on it that does not pull up in our system.  I then pull up the order I told them to remake and all they did was put a non-regulated service to the exchange. It is STILL set for the distance date. Nothing has changed as far as who is doing the work.\n\nI replied to her email with step by step by step instructions on how to re-make the order. I then called the store and made sure her department head watched her make it this time. \n\nMY OWN TEAM IS KILLING ME.... WHO TIES HER SHOES????? And she is IN the appliance department. If you're new...say so and I would have given the step by step by step much sooner to you and your friend that you had help.  ",

        "text": "So I work as a billing specialist/customer support representative for a company that does insurance coding/billing/EHR support for doctors offices and urgent cares. \n\nI got a call on Friday from a older woman who was at the end of her rope. The clinic had put her account on hold due to the balance on her account, so she couldn’t be seen for a visit or get refills until she paid her bill. She called in- incredibly angry, embarrassed, and on the verge of tears. She explained her situation, apologizing for being angry “because it’s not your fault”. \n\nNow, I’m a hard worker, if you’re nice to me, I’ll go to the ends of the earth to do anything I can for you. And so I looked at her account because she insisted that there’s no way she can owe a balance. She has 2 insurances. They’re great, they pay everything and she’s always paid her bills and compared them to her EOBs. I promise her that I’d review her entire account and call her back. It broke my heart when she asked if I’d really call. I promised I would.\n\n30 minutes later, I call her back. Im able to adjust half her balance due to timely filing issues, but it looks like she did owe one partial balance. She said she did pay it- we pull check numbers. She’s upbeat and very nice now. She’s thanked me for helping her, for calling her back, for spending so much time on her. \n\nAnother 10 minutes on the phone, some of it while old EOBs were loading, we discovered that an old rep enters an insurance payment as a deductible due by patient. I get excited when I see it because once it’s updated to her account she’s going to have a credit. She’s so excited when I tell her. She said no one ever took time to work with her before, that she was just some old woman that everyone got mad at when she called. She took my name and continued to thank me, saying she’d always ask for me from here on out.\n\nI checked her account today to see if my adjustment requests had been process to put the credit on her account yet (they hadn’t), but I see a long note from the office manager of the clinic in her account documenting how happy the woman was with her interaction with me. It brightened my day that she took the time to tell someone that we can do good things in the call center too. \n\nKeep your chin up everyone, all those nasty calls melt away when you get someone who truly appreciates you.\n",

I’m not a call center employee but a while back i had a really positive experience at a call center i wanted to share :-)\nMy luggage was lost by an airline company for about a week a while back and i called basically twice a day (morning and night) to the city it was probably left behind in and the city i landed in. Time after time i was rudely dismissed or sent on endless holds to different departments that didn’t always answer. I ended up on the phone with a random representative that was in a completely different department and honestly couldn’t really do anything at that point. We ended up having a really lovely conversation about our days and talked for like 20 minutes about our lives until he had to hang up. I know he couldn’t really help me, but that kindness i was shown is still something to this day i remember, it felt like he actually cared while everyone else was just playing pass the potato with my phone call. (Which i don’t blame them for, if they can’t solve my problem i would rather talk to someone who can, but i would just be stuck on the phone for over an hour just to be told the same thing).

        "text": "They beat me. Today was full of so many nasty, hateful callers, more then I've ever seen in the year I've worked here, and one finally got to me so much I ended the call in tears. It was mostly out of frustration and anger but it was embarrassing, I really pride myself in my composure in handling the type of calls we have that can escalate very quickly (accounting). This man was not really loud, but his tone and the way he treated me like an idiot really got to me.\n\n\n\nI hope it's not too confusing... It gets fairly complicated and long. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\n\n\nA is for Asshole.\n\n\n\nMe: How can I help you today?\n\n\n\nA: I have some invoices that are unpaid and I'd like to check on them. \n\n\n\nMe: *gathers some info, pulls up stuff he's asking about* So I see this person was paid for the dates you gave me in February on check XXX. \n\n\n\nA: Yeah for room X but he had two rooms. \n\n\n\nMe: I see you're faxing for room X repeatedly, we have paid for that one, we need the paperwork on the other room if that's the case.\n\n\n\nA: Well, it's a bit more complicated then that, because room X was my mistake. You paid on invoice X and in my system it actually shows as invoice Y. So the invoice number is wrong.\n\n\n\nMe: The invoice number is more for you then anything, as long as you know it's for (guest) on these dates in invoice Y, you can still use this payment to clear your books for this guest.\n\n\n\nA: *sigh* You don't understand, ma'am. I know you've paid for this room but I meant to put it under invoice Y and room Y, not invoice X and room X.\n\n\n\nMe: It is not conflicting with any other rooms on these dates, so it was still paid out successfully, and you know it's for him. I understand that the payment does not have the correct numbers, but the process to fix it involves me taking all of this money back under the wrong room and invoice and having you re-bill with the correct information and waiting for the company to pay again. It is not a problem for us so I recommend you use it to pay for his room since we know that's what it's for.\n\n\n\nA: *Ma'am,* it's not that hard. HE HAD TWO ROOMS.\n\n\n\nMe: All you've told me about and sent us a letter for is this room. What is the other room?\n\n\n\nA: On the 9th he had two rooms.\n\n\n\n\nMe: On the 9th we have room X and room Z. Room X is under John Smith and room Z is under room Smith, John. No room Y but we have paid for two rooms on the 9th. \n\n\n\nA: I KNOW but room Y is under room X and invoice X. I need it for room X and invoice Y. I've worked with your company for years, you can just take my word for it.\n\n\n\nMe: We have already paid for that room under invoice X. We will not pay for the same room twice on the same date under a different invoice number. I can go through the process to fix it if you need the numbers to match but as I said before it's a lot of hassle to get the same amount of money you already have.\n\n\n\nA: You don't understand. On the 9th that company had like 5 or 6 rooms and you never paid for room Y because I had to send it as room X.\n\n\n\nMe: Ok, now you're adding rooms, are we talking about 2 or 6?\n\n\n\nA: Oh my god. The company had 5 or 6 but HE. HAD. TWO. Do they just hire you people without any testing?\n\n\n\nI'm starting to shake a little as I do when I start getting really frustrated. This is when I should have put him on hold and taken a break but I was determined to figure this out.\n\n\n\nMe: And we've paid for 2 on the 9th. \n\n\n\nA: I *know that,* but not room Y.\n\n\n\nMe: YOU NEVER BILLED US FOR ROOM Y. Ever. You billed us for 2 rooms, one with the wrong number, and we paid. \n\n\n\nA: I KNOW YOU PAID FOR 2. YOU ARE NOT UNDERSTANDING ME. I NEED ROOM X ON INVOICE Y AND X FOR THE 9TH.\n\n\n\nMe: ?? Why? \n\n\n\nA: Like I have been trying to tell you, he was in room X on the 9th then he switched to room Y.\n\n\n\nMe: So he checked out and back in? If so maybe one date overlapped because he is in the wrong room with the wrong invoice on the 9th but on the 10th the invoice number is Y. So he stayed continuously on these dates and has been billed and paid accordingly.\n\n\n\nA: He moved from Y to X on the 9th because he wasn't happy with room Y, so when I faxed to get payment for the last night of room Y it had room X on it because that's the room he was in at checkout. But it had the right invoice number and you rejected it without even really looking at it.\n\n\n\nMe: But your letter said nothing about this, only that we owed for the WHOLE STAY, and we paid for the 9th on check X, you can see it right here online-\n\n\n\nA: Uh, yeah, I can see that. But he stayed until the afternoon in room Y then moved to X because the bed was wet and so I couldn't use that room for the 9th.\n\n\n\nMe: I see. If you are looking for compensation because he damaged the room and it was unavailable, that's an entirely different story. That would fall under an incidental charge and we will not pay for that. We will have to get you in contact with his company or the guest himself to see how they want to handle payment for that.\n\n\n\nA: You don't understand, ma'am! It's not an incidental charge or damages. He used the room and then changed in the afternoon and I couldn't sell it that night and we were full! It's a room charge!\n\n\n\nMe: We will only process ONE charge for EACH guest on any ONE date. If you need to be paid because for whatever reason the guest left the room unrentable, he is responsible and he will have to pay. I have to get you to the department that handles this account to help you reach them.\n\n\n\nA: No, this is your company and your employee, you have to pay and you don't get to pass me off to anyone else! It's just that simple and I expect this to be resolved today, I've wasted enough time trying to hold your hand and help you do your job.\n\n\n\nMe: It's not our company and not our employee. We are a THIRD PARTY. If you had been honest from the beginning you would have probably already spoken to the company about this. I also find it interesting now you only want one day when your letter said we owed for the WHOLE STAY, almost $900, and said nothing about this. \n\n\n\nA: Just give me the number to the company, I'm sick of explaining this to you.\n\n\n\nI transferred him to the right department and immediately burst into tears and shook pretty violently. My coworkers were all shocked and worried and my boss took me into another room to find out what had happened. I found out until I started crying no one even heard what I was saying! I thought I was practically yelling but they said I was quiet. I was just SO ANGRY at him for treating me like an idiot and even making me question myself at some points throughout the conversation, on top of being worn down by all of the other horrible callers. I understood everything, and caught him trying to steal extra money from us, that was his problem, not that I was stupid. My boss is an angel and told me next time to just give calls like that to her voicemail because she never wants to see us upset like that. She also bought us all shakes to make up for the awful day we all had. Some days are hard but I LOVE my coworkers and my boss.\n\n\nTL;DR: Scamming asshole tried to game our system, I caught him, he was disrespectful to me on an already bad day and I broke down, my boss and coworkers supported me and made me feel 100% better!",

They were both the \"flashlight.\" I'd never seen that before.\n\nI say \"this may sound silly, but I'd like to just check. Can you tell me if your iPhone's flashlight is on?\" \n\nCustomer: \"Yes, it's been on for the past couple of months. But I don't care about that anymore as I've gotten used to it. I just want my battery to last longer.\" \n\nMe: \"Ma'am, I believe we've discovered the cause of your short battery life. The flashlight is using up your battery.\" \n\nCustomer: \"Oh really?\"\n\nMe: Yes, let me help you turn it off. Please use your finger to swipe up from the very bottom. You will see a graphic menu. Please press the flashlight icon to turn the flashlight off.\"\n\nThe flashlight turned off.\n\nCan you believe this customer had her flashlight on for two months? Not only that, but she would always connect it to a charger before the iPhone could die. If it had died and she turned it back on, the flashlight would have turned off.\n\nThe customer had been using the iPhone blaring a light at everyone for TWO MONTHS!",

I know that's a bit late.\n\nCaller: My first appointment for my washer, they were 40 minutes late too. Did you know that?\n\nMe: No mam, I only have information about today's delivery. And the team just got hung up at a prior stop.\n\nCaller: That's not what they told me.\n\nMe: Oh? What did they tell you?\n\nCaller: They told me that the team was going to be late and that they did not know why.\n\nMe: I see. That is what they shared with me as well.\n\nCaller: You said they got hung up at a prior stop.\n\nMe: Yes, mam. That is the team being delayed. \n\nCaller: You said they were hung up.\n\nMe: Yes, mam. The delay is that they got hung up. I am sorry they used different words, but that is what happen. \n\nCaller: Well, 9PM is unacceptable. I want it here tomorrow morning.\n\nMe: I am very sorry mam, the routes for tomorrow have already been locked in. If someone 18 or older is not going to be present tonight we will need to reschedule once the truck has been checked in.\n\nCaller: Nope. Nope. Just cancel my order then. You guys suck. Just cancel it. I'm done.\n\nMe: Yes, mam. I understand you are looking to cancel. However, the order is out in the field right now. As a result the warehouse has your order in a locked status. I am not going to able to cancel until tomorrow.\n\nCaller: *rant of foul language and how crappy my company is* You better call me tomorrow to cancel. \n\nMe: Yes mam.  *Click*\n\n(Time goes by, I come in today -next day-and call her)\n\nMe: Alright mam, the truck has been checked in. Did you still want to cancel or would you be okay with delivery on 3/3?\n\nCaller: Just cancel it.\n\nMe: Yes mam, I will cancel your order and refund it to the method of purchase.\n\nCaller: (This is where the super DERP starts) How do you plan to do that?\n\nMe: I'm going to cancel the order in my sales system and then pull through our POS here to refund you.\n\nCaller: And what card are you going to put it on? (THIS IS A SET UP)\n\nMe: The card that was used to purchase the order mam.\n\nCaller:  Well...I used three cards to purchase this.\n\nMe: I see. Well, the refund will be divided up among the cards used according to how much was applied to them.\n\nCaller: And what does that mean?\n\nMe: *blink blink* Okay, if you used AMMX and put $100 on it and then used VISA and put $150 on it and then $300 on the last card...each card would get that much back to it.\n\nCaller: No. No. No, that's not how I want it done.\n\nMe: Mam, I do not get a choice. This is how it must be done.\n\nCaller: No. (Like I was a four year old). You will put *amount* on my AMMX and *amount* on my Visa. I do not want you to use *company name card*. (Because she wants to keep her points).\n\nMe: I'm very sorry mam. I do not get that option.\n\nCaller: You're being very rude. You're costing a sale for your company (she is canceling). I can't believe how you're talking to me.\n\nMe: I'm sorry mam, I'm just trying to explain to you. that I ***\n\nCaller: (Repeats how the money is be refunded)\n\nMe: I tell you what. I will call the store you purchased this from and see if they have different options. I cannot do what you're asking here at my location.\n\nCaller: I cannot believe this is taking this many phone calls just to get something cancelled. I told you last night to cancel it.\n\nMe: Yes, mam. I just wanted to give you the option of the 3/3 appointment.\n\nCaller: Yeah, well thanks (sarcastic), but it's crap. Cancel my order and put the money where I told you to put it.\n\nMe: I'm calling the store mam. I cannot do it here.\n\nCaller: Fine. Just do it. Hurry and call me I dont have time for this.\n\nMe: Yes mam. *disconnect- call store- explain*\n\nStore: We cannot do that. Since she is canceling only part of the order, the amount being refunded will be split evenly across all three cards.\n\nMe: She wants it done this way. I told her and she didn't want to hear it.\n\nStore: Well, I will process this here and call her. We will take care of this.\n\nMe: Thanks.\n\n-Fin. ",

Adamantium?)\nBut he needed it fixed today and was going to tell the shop to fix the part, but he would not pay anything. So he’s not going to let us look at the damage or confirm what coverage this should be (collision or manufacturer’s warranty). \n\nPlus - he sounded some flavor of arabic/western asian so a woman (me) telling him he was wrong probably didn't help, along with the cultural tendency to expect to negotiate a lot.

        "text": "Hello everyone! I have a story which I’m ashamed to share, but need to get this off my chest \n\nI work in a government call centre and deal specifically with helping people claim money back from the government for their medical expenses. As it’s a government call centre, it’s fair to say we can cop a fair amount of abuse from people who are unhappy- personally I think with the amount of funding we are given we are doing our very best, but I completely understand the frustration of the customers and do the best I can to help them. \n\nI’m generally a very patient and calm person, but unfortunately there are some awful things going on in my family- the main thing being the coming out of my biological father sexually abusing my little brother and sister (sorry if that is TMI). I only found out this weekend and haven’t handled the news well. I still tried to brave it out and go to work today (stupid idea I know). \n\nI had only been taking calls for 40 minutes when I received a call from a customer who was frustrated that a claim which was incorrectly processed. Fair enough- it’s a bit annoying but easy fixed. I was able to fix it quickly and let him know he should receive the benefit tomorrow. He then started berating me that this mistake happened in the first place, and as I tried to explain what had gone wrong he continued to talk over me and patronise me. Normally I can brush this stuff off but it got too me so bad today and said in a tone which was rather harsh and I said this louder than necessary “look, I have already explained this to you why this happened and I’ve fixed it for you” It’s not so much what I said but it was how I said it, the customer even muttered “woah” under his breath. \n\nI went to my TL after the call and burst in tears and explained what has been going on and she sent me home and recommended that I talk to someone. \n\nI just wanted to share this and get it off my chest- I’m so embarrassed I let a customer get to me :s\n\nEDIT: thank you so much for your comments and PMs of support- it’s really what I needed today. I’m going to be taking the week off to be with my brother and sister",

        "text": "First time poster - long time reader.  Thought I'd finally chime in with one that literally made me speechless.\n\nI work in the TV retention group for a pretty large US company.  This guy came on my line a few months ago and left me questioning many aspects of my life.  Mind you, I have been doing this job for about 7 years now.  I've heard it all, I've laughed, cried, and argued with customers...but this guy...\n\nMe: Good Morning!  My name is Mojo, how are you doing today?\n\nCustomer: I want to cancel my account.  The bill is too high and we are going to go to streaming.  My bill was supposed to be $60 a month and it's over $100.\n\n(noticing his account was only started about 8 months ago with a 2 year agreement - i won't lie, this makes me smile because 1 - they are usually easy saves and 2- if the call goes south, i get petty pleasure out of saying high dollar amount etfs.  He currently has a $250 amount due with almost $100 of that past due)\n\nI begin asking the questions, making small talk. Which leads to:\n\nMe:...I did some math and I noticed the reason your bill is no longer $60 is because of additional programming that was added.  Without the movie channels and the higher package, we can get you down to $60 again. Now, I didn't add in any late fees or rollover amounts from the recent billing because those aren't normal charges, but they are also causing your month to month bill go up.\n\nCustomer: Well, we want those.  Why would you have TV without at least 1 movie channel?\n\nMe: (that awkward fake laugh) of course!  I have one too for that reason!  In that case, I found something here, we may be able to use to lower everything without changing anything.  Let me see if this will work, give me one second. \n(stares at screen for about 30 seconds because I know that it will work but I need to make it sound like I'm making magic) ...and it does!  What I will do is take an additional $50 off your bill for 12 months.  That brings to about $15 less than what you signed up for.  To get that applied, I'll need to take a payment of the past due amount of $xx.xx, ok?\n\nCustomer: I don't understand.  Why do I have a past due amount?  And you mentioned late fees before.  I don't have late fees, I pay on the first of the month.\n\nMe: Let's take a look. (scrolls through billing)  Ok, so it looks like we have been 1 bill behind since sign up.  Your bills are issued on the first of every month due on the 22nd.  The April bill wasn't paid until 5/1.  By then, the new bill had been issued for May AND April plus a late fee.  You are absolutely right, you make a payment every month, at the same time, but it's not the full bill amount causing roll over amounts and late fees.\n\nCustomer: Listen, I'm a Veteran.  I only get paid once a month on the first.  I pay all my bills on the first.\n\n(for whatever reason, anyone who gets paid once a month, insists they can only pay their bills on that very day they get paid, no other day, ever)\n\nMe:Seeing that you get paid on the first and your due date isn't until the 22nd, you would never be late paying on the first.  But because the April bill didn't get paid until May, the May bill until June, and so on, the current amount due of $xxx.xx would be due by 12/22.  But if you can get that in, you're billing is all caught up!\n\nCustomer: Well that's not fair, don't you think?\n\n(THIS!  RIGHT HERE!  What part of anything I said isn't fair?  The part where you have a due date on a bill?  The part where you get charged late fees because you don't pay your bill by the due date?  The part where you are responsible for a bill for services you used?  The part where I'm offering to give you a $50 discount of your already discounted program because YOU WANT extra movie channels?  My jaw dropped and for the first time, I stared at my computer screen wondering what I was going to say)\n\nCustomer: You know what, just cancel my account.\n\nMe: I can still help you with that.  (Proceeds through disconnection)",

        "text": "Obligatory sorry for formatting, on mobile.\n\nI was browsing a bit earlier and found a story that reminded me of when I worked as and internet/phone repair rep for an ISP and of the first customer that ever got under my skin.\n\nI was running out of steam near the end of a long day and I get this prick on the phone and the call lasts the last hour of my shift. The ISP I worked for provided an optional email to customers with internet service (pro tip, never use your ISP's email system, they never work right and then if you change ISPs you lose your email that everyone you know has.) \n\nWell our email system was slowly be migrated to a new type of server. It was a painless process for most people but not everyone was thrilled as one can imagine.\n\nPrick called in unable to access his email. I think no biggie, the I see his account doesn't show he has an email address in either of our servers. Ok.....I probe more and find out the guy canceled his internet account a while ago before restarting it at a later time. When he did this he had his email transfered to his friends account so it wouldn't be deleted. \n\nAfter confirming the story by finding the email I have to inform him I can't touch it at this point with out friend's say so because legally its the friends email. Prick was not happy and would not let it end there. So upon prick's request and striding the fine line of violating policy and going above and beyond I call the friend.\n\nFriend verifies account and gives me the go ahead to make any changes needed to prick's email, including moving back to prick's account.\n\nPrick's email is still on old server, so I move it over, reset password. Prick tries it and the old server's website says maintenance  on server, no access for prick.\n\nAgain, he won't let it end there. So I take him through migrating it to the new server through his end (mistake) knowing it will fix the issue as the maintenance is due to forcing migration for certain email accounts in certain areas. \n\nHe submits it but it errors. Error message states he needs to agree to terms and conditions.  I tell him he needs to check the box stating as much.\n\nPrick proceeded to rip into me about how he isn't going to agree to anything without having a lawyer read it over with him.\n\nI inform him that he already had agreed before when the email was first set up and his continued use there after implied continued agreement. \n\nHe precedes to tell me how he never agreed to anything and how my company and I are just trying to screw him over.\n\nI apologize that he feels that way but explain right now this is the immediate fix, it was within his rights to not agree to the TaC on the new server but he would not have access to his email until maintenance on the old server was done.\n\nI ask if there is anything else i can help him with and he declines. I wrap up the call and just before I click hang up I hear it. \n\n\"Fucking idiot.\" \n\nNow, this guy had been rude and crude this entire time, I had gone out of my way to try and help him by calling his friend for him so i could fix the mess he had made for himself. Most reps would've left him SOL till his friend called us. I get him a solution and he accuses me of trying to personally screw him out of money or fuck him over in someway and refuses my last option. \n\nI remained patient and courteous through out the call.\n\nAnd he had the never to call me a fucking idiot when he thought I hung up and was waiting to go a survey on my performance. \n\nI was presented with the option of telling the guy how I \"appreciated his feed back sooooooo much\" or keeping my job. \n\nI opted for the later and hung up.\n\nTo this day I still get pissed thinking about it.",

But for right now, I’m gonna mention one I got that is infamous in my building. \n\nIt was a while back so I don’t remember exactly why this woman escalated to me, but I remember one of the additional reasons being the tone of our employee. So I took over with Weird Lady (WL) and dove right in. (I’ll be Me, duh)\n\nI attempt to help her for a little bit, but quickly things go downhill. I have a very calm customer service voice, and apparently that bothered her.\n\nWL: You’re talking to me like you want to sleep with me and I’m not a lesbian. Are you a lesbian?\n\nMe: Ma’am, I have no idea what you mean by that. This is just my voice. I’m just trying to help you here. \n\nWL: You sound like you want to have sex with me, little girl! And you’re so stupid. Tell me, how can you be that stupid? It must be because you’re from (Company’s location). You were born there and that’s what makes you stupid. Weren’t you born there?\n\nMe: No, but ma’am that is irrelevant. (There was my mistake)\n\nWL: Oh, where were you born then? Go on, tell me. \n\nMe: *sigh* New Jersey. \n\nWL: OH. JERSEY GIRL. JERSEY GIRL IS SO STUPID AND SHE WANTS TO FUCK ME.\n\nMe: Ma’am, we don’t tolerate that vulgar language and I will release the call if you continue. \n\nWL: Fuck you!\n\nAt this point I disconnected the call and started laughing. My supervisor found it, played it for our whole department, other supervisors heard it, etc. Now if I say anything about where I was born I hear a chorus of JERSEY GIRL across the room. \n\nOh, and she called back and got my coworker, who told her the same information I was telling her.

You only sent 3 out of the 8 pages. We need every. single. page.

I just had him and told him what the issue was and how it was to be fixed. He hung up on me saying I didn't know what I was talking about.\n\n**PJ**: Yeah umm, I just literally read off your notes to him and told him the same thing and he told me I was amazing and actually helped him.\n\n**Jane**: Wow that dude was a dick.\n\n*cue laugh track?*\n\nLater on another co worker got him and did the same exact thing. She told me that AG told her that \"**Jane** and **PJ** were stupid and didn't understand a thing they were talking about. They obviously need to be retrained\" and then my co worker tells AG the same exact thing me and Jane told him. He hung up and didn't call back. \n\nI just don't understand how you can call in, call one agent stupid and hang up, call back, thank one agent for doing a good job and call back again and do the whole thing over.

What do they pay you people for? Not to do your jobs?\n\nM: I'm sorry to hear that my colleague wasn't very helpful, but I promise that I can help you today.\n\nObligatory account information requested, some initial probing to figure out what he wanted. He's having issues with his TV - no signal, no response with remote, etc. He says the STB is on and tells me that the error message says \"no signal\". I'm thinking great, I know exactly what this is. Easy. To put the cherry on top of my sundae, he calms down after I start building rapport. Great, right?\n\nM: Okay sir, I need you to be my eyes here, okay?\n\nC: Okay\n\nM: I need you to tell me what lights you see on your cable box. What colours are they?\n\nC: No lights on at all. Nothing's working!\n\nI'm thinking okay, no problem. We'll just skip a few steps and get right to the rebooting. I start trying to walk him through literally unplugging and plugging in the equipment. Before I know it, we're forty minutes into the call and this guy isn't getting a single thing I'm saying. Then he drops this on me:\n\nM: It's just the black cord. All I need you to do is -\n\nC: *clearly frustrated* This is silly.\n\nM: Don't worry, sir, you're doing great! I'm sure between the two of us we can -\n\nC: No, no, it isn't that. I've just never had to turn it on before to make it work.\n\nM: ... I'm sorry?\n\nC: It's always just worked. I don't need to turn it on. The picture just comes on when I want it to.\n\nM: *slowly realizing what the problem is* Sir, is your TV turned on right now?\n\nC: No, I just told you. I've never had to turn my TV on to make it work before!\n\nM: ... Sir, how do you watch TV without the TV on?\n\nC: What do you mean, how do I watch TV? I just watch TV. The pictures are always there!\n\nM: ... And how did you see a \"no signal\" error message if your TV isn't turned on?\n\nC: I just knew it would be there! I don't need to turn it on for that! Don't you people know anything?!\n\nI've never hit the mute button so fast in my life. ",

        "text": "\nThis story was related to me by **Paul**, the hero in this story, so I take no responsibility for the ultimate truth of the story. Having said that, **Paul** has experience in a Canadian lawyer’s office, and a fiesty disposition, so *I* believe this is *exactly* as it went down.  \n\n\nCast:  \n\n**Paul**: our hero. Why **Paul**? That’s his name.  \n\n**Dave**: **Paul’s** sidekick.  \n\n**Supervisor**: **Paul** and **Dave’s** direct supervisor (Team Lead)  \n\n**Manager**: **Supervisor’s** manager (Ops Manager)  \n\n\n**Paul** worked for a Canadian branch of an India-based call centre company, on the tech support contract for an American based electronics company (based in Cupertino, CA). Got that? Whew.  \n\nThis particular call centre (at the time) had an issue with fulfilling the “Agents available” criteria of their contract, and was “offering” lots of overtime. “Offering”, as in *“Hey! It’s your day off! How much overtime can I put you down for?”*  \n\n“That’s not so bad”, I hear you say.  \n\nTrue, if *”No”* was an acceptable answer, and if *“overtime”* actually involved additional pay. Or additional time off. Or...any sort of compensation.  \n\n“But that’s illegal!”, I hear you cry.  \n\nI do believe you are correct, but I Am Not A Lawyer^TM. From **Paul’s** information, the company was playing fast and loose with “banked” overtime, storing it up for future days off, but then would never approve the time off requests, until agents simply quit (or were fired).\n\n\n**On to our story!**\n\n\nOur hero was relaxing over breakfast one morning on his day off, when the phone rang. Work? Le sigh. But wait… lightbulb!  \n\n&gt;**Paul**: &lt;slurring&gt; ...Y’ello?  \n\n&gt;**Supervisor**: **Paul**, we need you for overtime. What time can you come in?  \n\n&gt;**Paul**: Ahhhhh….  \n\n&gt;**Supervisor**: I’ve got you set up for 30 minutes from now.  \n\n&gt;**Paul**: ….OK…..shure……  \n\n&gt;**Supervisor**: OK. See you soon. &lt;click&gt;  \n\n\nOne call to **Dave** later….  \n\n\n&gt;**Paul**: **Davo**!! We’re going to punk **Supervisor**!!  \n\n&gt;**Dave**: Dude!  \n\n&gt;**Paul**: Dude!\n\n&gt;**Dave**: Du-ude!!  \n\n&gt;**Paul**: **Supervisor** is going to call for overtime. Trust me; just accept it, and say as little as possible. We’re going to pretend we’re drunk!  \n\n&gt;**Dave**: Pretend. Drunk. Got it. Cya.  \n\n\n    **{{A little while later}}**  \n\n\n**Paul** and **Dave** “sneak” in to work, and log in to the phones to “start work”. Now, let me paint a picture for you. They are (apparently) wearing the same clothes as the previous day, but now wrinkled. Unshaven, they smell like they have been bathing in beer, and gargling with whiskey. And when I say “sneak”, I mean that their progress would not have been out of character for Bugs Bunny at his most outrageous.  \n\nWithin minutes of taking a seat, **Manager** comes scurrying over, possibly alerted by the aroma surrounding our intrepid heroes.  \n\n\n&gt;**Manager**: Why are you here?  \n\n&gt;**Paul** and **Dave**: &lt;in unison&gt; We’re doing overtime! &lt;happy smiles&gt;  \n\n&gt;**Manager**: But you can’t work drunk! How can you already be drunk?? It’s not even 9AM!  \n\n&gt;**Paul**: We’re not *already* drunk, we’re *still* drunk. &lt;happier smiles&gt;  \n\n&gt;**Manager**: Who authorized this??  \n\n&gt;**Paul** and **Dave**: &lt;in unison&gt; **Supervisor**. &lt;helpful pointing&gt;  \n\n&gt;**Manager**: Fine! I’ll deal with this. You guys, *go home*!  \n\n&gt;**Paul**: &lt;suddenly laser-focused&gt; But you’re going to pay us our 3 hours^[1], right?  \n\n&gt;**Manager**: Buh...buh...buh…. &lt;defeated&gt; ^Yes.  \n\n\nNote for non-Canadians: Canadian (or at least Ontario) labour law has a 3 hour minimum shift length, to protect part-time workers from getting &lt;copulated&gt; by their employers.  \n\n\nSo our valiant heroes galloped off into the sunset, secure in the knowledge they had made the world a better place. Actually, they wandered off home, and were never, ever called for overtime again. And yes, they did get their 3 hours pay.  \n\n\n**TL;DR**: Call centre agents act drunk and get paid.",

You call me when your washer or refrigerator goes out in some way, shape, or form I handle the call to fix it, or get yelled at. \n\nThis particular call was about a refrigerator. I shall be Bug, PG will be Pyro-Guy and Dead will be my Supervisor. \n\nI started off with my typical spill, asked for his name, number, address, etc...making sure it matched his account and delving in to see what the problem was. \n\nBug: So, what can I do for you today PG?\n\nPG: The guy that just came out to my house said the part was going to be $300! YOUR REPRESENTATIVE SAID THE PART WAS COVERED!\n\nI blinked, took my headset off my ears and cranked the sound up so he could yell and I could still talk without blowing out my eardrums again. Yellers I swear...\n\nBug: I apologize for that shock sir, let me see where that promissory is, please hold. \n\nI did for a while, see the half written notes my coworker from a different office left behind and groaned. I swear I get so many yellers over hafl-assed notes from that office. I scanned for any coverage or potential limited warranties on the refrigerator, nothing. No notes stating parts coverage, a 7 year old refrigerator with no extended warranties or parts limited on it. \n\nOh joy, I can feel the rage already. I gave him a moment to chill even further and to repeat my wording to make sure it doesn't sound too off putting. \n\nBug: Sorry about that wait, PG, I dug through your file and I did see where you spoke to X and she scheduled you service.\n\nPG: YEAH AND?\"\n\nBug: I know this isn't what you wanted to hear but I don't see any promise to cover the costs of parts. I under-\n\nPG: THAT'S A BULLSHIT LIE AND YOU KNOW IT!!\n\nBug: ....sir? I apologize but X left no notes nor created an insurance claim to say that we were covering anything. That refrigerator is six years old, at this point in time I cannot offer anything else to assist.\n\nPG: THAT'S F-ING RIDICULOUS! YOU ALL ARE NOTHING MORE THAN THIEVING RATS!!! I AM GOING TO BURN DOWN EVERY APPLIANCE FROM YOUR COMPANY I COME ACROSS AND THROW ALL OF MINE OUT!!! YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FIRES BECAUSE SHE PROMISED!!!!\n\nI blinked. And blinked again. As he was threatening violence I offered to send him to a supervisor, he denied screamed one last great \"F YOU!!\" and slammed the phone down leaving me to hear the crash and more swearing as he didn't break it nor turn it off until I could disconnect it.\n\nWhat is WITH people nowadays? \n",

        "text": "\nHey all,\n\nI'm reaching the end of my rope here. I work for a major company collecting on business wireless/cell phone accounts. Been here a couple of years. My reasons for wanting out...\n\n1. Low glass ceiling: Only way I can move up is to stay here for fifteen years and I might get a manager position.\n\n2. Quality creates it's own work: The ones that review our calls legit come up with these subjective issues on people's calls. So folks get stressed out over some other persons opinion, even though quality cant take calls at the same level as the people they make up bs to tax others on. \n\n3. Managers are pretty hands off or outright lazy: My current manager doesn't even respond to my emails at times. Any issue you have you're met with this attitude that's really a front for laziness. I asked my manager to fix my time card cause I was punched in on my computer as six minutes late (we have a five minute grace period) but I was logged into my phone on time, three or so minutes after. I have done this multiple times in the past without any issue. I email said supe, and she says she'll make an 'exception' but moving forward it will be considered as late...aka I don't want to do anything but waddle my silly @ss into work and collect a check. If this was the case half the floor should have been termed months ago. \n\n4. Incompetence: The management here, most aren't fit to hold sixty percent of the floors jock strap. A lot of ambitionless, idiotic, shiftless people who only want to do the bare minimum in life. Almost always, these managers avoid taking escalated calls. They tell us to blast it over our chat, but its just a waste of time...no one ever responds cause they don't want to take it, which leaves us hanging. Then, when you go up to a manager, they say just give the cust what they want aka do whatever you have to so we, the managers, don't have to talk to anyone. \n\n5. Simple co-workers: Some of these people are cool, the rest are some of the silliest, moronic, good for nothing bums you've ever met. One young chick, lets call her...Fran. Fran is the type of chick to instigate, talk all loud to bring attention to herself (her voice is also annoying and scratchy) she hacks and spits extra loud, worships and models part of her personality after Cardi B, talks about how \"thick\" she is, etc...okay....this broad has a young child at home, shape the f##k up! Literally one of the most annoying and idiotic women I have ever come across...and thick? She's easily 80 lbs overweight. Other than Stand up Fran, most others are socially off people. Super negative, wear a scowl all day, avoid eye contact, talk trash about people behind their back, etc. Not all, but a lot of very low class people inside a call center, a lot of people are adults only in age and in the eyes of the law...a lot are still children. \n\n5. Attendance policy: This place doesn't tell you about gained time off unless you ask management, and they will do any and everything to get at your vacation time/pto to leave you without options come the middle of the year (we get our vacation time at the beginning of the year).\n\nI told my gf I'm on the verge of just standing up and walking out, I've already cleared my desk. To anyone going through it, I'm with you, we're gonna get out of here, and get something way better...money can't buy mental or emotional health.",

They clearly are on speakerphone.  I will refer to myself as (S). Before they were sent to me, the previous agent explains they are looking to reverse a payment, which we cannot do. The payment was for maybe $150.00. I accept the call and walk into the storm.\n\nS: *Call disclosures* This is spikus93, I just spoke with the previous rep and understand that there's an issue with a payment and you want to reverse the payment, is that correct?\n\nM: *with sarcasm in voice* Oh thank Goodness, this one understands.\n\nW: So do it! Reverse the payment. \n\nS: Our payments are not refundable except in cases of error on our part. Youe referring to you recent payment from yesterday I presume, not the one from 2 weeks ago, correct?\n\nW: Yes, and we want our money back now! We need it! \n\nS: So was there an error that took place? Why does this payment need reversed?\n\nM: None of your business!\n\nW: We paid you and thought we could afford it but something more important came up and we need the money back.\n\nM: Don't tell him that! It ain't his business.\n\nS: I'm not sure I can help you with a refund if the payment was made and processed already and your reason seems to be changing your mind about it. \n\nW: But it's important! He needs this, you're killing him!\n\nS: Huh? Is everything alright? \n\nM: *shifting strategies now apparently, becomes choked up and tearful* No it ain't. Our baby needs diapers and food.\n\nW:*begins sobbing through words* We need the money to buy baby food. He's only 6 months old and we don't have any more baby food or diapers!\n\nS: I'm so sorry to hear that struggle. I cannot refund a payment on my end. As I said we can only refund payments made in error on our parent.\n\nM: It was an error! We didn't know we needed it until now!\n\nS: But we didn't double charge you, or make any mistakes processing a payment, the error was on your side. \n\nW: Then you won't give us our money back?\n\nS: I'd love to, but I can't. My hands are tied.\n\nW: Then you're a murderer! I'm calling the police!\n\nS: Pardon me? Murderer?\n\nW: My baby will starve to death because of you! You evil bastard!\n\nS: Okay, obviously I don't want to harm your child. I understand how you feel, because I'm a father and have an infant at home. I know how expensive taking care of them can be. I'm going to try to give you some advice on how to fix this, but I can't - \n\nW: *Sobbing and Screaming now* But he'll die because of you!\n\nS: I'm not going to take responsibility for your child. I am doing my job. My job is not to parent your child. I am sorry. I will file a complaint and request a payment reversal, but it will be denied because this was not our error.\n\nM: Have a heart man!\n\nS: I'm doing everything I can for you.  Your only other recourse here is to contact your bank and see if they can reverse the payment. However, if they initiate a charge back, it could have negative consequences on your account with us or with them.  I'd advise stop using the card to spend until things stabilize, and if the payments are too high, let us know. We may be able to lower them and close the account to keep it from growing more.\n\nM: Now he's threatening to close our account, babe!\n\nW: You're an awful person. I hope you go to hell.\n\nS: Alright. I've done my part to try to help you. I do not have to remain on the line if you're hostile towards me. Have a nice day.\n\n**Click**\n\n\nI'm responsible for child murder now, probably. I shouldn't have told them to contact their bank because they'll just enter a fraud dispute and do a chargeback, which we would win since they made a payment within our terms. Buyer's remorse isn't an excuse.",

        "text": "I was working in sales for pay mounthly conttacts for mobiles in a call centre last year and a call was transferred to me from billing. Before the other agent passed it on she gave me the heads up that the caller was a bit weird which if we are being honest a lot of callers are but this guy was really out there.\n\nMe: hi this is David in ______ how can I help you today \nC: hi this is John how can I.. eh .... em help me \n\nGot a bit of a laugh of this straight out of the gate but we pushed on John tells me he wants to buy a phone for his daughter to and I quote \"show up that bitch of an ex wife\" he then went onto complain about his ex for 20 minutes and every time I tried to talk about the phone he would just go back to his ex and complain some more.  I've had people vent on the phone to me in the past but this was extreme. All of a sudden his tone changed.\n\nC:ah fuck this is her \nMe: that's fine sir if you want you can take the call and call back in \nC:no no I'll just get rid of the bitch \n\nThe caller answered the call and put me on hold after about a minute a women comes through the line to me \n\nW: how fucking dare you John what do you fucking want John what do you fucking want!!\nMe: (in an absolute panic) hi this is just David for _____ I think the wires have gotten a bit crossed and the line has dropped on John \nW: of course it has BYE! \n\nAt this point I was just glad the call was over and I went to disconnect from my end but John hadn't dropped the line he had just made a conference call\n\nC: Jesus sorry about that man that's the ex wife don't mind that dirty cow.\n\nBefore I could say anything it turns out she had done the same thing and just pretended to hang up bit just stayed quite \n\nW: how dare you John how fucking dare you!! We will have words goodbye \n\nC: oh god man oh god do you think she heard \nMe: yeah I think she did \nC: oh fuck now way that's like something out of a move that couldn't of happened no way \nMe: very sorry sir I'm going to have to put you on hold for just a minute \n\nI then sat there for 5 minutes with him on hold and told the story to the people around me. The tape is still played in the call centre sometimes as a joke \n",

        "text": "This was literally my first call today which put me in a foul mood for the entire day. Take a fucking xanax people, it's too damn early for this shit. \n\n\nCaller: I'm calling about some old payments I've been trying to collect all year. No one has responded to me or helped me at all with this so I'm getting really frustrated. These are from APRIL.\n\n\nMe: *still waking up and drinking my coffee, rolling my eyes* Ok, I can help you with that. Can you tell me what dates I'm looking for in April to see what's going on?\n\n\nC: Huh?\n\n\nMe: You said this was from April, I would like to look up the stay for the customer you are referring to?\n\n\nC: Um, no, April is when I FAXED it.\n\n\nMe: Then can I have the dates for the stay? I can't look it up without it.\n\n\nC: The name is (Customer), he was in room XXX, and the invoice number is (Long-ass number).\n\n\nMe: And the dates of stay?\n\n\nC: IF YOU WOULD STOP TALKING, THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU!!\n\n\nMe: All you've given me is their name, invoice number, room number and the date you faxed it, I do need this information but until you give me the dates I don't know where to start looking, ma'am. \n\n\nC: UGH. January 9th. Last year.\n\n\nMe: Did they arrive or leave on that date?\n\n\nC: That's the invoice date.\n\n\nMe: Ok, that gives me a place to start. Please hold. *pull info* Ok, I see it. We didn't get this until last month, so it was not accepted due to the age of the invoice. We can no longer process this for you, you will have to go directly to this customer for payment. \n\n\nC: But you people have had this since APRIL!!\n\n\nMe: I see no record of this being received until last month. When you faxed it in April it looks like we didn't get it. \n\n\nC: This is why I can't stand any of you. No one told us any of this.\n\n\nMe: How are we supposed to know a stay has taken place until you bill us? How are we supposed to know the fax YOU sent hasn't come through? \n\n\nC: Well there's (Customer) from June, no one's bothered to pay that yet and I faxed it as soon as I knew it wasn't sent in online.\n\n\nMe: *searching as she's talking* I don't see anything under that name for a stay in June-\n\n\nC: Are you even listening? It was in MARCH.\n\n\nMe: You said June.\n\n\nC: I FAXED IT IN JUNE.\n\n\nMe: I still don't see that we have ever received it. It's close to being too old but you can still send it again and we will try.\n\n\nC: Explain to me how can you not receive it when I know I faxed it.\n\n\nMe: Faxes aren't foolproof, sometimes they don't come through, for any number of reasons. It's why we give you a confirmation notice online when we get a fax from you, so you know if you don't get that something might be wrong.\n\n\nC: Why the hell has no one told me any of this until now??\n\n\nMe: I can't answer that. All I can do is give you the information now, since I've never spoken to you before.\n\n\nC: Well, I talked to (coworker), and (other coworker), and they never said any of this.\n\n\nAt this point, my voice is starting to get shaky because I am so royally pissed off at this person.\n\n\nMe: Ok, but they are not ME, so I am giving you all the information that I can so you understand why we are in this situation. \n\n\nC: I just can't believe I've tried to fix this all year and your company has gone out of their way to make it harder for me at every turn and NOW some snotty receptionist is telling me I can't have the money I am owed!\n\n\nMe: I am NOT a receptionist. I am an accountant trained specifically to HELP businesses like yourself get paid, but I can't do everything for you. Why would you wait ten months to check on a payment for something you were so sure we had?\n\n\nC: I'm going to have to get my boss and get some paperwork together to decide how we want to move forward with this. Your company can't just get away with theft of service like this.\n\n\nMe: We are a third party. There are contracts in place that explicitly state this and outline what to do when invoices become too old, which is what I have advised you to do. You need to contact this customer directly.\n\n\nC: What is your name?\n\n\nMe: sh605.\n\n\nC: Well, you can expect a call from collections. I'll get my money one way or the other, believe me.\n\n\nMe: Good luck. *disconnect*\n\n\nAw man, she's gonna sic collections on me, guys. :( With only my first name\n\n\nEdit: Gold!! Thank you kind person!",

        "text": "I work at a call center in the sales department of one of the largest ESCOs (Energy Service Company) in the US. I do cold calling but I also take incoming calls along with a few other agents when available. I get all kinds of calls ranging from people who would like to; enroll, terminate their account, speak with a specific agent or have their number taken off our calling list.\n\nSo I'm having a weak day, only have one sale and I'm tired from calling. I almost went home early but decided to push a little more.\n\nSo I get this anonymous call from a number not registered on our system.\n\nMe: Hi. Thank you for calling _____ Energy. My name is Sam. How may I help you?\n\nHer: Hi. I would like you to take my number off your list.\n\nMe: Not a problem. I see you're calling from a different number than the one we called you on as this one is not registered in our system. Would you like to tell me the number you want removed?\n\nHer: You have my number. You just called it.\n\nMe: Yes ma'am. We do. But we have a lot of agents who call hundreds of people every day. So to find your number, I need you to tell me what it is.\n\nHer: No, you're lying. You just called it. Take it off your list!\n\nMe: Ma'am, I did not call your number. It must have been a different agent. If you just tell me the number, I'll be more than happy to take it off the list.\n\nHer: No, you're a liar. I know you have it. Stop lying to me! \n\nMe: I am not lying to you ma'am. This is the only number I see right now, the one you're calling on right now. Is that the one you'd like me to remove?\n\nHer: No! I want you to remove the one you just called me on!\n\nMe: Look ma'am, if you want your number taken off our list, just tell me the number and I'll take it off, otherwise I cannot help you. I just don't know what number it is. \n\n(This goes on for 5 minutes already) \n\nHer: You are such a liar. I want to speak with your manager. Right now!\n\nMe: Ma'am, my manager won't be able to help you either if you won't provide us with your number. If you say that we have the number why can't you just tell it to us since we already have it? Once I find it in our system, I'll be happy t---\n\nHer: You are so rude! Give me the manager! I want to speak with your manager! (I'm not really supposed to bother the manager about this as she won't be able to help her either)\n\n(However, I'm a little nervous now as I never had this problem before so I get up to tell the manager who's in the middle of a meeting)\n\nMe: I'm sorry but my manager is busy right now...\n\nHer: Oh right she's busy, how convenient for you. Stop lying to me!\n\nMe: Ma'am I promise you I am not lying, if you won't give the number to take off the list, I'm afraid I can't help you and I'm going to have to hang up the phone.\n\n(She continued shouting and screaming how I'm a liar so I just hung up on her which I felt pretty bad about as that was the first time I ever hung up on a caller. However I was a little relieved now after all the verbal abuse I got)\n\n(I immediately get another incoming call) \n\nMe: Hi. _____ Energy. How may I help you?\n\n(It was the same woman)\n\nHer: I would like to speak with the manager.\n\n(I hung up on her again, she calls back immediately now for the third time) \n\n(I was really anxious now, speechless actually as I never encountered such a problem before. And I'm not sure if she knew it was me again so I just said) \n\nMe: OK, hold on a moment please.\n\n(I get up, put myself on mute and think for a second... I decide to get one of my coworkers to say he's the supervisor when in truth he's just another agent like me)\n\nSo he ends up talking to her for over 10mins. I feel bad as time is money in this office. I hear him apologizing \"He was rude to you? I'm sorry to hear that Emily\".\n\nNow I'm thinking \"she gave him her name but not her number?! What's wrong with her?\" I hear him reading out our number, the same one she used to call us, telling her that when she finds her number she should call this number and we'll take it off.\n\nAfter the call he tells me she apologized to him as she doesn't know her number (I guess she must have moved to a new place) so I'm going crazy now! Why couldn't she just tell me that? What did I say? Was she embarrassed? Was it her ego? Sigh.\n\nI left work an hour early that day, right after that. I was finished.\n\nThe next day another one of our agents got the call from her and took her number off the list. Phew! The agent then teased me about how she said I was rude, when she didn't know her own number and ended up wasting over 20 minutes of our valuable time.\n\nSure, it's my fault. You live and learn. Now I know what to ask for next time, \"Why don't you call me back when you know what your number is and I'll be happy to take it off.\"\n\nBut in all seriousness I'd love to hear what you guys think on how I could have handled this better. Let me know! ",

        "text": "Bibo back with another story from an auto insurance call center.\n\nOne of the big things that gets stressed in training in becoming an insurance sales rep is to avoid using the term \"full coverage.\" It's a term that gets tossed around a lot when it comes to buying a car, and we are not supposed to use it directly when building an insurance policy with a customer because it can be misleading when people because people can end up thinking they have more coverage than they really do. Ask yourself, does full coverage mean you will get a free rental car if your car is damaged? I certainly don't know, and neither does anyone else for sure.\n\nOne really annoying part of this is that when you buy a car, often the dealer and financing company will actually tell you, \"You are required to have full coverage for this loan\" which makes our job an absolute nightmare sometimes because people want a direct answer from us if their coverage meets their financing company's minimum criteria to drive the car they want to buy when we have absolutely no control over what they require e.g. the maximum deductibles.\n\nNow, what most financing companies mean when they say \"full coverage\" is that you need to have \"Collision\" coverage to pay for the damage to your car if you get into a wreck even if it is your fault, and \"Comprehensive\" coverage to pay for damage to your car from basically anything else like weather, theft, animals, etc..., in addition to state-mandated liability coverage which pays for damage you cause to others.\n\nSo cue Bane of My Existence, or BME. He is calling me from the dealership, which is a terrible experience half the time because usually people calling from the dealer: 1) Have been there for many hours and want to go home, 2) Are frustrated because they ended up spending a lot more than they planned to on the car they bought and, thus, *always* get mad when they need to pay for the insurance too, and 3) Are impatient as all hell and uncooperative as a result, not wanting to answer questions, etc... \n\nAfter I do start the process of adding his new car to his policy:\n\n&gt;Me: BME, now that I have taken down the vehicle information, I need to go over your coverages, allow me to explain what coverages we offer... *And so I explain in excruciating detail how comprehensive and collision coverages are what most financing companies require and the way ALL the auto insurance coverages work*\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Me:Okay BME, now that I have explained the liability, comprehensive, and collision coverages to you, I assume that since you are financing your car, your lienholder has some requirements about coverage and probably a limit on your deductibles is that right?\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;BME: Yes, I also need to have full coverage. The financing company says I need that.\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Me: Right, remember, like I said earlier, full coverage does not have an exact meaning so I need to clarify what exactly they want you to have, what they usually mean is-\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;BME: Right, full coverage they said.\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Me: *Kill me please.* Right, full coverage isn't really an actual coverage, it's a phrase people use to talk about a variety of coverages so I need to understand what they need you to have.\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;BME: Oh okay. *Chatters in the background to some guy at the dealership.* Yes, they said I need to have full coverage please.\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Me: Sir, as I have said a few times, I do not know what they mean when you say full coverage, does that mean they need you to have medical payments coverage? Do they need you to have uninsured motorist coverage? Or do they just mean you need to have comprehensive and collision?\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;BME: Look, I don't know why this is taking so long, I just want to have the lowest full coverage you have so I can take the car off the lot...\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Me: (*What the hell does that even mean? Lowest full coverage???*) Look sir, for legal reasons I am unable to tell you if your policy has 'full coverage' or not, it does not have an exact definition, it means different things to different people. I do not know if this is enough to satisfy your lienholder, only they know what they require. Please, you are there with them, ask someone if they mean comprehensive and collision when they say 'full coverage.'\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;BME: **Loud-ass sigh.** Fine, hold on.... *More chatter.* Yes they said that's fine, as long as it's full coverage.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point I wanted to bang my head into a wall I was so done with this call.\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Me: Sir, as I have explained to you multiple times tonight. I. CANNOT. TELL YOU. If this is full coverage. If you are happy with this coverage, I will get this change submitted so I can send you your proof of insurance.\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;BME: Okay finally, just send me the documents that is what I was waiting for.\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Me: *YES THANK GOD* Okay sir I have submitted the change and sent the documents to your dealer.\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;BME: Okay thank you, took you long enough. Now, to be clear this is full coverage right?",

        "text": "This is my first post on TFCC so bear with me if I didn't understand rules completely.\n\nI had a call today that really drove me up. I've been working with call centers for about 6 years now, and I'd say I'm pretty hazed as far as customer complaints, the stress, and everything that goes in and out both good and bad of call centers. Today though, someone really REALLY got to me. \n\nConversation went as such.\n\nThe lady was asking about information on her bill. As jolly as I always am on the phone, I ask for her account number or her phone number so I can locate her account. I generally try to use SSN as a last resort between the 3 since people do try to avoid handing that info out, even though...your bank has it. They have to have it. She refuses to give it since she wants to complain about her problem rather than let me see the account. When she pauses for a moment I ask her again, and she provides me with her phone number since she doesn't have her account number...even though I inform her it's on the statement she is holding in her hand or on the screen in front of her.\n\nSo then it comes down to her SSN. Oh boy did she blow up...\n\"You don't need my SSN. No other company asks for that.\" I politely inform her, \"I can name 6 companies off the top of my head who require my SSN to do business with me.\" She cuts me off even further, \"You are wrong, you need to get a real job than working with *insert company name here* (Even though that's not the company I work with, we partner with this company to offer private label cards).\"\n\nI informed her of the last fact, and she then followed up with \"I don't care who you work with, no bank should require my SSN.\" At this point, I've lost my cool. Normally I can hang onto it, but WHEN YOU CALL US FOR HELP...I need to get a real job? Even though I make well over the minimum wage and you're asking for my help right now.\n\n\nOkay so lets fast forward a little bit to a little less of a detrimental call, but still bothering after that one. \n\nThird party calls in on behalf of his wife, who she is the only one on the account. He starts listing his issue calmly, and I try to resolve it calmly with as general info I can provide back and forth. I try to guide him through his statement he has in front of him without providing any personal account information, since it would be against compliance...which means I'm breaking the law. After about 5 minutes of trying to assist him with his issue on his statement, I ask if the primary, his wife, is nearby so I can ask for her permission to speak with him. He replies with, \"No, I'm at work. I'm her husband, I have her on my account, I should be able to call about this.\" I inform him it's his account pulled up and ask him to verify the account number he's calling about. He never does, and proceeds to complain about the fact he's her husband and he shouldn't need to be on the account to call about it. He then asks to escalate. I ask his reason why for my purpose to provide to the manager I'm transferring to. He replies with, \"I'm her spouse, I shouldn't need to be authorized on the account to speak with you.\" I have basically started losing it again, \"So you're a third party calling to speak on someone elses account?\" (Probably shouldn't had said that...) \"I'm not a third party, I'm her husband.\" \n\n\"Okay, give me a moment and I'll get you to a specialist who can help you (who won't).\" Fast forward 5 minutes, he disconnects while transferring. \n\nToday sucked.",

Amounts changed for simplification.\n\n\n\nCaller: I have a problem with a check you guys sent us, it isn't adding up. \n\n\n\nMe: Oh, that's not good, give me the check number and let's have a look. *pulls up info* I see it's in the amount of $400, what are you showing that it should be?\n\n\n\nC: $500.\n\n\n\nMe: Alright, so looks like you had 2 items that are payments we were taking back in the amount of $100, did you see those? That's why your check was only $400.\n\n\n\nC: Yeah, why are you taking payments back?\n\n\n\nMe: *research* Looks like there's a couple of items the company is disputing. We've taken payments back because no one has answered our calls or letters so we could have you send us the proof we would need to allow you to keep the payments. \n\n\n\nC: Well they're wrong, and that's not fair!\n\n\n\nMe: We did try repeatedly to reach out. No worries though, I just need to get you to that company's rep to find out what our options are at this point. Would you like to speak to them?\n\n\n\nC: Yes, but before that, my check still doesn't add up. \n\n\n\nMe: Yes, items we have paid previously are being taken back, so the check is shortpaid. You will need to make some adjustments to balance your books until this situation is resolved.\n\n\n\nC: It's not just that!! It should be $500!\n\n\n\nMe: Miss, there are a total of ten items being paid at $50 each, which IS $500. However, there are two items being deducted at $50 each, which gives you $400. \n\n\n\nC: That doesn't make sense.\n\n\n\nMe: Well.... Think of it this way. Two of your $50 payments are being voided by the deductions, so it's as if you're being paid for eight items at $50, which is $400. \n\n\n\nC: But there are ten.\n\n\n\nMe: Correct.... ten payments and two deductions. The deductions are being offset by two payments. Ten minus two is eight.\n\n\n\nC: Nine.\n\n\n\nMe: I'm sorry, did you just say nine?\n\n\n\nC: Yeah, ten payments minus one deduction.\n\n\n\nMe: .....There are two deductions......\n\n\n\nC: Can I just get a new check without all these minuses on it?\n\n\n\nMe: No, that would throw off our accounting, these are items your business currently owes, and the only way we can take them back is from your payments. That's like asking us to just cover the $100 you owe to this other company.\n\n\n\nC: I'm not good at this. Can you wait while I ask my boss?\n\n\n\nMe: Sure.\n\n\n\nBoss thankfully takes over, and understands me completely. They ask to be transferred to resolve the dispute, and as I start to transfer the call, I hear the boss covering the phone and saying \"So there are ten payments.......\"\n\n\n\nGood luck, buddy.",

I muted my end and stayed on the line while she spoke with him because I was curious as to how this would turn out.\n\nHe proceeds to tell her the issue and how he's horribly disappointed in the company for doing this to him. He tells her to \"go into his account and get on finding out why this happened\". She tried to verify him and he refuses to give her any information whatsoever. Without this we cannot do a thing.\n\n\"You don't need to do any of that. You just need to do what I tell you.\"\n\nHe just goes off and berates her and calls her stupid and insult after insult. She's not one to take that from anyone so she basically disconnected him (after several warnings of course).\n\nMy advice to you, my dear Kimberly, is to start looking elsewhere for someone to provide you services because your account is on its way to legal to be blacklisted from ever calling our customer service line again!

        "text": "Note: sorry for formatting. I am on mobile.\nAlso just found this sub and I think I found my reddit home! \n\nSome background: I work for a company that manages employee absences from work for employers. Think, FMLA-Family Medical Leave, State Leave Laws and Corporate (Company Sponsored) Leave Policies.  These policies/laws/acts are there to protect the employees job from occurrences which can lead to termination due to their own health condition or that of a family member.  Most people I talk to have either chronic health conditions  or a family member with a health condition and are very appreciative to have these laws/policies to protect their job. With that being said, they are RESPONSIBLE  human beings and call in their absences and follow the rules/guidelines.  HOWEVER...there are still people that abuse, misuse the system or in general are rude/toxic people to deal with.  Calling in an absence from work  can take all of 5 minutes to complete. \n\nFor the employers they have the right to have a notice requirement. A notice requirement is the amount of time an employee has to call my company to report that they will be absence from work so it won’t count against their employers attendance policy...\n\nSome companies have very strict reporting policies such as before their shift starts, the same day...etc.  for this call, the employee had 48 hours to call us. Ex: if you leave work on Tuesday at 12:00pm you have to call my company before 12:00 on Thursday to notify.   I will be SB and callee is EW(Entitled Woman)\n\nSB: Hello, my name is SB, May I have your name, verification information. \n\nEW:  My name is EW and etc. and I left work early the other day. \n\nSB: Okay, I can help you get that time reported. \n\n(I take the absence information and notice it is outside the employers notice requirement. This employee had to call in by 12:00 on Thursday(48 hours)  it’s now close to 4:00pm on Thursday. \n\nSB: Thank you EW, that absence is saved but is denied due to your employers reporting requirement. (At this point I explain to her how much time she had to call in the absence it’s standard procedure to remind the person of the requirement). \n\nEW: Thats not fair! I called earlier to report and no one answered!  I was on hold for 10 minutes and hung up because I had to go do my job.!\n\nSB: I apologize EW that our hold times have been longer than usual.  However it is your responsibility to report an abs within the timeframe outlined by your employer.  \n\nEW: Well this shouldn’t count against me! That’s bullshit policy from your company and now I am going to get a point!  You need to get this fixed! \n\n\nSB:  EW, I do apologize that the time is denied but going forward your employer does offer other ways than having to call in to report the absence.  These were all outlined in the letters we have sent you and in your online account. I can send this to your specialist to review but since you didn’t actually speak to anyone or report the absence another way it will still be denied. \n\nEW: Fine! Send it to the specialist since you can’t do anything for me! \n\nAt this point I am fed up with being yelled at by this woman but I go through the process of reminding her HOW MANY DIFFERENT WAYS she could have notified us. \n\nSB: EW  we are open 12 hours a day if you want to call in your absence, after we close we also have a third party vendor that answers our calls and reports the absence till midnight. And then there is the automated system where you could report the time and finally you could have just went online to report the time in the last 48 HOURS.  \n\nEW: Well whatever, this is just some crap to get me fired. \n\nSB: Actually EW these policies are in place to protect your job and it is your responsibility to call within that time frame so we can notify your employer within a timely manner.  Is there anything else I can help you with today? \n\nEW: No *click* \n\n\nI will never understand the lack of responsibility  in some people. Always trying to shift the blame. In this case I didn’t feel bad for the woman, she was rude and it wasn’t her first time calling in from work, more like the 7th time that month. \n\n\n\n",

For those who haven't seen my stories, I work as a tier 2 tech support agent for an ISP.\n\n\nThis story is about a ticket I recieved a call about from a Tech. It was sent off a few days ago and had just today reached a technician. The ticket was for a standard no connection issue but was also affecting the phone. The Tech needed some information that only I or my other coworkers can access. I provided it to him. This conversation ensues:\n\n\nT: ...now I'm just going to go check the terminal to see what's going on here--  \n\n\n**SQUAWK!**\n\n\nT: *profanity, shuffling noises* Well, I know why they're having issues. There's a crow's nest inside the terminal! Close the ticket. I can't do anything here. I'm going to call animal control and have them moved.\n\n\nAfter hearing that, I sat for a few minutes going over if I really just heard that there's a crow nesting inside the terminal box. When I realized that I did just hear that, I closed the ticket with the following: \n\n\n\"*Bird nesting inside terminal box.

Her accent is so thick and she ends her sentences with \"saeyo\" or \"de\" (like how they sound if they speak korean) that I had a hard time understanding her. Since she only needs the values of her policy I was still able to provide her the service that she needs.

YOU'RE FROM WHERE?? I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU TRANSFER ME TO SOMEONE ELSE. \n\nI kid you not, she started screaming at how she doesn't trust me and to why am I allowed to see her insurance and basically just trying to say that I am a lowly being not worthy of serving her. \n\nWithout missing a beat, I connected her to our case manager's line where we transfer customers who wants to \"speak to someone else.\" Jokes on her because majority of the case managers on this account is located in my country. That's how much the account trusts us, the lowly third world monkeys. \n\n\nTL:DR Korean lady asking for insurance values. Gave info. Ending the call, she asked where I am at. Gave country's name. I am not worthy of her time. Transferred to a case manager that is probaby from the same country as me.",

I tracked the order, and it had been delivered a few weeks ago, to the customer in question.\n\n\n\n\n\"That's strange\", the nurse tells me. \"She said that it was returned to sender, and that she didn't receive a notice\". \"According to the delivery company she signed for it, so there isn't much I can do for you\" I informed her. She thanked me for the service and we ended the call.\n\n\n\n\nCome Wednesday, and my collegue sitting next to me put a call on hold and turned to me. \"It says in the log that you spoke to this customer. What did you tell her?\" I checked the account and I told him that I spoke with her hcp, not her. \"How come?\"\n\n\n\n\nTurns out that yes, she had received the package, signed for it, and then gone on to sending it again to her mother a few towns over. When the mother didn't pick it up it was returned. Since it was our product she demanded that we fix this. We should resend the order since \"it's free anyway\" (people really don't seem to understand that the hospitals are paying A LOT of money for these medical devices, although the patients pay nothing other than taxes for them). She refused to comprehend that the moment the package reaches her, we have done our part and no longer have no responsibility for it. She apparently refused to speak to the delivery company as well, and hung up on my collegue.\n\n\n\nHe (collegue) has been bitter over this all week. He keeps ranting over how stupid the callers are (as do all of us there, but he did bring her up as an example all week.\n\n\n\nSorry for formatting, I'm on mobile.",

Calls weren't going well already, my spirits were low and this left me dumbfounded. I will be ME, supervisor will be SV, and customer will be HG for honest guy. Sorry if the formatting is weird, I'm on mobile.\n\nME: Hello, thanks for calling this company, my name is the_buttbank, \n *rest of opening sequence and security verification* How can I help you today?\n\nHG: Yeah, I was supposed to get my package Friday and now it's Sunday and I still haven't gotten it. I had a guaranteed date. Do you people not know what guaranteed means?\n\nME: Oh, I'm sorry sir! Let me take a look and see what's going on.......unfortunately I see there was a delay at the local carrier facility and we have an updated delivery day for Monday. \n\nHG: No. That's fucking ridiculous, I don't even want the damn thing anymore. I want you to cancel the package and cancel my membership and I want a refund. I have been a customer with you people for years. I have spent thousands of dollars. And this is how you treat me!\n\nME: I completely understand your frustration sir. Let me see what I can do to fix this for you!\n\nHG: No. I don't want you to fix it. I just told you to cancel everything and refund me too.\n\nME: I'm so sorry about this sir! Are you sure you want to cancel your membership? You can reorder the package and we can apply overnight shipping for you free of charge.\n\nHG: NO! Cancel everything! I don't want to do business with you people anymore. \n\nME: Yes, sir. Let me go ahead and take care of that........okay, the package is cancelled and refunded. You should expect the refund in the next 3-5 business days. I can cancel your membership, but unfortunately it looks like you aren't eligible for a refund, so let me place you on a quick hold so I can reach out to a supervisor so they can override that for you.\n\nHG: Yeah, do that.\n\n*reached out to super. Told her what happened. She applied the refund*\n\nME: Thanks for waiting! I went ahead and had my supervisor apply that refund, so just give it a few days and you will see that back on your card.\n\nHG: Wait...you cancelled my membership? Seriously? What the fuck. I didn't really want you to cancel it! What is wrong with you people. I only said that so I could see what I could get from you to get me to stay as a customer. But if you really cancelled it, then you didn't want me as a customer anyways. I want your name and I want to talk to your supervisor now!\n\nME: Uhm....okay......please hold....\n\n*reached out to another supervisor. Let him know what was going on*\n\nSV: So, he asked you to cancel the membership...But then got mad when you actually did what he wanted?\n\nME: That is exactly what happened.\n\nSV: Uhm...okay...go ahead and transfer him. I'm not sure what he wants me to do, but I'll see if I can smooth it over.\n\nTL;DR: instructions unclear. Taking calls sucks. You're never right. Ever. ",

        "text": "Welp... Here's my first story! I'll post a couple of more over the coming weeks. I've worked in customer service for about 3 years now. A couple on the 1st line desks and one on the 2nd line. \n\nIn this particular story, the company i worked for had a 2nd line \" mechanic desk \". Aka... our co-workers from the 1st line would forward a customer through to us if a certain issue could not be fixed by your usually \" have you tried turning it on and off again? \". This ment that the co-worker on the 1st line would have checked the most basic things to rule out easy fixes. They were supposed to only forward calls to us when a mechanic was actually needed or more complex technical issues were the problem. \n\nThe 2nd line was basically there to do the more complicated troubleshoots and as a double check on whether a mechanic was actually needed. I think you can all see where this is going. A couple of months ago the company decided to log how many \" false \" forwards were made by 1st line to our departement. In this case the 1st line co-worker had to give their employee number so we could log in the system how many times a call was false forwarded and which employee kept doing it etc etc. \n\n- Me: Your delicious cheesy bitter ball.\n\n- LC: Lazy Co-worker\n\n- IC: Irate Customer\n\n- While working on a ticket of a tech issue the day before, My phone rings. In our phone system you could see whether it was a 1st line collegeaue calling, the network provider or a customer calling back for an opened ticket. \n\n- Me: CheesyBitterBall speaking, What can i do for you? \n\n- LC: *gives employee number and customer details* Yeah so.... I have this customer who has trouble with his internet. It doesn't work. \n\n- Me: *red flag number one* Okay.... So explain to me... What doesnt work exactly? No line signal? No connection from the router to a device? Wifi issues? What exactly? (in our comapny, wifi issues were NOT a 2nd line issue) \n\n- LC: *ignores my questions completly* LITERALLY starts reading up the entire script of what he's supposed to check with a customer before he puts a customer through to 2nd line for no-signal on the line. *\n\n- Me: *checks customer connection, everything is working perfectly fine. Router has connection with the hub. I see multiple devices connected to the router. And active internet usage.* And how did you check they did not have a signal?\n\n- LC: well i asked the customer to unplug the router from the connection point and did 2 line tests. Both came out as short of the actual distance. \n\n- Me: *checks logs. Nothing of the sort has been done. Last line test had been done 2 years prior and the router has been online for about 70 days non-stop which causes me to red flag this as number two*\n\n- LC: So yeah this customer clearly needs a mechanic because his service doesn't work. Can you take him over now? *red flag number 3* \n\n- Me: Okay... Forward the customer through. Thanks for doing the tests!\n\n- Me: Hello (customer name) What can i help you with today? \n\n- IC: (in a very angry and irate voice) ******** finally! I've been waiting over 20 minutes already! I can't ******* play game X right because i always have over 200ms! You ***** ** need to fix my connection right NOW! I should be having 10ms! \n\n- Me: *already hugging the mute button and facedesking* Okay just to make sure..... What game exactly are you playing and do you have these issues with any other game as well? \n\n- IC: Its game xxx (hosted in the US, Sidenote: customer and us are located in the EU. A good 9000KM away from the server host) I never have this ******* problem with anything else so it must be something on your end! \n\n- Me: Well sir, i'm sorry but i can't fix this for you. Your connection is working perfectly and the issue you have right now is purely due to the factor that the game is being hosted on a server on the other side of the world. I literally can't do anything about that. \n\n- IC: ***** you! Your co-worker told me you'd send somebody over to fix my internet! You probaly don't even know how this works do you?! I'm going to write a complaint to your headoffice and get you fired! \n\nAt this point i just told the customer to have a good day and disconnected the call. Afterwards i just started writing a notation on the customer profile explaining the conversation and that we can't help this customer with this specific problem.\n\nSadly this ended up being a recurring problem. Once a customers issue appeared to be \" outside the script \" or if the customer was angry or unreasonable..... Our 1st line co-workers would just end up forwarding the call to us and reading the script to us. Our departement had a law that we HAD to accept all calls from 1st line no matter the doubts. \n\nAfter about a month or two of this.... we ended up with about 75% wrongfully forwarded calls from 1st line per day for either the wrong checks or just absolute bullshit reasons. This was about 200-300 calls a day on a team of about 20 people who also did all refund requests and other escelations. If you refused a call you'd get written up by your team leader for not following call centre rules. I'm genuinly glad that stint was over! I quit after 6 months and about half of the 20 man team quit as well.  \n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "I work in a call center for a utility company. I’m glad to say that 95% of my daily interactions are neutral or pleasant. Of course, there is that other 5%!\n\nLast week sometime a customer (We will call him BB for Big Baby) called in because he was moving that day. We schedule all of our service transfers out 2 days in advance, but in most cases utilities are on, we just have to read their meter to start the billing. So we let BB know it will be a couple days and he FLIPS THE FREAK OUT. Now keep in mind, his utilities are already on, he won’t have to meet anyone out there, it’s literally a simple meter read. So he starts calling the CSR he was speaking with a bunch of names, tells her to do her effing job and hangs up. \n\nThis fool ended up calling back and bouncing around our call center 8 different times that day until a supervisor finally gave him what he wanted...(and the rest of us CSRs rolled our eyes). \n\nSo fast forward a week I get a call from a man  (who I only figure out was BB after our conversation). He was confused about his balance that our phone system gave him because it didn’t match his bill. I let him know that because he transferred service, the account is in the middle of some adjustments, and to go ahead and pay the amount his bill stated. I thought that would have resolved the matter, but out of nowhere this guy starts freaking CRYING! What!!!! \n\nSo I assure him again he doesn’t have to pay the $300 and he starts whining and then yelling at me! BB told me that I don’t make any sense, I’m a two faced dumb b*tch and demands to speak with a supervisor. When I tried to explain that I would get him transferred he started screaming/chanting...I kid you not...”SUPERVISOR SUPERVISOR SUPERVISOR!!”\n\nAt this point I’m pissed. I said to him, “Sir, if you are screaming at us and using profanity we cannot and will not help you. I’m not going to transfer you unless you stop.” To which he replied, “I can say whatever the f**k I want, please transfer me now.”\n\nDespite my will to hang up on him, I transferred him to a supervisor who ended up hanging up on him anyways since he was screaming profanity at her.\n\nMoral of the story...these people need to grow up and handle their business like adults! No one in the real world is going to help you if you act like that.",

Obviously I cannot type out how it sounded but I can promise that something was very strange in his voice. \n\nThe main reason I came here to post this is because the words he used to explain the situation were very strange, maybe I’am paranoid but, when he said “I don’t know what to do”, that would imply he is alone or had no else to ask, which leads to his “girlfriend” being unresponsive and was never able to ask her what she would do or how she feels and in that case call 911 people!! As for someone who has definitely lied in life and learned to tell my dad back in the day that “I” went to the store, not “we”, as in I picked up a friend to drive around with me when I was not supposed to, That one word difference “I”, “we” can really change a story. You don’t just say “I” when your with someone that you’re talking about whether you realize it or not. \nI’am sure I’am nuts and over blowing it, thinking this guy did something to her on Valentine’s Day but I can’t help to think what happened in the end. \n\nMoral of the story, call 911 if you have any doubt someone’s life could be in danger, and don’t kill your loved one or anyone for that matter. \n\n\n",

        "text": "LTL FTP apologies for shitty spelling and sorry if this is in the wrong place.  \n\nSorry this is long. \n\nI work for a national crisis line that focuses on very specific demographic of people. Anyways, I have some really great coworkers. I would say we have a very colorful group from all walks of life. The spacifc cowork in this tale is awesome. She happens to be my  deskmate. This is her first job out of college in social and health services and her past work includes a round of deployments in the Army. This is relevant because she can come off a little strong and when dealing with people \"in crisis\" and can catch you off guard. We are always trained to meet the caller where they are (vocabulary, tone of voice things like that). \n\nAll of this is heard from one desk over in a smaller call center environment. We will call coworker E and caller SLF for stupid little fuck. \n\nAt the start of this call I'm not paying much attention.  You hear E answer the phone \"Thank you for calling  the (insert crisis line here). This is E. How can I help you?\"\n\nAt this point I hear very loud screams coming from her headset and a panicked look on her face. E starts to reflect back some of the things SLF is saying. \"It hurts so bad\", \"I can't stop the bleeding\", \"I just want to die\"... E at this point has jumped into locating the callers phone number and running it to find a location to send 911. By this time it's not just me who has started following call but other coworkers and supervisors. Call goes on for a few more minutes. We get a location and E informs the caller we are gonna sent EMTs to his location and ask what does he see around him. I think that must has been an 'OH SHIT' moment because the caller disconnected the call. E jumps back on the phone and calls back. The kid answers and is laughing that this was all a joke and he is fine and then swears at her and hangs up. \n\nThis is when E stands up and officially names him Stupid Little Fuck loudly and can be heard across the office. These calls happen frequently some not no elaborate but this time E isn't having it. She is pissed. This kid thinks he can just call up spew some shit and hang up. After doing some more digging she finds this kids Facebook. She now knows his friends who he is hanging out with at that moment because they just tagged him in a post, the school he goes to, his dogs name and his parents info along with a lot of other info. \n\nE take a deep breath and calls SLF back. He answers the phone \"what the fuck do you want\". E responds with a \"What the fuck do you think I want (kids name). You just told me you were going to kill yourself,  you were hurting so bad and couldn't stop bleeding. Do you think (enters friends who just tagged him in a post) would think it's cool to prank a suicide hotline. Or what about  (enters parents names) would feel to know there son is taking up someones time that should be saving someone else's live but is dealing with SLF prank calling her. E went on to talk about his school and about how she was so worried about him that 911 was on their way and \"oh wait is the sirens I hear in the background\". Now I don't know if there really were sirens but that stupid little kid sucked up into a babbling little baby and cried about how sorry he was.\n\nAnd E went home feeling very sure that SLF won't be pranking our CL anytime soon.\n\nNeedless to say these lines are here to help people who need help and there is a chance if you are pranking a line, you are stopping someone who really might need their life saved from getting through. \n\nAlso just because it says confidential does not mean anonymous. I wish prankers realised the amount of personal information they leave behind in just a call.\n\nTLDR stupid kid pranks a crisis line and gets the shit scared out of him.",

She properly requests that I ask her client if it would be okay if she called him back.\n\nThe client replies: How long is that gunna take, a week?\n\nI replied: No sir, we close at nine P.M. so a week is doubtful.\n\nThe client: .... What does that mean?\n\nMe: Sir, she will contact you in about ten minutes or so as soon as she exits the call she is currently on.\n\nThe Client: ...oh...okay...(click).\n",

For those who don't know, I work as a tier 2 agent for an ISP. Immediately when calling this Irate Customer (IC) I knew it was going to be an adventure.\n\n\nIC: Hello?\n\n\nMe: *intro* I'm calling about the phone issue you've reported.\n\n\nIC: Oh yes! My phone is not working at all.\n\n\nMe: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. If I may ask, how are you speaking to me right now?\n\n\nIC: On my phone.\n\n\nMe: ...\n\n\nIC: ...\n\n\nMe: But, if you're speaking to me on your home phone, that would mean the phone is working?\n\n\nIC: *loudly* But it's not!!!\n\n\nMe: Okay, so what is exactly is the issue with your phone?\n\n\nIC: *loudly* It's just not working!\n\n\nMe: IC, your phone is working because you're speaking to me on it right now. If it's a calling feature or something to do with your phone itself, I can assist you if you can be more specific. Could you be more specific?\n\n\nIC: This is ridiculous! How much more specific do I need to be?! My phone is not working!!\n\n\nMe: *facedesk* I apologize but I am unable to assist you because ~~you're a moron~~ I am unsure of what the issue is. \n\n\nIC: I told you the issue! My phone is not working!!! *string of profanity*\n\n\nMe: Your phone is working fine. Have a good day, IC and thank you for choosing ISP. *click*\n\n\nI have a headache.",

Recently, we've been pushing our live TV streaming.\n\nI had a trainee sitting with me last week, I was pitching streaming, one of the questions we're supposed to ask is, \"What sort of shows do you like to watch?\" this is to encourage them to tell us channels they like so we can make suggestions for packages.\n\nThis guy, probably in his 20's, tells me he likes to watch \"nasty grandma porn, with the bigger the balls the better. And more sweat the better.\" I stuttered a second, and then said, \"Well sir, that's not the kind of service we provide, but I'm sure you're aware of that. However, what type of television shows do you watch normally? Do you use streaming services like Netflix or Hulu?\". He giggled at me and hung up.\n\nMy poor trainee was so confused. It was a 16 year old kid I was training. I wish people would realize that a lot of high school kids work in call centers as their first jobs and don't need this crap.\n\nAnd this isn't the first time I've had someone tell me their porn preferences..
