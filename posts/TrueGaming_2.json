        "text": "I love achievements in games, but it feels like people care less about achievements these days. What are your thoughts on achievements? What do you think developers can do to make achievements relevant for players who aren't completionists? I feel that they have the potential to be more than just a dopamine hit.\n\nFor example, I find mechanics based achievements to be valuable, because they can teach you things about the game you may have missed, or help you better understand something. In my playthrough of Jedi: Fallen Order, I noticed that the achievement that requires 100 precision evades has a progress tracker on it, and the progress counter was not increasing. It turns out I was doing the evade incorrectly- what I thought was a precision evade was actually just a regular dodge. The achievement actually helped me improve, much like how a personal trainer might comment on your form at the gym.\n\nAnother achievement I was going for involved defeating enemies with explosives. This involved me reflecting a lot of bombs back at enemies, which is something I wasn’t doing during normal gameplay. After practicing for this achievement, I ended up integrating the bomb reflect into my regular playstyle even after the achievement was finished. So achievements used in this way can really make you appreciate the game more if you go for them.\n\nNot all achievements are desirable. For example, I feel missable achievements should be removed or reworked. In The Witcher 2, there's 2 achievements related to trolls- 1 for slaying all of them, and 1 for helping all of them, and it can theoretically be fun to compare with friends to see which path was taken. But for people looking for 100 percent completion, all these achievements do is cause stress, and reduce enjoyment.\n\nI’ll continue with The Witcher 2 as an example. The Witcher 2 is a fantastic game. But on my first playthrough, I made the terrible mistake of saying “Yeah, I’ll go for all achievements. Let me just reference a guide to make sure I don’t miss any.” But as I played on, I came to realize The Witcher 2 has 34 MISSABLE ACHIEVEMENTS. Out of 50. So what happened? Well, after the first few hours, I realized I wasn’t having any fun. My eyes were glued to the guide, because I had to pick up every item exactly as needed, talk to everyone exactly as needed, kill the right people, befriend the right people, or I would miss a future achievement.\n\nThe main issue is that several of these missable achievements resolve after hours and hours of gameplay. Going back to the troll example, you can’t just kill the troll, get the achievement, and reload your save. No, there are 3 trolls spread throughout the entire playthrough, and in one playthrough you have to kill all three, the other playthrough you have to solve their problems. There are several achievements like that in The Witcher 2 requiring hours of setup and a guide. I understand what the game is doing, and why it is the way it is, and again, I think it’s a great game. But let me offer two alternatives from other games that do it better.\n\nFirst alternative- leave the choices in the game, but take the missable achievements out. In Telltale's walking dead, you have some surface level choices you have to make that can influence relationships. But the achievements given are pure story based achievements and not missable. Instead, the game puts alternate paths into a nice little end screen for you to share with friends and compare to others around the world. The witcher 2 could have done something similar to this for the major decisions, like Iorvith.\n\nSecond alternative- keep the missable achievements, but implement a better chapter select system. In Inscryption, there are quite a few missable achievements. But once you’ve beaten the game, you’re able to go back to any chapter you played before, and getting any missable achievement takes no more than 30 minutes. The Witcher could have had some sort of system like that, where you can go to the start of any chapter, and maybe even check off some boxes for things you had done before.\n\nThis video provides visuals and examples of good achievement design, such as emergent gameplay achievements, and bad achievement design like grinding and FOMO achievements. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/npGvqKlbU8s",

        "text": "I love achievements in games, but it feels like people care less about achievements these days. What are your thoughts on achievements?\n\nFor the purpose of discussion, I've split up achievement types into 10 categories. Some achievements can fit into multiple categories but I think each type warrants a unique discussion. \n\n**Type 1- Progress achievements**\n\nThese can’t be missed, and are basically checkpoints. They’re the only type of achievements that function more as data collection than a flex. \n\n**Type 2- Hidden Lore achievements**\n\nThese are achievements that don’t usually require skill to pull off, but lead to an easter egg, or secret interaction that lets you learn more about the world. \n\n**Type 3- Mechanics achievements**\n\nDevelopers put these in games to get people to experiment with systems. \n\n**Type 4- Emergent Gameplay achievements**\n\nAn achievement that creates a game within a game, and makes you do something you would never do otherwise. \n\n**Type 5- Skill based achievements**\n\nDifficult achievements that test your skill, and push the limits of game mechanics.\n\n\n**Type 6- Stat grind achievements**\n\nAchievements that can take up a lot of time, and can either be fun reminders of how much you’ve come, or horrible slogs.\n\n**Type 7- Completionist achievements**\n\nFor these, you must comb every inch of the map, or do everything there is to do.\n\n**Type 8- Missable achievements**\n\nAn achievement where, if you didn’t get it the first time around, you’ll have to start a new game. \n\n**Type 9-DLC achievements**\n\nAchievements that come packaged with a game update- sometimes one that you have to pay for.\n\n**Type 10- Limited time achievements**\n\nThese are achievements that were available, but are now unobtainable for one reason or another.\n\nPersonally, I'm a big fan of Type 3, because they can teach you things about the game you may have missed, or help you better understand something. For example, in my playthrough of Jedi: Fallen Order, I noticed that the achievement that requires 100 precision evades has a progress tracker on it, and the progress counter was not increasing. It turns out I was doing the evade incorrectly- what I thought was a precision evade was actually just a regular dodge.

After practicing for this achievement, I ended up integrating the bomb reflect into my regular playstyle even after the achievement was finished. So mechanics achievements can really make you appreciate the game more if you go for them. And that’s why I feel they should have a spot in ANY game’s achievement list.   \n\nAs for an achievement I could do without, Type 8 is a strong contender. Even though missable achievements are so commonly accepted in games, they are among the worst of all achievement types in my opinion. Missable achievements are, on paper, similar to grind achievements in that you are meant to share them with friends. For example, in The Witcher 2, there's 2 achievements related to trolls- 1 for slaying all of them, and 1 for helping all of them, and it can theoretically be fun to compare with friends to see which path was taken. But for people looking for 100 percent completion, all these achievements do is cause stress, and reduce enjoyment. \n\nI’ll continue with The Witcher 2 as an example.

It also discusses solutions for certain achievement problems-- like when DLC achievements remove the 100 percent \"Blue Ribbon\" status from your steam account.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/npGvqKlbU8s",

There's a moment when one of the men who have pursued the wanderer say \"He's possessed by the spirits of the dead!\" It's not just the possession that's an issue, and its not the possession by Dormin (which happens moment later) that's the problem, it's that it's the spirits of the dead that are possessing him, causing things to be worse.  \n\nIn Lightning Returns, the big bad, Bhunivelze says that he must destroy the new world he was going to bring the living into because Lightning freed all the \"impure\" souls of the dead and they would also inhabit his new, perfect world.  \n\nDuring Lightning Returns my wife, who does Japanese studies, said something along the lines of \"This is so Japanese,\" in the way that the souls of the dead, by virtue of them being dead, are unclean.  There's a huge taboo around the handling of death in Japan, where traditionally, undertakers, butchers, leather workers, and that such were in some cases literally untouchable.  (You can look up the term Kegare for more information - basically, interacting with the dead leaves a form of spiritual pollution that can be cleansed, but will cause harm if left.  The 2008 film Departures is not a bad place to look for more information as well.)  \n\nWith all that background given, I was wondering, does this show up in other Japanese video games?  I imagine it probably does, given the cultural background, but I do not know many outside of the major releases in the United States, and even then, not all of them (I know nothing of the Silent Hill games).  \n\nSome games that I thought might, but don't seem to/I don't know: The Resident Evil games, the zombies/infected with the T-virus/whatever else seems more to pull from the American zombie tropes than anything around the dead.  Fatal Frame (at least 1 and 2, I don't know the later ones) has both hostile and benign/helpful ghosts, being dead does not give them spiritual pollution.  I was never good enough at Castlevania (and never played the later games), so I don't know if this comes up, although the fact that death itself is a boss in many of the games seems to give at least some credence to the idea.\n\nAnyway, is this something that others have seen in Japanese video games, or are these two (and a half for Castlevania) the sole examples?",

It might be really small games that has less than a thousand reviews but that still stick with you.\n\nWith that said, I'd like to mention a small game called Near Death. If you like survival games but don't like how they're aimless, too resource focused and includes base building, then this is for you. It has the briefness of an PS1 Resident Evil game, the art style (and a lot of the gameplay) of a PS2 first person puzzle game. It really puts gameplay first, having no voice acting (as far as I remember) or cutscenes. \n\nThe only real negative I can say is that the dialogue with your \"home base\" is not good. It feels like it was written for a teen drama. \n\nOn the other hand, the soundtrack! Wow, I don't know much about music but I think whoever did the music must have been a fan because it feels like it belongs to a game with a bigger budget. Seriously, just listen to one of the songs when it is dark.\n\nFor me, this game was similar to a great standalone episode of TV (maybe in an anthology series) or a short novel. I don't think those games could have been profitable for a very long time until now with game development being more accessable than ever and several store platforms being open for self-publishing. And I like it. Do you know of any such small game that has stuck with you?",

In the last years I've seen a fan getting into debt to buy a lifesize Pokèmon plush and getting another one as soon as he paid the last installment for it, another one buying 10+ copies of the same exact plush not to resell it but just to make a pile and another one which kept buying plushies despite being unemployed and already having slightly different plushies of the same species... these of course are most extreme examples but in general I noticed how hoarding expensive merchandise is becoming the norm amongst Pokèmon fans. In early 2010s having a room dedicated to Pokèmon merch or buying 500$+ life size plushies was considered very extravagant even within Pokèmon communities but now it's becoming almost the norm. \n\nOnline Pokèmon communities used to be places where fans talked about games, movies and episodes but now they're switching to places where to flex copious amounts of merchandise. I think I understand why this is happening: in part we have a main series of games whose quality is in sharp decline, console spin off games being replaced with apps which have far less charisma and decreasing investment into movies (let's be honest they never were Studio Ghibli tier masterpieces but once movies brought the fans together and got a lot of discussion into dedicated communities while the last movies were so generic, derivative and badly promoted which were ignored by most fans too) on the other hand we have simply grown up and consequently found out which these games aren't so difficult when played with adult brain/knowledge and that the movie plot twist which were sooo cool and unexpected when we were 8 now at 20+ are very predictable. Most people given these fact leaves the franchise or tries to find new and more mature ways to enjoy Pokèmon (in my case playing TCG tournaments at the local league and considering to get into cosplay) but others seems which they cannot let their childhood go and try to keep it artificially alive by continuously buying stuff.",

        "text": "**Background**\n\nSo I'm not really an HP fan. I think I only binged all of the movies in one go last year because I heard this game was coming out. I liked the movies but I didn't really watch all of them during the time they came out so the impact is much different. And even after watching the movies, I am still not a huge fan of HP. Don't get me wrong, I liked them, I just don't LOVE them. Which also means I am not too picky when it comes to the little trivial details of the wizarding world and all of it's lore.\n\n**Combat**\n\nSo let's start off with combat right? The main complaint about it on this sub is that it is far too easy. And I can definitely see why. I actually started in normal and switched it up to hard because I could tell early on that it wouldn't provide me with a challenge otherwise.\n\nThe window of recovery from each move is so short that often times the enemy can not take advantage of it. It is very easy to counter a move with Stupefy when trying because you get the flashing orange symbol. And it's easy to tell when to dodge because of the red symbol. I will admit though, there are some attacks that I did get hit by quite a bit because they didn't have those signs. Specifically the AOE from executioners and dig attack from spiders. And occasionally goblins will have this really fast attack that gets me quite a bit. Like I would see orange, thinking I had enough time to time a perfect protego, but I end up missing it. But for the most part the mechanics are fairly simple and execution isn't too hard\n\nThis of course doesn't even take into the account of all the boons and benefits the player receives. Here are some of the big ones:\n\n1. Can heal whenever. It doesn't matter if you get 2-3 shot in hard mode, you can click on that healing potion whenever, even when you are knocked to the ground.\n2. Last hit invincibility. If you have some segment of health, if the next move kills you, you survive by 1hp. I don't know how this mechanic works, but I know I've encountered it quite a bit\n3. You can summon plants to fight for you\n4. Eradus potion gives you invincibility if you get the talent for it\n\nIf you pull out every trick in your book, it's very hard for the enemy to kill you. I ended up avoiding using anything but my spells, dodging and protego for the most part to make it challenging for myself. I try to avoid potions and plants. I even avoided using the ancient magic blast usually. I still use ancient magic throw though. The only times I had to go all out with plants, potions, etc was when I fought the two combat trials and that giant lvl 30 spider at lvl 22. I think even with Erudus invincibility, the spider bite still took 3/4 of my health iirc\n\nI've seen people make the same remark as I have about combat and sometimes the people who would respond with \"just don't use this thing or that\". Which is essentially what I did however, the people complaining about combat being too easy isn't wrong either. The thing is that we as players shouldn't have to hamstrung ourselves for combat to be challenging. What people are asking for is a higher difficulty or a NG+ and all of that is a fairly reasonable ask and pretty easy to do as well.\n\n**Spells and Pacing**\n\nDespite combat being generally simple and easy, it is still fun and engaging to cast spells. Especially when you get into the flow of defending and combing someone with CC spells. I did find myself switching from various spell slots quite a bit.\n\nHowever one huge gripe I have with this game is that this game presents you with spells as you go along the story. Now I know that SOUNDS pretty normal, but you don't even get AK until near the end of the game. By which point, I didn't have as much use for it since I was nearing the end anyways. I think part of the reason for that as well was because I did end up doing a lot of activities in the open world already. So I wasn't just almost done with the main game, but I was pretty much almost done with the side stories as well. The other unforgivables also come in a bit later as well.\n\nI do get it though. They paced the accessibility of the spells along with the storyline so that there is a 1:1 coherency between story and actual gameplay\n\n**More Cinematic Than I'd Like**\n\nAnd to continue from the above, I think they did this because the game seemed to really focus on being a more cinematic experience (for a lack of a better term). It seemed like they care less about the gamer and more about the story of Hogwarts. Take my example above about the Unforgivable spells. And then also take into consideration this is true for Flipendo, Arresto Momentum, etc as well. They really wanted to make the player feel like a student. That seemed to be their goal and they did achieve it.\n\nHowever the gamer in me hates this as it felt too restrictive and these restrictions are with you until most of the game.\n\nAnother example of this is that at least at the beginning and end of the game, most of it is cutscenes. I spent a whole time at the beginning wondering when I would get to play. And the end was a sequence chain of cutscenes before I got to do any real action. And then when I did, it was more cutscenes again\n\n**Open World - Engagement**\n\nI thought the open world was very engaging for someone like me. There were a lot of activities like bandit camps, Merlin trials, dungeons, beast hunting, treasure chest etc. I found myself doing pit stops in between when I travel to another place for a mission just so engage with these little things. And honestly sometimes I would just lose track of time doing it. I honestly spent about 7-10 hours just in Hogwarts at the beginning finding all of these little things.\n\nI love that there does seem to be a lot of depth to the map. Treasure dungeons are short and linear. But the houses and building seems to have depth. Hogwarts has depth. Castle locations seems to have depth. Could there have been more depth? Sure, but this was good enough. I also liked that there was minimal decorated stuff. If you see a location you can go to it and go inside of it for the most part.\n\n**Open World - Repetition**\n\nThe open world does have a lot of activities to do, but they often get repetitive. Sure there are various Merlin trials and different ways to open the treasure dungeons, but after a few hours in it's pretty trivial. The only time consuming part for the Merlin trials was finding where the intractables are. The same is said of the butterfly portraits and math quiz puzzles. It's kinda cool the first few times, but afterwards it suffers the same fate as every other puzzle. Depulso puzzles were interesting, but that was probably why there weren't more of them, because to make each one unique enough and challenging enough takes effort.\n\nI generally hate grinding, but I do still have a forgiving spot for various exploration activities such as these. It's not worse than most open world games in that regard. However, if I think back to the Arkham series, specifically starting for city, I recall that while that game also had a lot of activities and collectibles, they implemented it in such a way that a lot of them were uniquely engaging. But that could be just rose tinted lens\n\n**Open World - Traversal And Mounts**\n\nI do love flying on a broom, that's fun and it's about as fun as I thought it would be. I do have gripes with it though. Sometimes I am trying to find something a broom and I want to look down, but I can't This game decided to give your character a blind spot at the bottom of them which makes absolutely no sense to me. I can think of a good gameplay reason for it whatsoever. It just seemed like it was missed.\n\nLater on you do get to ride a Griffon and the Graphorn. And they are kinda cool. But you aren't likely to use them over your broom most of the time. Or rather at least I wouldn't. When it comes to speed of traversal, broom is king. There is really no reason to use the Griffon at all. And the Graphorn has to take a non-direct route from A-Z because it is on land. It's cool the first time you use them, but they almost seem pointless when you get them outside of aesthetics at the cost of speed and flexibility.\n\n**Choices Matter Very Little**\n\nI think when I saw that there were dialogue options, the first thing I thought of was Elder Scrolls and Fallout. And I thought that a lot of the choices that I made would matter. A lot of them did not. The storylines are fairly straightforward and you don't really have much of an option to go evil. At most you get an ending that alludes you to maybe become evil in the future. You can probably respond in a way that makes you sound like an asshole but that's it. You can turn down quests or take on quests but that's it.\n\nOnly a few times do you get to make a choice like in the Sebastian storyline. A lot of people say it's the more compelling storyline even when compared to the main story. But if I am being honest, while that might be true in Hogwarts Legacy, that is most certainly not true when I compare it to games like Skyrim or Fallout 4.\n\nSo I get it, the developers didn't have that in mind and I made an assumption based on a similar UI regarding dialogue.\n\n**Side Quests - Flat and Lack Of Choice**\n\nContinuing from what I just mentioned above, the side quests are mostly bland. There isn't a lot of follow up in those quests and the online quest lines outside of the main one are the 3 companion quests. Additionally most side quests are one and done. There often isn't too many follow ups to it if any.\n\nIf I am comparing it to open world games like Fallout 4 and Skyrim, with many different quests lines it does seem kind of sparse. Additionally, there isn't a lot of choice in these one off quests. The most I've seen is that you get to choose to relay the truth of the results to the quest giver or lie to them to spare their feelings in front of you.\n\n**Potions and Planting**\n\nSo we get to do these things at scale in this lab known as the Room of Requirements. And you know what, it's kind of a chore. At first I was kinda pissed because I had all of these ingredients and it actually TOOK TIME to plant stuff and to brew stuff. At the beginning, this is going to feel insane. And there doesn't seem to be a rhyme or reason to it outside of them trying to be immersive without understanding being immersive. They took an anti-pattern from money grabbing mobile games and don't even have the monetization part in place (not that I'm complaining). But there is no reason to this.\n\nI have seen people make the argument of just come back to the game later. And to me that's about as stupid of a response as needing to nerf yourself to make the game more challenging for you. Like yea we know what we need to do to accommodate for the system, but what we are saying is that there is a very obvious quality of life change that is very much needed here.\n\nLater on as you get money, that becomes less of a burden as you will have a lot of tables for planting and potions. I would end up brewing my potions with the highest time at the first table and slowly go around. Then come back to the beginning to see if it is done. I personally didn't have issues with the plants and potions later on in the game because I ended up avoiding usage of them anyways.\n\n**Beasts**\n\nAs for the beasts, they were okay. I liked to have them for materials for upgrading my equipment, but like the potions and the plants, they were more of a chore than they were worth. You can't do anything with your beasts besides feed them and brush their hair. Each of which is a one button activity with lack lustered animation. You can breed them too. Wooooooooooooo\\~\\~...\n\n**What I Thought It Did Well**\n\nDespite my many complaints, I thought the game was good for what it was. It was a pretty faithful HP game. It's open world wasn't bland and had depth to it. It's combat was on the easy side, but still engaging and fun. While it certainly has a lot of flaws, the overall tradeoff of what it succeeds with is pretty positive.\n\n**Endgame**\n\nAside from a few minor post game quests, there isn't anything. We don't know if there will be a DLC or not. I think someone linked to something saying there wouldn't be. Basically end game is mostly open world stuff you haven't done yet. Side quests, Merlin Trials, Treasure Dungeons (really a small tunnel and not dungeon), capture more beasts, Astronomy table, etc. The most compelling stuff is probably the combat trials. But I think I only found 2 of them and I feel like there should be more but for some reason I didn't see any of them?",

I held the game in my heart but had decided to avoid all media about it. This was because I planned on coming back a few years later. When I rebooted the game and started through Kings Pass , I realized I still remembered almost everything about the game despite having avoided it for almost two years.

        "text": "I have no idea how anyone enjoys fromsoft or any of their completely dogshit games. I've beaten all the bosses in Sekiro, and not once did I get an ounce of enjoyment from the game. It's just irritating nonsense followed by more irritating nonsense. Hyper-precise timing is not fun. Having dodges mean nothing is not fun. Getting punished for healing is not fun. Losing all your progress is not fun. Having mob enemies with insane range and high health is not fun. Having bosses that have 40x the health you do and instakill you in 2 hits is not fun. Anyone who says that shit is fun is coping incredibly hard. Fighting a hard boss, just to get hit with a 2nd or 3rd phase is not fun. Getting pushed up against a wall, staggered because of a melee hit, and then unable to move or roll out of the way to recover b/c the boss keeps wailing on you is not fun. Having bosses do insane AOE and have an immense reach that's still smaller than the average from soft fan's overinflated ego is not fun. Having 2-3 seconds input delay/queing mechanism is not fun. Having no ability to cancel a move is not fun.\n\nOf course, fromsoft will never improve any of this because its legion of retarded online white knights are there to protect it with the battle cry \"git gud\". Their precious Fromshit games can never have any problems. The dumbest excuse I've heard for how comically bad these games are is \"oh well the game is about overcoming the impossible!!!1!1!1!!\" It's a fucking video game bro. I play video games to have fun.\n\nRight now im fighting the most ridiculous boss in existence.  Whoever designed this boss is fucking retarded. This is the most ridiculous boss ive ever seen.\n\nHe has insane HP, does insane damage, is so quick that if you're a melee user you have no time to hit him or use a skill that requires 2 seconds of charge up. You can't heal because the arena is fucking tiny and any move he does immediately hits you. He has the most retarded moveset in existence none of which can be avoided. His stupid antigrav bullshit cant be rolled out of the way and cant be defended. you cant rely on blocking because he has a 4 hit combo move that depletes all of it and he follows up with a charge.\n\nAnd of course, he is placed in the most retarded location in existence. No grace anywhere, so you have to trudge through 40 enemies all of which deplete 2-3 flasks just to get back to him. And my runes are stuck in there, so i have to fight him.\n\nIf I had to choose a game that did difficulty well, it was God of War. You get hit with mob enemies that are tough, do high damage, and have high health. I beat the game including all Valks on GMGOW. It was a fun experience. It relied on hyper precise timing, but there was no bullshit. A heal is instant, and if the enemy was near you, it staggered them. The game allows you to fucking heal, it doesnt punish you for it. Even if a boss had a difficult moveset, there was no input delay/queing. if you needed a moment to breathe, your shield would block most moves aside from special ones. Moves can still instakill you in 1-2 hits, but it was fair. There's no constant 5 move combo like there is Shitsouls games. **You can actually cancel your fucking moves as it should be**. You don't lose all your progress when you die. If you whittled down a boss far enough, you didn't have to start all the way from the very fucking beginning.",

        "text": "Spoilers for *Disco Elysium* and *Persona 3*, both of which are great games and I recommend to all.\n\nI can’t recall any point in my entire life where I’ve cried at a game (or any media, for that matter). The closest I have ever gotten was the ending of *Disco Elysium*.\n\nI know I’m not alone in this, but I can’t help but feel disconnected when I look on forums and see everyone going “you’ll need a box of tissues” or “prepare to have your heart ripped out” etc. I obviously *feel* sad, and I often get goosebumps during particularly emotionally charged scenes, but never anything more. The effect also wears off real quick. Like, five minutes after the scene, I’ll forget how I even felt during the moment.\n\nI only ask this because I recently beat *Persona 3* (as in 2 hours ago). At that games ending &gt;!your player character dies!&lt;. Yet I felt nothing. Not even during the credits. In fact, I only felt so much as a tinge of sadness when I decided to watch it again. I connected to the games themes, loved the characters, thoroughly enjoyed the gameplay and more, yet I didn’t cry or really feel anything during the credits. I think it’s worth mentioning that I did feel sad and have a pit in my stomach at the climax of the game (which comes shortly before the ending), as well as several other points in the story. I think it may be because the &gt;!player character!&lt; themselves don’t really have any personality, but this is besides the point.\n\nOf course, once I looked online, I saw an endless supply of people proclaiming that they cried at ending, and I felt quite jealous and confused on why I didn’t really feel anything. Maybe I misunderstood the metaphors of the game, and couldn’t appreciate the ending? Maybe I hadn’t connected to the world and characters as much as I thought? I don’t know.\n\n*Disco Elysium* is different, as I felt “satisfied” with how I felt during the credits (if that makes sense), whereas with *Persona 3* I feel disappointed that despite enjoying the game so much, I feel very little upon finishing it. However, the perpetual struggle of Harrier Du Bois against himself is almost impossible for me to relate to, which makes me wonder why I was able to feel so much more emotional during that game than I did *Persona 3*. \n\nI have to admit that this is a point of insecurity for me. It makes me consider my ability to connect with characters and other people, and forge my own opinions and feelings towards things. I *feel* like I should be sad, so I try to force myself to be.\n\nSo, what is everybody else’s thoughts on this?   \n\nTLDR: I don’t get emotional at games, despite wanting to.",

        "text": "It feels as if most fighting games have an off level of stiffness compared to others, whether it just be animationwise or inputting attacks. Two examples I have in mind are JJBA: All Star Battle vs JJBA: HFTF, where I feel as JJBA: ASB is stiffer than JJBA: HFTF.\n\n I've played through both games, and each are equally as fun, though JJBA: ASB feels sticky and heavy, even with some of the more lightweight characters. Running isn't as effective, as it's reduced to a dash move than actual running, and some characters can have huge advantages depending on their playstyle and enemy. JJBA: ASB is still wonderful though, especially when the fighting is in your favor, or you are able to utilize it best.\n\nJJBA: HFTF is on the opposite end of the spectrum in my opinion, being smaller but smoother in nature. Attacks feel deserved when executed correctly instead of just mashing a combo button, and combos especially feel heavenly when done adequately. An issue with it is that it has a steep learning curve, but overall feels nicer. Not only this, but each character feels like they all work similarly, which makes for much more even fights.\n\nI'm not sure how to put it into words, but it feels like one is more grimer than the other, and I wanted to see if you guys knew why.",

        "text": "With all the hype around AI generated art, AI generated music, AI generated text, etc, one topic seems to be absent: AI in videogames. \n\nThe reason I was thinking about it, is that AI in my favourite games right now isn't great. For instance, the hard AI in Command &amp; Conquer games is hard because it cheats: it can build buildings for free, starts out with more cash than you and has a zero second building time. It's set to build a specific number of buildings, pump out specific units and that's it. But it doesn't react dynamically to the player. It would be much better if it could see I have a lot of, say, ground defences, to switch tactics and start attacking from the air. \n\nSame with bots in shooters. In Quake 3, the bots know where you are at all times because they have access to your location. They just follow you across the map. They don't enter a room, see I'm not there and try another room, building an idea of where I am organically.\n\nSo I am wondering, where are we on that front? How hard is it to make a self-learning bot in games? Has anyone tried it? What are the results?",

        "text": "I came to this realization after watching the latest Suicide Squad gameplay trailer. I was expecting a single player game with some inspirations from the good old Arkham games, but then they showed the game's destiny like menu with item rarity, etc, and I thought: \"Oh, ok. It's one more GaaS game.\" Not to mention the battle pass (since when battle pass became a game feature? smh) \n\nDon't get me wrong. I have thousand of hours of Destiny 1 and 2 combined. I love the game and have only good memories of it. However I can't stop but think Destiny created this game as a service trend, and doomed us all.\n\nGame companies keep trying to replicate Destiny sole success as game as a service business model. And they keep failing miserably. We have a few examples:\n\nAnthem \nMarvel's Avengers\nBabylon's Fall\n\nNow I'm afraid the new Suicide Squad game might head to the same direction. Not that I was very hyped for the game, it's just that I didn't expect it to head to GaaS path, and worst, they didn't need to. When this GaaS trens started I actually liked it. I thought it would mean more games like Destiny and that's what I wanted, years later I can only see failed projects with anti customer practices (micro transactions, loot boxes, etc.)\n\nThat's it. Destiny has helped to put game industry in its current situation. Do you agree? Do you think game as a service will eventually die or will we keep seeing more and more failures?",

        "text": "Ive thought a lot about this, but come to the conclusion that there probably is a lot of factors i dont know about.\n\nHeres my thinking:\n\nThis is primarily focused on 10-15ish hour singleplayer titles in terms of value for money, but nevertheless still applies to other games i think.\n\nA quick google search tells me an average budget of a blockbuster movie and triple A video game, respectively is between $50-100 million and $80 million. To give a bit of wiggle room, lets just say they are the same.\n\nFrom what i can gather a new bluray is $20, and just one or two years down the line that drops consideratly. Compare that to $60 dollar video game that often doesnt drop that much in price.\n\n**Obviously its not as simple as saying games are 3 times the price**. Theres a lot of factors, such as post launch updates and server maintenance costs (for multiplayer games). In many games, you could argue microtransactions takes care of that, but i don't know any numbers.\n\nAnother very important factor is the games and movies budget, and expected revenue. I don't have enough knowledge to say anything meaningful. Thats one of the reasons i'm asking here. All i'm gonna say is this: even though Dishonored 2 is an amazing title and one of my favorite games ever made, that game does not deserve the same price tag as Red Dead 2 - just to illustrate my point.\n\nI know there is a lot to take into consideration, and im really interested in learning about this.

I'd go so far as to say they make some of the best historical fiction out there, from Egypt to Rome to Constantinople the way they've portrayed these places and periods is awesome barring a few inaccuracies.\n\nI will say that the maps do get very bloated and that is a valid criticism, but playing through the trilogy I realised even for all its faults, the AC open world formula has been a huge influence for the last 15 or so years, from The Witcher 3 to RDR2 there's AC DNA in there.\n\nAll of this is to say that I think Ubisoft gets a bad rap when it comes to the quality of their games, they may be a shitty company but to say the games are soulless is a slap in the face to the actual development teams behind their games.\n\nThoughts?",

We are all human and we all like physically appealing things. We all like beautiful, attractive women and strong, badass men.\n\nThese aren't the only example of game developers purposefully going out of their way to allow female characters to be physically appealing.

You lost your skill? Nah, the game is rigged, and I don't talk about a specific game, but the way those games are built.\n\nThey fool you, every time, shift the difficulty, gives you strong items, then shitty items, then throw epic bosses at you, and so on.\n\nThen after 10 hours you already bought 25 permanent upgrades and had a lucky run regarding the items you found, and WALLA you beat the final boss.\n\nWhy did it take you 10 hours? If you reached the final boss so easily after 1 or 2 hours? \n\nYou didn't get much better at the game, maybe you learned how to dodge the enemy attacks better and got more clinical with your shooting, but the bottom line you are in the mercy of the game's algorithm, either you found good items or had easier enemies to deal with.\n\nYou bought so many permanent upgrades that made you so much stronger, you unlocked shortcuts, you found a way to cheese your way through some of the bosses.\n\nDid you get better? Did you \"learn\" the game? All a lie, an illusion.\n\nSo my point is, I don't understand the popularity this genre is having in recent years, I feel like gamers love this illusion of them being so good at video games (sure, if it's fun for them then by all means, this is what games are for), but do they really believe this? That they improved so much in that game? Or do they realize those games are rigged?",

        "text": "I think it's important to remember that roleplaying games originated in the table top space before video games had found their feet.  Because in board games you rarely play as something that could be called a character.  At most you could have an avatar or token to keep track of your position on the game board.  And in the war games that D&amp;D evolved out of, you're sort of just playing this abstract administrative entity.  People joke that the literal term \"role-playing game\" is misleading because after all you play the role of Master Chief in Halo, right?  But in board games that semantic distinction does make sense.\n\nHow RPG came to be used in video games seems to be some amalgamation of progression systems, dialogue options, branching storylines, and a fantastical setting.  I don't see that last criteria mentioned often but it's clearly an unspoken rule because seemingly every game with knights and swords enters the \"Is it an RPG?\" conversation whereas games with a contemporary setting like The Sims or FIFA Career Mode don't despite ticking an awful lot of boxes otherwise.  I guess you could say the one criteria they fail is the player journey is self-driven, there's no external call to... _adventure_, hmmmm.  But furthermore I'm not sure those other mechanics can be considered a clean genre break either.\n\nProgression systems are kind of in everything, and I'm not just talking about the recent deluge of skill trees and multiplayer rank-ups.  Items and upgrades have been a staple of video games since the beginning.  In fact one inspiration for this post was playing through a text-based RPG called Roadwarden and realizing its progression was very similar to Legend of Zelda.  Now you might say it's not the same (even though in that Roadwarden/LoZ comparison they pretty much are the same) because they're missing all those stats.  But that's more of a UX decision; the stats are indeed there, the game code requires them.  But for reasons that are often purely down to aesthetics, they're not represented as pages of numbers like a sports almanac.\n\nAnd as far as dialogue options and branching storylines?  The degree to which they're even incorporated into RPGs is subject to a huge amount of variance.  You have RPG directors like Josh Sawyer who openly admit the scope of real diverging stories is untenable and a generous amount of smoke and mirrors is required.  But furthermore adventure games borrow reactive storytelling elements all the time; seemingly every auteur from Ken Levine to David Cage experiments with weaving player agency into the narrative.  Is the difference between the two all that notable?  The problem of exponential growth as well as the desire for a cohesive narrative severely restricts how often games can offer genuinely story-impacting decisions.  It seems weird to define a genre by a mechanic that presents itself so rarely in gameplay.\n\nTo wrap back around to Halo.  Think about how you would translate it to a board game.  Not just the IP but a faithful adaptation of Combat Evolved that would be familiar to players of the original.  Of course none of the action would translate, you'd have to abstract that into some kind of grid system with various unit stats.  You couldn't import all the level environments either.  You could describe them, but you'd still lose out on that sense of agency imparted by spatial navigation.  To preserve the player's control of the adventure, you'd have to find other ways for them to make choices.  Perhaps they can pick their engagements, or decide what equipment they want to prepare for a fight, or how they want to interact with other characters.  And what do you know, this Halo board game is starting to look an awful lot like an RPG module.  I posit that the entire genre label is an artifact of the table top medium.\n\nIn video games the difference between roleplaying and adventure games is marginal and the genre segregation is less meaningful than the action verbs themselves, i.e. what does the player do in the game.  I suspect this is why there's so much contention over what an RPG is because players are looking for wildly different things.  Dark Souls and Stardew Valley are supposedly both RPGs, but do you think they share much player overlap at all?  Of course not.  One is about killing lovecraftian monsters in a gothic hellscape and the other is about farming and building relationship in a small town.  It's clear to anyone with eyeballs that you'd have far more luck pitching Devil May Cry to Souls players or Animal Crossing to Stardew players even though neither Devil May Cry nor Animal Crossing is traditionally considering an RPG.",

        "text": "I don't really know how to start this, so I'll just get straight to the point.\n\nA few years back I discovered Cheat Engine, which makes \"cheating\" on games quite easy if you know what to look for, months pass by and that craving for cheating which just makes the game so much easier go larger, I started cheating on every game I downloaded.  \nAnd a couple years later, here I am, doing the exact same thing, sometimes I get banned, perma banned or the game just feels boring. It's an urge I can't control because most of the times its so much easier finding out how to bypass the need to actually play the game normally rather than waste hundreds of hours to get the exact same thing. Also when I say cheating I'm not talking like giving myself items or stuff like that, I usually get an unfair advantage, find something that should work the way it should, like a dupe glitch, taking advantage of something not being clarified or blocked correctly.\n\nI'd really like to stop cheating in games because it just makes the gameplay spoiled, it ruins it. What is more, I sometimes don't cheat for a while (only for legendary titles like titanfall, crysis or the cod campaigns, etc.) But after the first playthrough I just decide to boot up a trainer and cheat my way through the game.\n\nI do understand it's all about using your brain to actually think and prevent yourself from cheating but I always fair, if there's a way to cheat, I will find it and use it. There's literally no game that fully prevents the player from cheating even if it's for a day, month or a year, there's always a way to get the upper hand in games using articles from the 2010's. Some games don't even treat the player fairly, putting him against a playing having 10x the player's playtime which usually means the new player doesn't know most of the quite secret game mechanics and advantages you can use, take for example call of duty: black ops 2, you can be level 10 and be matched up to a player level 60 or above, this does also happen in rocket league, valorant(rarely) and more.\n\nTo sum up, I basically just want to play the game normally but I've already experienced how much more fun and easy it is using cheats which means I can't contain myself from using them (some might call this an addiction, and yes it is).\n\n  \nThanks in advance I guess?

The genre has also evolved over time to incorporate new technologies and mechanics, ensuring that it remains relevant and interesting to players.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nWalking simulators, on the other hand, are a relatively new genre that have emerged in the past decade or so. While they have certainly gained a following and have been the subject of critical acclaim, they have not yet achieved the same level of mainstream popularity as point and click adventure games.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nThat being said, the gaming industry is always evolving and changing, and it's possible that the popularity of walking simulators could grow in the future, particularly as new and innovative titles continue to be released.",

But other people can get miffed they can't literally go anywhere. Sometimes as a joke, sometimes they're serious.\n\nYou can keep using your favorite weapon on every enemy, until you face one that's completely immune to it. Some players don't like that you can't hit everything with your favorite sword or gun. Even where there's a different tactic that will work effectively on them.\n\nYou can keep herbs to heal you when you're low on health in the resident evil mansion, But you can only carry one with you as you also need to manage your ammo and guns taking up space too. Limited inventory space is the part of the game design. You need to consider what you need and when to carry it. But some players would rather be able to have 99 items of every healing item so you don't have to fear death. In a game about horror. \n\nTetris is a classic game that gives you every Tetromino to drop on the field. It doesn't always give you the one you need. But it always tries to give you every shape for fairness. But a lot of people would just want the I block the entire game.\n\n Some games could hide their rules better and some games could make them more clear. I know darkest dungeon has a disclaimer that you will lose party members permanently. If you can't accept that, you should play something else. Should more games have the rules of the game in big text on what you can and can't do in them? Or should they let you do whatever you want and find out as you go? Sometimes though, Players will just not be aware of other cool stuff you can do. because you weren't told you could do that. or never tried to experiment with it on their own.",

I feel like i can really lean into the experience of role playing this character and I'm worrying about game objectives less than in other games because the immersion experience and game objectives are really well blended. \n\nFor example, the map for Horizon FW is massive. It was sure fun to explore but i always had this feeling like i wanted to explore every nook and cranny before moving because going back because i missed something is a pain. \n\nI don't have this feeling (as much) with HL because i feel like the opportunity for immersion and game objectives are nicely intertwined. I do meet game objectives by authentically exploring but it feels like exploring rather than just finding things on a map. \n\nI feel like the small map with packed locations that you visit over and over again takes the anxiety out of getting everything on the first stop. If i miss something, no big deal, I'll be back to discover it in a more authentic way later. \n\nIn horizon, when i get to a new place, i talk to every person, search every nook and cranny for items, get all the side quests because I'm trying to do things I'm the most efficient way possible. I sometimes can't stop myself from optimizing the fun out of the game. \n\nI'm experiencing this less with HG because the difference stages of the story take place in the same locations. I don't have to worry about exploring Hogwarts castle in the way i explored towns in Horizon. I'll get most everything just by experiencing the game in a more immersive way rather than playing it like a game where i need to check things off a list. \n\nOf course, there are many aspects of the game that still feel \"gamey\" but I've noticed in this game more than others, I'm less focused on those parts. And i think the small map and how integrated the quests and collectibles are into the core immersive experience to the reason why.",

You could hint storywise that your character never got as powerful as he did in the game, because you don't have to be that strong to beat the game.",

        "text": "Something interesting with Celeste is that every moving platform in the game is activated or controlled by the player. Blocks that move require you to dash into them or grab them before they start moving. \n\nThe lack of moving obstacles in general is shown through chapter 3, where the gimmick is moving hazards. Chapter 8 also has the gimmicks of moving hazards with the fire variant, but has probably what is the closest to moving platforms that are independent from the player with the ice variant. While the floating ice blocks you can bounce off move independently from interaction from the player, they don't have the collision of a normal block, instead acting like an enemy that you bounce off of.\n\nThe explanation that I think is the most likely for this is wanting to give the player control over the pace of the game and not needing to wait for cycles. Chapter 3 somewhat runs into this problem, but it's much easier to run to avoid a moving obstacle without waiting than to hit a moving platform without waiting because  the amount of paths to avoid something is much higher than to go towards something. Chapter 8 has almost exclusively circular and line patterns with the fire/ice balls, with each fire/ice ball being followed by another one shortly after. This means that even if you miss the cycle, another one will replace it shortly after.\n\nThere's a lot that could be explored with having simple moving or rotating platforms in Celeste. Celeste seems to want to only explore each mechanic in isolation rather than combining them. Even in chapter 7, the level that combines every level, the level gimmicks have separated segments. I think chapter 9 combines more mechanics than every other chapter, but it wishes to introduce new mechanics like the jellyfish and pufferfish instead of combining old ones. Celeste seems to be going for minimalism by exploring just the mechanics it has set up in a chapter and rarely introducing smaller ones to compliment them like moving platforms.\n\nAnother explanation for the lack of moving platforms is the way momentum works in Celeste. Jumping off of a moving platform send you flying at an unnaturally high speed. This doesn't mean moving platforms that are independent from the player are impossible, but maybe it feels wonky to have platforms that can send you flying with every potential jump off of them. \n\nThe mixtape platforms are an example of the environment moving independent from the player, but the platforms only pop in and out of existence rather than moving. This could be an explanation for either the design philosophy of minimalism or moving platforms feeling weird to navigate in Celeste. Celeste has the mechanic of disappearing platforms, but only decides to use them in a very specific context instead of mixing them with other obstacles for the most part, which could the explanation for minimalism. Maybe this example shows that Celeste is okay with using independent blocks from the player, but not moving ones because they feel awkward.\n\nI imagine having rotating platforms is outside the scope of the engine of Celeste. These would run into a similar issue where you would be launched in the direction the platform is rotating or moving. Another reason for not including them is because rotating platforms wouldn't work the best with the pixel grid of the game unless it had specific animations of it rotating, which could look choppy without enough frames.\n\nAnother example of either a engine limitation or a design choice is the option to have no unique types of surfaces. There's no ice that's slippery, not conveyor belts that move you when you touch them, and no bouncy or sticky floor. Some of these things were implemented in a slightly different way to having specific surfaces that change properties. A bouncy surface has the cloud that springs you up, and conveyor belts that launch you is somewhat fulfilled by the moving blocks. The tentacle walls in chapter 3 is an example of a unique surface, but you'll notice that the surface itself doesn't change, but a hazard appears in front of it. This shows that maybe there was a desire to have more surfaces like this, but it wasn't possible due to limitations.\n\nThese subtle things are what makes Celeste and other great games feel unique. It's clear that Celeste isn't trying to copy the feel and design of something like Mario or other games, otherwise it'd have these things that it lacks. Celeste isn't a copy of what came before, it carves out its own identity and feel. \n\nThe End is Nigh has a similar feel to Super Meat Boy and achieves many of the same things with the level design. It has its differences, but they both have a heavy emphasis on moving hazard and timing jumps through them. While it could be argued that The End is Nigh is a better game than Super Meat Boy, it didn't do as much to set itself apart from it that Super Meat Boy did with the games before it, which is why I think people forget about it.\n\nIt's interesting to look at the design trends of different games. Dustforce has a complete lack of moving platforms and hazards (aside from enemies). It also lacks any stage gimmicks and relies its base mechanics. N++ also largely lacks moving platforms, but has plenty of moving hazards and combines them in every way possible. Each one of these games carves out an identity in ways that are less apparent than the game's gimmick.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/118bjdw/reasons_to_not_buy_or_promote_atomic_heart/",
        "text": "I originally was going to title this topic something like \"Please do not buy...\" but then decided against it as those kinds of posts only start comment wars. So instead I just want to give you a set of facts and my own opinions for you to draw conclusions from.\n\n**Arguments against the developer**\n\nMundfish, the developer of Atomic Heart , is based in Cypress, most likely for tax reasons, but the main staff is clearly either Russian or has strong ties to Russia. Artem Galeev, the art director, is actually still working for CGCompany, one of the largest Russian CG devs and another Russian company, according to his LinkedIn. You can find similar ties with other heads: Evgenia Sedova, Oleg Gorodyshenin etc.\n\nYou could say we shouldn't blame all Russians for the invasion. But these developers allegedly live of Russia and don't have to worry about getting jail time for condemning the war, yet they have never done so.  This to me is a huge red flag, if you are making a Soviet game during the time of Russian invasion and have nothing to fear from speaking out and you don't then clearly you have strong voluntary government ties or you actually support the war. In fact condemning the war would likely boost the sales of their game but they still choose to not do it.\n\nOne of the reasons for this is because Russian Gazprom is a large investor into making the game, the same Gazprom has recently announced creating a private military group. So any investment returns from the game would be funding a new military group invading Ukraine.\n\nThe developers say they are outside politics, however they clearly use real political content in their games. E.g. the iconic crescent moon hairstyle on the cover robot is actually the hairstyle of Ukrainian PM Yuliya Tymoshenko from 2010s. They could have picked literally anything from actual Soviet times but did not.\n\nI can link a more in-depth dive into these ties int he comment but overall the main gist is that the developers could have easily made a statement condemning the invasion which would likely end the calls for boycott, but they decided not to. My personal opinion is this is because of their investors and because they target Russians (who they know have a large amount of invasion supporters) as their demographic.\n\n**Arguments against promoting the game itself**\n\nThese are a bit less concrete, but even if the game happened to materialize on its own some arguments could be made against promoting it based on the game itself. Note that I haven't actually played the game so this is from me looking at gameplays etc.\n\nThe game is clearly glorifying the Soviet life and regurgitating the Soviet ideals of expanding their way of life to other nations. It is also filled with Soviet trope characters like Baba Zina etc. which I guess is kind of the point of the game. Soviet idealization has been Putins tool for 20 years to build hostile outlook of Russians at western countries. Where Bioshock 3 (which seems like a good comparison to make) was actually deconstructing a lot of americana tropes Atomic Heart actually embraces them. \n\nI am sure this game will be heavily popularized in Russia, I have already seen it in pretty much all mainstream Russian media, unlike any other game before it. This itself is also weird if you consider the developers claim that they are not a Russian studio. The timing of the game of just before the next announced mobilization wave couldn't have been better for the Russian government. the government is likely oping to use it to boost morale of the newly mobilized as they are giving them the same pro-Soviet bs when they convince them to join the war.\n\nThe idea of Bioshock but Soviet sounds interesting on paper but by trying to idealize it the developers missed the huge part of suffering that the Soviet rule has brought upon the population. It is as if you were playing an idealized Nazi Germany without any mention of the crimes committed during the period. Imagine you are playing Wolfenstein but you're an actual Nazi fighting some robots. Just to recap on the crimes of the Soviet era:  \n\n\n* Stalins regime alone executed over a million people total. Stalin is responsible for about at least 20 million deaths (some numbers go up to 60 million).\n* 7 million people died in the Soviet famine, and the worst areas had the famine artificially concentrated, so 3.5-5 million of those dead were in Ukraine that actually had crops. Crops have been forcibly relocated from Ukraine to other areas to reduce the more pro-independence population.\n* Deportation of Chechens and Ingush - In 1943 and 1944, the Soviet government accused several entire ethnic groups of Axis collaboration. As a punishment, several entire ethnic groups were deported, mostly to Central Asia and Siberia into labor camps. \n* Black January - a violent crackdown in Baku in 1990\n* Soviet–Afghan War\n* Hungarian Revolution (1956) - According to the United Nations Report of the Special Committee on the problem of Hungary (1957): \"Soviet tanks fired indiscriminately at every building from which they believed themselves to be under fire.\"\n* Throughout the history of USSR the continued repressions and deportations of those opposing the current regime. Prisons and labor camps filled with deportees forced to worked until their death in horrible conditions with no way of returning home.\n\nThere is overall lots of content that could be made in the Soviet setting, but it would have to take some kind of Wolfenstein-like approach and actually depict those lives better instead of being a propaganda piece, but I gues Gazprom wouldn't invest in that.",

        "text": "Every other open world FPS I've played is better than Halo Infinite. That might sound harsh and it is. I've never played an open world FPS that completely and utterly fails to justify being Open World or Semi Open world other than Halo Infinite. \n\nI hated Halo Infinite's campaign. It did nothing the old games didn't do, and didn't do anything new other than add a grappling hook that invalidates the sandbox and limitations of mjolnir and breaks the game. \n\nOf every Open World /Semi Open-World FPS I've played:\n\n* Metro Exodus\n* Stalker SoC, CoP, (even Clear Sky)\n* Every single Far Cry (Seriously, even New Dawn did more with its Open World. I've played them all, they all utilize open world better than Halo Infinite. Even Far Cry Instincts is better because at least its short and focused)\n* Every Borderlands (even Borderlands 3 and The Pre Sequel)\n* Rage, Rage 2 (Rage is the closest it gets to worse)\n* Crysis\n* Deus Ex HR, Mankind Divided, Fallout 3, NV, and 4 (kind of FPS games)\n* Cyberpunk 2077\n* Arma / Operation Flashpoint \n\n**Halo Infinite's Campaign is without a doubt worse than all of those games**. It takes nothing that makes open world games good, and everything that makes them bad. It was a bland, annoying, vapid experience with gameplay that would be good, except the grappling hook again, invalidates the entire sandbox / gameplay loop. **The AI doesn't know what the hell to do against it**.\n\nOne of the biggest problems with open world is players cheesing the game. In Halo CE, 21 years ago on the level \"Halo\", if you climb on top of the canyon and snipe all the covenant in the last area, the marines will shoot their own way out of the forerunner structure when the covenant run out to reinforce them. They won't do this in any other situation. Not even if you kill all of the covenant on the surface up close, ONLY if you cheese it and take a warthog up to the canyon top and snipe them all. The developers clearly thought about players breaking the game in creative ways on the more open maps, despite there only being 4 open maps. When developers can design a game with cheesing in mind, cheesing doesnt break the game.\n\nIn Halo Infinite, it does. If you sit outside of range and snipe the covenant, either nothing happens, or they instantly see you and know where you are no matter how far away you are.\n\nMarines can't drive, have nothing interesting to say, and barely seem aware of the situation they're in. All they do is spout off dumb quips like brainless MCU automatons. They appear when they're needed, they disappear when they aren't.\n\nNo longer do you have to adapt to the weaknesses and strengths of Mjolnir, you can just get shield upgrades, health upgrades, capacity upgrades, grappling hook upgrades etc. The entire reason halo's combat was so satisfying was mastering Mjolnirs weaknesses and not just its strengths. Learning how much damage you could take before you'd need to take cover, exactly how long it took for a recharge etc. Instead, with Halo Infinite we have a game that's not balanced for anything other than assuming you have fully upgraded Mjolnir. Who thought that was a good idea?\n\nHalos weapon sandbox was always at its weakest at long range, as it devolves in to just a few weapons being useful. The DMR/BR and Sniper Rifles, and a Rocket launcher. This is totally fine in the level based halos, as its cool to have the \"Sniper level\", and the \"vehicle levels\". They offer variety and a change of pace. Instead, in Halo Infinite we have an entire game like that. You see every weapon in the game in the first hour. Why is anything other than the BR, Sniper and Rocket launcher even in this game? They're totally pointless. You don't need anything else and all of the other weapons exist only so you don't always have ammo for the 3 weapons that are actually useful. And they have effectively infinite ammo anyway, because you can just go back to base for a refill. Over and over again. Then run back and kill more enemies until they're all dead.\n\nThe grappling hook singlehandedly killed any joy of speedrunning the game too. No one bothers. It's boring to do and boring to watch.\n\n**The writing is a complete nightmare.**\n\nThe Weapon. I couldn't stand The Weapon. I've never seen more of a lack of imagination. **The weapon could have been literally anything.** She could have had any characterization, looked like anything, acted like anything, had any personality. But did 343 do anything interesting with her? No, they made her a literal exact copy of Cortana. They could have done anything. After 20 years of Cortana we finally could have a new AI partner. Instead we got a Cortana programmed to be less useful. Genius.\n\n**The Endless are somehow worse than the flood because......they just are okay!** (How does being invulnerable to Halo's make them evil? **Well....They just are! Okay!** Halo is rated T for Teen now and we need a new villain because we can't bring back the M Rated Flood!)\n\nThe villains are a joke. The elites and brutes characterization is so dumb you wonder how the fuck they were ever a threat or got anything done. **The Banished are supposed to be this terrifying, hyper competent fork of the covenant that couldn't be brought in line. Yet they spend the entire game popping up in holograms, ranting like Saturday morning cartoon villains about how weak you are and how strong they are, before dying uselessly.**\n\nNot understanding you have to outsmart a strong opponent, instead of out fighting them. They die over and over while cackling like lunatics about how \"You won't get away with it this time!!\" **Imagine talking shit to Buster Douglas after he knocked out Mike Tyson. Decimus is** ***that*** **stupid.** You never see them actually planning, conniving or doing anything even remotely clever like in Halo 2. At no point did I feel like the villains of Halo Infinite justified how much of a threat the game wanted me to think they were they were with their actions. It was the opposite. Schoolchildren would be able to outsmart The Banished. You see no intrigue, no cunning, no guile. From start to finish the banished are bumbling, self sabotaging idiots with zero charisma and intelligence.\n\nThey're so stupid they don't even seem like aliens anymore. Intelligent life in halo no longer acts like intelligent life.\n\n**I hated this game**. Ive played Halo since 2001 with CE. I didn't like 4 or 5 **at all**, but I can at least remember genuine moments in those games, and there's a lot to say about them.\n\nI can't remember much of anything about Halo Infinite aside from the beginning, the pilot getting kidnapped, and the end. No cool dialogue lines, no cool cutscenes, no cool levels. I can't even replay any missions. I only noticed the music when it was distracting\n\nOh yeah, and the entire game looks the same. There's more variety in the first 4 hours of Halo CE than in the entirety of Halo Infinite. \n\n**What about the multiplayer?**\n\n[There's ten other better shooters that came out last year and this year that don't charge me 10 dollars for the color blue. I play those instead.](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/BtuXEqYYdHs)",

        "text": "Revita is an action Roguelite with gorgeous pixel art and wonderful gameplay. I’m genuinely shocked it’s not more well known, it’s up there with Crosscode for amazing underrated indie games.\n\nWhat’s the gist of it? You climb a tower, room by room, and go through 2d platforming procedurely generated levels to get to the top of the tower. Of course, there’s more too it than that, but this is just an overview.\n\nThe game features very combat, with multiple starting weapons and a lot of items. The best comparison I can make with the combat is Isaac+Gungeon. Gungeon in the way you have to skillfully dodge attacks with a dash, and Isaac with the way items work.\n\nSpeaking of items, there’s a lot. It has more than half of Isaacs items (which is a lot for a game so young), but I feel like there’s also a lot less item bloat, and a lot of them serve a purpose. Every time I play this game I end up with a totally different build, which makes the game really addictive.\n\nOne of the main gimmicks to the game is that health is a resource. You get most items by sacrificing health to statues and chests, and you upgrade items by spending max HP. To balance this, it’s very easy to get hp because it has a soul bar similar to Hollow Knight, and you gain souls by killing enemies. You can also heal past max HP and expand it, so your health will be very volatile the entire game. Initially, I didn’t like this mechanic, but it really grew on me and now I ablsolutely love it.\n\nThe enemy variety is very good, and the post game rivals isaacs. The one thing that is a bit lacking, is the fact that there are only 10 bosses, and half of them are reskins, but the bosses are very well made, balanced, and fair and fun to fight. Plus, there’s a reason why there are mainly 5 unique bosses, which I will not spoil.\n\nAnd finically, the art, music, and lore is stellar, and suprised me with and atmosphere similar to Hollow Knight.\n\nWhy didn’t it get popular? I don’t really know, but I have some guesses. It could be due to an oversatiated market for indie roguelikes, the health mechanics may scare some people off, there wasn’t much marketing, and the game had a very slow start, so some people may have dropped it. This really is a shame, because I consider this one of the best roguelikes since Dead Cells.\n\nWhat were your thoughts on the game?",

        "text": "Hey guys - so I have been on Reddit for quite a bit, especially to follow gaming and keep up with new games etc.  \n  \nBy now though, it became evident to me, that for every noteworthy post, I scroll through about 10 hours of completely unnecessary posts in order to get to the content I want.  \n  \nThe reality is, there isn't that much to go through and most posts concern industry internal news or the latest shitstorm topic which I couldn't care less about.  \n  \nI already try to focus what I follow and reduced it to (what I think) are the best subs in their \"genre\".  \n  \ngames for general news  \nvrgaming for VR related stuff  \ntruegaming &amp; patientgamers for discussion-centric posts.  \n  \nI got rid of subs like gaming &amp; nintendoswitch ages ago, because they just employ a horrendous ratio of crap vs news.  \n  \nSo - to tackle this issue I thought about only looking into these subs once a week, filter by top/week and then I'm good, right?  \n  \nExtremely wrong - because what gets upvoted and what's actually interesting (or even factual) are two extremely different things.  \n\nIn general, the dumbest memes and latest arts and crafts projects (looking at you nintendoswitch) are apparently much more interesting than the actual games.    \n  \nSo now, I'm in the process of switching to Inoreader, which is basically an old school RSS client on steroids.  \nIt (hopefully) allows me to curate my own stream of information without all the noise (still testing, though).  \nApart from that I use an app to track my games wishlist and movies / shows I want to see.\n\nPersonally my goals are:  \n* Find out about all the upcoming games that might be interesting to me (while filtering out asset flips and junk games)   \n* Stay on top of new hardware developments (PC/Consoles)\n* Read interesting, long articles on gaming-related topics  \n* Avoid click-baity low effort content     \n  \nWhich to me begs the question - have you been in the same situation and how do you organize your streams of gaming related information?",

It was honestly the best game so far for this specific purpose, mission based and straightforward so it suited me well even on higher difficulties. I would only pause audiobook when leveling and customizing abilities, weapons etc.\n\nHowever now I'm struggling to find a good game that can be fun and doesn't block my comprehension when listening to an audiobook.\n\nSomething similar to Nioh with skippable or not too much story is preferable (I already played enough Souls games to last me 10 lifetimes, check name lol, also played Nioh 1 a few years ago.) But I'm also open to any other kind of game, even online ones as long as its not comb shooter since I just end up playing the game and turning off the audiobook.",

There were very few non-combatants and he was protecting pretty much an amalgam of his daughter who he failed to save before. Marlene was a zealot at that point. That one guard from part 1 was a dick. The other guy was holding a knife and everyone else were trying to kill him and Ellie for the entire trip. I don’t feel as if he has anything to answer for considering these factors. If it were a one on one situation such as winner takes all for revenge for that situation, sure. May the best person win. But anything else as regards to punishment for Joel is screwed up. If it were me I’d have killed all of them so there’d be no one to come back for revenge and destroyed the building. Sorry for any spoilers on the last post. It’s down.",
