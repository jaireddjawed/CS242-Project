Not to mention how many movies The Driver influenced itself, obviously Drive being one of them.  \n  \nAs far as \"They Drive by Night\" I was expecting it to be amazing seeing Bogey and George Raft in it together. It's a shame they didn't get along (going by rumours) because they could have been in much better movies together given how strong Bogey's schedule was.  \n  \nAfter watching The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent a couple of days ago I figured I'd watch another Nicholas Cage movie and settled on Red Rock West which I loved. Dennis Hopper playing a psychopath never gets old and while Nicholas Cage gets ridiculed for taking a lot of bad roles, this is one of his best personally.  \n  \nFeel free to comment your thoughts on any of these movies or any noir movies you've watched recently. I appreciate your thoughts.",

        "text": " \n\nIn an alternate universe, DC played the cinematic universe card before Marvel and coincidentally ordered their movies in the exact same way. Please know that I'm not saying that DC would have been better off going this route. I just want to look at what it would have looked like had DC used the MCU Method.\n\nI'm just gonna do the first saga (first 3 phases) to save myself a headache. I'm also just gonna name the movies that I think would have been made and a few of the side projects that may or may not be canon.\n\nIf anybody wants it, I might elaborate on the plots and stuff of the movies. And I may do the next saga after Marvel's Multiverse Saga is complete.\n\nI will confess that quite a few of these suggested movies aren't mine. I credit the Youtuber, *The Black Lion.* Link: [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itrbckG2Ebk&amp;t=4s*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itrbckG2Ebk&amp;t=4s) and also [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfS8lcQ7DCU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfS8lcQ7DCU) for the side projects.\n\nI want you to note that I'm not a hardcore DC fan so if you have any input please comment about it.\n\nGeez. I talk a lot. Anyway, without further ado...\n\n**DC CINEMATIC UNIVERSE**\n\n**PART 1: APOKOLIPS SAGA**\n\n**PHASE 1**\n\n* Superman: Man of Steel (2008) - *Iron-Man*\n* The Martian Manhunter (2008) - *The Incredible Hulk*\n* Superman: Dawn of Justice (2010) - *Iron-Man 2*\n* Wonder Woman (2011) - *Thor*\n* The Batman (2011) - *Captain America: The First Avenger*\n* Justice League (2012) - *The Avengers*\n\n**PHASE 2**\n\n* Superman: Last Son of Krypton (2013) - *Iron-Man 3*\n* Wonder Woman 1984 (2013) - *Thor: The Dark World*\n* Batman: The Red Hood (2014) - *Captain America: The Winter Soldier*\n* Suicide Squad (2014) - *Guardians of the Galaxy*\n* Justice League: The Tower of Babel (2015) - *Avengers: Age of Ultron*\n* The Atom (2015) - *Ant-Man*\n\n**PHASE 3**\n\n* Batman: The Darkest Knight (2016) - *Captain America: Civil War*\n* SHAZAM!

I don't know. Would they be as popular? I think that they would be more popular than they are right now.

        "text": " It’s almost time for the Oscars, and that means it’s almost time for another round of the hopeless endeavor of trying to objectively rank art. To get in the spirit, I thought I would try to determine what really are the “Greatest Movies of All Time.” To do this I decided to turn to the internet, where all the correct opinions about movies are held. I went through four of the major movie ranking lists on the internet, representing different levels of film enthusiasm and knowledge, and found all the movies they had in common to make a list of the “Greatest Movies of All Time.”\n\n**If you just want to jump right in, there is a TL;DR half-way down with a link to the document.** \n\nBut if you would like a bit more detail, let me introduce the Source Lists.\n\n**The Source Lists:**\n\n\\- The IMDB Top 250: The most well-known movie ranking list with the most engagement from the general public due to the ubiquity of IMDB. Free to use and anyone’s review can influence a film’s ranking on this list. It is generally seen as very populist.\n\n\\- The Letterboxd Top 250: More niche than IMDB and normally used by people who are already in online film discussion circles rather than the general public. However, still free to use and anyone’s review can impact a film’s ranking on the list. It can be seen as an enthusiast list.\n\n\\- The Sight &amp; Sound Critic’s Top 250 (2022 Edition): Published by the British Film Institute once every decade, this list is formed by the aggregated selections of 1,639 polled film critics and scholars. Only the critics polled can affect a films placement on the list. It can be seen as a “professional” list.\n\n\\- The Sight &amp; Sound Director’s Top 100 (2022 Edition): Similar to the Critic’s Top 250, the British Film Institute polled 480 directors and formed a separate aggregated list. Like the critic’s version, only the directors polled can affect a film’s placement on the list. This can also be seen as a “professional” list.\n\nNow that you’ve been introduced to the lists that I am now all too familiar with, let me give you a brief breakdown of the document I made to show the data I collected.\n\n**The Document:** There are five(5) sheets in the document. Here is a quick summary of what is on each sheet.\n\n\\- Sheet 1: Movies on this sheet appear on all four of the lists. These are the titular “Greatest Movies of All Time.” Each movie’s title, director, and year of release is listed. Also listed are the movies’ specific placements on each list, an average placement, the best placement a movie achieves on any one list, the worst placement a movie achieves on any one list, and the difference between those two placements (∆). By default, the movies are ordered by their average rating.\n\n\\- Sheet 2: Due to the Sight &amp; Sound Director’s List being only a Top 100 instead of a Top 250 like the other three lists, this sheet shows the movies that appear on all four lists if every list were limited to a Top 100 like the Director’s List. All data given and formatting is the same as on Sheet 1.\n\n\\- Sheet 3: Movies on this sheet appear on three of the four lists. The movies are sorted into groups with each group having a heading that says which of the three lists they were on. Within the groups, the films are sorted alphabetically (NOT BY PLACEMENT).\n\n\\- Sheet 4: Movies on this sheet appear on two of the four lists. The formatting is the same as Sheet 3.\n\n\\- Sheet 5: Movies on this sheet appear on only one list. The formatting is the same as Sheets 3 and 4.\n\n**TL;DR: I looked at the IMDB Top 250, the Letterboxd Top 250, The Sight and Sound Critic’s Top 250, and the Sight and Sound Director’s Top 100 and found every movie that was on all four lists.**\n\nNow with introductions out of the way, we can finally get to “The Great Movies of All Time.” Here is the document: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/159DIgPbZCuNzbBl6EQT7ox2rD-aXf6GQpcZrEt7F5qY/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/159DIgPbZCuNzbBl6EQT7ox2rD-aXf6GQpcZrEt7F5qY/edit#gid=0)\n\n**\\*DISCLAIMER: IMDB and Letterboxd list positions are constantly updated. Certain movies might have shifted slightly from when I made this list\\***\n\n**My Observations:**\n\nThe immediate standout from looking at the “Greatest Movies” is that *Citizen Kane* is nowhere to be found. That is because it is not present on Letterboxd’s current Top 250 at all. For fun, I calculated the average ranking of *Citizen Kane* if it was #250 on Letterboxd’s list. It would have an average rating of 87.5, putting it between *Barry Lyndon* and *Ikiru*.\n\nAnother absence is any form of animation. The Director’s List serves as a roadblock for three animated movies making the “Greatest Movies” list. *Spirited Away*, *My Neighbor Totoro*, and *Grave of the Fireflies*. If the Director’s List was expanded to a Top 250, maybe all three would be on it. Or maybe most directors just aren’t big fans of animation and would still leave them off. Who knows. For fun, I calculated the best possible average for *Spirited Away* (it being #101 on the theoretical expanded Director’s List). It would have an average rating of 54.5, putting it between *Psycho* and *Parasite*. \n\nIn terms of diversity of films represented, I think the list is decent. Geographically speaking, many world regions are represented. But many major areas such as any sort of Chinese language film (whether it be from mainland China, Hong Kong, or Taiwan), the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa all did not make the cut. There are also no films directed by a woman or black person. (Blame IMDB for this. Unless your name is Nadine Labaki/The Wachowski Sisters or Steve McQueen respectively, you never had a chance) \n\nAs for the movies on the list, I think it’s a pretty good collection. Almost all of the films are seminal movies that have more than stood the test of time. The one outlier here is *Parasite* not only making it on all four lists, but firmly cementing itself into a very high ranking spearheaded by being the #2 ranked movie on Letterboxd. *Parasite* also survives when each list is culled to only a Top 100. Only time will tell if this movie really is an instant classic or will fall off as recency bias fades. For reference, the second newest movie after *Parasite* is *Goodfellas*, released in 1990.\n\nThe Top 2 films are head and shoulders above the other movies. *The Godfather* unsurprisingly comes in at #1 with an Average Ranking of 5.5, which is solidly in its own tier. The #2 film, *Seven Samurai*, comes in with an average ranking of 15.75. While not as high as *The Godfather*, it still is significantly higher than every other movie below it.\n\nThe most “divisive” movie on the list is *Persona*. It has the largest difference between its highest placement (#9 on the Sight and Sound Director’s List) and its lowest placement (#243 on the IMDB Top 250). Most “divisive” movies (any movie with a ∆ over 200) come from having a high rating from one of the Sight and Sound polls and a low rating on IMDB. However two movies, *Vertigo* and *Some Like It Hot*, have a high difference due to their low Letterboxd ranking instead. \n\nWhat do you think of the ”Greatest Movies of All Time”? What shocking omissions are there? What unjust additions? I hope people find all of this at least somewhat as interesting as I did, and I hope it spurs someone to check out a movie they might have never considered before!",

Mr. Deeds, King Ralph, Brewster's Millions, My Fair Lady etc. all borrow different elements of an upjumped commoner being a fish out out water due to their newfound status. It's a great vehicle for comedy. I'd like to see what examples people can think of to make sure there aren't any I'm overlooking.\n\nHowever, I am hoping to find it used in a very specific way. I'd like to see example where the lucky commoner does *not* have a heart of gold. Rather than teaching the spoiled rich people a lesson in humanity, I'd like a version of this story where the subject is cranky, miserly or disinterested. Maybe someone who has a bone to pick with the world and intends to misuse his new power. Or someone like Zack Braff's character in *Garden State* who doesn't think the world has much to offer him. \n\nMuch the same way that *187* flipped the script from *To Sir, With Love* (and had the teacher corrupted by the students) I'd like to see a movie that flips the *King Ralph* script.

        "text": "Alright everyone, Oscar Sunday is quickly approaching and with it the growing anticipation to simultaneously be enthralled and disappointed by the glamour and politics of Hollywood. Well, to make it all a little more interesting we are doing Oscar Bingo again this year. A week ago we [asked you guys to come up with things that might happen at the Oscars](https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieMods/comments/11cto9g/official_oscar_bingo_submission_thread_2023/) and vote for your favorites. We then collected the top 65 plausible and non redundant submissions and our friends over at www.print-bingo.com made us a Bingo game card generator that has a ton of game cards for you fine folks to download.\n\n- Feel free to get however many you want for your needs but please don't waste them! \n\n- [Here is the gamecard generator.](https://print-bingo.com/reddit/oscars2023.php) Just do the captcha and your card will be generated via **link to a pdf.** You will have to click the link for the card, don't do the captcha a bunch of times because it's not automatically downloading. That wastes cards and each one could be a winner!\n\n- Check out [last year's game thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/tpwcq7/oscar_bingo_game_thread_2022/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=MovieMods&amp;utm_content=t3_11cto9g) for reference.\n\nEveryone is welcome to participate. On Oscar Sunday we will make an official game thread for everyone to discuss their cards and the game. The game thread will also serve as a referee zone for me and participating users to make judgement calls on the more ambiguous answers. Here are some things to know about the \"competition\" side of this little shindig:\n\n- You can win.  To win, you ***MUST*** do three things.\n\n1. Take a photo or a screenshot of the winning card with the correct squares marked.\n\n2. E-mail it to an e-mail account that will be posted in the game thread.\n\n3. Make sure the **serial number** on the card is either visible or included in the e-mail along with your reddit username. This will help us verify that there's no funny business, hoopla, or any befuddling of any sort.\n\nThis is the cleanest way to do it, first three valid e-mails that meets all of that criteria win. Once the winners are validated we will update OP in the game thread.\n\n- This thread will be stickied until Oscar night when we make the game thread. There will also be an official Oscar discussion thread separate from the Bingo game thread.\n\n\nFinally, none of this ridiculousness could have been possible for such a large-scale website without print-bingo.com, and they have a message for us!\n\n*\"Print-Bingo.com is used by hundreds of teachers, event hosts, party organizers, and ex-pats in all corners of the globe to make both traditional and custom bingo cards through a web browser. We are happy to help Reddit with this fun, specialized, use of our website.\"*\n\nSo hey! Pick up a gamecard. Pick up 5. Play with your friends. Play alone with your cat. And let this be a reminder to all of us not to take the Oscars too seriously.",

When June logs into Kevin's Gmail, wouldn't he have gotten an email saying there has been a login from a different device? Would he have nipped the whole investigation in the bud then by deleting incriminating emails about previous cases, etc.?\n2. Once Kevin/James realize that June was texting Heather from Kevin's secret text account, why did they continue using it later to talk about the cameras? We know kevin/James realized it was being used by June, because they ended up killing Heather immediately. So I am unsure why they wouldn't just switch accounts when talking about the cameras later? It's possible I misunderstood this bit. \n\nWould love to hear what you all think.",

        "text": "Of the movies that I’ve seen that had to recast characters, I’d say Matrix handled it the best - though that may be cheating.\n\nIt may be cheating because The Oracle’s appearance changing really isn’t all that difficult to explain within the lore of the Matrix. It had the easiest time of the films I’ve seen, and handled it the best.\n\nThe other films I’ve seen which had to recast (or deal with the death of a principle character) would include Harry Potter, Fantastic Beasts, Star Wars, and Hunger Games. \n\nHunger Games ranks 2nd. I haven’t read the books, but I thought the films handled the death of Philip Seymour Hoffman’s character quite well. \n\nHarry Potter would rank 3rd. Richard Harris felt like the perfect Dumbledore, but Michael Gambon did a fine enough job, and the thing fans dislike him for the most was certainly a result of the directors and not him. Gambon portrayed a fairly aggressive Dumbledore in Goblet of Fire, but it was up to the director to reign this in (assuming he didn’t direct Gambon to act that way in the first place). Gambon was far more faithful to Dumbledore in Half Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows, meaning a great Dumbledore performance was entirely possible in the other films.\n\nLeia was not recast in The Rise of Skywalker, but the story was rewritten after her death and archival footage utilized to maintain some semblance of continuity. JJ was felt a shit hand with Carrie’s death, and I have no doubt Rise would’ve been better if she was still around. But I don’t think the problems with Rise can be entirely blamed on Carrie’s death, so at the end of the day it still would’ve been a bad film - just not as bad if Carrie was still around. \n\nI rank Fantastic Beasts last because this recasting was entirely self-inflicted. Johnny Depp did not die between Crimes of Grindelwald and Secrets of Dumbledore. Warner made the decision to axe him from the franchise due to outside controversy. I never truly got over the recasting, even as I recognized that Mads Mikkelson was probably the better choice for Grindelwald from the outset. It does not alleviate Secret of Dumbledore from the conundrum of recasting a major character despite the original actor not dying.",

Instead, Daley and Goldstein have crafted a movie driven by character and wit, a fantasy adventure unashamed to be about how we define love and family.\n\n- [Jacob Hall - Slashfilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1224736/dungeons-dragons-honor-among-thieves-review-sxsw/)\n\n&gt; “Honor Among Thieves” is built on the edifice of D&amp;D lore, packed with totems and characters and Easter eggs that fans of the legendary role-playing game will drink in with a connoisseur’s delight. But for those, like me, who have spent their lives avoiding anything to do with Dungeons &amp; Dragons, the film is eminently comprehensible and, in its you’ve-seen-it-before-but-not-quite-this-way fashion, a lot of fun. \n\n- [Owen Gleiberman - Variety](https://variety.com/2023/film/reviews/dungeons-and-dragons-honor-among-thieves-review-chris-pine-michelle-rodriguez-rege-jean-page-1235549630/)\n\n&gt; At the heart of both movie and boardgame is that deep sense of community and camaraderie, which bonds the quartet of misfits nicely. \n\n- [Kate Stables - Total Film](https://www.gamesradar.com/DandD-honour-among-thieves-review/)\n\n&gt;In the spirit of the game, Goldstein and Daley revel in the specificities of their world. They round out the personalities of their characters, pack their screenplay (written with Michael Gilio) with zingy one-liners and cleverly timed asides, and calibrate the action sequences so they rarely feel auxiliary to the narrative. A sense of play pulses through the film, which, with its bracing special effects, detailed production design and propulsive music, seems determined to activate viewer imaginations.  \n\n - [Lovia Gakye - The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/dungeons-dragons-honor-among-thieves-review-chris-pine-1235348051/)\n\n&gt; Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is a good heist film. A good fantasy film. A good adventure. And above all else, a good D&amp;D film. Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is a phenomenal adaptation of fantasy while never prioritizing one audience (those who are TTRPG players and the ones who aren’t) over the other. Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves makes my nerdy heart full.\n\n- [Kate Sanchez - But Why Tho?

I didn't like the last one much at all, as soon as the killers were revealed literally the only thought in my head was \"Is that it?\" Easily the most boring, forgettable, and definitely the most predictable killers in the franchise.\n\nAnd then this one rolls around. Set in Manhattan, which means suspension of disbelief is going to be working overtime, and the killer can dodge shotgun blasts at point blank range and move throughout the city undetected and has a secret layer with the outfit in a glass case. GHOSTFACE ISN'T FUCKING BATMAN YOU IDIOTS!!!!! Ghostface isn't supposed to be an unstoppable commando, it's supposed to be a psychotic kid/serial killer enthusiast. He's supposed to loose his cool when you taunt him on the phone, he's supposed to stumble a bit mid chase, and he's supposed to accidentally drop items related to the crime right in front of you while trying to blend in. That's the point it's supposed to be kids trying to act out a Hollywood production as a fantasy but failing a little here and there, not an actual unrealistic unstoppable movie killer, that's what makes it meta. I'll never forget how the fact that Ghostface tripped mid-chase actually made me MORE afraid because it makes it feel so much more real.\n\nTbh they shouldn't have kept going with these movies. It's a similar situation to the Terminator and Alien franchises where those two both should've ended after their second films, and Scream should've been done after the original trilogy. I did enjoy the spinoff series though, and Scream 4 was at least passable.",

But now that I have a new daughter, we have been enjoying animated films on weekends. I may be enjoying them more than she is at this point but I’d like to know who makes your favorite animated films? Is it Disney, Pixar, DreamWorks, something else? List your favorites and I will explore them together with my family. 🤘🏾",
