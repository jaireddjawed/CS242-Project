Just use [income-driven repayment](https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/plans/income-driven) (IDR). If you do research or something that is unpaid (or almost unpaid), your monthly payment will be tiny. The best news is that IDR will probably be your best option even after you match next year. \n\nI have seen folks who hit rock bottom because they think they will be on the hook to pay back their loans immediately after graduation in May. That's bullshit. DM me if you have other questions. Also, cash in on the pizza and beer from another post on here. That's a sweet deal.",

I can only imagine it getting worse once I have full reaponsibility fir patients, which will only increase, escalating to being the main responsible person for so many patients as a consultant/attending. That is a scary notion and I dont think I can ever do that.\n\nSo I want to go for other options, where I am not reaponsible for patients in any way. I have always liked basic science research esp neuroscience and pharmaceuticals, but I have a very naive fascination with it in that I expect it to be like stumbling about major discoveries and I know that is not how it will be ultimately.\n\nAcademia (the teaching part) is an option although it worries me if I could ever explain things well enough for all students to understand.\n\nIdk what other options exist.
