The bar would be surrounded with a ring of lasers which would be stopped by the cap. I figure that if it was made of the right material and the lasers were powerful enough then you could make a functioning sword which could cut through most material, but not other swords made the same way. The swords would clash due to the bars rather than the lasers, but it seems like it would work to me.\n\nI have absolutely no idea if this would actually work and am far from an expert on these things. I'm sure there's something I haven't considered that would cause it not to work. Thoughts?\n\nEdit: All right.

Hence my post, hopefully for some personal  clarification.\n\nTEDxBoulder - Thad Roberts - Visualizing Eleven Dimensions\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSz5BjExs9o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSz5BjExs9o)  \n\n\nEdit: Another video of Thad explaining the constants of nature  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc97QffsmxQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc97QffsmxQ) \n\nFirst  off, i'm not a scientist. But do love watching various interesting  subjects and stuff. I assume you've heard about Super String Theory. I  as well loved it, the first time i've heard about it. It did seem very  elegant. But lately i start to \"not have faith\" in the string theory  anymore, i feel that all those smart people are wasting their time on  this very interesting concept. Now, the TedX talk with Thad Roberts is  also in the same position as string theory (i think..) both unproven  ideas of what our reality might be on the smallest and biggest of  scales. This is why i find it strange not hearing more about this  concept of quantification, our pixilated reality.\n\nThe  idea goes as follows. That space itself our 3d living space are  actually particles and we are living in it, Unaware and unable to  getting out of those dimensions. The space-particles can stretch and  warp and move in higher dimensions. Using this analogy i am finally able  to visualize 11 dimension and understand it intuitively. Gravity, dark  energy &amp; dark matter also get a nice logical place in this idea.  Basically, it's just the density of those space particles, how stronger  the gravity, the denser those particles are. Having less space to move  around resulting in time moving slower. What a beautiful metaphor. Watch  the video.\n\n(my personal add on: Dark  Energy, is what i think just space particles, popping into existence.  The further the distance of an object, the space between contains more  space for a space particle to pop into existence, hence those far far  away galaxy's seem to fly away faster then the closer ones, due to space  itself is expanding.)\n\nHe even goes  beyond this, claiming to find the constants of nature using this model  and that they should arise natural from this model. Since i'm no  scientist and unfamiliar with the mathematics of it, i cannot confirm  anything, except that it sounds very simple and elegant. He proposed  using \"natural/universal\" numbers as measurement. Don't base our reality  on meters, but on planck length. 1 unit of planck length is 1. And  because of that many mathematically formula's become more straight  forward. I have this assumption that for example Pi and Phi might be a  \"clean\" beautiful number. Not ending in infinity as they do now..\n\nWhat  i find funny is that nobody (that i'm aware of) is talking of \"space\"  in such a manner, so i almost assume this model is disproven already?  Can anyone help me debunk this idea. At the moment i find it being the  best idea of what our universe is at the smallest and biggest scale  (more dimensions). Even that String theory is very elegant in the  \"particle\" sense, strings of energy and depending on how it vibrates it becomes a charm quark or a strange quark or whatever. But that the 11  dimensions curling up in itself, i find far fetched, it feels more like  an attempt of trying to find the answer to hard based on the wrong idea.  But as stated before, what do i know? :)\n\nSo,  2 things i want to accomplish here. \n\n1. Either make this idea more broadly  known. Perhaps my gut instinct is right about this. \n2. Or that someone  (you) will knock this idea out of my head, in case this model is simply wrong and that i've somehow missed  that due to my lack of education &amp;  knowledge about physics.\n\nTLDR;\n\nWatch the video (15 minutes long) and tell me what you think.  \nEdit: added another video for you to see. also 15 minutes long.  \n",

        "text": "I don't know where to post such a question, but I'm very curious about this. We humans like to think that we're the pinnacle or the end result of evolution, but I was wondering what kind of intelligent species would roam the Earth after, say, 1 million years from now.\n\nCould there be a species that is as intelligent compared to us as we are to houseflies? We think of houseflies as just acting on 'instinct'. But from their point of view they could be intelligent in the sense that when they sense something dangerous coming towards them, they quickly fly away and survive. So could there be a species which thinks of our actions as basic 'instincts' and their actions are completely unfathomable to us? For example, burning coal for electricity to power our cities would just be an 'instinct' for them. \n\nOne might say that a highly intelligent species would have habitable colonies in the entire solar system, or even the galaxy. But is that species really more intelligent than us or simply more technologically advanced? Ancient humans would view us as gods with our airplanes and such, but we are still the same species with the same capabilities. We are just 'luckier' because we had more time and were able to stand on the shoulders of giants. However, a colony of houseflies would never be able to be as advanced as us no matter how much time they were given. So I think we can safely say that we are more intelligent than houseflies.\n\nAnother interesting thing that I though about: People throughout centuries have thought about flying vehicles, even if they could not actually build them. In the same way, we think about interstellar travel or galatic civilisations, even if currently we have no means to achieve them. So suppose there's a species that is capable of interstellar travel: since we could _think_ about interstellar travel, the other species is not actually more _intelligent_ than us. They're simply more technologically advanced.\n\nSo is it entirely possible that we cannot even think about how a more intelligent species might be? Because if we say something like 'An intelligent species would be X', then we are at the same intelligence as the other species because we could _think_ about X.\n\nApologies if my question wasn't clear enough.",

Those are some initial thoughts I had about it. I think tentacles are probably likely?\n\nAnyways, I was wondering what sort of creatures they might be. I know creatures of these sizes are incredibly unrealistic, but so is magic and that's in my tabletop, so I'd like to design these creatures. I'd also like to exclude filling any gaps about their design (such as how their organs don't get crushed under all their muscle and meat and whatnot) with magic.\n\nSo given those creatures do exist, what would they be like? What sort of skin or scales or feathers would they have? Eating habits? Hibernation cycles? Reproduction?\n\nI know I want them to have growth on them. Probably small plantlife and maybe some critters on their back.\n\nleviathan: 1km in length.\n\nBehemoth: .75km in length. Girthy.\n\nZiz: .5km wingspan.

It got filled with water and drifted out into space.   Then when earth was formed it was dry, hot and barren.\n\nThen all of a sudden Chuck Norris comes Along and Round house kicks Mars So hard it collides with Earth.\n\nWhat would happen when the planets collide and have hardcore sex. While they are interlocked, could they exchange planetary fluids?\n\nI mean, think about it. you have 1 planet filled with water hitting an empty planet. when the 2 atompheres collide would their Shared Gravity cause the filled planet to start Draining water into the other one?\n\nI have a lot of Questions that I dont mind you guys debating.\n\nIf they are interlocked would there be no sense of up and down? like water flows down hill. Would it matter if the planets are Up and down or ()()Side to side during there intercourse?\n\nWhen the planets separate, does each planet take a part of the atmosphere with it?\n\nHow fast would the Drain take place.\n\nCould a planet be sucked dry during separation?\n\nNow I never mentions the size of planet 1 and planet 2.  Lets run a scenario for all 3 varibles.\n\n1. Water planet and dry planet are the same size.\n2. Water planet bigger, dry  planet smaller\n3. water plaent Smaller dry planet bigger\n\nIf you guys have any Laws of science that you can use to explain the math should any math be used, could you show the formulas?

        "text": "**My idea** is that our Universe is characterized by an infinite number of phenomenons happening continously. They happen for everyone, even if with our limited knowledge we can only experience a number of them. Time is a perceptive phenomenon which use is to compare and standardize the perceived speed of the events. But still, the events occur invariably. The flaw I perceive in my reasoning is: what is speed, then? If no time exists, object should all move equally, as speed is distance/time.\n\nIndeed, I see that Science seems to treat Time differently, as in the spacetime theory time is regarded as a dimension, something consistent and measurable. Also, \"my model\" wouldn't allow the contemporary existence of past and future events on the same plane of reality, because the events are happening in the present for everyone, while Einstein's theories hypothesized that a very distant observer in our current Universe (same plane of reality), could be ahead or behind our time.\n\nMy questions:\n\n\\- Why is time not a mere conventional and psychological event? Aren't the \"now\" events happing now for \"everyone\" in our Universe? If no, how could a math-based model demonstrate it and how strong are its conclusions?\n\n\\- Doesn't the scientific idea of time affect the principle of causality, when it allows the possibility that past, present and future events are happening simultaneously?\n\nPlease feel free to criticize my idea, as long as it helps me to understand what Science means with the word \"Time\".",
