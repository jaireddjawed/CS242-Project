        "text": "This is a Question I've been asking myself a lot lately. I used to be religious but this question has been drilling my mind more and more. \n\nWhy did God create Pain and Suffering? Why couldn't he just create heaven and make it a place for everyone without having people go through that \"Test\" to deserve a place in heaven. \n\nI mean he never HAD to create the Devil. He never HAD to create evil. I look at this world and see so much Pain and so much suffering. Famine, Genocide, Rape, Sorrow, Death, Torture. Children, the most innocent of us all are being treated horribly. Why? For what? And how after that can we believe that \"GOD loves his creation\". \n\nI don't mean to be Disrespectful towards God and Religion but I'm not sure what to do... ",

        "text": "Unity. Both theological and societal. \n\nIf one is to take a textually autonomous approach to the Qur'an and the 5 pillars, one will soon see that Islam as the Qur'an defines it is neither a strict, nor legalistic religion. \n\n1. Shahada - the declaration of faith is almost identical to the Hebrew Shema, which is included in Christian scripture as one of the most important commandments. \n\n2. Salah - worship is perscribed within the Qur'an as something to be done regularly, but what this entails is not emphasized and, therefore, if one is to take the textually autonomous approach, it is subjective. \n\n3. Zakat - work, in many ways similar to karma yoga and Buddhist right livelihood, is, in the Qur'an very different from the popular concept of \"charity\". Zakat is a constant endeavor to improve your life and the lives of those around you.\n\n4. Siyam - fasting is not only abstinence from food, but all indulgences and compulsions. \n\n5. Hajj - believed by many Islamaphobes to be idol worship, it is instead a demonstration of unity and common power through common belief. \n",

        "text": "I recently reached out to the Bahai church in my city about attending services to learn more since I'm curious about religions, but the person I emailed basically said I could only attend a Bahai workbook session at someone's home. I wasn't comfortable with this, so I tried asking more questions, but she firmly said that any questions I had would be answered during the workbook sessions and that millions of people had completed these books. So my questions here (since googling for \"Bahai workbooks\" doesn't turn up much useful) are:\n\n\\- Are you affiliated with the Bahai church?- Have you completed the Bahai workbooks?\n\n\\- If so, what did you learn, how did you feel?- What is the purpose/goal of the workbooks? Once you complete them do you get to attend other services? Get access to scriptures? Do you become a member of the church? Do you achieve the equivalent of enlightenment or guarantee your place in Heaven? Do you achieve some rank or position?\n\n\\- Does Bahai involve any other practices/services/community events other than workbooks?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you - I genuinely mean no disrespect - but I want to know more about what Bahai does rather than ideas I can read about from Wikipedia.  \n\n\n**Edit: Thank you for the helpful information from Bahai members. Have any non-members of Bahai done these workbooks?**",

Most theories in classical physics can be derived from quantum mechanics as an approximation valid at large (macroscopic) scale.\\[3\\] Quantum mechanics differs from classical physics in that: energy, momentum and other quantities of a system may be restricted to discrete values (quantization), objects have characteristics of both particles and waves (wave-particle duality), and there are limits to the precision with which quantities can be known (uncertainty principle).\\[note 1\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuantum mechanics gradually arose from theories to explain observations which could not be reconciled with classical physics, such as Max Planck's solution in 1900 to the black-body radiationproblem, and from the correspondence between energy and frequency in Albert Einstein's 1905 paper which explained the photoelectric effect. Early quantum theory was profoundly re-conceived in the mid-1920s by Erwin Schrödinger, Werner Heisenberg, Max Born and others. The modern theory is formulated in various specially developed mathematical formalisms. In one of them, a mathematical function, the wave function, provides information about the probability amplitude of position, momentum, and other physical properties of a particle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImportant applications of quantum theory\\[5\\] include quantum chemistry, quantum optics, quantum computing, superconducting magnets, light-emitting diodes, and the laser, the transistor andsemiconductors such as the microprocessor, medical and research imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging and electron microscopy. Explanations for many biological and physical phenomena are rooted in the nature of the chemical bond, most notably the macro-molecule DNA.\\[6\\]\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum\\_mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MANY-WORLDS INTERPRETATION**\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/lz876yxy2ol11.jpg\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe many-worlds interpretation is an interpretation of quantum mechanics that asserts the objective reality of the universal wavefunction and denies the actuality of wavefunction collapse. Many-worlds implies that all possible alternate histories and futures are real, each representing an actual \"world\" (or \"universe\"). In layman's terms, the hypothesis states there is a very large—perhaps infinite\\[2\\]—number of universes, and everything that could possibly have happened in our past, but did not, has occurred in the past of some other universe or universes. The theory is also referred to as MWI, the relative state formulation, the Everett interpretation, the theory of the universal wavefunction, many-universes interpretation, multiverse theory or just many-worlds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe original relative state formulation is due to Hugh Everett in 1957.\\[3\\]\\[4\\] Later, this formulation was popularized and renamed many-worlds by Bryce Seligman DeWitt in the 1960s and 1970s.\\[1\\]\\[5\\]\\[6\\]\\[7\\] The decoherence approaches to interpreting quantum theory have been further explored and developed,\\[8\\]\\[9\\]\\[10\\] becoming quite popular. MWI is one of many multiverse hypotheses in physics and philosophy. It is currently considered a mainstream interpretation along with the other decoherence interpretations, collapse theories (including the historical Copenhagen interpretation),\\[11\\] and hidden variable theories such as the Bohmian mechanics.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore many-worlds, reality had always been viewed as a single unfolding history. Many-worlds, however, views historical reality as a many-branched tree, wherein every possible quantum outcome is realised.\\[12\\] Many-worlds reconciles the observation of non-deterministic events, such as random radioactive decay, with the fully deterministic equations of quantum physics.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn many-worlds, the subjective appearance of wavefunction collapse is explained by the mechanism of quantum decoherence, and this is supposed to resolve all of the correlation paradoxes of quantum theory, such as the EPR paradox\\[13\\]\\[14\\] and Schrödinger's cat,\\[1\\] since every possible outcome of every event defines or exists in its own \"history\" or \"world\".\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds\\_interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Schrodinger’s Cat**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSchrödinger's cat is a thought experiment, sometimes described as a paradox, devised by Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1935.\\[1\\] It illustrates what he saw as the problem of theCopenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics applied to everyday objects. The scenario presents a cat that may be simultaneously both alive and dead,\\[2\\]\\[3\\]\\[4\\]\\[5\\]\\[6\\]\\[7\\]\\[8\\] a state known as a quantum superposition, as a result of being linked to a random subatomic event that may or may not occur. The thought experiment is also often featured in theoretical discussions of the interpretations of quantum mechanics. Schrödinger coined the term Verschränkung (entanglement) in the course of developing the thought experiment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Double-Slit Experiment**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn modern physics, the double-slit experiment is a demonstration that light and matter can display characteristics of both classically defined waves and particles; moreover, it displays the fundamentally probabilistic nature of quantum mechanical phenomena. The original experiment was performed by Davisson and Germer in 1927.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe double-slit experiment was first performed by Thomas Young in 1801. His experiment was part of classical physics, well before quantum mechanics and the concept of wave-particle duality. He believed it demonstrated that the wave theory of light was correct, and his experiment is sometimes referred to as Young's experiment\\[1\\] or Young's slits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe experiment belongs to a general class of \"double path\" experiments, in which a wave is split into two separate waves that later combine into a single wave. Changes in the path lengths of both waves result in a phase shift, creating an interference pattern. Another version is the Mach–Zehnder interferometer, which splits the beam with a mirror.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the basic version of this experiment, a coherent light source, such as a laser beam, illuminates a plate pierced by two parallel slits, and the light passing through the slits is observed on a screen behind the plate.\\[2\\]\\[3\\] The wave nature of light causes the light waves passing through the two slits to interfere, producing bright and dark bands on the screen — a result that would not be expected if light consisted of classical particles.\\[2\\]\\[4\\] However, the light is always found to be absorbed at the screen at discrete points, as individual particles (not waves), the interference pattern appearing via the varying density of these particle hits on the screen.\\[5\\] Furthermore, versions of the experiment that include detectors at the slits find that each detected photon passes through one slit (as would a classical particle), and not through both slits (as would a wave).\\[6\\]\\[7\\]\\[8\\]\\[9\\]\\[10\\] However, such experiments demonstrate that particles do not form the interference pattern if one detects which slit they pass through. These results demonstrate the principle of wave–particle duality.\\[11\\]\\[12\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther atomic-scale entities, such as electrons, are found to exhibit the same behavior when fired towards a double slit.\\[3\\] Additionally, the detection of individual discrete impacts is observed to be inherently probabilistic, which is inexplicable using classical mechanics.\\[3\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe experiment can be done with entities much larger than electrons and photons, although it becomes more difficult as size increases. The largest entities for which the double-slit experiment has been performed were molecules that each comprised 810 atoms (whose total mass was over 10,000 atomic mass units).\\[13\\]\\[14\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe double-slit experiment (and its variations) has become a classic thought experiment, for its clarity in expressing the central puzzles of quantum mechanics. Because it demonstrates the fundamental limitation of the ability of the observer to predict experimental results, Richard Feynman called it \"a phenomenon which is impossible \\[…\\] to explain in any classical way, and which has in it the heart of quantum mechanics. In reality, it contains the only mystery \\[of quantum mechanics\\].\"\\[3\\]\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit\\_experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle (also known as Heisenberg's uncertainty principle) is any of a variety of mathematical inequalities\\[1\\] asserting a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle, known as complementary variables, such as position x and momentum p, can be known.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIntroduced first in 1927, by the German physicist Werner Heisenberg, it states that the more precisely the position of some particle is determined, the less precisely its momentum can be known, and vice versa.\\[2\\] The formal inequality relating the standard deviation of position σx and the standard deviation of momentum σp was derived by Earle Hesse Kennard\\[3\\] later that year and by Hermann Weyl\\[4\\] in 1928:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHistorically, the uncertainty principle has been confused\\[5\\]\\[6\\] with a somewhat similar effect in physics, called the observer effect, which notes that measurements of certain systems cannot be made without affecting the systems, that is, without changing something in a system. Heisenberg utilized such an observer effect at the quantum level (see below) as a physical \"explanation\" of quantum uncertainty.\\[7\\] It has since become clearer, however, that the uncertainty principle is inherent in the properties of all wave-like systems,\\[8\\] and that it arises in quantum mechanics simply due to the matter wave nature of all quantum objects. Thus, the uncertainty principle actually states a fundamental property of quantum systems, and is not a statement about the observational success of current technology.\\[9\\] It must be emphasized that measurement does not mean only a process in which a physicist-observer takes part, but rather any interaction between classical and quantum objects regardless of any observer.\\[10\\]\\[note 1\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince the uncertainty principle is such a basic result in quantum mechanics, typical experiments in quantum mechanics routinely observe aspects of it. Certain experiments, however, may deliberately test a particular form of the uncertainty principle as part of their main research program. These include, for example, tests of number–phase uncertainty relations in superconducting\\[12\\] or quantum optics\\[13\\] systems. Applications dependent on the uncertainty principle for their operation include extremely low-noise technology such as that required in gravitational wave interferometers.\\[14\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty\\_principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**THE MEASUREMENT PROBLEM**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe quantum measurement problem ultimately shows the inseparability of the observer from the observed. There is no measurable, solid reality “out there” independent of the measurer. What is “out there” when we’re not looking is an infinite wavy cloud of criss-crossing possibilities. Then when we focus our attention on something, the wave function collapses into a defined particle in a definite location for us to observe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“This rather simple experiment raises a central question about the role of the observer in quantum reality. This is known as the quantum measurement problem: We infer that the photon acts like a wave when we’re not looking, but we never actually see those waves. So what causes the photon to ‘collapse’ into a particle when we do decide to look at it? In classical physics, objects are regarded as objectively real and independent of the observer. In the quantum world, this is no longer the case.” -Dean Radin, “Entangled Minds” (218)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPhysicist Fred Alan Wolf uses the term “popping the quiff” (QWF for Quantum Wave Function) to describe the role of the observer in creating reality. Before being consciously observed, quanta (the building blocks of all matter) exist only as a boundary-less wave of undifferentiated quantum energy. In this state there is no matter as such, no particles or “things” with attributes and definite locations - just an infinite expanse of energy, Zero-Point, The Field. However, when a conscious observer focuses attention, they “pop the quiff,” collapse the quantum wave function into a solid particle of experience with definable attributes and location.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese findings are so significant because they prove that the classical Newtonian model of physics (now being termed “the old physics”) is fundamentally flawed. The old physics described a mechanistic material universe “out there” existing regardless of whether or not there was a conscious being alive to perceive it. The new physics shows that matter doesn’t even exist without consciousness. Without a conscious observer to “pop the quiff,” there is no substance, no “materiality” to that which is – just an unlimited, undifferentiated field of energy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“If you want to see fear in a quantum physicist’s eyes, just mention the words, ‘the measurement problem.’ The measurement problem is this: an atom only appears in a particular place if you measure it. In other words, an atom is spread out all over the place until a conscious observer decides to look at it. So the act of measurement or observation creates the entire universe.” -Jim Al-Khalili, Nuclear Physicist\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I’m not opposed to the idea of Bible and heaven and hell and Jesus and so on but I find it uncomfortable to fully believe in something I don’t have any evidence is true. It’s funny though, even though I don’t necessarily believe in (or know) what’s to come for the afterlife I’m MORBIDLY afraid that because I don’t fully believe in something that I will be punished. (Honestly though I’m so terribly afraid of NOT knowing what is next!) I don’t know what to do with myself. I feel I sin everyday according to the catholic faith (or Christian I honestly was don’t know the complete difference) but I overall feel I’m a pretty level headed person who makes good choices over bad choices. I’m impulsive but I always try to do the better thing even if I’m unhappy in the outcome. ",

It seems to me that Jesus never actually spoke of being a mystical type of person that people portray.  I think his message and parables were more of a political statement for the people of the time.  The Romans were known to be oppressive to Jews and Jesus spoke out against them and their political agendas that ultimately sealed his fate.  I think the Bible has some great life lessons and proverbs that every man should live by so I still want to attend church and religious meetings.  Is there any branch of Christianity that doesn't view Jesus as a \"God\" because I would be interested in an offshoot that looks at that possibility.  As we are entering a new era of enlightenment I think we should explore all possibilities and this needs to be brought to people's attention.  Any thoughts would be appreciated, thanks.",

We are open to finding a church that suits us, but my strong beliefs regarding the issues mentioned earlier are stopping me from going all in to an organized religion. \n\nI suppose that some more modern non-denominational or \"born again\" Christian churches may be more socially liberal, but what I've found from experience is more of an evangelical vibe. Anyone have any suggestions? ",

        "text": "7 weeks ago my partner died suddenly before the day of our first anniversary. He was a gay 26 year old male. He had epilepsy which meant he was on disability benefits. He died after a particularly bad seizure and hit his head. He didnt believe in religion but believed there was an afterlife. So i would say he was agnostic at worst. \n\nTo be perfectly honest i dont know what i believe in. But i know i need to have faith that one day i may get to see him again. But there is a nagging feeling within me that either is no afterlife and that this is it. Or there is one but he wont be in heaven because of what the bible says. I have debated with many people on wether or not those particular teachings of the old testament should even be acknowledged since a lot of others arent either. Like eating shellfish and working on the Sabbath for example. As someone who grew up christian and went to a Roman catholic school in Scotland i know what i have been taught. \n\nI cannot fathom any reason why he should be in hell. My partner was a kind hearted individual who saw the best in everyone, the type who would loan a friend money if they were in need when he did not have a lot himself. And encouraged everyone he loved to be the best they could be. As i said earlier he couldnt work due to his epilepsy but instead spent his days volunteering for lgbt youth centres, cancer research charity shops and over the past few years even visiting his grandmother every day to make sure she was doing ok and taking her out to lunch as she had begun to develop dementia. He even volunteered as a chaperone for troubled youth by accompanying them to and from school in taxis. He was the type of individual who was loud, funny and was a huge part of the local lgbt community. Myself and his mother only discovered after he had passed that he had a direct debit set up so that a donation would ve made to cancer research uk every month. As far as we are aware it had been there for years.  As a partner he was someone i completely fell for. He was loving, kind, patient. In a whole year of being together we never once fought. We annoyed each other at times like all couples do but we would work them out. He was someone i looked to for support and strength and i would do the same for him whenever he needed it. One of my favourite memories is us sitting on a couch eating breakfast and watching tv. And he just kissed me and said how lucky he was to have me. \n\nAn idea ive heard on the afterlife that ive kept to make me feel better is that where we go depends on what god thinks but also on how others remember us once we are gone. Meaning if people remember the wonderful person you were you will go to heaven and if they remember you as evil you go to hell. Does anyone have any thoughts on this???",

        "text": "God\r\n\r\nThe idea of a supreme being/s that has built everything around us has followed us ever since prehistory. I believe I have opened my mind up enough to fit some very important pieces of this eternal puzzle together. I may not be the first, which is preferred because I wouldn’t want to look crazy. If there is a chance of looking a bit crazy, it would be nice be guided away from that path.\r\n\r\nThere is something called the collective unconscious, which was an idea founded by Carl G. Jung. It is the knowledge passed on through our ancestral lineage through millions of generations. I would consciously perceive its existence as instinct. There may be other things that are part of it, but that is not my focus yet. When we developed vocal language, we were able to teach others without having to show them. We began to tell moralistic stories which started to form larger functional groups of people, outside of our family groups. When we began to write, we were able to form a more tangible form of telling stories. We had already many stories to begin with, but with a written scripture, stories would be able to evolve with less confusion or misinterpretation. They would become books of moralistic stories, and wether the stories were real or not, they delivered the moral value nonetheless. As long as we were able to understand it’s meaning and purpose. We needed to perceive these stories the proper way, which is why we looked to our elders for wisdom. They knew the right way to perceive the teachings that religions offered. Once religion began to become more extensive, people needed to focus their lives studying the religion. We have always given it much importance but now we forgot why. Societies evolve to fit best to its environment, some may die but other come from its ashes. Religion also evolves with societies which is why we cannot go and adopt another’s. It is like trying to force a puzzle piece that will never fit, and if it were forced to, it would look ugly and out of place. I will try to only talk about the Christian religion because it is the one I know best.\r\nThe Christian religion fits into modern society but only if it were to be willing to evolve with it. The collective pride amongst its members has destroyed it by trying to focus on what never mattered in the first place. They focused on perceiving it in a physically literal way. It wouldn’t lose its moral value, but it would never evolve either. Like anything that has ever lived, if it does not evolve,  then it dies. Time would kill it. Its value would decrease to us, because the morality wouldn’t correlate with the evolution of society. The breaking apart of Christianity was never a mistake, it was just groups of society trying to evolve. Just like animal and plant evolution, if they are not functional they live short life’s. You can see the importance of religion in society because of the functional state of the society. This would mean that the process of evolution for society isn’t a constant and linear process. It is filled with chaos, which is the clash of new and old norms. It has to be a battle between two strong point of views, so society makes correct progress. We need both to be strong, but only one will emerge triumphantly. Religion seems to be a guide to this, which means our society is built on many moral foundations entrusted to religion. The moral foundations need to  become more complex to be able to meet society’s standards for stability. It is why we may not just throw it away completely and still live a truly fulfilled life.\r\nAt this point we see nothing that meets our standards, and with time things would have to become more chaotic. Like with anything, the process of chaos giving birth to progress will go on until it reaches perfection if that may ever exists. We need to learn to look at society and its relationship to religion in a more realistic way. See how they correlate, and by what indestructible strings they are attached by. We need to stop looking at the word, religion, and continue thinking of it as conflict with each other. We must see it as a tool for progress, and learn how it can help us grow. We would have to build a new “Bible” to align us with the right way of living together. Once we figure this out we will be able to skip many chaotic moments between each other as we strive towards perfection. As a societal group, we collectively decide the speed of which we reach this impossible goal. It is such an important thing to realize in our confused society. I think if we don’t learn to bow in respect to what our ancestors have built, then will be forced to by the harsh process of evolution to bow, once there’s been enough chaos. That is why progress is born from it.\r\nAfter giving it much thought I have made it one of my missions to try to give my part in this. I must at least try to help society evolve. Everything starts somewhere, and I mind as well give it a shot. As of now I may look foolish trying to reach to the infinity of the heavens while I stand on the ground, and I will continue. I have to be a fool in order to learn, and in order to become better. We are in an age when people must know, because we are not content on just believing in things without reason. We demand a more tangible and concrete meaning for spirituality. When we learn to do this, we will find a renewed meaning of life. Humanity would live more peacefully until we run into another wall. There seems to be a way of finding the missing piece of our never ending puzzle. I hope we may find it soon to avoid much disorder, but I will welcome anything life has to offer.\r\nReligion is an important guide for an individual which leads to the society. These individuals are what gives birth to societies with the norms they all agree to follow individually. With the guide of morality they build new norms that lead to progress. Wether we need to make up new words or learn to decipher our religion in a wise way. We need to do something and not lose something built into us.\r\n",

        "text": "Religion. \n\nIt is something that we gave ourselves to give our lives direction. Some of us, if we did not have religion, would be lost sheep wandering in the pastures not sure of where home is or where safety is. For quite some time, as my studies have continued to higher institutions, I have pursued my own personal self-study of religion and what place does it hold in my life. \n\nI was raised Christian Baptist in the state of Mississippi in the middle of the Bible Belt of the United States. I attended church every Sunday as a teenager, sang in the choir for my Lord, praised dance in honour of my Savior Jesus Christ, spoke of what He, the Father, and the Holy Spirit has done for me in my time of need. For the longest, I believed that my God was the one and true God. That there were no other gods worth serving, that all other gods that everyone served were, dare I say it, “fake”. I used to worry for the poor souls who did not serve MY GOD whom I believed was the only one worth serving. But as I grew older and began my self-study, that idea began to be challenged. \n\nI began to wonder what if everyone was onto something? What if it is possible that other gods are present in this world. The Bible says “Do not have other gods besides Me. Do not make an idol for yourself whether in the shape of anything in the heavens above or on the earth below or in the waters under the earth. You must not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God…” (Exodus 20:3-6). This set of verses informed me that not only was I wrong in thinking that my God was the only god, but also that these other gods were by no means fake. They are very real. It is just a matter of do I want to take that risk.\n\nMore questions appeared as one day I allowed myself to think too deeply. I had the thought of this, “What if the Buddhists are praying to Buddha, Hindis pray to Kali, Egyptians pray to Bastet, Muslims pray to Allah, and I pray to my God, Yahweh. Who is to say that when we pray to all of these entities, we are not all praying to the same entity? Who is to say that all religions are the same?” These thoughts came to me when I realized that a lot of these religions including Christianity are the same. They all run the same story line with very few details different. And then also a friend of mine gave me another thought. Where you are born, when you were born, and how you were raised helps determine your religious background…And that in itself poses a issue because say a Buddhist does before learning of Christ…where does he/she go?",

        "text": "So, oft in theologic wars \nThe disputants, I ween, \nRail on in utter ignorance \nOf what each other mean; \nAnd prate about an Elephant \nNot one of them has seen!\n\nBlind Men and the Elephant – Philosophical Parable\nThe Blind Men and the Elephant is an ancient parable used today as a warning for people that promote absolute truth or exclusive religious claims. The simple reason is that our sensory perceptions and life experiences can lead to limited access and overreaching misinterpretations. How can a person with a limited touch of truth turn that into the one and only version of all reality?\n\nBlind Men and the Elephant – Theological Truth\nWhen it comes to the moral of the Blind Men and the Elephant, it seems that today’s philosophers end their agenda too quickly. Doesn’t the picture of the blind men and the elephant also point to something bigger -- The elephant? Indeed, each blind man has a limited perspective on the objective truth, but that doesn’t mean objective truth isn’t there. In fact, truth isn’t relative at all… It’s there to discover in all its totality. In theology, just because we have limited access to Truth, that doesn’t mean any and all versions of Truth are equally valid. Actually, if we know the Whole Elephant is out there, shouldn’t this drive us to open our eyes wider and seek every opportunity to experience more of Him?\nAny thoughts are welcome.",

        "text": "I am not trying to force what I had just thought on the following, this is but a theory and a view of mine.  You are welcome to discuss on it of course, but again, I am not promoting anything Religious, just a theory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt has occurred to me that God may well be in fact, the one and only God in \\*all\\* religions and cultures period.  This is how I came to realize being that in almost every culture known to man old and modern, there is always an entity ABOVE all that rules and watches over.  The Greeks/Romans had Zeus/Jupiter, Egyptians had Amon, and so on.  Calling them \"king of gods\" may just be a mortal statement, for I am leaning more as a fatherly being who created it all and oversees it more than interacting with.  Now I know Bible scriptures state that God came to man and warned of false deities and to praise him above else, but my view of it all is that God is represented differently in \\*all\\* diverse religions, whether or not I am wrong on this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGod can also be represented differently in terms of gender, who is to say God is a he anyway?  Now I am sure my theory on this is stupid, because as I stated, ancient scriptures go on depicting God as being the only true God and to stop adoring false deities and such, but I don't have a say on who wrote said scriptures and how exact they are on such terms being that they have been written by man as well anyway.  I am not going against my beliefs on this level of skepticism, I am simply stating that pretty much we all don't know much about God as it is, no matter how much it has been written about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike I said, maybe God is one and the same and is just represented differently by all cultures on this world.",

        "text": "For a few years I have been thinking about he origins of baptism and the purpose and I cant really find much.  My thought on this is that baptism was a way of ancient people having a near death experience.  Basically I think a priest would hold them underwater until the point of unconsciousness and then that's why they say after baptism you are \"born again\".  Are there any theories similar to this because this is the only thing that makes sense to me for baptism in a spiritual aspect.",

What does this mean and why are they on every door, some doors have double crosses.",
