So the original poster gets shafted, and the reposter basically mines Karma off of someone else's work.\n\nTruth be told, I always downvote the reposter.  But what if the original poster got credit for being reposted?  While I'd love to propose that all the Karma from the repost goes to the original poster, I'm pretty sure that wouldn't be a popular idea.  So why not half?

If knowledge of chinese companies were more common like google/amazon/facebook im sure they would litter places like /r/latestagecapitalism to change it into anti china sub essentially distracting from the fuckery of places like facebook, banks etc for an image of glorious \"insert country here\".\n\nEvery thread about the economy or how hard it is to live will always have a highly engaged &amp; one sided discussion on how terrible the chinese are. Its not controversial at all. \n\nIts seems as if the combination of being seen as inferior (subconsciously), exotic/foreign, &amp; a legitimate threat both economically and geopolitically encourages tribalistic behavior to find a scapegoat and the Chinese being seen as both inferior and a threat(weird right?) is the perfect target. A common occurrence in places where the economy is turning sour is to turn on foreigners after all.\n\nI personally see this sentiment more strongly in asian american communities as well (publicly anyway, \"im asian so I can say this stuff\") trying to deflect the hate and to show loyalty to tribe america lest they lose all the respect and inclusiveness each generation of asian americans worked so hard for (still aint perfect tho).\n\nThis is a common occurrence by the way \"The narcissism of small differences\" was seen in most american immigrants from the irish, italian, south american, and asians. \n\nIf i were to use reddit as a litmus test for american sentiments towards the chinese, it seems as if the general consensus is the beginning of a new [\"yellow terror\"](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/YellowTerror.jpg/350px-YellowTerror.jpg)\n\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nThis thread was prompted after listening to this podcast about tribalism by NPR\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2018/03/09/591895426/the-mind-of-the-village-understanding-our-implicit-biases",

Doesn't feel that way to me.\n\nOf course, being that white culture is the dominant culture, I can't subjugate minorities for making their own communities/subreddits even if the content isn't race specific.

As a consequence of that, the more you read, the lower the quality of posts that you will see. So why is there such a dense set of porn after a point?\n\nThe answer is very simple: horny people will go through all of the popular nsfw subreddits and upvote new posts as they come in at a steady rate, meaning that all of those new posts will rise at the same rate, sticking (pun unintended) closely together.\n\nI personally use this to know when I have sorted through the most worthwhile posts for the time being: if there are more people jacking off on reddit than there are reading a certain post, that post is probably very niche or low-quality. My next question would be to ask whether people notice this porn line changing at key times, like right after work or around bed time in various high-traffic locations, i.e. can reddit determine when people are jerking off more?",

He said “no impossible. Check your carbon oxide meter.” Turns out I am slowly being poisoned and that’s why I must leave le reddit. My last words are Bernie can still win.\")\n\nThis guy is obviously making fun of the use of \"le\" on reddit, which is an old trope. Now I don't know if you guys remember the times when \"le\" was used a lot on reddit, it was during the golden age of rage comics, i.e., when they were all across the frontpage and not in dedicated subs, and the use of \"le\" in them was very common--which led people to use it in comments. After a while however, people grew tired of it and started making fun of people who used \"le\", and the word was very quickly not used at all anymore, except in subs like /r/circlejerk.\n\nNow, I don't remember exactly when all of this happened, but it was many, many years ago--closer to when I started using reddit, and I've been here for more than 10 years. And yet, if you look at this guy's account age, it's around 6 months old.\n\nWhich makes me wonder, does this guy have several accounts, and he's decided to beat a dead horse? Or, are users on /r/circlejerk parroting each other, not even really understanding what they're making fun of anymore?\n\nI'm inclined to think the second option is more likely.",

Eventually reddit changed this, and allowed r/ to link subreddits as well. \"Official\" uses were still shown as /r/, as seen in this screenshot of moderated subreddits [here](http://i.imgur.com/GlIDFxl.png) (from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/3fx399/reddit_change_quarantined_subreddits/)). Eventually, reddit itself changed. The first ever official use of \"r/\" was [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4dqxgt/reddit_mobile_apps/) post, about the official mobile app... [Every] official (https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/4kuk2j/reddit_change_introducing_image_uploading_beta/) reddit announcement, post, or basically any time a subreddit is shown, it is shown with r/. The list of moderated subreddits are listed with r/, the subreddits on /r/all are listed with r/, etc.\n\nAfter the mobile users were allowed to type r/, almost *every* mobile user begun typing it as r/. New users came in, saw that a lot of people were linking subreddits with r/, and also begun doing it. After the rapid influx of (mobile) users in the past 2 years, basically half the site was linking subreddits with r/. Seeing this, reddit pandered to those new users and completely changed how they linked subreddits. You can look at someone typing r/ and that user will almost be guaranteed to be either a mobile user or a new account.\n\nI know this is a silly thing to care about, but it's not about the linking itself. That's a very minor issue. It's about how reddit is focusing 90% of their effort onto mobile users. 90% of the posts on /r/changelog are mobile updates. The redesign was created to bridge the gap for mobile users, making the site look more like a mobile app. ",
