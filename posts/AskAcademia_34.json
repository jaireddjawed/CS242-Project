I know that ETH Zurich has a very high pay (And yes, I am aware that living costs are also high in Zurich).\n\nSo to rephrase, I want to know which universities have the best **and/or** the highest pays for PhD.

Which one of these is the least harmful to the process? Are there other options I should be considering? \n\nThank you!",

Okay, for this I get the privilege of formally advising grad students. That's definitely good, but the soft money part bothers me. I've written a few successful grant proposals before, but it's seemed like success is random and relying on that for your career long term sounds scary. Also, you have to continuously shape your research agenda to fit whatever the sponsors will fund that year. How can you build anything long term that way? \n\nThere are a few \"Research Faculty\" at my school and I asked them, they said they would do anything else and were always actively looking for a full time position and strongly recommended against taking this job unless it was my only option. It isn't, but it is my only academic option, so, does anyone have a positive opinion of these kinds of jobs, beyond \"maybe eventually you can get a real job?\" ",

I reached out to the organizer and she said I can earn a certificate for participating and I can also be part of the youth forum, which sounds exciting. I'm still an undergrad, heck I'm in community college almost ready to transfer to university. And then today she offered me the role as a moderator for the event. Excited, I took it! I said sure, I don't mind inviting speakers/chairs to the floor. But then again, me.... Why ask me? I don't think I'm credible enough to have such a role. I mean, my extracurricular game is strong and I'm in Speech &amp; Debate, but still. Also, in the beginning the address wasn't there--it just said Los Angeles. When I asked the organizer, she updated the site to Embassy Suites. Then today, after offering me the role as moderator, she told me it is now Crowne Plaza to suit accomodations... Which sounds okay, I guess. By the way, I live in LA and the organizer claims to live in England.

My wife and I are considering a lifestyle change which involves moving somewhere a relatively short distance away which has a better quality of life (we think) whilst still being 90 mins to 2 hours from home, family etc. \n\nThis area has a big uni, and I idly wondered the other day If I could make the jump to teaching (as my profession is something a lot of people study at degree level). I then idly googled jobs at aforementioned uni and, what do you know, they're advertising for an associate lecturer position in my field. \n\nNow, I've done a bit of research and, as I understand it, *associate* lecturer level doesn't require a PhD. I'm also not degree level educated in the field but I do hold a professional qualification so am hoping that supersedes this requirement. \n\nOh, also I have no teaching experience. \n\nIn short, I'm not really thinking that this particular one is a goer (also the whole \"would need to sell my house pdq\" and move \"aw wouldn't it be lovely if we moved here\" to \"let's do this\" in record time thing is probably an issue) but it has got me thinking about whether this could be something to look at in the medium term. \n\nCouple of questions I'm hoping some of you might be able to answer;\n\n1. What additional qualifications or experience might I need to get to make this kind of move?\n\n2. Looks like the associate lecturer pay situation is a fairly hefty pay cut from what I do now. That's fine - I accept that making a quality of life move will probably come with a financial penalty but a man's got bills to pay and a kid to feed (soon to be two). As it happens I've got a pretty good lead into some pretty lucrative seasonal contracting work I could do to supplement my income which would complement the uni term structure (here in the UK at least) quite nicely. How feasible (or totally not is this)?\n\nReally appreciate any help any of you might be able to give. \n\nCheers",

        "text": "My friend is a STEM PhD student, whose adviser asked him to modify data for a publication. Note that this version of the paper has not yet been submitted to a journal. The student was asked by the adviser to modify data in a couple ways.\n\nFirst, is scaling raw data by multiple orders of magnitude, and then presenting the scaled data as if it was raw data, without any reference to a scaling factor.\n\nSecond, is more complicated. It involves taking the difference between two signals, shifting the difference by an offset, setting the new values to zero if below a threshold, shifting these values around in time, and then reconstructing the original two signals using these processed values. The processed results look significantly \"better\" than the raw data. The paper has no reference to the processing of these signals, and it is implied that they are raw data.\n\nWhat should the student do? He has already complained to the adviser, but adviser dismissed this type of modification as \"normal.\"\n\nMy friend hesitates to push the issue further, because another PhD student in his lab is trying to defend a thesis based on this work, and he does not want to prevent the other student from graduating. Both my friend and this other PhD student (who are both co-first-authors of this paper) have zero publications (first author or otherwise).\n\nIf the paper is under review at a top journal, and then the other PhD student will look better during their thesis defense. The student thinks that the paper will almost certainly be rejected because the paper is riddled with other problems (lack of clarity, odd nonstandard ways of defining things, leaving out information necessary to reproduce the data - see a pattern here?). My friend thinks that after the paper is rejected, then they can redo the experiments legitimately, or be more transparent about the data modification.\n\nWhat should my friend do?\n\nSome more background: Both my friend and his fellow labmate are 5 years into their PhDs. His research group has not published a single paper in multiple years, despite normal and consistent effort by the PI and many PhD students. The overall work is legitimate, but not groundbreaking, but the PI refuses to submit it to anything below Nature, Science, and their respective subjournals. The paper has already been rejected \\~5 times, and they are resubmitting the paper to a top journal that rejected it. In the most recent version of the paper, the PI greatly inflated the claims of the paper compared to previous versions.\n\nIn general, the research has been hindered by the PI. He is a micromanager, and treats all PhD students like technicians. He meets with each student \\~3 times a day, makes all creative decisions, and does not allow his students to even write their own papers (the paper above in question was written entirely by the PI). He often makes irrational decisions, and aggressively defends them, resorting to yelling and personal insults. The list goes on. Overall, the PhD experience has been described a nightmare for my friend, and he is desperately trying to graduate, even if it means with no publications.",

I send e-mails about weekly, and occasionally get replies about how busy they are, how they have other deadlines, and occasionally a little feedback. I'm currently in the last year of my postdoc and looking for new jobs, but haven't published anything new in awhile. I need this paper to go out. I brought our other coauthors in about two weeks ago, but they've agreed to just contribute as former advisor sees fit. Despite him being cc'd on all of that, I havent heard directly from him in over a month.\n\nI have a job application due this week, and I've been basically begging for feedback/permission to submit every other day. Do I just set a deadline? I'm a bit shy on the draw here because I tried the same thing with my dissertation and it didn't go over well. Every time I try to be assertive with former advisor it seems to deteriorate our relationship even further.\n\nWhat do I do? I have three more manuscripts that are basically ready to go, but again, need his approval. Any advice on how to set deadlines for people who have ignored every deadline you've ever set for them? How do I communicate that this is a problem for me that has to change? ",

I am 25 years old and this past May I graduated with an M.Ed. in Human Development and Psychology (with a concentration in individual counseling) from Harvard University. My intention in doing this was to prepare myself to apply for Ph.D. programs in counseling psychology. I want to counsel, I know this firmly through the education and professional experience I have gained. However, I feel the need to prepare myself for the likely reality that I will not get into a Ph.D. program because of how competitive they are. \n\nIf I do not get into a Ph.D. program, what are my other options if I want to still be a “counselor psychologist”. More specifically, is there anything I can do with this stupid M.Ed.? I took a year’s worth of counseling classes, but was not in a “licensure program” so all I really have to show for it is some fancy diploma. Do I just need to start over and get an MSW at this point? \n\nThanks for the feedback everyone!",

I can handle other people being generally arrogant, I don’t care much about that itself, but it’s when they start projecting onto me that I feel really embarassed and annoyed about it.

It strikes me that the academy as we know it, in both the East and the West, is regarded  more as an industry than a tenet of civilization. That is, all academic opinion and research is ultimately beholden to the powers that fund it, whether these be commercial or political. There may be conflicting opinions – probably sponsored by different powers – but there appear to be no opinions that are truly independent. All effort goes to where funding is made available by the academies' masters. If a government declares an area to be out of bounds for research – psychedelic drugs, for example – the academies are forced to avoid it. Though scientific rigour may be our best strategy for reaching a consensual truth, that strategy is ultimately corrupted by its subjection to financial mastery.   \n\n  \nMy question is, has any formal effort been made to institute academic independence along the lines of judicial independence?   \n  ",

As you can imagine its been a pretty rough two years and my academic growth hasn't been great.

I'm pretty burnt out right now and overall the idea of doing a professor's job (should I be that lucky) for the rest of my life fills me with dread. I like working and helping people, I enjoy science but I do not want to stay in academia. I'm good with collaborations and I get the job done. I've been looking at positions in biotech companies but I don't know if that's for me. Also they want a few years of experience. So my question is: what non traditional jobs have you taken up or know are available for a freshly minted PhD grad from the life sciences. Any advice would be much appreciated.

I applied for that specific company through my resume as listed on indeed.com, which is abnormal for my field.\n\nThe resume I had on indeed.com was adapted from my CV--at the top of my CV, I listed my research experience, and when adapting that to a resume on indeed.com, I simply put that my main job title was \"Researcher in &lt;specific engineering specialty that I went to school for&gt;\" for three years. The company's job description which I applied for stated that a minimum of 3-4 years' work experience was required.\n\nThe problem is, I put that I was a researcher at my school for 3 years (the length of my MS program) at the top of my resume, *indicating that I was a paid researcher employed by my school*. Except for 1 summer where I was directly employed by the school's research foundation to work on another PhD student's project, this is false; the only research I did during the school year was for my own thesis. I put \"researcher\" on my indeed.com resume because my main CV explains my research in detail at the top and lists the dates as the three years I attended school for, and I was blindly attempting to translate my CV into a resume.\n\nHowever, I may still count as a paid researcher in the sense that I attended my school's master's program for 3 years (which is what I really meant), and was a fully funded student (meaning, in a sense, I was indirectly paid to do my research, even though I \"earned\" the money through being a professor's grading assistant and supervising a computer lab). Furthermore, due to my research (which is not directly related to the job but still close enough), I do actually have the general technical skills that I claimed to have during the interview (and which they asked about). My job is also aware that I was a student during this time. For reference, this would be my first full-time job.\n\nSo finally, my question - when HR does a background check on me, will they try to see if I was actually a paid researcher **for** university projects (as opposed to a funded master's student who was performing their own research), or am I just being paranoid? If I did accidentally lie, should I contact them as soon as possible or hold my chin up and try to do the job as well as I can? As soon as I received the offer letter, saw a higher salary than I expected, and was reminded that there was a background check, I felt uneasy and decided to double-check my indeed.com profile. And obviously, I don't want to be unethical about this, even though if uncaught, I believe I would be able to do my job successfully.\n\ntl;dr I put that I was an \"Engineering Researcher\" at my school at the top of my resume under \"Work Experience\" when I was just a funded master's student (which I also listed under \"Education\"). The company who just hired me told me they would do a background check, and they know that I've just graduated from the master's program. Will my choice of words impact my new job when HR checks my employment background, or are they already fully aware of the situation and okay with this?\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nEDIT: Looks like I'm okay. I'll try to edit this post when my job starts to confirm.",

He went on and on about how I should make jewelry or paint something nice for a field he developed, and how he wants me to do a “Painting night” with girls to expose them to STEM. He wanted me to do fashion stuff and design clothes as well. He even suggested that I go to local high schools and host events exposing them to his research. His justification was that he wants to make the thing he developed universal and  make sure that everyone knows it. He also wanted me to start a club at my local university.\n\n\nBUT when I was trying to gear our conversation towards research, he was very dismissive of the idea.

        "text": "###I begin by defining terms. \n\n1. 'subject' signifies academic disciplines offered at a university. For this post, I'll use math as an example.\n\n2. 'interest' signifies so much true fervent attraction to a subject that you're \"thinking, living and breathing\" the subject, even in your spare time (e.g. when you're grocery-shopping or exerciising). Furthermore,  you love it so much that you'd teach yourself and read about it in your spare time.\n\n3. Being British, I'll use the [British undergraduate degree classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_undergraduate_degree_classification). 'ace' signifies grades like a First Class Honours at Oxbridge, namely a [Double or Triple First](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_undergraduate_degree_classification#Variations_of_first-class_honours). \n\n ###Belief\n\n4. Let me know if anyone knows of other research, but this [2014 Duke University study](https://today.duke.edu/2014/04/interest) substantiates my belief that interest is a necessary condition to success in an academic subject:\n\n &gt;Maintaining an interest in the goals you pursue can improve your work and reduce burnout, according to research from Duke University.\n\n &gt;\"Our research shows that interest is important in the process of pursuing goals. It allows us to perform at high levels without wearing out,\" said Paul O'Keefe, who conducted the studies as a doctoral student in Duke University's Department of Psychology &amp; Neuroscience, along with associate professor Lisa Linnenbrink-Garcia. \"This suggests that interest matters more than we suspected.\"\n\n ###Questions\n\n5. Does anyone know of counterexamples? E.g., are there any Fields Medallists or Nobel or [Noble-equivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_prizes_known_as_the_Nobel_of_a_field) Laureates who loathe their subject? \n\n6. Can anybody try to change my belief?",

        "text": "Less than a year ago, I took a job with someone I considered an academic hero. His books inspired me in undergrad to pursue grad school, and all during my master's I constantly referenced them, his papers, and his academic \"family tree.\" I've worked with people who worked for him and want to be the caliber of scientists they've become. So after finishing my master's and doing a string of research internships while looking for PhD positions, when I heard he needed a researcher I jumped at the opportunity. I realize now that I was blinded by the idea of working for him, so I didn't talk to anyone who recently worked for him, only people that hadn't seen him in 10 years...but I  moved across the country anyone. \n\nHe's been the worst boss I've ever had. There is no mentorship or teamwork here. He told me when he hired me that we could eventually put a committee together for my PhD; he's made it clear over and over he's too old for that and isn't going to mentor anyone anymore. He just wants worker bees who don't ask questions. Yes, I've improved on research techniques while being here, but how can I really learn from someone who doesn't even let me contribute my own ideas during meetings? He can't communicate with women and there is an obvious difference in respect for me and the other woman who works here compared to the men. He won't read papers that don't cite him. He's told me he doesn't understand why I (an american woman) don't have a PhD program already because the universities are flooded with \"foreigners\" and Americans should be chosen first.  Oh I could go on and on....all the stereotypes of an old, grumpy, outdated white male scientist (dinosaur) were true. I've been miserable and was about to quit to work in a pizza place when I got another offer somewhere else. Today's my last day (of 7 months of very hard work) and he keeps getting my name wrong. \n\nSO-- I feel like I'm escaping, and I'm happy to leave and am excited about my new job, but I want to warn others about this situation. He lied to me and my coworkers also admit they were promised a lot of things with this job that they know they will never get. But he's a big name in our field and I know past mentees still think highly of him. Any advice??\n\nOH and here's the catch. He's only loosely associated with a university and he owns the research facility. So he is THE boss, I can't talk to a department head or other professors. \n",

The reason I am asking this maybe classic question is the feeling I had during my last year as I got into contact with the leading scholars of my field and seen the management aspects of academia. I was lucky to be funded to attend three research stays but at the same time I had the opportunity to observe/hear the ugly side of the science like what is done in regards to citations, joint publications of some people, how personal relations affect the decisions on project proposals, etc.\n\nThese all  encouraged me to forget about the stressful path in Academia and leave for industry. With the permission from my supervisor, I have applied for some industrial positions and soon enough I got an offer from a company in wind energy sector. Immediately, I started regretting my decision because I enjoy research so much. I know some will say but do you have experience to work in industry to say that it will not as enjoyable and yes I have (internships during bachelor and master). I have nothing against industry and to be honest I am flattered to get an offer so soon but this feeling should indicate something I guess. Then, because of my feeling, I contacted two professors at ETH and EPFL and I did an interview with people at EPFL and got an offer for a one year (extendable) PostDoc position. The interview process for PostDoc was enjoyable but the one for industry (that I got an offer for) was strangely stressful for me which again should indicate something. I know some may at this point say you are trying to justify your willing towards the academic position. But I am not; I just want to know what you see in this situation.\n\nI have a relatively good scientific profile with several (&gt;10) papers in tier 1 ISI engineering journals (IF: 1.5-6) and a really good network in academia but I know that there is nothing guaranteed for me regarding TT positions, the competition is brutal (which dictates accepting a bad work-life balance), the contracts are time-limited (and underpaid), I have to move again and again, and more importantly I have to deal with (or better said accept) the aforementioned nasty part of science. In contrast, in industry I don't feel the sense of freedom, the dynamic environment, and all my efforts in writing papers, proposals, supervising students, and teaching will become rather redundant. I know again some will say no it will not and some will say but exactly for these skills you got the job in industry but you know what I mean.\n\nI guess what I am asking here is how you see my situation and what is your recommendation in this case for making a good decision and I have to decide soon.",

My main concern (beside the costs), is the fact that the entry requirements are 60 credits in maths. I've studied computer science in Italy and even with my extra/choice 12 credits (assuming I'll do those in maths) I'll barely scracth 42 credits. Does anybody, with more experience than me, know what I should do, if I can do anything? Can't I apply because of this? Or do I need to do those extra 18 credits on my own? Honestly I don't know if I'll manage in so little time! \n\nThanks for the clarifications. :)",

To be honest I messed up big time while in college because of the freedom I had and all the distractions that came with it. But at the end I managed to graduate with a 2.7 gpa which was very disappointing. \n\nDuring my time in college I had a part time job working with the athletic trainers and by the time I graduated I decided I wanted to get into sports medicine. But with my gpa and lack of prerequisites getting into a PT program was non existent so I decided to call it quits.\n\nAfter graduating I worked a few odd jobs here and there and finally decided to become a certified personal trainer about a year ago to earn some extra income. Ever since then I’ve been really interested in getting back into school. \n\nA few months ago a friend advised me to go back to school for physical therapy assistant and then try to become licensed after earning my (two year) degree and then take it from there.\n\nLong story short I called to set up an appointment with an advisor of a PTA program I am interested in at a community college and was asked to bring my transcript. S**t!\n\nMy question is will my GPA hinder my chances or prevent me from getting into the program? \n\nPS I recently got a part time job working as a physical therapist aide about a month ago to help with the application process.

I have few experiences and each time, my subject was disappointed. For example, the subject of my thesis is “The cost of a pathology”, so I measure the total amount that a pathology costs. My last internship was about the consumption of psychotropics in Europe, so I measured the consumption of psychotropics pills in Europe… \n\nRight now, I want to be useful to society. I’m a pharmacist, with two master degrees (public health and Health Economics/Health Technologies Assessment) and the next year a Ph.D in Health Economics. \n\nPrevious work : \n\nIntership in epidemiology (4 mouth). This experience made me decide to do research.  It was cool, I analyzed the relationship between a drug and a pathology in a cohort. \n\n\nIntership in a state agency (6 mouth). It was a lot of data management, but the staff was great people. I measure the quality of a database about all inpatients in my country (so millions of lines).\n\n\n1 year in ministry of health : about the consumption of psychotropics in Europe. It was a strange experience. I had finished all the tests after 2 months, then my supervisor left. I stayed 1 month without any hierarchy, and then the new supervisor asked me to continue analyses that didn't make much sense for 6-7 months. The kind of analysis I did ? PCA (principal component analysis) with &lt; 10 events… I felt in depression, because I believed I was too stupid to understand why this was a good idea when my supervisor was so confident.  \n\n\nAnd actually my thesis (3 years) with a database with billions of lines and hundreds of row. Again, I have often fallen into depression. I see all my colleagues doing crazy stuff (modeling, machine learning, statistical testing) while all I am asked are averages and medians with no possibility to deviate. \n\n\nAt the end of my day, I don't think I have any concrete skills to bring to anyone. All my previous work was descriptive. My results are relevant only for few officials who can put it in the introduction in a report.  That's why I would like to be useful. Do a job where I know that contributes to making this world a better place (after all, I am first and foremost a medical professional). I am currently interested in the Universal Health Coverage.. But I don't know if I have the talent to work in the World Bank or the WHO. I’m little bit lost. How to become useful ? Any advice ? \n",

It seems crazy to follow a career path (a very demanding and competitive one at that) where the end goal is a life I don't actually want.  \n  \nI still want to do my research though, and all I need to do so is money. So I have been thinking more and more seriously about quitting academia and looking for part time work that pays well enough for me to spend half my time focused solely on the research I love.

Well, I know that the results obtained by my friend are not breakthrough of any sort. He reported absence of certain effect in observed data which is not as easily publishable as reporting presence of some effects. And it would be fine if reviewer cited absence of any novelty as a reason for rejection. But I feel like not citing certain articles which are under a large paywall for scientists in my country is just not a fair reason for rejection without a chance to revise.\n\nSo my question would be: should we engage in correspondence with the journal trying to clarify the issue or asking for a chance to revise or should we just forget about publishing this text? As my friend explained me, trying to publish this text in a different journal may result in copyright violation, as he has already submitted this text to another journal.
