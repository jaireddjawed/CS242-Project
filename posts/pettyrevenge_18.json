        "text": "My mom never stands up for herself, so when she shared this story with me I was so proud I almost popped.\n\nMy Mom's sister, who I'll call Angie, has decided to wrap her whole identity around being a grandmother, and as a result she's made every family get together, holiday, reunion, etc. revolve around her grandkids since the birth of her first one about 8 years ago. The addition of more grandkids has not quelled her mania, and the rest of the family is pretty tired of it.\n\nEvery year for Christmas Mom puts together a silly activity for the adults; she wraps money and other small prizes in layers in a ball made of cellophane or plastic wrap with different types of tape here and there. Everyone unwraps frantically and tries to get as many prizes as possible out before having to toss the ball to someone else. This year Angie decided her grandkids were old enough to join in the game, and told Mom how much fun they were going to have with the children joining in. Mom was a bit taken aback and told Angie she had always meant this to be an activity for the adults, the kids had plenty of other things to keep them entertained, and that if she really wanted a ball for the kids Angie could make her own. A fight ensued, ending with Mom giving in to Angie, as always. \n\nExcept it doesn't stop there. Before the big day, Mom decided to add a few more layers to the ball after a quick trip to an adult novelty store. When Angie's six year old granddaughter wound up with a penis shaped whistle in her lap, Angie hurriedly ushered all of her grandchildren out of the room, refusing to talk to Mom for the rest of the evening. Mom explained to everyone left in the room it's a game she makes for the adults, so she wasn't sure why Angie was surprised by the appearance of adult prizes.",

        "text": "This is on behalf of a guy named Gill I worked with about 28 years ago, and this is one of several humorous stories about himself that he shared.\n\nFirst, some background: I don't remember Gill's last name, and he's probably drank himself to death by now. He had two tours of duty in Vietnam and two teenage kids who occasionally spent time in jail - even at Christmas - for trying to emulate stupid things they saw in movies. Everything that came out of his mouth was deadpan, so it was impossible to tell when he was intentionally trying to be funny.\n\nGill was telling me about the regular person whose job was to empty everyone's trash at a previous job. Whenever this guy was about to be on vacation the next workday, he wouldn't empty the trash - opting instead for compressing the trash in each can. Gill would be the one to empty the trash while the regular person was on vacation, and since the trash was denser than it should be, it was a pain to empty it all.\n\nFinally, Gill got tired of it, so the whole week that the other guy was on vacation, Gill didn't empty any of the trash. He compressed it all each day. He would get on top of desks or other items and jump down into the trash cans instead for the amount of compression that would be necessary to make it last through the regular worker's vacation.\n\nI followed Gill's example in a more minor way when I later worked as a retail manager. A different department manager's method was to overfill a weak trash bag in a can with his department's old food and that my employees would be responsible for emptying. I finally just dragged that trash can, as he or his employees left it, to his department as it would be impossible to empty without creating a bigger mess. I never heard from him directly, but I heard he was hopping mad at me.\n\nOriginally posted in r/MaliciousCompliance.  I couldn't convince them that most of the story, about Gill, was (I feel) definitely malicious compliance, and that my small part at the end was too because either way, the trash can(s) got emptied.  :)  But this is a good place for this too.",

        "text": " This happened not long ago where my little half baked scheme against a crummy company worked flawlessly   \n\nHere in  the U.S. (or at least mine and surrounding states) to get a license for specific fields(I.e. cosmetology, general contracting, real estate appraising) you have to pass a standardized test. No biggie pretty normal stuff. The problem begins where there is only one testing service you’re allowed to use. They essentially have a monopoly on the licensing testing. \n\nI live within a tri-state area, and was going to get my third state license to complete the trifecta. That being said, I am very familiar with this testing service. The physical site themselves is very good and I enjoy the people who work there but the overall company, including customer service, scheduling, and overall management is complete garbage. \n\nNow for the story.  I cannot stand this testing service, the amount of hoops you have to jump through is completely unreasonable(even for a state regulated testing service). I could go on and on about the nightmares I went through with this company over the year it took to get my licenses. Anyways, So the other day I went back for my fifth time to take my test(I failed my first state the first time, and third state the first time). I live 10 minutes away from the testing site, and they say arrive 30 minutes early so I left 45 minutes before my testing time. It just so happened in the last mile before the site we had horrific stop and go traffic due to road work in an area usually with none. Now, traffic is normal in my area, but it took my commute from 10 minutes to well over an hour. I tried to inform the testing company but was sent to customer service. They demanded so much information, and I was trying to be decent(I’ve worked in similar over the phone jobs so I know how rude people can be) but ultimately took a while just for them to say they had no direct line and no way to contact them and I am going to lose my expensive testing fee. I couldn’t afford to take the test again, so the scheming began.   \n\nWhile siting in traffic, I took the testing centers confirmation email and copied, pasted, and resent it to myself with the only thing being changed is adding enough time for me to be there on time. It was a simple yet very effective scheme as it was nearly identical to what they sent. Upon arrival, they notified me I missed my testing time to which I said “Oh I thought my time was 2:30, I must be wrong” and proceeded to pull up the crafted email showing I was “right”. This caused them to be confused because there blocks were only in certain hour time intervals yet looked legit enough where they investigated. They saw that I was scheduled for 2 o’clock but the test I was taking was quiet short and ultimately without any more fight besides that email, let me take the test. \n\nI was beyond happy to be sitting for the test and I also passed! That little scheme against that monopolistic garbage fest of a company plus finishing the trifecta made that a great day. Goodbye testing center!",

They offered to pay but we said no and then didn't hear anything for a few months. Then in early Fall they asked again and offered to pay again. I said no again. Then they came back with \"you don't complain about our fence and we won't complain about your shed being too close to the others neighbors fence\". So I said give me the weekend to think about it.\n\nI then spent the weekend moving my shed exactly 10 inches farther away from the fence so it complied with city bylaws and we haven't talked since. Not about the fence, not about anything. It's been 4 months. \n\nSuper petty but I am quite proud of this.",

This lady has her daughter all looking good and tells me she is getting her photo for a beauty pageant and when I am done with that she wants another package of family portraits.  So as I'm doing the shoot and posing and actually getting great photos. The mom jumps in and tells me the poses are bad  (they weren't) and wanted me to pose the daughter her (mom) way.  This is taking way to long, people in line are getting edgy, kids in line are starting to cry. All this makes my job tougher.  I finally get the daughters package done and the father finally shows up... He was still eating a piece of pizza.  Anyway I get the three posed and the mom again wants me to pose them a certain way.  The bitch really got on my nerves.  I told her we have set poses for different size groups and I am going to pose them accordingly.  Usually you move the people to the different spot so each picture is different. This gives the family more choices.  Well I put the mom where I could crop in the photo and cut her out of the picture.  I ended up cropping her head off, cropping half her body off. Just basically keeping her out of the picture.  I didn't sell any of the family portraits but sold the daughters portraits.  I also quit the job after I got home. Too many headaches, kids with snotty noses getting me sick, pooping kids. The worse were the parents.",

Then he calls me and wants me to give him and some of our other friends, that ”grew tired” of Ed’s behaviour, a ride. I do that and while driving my friend gets another message that’s a screenshot from a conversation with Ed that says ”tell *my freind* that he’s just a dumb midget and that i’m smarter than him and have more money than him even though i dropped out of school. And if he wants to mess with me, I have dudes that will back me up and kick his ass.” \n\nNow this is kinda funny cuz my friend invests a lot of his money in stocks so most of his money is there and Ed’s bank account doesn’t compare to that. Ed aslo got the staple as the worst worker in our company’s history and he definetly isn’t that smart. \n\nWhen my friend arrives at the club, he tells a secrutiy guard what Ed has said and that Ed threatened him. They show the security guard his picture and they decide that he won’t be able to enter the club. \n\nHe arrives a little later and is told at the door that he isn’t welcome and that he won’t be allowed in. Everyone else in his company got in and Ed texts one of the guys in my friends company that he didn’t get in and that he’s crying outside. If you want to be an a-hole like that then you have to accept the consequenses. \n\nHe still won’t get a hint and continues to talk shit about my friend, telling people that he’s a pedo and it seems that he can’t keep my friends name out of his mout. The reason for this is because my friend has his way with the ladies which Ed doesn’t. So he’s jealous of him and tries to go for all of the girls that my friend has been with.",

        "text": "Back when I was in 7th grade this kid was one of those annoying people that mess with people in an attempt to be funny but it just annoys the shit out of everybody.\n\nEverything he did was just stupid, it ranged from crumbling up somebodies test, or flipping somebodies backpack inside out with all the stuff in it, or throwing away somebodies trapper keeper with the rings unhinged. (Yes, somehow trapper keepers made a weird comeback in 2017, I myself had one) \n\nBut one day he decides to taser me in the side relentlessly throughout class and then when we get ready to take a quiz he crumbles it up and throws it on the floor. From that day forward I decided to get my revenge.\n\nMy school was relatively small compared to other neighboring counties schools and we had a good amount of people in them so they would call us in waves depending on how we would get home so everyone and their mother wouldn’t be in the hallways toppling over people. Right before my wave for bus riders was called to go home I decide to strike. \n\nI took his trapper keeper and tied it to his table when he wasn’t looking and messing with someone else and no telling how many times I knotted that thing, it was impossible to get it undone. As soon as I got done knotting it my wave was called and I darted out of that room without being seen. \n\nThe next day I walk in math class the straps were still there and he ended up cutting them off cuz he couldn’t get it undone in time I suppose. But he was pretty posted about that. But that’s my petty revenge story :)",

        "text": " So in the late 90s I was working a well paying job as a saw man for a logging company. It was the end of the month and on top of my usual pay, I got a bonus for safety and productivity.  My boss payed cash on payday, so even though the banks where closed by quitting time I was flush  \n It was the day before my anniversary sooo I decided to stop in at a local jewelry store I had browsed once or twice before. Now mind you I'm in my mid to late 20s, long hair, dark tanned, dirty clothes, work boots the whole shebang.\n I am browsing slowly and the younger of two sales women asks if I wanted any help. Before I could say a single word, the older of the two says. \"Don't bother, Those people Never buy anything.\" I'm not sure if she was implying I was Hispanic, blue collar or both.  But that flew all over me. \n So I simply said to her, \"Well I'm sorry you feel that way but my money is as green as the next guys. Not that it's any if your buisness but I walked in her with $860 cash looking to buy my wife an anniversary gift.\" Mind you at this time $200 a week was considered a well paying job in our area.\n Immediately her tune changed but I said no thank you I'll go somewhere else.  The younger lady who had been willing to help me recommend I go across town to another jewelry store. Which I did. They where helpful, genuine and open any case and allowed me to see any piece I wanted to up close. I spent north of $500 that day.\n I made it a point to go back to the first jewelry store and think the young lady,  gave her a tip. And made sure that the other saleswoman heard how much I spent at the competition.  \n We stayed with the second jewlery store until they closed.  Almost two decades later my wife and I where looking for a bracelet for her. The original store had moved twice, changed owners 5 times but that woman still worked there. And she still remembered me and even though they where the only jewelry store in town I didn't buy anything from them.\n We stopped at a place in the next town, where treated like real people and wound up spending a whole lot more than $500 this time around. And yes I made sure that before we left the first store to tell my wife I'll buy you your wishlist jewelry somewhere else. Where they will appreciate our budget and we left. We did go back with the new jewelry to browse and \"show off\" that we had the money we says we had.\n Never assume you know how much someone can afford. You don't,  always treat them like they are a person and have no expectations.  You will be suprised.  Most people with money don't show it",

        "text": "I have a love/hate relationship with my best friend’s (M) fiancé (F). I wont get into all the specifics but to sum it up she is rude, disrespectful, demanding, and lazy. She can sometimes be nice, but typically her behavior towards me is ill-mannered. I deal with her because I love my friend. \n\nI have a great house/backyard for entertaining and their house is far too cluttered for such, so I allowed them to have their engagement party at my place last year with 50+ guests. While at the engagement party at my house, two of her friends came onto me (I’m gay but nobody can ever tell) and the one in particular (let’s call her Carol) wouldn’t give it up. I have never in my life faced any sort of harassment but this one changed that. After telling her I prefer men, she kept coming onto me demanding I allow her to use “several” of her strap-ons on me and how bad she wanted to “fuck” me. She (literally) had me up against a wall, was breathing in my face like a rabies-infested creature… I realized she wasn’t going to fuck off so I finally pushed her aside and said to screw off and stop the shit or leave my home. It was five minutes of her in my face telling me all the things she’ll do to me in graphic detail. It was truly strange and disturbing. \n\nFast forward to a few months later (last week) my buddy and his fiancé invite me over to their house for dinner and board games. Great! I love board games and food. I arrive and we smoked a joint, got relaxed… it was a beautiful snowy evening! Fiancé (in a nonchalant tone) says to my buddy “oh, Carol will be here any minute.” I said “wait WHAT? You invited HER over here after I literally told you I don’t ever want to be around her again??” And fiancé says “well yeah, obviously I wasn’t going to tell you she was coming otherwise you wouldn’t have come over tonight.” Game on bitch! If you’re going to pull that shit behind my back when you knew how uncomfortable she made me at the party, and hide that she was coming to dinner too, then you get what you deserve. It was super disrespectful and inconsiderate to purposely hide that and put us together in the same room again. I immediately knew what I was going to do and put a smile on. I’ll also add that there has been about 10 instances after the engagement party where fiancé has DESPERATELY tried to get me to go out on a date with Carol and let her fuck me with her strap ons, even after I have told her I have zero interest. Mind boggling this gal…. \n\nBefore the catan game night where she invited Carol, I agreed to letting her have her college graduation party (once again) at my house, another rager with 60+ people. She was sooooo looking forward to using my house to have her party here and let me deal with all the prep, cleanup, you name it. They’re too lazy to clean their house and get rid of all their shit so they use my place for parties, apparently. \n\nWell the night of the game night she confirmed with me that it was still OK to have her graduation party at my house. Knowing my plan, I agreeably said “of course, will be so much fun!” And the night carried on. \n\nShe sent out the grad party invite via Facebook with my address as the location. Once that was sent, I sent her a text a couple days later telling her that I have decided she will no longer be hosting her party at my house and she will need to find someplace else. While I didn’t tell her the reason for canceling the party, it brings a smile to my face knowing I ruined her plans and she’ll now have to have her graduation party likely at the community park rather than my beautiful, party-friendly home.",

        "text": "There’s plenty of similar stories in this sub but I wanted to share my own little taste of revenge! Obligatory ‘I’m on mobile’ note.\n\nThe Setup:\n\nI work in escape rooms. It’s not a difficult job by any means, I spend most of my time sitting in an office and giving occasional clues to teams, but the hours I work can be a bit all over the place. They’re often dependent on bookings, and I only get the rota a few days in advance, so making plans can be tricky.\n\nBut I have one day where the evening is empty, and I make plans for dinner with my lovely partner. Amazing! I clock out, get my jacket on, and the phone goes.\n“Fuck it,” I think, “It’ll only take a moment.” And I answer the phone.\n\nThere’s a male voice on the other end, and laughter in the background. I can guess they’re out, maybe in a pub somewhere, and he asks about booking an escape room for a bachelor party. Okay, that only takes a few minutes to sort. I ask for his name, email, how many people it’ll be for, when it should be booked.\n\nI pretty quickly realise this is probably a prank call. There’s a group of men laughing after everything he says, he keeps asking me to repeat questions, and he starts making increasingly ridiculous requests (“can we redecorate the room?” “Can I bring my Guinea pig?” “Can we bring extra people for free?”)\n\nI don’t want to give him the satisfaction of a reaction, so I just hang up.\n\nI send out a message on the work group chat explaining what happened and noting the number, and I get a message from someone working at the other site in town: “I was just about to send a message, they prank called us 20 minutes ago. Got all the way to payment and then they hung up.”\n\nI check my bus times and wouldn’t you know it, I’ve missed my bus. Next one isn’t for an hour. Thanks to this asshole I’ve got an extra unpaid hour to sit in this little office, and I’m going to be late for dinner with my partner.\n\nThe Revenge:\n\nSo I’m sitting, and seething, thinking about how my evening plans have been spoiled by this dick who was going to face absolutely no repercussions.\n\nThen an idea formed, and I asked my colleague “John” about what happened, and the details he was given. Turns out with my prank call they had worked out a script, but with their first call he was caught off guard. So I was given a fake name and email, but John was given a name and email that sounded much more realistic.\n\nAnd we had his mobile number.\n\nNow it might not surprise you to know that you can find a LOT of information about someone with their name, email and mobile number.\n\n(BTW Markus if you ever see this, 41 is far to old to be doing shit like prank calls)\n\nIt is also the minimum info needed to sign up to a lot of different services. And I had an hour to kill.\n\nI’ll never know his reaction, but I hope the messages from Scientology, Jehovah’s Witnesses (did you know you can schedule calls from them? I hope Markus works night shifts, otherwise those late calls are going to be so annoying), jazzercise, Zumba, real estate agents, gym membership and readers digest don’t clog up his phone too much.\n\nI would hate for his time to be wasted.",

All things considered she does actually have a good life. I listened and listened and tried to help, but she would still continue the same patterns and expect a different result. Realised with her it wasn't about improving,  it was about being centre of attention. Many hours conversation of the same ole and it being a one sided conversation of her issues and mine being fobbed off, even serious stuff I I went through would recieve radio silence. I do get periods of needing space away from everyone and everything and ignore everyone. My sanity is important. During one of my down moments she had the front to cry and try to make me feel guilty for not being there for her. Cue petty revenge. If my best wasnt good enough for you, and you think I'm not there for you, then I may as well do what you think I am doing and not be there. No longer respond and avoid!",

        "text": "This happened about 25 years ago. Our office moved to a new location in an industrial park in the city. Across the road was a food service company and they started work very early in the morning. Our company is a large logistics delivery company. We had very limited employee parking along the perimeter of the property. For several weeks we had random cars in the parking lot every morning. It is important to note that the food company had lots of land but very limited parking, the rest of their property was an overgrown field.  I would go over and speak to the manager and request that they remind their employees that they could not park on private property. Simple friendly and neighborly request. \n\nFast forward a few weeks and this specific car keeps showing up randomly in our lot. We are not a huge office and know it is not anyone at our office. I make the trek over to the food company across the road and asked them to remind their employee not to park in our lot due to our limited space. The food company office manager started getting irritated,copped an attitude and told me that their employees would do no such thing and they have all been told not to park in our lot. \n\nI am quite pissed at their attitude and I am a petty bastard. We had two spare delivery vans that day so I took the keys and parked one on each side of the car only a couple of inches from the vehicle. Took the keys with me and waited. I am out of the office for a bit and lo and behold we get a call from the food company. They had to work to call in as our office number is unlisted and they have to go through a 1-800 number and work to get routed to the correct office phone. They are calling because, Surprise! Apparently an employee wants to go home but cannot get into his car. Cue me coming back to the office and before moving the vehicles I walked over to the food company and asked them if there was a problem. The office manager sheepishly asked me to move the vans blocking their employees car to which I respond \"you mean the car that does not belong to anyone at your office?\" I then kindly reminded her hat they need to speak to their staff about the parking situation. I moved the vans and watched a guy head out to his car refusing to look in my direction and head home for the night.  \n\nLess than a week later the field next to the Food company was graded and a new gravel parking lot was made. Never saw them park a car on our lot since",

And she’s not the loud type she’s the whisper softly and make you feel guilty for no reason type. Why I say this is because my family and I are from southern Alabama. My mother and father have a very thick accent. They grew up with nothing and with almost no education they some how beat the odds and created a very successful crane business. When I was younger we moved up north. I lost most of my accent but there’s has only changed mildly. They went from nothing to three vacation homes and getting whatever they want. As they should because they worked harder than I ever would. They have worked Beyond the expectation of a normal person. So on to the pettiness. My ex mother in law always thought of me and my family as low class. Even though she’s only successful because she cheated on her husband with a general and has life easy now. Never worked anything but her 😺. She has went as far to tell my ex husband that if our children are around my family too much they might pick up on our accent and sound stupid or uneducated. That In the long run we’re hurting her only grandchildren and his bloodline. \n   So today I told my ex husband were doing Alaska themed pictures and I’m paying for everything he just needs to be there in the pictures for memories for our kids.. I gave both of his sons a mullet and his daughter pug tails. Everyone has overalls on and I went as far as bringing my friends golden retriever. I even went vintage shopping and got a few old moonshine bottles for them to pretend they’re drinking. Is it dumb? Yes.. but my ex loves mountains and he has no clue what hillbilly looks like and will be so excited to show this to his entire family. \n   I just wish I could see the expression on her face when she’s reminded where they came from. Like I’m never fully leaving Karen.",

The kind of place people went specifically to flaunt their wealth. \n\nOne day this man came into the bar. He had already checked out and the valet had his McLaren parked outside. He had been around before, we knew him to be a problem and someone to watch out for. We didn’t let women serve him (he was a creep) but had no men to do it this day. I didn’t know how expensive that car was before this happened. He had the key fob on him.  \n\nHe ended up sexually harassing my coworkers verbally and did full undercarriage scoops to them when he could (you know the grab creeps do when they go so low their fingers are on your vulva.). When I asked him to refrain from touching, he flipped out on all of us. \n\nThe guy started cussing us out, calling us poor and stupid in vulgar ways, threw his drink at my face, told us he paid for us so he can touch us, and then began smoking inside and flicking cigarettes at us and putting them out on the art. Security wasn’t much help and the GM didn’t want to kick him out. He refused to leave on his own. During his tantrum, he dropped his key fob. \n\nI took the fob. Once he tried to leave and realized it wasn’t on him, he flipped out more. We checked cameras, everything, nobody could see where the fob went. I threw it away in another location after my shift. \n\nHe went outside to angrily pull at the car and the alarm went off.  He had to stay at a regular hotel down the block. The alarm stayed on until the next morning when it was towed. By the morning the alarm had annoyed people in this bar neighborhood they had trash thrown on it. He was riddled with embarrassment. He never came back :)",

        "text": "I posted this originally in regularrevenge and it was voted as petty, so I’m posting here too since it’s one of my favourite stories. \n\nI read this subreddit regularly and was reminded of a story that fits. I didn’t do the  petty revenge myself but it was in response to something that happened to me. \n\nThis was years when I played in a band with some friends. I had a small car I used to bring some gear to and from shows. We usually played clubs that would have multiple bands on.\n\nOne night, some guy (also playing the show) hit my car in the lot and broke my taillight with his bumper. All would have been well and good but him and his bandmates denied it happened, loaded their stuff out, and then one of them left with the car. I went inside to ask about cctv and it didn’t get it. Fun. \n\nI went back to my friends, they asked what was wrong and I relayed what happened. One of them, we’ll call Danny (our guitar player who’s also really, really impulsive) asks who it was, I look around and point out the guy who hit me, he was doing sound check (they were on first). We continued chatting between ourselves when Danny suddenly walks off towards the stage. He went to the side where the guy set up his guitar amplifier, twisted a lot of the knobs on the front of the amp really fast and then speed walked back over to us. The rest of us collectively gave him a look of “what was that?” And paraphrasing he responded with “those are terrible to dial in”\n\n*Basically, on a guitar amp you have knobs that affect the sound. You have volume and gain (the amount of distortion, think Beatles vs. Megadeth), and also knobs that adjust the volume of different frequencies (e.g. bass, middle, and treble for low, medium and high frequencies). There are a lots of others too but that’s the basics. “Dialing-in” is setting the knobs to sound how you want. Not sure how much I needed to explain but that’s the gist to how I understand it as a non guitar player*\n\nSo I’m thinking to myself just how hard could it be, you just put the knobs back into about the same place? Well as it turns out some amplifiers are much harder to “dial in” than others, and this one, as Danny stated is apparently really hard. The time comes for them start soon and the guy who hit my car walks up and plays something. He looks around a bit and then starts to quickly adjust the knobs. I thought he got it back to something “passable” but hoolllly, when they started playing he did not sit well in his band’s mix. His sound formed a blanket that turned the whole band’s sound to mud, you couldn’t pick up any individual instrument whatsoever. It was like pea soup in sound form. I’ve been to children talent shows that sounded better.\n\nThey weren’t back the next time. The guys all chipped in to pay for my tail light (I paid nothing out of pocket in the end, love them), and I bought Danny his beer afterwards!",

He begged me to stay and said that he was gonna come over after he finished and we could have a romantic dinner - that I would have to make - and he would stay over. Me being young and head over heels for him said ok and talk to my friends and canceled. Well he called me later to say his friends invited him for drinks and he felt guilty to say no so he was gonna be a bit late - yeah he didn’t invite me - so again me being young and dumb was annoyed but said ok. Well time went by and he kept calling making up excuses until I was done and just went to sleep. He arrived at my house at almost 4am drunk. He said he was sorry, that he missed me and that he was hungry. At that point I had enough, so I went into the kitchen with the intention of giving him the steak raw and kicking him out until I saw my pup and remembered how he was always saying there’s nothing more disgusting than dog’s drool. So I made my pup very happy and gave him a taste before I served him his lovely dinner. That was years ago and we are still friends but till this date I still feel warm and fuzzy inside every time we go out to eat.",

Basically just so she can get full custody of our daughter.\n\nSo in order for me to fight this ppo  I had 14 days to file a petition. This was during covid lockdown so all motions and petition had to be Done via online. Okay fine but when I tried filing it myself it wouldn't work. I even called to ask them and they just told me to follow the directions online. I did and still couldn't get it too work.\n\nSo after numerous attempts I get  frustrated and decided to just mail them the paper work. I had it all filled out, signed and dated. Few days roll by and I get a call from the clerk office to tell me she had gotten my mail but was unable to file the motion for me. She said \"unfortunately, due to covid protocols we can't accept mail.\"\n\nI said \"ok you can't accept mail but didn't you just opened mine up since you know exactly what it is I sent you?\" \"yes but unfortunately due to covid protocols I still cant file this in for you. But if you wan-\" *click* I hang up the phone out of frustration. \n\nI was mystified and perplex how stupid and assinine this was. I eventually gave up and had the ppo take effect. Out of desperation i contacted my ex to plead with her too no avail. This ended up giving me a violation since she took a screen shot of it and send it to the courts. Which I was also surprised by the fact that she could send screen shots so effortlessly. While when I tried to file a motion and my screen shots to defend myself, It kept being rejected.\n\n  I ended up having a court date via zoom for ppo violation. In court the judge told me that there was nothin I can do about the ppo  since I didnt file a petition properly with in 14 days. So by me contactin my ex it was a violation. Judge gave me a warning and gave me some fines and fees I had to pay. Told me If I violate again I would be going to jail. Fine whatever I was so over it at this point..\n\nSo a few Days later I get a letter in the mail from them. I open it and it's my bill for the court fees. I Decided to give them a call. \"Yea so I was wondering do you guys accept checks in the mail to pay off my court fees?\" \"Absolutely.\" (Wow shocker) So I said \" huh ok, but that's weird how before when I sent you guys my mail for you too file my petition you told me you can't file it cause due to COVID you can't accept mail. But now you are sending me mail and asking me to pay court fees and that I send a check back to you, THROUGH MAIL?!\" \"Yes we are allowed to accept checks through mail.\" (How convenient) So I said, \" Huh thats interesting.. Well just so you guys are aware but I AM ALSO NOT  accepting mail due to covid so you will just have to email me the paper work for the court fines and fees. Good bye.\"\n\nI then put the paper work back in the enveloped, tapped it shut. Wrote on there in big bold letters \"won't accept mail due to covid. Please return to sender.\" \n\nIt was at that moment I had felt like I had gotten my little petty revenge on them. It's not that I taught them a big lesson but the fact that I got my point acrossed!

She's the type of person to spread rumours and say \"i heard someone said this about you, im only looking out for you\" meanwhile she is the snake. Everyone at work has been getting into arguments with eachother because of her rumours.\n\n\n\n\nThere was a rumour going around that I've been sleeping with 3 other people from work, including a client. I just know it was Megcunt whos been spreading these lies. My boss thankfully didn't believe the rumours, however my boyfriend did and he was having a tough time dealing with the shame he was recieving. \n\n\n\nA new girl started working with us, lets call her Sam. She's been best friends with Megan since highschool so of course I steered clear. Megcunt had been trying to get Sam and my boyfriend to become closer, she would always invite the two of them to parties and late night drinks (obviously I wasnt invited). Soon enough I found out my boyfriend hooked up with Sam. I ended the relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy boss invited the whole company out to a Christmas eve party and all employees could bring their partners. Megcunt brought her boyfriend. Now, I actually know her boyfriend from my old job, so I was talking to him for most of the night to purposefully make Megan uncomfortable. We ended up following eachother on instagram.\n\n\n\n\nWe started messaging on insta for the next couple of days. I asked him out for a drink, he happily accepted. When we met up he admitted that he didnt tell Megcunt about us meeting up. We soon got drunk and started dancing. We went from holding hands to holding eachothers waists where he admitted that he always found me hot, we then bagan feeling eachother up. I started kissing his neck and he pulled me closer. We starting making out, I invited him back to my place and before we knew it we were having sex. It didnt last that long but I didnt care. I got what i wanted. Ever since then we've been secretly hooking up every few days, Megan has no clue, and I dont give a shit. And even if people did find out, ill just play it off as another rumour.",

If your score is 94% or higher the meeting is optional and I’m commissioned based.\n\nI have been working at the company for years and have never had a score lower the 93.96% were my meeting got waved due the the fact my manager saw it was less then a quarter of a point, and I had a rough month personally. \n\nIn December I got a score of a 82% so my manager asked what happened and a saw 3 mistakes on the QM reps part that I followed protocol the rep was new and wasn’t aware and knocked me points. Cue petty revenge. It was slow as shit the week of Christmas. So I went to that meeting with my manager, the avp and the qm rep who all have better things to do. But I don’t. This meeting was supposed to an hour. I made sure to replay  the calls serval times. To pull up the memos, emails, and scripts showing the correct thing to do and showing on the screen recording where I did click the button but the system didn’t register. \n\nWell 3 hours later the meeting was completed i got a ton of time off the phone, wasted time of my manger, avp, and qm rep and got my score back to a 96% \n\nStay petty.",

        "text": "This happened almost 20 years ago. \n\nThis guy was an IRL troll in high school, before the word was even invented. We took a current events class together, and he would bully me in front of the class because he knew I was queer before I did. Every single day, taking it to the point that the teacher would have to step in, like “Oh, do you think that way because you’re gay? I think you have a bias, because you’re one of them” —but all in the name of “civil debate,” and I was still so sheltered I didn’t even know, so I couldn’t fight back, and nobody would do anything. This was also before people were cool about LGBTQ stuff, before GSAs were a thing, before most teachers would shut it down.\n\nHe was a sophomore and I was a senior, and it ruined my year. I got a D in the class because I skipped as much as possible, tanked my GPA right during college app time. I had a whole dream about going to a top school, and I ended up considering suicide over the grade. It was deep, it actually altered the course of my life significantly. \n\nFlash forward, I’m home for the holidays, just turned 21, buying alcohol at the local liquor store, which is a heavily regulated kinda place because we lived in a very conservative state that would ban alcohol if it could. Who should be in there buying alcohol, but That Guy. He even greeted me all stoked, like “Wow, how’ve you been?! Great to see you, happy new year…” I was super nice right back, introduced him to my SO, confirming I’m queer. He was even nice about that.\n\nI get up to the line and ask for the manager. I tell him I know for a fact that guy’s not 21 and if his ID says he is, it’s a fake. I write down his real name and our high school so they can look it up. \n\nThen I buy my liquor legally, go to the supermarket next door for some snacks. We leave twenty minutes later and there’s a cop car blazing lights, Troll Boy is outside in handcuffs. I found out later he had a warrant out for something else, I forget the actual crime, but I do remember it was a felony. Guess his life changed pretty deeply after that, too. Hope he never dropped the soap.",

        "text": "Many years ago my wife and I bought an old Ford Telstar for $1000 as a temporary second car until I got a new job and work vehicle. We gave it (free) to her sister but it stayed registered in my name. The deal was she had to pay for rego and dealt with any potential fines. \n\nFast forward a few years and I had separated from the wife for some time and was going through a somewhat messy divorce. By coincidence, I was living in the same street as the SIL. I was seeing a lovely girl and she would stay over at my place occasionally. \n\nOne day the new GF and I were in the street walking back from the local shops when the SIL drives over to the wrong side of the road, winds down the window and hurls abuse. Something about the divorce and how I was being an arsehole. I told her to fuck off at which point she grabbed my arm and pulled me hard against the car. My hand ended up next to the ignition. So I turned it off, yanked the keys and tossed them into the passenger footwell, thinking that would distract her and give the GF and I time to get to my front door.\n\nInstead, the SIL jumped out of the car and tried to punch me but missed and thumped my GF in the face. Meanwhile, her car (with her 3yo daughter inside) rolled away and hit another parked car. Called the cops, protection (restraining) order and so on. \n\nAt some point, soon after that, I remembered her car was still registered in my name. Partly for revenge and partly because I was worried about getting her speeding fines etc, I filled out a disposal notice stating that the car had been transferred to the SIL. This effectively removed me from the rego. \n\nShe was angry when she got a notice to rego the car. The catch was she hadn't looked after it and it would never pass a safety check. She realised it wasn't worth keeping and in her own form of revenge dumped it out the front of my house. Full of rubbish, used nappies, half-eaten McDonalds and more Coke bottles than I could count. She put the keys in my mailbox.\n\nMore revenge ensued. The dumb woman contravened the court order by coming within a certain distance of my house. The cops must have been bored as they knocked on her door and gave her a verbal warning. She couldn't deny the violation as her car was parked right in front of my house. Afterwards, I parked the car on the median strip outside her house so she couldn't use the driveway and tossed the key on her roof. It racked up some fines and then got towed. \n\nTL;DR - Ex-SIL assaulted my GF. Forgot her car was registered to me. Left her with no car.",

I was hired as a regular employee and given the manager position after he found out my mom used to be a few years prior to my working there and I knew the ins and outs of the store.  I was the manager for 2 years and my boss hired a guy 2x my age who did not like having a young female boss. He was trying to tell people he was the manager, that he was gonna take my job and hire whomever he pleased. I reported it to the owner. Owner didnt do much.\n\n Well a few months in we got into a fight (employee and I) and he threatened me with violence and My boss took the guys side! The employee threatened to beat my ass...And I told my boss, I wanted to fire him and hire someone else. He spoke with the employee and I got \"bro coded\". Basically He took the employees side of it all because bro code, and dismissed the fact that he had threatened me and let me go. Needless to say I was FURIOUS. 2 years id worked my ass off for this man from 4:30am til 10pm or later, most days alone, mostly 6 days a week. Id been sexually harassed, assaulted, robbed and I STILL STAYED. But this dude comes along and you take his word over mine? Nah, homie. I got you.\n\nMy boss forgot all of his utilities, deliveries and basically EVERYTHING was in My name because he barely spoke english and the companies always dealt with me anyway. He had so much trouble communicating in english it was just easier to have me do it and I knew all of the Vendors anyway cuz of my moms job there years prior, nothing had changed except we added a few new things to bring in business (That I advertised and did all the work for mind you.)\n\nI canceled EVERYTHING. I called every single Vendor, All his utilities and deliveries were stopped in their tracks. The \"Employee\" He so loved and respected and such, Yeah that idiot got arrested a month after I was fired. For what? Assaulting his girlfriend. Soooo....He lost everything and had to sell the business within 2 months. I feel absolutely ZERO remorse for it because he put a grown ass mans hurt feelings over my physical safety and I was not having that shit. If I had to go back, would I do things differently? Maybe. But Do I feel remorse? Nope. I built that company for him the best I could as a 20 something year old girl. I took all of my loyal customers with me and about 75% of them still over 10 years later still wont go there because of what happened. They still come to wherever im working at.",

So when I was 17 I went to a friends house and had a nice night in and watched movies. That’s what I told my sister. Lol actually I had drank with my friends. And my sister knew I had lied. Not because we were in a small town and things are quick. No it’s because I looked hung over and didn’t think I did. \n\nSo what does my sister do, she takes me for a hike. We hiked in this canyon area near us. The drive was interesting, I stuck my hand out of the window and I remember feeling very at ease. Feeling the wind was calming. Well my sister this whole time asked about my night and how I was feeling. I’d give her small answers like oh we did this. And ehh just tired. \n\nWe get to the canyon, half way through the hike. She looks at me, “Be dead honest, no repercussions did you drink last night and what?” I looked at her and said “yeah I did, I killed a bottle of vodka.” (It wasn’t very big tbh) Both her and my BIL laughed and said “we knew it!” Shortly after we turned around. Went driving. \n\n Here’s the revenge. \nI took a nap in the back. And I was out for about an hour. Then I woke up to my sister and bil screaming! And my sister, who is driving, slamming the brakes. I jumped up scared out of my mind. Clarity hits we’re fine lol. That point on I tried to be very upfront with my sister about what I’m doing.",

He is a narcissist and I only started seeing the emotional abuse clearly as I got out of the relationship and started therapy.\n\nWell, it turns out his mother has a problem too. I started unfriending all his family on FB. After two years of not talking to any of them, I didn't see the point in having them around. The latest has been his siblings. There are other reasons I still have his mother as a friend but I don't want to go into them as it's a little too much detail. I don't need my ex or his mother coming at me for this. Once that stuff is over, I'll just remove her as a friend but for now, I need to be petty.\n\nHis mother is freaking. If I remove her, she won't see the photos I share of the kids. She wants to see what the kids do at both houses. Well, so do my parents, but they don't get that. My ex doesn't care about them and he doesn't do FB.\n\nWhat I noticed is ex-MIL has been taking my photos and sharing them with her friends and family. She has 1000+ friends, a lot of them she doesn't even know that well. I don't want her sharing the photos. She won't stop.\n\nSo my petty revenge. She doesn't get to see a lot of my posts. I put her on one of those \"All Friends except...\" thing. The only photos she gets to see are those that have me in them. She can see the kids, but she gets to see my face too and she doesn't like sharing those ones. She hasn't said anything yet, but I'm sure she's seething. She's the only family member left on his side and our mutual friends are only my parents and they won't share things with her now that I've told them what's going on.\n\nIt really is pretty. My friends tell me so. But it's feels good. She can't exactly say that she doesn't get to see photos of the kids.",

Have a pear shape with big thighs and c cup chest.On the curvier side but still big. I had always been very insecure and had body image issues but then became very confident. I was very nice and always smiling to people as well as dressing with clothes that appeal to my shape. Yes a lil tight but no cleavage nor short dresses skirts. Idk if it’s conceited of me to say but I have a came along way since being the shy baggy clothed duff from my highschool. Well there’s this woman who is well into her 40’s who is big too.  She would come in with crocs baggy pajama pants and super baggy shirts with out of bed hair. She would always stare at me almost in anger or talk about me as well. I never cared because I had gotten used to it. Until she started becoming bolder by coming up to me and nitpicking my clothes. For reference the first time she came up to me I had a long cardigan and a tube top jumpsuit. I have a bigger bottom then my chest so it came to a surprise when she had said my breasts were out and that I needed to cover up. As she proceeded to tug at my jumpsuit. I cried in the bathroom by how embarrassed I was and went to my supervisor about this asking if I was out of dress code. She said no and said she’d talk to her. Mind you I didn’t know they were besties… so I go about my shift. This happens two more times and no resolution. My last straw came when she started making a scene in front of my coworkers. I was wearing a knee length skirt with a sweater. As I’m talking to a coworker and others are around she comes up and says “again!?! It’s as if your asking for attention!” Confused I look around and ask what does she mean. She points at my legs and says I’m practically naked. My skirt had lifted an inch up from my knee from shifting around in my seat. So I stand up and say out loud for everybody to hear “why do you constantly pick on me? Is it really my clothes or is it something different like the color of my skin I’m really curious because you constantly are messing with me and aren’t even worried about your agents.” (She was a supervisor for a neighboring company cubicle but constantly by our desks to try and flirt with the male workers) she then started stuttering and darting her eyes around realizing everybody started looking and standing from their desks. She quickly said “ no no ! It’s not like that I’m just trying to watch out for you! You know big girl to big girl. Just wasn’t sure if you were ok with what u we’re wearing” I say “clearly I’m here working and I have my own supervisor to lmk if I am out of dress code”. After that it was nothing but smiles and constantly offering me snacks. Sorry for the long post but still makes me chuckle to this day.",

        "text": "This one goes back a ways.  In the early 90s, I was at Naval boot camp in Orlando.  Our company was a bunch of fuckups and we had extra hard Company Commanders (Drill Instructors), so we didn't earn normal privileges (sitting in chairs at tables in berthing, etc.) for weeks longer than most other companies.  And our at-night recreation was abolished (normally things relax after a few weeks and you get a few hours to goof off).  Not us.  The CCs scanned all mail and any \"comfort\" items were stashed until we met their standards.  Whatever.\n\nWell, the recruit who collected the mail was a buddy of mine and spirited away a small, magnetic chess set my parents had sent me.  So, for a few nights my friends and I played chess and I would play cat and mouse with the chess set so the CCs wouldn't find it when they inevitably rifled through my and everyone's shit.  \n\nWell, one morning after reveille, with the entire company at attention, the CCs storm over to my bunk and holler, \"Where is it, Seaman (my last name)?\"  \n\n\"What sir and ma'am?\"  \n\n\"The goddamn chess set?\"  Uggh.  Busted.  I gave it to them.\n\nThey were fucking SEETHING.  \"Who did you play chess with?\" they demanded.\n\n\"I played by myself, sir and ma'am.\"\n\n\"You're lying, Seaman (my name).  We want the names by chow.  If not, you'll go to IT every morning until you give us the names.\"\n\nI refused of course and I went to IT (intensive training, meaning before reveille you have to go to the gym and get cycled \\[pushups, sit ups, 8-count bodybuilders, etc. while being screamed at\\]) every morning for a half hour to forty minutes while everyone else slept.  I did this with whomever was in trouble that day from whatever company.  Usually, like 10 or so recruits.  CCs from the whole base took turns being the morning bad guy.  The IT experience had two effects.  1. It made me look really good because every morning the CCs would accost me for the names in front of everyone and every morning I insisted I played alone, which made me popular with the company and 2. I was furious that someone snitched on me.\n\nGood news when you have a company of eighty-eight young men, word gets around and after a few days I find out who snitched.  Cue the revenge.\n\nOne of the things the Navy harps on is \"attention to detail\".  They drill this into you by checking your bunk, uniform, locker, etc.  And they're assholes about it for good reason.  One doesn't really learn why until you get to the fleet.  In boot camp it just seems stupid for them to dump everybody's shit on the floor and then scream \"go\" and watch the entire company scramble to put everything back in it's exact place.\n\nThe CCs loved doing this just after 2nd chow (lunch).  Immediately afterward, they'd inspect and whomever had 'hits' got a quick cycling, which they'd do until everyone had been inspected.  Afterward the CCs would scream for everyone to line up and we'd go off to march, run, qualify with rifles, whatever.  Well, Orlando is damn hot in the summer and the CCs were, as they should be, bellowing about how important is was we hydrate often.  And that's what they'd call it.  We'd be on the grinder (parking lot) getting cycled and they yell, \"Hydrate\".  And we'd all drink from our canteens.  \n\nThe canteen location when they'd do inspection was on the right rear corner of your locker.  On this day, my buddy, the same guy who gave me the chess set, had snared a small tube of strong glue (not Elmer's, more like superglue) on his travels.  Guy got some extra liberty as he was the company runner.  At any rate, me and this guy snuck into our berthing after lunch and glued the snitch's canteen to the top of his locker.  We used almost the whole tube.\n\nAfter afternoon inspection when the CCs hollered for everyone to line up, everyone scrambled into line while snitch-boy struggled with his canteen.  It popped off, but not for like 30 seconds with the CCs going ape shit.  Luckily the CCs were on the other side of the berthing at the head of the line and couldn't really see what snitchy was struggling with.  The disruption lasted long enough for snitch-boy to join me at IT the next morning.\n\nEverything worked out well because after a few weeks of IT, the CCs stopped making me go as I was doing everything else right.  I think they secretly respected that I didn't squeal.",

        "text": "This happened in the early 2000s.\n\nIn middle and highschool, I was bullied a lot specifically by one girl.  She was absolutely awful to me and I hated her for it.  She ended up getting pregnant at an early age, like 16 or 17 and dropped out of school. \n\nRight after highschool ended, I was 18 and a shift manager at a local grocery store supervising cashiers, placing them on register, running around to get things for people, and making sure the checkout lanes were running smoothly.  One of the duties was to process food stamps, EBT, and WIC checks when they came up; they needed a manager override.\n\nOne day, (we'll call her \"Jessica\" because that was her name and she was a cunt) Jessica comes into the store with her toddler and another baby.  I noticed her come in because the entrance is near the cashiers, sneered to myself, but whatevered and went back to work.  About 30 minutes later, one of the cashiers turns their blinking light on meaning they need assistance.  I head over and there is jessicunt with her groceries and WIC checks.\n\nWith WIC checks, you had to buy very specific items listed on the checks, such as milk, baby formula, bread, cheese, etc. and they are good only up to a certain dollar value AND there were often multiple checks so you would have 5 or 6 separate transactions for one person, processing them individually and needing an override for each one.  They also had expiration dates. It was a tedious step by step process and we had to follow all the rules.\n\nI have never judged people for using benefits; if someone needs help, they need help and I don't care.  However, I definitely judged people named Jessica that made my life hell in school (but not for using the WIC program, just for being a shitty person).\n\nThe cashier starts to ring through the first order and it was a little awkward because Jessica definitely knew who I was and here I am helping her. I don't say anything to her at all, just wait until the cashier is done with scanning.  I go to process the check through when I notice that the check is expired by about a week. I look through them all and they're ALL expired, about 5 of them.  I say to her that the checks are all expired and we can't run them through (which is true, we can't, they would not have been honored and the store would be just giving her all of those groceries and I would be in deep shit if I let it go through).\n\nShe proceeds to flip out. I actually felt bad because her kids needed that food but couldn't get it due to their mother's incompetence. She starts saying we can run them through and that we've done it before (yea, no, we haven't, you CAN'T). I explain why we can't. She gets louder and says the only reason I'm not doing it, I shit you not, is because she bullied me in school.  Man, what a vindication it was that she admitted being a shitbag just to try and get her groceries.\n\nI explain once more and she asks to see my manager. I'm frustrated at this point because she is making a scene and people are looking so I say \"ok\" and go to the office to get the front end manager. I explain the situation to the manager, which isn't an unheard of problem, but the tantrum part is a bigger deal to the manager.\n\nManager comes out, says I am correct to her and that we cannot make an exception.  She continues to be loud and blaming me for not running the checks through.  So my manager says \"it's time for you to go.\" Yelling the entire way out of the store without her groceries, I just started to load up her cart and prepare it for restocking.\n\nI felt bad for those kids for their shitty mother and I don't wish that upon people that need food, however I will cherish the moment that an absolute shit person fucked up, admitted to being a shitty person in order to try and get her groceries, recanted and blamed me for her ineptitude, and had to eat shit for being shitty and late with her checks.  She did it to herself and I feel no remorse for her whatsoever. Jessica, of you're reading this, fuck you.\n\nTl;Dr bully from school waited too long to cash WIC checks, couldn't get groceries at store I worked, flipped out, removed from store.\n\nAlso, I'll add that I am not dwelling on being bullied in school anymore and I used more colorful language for the sake of the story. Being bullied was just a thing that happened and I'm over it.",
