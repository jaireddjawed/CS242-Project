        "text": "In my village in India, my grandmother told me that there is a lot of missionaries there now trying to \"recruit\" people into joining their religion. I won't say which religion these missionaries are a part of. What they will do is go to the poor, and give them food. They will do so for 2-3 days. And after, they will stop. They will however, continue giving them aid if they join their religion. Because of this, a lot of people in our village, mainly the poor, have changed their religion now, in order to get food.\n\nMy question to you is , why does it have to be like this?  Does it really represent your beliefs? That you will only help people if they become christian/jew/muslim/hindu whatever? I thought religion was supposed to be nice. This is not nice. I don't think this is what your god wants. Is this what you want?",

        "author": "djdubyah",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/10cmdlq/how_does_faith_manifest/",
        "text": "12 year old stepson has been attending church with grandma for about a year.  Went and got baptized, now without trying to be jaded, I know attending and even baptism was done solely because he knows that Grandma really, really wants that for him.\n\nI've by and large kept my mouth shut, organized religion and I parted ways in my 20's, I won't bore with my manifesto as to why. I see him struggling as I struggled at his age though.  He is trying to rationalize in this modern age what he is told at church to believe based on faith...  He has so many questions, because of course when he drills down in bible study or with his youth minister on specifics that don't add up, he is told  to have faith. With the tagline, \"what does it hurt to believe?\"  \n\nWow, if only it were that easy!  \n\nWe teach our kids all day long in school, STEM, question everything, research, investigate, learn... and then Sunday, shh, don't question, just believe, baby.\"  I think that the Christian stance that agnostic's and atheists are lazy is living life with blinders on.  I've heard such as those half-assed a personal relationship with God, fell short, formed an opinion and then never tried further.  My journey could not be any different. \n\n I wanted to believe as I was taught, I wanted what I saw in the people around me.  I wanted that ability to give a hurt or a fear up to a loving God.  To commune with him as my peers did.  That when I lay prostrate on the ground screaming in pain and terror and need up to this caring Father, I would hear that small quiet voice.  I would see his hand in my life, see a miracle, feel blessed, feel loved, safe, comforted.  I didn't want proof; I didn't need a Turin shroud or a petrified piece of the Ark to prove God's existence.   I wanted what I saw others receiving.   How I knew that God existed because I saw how other's faith, their belief in him gave them peace.  \n\nBut then, why has God forsaken me?  What did I do that turned him against me?  Friends would weep, tears streaming, in joy when they would pray, say they felt his presence, felt in-tune, loved.  When I prayed, and I mean on bended knee and white knuckled clasped hands, praying to feel what they felt, to know him, just for a moment, a taste as it were, to know beyond debate there was a holy father, and he was going to make everything ok it felt like I was shouting into a deep, black well... A void, that just ate my pleas, without even the consideration of echoing them back.  After years of trying to commune with my God, I stopped praying. \n\n I consider myself as best defined as a hybrid Christian agnostic and Christian Atheist.  I have kept abreast of secular readings and teachings, because I believe or at least am trying really hard to believe that God does exist and come to terms that I was one of his tests of faith, maybe a side-bet like Job.  That my just rewards for living a life shut out from him will be one of eternal closeness on the other side of the coffin lid.  And there is the rub.  I hope, I do not have faith.  How does one even teach faith?  Was it because my own parents had no belief system, so my first experience at church wasn't until I was 5 or 6?  Had my heathen lifestyle already burnt all bridges with God because I was not spoon-fed him and his miracles alongside Santa and the tooth fairy?  I'll never know, sadly.\n\nThat aside, how do I help guide my son towards faith, and not destroy it for him?  I want for him to experience that rapture and I don't want to lie to him.  I can't give him the same speech he hears at church that it's better to be safe then sorry.  Faith should consist of more than 'believe or consequence', or as a band-aid to gloss over glaring inconsistency. Faith shouldn't mean the opposite of science.  The age of these kids just accepting what they are told by an adult is done.  When the entire world sits there as a website or app on phone, hearing a parable about the benefits of following the golden rule or that before history was properly documented there might have been some real magic on this earth.  And not to despair, even though God turned off his mic 2,000 years ago, and more human souls are alive then have died ever from Adam on, he still cares for and loves you specifically.\n\nBut again, John 7:17 told me if I would do his will, I would know Him.  So maybe I just didn't have the true grit of a handfast Christian to doggedly pursue as only those worthy of his embrace are. If I know anything after 40 years on this earth, it's that I know nothing at all.  \n\nThanks for reading if you did so, and would love to hear others if they can help me understand really anything in this life.",

        "text": " ***I REALLY WANT SOME ANSWERS AND DEBATES ON THIS! IV BEEN ASKING BUT CANNOT EVEN GET DEBATES OR GOOD RELIABLE ANSWERS FROM PEOPLE ON THIS.***\n\nBefore I start this is not me trying to demonize Christianity.  Even Christians can admit that the early church's actions were bad and nor am I trying to say all Christians do these things. im not saying Christianity is a bad religion but the questions im asking deserve to be answered. These are mostly questions not me saying that the religion is bad. I want to clear this up before I start.\n\nnow then..\n\nIm a practicing Pagan and in my time working with the gods Iv noticed one thing. When you work with a god you allow them into your heart and thus they have influence over your life to a point. They can help you see things differently and help you understand things you may not understand before. Many Christians claim they have allowed Jesus into their hearts and they see the world so much differently now that hes with them... But then why would christians go on and proceed to do Violant things and use their faith as a leverage to continue spreading abuse? More importantly why do most (Not all so im not including you if you do not do so) Christians try to convert you to their faith even if you do not reside with it?\n\nIf the Bible is in fact the most perfect word of god with 0 contradictions (Like alot of apologists want to say) then why was it able to be abused? Why would god not make his word perfect enough to where it couldn't be abused? Why would he make it so open to interpretation that it was able to divide the early church and cause the catholic vs Baptist war? Why was the catholic reformation even needed in the first place if the word is so perfect? All of this would soon lead to the revolutionary war. Shouldn't none of these things have happened if the words were perfect? But yet all of these people claimed they were sons of god... this doesnt make sense. We cant say they werent Christian because saying such would almost debase modern Christianity itself sense most of Christian  beliefs stem from them. to say early Christians are wrong, would mean no one is actually practicing Christianity (especially sense the belief was very different in the beginning).  \n\nI do Know a rebuttal to this that alot of apologists want to use. \"The devils influence is stronger then gods\" (Which is kinda bad sense it imply satan is stronger then god) Or \"god gave us free will and this is why we did it.\" I personally say that is not an excuse. God is all powerful (according to christians) Shouldn't he have had the power to step in? Shouldn't he have the power to stand up for the rights of other religious people? I mean if you assume Noahs ark is a true story we see he wiped out millions just because they disobeyed him. Why didnt he do that to a extent with his own faith? Isnt that worse? Knowing your gods word yet still changing it? Why didnt he at least protect the innocents of other faiths? It was his faiths fault that other faiths were attacked and killed (Egyptians, pagan even jewish people). Even if you want to say that Christians can be separated, god should have stood up for the other people who practiced other teachings. He loves the world right? Then even if people choose not to worship him he would still protect them from his own people wouldnt he? If not then thats not love. A mother who actually loved her son would stand in front of a bullet if it ment she would save him, even if that son hated her. If god loved the world he would do the same. Yet he didnt and watched and witches and even people of his own faith were burned and stoned. Surly he could have sent a rain storm so hard it quelled the fire and protect those who did not follow him? Freak accidents happen all the time, why do nothing when other are under attack? \n\nWhat of modern Christianity? All these 2. billion people who claim to be christian and yet we have still the same problems of separation between christians and christians, and christians vs the rest of the world. But it makes no sense how a religion that was based our unity (supposed) can be turned into this. Or how a all powerful god would allow this to happen. I understand people want to put the blame on humanity and off of god but this is gods fault. Its one thing when its something we do like climate change but its another thing when its his people that caused the problem.\n\nI want other Christians/atheists interpretation of these things and to hear their explanations for these questions and why they think it happened.\n\nOnce Again I dont want to come off a disrespectful to individuals or Christians, I just want to be able to hear what others have to say on these things. Iv been trying to get answers and debate people on these things, but yet I cannot get anywhere with these questions. Its as if they are not questions to be asked.  thanks so much for any replys!",

        "text": "Does anybody here consider themselves a Christian without following the Bible? I mean by this that Christianity existed before the compilation of the Bible, which is itself technically an arbitrary collection of books; there are many Christian texts, and perhaps even Jewish, which do not feature in your standard Bible. On Wikipedia I can see many thirty or more different Gospels listed at least! Imagine how unwieldy the Bible would be if all known Christian and Jewish texts were included? Wow. A lot of division among Christians I think stems from interpretation of the Bible, and it's also what puts a lot of people off from being Christian--instruction manual not clear!!! Some part of me thinks whatever Jewish/Christian documents are the oldest are perhaps the safest to trust--that you should play it safe and go for the simplest Christianity. You could say Tolstoy with his 'Gospel in Brief' or C.S. Lewis with his 'Mere Christianity' both attempt this.\n\nI know 'sola scriptura' is a protestant thing, but 'orthodox Christianity' still seems heavily wed to the Bible; a lot of the songs, for example, I believe are directly from the Bible. Could Christianity exist without the Bible? Is a pre-Biblical Christianity possible today, or is it lost to the sands of time--or subject to even more controversy over which texts to trust, which is in effect the same situation?\n\nI know there have been various Christians throughout history who have either ignored the Old Testament, ignored writings by Apostle Paul, among other things; not to mention orthodox Christian sects seem to have disagreements on what exactly should be in the Bible. Luther didn't like certain bible books, etc. So it seems rather up to the individual, or intense scholarly debate, which books of the bible to pay attention to. It's curious to me how the 'Bible' is even spoke of as a unitary thing. It half seems to me like individuals should take it on a book by book matter, even perhaps considering the non-standard (perhaps even 'heretical') Christian and Jewish writings too. Instead, people just seem to go along with what their church hands them. You could conceivably own, for example, only five books of the Bible and be a 'Christian', and discard the rest as trivial, folklore, ethnic mythology, excessive, and so forth. I think there's even a term in theology for this view that certain Biblical books as 'excessive' or 'trivial' and shouldn't really be in the canon.\n\nNot sure where I'm going with this but well it's a Saturday evening and I follow wherever my curiosity leads me...\n\nThe floor is yours :)",

        "text": "Why do we have imagination? Ever since I became an adult I have yearned for magic. As a child it was so easy to just dip into imaginary worlds. And I can still do it, but I always know that it is not real real. I would love little more than for a little elf to visit me, or a domovoy to be staring at me from out of his beard from the corner of the room, or for a dragon to wink at me from some rocky outcrop above some mountainous wooded valley... I feel I will go the grave with this yearning. What is the point of such an insatiable desire? Why do we have folk tales which tell of strange beings living among us almost invisibly, and yet sometimes quiet apparently? What is the point? Why do we like lying to ourselves?\n\nI love the beauty within nature, etc.‚Äîand actually feel wrong wroting 'etc.'‚Äî, but I can't entirely budge this interest, this little urge for magical things. And I'm not the only one. I seem to be a part of a tradition of chronically immature men.\n\nMaybe the original 'dreamers' actually had schizophrenia, as I spoke with one woman with schizophrenia and she said one time she did see an elf. But I don't. And many don't. And yet we in our hearts still are drawn to these mythical worlds. Why? Why is it like we both are made for this world and yet are not? It feels stupid, to have an urge for something not seemingly there.\n\nDoes anybody have any thoughts on this? Similar struggle? Or can you tell me how to be away with the fairies, ha ha?\n\nI enjoy reading fantasy fiction, but I struggle to reconcile that affection with sensible reality, which almost makes me want to 'grow out' of my fantastical urge and take more interest in the sensible world.",
