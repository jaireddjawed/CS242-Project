        "text": "I just watched USS Callister and while I loved the first half of it, there started to be major logical holes to the point where I actually felt robbed by the credits. \n\nThe biggest one for me was the fact that the whole sequence of irl Cole breaking into his house and stealing the DNA items didnt matter because Daly didnt wake up anyways.\n       Also, Daly didnt know that the DNA items were taken and it was stated earlier that they had tried the wormhole method but Daly just scanned them back in. With that logic why the fuck did he care about catching them so bad? He wasnt aware that his ability to rescan them was gone. If anything he shouldve been like ‚ÄúGo in that wormhole and Ill rescan you all with no mouth!!‚Äù or a threat. That would be more in line with his character and knowledge of the situation. \n         Another thing is why when he came back to the game at the lake didnt he just beam himself back to the Callister? He chose to go to that shitty ship.. which is fine if hes trying to immerse himself BUT he is acting like the situation is game-threatening so wouldnt he use his ‚ÄúGod‚Äù-like powers to put a stop to it? \n\n        There were a couple more small ones here and there, and I loved the opposites of Daly in the real world and how he was able to ‚Äúget revenge‚Äù on his coworkers through his ability to code and mod. And I caught many of the Star Trek/70s space cliches (im sure you caught more). \n\nBut my final point is that Im bashing this episode because it lured me in with this great premise and storyline and then event after event exposed more and more holes in the logic.

        "text": "If you recall, at the end of the episode ‚ÄòWhite Christmas‚Äô, the character, after his confession is left alone in the cabin, as a man outside sets his time for 1000 years per minute. To scale, this would be more than 1,400,000 years if he did eventually erase him. While outside, only a day would have passed.\n\nFocusing on this, it is possibly the worst thing that can ever happen to a person. Just imagine the same thing forever, trapped in a small cabin, except it‚Äôs not forever, and there is an end. One day, in 1.4 million years, which is incomprehensible and basically an eternity, it will end. Knowing that one day his torment will end, because he‚Äôs in a machine and it cannot run forever, he is forced to wait and wonder when it will end, for 1.4 MILLION YEARS. For over 1 million years, this man is forced to wonder to himself, when will this end, if ever? \n\nThis brings us to my largest fear, an eternity like this. Sure, I‚Äôd love to live forever in a world like heaven. But would you really want to live forever in a world like this man did, with absolutely nothing to do? Sure, it‚Äôs life forever, but under the cost of infinite boredom (probably one of the worst punishments). Or would you rather be erased from existence, gone forever; never knowing again? Is this possibly the worst punishment in existence? Is this a realistic taste of what hell would be like?",

Black Mirror usually tries to be fairly consistent with its science and it felt out of place as something obviously dumb.\n\nEspecially as it would have been incredibly easy to fix.\n\nIt‚Äôs probably safe to assume that everyone at Callister Inc has been inside Infinity. Even Walton, who obviously cares little about the product beyond it making him rich and successful, must have logged in at least once before.\n\nWouldn‚Äôt it have been easier to have Daly extract replicas of their memories and personalities from Infinity, instead of magicing it out of saliva and such?\n\nThis also fits much better with Daly‚Äôs character as a master coder who built Infinity from scratch. The DNA thing means he‚Äôs also a master geneticist, which is possible but odd.\n\nHe could even keep his copies in an external HD for safekeeping, allowing all of the Nanette break in stuff to go ahead as usual.\n\nIn the end I‚Äôm happy to wave off the dumb science because the so was so entertaining, but I do think it was a weird misstep.",

There was almost always something industrial running through it, like pipelines or factories blowing clouds of smoke into the air. I wondered why these locations were chosen because they seem much more deliberate than usual for the show. Maybe corruption of purity?

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmirror/comments/7yq5uh/connections_between_crocodile_and_fargo_movie/",
        "text": "I recently watched *Fargo* for the first time and I was extremely impressed with it. For the record, I'll be checking out the show soon (\"three cheers for Captain Daly\" and all that!).\n\nHowever, I couldn't help forging connections in my mind between that movie and 'Crocodile'.\n\nFirst up, it's **the setting**.\n\n*Fargo* is famously set in North Dakota and Minnesota, the snowy landscapes often a focus of the visuals. \n\nNot only does this imagery play a role in both works I am examining, but the Coen brothers' movie carries a distinct Norwegian flavour throughout its North American setting. *Black Mirror*, however, takes a British cast of characters and transplants them into an Icelandic setting. Whether or not it is Iceland or a future Britain remains unconfirmed, but architectural and infrastructural styles seen in 'Crocodile' suggest it is indeed the former. \n\nLandscape shots featuring vehicles are also typical and memorable of each work.\n\nAnd now for **the plot and characters**.\n\nOn the surface, the storylines are very different between *Fargo* and 'Crocodile'. However, they repeatedly hit beats with a lot in common, both structurally and contextually.\n\nIn *Fargo*, Lundegaard hires two criminals to kidnap his wife as part of an extortion plot. The inept criminals' plan soon leads to multiple brutal murders despite its original intention to end in a feigned resolution. Fans of *Black Mirror* will no doubt recall a similar spiral into serial killing demonstrated by Mia, though it should be noted that her arc started off pretty grim in the first place. \n\nAn unusually fair way into each story we are introduced to our female protagonist, who serves as an investigator to previously established crimes. I believe this story element is of considerable interest because of how relatively unusual this mechanic is and, combined with other noted similarities, I have a strong suspicion that Charlie Brooker may be a Coen brothers admirer!\n\nNeither character is fully aware of the extent to which their investigations will lead, and they are fleshed-out by scenes introducing us to their relationships with their husbands.\n\nAnother important similarity on this note would be that of children. *Fargo*'s Marge is pregnant and Shazia from 'Crocodile' has a very young son. A key difference, however, would be that this ends much worse for Shazia and her family (and, hell, that's an understatement). \n\nOn the subject of family, both Mia and Jerry are keeping major secrets from theirs, and we are given intentionally awkward domestic scenes in which the viewer is fully aware of the situation but the secondary characters are not. The scenes in Mia's home remind me of those in which Jerry attempts to keep up the facade of his wife's disappearance for his distraught son.\n\nMore coincidentally, but also of note, both crimes at the focus of these stories primarily involve a vehicle as a clue (the car from Lundegaard's salesroom and the pizza van respectively). \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe unusual settings and slightly odd structure lead me to believe that the similarities are, in fact, deliberate. I liked 'Crocodile' to begin with (I know it's not the most popular episode ever, heh) but now I can appreciate it even more after watching its excellent, potential inspiration. \n\nIf this is true, 'Crocodile' is a great example of a good homage without in any way being a rip-off. Confirmation from Charlie on this matter would be great someday.\n\n&gt;Yah.\n\nEDIT: on a slightly unrelated note, the setting being Britain really does not add up in terms of geography and architecture, particularly the older stuff. I like to think that a lot of people migrated to Iceland following the climate stuff mentioned in Mia's speech.",

Doing the same thing for years now, he knows how to fool and influence people, and arrange with the other judges to \"choose their fate\", while doing something more sinister behind the scenes.\n\nWhen Judge Hope says his line \"Authenticity is woefully in short supply\", is he ACTUALLY expressing his emotions, or putting on a show, trying to calm down the situation, and make everything end good for the rest of the cast as well as the system itself?\n\nKeep in mind, he would not have been appointed as a live audience jury member if he did not know how to react to these situations. They would just be edited and cut out like with the rest of the entertainment provided to the humans in the 15 Million Merits society.\n\nI know i'm just nitpicking here, but how did *YOU* guys interpret this?",

While that's obviously helpful for viewers to more immediately recognize this otherwise normal looking piece of hardware, this seems to have implications for both stories. We know at the end of Callister that the protagonist in real life broke into Daly's house to steal the lollipop and other samples specifically. We can presume that Daly died at the end of Callister, not being able to get out of his plugged in state until his body succumbed to neglect and that somehow, perhaps through the clones/cookies he made of these people that are now \"on the internet\" that they got the message out about how screwed up he was and that's how this sampler wound up in a crime artifact museum. But the lollipop wasn't there at the crime scene. So either Rolo has placed a fake one there to make his story better, or, the protagonist in real life was caught or otherwise turned over the evidence and that's the actual lollipop used to create the CEO's son.",

I enjoyed Netflix to much that I learned about Black Mirror. The first episode was a bit much for a pilot, but the next two did it justice. I love every episode sooo much. I want to binge the rest today now. Plz send help. On to Crocodile I suppose!\n\nP.s. I have the White Bear image as my wallpaper",

The episode features Michael, the manager of the company, in a predicament where he promised to pay college tuition for an elementary school class. They are grown up now and close to graduation but Michael doesn‚Äôt even have close to enough money to pay their tuition. When Michael is invited to the school, they show him an entire dance routine dedicated to how generous he is and give speeches about Michael being their role model. Michael does the only thing he can do: tell the kids that he can‚Äôt pay their tuition. He feels incredibly terrible, as would any person put in this situation, and this episode is known to be one of the hardest, most awkward episodes to watch in the history of television. There‚Äôs even a sub dedicated to this one episode r/cantwatchscottstots\n\nI would say Men Against Fire and Crocodile are the hardest to watch. I had to look away so many times and have only watched both of those episodes once. The sheer guilt both of the characters go through is unexplainable and the society they live in has just come to make this the norm. \n\nTLDR: What‚Äôs the hardest episode to watch?\n\n",
