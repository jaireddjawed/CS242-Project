You bet it is. At moments, it\u2019s like the action film as liturgical church service. Yet the movie is conceived as a knowingly overstuffed gift to \u201cJohn Wick\u201d fans, and on that level it succeeds.\n\nDeadline:\n\n>More. More. More. That seems to be the mantra for the fourth edition in the wildly successful *John Wick* franchise. There is certainly more action with a whopping 14 action sequences, nearly four times the amount in previous *Wick* flicks; more locations including a Bond-like global journey from Jordan to Japan to Paris to Berlin; and like so many recent films more running time at 169 minutes, and you will want to stay right to the end of the end credits to get the most bang for your bucks. \n\nSlashfilm (9\/10):\n\n>By this point, someone reading a \"John Wick: Chapter 4\" movie review already has an opinion on the \"John Wick\" franchise. If more world-building, bigger action, and a deeper embrace of what its leading man does well all perk up your ears, you know what you need to know. As someone who has been in the tank for these movies for nearly a decade now, the fourth film is everything I wanted out of these movies. Yeah, I'm thinking he's back.\n\nEntertainment Weekly (B+):\n\n>*John Wick: Chapter 4*, in theaters this Friday, does not let a good concept rest; at 169 minutes, it is by far the longest installment to date, and easily the most relentless. As a moviegoing experience, it is also patently ridiculous and mostly very fun: the platonic ideal of a globe-hopping meatbag action thriller taken to its gloriously illogical extreme.  \n\nThe Wrap:\n\n>Though it reaches a rushed conclusion, \u201cJohn Wick 4\u201d barrels along with charming idiosyncrasy. Reeves delivers each line as though he has just learned to speak for the first time. A fire-blasting shot gun gets some excellent screen time. Lausten\u2019s cinematography has never been more inventive. Even when it drags \u2014 169 minutes is a lot of time to fill, even for this masterful crew \u2014 the film gamely mixes comedy, action, and drama into one truly satisfying cocktail. If you\u2019re more inclined to wait for streaming, make an exception just this once. Every audacious set piece, costume, and fight scene was clearly, lovingly made for the biggest of all big screens. \n\nThe Playlist (A):\n\n>Pure power, \u201cJohn Wick: Chapter 4\u201d is as exhilarating as it is exhausting. With this wildly satisfying world tour de force, Reeves\u2019 Wick transcends icon status delivering the perfect bone-crunching crescendo to one of the great action franchises in cinema history. It\u2019s pure gold. \n\n\\---\n\n**Release Date:** March 24\n\n**Runtime:** 2h 49m\n\n**Synopsis:**\n\nJohn Wick (Keanu Reeves) uncovers a path to defeating the High Table.

They are open for discussion but at the end of the day I have final say.\n\n- To win, you must be the first to e-mail the mod account with a picture or screenshot of the winning card, your reddit username, and the serial number on the card plainly visible or included in the e-mail. The e-mail address is MovieMods@gmail.com. If you fail to do any of those things you will not win. \n\n- 5 in a row wins. Horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. None of this weird four corners bullshit.\n\n- Obviously, we cannot read your card with big markings on it. Try using the X's or small dots in the corner. As long as we can still read the card you're good. If we cannot read the card your winning card may not be counted.\n\n- First three valid e-mails win. Make BINGO! The subject. **You have to call BINGO those are the rules of Bingo. Don't make me rescind your rightful win because you did not exclaim Bingo because I totally will.** There are prizes involved. Winners will be announced here in OP once the serial numbers are verified.\n\n- If you are playing to win and you send us a game card, please be ready to cite the used spots. If we ask when something happened don't respond with, \"I don't remember, but it happened.\" Be ready to recall it with a somewhat accurate when. Most likely we won't have to ask because we'll all be watching, but keep track just in case. Obviously if I make a ruling on something in the thread, you're safe to mark it. If you have any questions about a cell, post them in this thread **and be sure to quote the cell you're referring to.**\n\n- This is for fun. Yes, there are prizes, but they won't be anything to write home about. Don't take it too seriously and don't spend too much time arguing with official rulings. \n\n- This should go without saying, but only things shown on screen during the ceremony will count. No first hand accounts or background activities. Also, no pre-show. No one wants the game to be over before it begins!\n\n---\n\nHave fun and a big thanks to print-bingo.com helping make this fun and easy for everyone!","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1678665085.0},{"title":"What ever happened to Leon ( The fast and the Furious) ?","author":"Sad_Sam86","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/movies\/comments\/11qc1ca\/what_ever_happened_to_leon_the_fast_and_the\/","text":"Greetings guys , I've been watching the fast saga since i was a boy and fell in love with it especially since it had tuner cars and that 2000s atmosphere and lovely actors as well , i liked Leon allot his character was great but sadly he made no comeback and his character suddenly got forgotten, he's in my top 5 f &f characters\n Is he coming to fast X ? \nPS: sorry this isn't really a movie thing but it's close to it xD .","upvote_ratio":0.56,"created_utc":1678719636.0},{"title":"Why aren't martial arts movies as popular as they used to be in the west?","author":"Aquanort357","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/movies\/comments\/11qpns1\/why_arent_martial_arts_movies_as_popular_as_they\/","text":"Y'know, I can't help but wonder why martial arts movies don't seem to have the same cultural impact they once had in North America and Europe. Despite the occasional blockbuster like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, or Ip Man, most martial arts films today are relegated to niche audiences or straight-to-video releases, whereas in their countries of origin (China, Japan, Korea, etc.), they still dominate the box office and the cultural conversation. So, why is that? What happened to the popularity of martial arts movies in the west?\n\nI'm not sure if it's due to oversaturation, lack of novelty, cultural differences, shifts in taste, or a combination of factors, but I'm curious to hear other people's opinions. Did the glut of low-budget, poorly dubbed \"chop-socky\" flicks from the 70s and 80s tarnish the genre's reputation in the west? Did the rise of other genres like superhero movies, sci-fi, or horror push martial arts movies to the margins? Or did western audiences simply get tired of seeing the same tropes and archetypes played out over and over again?\n\nMoreover, I wonder if there's any hope for a revival or reinvention of the martial arts genre in the west. Are there any filmmakers, actors, or trends that could bring back the excitement and appeal of classics like Enter the Dragon or The Karate Kid? Or is martial arts destined to remain a niche interest, appreciated mainly by die-hard fans and connoisseurs?\n\nI'm eager to hear other people's perspectives on this issue, especially those who may have different cultural backgrounds or experiences with martial arts movies. What do you think? Why have martial arts movies lost their popularity in the west, and what, if anything, can be done about it?","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678750105.0},{"title":"Come and See (1985) is the greatest film ever made","author":"TheNonArtist","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/movies\/comments\/11qoy0r\/come_and_see_1985_is_the_greatest_film_ever_made\/","text":"I just finished watching this film yesterday and it was one of the most profound movie-going experiences of my life. \n\nThe music: the absolute eerieness and terror the production brings legitimately made me clench my fists at many points throughout. Droning, subtle synths combined with epic swells of color at certain points, coupled with aching stabs of shrillness. I have never seen a movie so well integrate their music and sound design better, other than perhaps the Safdie Brothers' Good Time. \n\nThe acting: I thought it was bad at first, but as the movie went on I realize how positively genius every performance is. Many of the actors, especially Glasha, have this almost trance-like quality to them, as if they were trying to forget reality itself and transcend into some other plane of existence. The lead, Aleksei Kravchenko, creates some incredibly unique facial expression that are positively bone-chilling in their uncannyness. Each performance sells the abject misery the Nazis brought with their invasion.\n\nThe setting: Dry, open tundra. Gray skies. Need I say more? Very well highlighted the bleakness of the characters' situations.\n\nI could go on and on. The shots are incredible, with those tense and well crafted long-takes that really help the viewer sink into the setting. It didn't even feel so much a war movie as a psychological horror movie about sinking slowly into the worst form of PTSD possible. \n\nAs you can probably tell, the movie is extremely dark, but for any cinemaphile out there I would argue it is a must watch. I have never had a film move me in such subtle ways and after I finished it I almost couldn't do anything else besides ponder it.

Clyde (Butler) should have already distrusted the government. He apparently worked for the CIA and focused on killing people. He must have seen a lot of innocent people getting killed by the us government without any justice being served. It's hard for me to believe seeing a plea deal would have set him off like it did or him not realizing he would have to take matters into this own hand. \n2. Clyde is too hateable as a protaganist and Nick\/Foxx is too likeable as an antagonist. \n   1. Nick is not a villain, he's just a cocky DA who cares about his career and made a plea deal. He's not corrupt, he's not actively trying to hurt people, he's genuinely doing what he thinks is the right thing. He even sympathizes with Clyde at the beginning, but knows he has a job to do. If they wanted to make him the villian, they should have made him more corrupt.   \n  \n   2. OTOH, Clyde starts off likeable, but ends just just being a mass murderer with no real plan. I was expecting something much more complicated and nuanced to incite real change. Clyde says he's not just out for vengeance, but to bring the system down. I don't really know how he's doing that or plans to do it. Killing everyone isn't really going to do anything other than have them be replaced with like minded people. I would have personally had Clyde work with the press and have bugs on the govt officials and show how they think they're above the law. For example, I thought he was recording the judge claim how she's a judge and can do whatever she wants...but no he just made her cell phone a killing device lol. \n\n**Plot holes**\n\n1. The robbery itself makes no sense. Two thugs just decide to show up at some random person's house and kill them? Clyde is ex-CIA and did some shady shit. I would expect he would have had some basic home security like a camera and not opening the front door when he's not expecting anyone without checking who's there. Something like how Batman's parents died sounds a bit more plausible vs. what happened here. \n2. It seems like a pretty open and shut case. There's DNA evidence and Clyde was conscious long enough to see what happened. I don't see how someone like that isn't getting more than 5 years and I'm sure that guy had a bunch of priors. \n3. Why does Clyde want to be in jail? What purpose does it serve? He could have just sat in his mission control and killed everyone. Him being in jail just was so he could be amused and see their reactions? For a guy who calculates every more I'm not sure what benefit he got being in jail.\n4. Killing his cell mate was random. He should have at least defended it and said he knew he was a murderer or did something horrible. That other dude could have just been in there for robbery or something. He could have easily gotten sent to solitary confinement without killing someone. \n5. What does Clyde actually want? He's putting the government officials in a lose-lose situation. On one hand if they give him what he wants that's what he's upset about...them making deals with murderers. OTOH if they don't give him what he wants, he kills them. His plan really makes no sense and it made me not really care what happens at the end. \n\nWas still an entertaining movie, but thought there was so much more potential","upvote_ratio":0.33,"created_utc":1678731344.0},{"title":"Hattie McDaniel winning Best Supporting Actress: 12th Oscars (1940)","author":"ceaguila84","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=e7t4pTNZshA&ab_channel=Oscars","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1678597059.0},{"title":"Any movies where the plot takes place in the span of 1 night?","author":"ohwhatj","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/movies\/comments\/11opg2y\/any_movies_where_the_plot_takes_place_in_the_span\/","text":"Can anyone recommend a movie where the whole movie takes place during the span of 1 night?

But apparently that's just not the case. Yes almost every movie comes out on some streaming service or another, but many of the big blockbusters like Top Gun Maverick and Spider-Man No Way Home are on lesser-subscribed ones like Paramount+ and Starz respectively, instead of streamers that everyone has like Netflix\/HBO\/etc. So why does nobody rent or purchase them digitally?\n\nI remember the days when people would go to Blockbuster every weekend to rent a movie; for digital movies it's nowhere near that often.

However, I couldn't help but feel there is another acceptance angle from the other way around, which also adds to Joy deciding to leave the bagel: Joy accepting her mother. I think this is a obvious thing, but no one talks about it which is why I'm asking here. \n\nThroughout the movie, Joy was trying to find an Evelyn who was just like her, and did so with the prime version the film focuses on. But with her rejecting the cynical look at life, Joy decides to kill herself alone, but is saved by her mother. The point behind getting her to reject death is pointing out how despite how there is multiple versions of Joy, Evelyn would always want to be with her. However within that dialogue, Evelyn points out the issues she has with Joy: getting fat, not calling her, etc. Pointing out that those issues are still there, but doesn't change the point of her accepting her daughter. \n\nWhich leads to Joy: how I see it is that, Joy came into grips over the fact that, this is Evelyn, this is her mother, her mother has issues because she is a human being, but this is who she is no matter what, and she cannot escape that, she has to accept it. Which led to her rejecting death.\n\nI know people might roll their eyes saying \"no duh\".

They round out the personalities of their characters, pack their screenplay (written with Michael Gilio) with zingy one-liners and cleverly timed asides, and calibrate the action sequences so they rarely feel auxiliary to the narrative.

A good fantasy film. A good adventure. And above all else, a good D&D film. Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is a phenomenal adaptation of fantasy while never prioritizing one audience (those who are TTRPG players and the ones who aren\u2019t) over the other. Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves makes my nerdy heart full.\n\n- [Kate Sanchez - But Why Tho? A Geek Community](https:\/\/butwhytho.net\/2023\/03\/dungeons-and-dragons-honor-among-thieves-review\/)\n\n> The Dungeons & Dragons movie, by design, eschews those flavors of bombast for something a little shaggier and a lot more winsome. By echoing the type of anachronistic medieval fantasy movies actually made in the \u201880s\u2014your Princess Brides and your Willows instead of J.R.R. Tolkien or George R.R. Martin\u2014the real magic at work here is a nonstop charm offensive.\n\n\n - [David Crow - Den of Geek](https:\/\/www.denofgeek.com\/movies\/dungeons-and-dragons-honor-among-thieves-review\/)\n\n>  It captures the joy of failing, running away, and coming up with a great solution that somehow just works, which is the real experience of any good D&D campaign.\n\n - [Richard Whittaker - Austin Chronicle](https:\/\/www.austinchronicle.com\/daily\/sxsw\/2023-03-10\/sxsw-film-review-dungeons-and-dragons-honor-among-thieves\/)\n\n> In place of strained references, Dungeons & Dragons, which premiered Friday night at the 2023 SXSW Film Festival, rewards the game\u2019s fans with a satisfying journey that emphasizes companionship, tenacity, and most importantly, playfulness above all else. In other words, the movie succeeds because it actually manages to capture what makes the game such fun to play.\n\n - [Laura Bradley - The Daily Beast](https:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/obsessed\/dungeons-and-dragons-honor-among-thieves-sxsw-review-it-rules)\n\n> \u201cDungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves\u201d conjures its own type of movie magic that proudly stands apart from other fantasy films. The heartfelt story, enchanting characters, dazzling visual effects, and fun-filled nature will allow the film to be a treasured classic. An adaptation of this caliber could be considered a roll of the dice to some, but \u201cDungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves\u201d has already proved itself to be an ironclad winner.\n\n- [Marisa Mirabal - Indiewire](https:\/\/www.indiewire.com\/2023\/03\/dungeons-dragons-honor-among-thieves-film-review-1234818367\/)\n\n> Throughout the film, there are moments of life-or-death stakes and even jolting jump scares. But this bounce, this sense of play, helps keep things light and fun so that Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves might be enjoyed by grown-ups and kids alike. Inclusivity is a major element of the movie, welcoming all kinds of fantasy fans, whether they played D&D or not. If you have, you'll likely yip and cheer as you recognize specific spells, items, and creatures. If you're a level nothing to this world, the script \u2014 by Daley, Goldstein, and Michael Gilio \u2014 swiftly gives enough context that you won't miss out on the fun. \n\n- [Kristy Puchko - Mashable](https:\/\/mashable.com\/article\/dungeons-and-dragons-honor-among-thieves-review)\n\n> When it comes to evaluating the greatness of movies, Gene Siskel was fond of asking if a film was as effective as a documentary of those same actors having lunch. But thanks to \u201cDungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,\u201d we now have a new question: did we enjoy a film as much as we would enjoy a recording of a \u2018Dungeons & Dragons\u2019 home game with the same cast? In the case of this movie, the answer feels very much like a yes. And if that\u2019s good enough for Siskel, it\u2019s good enough for me. \n\n- [Matthew Monagle - The Playlist](https:\/\/theplaylist.net\/dungeons-dragons-honor-among-thieves-review-chris-pine-company-score-a-critical-hit-sxsw-20230311\/)\n\n> The truth is that the game Dungeons & Dragons is often at its best when it\u2019s at its most ridiculously unpredictable and downright silly. Co-writer\/directors Jonathan Goldstein & John Francis Daley and co-writer Michael Gilio attempt to recreate that \u201cwe need a plan\u201d structure of the game in a script that feels like it's often making itself up as it goes along. Or pretending to do so. While that\u2019s an ambitious way to approach a fantasy film, it can make for oddly unsatisfying stretches of the final product by eliminating stakes and forcing lightheartedness. Manufactured spontaneity is almost impossible, and too much of \u201cHonor Among Thieves\u201d feels like it\u2019s unfolding with a wink and a nod instead of being legitimately rough around the edges, in-the-moment, and fresh.\n\n - [Brian Tallerico - RogerEbert.com](https:\/\/www.rogerebert.com\/reviews\/dungeons-and-dragons-honor-among-thieves-movie-review-2023)\n\n> Revelling in its own ridiculousness but finding an emotional core too, this is a wildly entertaining high-fantasy-meets-low comedy. It will leave you prancing your way out of the cinema, lute or no.\n\n - [Helen O'hara - Empire](https:\/\/www.empireonline.com\/movies\/reviews\/dungeons-dragons-honour-among-thieves\/)\n\n> It is the best Dungeons & Dragons movie we could have hoped for. Not only is it a fun fantasy movie, it\u2019s a great adaptation of a gaming session. And it\u2019s an invitation into a new and more visual version of a world dedicated players already love \u2014 and that the filmmakers seem to love, too.\n\n- [Rafael Motamayor - Polygon](https:\/\/www.polygon.com\/23635507\/dungeons-dragons-honor-among-thieves-sxsw-review-spoiler-free)\n\n> But Pine is the secret sauce that keeps this thing buoyant and fleet-footed, even when the plot turns start piling up. He\u2019s the guy at the center of this ensemble who\u2019s shining but not eclipsing everybody. More than the VFX and the grand-gesture spectacle, he\u2019s the one making this movie fun. Like vintage summer-blockbuster kind of fun. \n\n- [David Fear -  Rolling Stone](https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/tv-movies\/tv-movie-reviews\/dungeons-and-dragons-honor-among-thieves-sxsw-review-chris-pine-michelle-rodriguez-hugh-grant-1234692549\/)\n\n>  Dungeons & Dragons may have a lot going on plot-wise, but the filmmakers imbued the film with a lot of love and fun, and it shows. The film is infectiously exuberant, with kinetic energy that never lets up. Paired with its lighthearted tone, Honor Among Thieves is a wildly good time at the movies. \n\n - [Mae Abdulbaki - ScreenRant](https:\/\/screenrant.com\/dungeons-dragons-honor-among-thieves-2023-movie-review\/)","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1678521136.0},{"title":"Why did Ridley Scott\u2019s Alien Prequels failed but George Lucas Prequels succeeded?","author":"Afraid-Penalty-757","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/movies\/comments\/11qet16\/why_did_ridley_scotts_alien_prequels_failed_but\/","text":"I don\u2019t want to cover the sequel trilogy because that\u2019s done to death.

We then collected the top 65 plausible and non redundant submissions and our friends over at www.print-bingo.com made us a Bingo game card generator that has a ton of game cards for you fine folks to download.\n\n- Feel free to get however many you want for your needs but please don't waste them! \n\n- [Here is the gamecard generator.](https:\/\/print-bingo.com\/reddit\/oscars2023.php) Just do the captcha and your card will be generated via **link to a pdf.** You will have to click the link for the card, don't do the captcha a bunch of times because it's not automatically downloading. That wastes cards and each one could be a winner!\n\n- Check out [last year's game thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/movies\/comments\/tpwcq7\/oscar_bingo_game_thread_2022\/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=MovieMods&utm_content=t3_11cto9g) for reference.\n\nEveryone is welcome to participate. On Oscar Sunday we will make an official game thread for everyone to discuss their cards and the game. The game thread will also serve as a referee zone for me and participating users to make judgement calls on the more ambiguous answers. Here are some things to know about the \"competition\" side of this little shindig:\n\n- You can win.  To win, you ***MUST*** do three things.\n\n1. Take a photo or a screenshot of the winning card with the correct squares marked.\n\n2. E-mail it to an e-mail account that will be posted in the game thread.\n\n3. Make sure the **serial number** on the card is either visible or included in the e-mail along with your reddit username. This will help us verify that there's no funny business, hoopla, or any befuddling of any sort.\n\nThis is the cleanest way to do it, first three valid e-mails that meets all of that criteria win. Once the winners are validated we will update OP in the game thread.\n\n- This thread will be stickied until Oscar night when we make the game thread. There will also be an official Oscar discussion thread separate from the Bingo game thread.\n\n\nFinally, none of this ridiculousness could have been possible for such a large-scale website without print-bingo.com, and they have a message for us!\n\n*\"Print-Bingo.com is used by hundreds of teachers, event hosts, party organizers, and ex-pats in all corners of the globe to make both traditional and custom bingo cards through a web browser.

They feel like they *should* be making an impact.\n\nTo me, all three of these men are reflections of how it is to be low status in high school.\n\nSome people keep to themselves and focus solely on what they're good at (Hill).\n\nOthers keep showing up and trying to be somebody, even when they regularly get laughed out of the room (Pitt).\n\nAnd some just give up and accept their place (Hoffman).","upvote_ratio":0.46,"created_utc":1678636877.0},{"title":"The film industry should stop using Apple phones in their movies","author":"DisastrousAd4785","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/movies\/comments\/11pz926\/the_film_industry_should_stop_using_apple_phones\/","text":"The film industry should stop using Apple phones in their movies, forcing production companies not to use Apple for their villains seems stupid to me and spoils the movie, if they don't want the villains to use them, then great we're not going to use them and no one will use it, neither the bad nor the good","upvote_ratio":0.29,"created_utc":1678679353.0},{"title":"Before we start speculating\/gloating about low Oscar viewership, let\u2019s just take a moment to consider the impact of cord cutting.","author":"A_BURLAP_THONG","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/movies\/comments\/11pg4jr\/before_we_start_speculatinggloating_about_low\/","text":"The Oscars are tonight. Tomorrow, there\u2019s going to be a news story about how this year\u2019s ceremony had the steepest decline in viewership since last year\u2019s record decline. The story will rocket to the front page of \/r\/movies and people (depending on how they feel about the Oscars) will either speculate or gloat about those low viewership numbers. It's been happening like clockwork for about a decade now.  \n\n* \u201cOh, it\u2019s because the Academy isn\u2019t diverse enough and doesn\u2019t reflect viewership demographics!\u201d\n\n* \u201cNo, it\u2019s because they went woke and nobody wants to watch that!\u201d\n\n* \u201cNo, it\u2019s because they only nominate boring movies nobody has ever heard of, instead of superhero movies!\u201d\n\n* \u201cNo, it\u2019s because they try to \u2018reinvent\u2019 themselves every few years by nominating blockbusters that have no business getting Oscar nominations!\u201d\n\n* \u201cNo, it\u2019s because they pad the ceremony with songs and skits and other BS that makes it run far longer than it should!\u201d \n \nOK, so maybe *some* people consciously tuned out this year for the above reasons. But you know what else has been happening for the last decade? Cord cutting. [Across all demographics, Americans have been ditching cable in favor of streaming at a dramatic rate.](https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/fact-tank\/2021\/03\/17\/cable-and-satellite-tv-use-has-dropped-dramatically-in-the-u-s-since-2015\/) And that data is already two years old. If you look at the trendlines you can get an idea of how unpopular cable TV is these days (especially among younger demographics). Once again, [the Oscars are broadcast on ABC, along with a few live TV apps](https:\/\/www.oscars.org\/how-to-watch\/) (such as YouTube TV and Hulu Live TV\u2013which are far less common than non-live streaming services, like Netflix or regular Hulu). So if more and more people cut the cord every year, and if the Oscars refuse to air on popular streaming services, fewer and fewer people are going to watch them every year. Simple as. \n\nSo please, tomorrow when you're in that comment thread, and you\u2019re prepared to launch into some rant about capeshit or woke voters, take a moment and think. Think about the millions of people who have canceled their cable subscriptions over the years and are getting along OK without the Oscars. And if *you* didn\u2019t watch the Oscars, ask yourself: Did you do so because you were making a statement about politics or the film industry? Or did you do so because you don\u2019t have live TV and you couldn\u2019t stream it?  \n\n(And in fifteen months when the viewership numbers for the 2024 Olympics start to come in, remember this post.)","upvote_ratio":0.46,"created_utc":1678632165.0},{"title":"What was the greatest decade for movies?","author":"mugzybones","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/movies\/comments\/11p2bng\/what_was_the_greatest_decade_for_movies\/","text":"Even though the 90s features my 3 favorite movies of all time (Pulp Fiction, Trainspotting and Goodfellas), I gotta go with the 70s.

I'm at a loss for words \n\nThe protagonist is a Dollar Store Steven Seagal. He was angry the entire movie and sometimes went entire conversations without blinking in an effort to portray a stereotypical serious\/tough cop. They gave him some weird baggage about his dead daughter that contributed nothing to the plot, but was supposed to explain why he was so trigger-happy and pissed off all the time. His daughter drowned (while having a seizure?) but he was an alcoholic and feel asleep while she was swimming - marriage fell apart as a result. The same flashbacks are shown a dozen times throughout the movie. I'm not sure why that backstory would turn him a loose cannon who takes all of his cases personally, but that was their goal. \n\nSeveral of the cast members had distracting accents.

Puss in Boots was so much more profound. (Spoilers for these 2 movies and The Boys season 3)","author":"DirtyFuckingLesbian","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/movies\/comments\/11pl6ea\/may_be_an_unpopular_opinion_but_puss_in_boots_the\/","text":"Puss in Boots The Last Wish and The Whale are character studies on 2 people who have been struck down to their final moments in life, and want to make their life worth something or mean something before it runs out. Both Charlie and Puss have realised that they have been wasting their lives being selfish, and that they have been neglecting others close to them. Puss, down to his last life out of 9, and Charlie down to his final week in life, both try to make everything right after realising they're running out of time. Both of these movies are a study of mortality.\n\nThe Whale is a study of a character who's greed and selfishness leads him to because estranged from his old family. Near the time of his death, he makes a push to do right by his daughter, selflessly keeping himself away from hospital and killing himself to make sure she has money for college. The problem with The Whale is the same problem with The Boys season 3, they tell but don't show. Soldier Boy is apparently this racist, cruel superhero but the only demonstration of this is from Black Noir's animated flashback and Mother's Milk's telling of a story where he demolished their building. Soldier Boy did almost nothing wrong for what we saw of him. We were told that Charlie cheated on his wife for a student in his own english class, then didn't bat an eye for a good while, and when he did, he wasn't allowed. Whoever's fault, he did a bad thing. But for the whole entire movie, Charlie is essentially a saint who wants to see the good in his daughter despite her absolutely slagging him off at every corner. As much as i enjoyed it, after watching Puss in Boots 2022, it feels more like a display of amazing acting and sad violins rather than a proper, character built movie.\n\nPuss In Boots 2022 is a study of Puss, who's led a reckless and selfish life, generally being cocky and having disregard for others. He doesn't value life because he has 9 lives, and now he is down to his last life. After meeting a \"bounty hunter\" who turns out to be Death, blood is drawn from his head and he realises that he is, for once, scared, and instead of fighting, he runs. We see Puss' disregard and cockiness, and now we see his realisation and wake up call. Puss realises his mortality and all of his memories flash before his eyes. Puss then learns of a magic wish that can bring him back to his glory days if he asks for it, so he can go back to living this life. But Goldilocks wants this wish so she can have a real human family instead of the 3 bears, where at the end she learns that she should appreciate her family instead of the human family she had been dreaming of since she was a child. Instead of being greedy for something she wants, she can appreciate what she has. Jack Horner's original nursey rhyme advocated greed, and that's what he is here. He lets countless of his men die with no regard, and gets what he deserves at the end. Puss, at the end, faces Death and faces his fears, proving to Death that he understands his mortality and will live out his final life to it's fullest, after that dog mutt creature thing told Puss that he only needs 1 life, because he's made friends with Kitty and Puss. Puss realises that he has lived his past lives without any purpose or meaning, and vows to live this last one out with Kitty, who he left at the altar in his past life because he was afraid of making meaning to his life.\n\nCharlie has an episode related to his eating disorder and eats and eats until he throws up. His figure is more symbolic if anything and doesn't really tell any kind of story to his character apart from depression. Puss suffers from PTSD and has an anxiety attack, both from seeing Death. Every time he remembers his mortality, his heart rate spikes and his hairs prick up. Charlie kinda just eats and that's it, just for symbolism. It's more tell than show, with symbolism. His memory on the beach is just symbolism. Puss actually flicks through the meaningful parts of his life to remind him, both at the start and at the end of the movie when he meets Death. The first time, he can't find any meaningful moments to make him brave infront of death, no moments to say \"i did this and im proud, ive lived a meaningful life\" so he runs. The last time his life flashes before his eyes, he finds many moments where he connected to people as this is his last life and loses his fear of death and sets out to make a meaningful life. Charlie is a week away from death and neglects the hospital to fund his daughter. he's been dreaming of this but hasn't made an effort since he left them, and only at the last week, he makes an effort of connecting. Everytime Puss gets cocky, he sees death and gets scared. Charlie is kind of one sided, while Puss, to me, has a fleshed out character, which is ultimately way more relatable to me, way more human, which is ironic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI enjoyed The Whale, but after watching Puss in Boots The Last Wish, the one sidedness of The Whale shows a little, and it feels more like a combination of great acting and sad music mixed with symbolism instead of actual storytelling. There are no contrasts like Puss in Boots contrasts all of it's characters with, its kind of just a one sided story to me. Even before watching Puss in Boots, it felt like that but now it's way more clear.","upvote_ratio":0.32,"created_utc":1678644246.0},{"title":"As a new Dad, I am now watching children\u2019s movies.","author":"busa89","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/movies\/comments\/11ocvzu\/as_a_new_dad_i_am_now_watching_childrens_movies\/","text":"I turn 40 years old this year and I didn\u2019t have children so I hardly ever watch children\u2019s films.

To get in the spirit, I thought I would try to determine what really are the \u201cGreatest Movies of All Time.\u201d To do this I decided to turn to the internet, where all the correct opinions about movies are held. I went through four of the major movie ranking lists on the internet, representing different levels of film enthusiasm and knowledge, and found all the movies they had in common to make a list of the \u201cGreatest Movies of All Time.\u201d\n\n**If you just want to jump right in, there is a TL;DR half-way down with a link to the document.** \n\nBut if you would like a bit more detail, let me introduce the Source Lists.\n\n**The Source Lists:**\n\n\\- The IMDB Top 250: The most well-known movie ranking list with the most engagement from the general public due to the ubiquity of IMDB. Free to use and anyone\u2019s review can influence a film\u2019s ranking on this list. It is generally seen as very populist.\n\n\\- The Letterboxd Top 250: More niche than IMDB and normally used by people who are already in online film discussion circles rather than the general public. However, still free to use and anyone\u2019s review can impact a film\u2019s ranking on the list. It can be seen as an enthusiast list.\n\n\\- The Sight & Sound Critic\u2019s Top 250 (2022 Edition): Published by the British Film Institute once every decade, this list is formed by the aggregated selections of 1,639 polled film critics and scholars. Only the critics polled can affect a films placement on the list. It can be seen as a \u201cprofessional\u201d list.\n\n\\- The Sight & Sound Director\u2019s Top 100 (2022 Edition): Similar to the Critic\u2019s Top 250, the British Film Institute polled 480 directors and formed a separate aggregated list. Like the critic\u2019s version, only the directors polled can affect a film\u2019s placement on the list. This can also be seen as a \u201cprofessional\u201d list.\n\nNow that you\u2019ve been introduced to the lists that I am now all too familiar with, let me give you a brief breakdown of the document I made to show the data I collected.\n\n**The Document:** There are five(5) sheets in the document. Here is a quick summary of what is on each sheet.\n\n\\- Sheet 1: Movies on this sheet appear on all four of the lists. These are the titular \u201cGreatest Movies of All Time.\u201d Each movie\u2019s title, director, and year of release is listed. Also listed are the movies\u2019 specific placements on each list, an average placement, the best placement a movie achieves on any one list, the worst placement a movie achieves on any one list, and the difference between those two placements (\u2206). By default, the movies are ordered by their average rating.\n\n\\- Sheet 2: Due to the Sight & Sound Director\u2019s List being only a Top 100 instead of a Top 250 like the other three lists, this sheet shows the movies that appear on all four lists if every list were limited to a Top 100 like the Director\u2019s List. All data given and formatting is the same as on Sheet 1.\n\n\\- Sheet 3: Movies on this sheet appear on three of the four lists. The movies are sorted into groups with each group having a heading that says which of the three lists they were on.

The formatting is the same as Sheet 3.\n\n\\- Sheet 5: Movies on this sheet appear on only one list. The formatting is the same as Sheets 3 and 4.\n\n**TL;DR: I looked at the IMDB Top 250, the Letterboxd Top 250, The Sight and Sound Critic\u2019s Top 250, and the Sight and Sound Director\u2019s Top 100 and found every movie that was on all four lists.**\n\nNow with introductions out of the way, we can finally get to \u201cThe Great Movies of All Time.\u201d Here is the document: [https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/159DIgPbZCuNzbBl6EQT7ox2rD-aXf6GQpcZrEt7F5qY\/edit#gid=0](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/159DIgPbZCuNzbBl6EQT7ox2rD-aXf6GQpcZrEt7F5qY\/edit#gid=0)\n\n**\\*DISCLAIMER: IMDB and Letterboxd list positions are constantly updated. Certain movies might have shifted slightly from when I made this list\\***\n\n**My Observations:**\n\nThe immediate standout from looking at the \u201cGreatest Movies\u201d is that *Citizen Kane* is nowhere to be found. That is because it is not present on Letterboxd\u2019s current Top 250 at all. For fun, I calculated the average ranking of *Citizen Kane* if it was #250 on Letterboxd\u2019s list. It would have an average rating of 87.5, putting it between *Barry Lyndon* and *Ikiru*.\n\nAnother absence is any form of animation. The Director\u2019s List serves as a roadblock for three animated movies making the \u201cGreatest Movies\u201d list. *Spirited Away*, *My Neighbor Totoro*, and *Grave of the Fireflies*. If the Director\u2019s List was expanded to a Top 250, maybe all three would be on it. Or maybe most directors just aren\u2019t big fans of animation and would still leave them off. Who knows. For fun, I calculated the best possible average for *Spirited Away* (it being #101 on the theoretical expanded Director\u2019s List). It would have an average rating of 54.5, putting it between *Psycho* and *Parasite*. \n\nIn terms of diversity of films represented, I think the list is decent. Geographically speaking, many world regions are represented. But many major areas such as any sort of Chinese language film (whether it be from mainland China, Hong Kong, or Taiwan), the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa all did not make the cut. There are also no films directed by a woman or black person. (Blame IMDB for this. Unless your name is Nadine Labaki\/The Wachowski Sisters or Steve McQueen respectively, you never had a chance) \n\nAs for the movies on the list, I think it\u2019s a pretty good collection. Almost all of the films are seminal movies that have more than stood the test of time. The one outlier here is *Parasite* not only making it on all four lists, but firmly cementing itself into a very high ranking spearheaded by being the #2 ranked movie on Letterboxd. *Parasite* also survives when each list is culled to only a Top 100. Only time will tell if this movie really is an instant classic or will fall off as recency bias fades. For reference, the second newest movie after *Parasite* is *Goodfellas*, released in 1990.\n\nThe Top 2 films are head and shoulders above the other movies. *The Godfather* unsurprisingly comes in at #1 with an Average Ranking of 5.5, which is solidly in its own tier. The #2 film, *Seven Samurai*, comes in with an average ranking of 15.75. While not as high as *The Godfather*, it still is significantly higher than every other movie below it.\n\nThe most \u201cdivisive\u201d movie on the list is *Persona*. It has the largest difference between its highest placement (#9 on the Sight and Sound Director\u2019s List) and its lowest placement (#243 on the IMDB Top 250). Most \u201cdivisive\u201d movies (any movie with a \u2206 over 200) come from having a high rating from one of the Sight and Sound polls and a low rating on IMDB. However two movies, *Vertigo* and *Some Like It Hot*, have a high difference due to their low Letterboxd ranking instead. \n\nWhat do you think of the \u201dGreatest Movies of All Time\u201d? What shocking omissions are there? What unjust additions? I hope people find all of this at least somewhat as interesting as I did, and I hope it spurs someone to check out a movie they might have never considered before!","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1678530781.0},{"title":"anyone seen and really liked RENT A PAL and THEY LOOK LIKE PEOPLE ?","author":"OldLebaneseNerd","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/movies\/comments\/11p0i7l\/anyone_seen_and_really_liked_rent_a_pal_and_they\/","text":"Just asking since i almost never heard anyone ever talking about these 2 movies that i honestly think they are really good and ''out of the box'', the same can be said about 2 other movies, ''we must do something'' and btw that movie introduced me to a great song ''putting on the ritz'' and the other movie that at least got a meme made ''COME TRUE''.\n\nanw i hope in time they become cult classics, since i love these kind of movies, i really can't say if ''there is something in the dirt'' is as good, but was still a good movie.","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678581993.0},{"title":"2023 Oscars: \u2018All Quiet on the Western Front\u2019 Craft","author":"Zealousideal_Way_165","url":"https:\/\/www.hollywoodreporter.com\/movies\/movie-news\/oscars-2023-all-quiet-on-the-western-front-craft-1235347574\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1678454416.0},{"title":"I would love to see a sequel to The Sixth Sense that follows an adult Cole as a realized medium","author":"quinnly","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/movies\/comments\/11nvk49\/i_would_love_to_see_a_sequel_to_the_sixth_sense\/","text":"I've had this idea in my head for a while now and I wonder if anyone else would appreciate something like this.\n\nIt could even have a classic M Night twist.

This is one hell of a divisive movie and I am very much on the side of thinking it's not good. I never expected to revisit it given it's the most disturbing movie I've ever seen, but I wanted to be proven wrong about the intense hatred I've felt towards it since my first watch in mid 2021, so I finally worked up the courage and decided to go into this a second time with a more positive mindset. Figured that knowing what to expect might change my perspective. But while it certainly softened the blow and helped me see it in a different way, I don't think it helped really; I may not viscerally detest it this time, but this is still going to mostly be addressing all the same issues I had before.\n\nBut first, some pros. Yes, the long takes are impressive and the acting is fantastic. The long takes in particular are part of the many techniques that I think are very well-utilised to add to the atmosphere, especially in the Rectum scene; others include the perfect choice of background club music, the slight but noticeable alterations in the neverending droning noise, the flickering light effects, and the use of classical music in the final scene, along with the one dizzying camera movement I don't think is dumb. Also there's some ways the camera transitions between sets near the beginning which I think is cool.\n\nAnd now the cons.\n\nUnfortunately, a lot of the problems I had with the movie before still ring true. For one, if you asked me to point to a filmmaker who gives off a 'not like other girls' vibe in their directing style, it would be Gaspar Noe. The difference between someone like Robert Eggers and him is that every signature stylistic choice by Robert Eggers adds something to the atmosphere, but that is not the case here. As soon as I saw the opening credits doing one of Noe's schticks of triggering seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy (see also: Enter the Void and Lux Aeterna), and then proceeding to rotate for no reason at all, I was reminded that this film likes to do a lot of things seemingly for the sake of it, if not just for the attention. He really likes his spinning cameras here.\n\nAnother thing Noe really likes is studying human depravity. I mean, that's the point of this film, right? Well, when you make almost every character in every scene a scumbag and add a bunch of extra depravity unrelated to the main topic at hand I find it kinda defeats the point a little. As a recent comparison, take The Whale - I did eventually think it was very good, but for a while I was alienated by the fact that it opened with masturbation and the fact that Ellie is written to be so goddamn awful. This is that cranked up to 11. It's not even just that the rape scene is so gratuitious in its own right, because that even I could justify as helping to get the point across in the most brutal way; it's that the movie is focused less on the point and more on the explicitness (of everything in the movie, not just the rape itself). Stuff like the fact that he throws in a detail about Alex being pregnant just to make it an extra extreme case, all the slurs thrown into the dialogue, the trans character and the asian character thrown into the script so that more marginalised groups can be harassed by the main characters, the fact that The Tenia is a pimp in a gay club, the fact that it's called the Rectum, the fact that the people in it are depraved enough to beg a stranger to fist them.\n\nFor the record, Noe has stated that his proof of the depiction of gay people in the movie not being homophobic is the fact that he cameos in the scene jacking off to show that he's not above them, which just suggests to me that he's saying 'gay people are depraved and I am too', which isn't much of a defense. At best his cameo there is further evidence of his lack of focus of the topic the film is meant to be about, which leads to another major flaw pointed out by a few other people; this is a woman's story of becoming a victim as told from the perspective of a man, which is not the way to do it.\n\nI'm not sure if Noe was aware of these points when making this, because he may have not made it with the intention of it being focused on the rape, but if he didn't make it with that intention then that's just misguided, and if he did then he failed. The fact of the matter is that no matter how thought-provoking this film is on the topic of the severity of rape, the film is so unfocused on that topic that you cannot convince me Noe's intention was that specifically, and not just to shock the audience, and hence this is definitely not the right medium to get the point across.\n\nAnd just a few nitpicks while I'm at it:\n\n-Marcus really has no reason to be sex-craved other than, again, to soullessly up the explicit factor. Enter the Void is the Noe movie I dislike the least due to its fascinating premise and initially decent execution, but even that movie got bogged down in uneccessary extra sex and extended sequences of flashing lights that add nothing. Noe just can't help himself, and it's sad.\n\n-A lot of time in the party scene is dedicated to showing Pierre caring for Alex and trying to get Marcus to stop being dickish, which makes it confusing when he starts randomly acting weird when Alex is about to leave. The movie does a poor job of convincing me that he isn't the type to catch up with her and offer to walk her home, which given she knows him, I'm pretty sure she'd be fine with. Considering this is such a pivotal moment in the film's events it bothers me that I'm not very convinced by it.\n\nSo yeah, that's my rant over. It wasn't a passionate rant like I've had so many times before with this movie, but I still just think this is a bit of a shitshow. Sorry Noe fans, but I will never understand you.","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678545714.0},{"title":"Documentaries with plot twists","author":"Wintertime13","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/movies\/comments\/11o5vhw\/documentaries_with_plot_twists\/","text":"Watched Three Identical Strangers last night and was obsessed.

And I\u2019m the main universe, the entire building was destroyed. It would be weird if they acted like nothing happened after that. \n\nDo you think there is an answer? Or maybe this is a plot hole and it is the main universe and everything is just magically fixed.\n\nEdit: some people are saying \u201ceverywhere\u201d or \u201cevery universe\u201d as an answer so I want to clear up my question, unless everyone is just trying to be sarcastic. I want to know in what universe do you guys think the last scene was set in. Yes I know the mom and daughter are everywhere, but we only see one place in the last scene of the movie. Which universe is that?\n\nAlso, for everyone saying that it is the original universe, can you then explain how everything went back to normal? The movie days that they went back to do taxes only a few days later. On top of that in the universe where it started, the tax lady called the police on the mom for punching her, and there was no indication that they made up. So, to me it would illogical to think that they. But please try to explain it to me I\u2019m trying to be open to the idea, it\u2019s just hard for me to logically understand without plot holes.\n\nEdit: if I may make my own verdict after reading all of your helpful comments it is this: it\u2019s COMPLETELY up for interpretation and opinion. It all depends on what you count as the \u201coriginal\u201d universe. It seems have figured out that the story does in fact end in the Chinese new year party universe. Here is where it gets tricky. At the beginning of the movie, when Evelyn had a choice of punching the tax lady, that is when the first universe split. So, one where she punches her and that\u2019s where the film mainly focuses, or another universe where they go home and never did their taxes and the tax lady showed up at her party. So it really is entirely opinion of what is the original. In essence, since they are both branches, I think technically neither of them are \u201coriginal\u201d time lines. But for a very basic answer, she stays in the universe of the Chinese new year party, not the destroyed building universe.","upvote_ratio":0.63,"created_utc":1678473983.0},{"title":"Roger Deakins Breaks Down His Most Iconic Films","author":"pierodipuppa","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=CZ76u0WHXXI","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.55,"created_utc":1678527270.0},{"title":"Where to watch the Oscar nominated shorts?","author":"Maxmond","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/movies\/comments\/11ojzln\/where_to_watch_the_oscar_nominated_shorts\/","text":"Where can I watch the films nominated for this years documentary short, live action short, and animated shorts categories? \n\nI've already watched \"The Elephant Whisperes\" on Netflix, and a local cinema is showing the live action shorts, but I don't really know where to look for the other shorts.

It had the easiest time of the films I\u2019ve seen, and handled it the best.\n\nThe other films I\u2019ve seen which had to recast (or deal with the death of a principle character) would include Harry Potter, Fantastic Beasts, Star Wars, and Hunger Games. \n\nHunger Games ranks 2nd. I haven\u2019t read the books, but I thought the films handled the death of Philip Seymour Hoffman\u2019s character quite well. \n\nHarry Potter would rank 3rd. Richard Harris felt like the perfect Dumbledore, but Michael Gambon did a fine enough job, and the thing fans dislike him for the most was certainly a result of the directors and not him. Gambon portrayed a fairly aggressive Dumbledore in Goblet of Fire, but it was up to the director to reign this in (assuming he didn\u2019t direct Gambon to act that way in the first place). Gambon was far more faithful to Dumbledore in Half Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows, meaning a great Dumbledore performance was entirely possible in the other films.\n\nLeia was not recast in The Rise of Skywalker, but the story was rewritten after her death and archival footage utilized to maintain some semblance of continuity. JJ was dealt a shit hand with Carrie\u2019s death, and I have no doubt Rise would\u2019ve been better if she was still around. But I don\u2019t think the problems with Rise can be entirely blamed on Carrie\u2019s death, so at the end of the day it still would\u2019ve been a bad film - just not as bad if Carrie was still around. \n\nI rank Fantastic Beasts last because this recasting was entirely self-inflicted. Johnny Depp did not die between Crimes of Grindelwald and Secrets of Dumbledore. Warner made the decision to axe him from the franchise due to outside controversy. I never truly got over the recasting, even as I recognized that Mads Mikkelson was probably the better choice for Grindelwald from the outset. It does not alleviate Secret of Dumbledore from the conundrum of recasting a major character despite the original actor not dying.","upvote_ratio":0.53,"created_utc":1678521861.0},{"title":"how bad is that one hereditary scene? spoilers!","author":"New_Assumption2984","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/movies\/comments\/11omxgv\/how_bad_is_that_one_hereditary_scene_spoilers\/","text":"since i\u2019ve written my previous post, i\u2019ve decided i want to watch the movie. there\u2019s just one more scene i\u2019m not sure i can watch, and i want people to relay to me how bad it is to see if i can handle it.\n\ni know everything about the movie, as much as i can know without watching it anyway, so don\u2019t be afraid to spoil it! \n\nso, that one scene when annie chases peter to the attic, bangs her head on the door, and decapitates herself with piano wire, how bad\/gory\/scary is it? i\u2019ve seen the other clips of charlie\u2019s head, the decapitated bodies, etc and was fine. it was kinda midsommar-esque so i wasn\u2019t bothered. but i\u2019m not sure if i can handle watching her bang her head on the door, much less decapitate herself.\n\nis it gory and graphic? that\u2019s the thing i\u2019m most scared of. any opinions would be appreciated!","upvote_ratio":0.41,"created_utc":1678548563.0},{"title":"In honor of the Academy Award weekend, what is a line from an Oscar winning movie, that you find yourself saying (or thinking) on a regular basis?","author":"Ppppool","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/movies\/comments\/11omlip\/in_honor_of_the_academy_award_weekend_what_is_a\/","text":"When I get out of the shower, and remoisturize the skin, or see a friend using lotion, I tend to recite the classic line from the 1991 thriller, Silence of the Lambs.\n\n\"It puts the lotion on its skin, or else it gets the hose again.\"\n\nGreat movie.

I'm very thankful for the constructive and instructive feedback. I wrote this shortly after seeing Tar, but now that some time has passed, reflecting differently on it... and I'm going to watch it again. Knowing how it ends doesn't matter.

It\u2019s about Lydia Tar, \u201ca renowned celebrity conductor who is embroiled in a career-ending scandal over accusations of serial sexual harassment and abuse.\u201d\n\nIt is a mixture of curiosity, musical artistry, and in my opinion, abject failure.\n\nIt starts out with an interview of Lydia Tar being conducted by a journalist, a real one from The New Yorker. It\u2019s long. And for a time, you start to think\u2026 is this a movie, or some kind of documentary? After about 8 to 10 minutes, finally\u2026 the interview is over and the movie kicks in. For 3 hours.\n\nLydia is this amazingly talented conductor, but she\u2019s also an arrogant b\\*tch. She\u2019s living a life of privilege in Europe, after a rather miserable early childhood in America. In fact, she distanced herself from that past by changing her name (her real name is Linda Tarr). But she\u2019s easily bitter, aloof, and seems to end up making a lot of people around her frustrated and miserable.\n\nThe pace of the movie is lopsided. It\u2019s extremely slow at times, dwelling on mundane things or taking way too long to get personality aspects across. Other times, it picks up the pace, but then abruptly cuts scenes leaving you guessing as to what happened. And in some cases, they\u2019re never revisited\u2026 we never know what truly happened.\n\nThe movie is all about the downward spiral of egotistical Lydia Tar. There\u2019s no love lost. You never really grow to like her. In fact, there\u2019s really no one in this movie to identify with and appreciate, because they\u2019re all so transient.\n\nAlso, the musical aspect is complex. There\u2019s many references to aspects of classical music compositions and conducting that use high level references most people won\u2019t get at all. I studied classical music piano for 11 years and I was lost.\n\nI am totally mystified why this movie got such a high rating on Rotten Tomatoes and garnered Academy Awards nominations, beyond Blanchett. Cate is in her best form, in terms of role emersion and tremendous characterization. She worked brilliantly hard on this. You can tell. She learned piano pieces and how to conduct an orchestra. She has a good chance of winning Best Actor, ~~but I really hope she doesn\u2019t\u2026 the movie just wasn\u2019t worth it all.

Set in Manhattan, which means suspension of disbelief is going to be working overtime, and the killer can dodge shotgun blasts at point blank range and move throughout the city undetected and has a secret layer with the outfit in a glass case. GHOSTFACE ISN'T FUCKING BATMAN YOU IDIOTS!!!!! Ghostface isn't supposed to be an unstoppable commando, it's supposed to be a psychotic kid\/serial killer enthusiast.

It's a similar situation to the Terminator and Alien franchises where those two both should've ended after their second films, and Scream should've been done after the original trilogy. I did enjoy the spinoff series though, and Scream 4 was at least passable.","upvote_ratio":0.35,"created_utc":1678518303.0},{"title":"4 anonymous Oscars voters reveal brutally honest secret ballot picks for the Academy Awards","author":"Owasso_Landman","url":"https:\/\/ew.com\/awards\/oscars\/2023-oscars-secret-ballot-academy-awards-voters-share-juicy-picks\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678461525.0},{"title":"How \u2018Spirited Away\u2019s\u2019 Oscar Win Exposed the Academy","author":"ahydell","url":"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/tv-movies\/tv-movie-features\/spirited-away-oscar-best-animated-feature-hayao-miyazaki-america-first-bias-iraq-war-1234691090\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.62,"created_utc":1678406270.0},{"title":"Chaim Topol, Known Worldwide for His Role in 'Fiddler on the Roof,' Dies at 87","author":"Wouldyoulistenmoe","url":"https:\/\/www.haaretz.com\/israel-news\/2023-03-09\/ty-article\/.premium\/chaim-topol-known-worldwide-for-his-role-in-fiddler-on-the-roof-dies-at-87\/00000186-c1b4-db8c-a1be-d5f6ac390000","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1678338057.0},{"title":"Official poster for 'The Last Kingdom' sequel film 'Seven Kings Must Die'","author":"DemiFiendRSA","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/aozlapywjjma1.jpg","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1678292939.0},{"title":"What movie that is well known in popular culture have you not actually watched?","author":"Sam_English821","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/movies\/comments\/11nudwc\/what_movie_that_is_well_known_in_popular_culture\/","text":"So it occurred to me that even though it is referenced many times in my favorite episode of my favorite TV show (Supernatural, Mystery Spot) and I enjoy the trope of time loops immensely (ie: Edge of Tomorrow).

Come get a Bingo card and join us in the fun on Sunday during the Oscars!","author":"LiteraryBoner","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/movies\/comments\/11ofg3n\/official_oscar_bingo_year_x_2023_card_pickup\/","text":"Alright everyone, Oscar Sunday is quickly approaching and with it the growing anticipation to simultaneously be enthralled and disappointed by the glamour and politics of Hollywood. Well, to make it all a little more interesting we are doing Oscar Bingo again this year. A week ago we [asked you guys to come up with things that might happen at the Oscars](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MovieMods\/comments\/11cto9g\/official_oscar_bingo_submission_thread_2023\/) and vote for your favorites. We then collected the top 65 plausible and non redundant submissions and our friends over at www.print-bingo.com made us a Bingo game card generator that has a ton of game cards for you fine folks to download.\n\n- Feel free to get however many you want for your needs but please don't waste them! \n\n- [Here is the gamecard generator.](https:\/\/print-bingo.com\/reddit\/oscars2023.php) Just do the captcha and your card will be generated via **link to a pdf.** You will have to click the link for the card, don't do the captcha a bunch of times because it's not automatically downloading. That wastes cards and each one could be a winner!\n\n- Check out [last year's game thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/movies\/comments\/tpwcq7\/oscar_bingo_game_thread_2022\/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=MovieMods&utm_content=t3_11cto9g) for reference.\n\nEveryone is welcome to participate. On Oscar Sunday we will make an official game thread for everyone to discuss their cards and the game. The game thread will also serve as a referee zone for me and participating users to make judgement calls on the more ambiguous answers. Here are some things to know about the \"competition\" side of this little shindig:\n\n- You can win.  To win, you ***MUST*** do three things.\n\n1. Take a photo or a screenshot of the winning card with the correct squares marked.\n\n2. E-mail it to an e-mail account that will be posted in the game thread.\n\n3. Make sure the **serial number** on the card is either visible or included in the e-mail along with your reddit username. This will help us verify that there's no funny business, hoopla, or any befuddling of any sort.\n\nThis is the cleanest way to do it, first three valid e-mails that meets all of that criteria win. Once the winners are validated we will update OP in the game thread.\n\n- This thread will be stickied until Oscar night when we make the game thread. There will also be an official Oscar discussion thread separate from the Bingo game thread.\n\n\nFinally, none of this ridiculousness could have been possible for such a large-scale website without print-bingo.com, and they have a message for us!\n\n*\"Print-Bingo.com is used by hundreds of teachers, event hosts, party organizers, and ex-pats in all corners of the globe to make both traditional and custom bingo cards through a web browser. We are happy to help Reddit with this fun, specialized, use of our website.\"*\n\nSo hey! Pick up a gamecard. Pick up 5. Play with your friends. Play alone with your cat. And let this be a reminder to all of us not to take the Oscars too seriously.","upvote_ratio":0.68,"created_utc":1678525518.0},{"title":"I wrote \u201cOscar Wars,\u201d a new book about a century of scandals and controversies at the Academy Awards\u2014AMA about the Oscars then or now!","author":"MichaelSchulman","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/movies\/comments\/11op3fe\/i_wrote_oscar_wars_a_new_book_about_a_century_of\/","text":"I\u2019m Michael Schulman, a staff writer at The New Yorker covering arts, culture, and celebrity.

There\u2019s what actually happened (which is impossible for her to piece together), there\u2019s what happened as captured on video (which is a good but imperfect way to piece things together), and there\u2019s what happened as captured by her memory (her mind video recorder, or whatever Young Sophie calls it once her dad shuts off the actual recorder).\n\nProbably making something out of nothing here, but thought it would be interesting to see if anyone agrees\/disagrees with it.","upvote_ratio":0.74,"created_utc":1678559132.0},{"title":"Andrea Iervolino to Produce Maserati Origins Movie","author":"Bennett1984","url":"https:\/\/variety.com\/2023\/film\/global\/maserati-biopic-in-motion-from-producer-andrea-iervolino-lamborghini-ferrari-1235546526\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.69,"created_utc":1678558769.0},{"title":"90s movies today.

To get in the spirit, I thought I would try to determine what really are the \u201cGreatest Movies of All Time.\u201d To do this I decided to turn to the internet, where all the correct opinions about movies are held. I went through four of the major movie ranking lists on the internet, representing different levels of film enthusiasm and knowledge, and found all the movies they had in common to make a list of the \u201cGreatest Movies of All Time.\u201d\n\n**If you just want to jump right in, there is a TL;DR half-way down with a link to the document.** \n\nBut if you would like a bit more detail, let me introduce the Source Lists.\n\n**The Source Lists:**\n\n\\- The IMDB Top 250: The most well-known movie ranking list with the most engagement from the general public due to the ubiquity of IMDB. Free to use and anyone\u2019s review can influence a film\u2019s ranking on this list. It is generally seen as very populist.\n\n\\- The Letterboxd Top 250: More niche than IMDB and normally used by people who are already in online film discussion circles rather than the general public. However, still free to use and anyone\u2019s review can impact a film\u2019s ranking on the list. It can be seen as an enthusiast list.\n\n\\- The Sight & Sound Critic\u2019s Top 250 (2022 Edition): Published by the British Film Institute once every decade, this list is formed by the aggregated selections of 1,639 polled film critics and scholars. Only the critics polled can affect a films placement on the list. It can be seen as a \u201cprofessional\u201d list.\n\n\\- The Sight & Sound Director\u2019s Top 100 (2022 Edition): Similar to the Critic\u2019s Top 250, the British Film Institute polled 480 directors and formed a separate aggregated list. Like the critic\u2019s version, only the directors polled can affect a film\u2019s placement on the list. This can also be seen as a \u201cprofessional\u201d list.\n\nNow that you\u2019ve been introduced to the lists that I am now all too familiar with, let me give you a brief breakdown of the document I made to show the data I collected.\n\n**The Document:** There are five(5) sheets in the document. Here is a quick summary of what is on each sheet.\n\n\\- Sheet 1: Movies on this sheet appear on all four of the lists. These are the titular \u201cGreatest Movies of All Time.\u201d Each movie\u2019s title, director, and year of release is listed. Also listed are the movies\u2019 specific placements on each list, an average placement, the best placement a movie achieves on any one list, the worst placement a movie achieves on any one list, and the difference between those two placements (\u2206). By default, the movies are ordered by their average rating.\n\n\\- Sheet 2: Due to the Sight & Sound Director\u2019s List being only a Top 100 instead of a Top 250 like the other three lists, this sheet shows the movies that appear on all four lists if every list were limited to a Top 100 like the Director\u2019s List. All data given and formatting is the same as on Sheet 1.\n\n\\- Sheet 3: Movies on this sheet appear on three of the four lists. The movies are sorted into groups with each group having a heading that says which of the three lists they were on. Within the groups, the films are sorted alphabetically (NOT BY PLACEMENT).\n\n\\- Sheet 4: Movies on this sheet appear on two of the four lists. The formatting is the same as Sheet 3.\n\n\\- Sheet 5: Movies on this sheet appear on only one list. The formatting is the same as Sheets 3 and 4.\n\n**TL;DR: I looked at the IMDB Top 250, the Letterboxd Top 250, The Sight and Sound Critic\u2019s Top 250, and the Sight and Sound Director\u2019s Top 100 and found every movie that was on all four lists.**\n\nNow with introductions out of the way, we can finally get to \u201cThe Great Movies of All Time.\u201d Here is the document: [https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/159DIgPbZCuNzbBl6EQT7ox2rD-aXf6GQpcZrEt7F5qY\/edit#gid=0](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/159DIgPbZCuNzbBl6EQT7ox2rD-aXf6GQpcZrEt7F5qY\/edit#gid=0)\n\n**\\*DISCLAIMER: IMDB and Letterboxd list positions are constantly updated. Certain movies might have shifted slightly from when I made this list\\***\n\n**My Observations:**\n\nThe immediate standout from looking at the \u201cGreatest Movies\u201d is that *Citizen Kane* is nowhere to be found. That is because it is not present on Letterboxd\u2019s current Top 250 at all. For fun, I calculated the average ranking of *Citizen Kane* if it was #250 on Letterboxd\u2019s list. It would have an average rating of 87.5, putting it between *Barry Lyndon* and *Ikiru*.\n\nAnother absence is any form of animation. The Director\u2019s List serves as a roadblock for three animated movies making the \u201cGreatest Movies\u201d list. *Spirited Away*, *My Neighbor Totoro*, and *Grave of the Fireflies*. If the Director\u2019s List was expanded to a Top 250, maybe all three would be on it. Or maybe most directors just aren\u2019t big fans of animation and would still leave them off. Who knows. For fun, I calculated the best possible average for *Spirited Away* (it being #101 on the theoretical expanded Director\u2019s List). It would have an average rating of 54.5, putting it between *Psycho* and *Parasite*. \n\nIn terms of diversity of films represented, I think the list is decent. Geographically speaking, many world regions are represented. But many major areas such as any sort of Chinese language film (whether it be from mainland China, Hong Kong, or Taiwan), the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa all did not make the cut. There are also no films directed by a woman or black person. (Blame IMDB for this. Unless your name is Nadine Labaki\/The Wachowski Sisters or Steve McQueen respectively, you never had a chance) \n\nAs for the movies on the list, I think it\u2019s a pretty good collection. Almost all of the films are seminal movies that have more than stood the test of time. The one outlier here is *Parasite* not only making it on all four lists, but firmly cementing itself into a very high ranking spearheaded by being the #2 ranked movie on Letterboxd. *Parasite* also survives when each list is culled to only a Top 100. Only time will tell if this movie really is an instant classic or will fall off as recency bias fades. For reference, the second newest movie after *Parasite* is *Goodfellas*, released in 1990.\n\nThe Top 2 films are head and shoulders above the other movies. *The Godfather* unsurprisingly comes in at #1 with an Average Ranking of 5.5, which is solidly in its own tier. The #2 film, *Seven Samurai*, comes in with an average ranking of 15.75. While not as high as *The Godfather*, it still is significantly higher than every other movie below it.\n\nThe most \u201cdivisive\u201d movie on the list is *Persona*. It has the largest difference between its highest placement (#9 on the Sight and Sound Director\u2019s List) and its lowest placement (#243 on the IMDB Top 250). Most \u201cdivisive\u201d movies (any movie with a \u2206 over 200) come from having a high rating from one of the Sight and Sound polls and a low rating on IMDB. However two movies, *Vertigo* and *Some Like It Hot*, have a high difference due to their low Letterboxd ranking instead. \n\nWhat do you think of the \u201dGreatest Movies of All Time\u201d? What shocking omissions are there? What unjust additions? I hope people find all of this at least somewhat as interesting as I did, and I hope it spurs someone to check out a movie they might have never considered before!","upvote_ratio":0.59,"created_utc":1678530781.0},{"title":"I would love to see a sequel to The Sixth Sense that follows an adult Cole as a realized medium","author":"quinnly","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/movies\/comments\/11nvk49\/i_would_love_to_see_a_sequel_to_the_sixth_sense\/","text":"I've had this idea in my head for a while now and I wonder if anyone else would appreciate something like this.\n\nIt could even have a classic M Night twist.

One of the worst movies I've ever seen lol. It's something you might expect from a high school film enthusiast trying his hand at directing... I'm at a loss for words \n\nThe protagonist is a Dollar Store Steven Seagal. He was angry the entire movie and sometimes went entire conversations without blinking in an effort to portray a stereotypical serious\/tough cop. They gave him some weird baggage about his dead daughter that contributed nothing to the plot, but was supposed to explain why he was so trigger-happy and pissed off all the time. His daughter drowned (while having a seizure?) but he was an alcoholic and feel asleep while she was swimming - marriage fell apart as a result. The same flashbacks are shown a dozen times throughout the movie. I'm not sure why that backstory would turn him a loose cannon who takes all of his cases personally, but that was their goal. \n\nSeveral of the cast members had distracting accents. This may sound like a weird complaint, but it threw me off. The film is based in Mississippi and the Captain at the police department (who was entirely useless and added nothing to the plot) was going for a Southern US accent but clearly sounded Scandinavian. \n\nThe entire cast seemingly had 0 acting experience aside from Morgan Freeman.

Pixar and DreamWorks especially\u2026 every character used to be perfectly cast. Toy Story, Monsters, inc. Finding Nemo, Incredibles, Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, HTTYD, Cars\u2026 \n\nNowadays it just feels like they hire any big A name celebrity they can think of that\u2019s in Marvel movies right now (Chris Pratt, Tom Holland, Chris Evans all did recent Pixar movies and Tom Holland was an okay match the others didn\u2019t fit the character very well IMO). Or they cast some cliche actor who\u2019s done a ton of animated voice work for big characters already, like Seth Rogen or Jack Black.\n\nThe Mario movie for instance looks great but the voice casting seems so lazy to me. Obviously there\u2019s Pratt as Mario which has been talked about plenty, but even Bowser\u2026 I love Jack Black but make Bowser more menacing, it\u2019s okay for animated films to have actually menacing villains and not just try to make everyone funny\u2026 bowser should feel more threatening and have a deeper scarier voice\u2026 not Jack Black just trying to make his voice deep.\n\nAnd Donkey Kong\u2026 Seth rogen just doesn\u2019t fit him at all.\n\nJack Black was Kung Fu Panda and Rogen was mantis in that movie. Rogen was also B.o.B. In Monsters V Aliens and Pumba in The Lion King remake and all characters just sound the same and idk.\n\nEven Puss in Boots 2, which was great, had John Mulaney as Jack Horner, and he was just Spider-Ham in Into the Spiderverse.\n\nI know there\u2019s people whose entire profession is voice acting and they do multiple cartoon characters. I just feel like with movies it\u2019s a bigger deal and you should try to put a bit more thought into it other than \u201coh this guy did the voice of that character in that other poplar animated movie, let\u2019s have him do this\u201d\n\nI mean why is Chris Pratt playing so many animated characters? His voice is alright \n\nIt just feels to me like animated movies used really take pride in their casting and really assign the role to the exact right person to the point where I\u2019m literally like\u2026 yeah that is that characters voice\u2026 I can\u2019t see it any other way\u2026 this was meant to be\u2026\n\nInstead when I see Donkey Kong and hear Seth Rogen\u2019s voice\u2026 it just makes me think of Seth Rogen in a recording studio.

This is one hell of a divisive movie and I am very much on the side of thinking it's not good. I never expected to revisit it given it's the most disturbing movie I've ever seen, but I wanted to be proven wrong about the intense hatred I've felt towards it since my first watch in mid 2021, so I finally worked up the courage and decided to go into this a second time with a more positive mindset. Figured that knowing what to expect might change my perspective. But while it certainly softened the blow and helped me see it in a different way, I don't think it helped really; I may not viscerally detest it this time, but this is still going to mostly be addressing all the same issues I had before.\n\nBut first, some pros. Yes, the long takes are impressive and the acting is fantastic. The long takes in particular are part of the many techniques that I think are very well-utilised to add to the atmosphere, especially in the Rectum scene; others include the perfect choice of background club music, the slight but noticeable alterations in the neverending droning noise, the flickering light effects, and the use of classical music in the final scene, along with the one dizzying camera movement I don't think is dumb. Also there's some ways the camera transitions between sets near the beginning which I think is cool.\n\nAnd now the cons.\n\nUnfortunately, a lot of the problems I had with the movie before still ring true. For one, if you asked me to point to a filmmaker who gives off a 'not like other girls' vibe in their directing style, it would be Gaspar Noe. The difference between someone like Robert Eggers and him is that every signature stylistic choice by Robert Eggers adds something to the atmosphere, but that is not the case here. As soon as I saw the opening credits doing one of Noe's schticks of triggering seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy (see also: Enter the Void and Lux Aeterna), and then proceeding to rotate for no reason at all, I was reminded that this film likes to do a lot of things seemingly for the sake of it, if not just for the attention. He really likes his spinning cameras here.\n\nAnother thing Noe really likes is studying human depravity. I mean, that's the point of this film, right? Well, when you make almost every character in every scene a scumbag and add a bunch of extra depravity unrelated to the main topic at hand I find it kinda defeats the point a little. As a recent comparison, take The Whale - I did eventually think it was very good, but for a while I was alienated by the fact that it opened with masturbation and the fact that Ellie is written to be so goddamn awful. This is that cranked up to 11. It's not even just that the rape scene is so gratuitious in its own right, because that even I could justify as helping to get the point across in the most brutal way; it's that the movie is focused less on the point and more on the explicitness (of everything in the movie, not just the rape itself). Stuff like the fact that he throws in a detail about Alex being pregnant just to make it an extra extreme case, all the slurs thrown into the dialogue, the trans character and the asian character thrown into the script so that more marginalised groups can be harassed by the main characters, the fact that The Tenia is a pimp in a gay club, the fact that it's called the Rectum, the fact that the people in it are depraved enough to beg a stranger to fist them.\n\nFor the record, Noe has stated that his proof of the depiction of gay people in the movie not being homophobic is the fact that he cameos in the scene jacking off to show that he's not above them, which just suggests to me that he's saying 'gay people are depraved and I am too', which isn't much of a defense. At best his cameo there is further evidence of his lack of focus of the topic the film is meant to be about, which leads to another major flaw pointed out by a few other people; this is a woman's story of becoming a victim as told from the perspective of a man, which is not the way to do it.\n\nI'm not sure if Noe was aware of these points when making this, because he may have not made it with the intention of it being focused on the rape, but if he didn't make it with that intention then that's just misguided, and if he did then he failed. The fact of the matter is that no matter how thought-provoking this film is on the topic of the severity of rape, the film is so unfocused on that topic that you cannot convince me Noe's intention was that specifically, and not just to shock the audience, and hence this is definitely not the right medium to get the point across.\n\nAnd just a few nitpicks while I'm at it:\n-Marcus really has no reason to be sex-craved other than, again, to soullessly up the explicit factor. Enter the Void is the Noe movie I dislike the least due to its fascinating premise and initially decent execution, but even that movie got bogged down in uneccessary extra sex and extended sequences of flashing lights that add nothing. Noe just can't help himself, and it's sad.\n-A lot of time in the party scene is dedicated to showing Pierre caring for Alex and trying to get Marcus to stop being dickish, which makes it confusing when he starts randomly acting weird when Alex is about to leave. The movie does a poor job of convincing me that he isn't the type to catch up with her and offer to walk her home, which given she knows him, I'm pretty sure she'd be fine with. Considering this is such a pivotal moment in the film's events it bothers me that I'm not very convinced by it.\n\nSo yeah, that's my rant over. It wasn't a passionate rant like I've had so many times before with this movie, but I still just think this is a bit of a shitshow. Sorry Noe fans, but I will never understand you.","upvote_ratio":0.48,"created_utc":1678545714.0},{"title":"Documentaries with plot twists","author":"Wintertime13","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/movies\/comments\/11o5vhw\/documentaries_with_plot_twists\/","text":"Watched Three Identical Strangers last night and was obsessed.

And I\u2019m the main universe, the entire building was destroyed. It would be weird if they acted like nothing happened after that. \n\nDo you think there is an answer? Or maybe this is a plot hole and it is the main universe and everything is just magically fixed.\n\nEdit: some people are saying \u201ceverywhere\u201d or \u201cevery universe\u201d as an answer so I want to clear up my question, unless everyone is just trying to be sarcastic. I want to know in what universe do you guys think the last scene was set in. Yes I know the mom and daughter are everywhere, but we only see one place in the last scene of the movie. Which universe is that?\n\nAlso, for everyone saying that it is the original universe, can you then explain how everything went back to normal? The movie days that they went back to do taxes only a few days later. On top of that in the universe where it started, the tax lady called the police on the mom for punching her, and there was no indication that they made up. So, to me it would illogical to think that they. But please try to explain it to me I\u2019m trying to be open to the idea, it\u2019s just hard for me to logically understand without plot holes.\n\nEdit: if I may make my own verdict after reading all of your helpful comments it is this: it\u2019s COMPLETELY up for interpretation and opinion. It all depends on what you count as the \u201coriginal\u201d universe. It seems have figured out that the story does in fact end in the Chinese new year party universe. Here is where it gets tricky. At the beginning of the movie, when Evelyn had a choice of punching the tax lady, that is when the first universe split. So, one where she punches her and that\u2019s where the film mainly focuses, or another universe where they go home and never did their taxes and the tax lady showed up at her party. So it really is entirely opinion of what is the original. In essence, since they are both branches, I think technically neither of them are \u201coriginal\u201d time lines. But for a very basic answer, she stays in the universe of the Chinese new year party, not the destroyed building universe.","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1678473983.0},{"title":"Any good movies starring Til Schweiger?","author":"lukoreta","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/movies\/comments\/11oi9hk\/any_good_movies_starring_til_schweiger\/","text":"I just watched Knockin On Heaven's Door and man, that was great.

Don't get me wrong. I don't remember last time a movie really scared me. This one did. I love Hereditary and think it is a very disturbing movie, but even that didn't scare me or disturbed me - all because I knew it was a horror movie and was prepared. When watching Hereditary, I appreciated the movie. When watching Missing, I felt the movie.\n\nIt has some funny elements in it. They were maybe not so well done (idk) but because I knew nothing about the movie, they caught me off-guard and I found myself laughing alot (scared and laughing, don't seem a possible combination, but this movie did it).\n\nShortly, it was the best experience ever, only because I knew nothing. After I watched the movie, I watched the trailer and also found out it was a sequel to Searching (2020). Thanks god, I didn't know that before.\n\nEven though the trailer doesn't really reveal major plot points, it actually does ruin experience. For example, Kevin Lin being a suspect (HAD NO IDEA DURING THE MOVIE AND WAS SHOCKED), the mother being a suspect (SHOCKED ME EVEN MORE) and so on. There are many scenes in the trailer that would just sit in the back of my head and made me prepared for all the shock points.\n\nI am looking forward to Beau is Afraid but unfortunately, I know it will be a good movie and that ruins it for me. I know Ari Aster and I have watched the trailer. Maybe, even though it had a better potential of fucking up with me, it wont fuck me up as much as Missing, only because I know more.\n\nWho agrees with this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: thank you for your opinion guys!\n\nedit: damn this blew up.

It had the easiest time of the films I\u2019ve seen, and handled it the best.\n\nThe other films I\u2019ve seen which had to recast (or deal with the death of a principle character) would include Harry Potter, Fantastic Beasts, Star Wars, and Hunger Games. \n\nHunger Games ranks 2nd. I haven\u2019t read the books, but I thought the films handled the death of Philip Seymour Hoffman\u2019s character quite well. \n\nHarry Potter would rank 3rd. Richard Harris felt like the perfect Dumbledore, but Michael Gambon did a fine enough job, and the thing fans dislike him for the most was certainly a result of the directors and not him. Gambon portrayed a fairly aggressive Dumbledore in Goblet of Fire, but it was up to the director to reign this in (assuming he didn\u2019t direct Gambon to act that way in the first place). Gambon was far more faithful to Dumbledore in Half Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows, meaning a great Dumbledore performance was entirely possible in the other films.\n\nLeia was not recast in The Rise of Skywalker, but the story was rewritten after her death and archival footage utilized to maintain some semblance of continuity. JJ was dealt a shit hand with Carrie\u2019s death, and I have no doubt Rise would\u2019ve been better if she was still around. But I don\u2019t think the problems with Rise can be entirely blamed on Carrie\u2019s death, so at the end of the day it still would\u2019ve been a bad film - just not as bad if Carrie was still around. \n\nI rank Fantastic Beasts last because this recasting was entirely self-inflicted. Johnny Depp did not die between Crimes of Grindelwald and Secrets of Dumbledore. Warner made the decision to axe him from the franchise due to outside controversy. I never truly got over the recasting, even as I recognized that Mads Mikkelson was probably the better choice for Grindelwald from the outset. It does not alleviate Secret of Dumbledore from the conundrum of recasting a major character despite the original actor not dying.","upvote_ratio":0.44,"created_utc":1678521861.0},{"title":"King Arthur","author":"CrazyCubicZirconia","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/movies\/comments\/11oe0at\/king_arthur\/","text":"I have this tendency to binge niche movie groups.

I've just had very curious thought that after so many action films since Blade and since the MCU stuff, we could do an honest to god superhuman level Highlander movie.\n\nI mean, it's not an original thought, but Highlander is in need of a reboot, what I love about the Anime is that it is distinct in story from the Original, instead of just going through time fighting his own or even befriending some Immortals, we see a villain who doesn't just want to win the Prize, but actually has his own dreams and I like the Kurgan is not a Barbarian (which I think was done on purpose), while the protagonist is very one note. But where both films are similar is how the main characters reflect each other.\n\nI have no idea why we haven't had a new movie yet (I'm sure YouTube can answer that) but we could have a good Duology or trilogy. Not sure who I'd cast, I uses to watch the TV show as a kid (not the cartoon much, but I saw a few episodes on TV years back.).

It\u2019s about Lydia Tar, \u201ca renowned celebrity conductor who is embroiled in a career-ending scandal over accusations of serial sexual harassment and abuse.\u201d\n\nIt is a mixture of curiosity, musical artistry, and in my opinion, abject failure.\n\nIt starts out with an interview of Lydia Tar being conducted by a journalist, a real one from The New Yorker. It\u2019s long. And for a time, you start to think\u2026 is this a movie, or some kind of documentary? After about 8 to 10 minutes, finally\u2026 the interview is over and the movie kicks in. For 3 hours.\n\nLydia is this amazingly talented conductor, but she\u2019s also an arrogant b\\*tch. She\u2019s living a life of privilege in Europe, after a rather miserable early childhood in America. In fact, she distanced herself from that past by changing her name (her real name is Linda Tarr). But she\u2019s easily bitter, aloof, and seems to end up making a lot of people around her frustrated and miserable.\n\nThe pace of the movie is lopsided. It\u2019s extremely slow at times, dwelling on mundane things or taking way too long to get personality aspects across. Other times, it picks up the pace, but then abruptly cuts scenes leaving you guessing as to what happened. And in some cases, they\u2019re never revisited\u2026 we never know what truly happened.\n\nThe movie is all about the downward spiral of egotistical Lydia Tar. There\u2019s no love lost. You never really grow to like her. In fact, there\u2019s really no one in this movie to identify with and appreciate, because they\u2019re all so transient.\n\nAlso, the musical aspect is complex. There\u2019s many references to aspects of classical music compositions and conducting that use high level references most people won\u2019t get at all. I studied classical music piano for 11 years and I was lost.\n\nI am totally mystified why this movie got such a high rating on Rotten Tomatoes and garnered Academy Awards nominations, beyond Blanchett. Cate is in her best form, in terms of role emersion and tremendous characterization. She worked brilliantly hard on this. You can tell. She learned piano pieces and how to conduct an orchestra. She has a good chance of winning Best Actor, but I really hope she doesn\u2019t\u2026 the movie just wasn\u2019t worth it all.

It holds an 81 Metascore and an 84% on Rotten Tomatoes. But these days, the common consensus seems to be that it is self-indulgent and overlong.\n\nEven more dramatically, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) has a 72 Metascore and an 83% on Rotten Tomatoes. It was the sixth highest-grossing film of the year, beating Batman Begins, Madagascar, and King Kong. The movie clearly had an audience. But ask anyone nowadays, and they\u2019ll tell you they strongly dislike it, and more than that, always disliked it.\n\nWhat are some other examples, and what happened with movies like this? Were they always polarizing, with critics seeing something that audiences never did? Or did they succumb to narratives on social media and reevaluations from new audiences who never saw them in theaters?","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1678372543.0},{"title":"I'm going to become a father.

I didn't like the last one much at all, as soon as the killers were revealed literally the only thought in my head was \"Is that it?\" Easily the most boring, forgettable, and definitely the most predictable killers in the franchise.\n\nAnd then this one rolls around. Set in Manhattan, which means suspension of disbelief is going to be working overtime, and the killer can dodge shotgun blasts at point blank range and move throughout the city undetected and has a secret layer with the outfit in a glass case. GHOSTFACE ISN'T FUCKING BATMAN YOU IDIOTS!!!!! Ghostface isn't supposed to be an unstoppable commando, it's supposed to be a psychotic kid\/serial killer enthusiast. He's supposed to loose his cool when you taunt him on the phone, he's supposed to stumble a bit mid chase, and he's supposed to accidentally drop items related to the crime right in front of you while trying to blend in. That's the point it's supposed to be kids trying to act out a Hollywood production as a fantasy but failing a little here and there, not an actual unrealistic unstoppable movie killer, that's what makes it meta. I'll never forget how the fact that Ghostface tripped mid-chase actually made me MORE afraid because it makes it feel so much more real.\n\nTbh they shouldn't have kept going with these movies. It's a similar situation to the Terminator and Alien franchises where those two both should've ended after their second films, and Scream should've been done after the original trilogy. I did enjoy the spinoff series though, and Scream 4 was at least passable.","upvote_ratio":0.3,"created_utc":1678518303.0},{"title":"Official Discussion - Champions [SPOILERS]","author":"LiteraryBoner","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/movies\/comments\/11ncrux\/official_discussion_champions_spoilers\/","text":"#Poll\n\n**If you've seen the film, please rate it [at this poll](https:\/\/youpoll.me\/98135\/)**\n\n**If you haven't seen the film but would like to see the result of the poll [click here](https:\/\/youpoll.me\/98135\/r)**\n\n#Rankings\n\n[Click here](https:\/\/youpoll.me\/list\/138\/) to see the rankings of 2023 films\n\n[Click here](https:\/\/youpoll.me\/list\/4\/) to see the rankings for every poll done\n\n---\n**Summary:**\n\nA former minor-league basketball coach is ordered by the court to manage a team of players with intellectual disabilities.

At least since the days of *Brokeback Mountain*, the conversation about non-LGBT actors receiving critical acclaim for playing LGBT characters has been a sensitive one in moviegoing circles. \n\nThe argument usually centers around the idea that cis\/straight actors are taking opportunities away from queer actors who are all too often usually pushed to the side and relegated to non-leading roles across film and television. It used to be the death of an actor's career to come out, whereas a straight actor could take on a gay role with no detriment to their career, and often to critical or commercial success (Sean Penn in *Milk*, Colin Firth in *A Single Man*, Cate Blanchett in *Carol,* etc). A very recent example, of course, being Nick Offerman in *The Last of Us.*\n\nSince the days of *Brokeback Mountain*, however, we have thankfully seen more and more out LGBT actors have great careers (if not even better after coming out) -- something that was unthinkable a couple decades ago. We have also seen LGBT actors play cis\/straight roles to great critical or commercial success as well (Matt Bomer in *White Collar,* Neil Patrick Harris in *HIMYM*, Jim Parsons and Sara Gilbert on *The Big Bang Theory*, etc.). \n\nDo you believe that non-queer actors playing queer roles should be a non-issue these days? Or would you rather see a Hollywood in which queer actors play queer characters, and these roles stop going to those who aren't?","upvote_ratio":0.32,"created_utc":1678490955.0},{"title":"A Behind the Scenes look into Close Encounters the Third Kind (1977) on how the Alien Creatures were designed, and the different type of Close Encounters","author":"DragonfruitOdd1989","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/63yGG-lMpmE","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.71,"created_utc":1678373468.0},{"title":"Which movie has the biggest difference between the quality of the trailer and the finished film?","author":"ChicagoShadow","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/movies\/comments\/11m8uvv\/which_movie_has_the_biggest_difference_between\/","text":"Good trailers are an art form.

A great American movie review from a Russian perspective.","author":"Timo_Lorenz","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/movies\/comments\/11mr8n5\/do_the_right_thing_1989_a_great_american_movie\/","text":"**Do the Right Thing** (1989) is a cult racial thriller directed by Spike Lee, a well-known black director whose films are always surrounded by heated debates, provocative questions, and criticisms. In this timeless film, the heat, need, and nonsense of a cosmopolitan neighborhood dissolve mutual understanding and empathy, leaving the human body covered in sweat.\n\nChoosing to cover an American film on a racial theme raises the question of its relevance to the harsh realities of modern Russia, particularly Siberia. While modern Russia is a more multinational and multiracial state than the United States, America devotes significantly more words, paper, and film to understanding and confronting racism. This is due to specific historical reasons that cannot be reduced to arguments about *the dying West* and *Russia rising from its knees*. My country's history is replete with conflicts on racial and national grounds, >!some of which we are witnessing today. !<Many such conflicts are culturally reflected in a sketchy, confused way, partly due to inappropriate optics and partly due to a ban on reality which is being implemented in Russia right now. Thus, the story of blacks, American Italians, and Koreans who can't get along can tell us a lot about the Russian reality, where racism has the same devastating effect on the human body.\n\n*Please note that I may not be able to avoid spoilers in this text, even though I will try to reveal the film's ending in general terms. Therefore, if you plan to watch Do the Right Thing, I recommend finishing the film before reading my text.*\n\nIn recent years, Spike Lee has stated that only white viewers ask why the main character throws a rubbish bin through a pizza shop window in the climactic scene of his film. However, the author believes that viewers of all races were likely pondering the actions of the characters, and that Lee's rhetoric transforms the film's conciliatory process into an accusatory one. The author notes that while the film's elements were likely conceived as a means of integrating national culture into a multicultural society on terms of unqualified equality, Lee's rhetoric and actions in the film suggest that these elements have become an end in themselves.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/jnztb1xzvpma1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=188c5aecc5387e685840bfcf64fc1595f3912ff3\n\nThe author questions the effectiveness of actions such as putting a piece of paper on a burnt wall or assaulting a man for a broken tape recorder, suggesting that these actions do not effectively combat the heat of racism. The author argues that the actions of the characters in the film are driven by blind hatred rather than self-defense, and that the violent actions of the multi-ethnic crowd only serve to answer senseless hatred with senseless hatred.\n\nThe author notes that while the director himself becomes a hero in the film, this is a testament to the film's ability to incorporate real characters and events relevant to the issue of race relations. The author suggests that a truce may be possible in the midst of destruction and turmoil, but that this truce is fleeting and fragile. The author also notes that there is no place in Spike Lee's art for love that penetrates racial barriers, and that love only smolders within closed, relatively stable communities. The author questions whether there is a more effective alternative to the use of brute force to enforce respect for history and culture. The film's finale suggests that the portrait of the history may either be supplanted by opposing viewpoints or hang alone on a neighbor's wall.","upvote_ratio":0.53,"created_utc":1678365836.0},{"title":"Is \"The Great Gatsby (2013)\" the first ironic use of 3D?","author":"bennetthaselton","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/movies\/comments\/11ne94k\/is_the_great_gatsby_2013_the_first_ironic_use_of\/","text":"Obviously subjective opinion; nothing confirmed by director or anyone else.

I've always been interested by Maguire, ever since his starmaking turn in Sam Raimi's Spiderman, and he put in an admirable turn in The Great Gatsby. His involvement in the scandal of Molly's Game made me change my opinion of the spandex wearing everyman, and in Babylon he looks to be channeling his inner Evil Peter Parker in his role in Babylon. Honestly, I found his portrayal fascinating, and could have happily watched more, but Chazalle had other ideas, as he jumped from main character to main character, leaving the viewer overwhelmed by the misdirection by the filmmakers.

Specifically, in how much I should like kinda empathize with the protagonist, who is like meant to be like a clear portrayal of a very flawed but kinda redeemable individual but I actually think this dude is like a big piece of shit. In fact, in another story, I could easily see him in the role of that one deadbeat dad who is just useless to the protagonist and is only meant to further reinforce just how miserable he is. The guy is not just permissive and is still friends with a guy who literally murdered a Korean couple for no good reason and finds amusement out of seeing himself murdering them on tape, this dude is also himself a murderer and in the movie, it kinda goes with this idea that yeah, this dude may be involved in some criminal shit but he cares for his girlfriend and the kid but no, this dude would actually be terrible as a father and husband. He gives his stepson a fucking gun and teaches him into becoming into more like him, he cheats on his girlfriend with another girl who he later gets pregnant and when he finds out that the girl is pregnant on a phone call with her, he quickly ditches her as if she were nothing. And then when a friend of her confronts him about it, he assaults him. And I am meant to think this dude is in the process of change and a better life? Nah nah nah nah nah. This guy sucks lmao. He really sucks. And maybe that may be the point but man, it didn't feel like that's what it was going for. Yes, the narrative is aware he does shitty things and yes, he needs time to change, especially in his circumstances but I also feel it kinda has this hope that the character wants to do better for himself and others the more it goes on but instead, he just does more shitty things and doesn't suffer the real consequences until the very end >!when he gets murdered as he is protecting his stepson as a showing some good in him.!< What's also sad is that the girlfriend never comes to really realize just all that he has done and how he wouldn't be the right person to take with him due to his influence to his very son and with all the trouble he has caused for himself and others. Personally, I think this kind of message was better handled in Boyz In The Hood and it does a better job at making me empathize with a murderer and incredibly flawed individual in this film as there is more of a cohesive reason why the character should be seen as a kind of tragic figure despite of being consumed by the violence around him.\n\nAnother problem for me, I guess, is that it does feel a bit super indulgent in its nihilism, which works as a double edged sword in this film in that it makes the life in the hood and those in the hood into such a hopeless and violent wasteland that feeds off the pain of its neighbors and can only think to further run the cycle (Although, it is at the same time, the point of it all since well, it is hard and it can definitely feel that way as someone living that experience.)\n\nHowever, despite my big problem with the protagonist, I was never bored watching the movie. There is this oppressive grimness to it that just captures well how really bad the life for black folks is in their neighborhood and that this is a thing that will keep happening. And it does have pretty darn good production design for a early 90s film. And while it is pretty moralistic at times, it does have good stuff to say like how yes, the police is fucking bad and racism is still prevalent in America but then again, I feel a lot of these movies do this already because well, black people already fucking know America ain't post-racial and police being a bunch of pigs who also protect other pigs' piggie banks.","upvote_ratio":0.48,"created_utc":1678368040.0},{"title":"Little worried about not being able to make my passion movie","author":"Mothman_67","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/movies\/comments\/11n6k04\/little_worried_about_not_being_able_to_make_my\/","text":"For the longest time I\u2019ve always wanted to make a simple basic Transformers movie that\u2019s basically a sorta feel like G1.

The movie follows very strict rules about this for about the first hour. Every scene that doesn't feature Rita either takes place immediately after she falls asleep, closes her eyes, etc. or she can hear it. The scene with the accident detectives is shown after she's fallen asleep. Same with Winkie's. The eyebrow man Dan is actually Diane dreaming she's Rita who is then having a dream within the dream where Dan is describing another dream then suddenly realizes he's still dreaming. >!Lynch'd!< The hobo behind Winkie's is actually Camilla's reanimated corpse. She lives behind Winkie's because that's where the blue key was left for Diane which would signify that the murder was completed. That's why he laughs at Diane when she asks what it opens. Because she's so naive that she doesn't get that he means its to simply communicate with her secretly. \n\nLots more. In this thread we will prove every facet of Mulholland Drive beyond a shadow of a doubt. \n\nBut a little more about what Rita can hear. The movie practically beats us over the head with this. When Betty is on the phone with her aunt learning that Rita is not supposed to be there, the camera makes a long and slow tracking shot all the way down the hallway and into the bedroom as Betty's voice trails behind. This is to make it very obvious that big surprise Rita can hear them from the bedroom. Then right before Betty and Rita meet each other, the entire courtyard scene with Cocoa is practically yelled and sometimes is literally yelled. For example, Betty never goes into Cocoa's home. She just stands outside and literally yells at her through the screen door.

Then 2015 comes around and so does The Martian, another incredible space movie. So began the space movie phenom. \n\n2016 had Arrival, A literal work of art of a film.

This year also gave us Prospect, Annihilation, and High Life, all of which are excellent films deserving a spot alongside these others. \n\n2019 had Ad Astra, a great film and another great entry into this list.

Outside of the Marvel films, 2023 looks to have only one promising space epic film in Dune Part 2, but it being a sequel shows that the yearly original space epic's are definitely slowing down. Could we be feeling space fatigue, much like superhero fatigue post endgame? Why do you think there are less and less big budget space films being made as each year goes on?

It\u2019s a Korean psychological thriller with a twist and that\u2019s the extent of what I knew going into the film. This is because I largely like to watch movies without learning too much background and because I was warned that researching too much would spoil the twist. This amazing 10\/10 twist. Cool, understandable. So I go in blind. And WOW, what a disappointment. \n\n\nIn order of things that pissed me off:\n\n\n1. The main protagonist eats an octopus in the film. It was a gross scene and made me uncomfortable but whatever, it\u2019s a movie. Or so I thought. Imagine my horror to learn that these fuckers that made this movie actually filmed and recorded the main actor devouring FOUR live octopi, on FOUR different occasions for FOUR different takes. Shock value just for the sake of shock value. Seeing any animal cruelty like this for a *movie* would have been upsetting to me but Octopus are legitimately as intelligent as dogs, likely more so. They use tools, recognize people\u2019s faces and build cities. And this actor bit the heads off of four of them. For a movie shot. Disgusting and cruel. \n\n\n2. Main protagonist goes to rape a girl in the bathroom. She freaks out and fights him off, no rape happens. That\u2019s fine; again it\u2019s a movie and I don\u2019t mind that there was or could have been a rape scene. However, it\u2019s the reaction to the rape scene from the victim that just pissed me off. The girl come out of the bathroom, comforts her almost rapist and says \u201cNext time don\u2019t stop, Just rape me.\u201d Wtf? It immediately took me out of the movie because no sane person would say that. Later, it could possibly be explained away with maybe being a consequence of her hypothesis (Is that hinted at? I hope so because otherwise this dialogue is one of the most bizarre responses ever) But even if so, it totally took me out of the movie at the time and I just side-eyed the whole relationship. \n\n\n3. I guessed the \u201ctwist\u201d immediately so it had no pay off. How did anyone not, lol? From the beginning of the movie, the main point is he\u2019s going to see his daughter for her birthday. She\u2019s mentioned several time in the first couple minutes but we never see her. It\u2019s clear she\u2019s very important to him and very important in the context of the film. He gets out, and goes to the restaurant and sees the young girl and she says \u201cOh, you look familiar.\u201d He says \u201cOh, you do too.\u201d There\u2019s no reason for her to know who he is unless she knew him before he got taken and she would have had to have been a child at that time. The first logical thought is \u201cOh that\u2019s his daughter\u201d. A moment later, the film tries to throw you off by saying the daughter is in Sweden, basically saying \u201clook away from this obvious women in front of him\u201d. Except again, the film has already established that the daughter is going to be important. So the fact that he doesn\u2019t call or contact her in anyway is ridiculously suspicious and basically continues to scream that the girlfriend is his daughter. \n\n\nThere\u2019s more but those are my biggest grips. I was really excited for a fun twist but it was so obvious and boring and I hate that I wasted 2 hours on this movie without even a payoff. \n\n\nI accept that I won\u2019t ALWAYS enjoy films that others think are the bees knees but I\u2019d love to hear from people who like\u2019d the film. Maybe I can come at it from a different perspective, idk. \n\nAlso feel free to recommend other psychological horror films!","upvote_ratio":0.18,"created_utc":1678340272.0},{"title":"How come Jennifer Grey didn't become a big movie star after DIRTY DANCING?","author":"Gaze_Celluloid","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/movies\/comments\/11lyr11\/how_come_jennifer_grey_didnt_become_a_big_movie\/","text":"I saw Jennifer Grey in an interview not that long ago, I think she was promoting her memoir, and what a lovely woman she is.

It might be obvious, but I've done some thinking related to the titles of these two works (the movie and the book). I didn't read the book yet, but I know a thing or two about it (which is also said in the movie), like it's called \"Moby Dick, or The Whale\", so technically it has the same title as the movie. And, as they say in the movie, it's not just a book about whales, even if the title might let you think that. I think that a relation between the two titles can be found: the movie is called The Whale, and it makes you think it's a movie about obesity, its dinamics and problems, but in my opinion the focus is (also) on other themes; like in the movie, the book's title might let you think that's just about whales, and it is also about whales, but not just that.

Like was his revelation just that Rachael thought she was human? That was enough for him to throw it all away? Oh, this one *thinks* she\u2019s human so that changes everything (?). Was it because she saved him when she retired Leon? It just felt like the relationship went from point A to point C. Were there any details or scenes that maybe I didn\u2019t notice that make the change of heart? The scenes of Rachael and Deckard in his apartment come off as kind of aggressive and awkward. I just don\u2019t think I took the relationship as seriously as the film wanted me to. Am I way off here?

Am I the only one who didn't think it was scary?\n\nAnd I'm not saying this to seem cool, like I'm unfazed by everything. Most horror movies scare me and creep me out afterward. However, I kept expecting something real scary to happen in Hereditary and it never did. Charlie's death was shocking, and the overall vibe of the film was eerie\/disturbing, but not scary. I don't really feel like it was a horror movie, but rather a drama\/thriller.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, I'm *not* saying it was a bad movie. It was well done, the cinematography was excellent, and the creepiness was good. I just never really felt scared. The scariest it got was the last 5-10 minutes.\n\nEdit: this is just my personal opinion of the movie. I'm not bashing it in anyway or trying to say it was a bad movie. If you found it scary, our opinions of what is and isn't scary are different, and that's okay.

His signature was all over it, it was definitely a very Aronofsky movie, which I have loved so far. And The Whale was good but to my surprise I wasn't as crazy about it as about the rest of his movies. Maybe it was just my mood today and the cinema experience, or maybe it was actually not as good as the rest... I really can't put this anywhere. Everything about the movie tells me that I should have absolutely loved it like the rest, but I don't think I did. So what did you think?
