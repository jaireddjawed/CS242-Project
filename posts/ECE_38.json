We are a group of four so the project should have four modules so that each group member has a task to complete. Almost all of the project ideas I have found by googling seem like they could be accomplished by one person. \n\nInitially I had the idea of putting together an equalizer like the one here http://www.electronicecircuits.com/electronic-circuits/6-band-graphic-equaliser-using-741-op-amp-ic but this seems like a one-person project.\n\nAnother detail of our project is that it should primarily involve frequency response and the 741 op-amp thought it can involve more complex circuitry and IC's if cleared by our professor. \n\nIf you have a suggestion I will gladly hear it.

I was surprised as the usage hit even higher than before, ~150+%.\n\nMy conclusion was that this was the case because I didn't specify that my server should use every available core of the CPU. So it's probably always running on 1 single core, whether there are 4 or 8 available.\n\nBut the one thing that is a little bit harder to test for me is to see the changes in the CPU usage if the frequency were higher than 2.7, say 3.8, all the way to 5.2. My assumption is that because it executes more tasks per second, the CPU won't require as much CPU resources (hence lower usage?)\nHardware is not really my area of expertise and I'd like to get the insights of better connoisseurs.

I realized a major difference between ADS and Cadence concerning variable setup.\n\nIn ADS, the variables are built in with the circuit so if I design a localized circuit with variables (for example, a LNA, a mixer, a filter, with a few variables of the size of the transistors, cap value etc), I can just create a symbol of each of the localized cell and use it as a part of a bigger circuit directly (as for a whole receiver) and all the variables will not interfere with each other even though they have the same name. \n\nBut when I am trying to design in Cadence, the variables are built in with ADE simulation environment. Hence, when I did the same thing as I did with ADS:\n\n1. design the localized cell of independently ( LNA, filter, mixer) \n\n2.Incorporate the LNA etc. into the receiver. But when I launch ADE, all the variables popped up and non of them have any values.  \n\nDo I have to re-enter all the variable values? \n\nIs there any way around it?\n\n\n\nThanks\n",

        "text": "I'm am currently in my first semester as an EE major, but I'm trying to figure out whether EE is for me. Before starting college, I could not decide on whether I should major in mechanical or electrical engineering, but eventually choose electrical due to spending basically my whole life around electronics (like computers, game consoles, not arduinos and breadboards).\n\nAt the beginning of the semester, I signed up for Calc 2, Physics 1 (mechanics), physics lab, intro EE, digital logic, and intro CSC (C++), but I just dropped the CSC class because my grade was terrible. I wasn't giving my CSC class the attention it needed, but I can take it next semester and my graduation won't be delayed. However, I don't enjoy coding and I don't know if I'm intimidated by it or if I just actually don't like it. Also, I don't know if that's a sign I should avoid or not.\n\nAs for my digital logic class, I find it difficult but my grade is ok so far. It's just that I've never been exposed to this type of material and I feel dumb because I don't understand. Also, I feel indifferent about the subject. I don't hate it, but I don't love it and I'm not sure if that's a sign. \n\nI find Calc 2 and Physics easy, but I believe that is because I'm used to the way the subjects are. What I mean is that since I've been exposed to the subjects, it's easier for me to understand them. For calc 2 and math in general, the teacher teaches a topic then I do homework and understand the topic. As for physics, I took AP physics 1 in high school and I struggled a lot in that class, but while I forgot most of what I learned in high school, that exposure to the subject has helped me excel in my physics mechanics class.\n\nNext semester, I plan on taking linear algebra, physics E&amp;M, circuits 1, digital logic lab, and intro CSC. It looks like a tough schedule so I'm willing to spend my whole christmas break (about a month long) preparing for the spring semester, but I'm afraid I may not be fit for EE and I don't want to discover that when I'm either too far in the major or failing a lot of classes.\n\nHonestly (but stupidly), one of the reasons I chose EE over ME is because I thought that I would find EE easier. Also, I'm a little upset that I won't be anymore mechanics related classes after this semester. With that said, I would probably be wondering about EE if I started as an ME instead. \n\nWhat I really want to know is what motivated you to study the ECE field and did you ever have any doubts? Do you have any friends who quit and why did they quit? What signs did you notice before your friends dropped out of the major (uninterested, poor study habits, didn't understand anything)? When did you know this is what you wanted to study? Lastly, what advice do you have?\n\nEDIT: Thank you to everyone who responded. I have received some incredible advice and while I'm still doing some soul searching, I have realized that I didn't have much exposure to programming and that translated me into thinking that I hate it when I just haven't given it a chance.

I thought about studying CE to expand my knowledge of circuits and computer systems while still being able to program. While I don't know a lot about CE's this is the current pro con list that I can come up with.\n\nPros:\n- Expand my knowledge of circuits and computer systems\n- Be able to still program while expanding my future options.\n- Give me options to work in more parts of the computer industry\nCons:\n- I won't be able to focus all my energy on programming which is what I enjoy without a doubt.\n\nIf I could just get some feedback to help me decide more confidently on this switch.\n\nThank you!",

Crossposted with /r/engineering, although I feel I may get better advice from you guys. \n\nSenior year electrical engineer here. So this last Summer, i had a couple of opportunities at internships, but they all fell through. I took summer classes instead to make wise use of time. I feel like having an internship over the Summer before your senior year is pretty crucial, considering its the last one before you graduate, so having nothing to show for that Summer is making me pretty nervous.\n\nAlthough, before the semester ended, I did manage to get a very short gig with a local startup (i'm talking a couple of dudes working inside of a house kind of startup). Not a big company by any means, although they were doing some very cool hardware related things. They basically hired me for temporary work. For about a week, I had to interface an Arduino with some I2C sensors and write code that gathered data from the sensors and logged them to an SD card. This was all a prototype, which they later have implemented on a custom PCB. It's also worth noting that they paid me under the table, so no contracts or work forms were signed.\n\nI'm really hoping to begin a career in embedded systems after graduation (microcontroller-based system design). So, on my resume, instead of putting it down as temporary work, I said I worked as an \"embedded systems intern\" at the company. For the date, I put \"June - July\". As for the description of the actual work, I put down what I actually did, which was prototype an embedded system for data collection and logging.\n\nIs it safe to call this an \"embedded systems internship\" when I never was officially a member of this company? I'm new to applying for jobs, so I'm not quite aware of where to draw the line with embellishment.",

I plan to go to grad school after I graduate, but have a few concerns.\n\n My main concern is basically my lack of internship currently. I've done several personal audio related projects such as amplifiers, equalizers and such, but nothing major due to my limited analog knowledge. I've tried asking analog professors/PhD students for a position, but it seems like they only consider you if you are at least a masters student. It seems like almost any internship mildly related to analog/circuits basically requires a grad student. The only internships I see that an undergrad can do are basically software/programming related(occasionally testing circuits but even those are a bit rare). So for those who have made it into the field(US), how did you guys do it? \n\nAlso, due to various circumstances, I will probably attend a state school without a good research program for masters unless if I want to wait an extra year and dish out $50k. However, I'm afraid due to lack of research with professors, my lack of experience will hinder any chances of finding internships as a grad student.So for those who do interviews, are previous internships a requirement to even be considered? Also, can you comment on how the market is because I heard it's very competitive and hard to get your feet wet in the IC field.",

Right now, this is sitting at 0 rating, and I'm just curious as to why.\n\nSo there's now an old and a new board variant for a project I am working on.  I changed the firmware in about 10 places to support the new board, but now the boss wants me to support both board variants, ideally with all the firmware improvements I have made on the new firmware.  \n\nI know of only 2 ways to do this. \n\na.  At runtime, I figure out which board variant the firmware is on.  A specific pin is at a different voltage.  I then have big if statements around each block of code that is different, doing the old thing if old, new thing if new.\n\nDownside : extra runtime overhead.  A buncha code needed to even check a voltage (it's unfortunately not a digital value, but analog).  \n\nb.  Precompiler directives.  Big block around each variant code, and you set a flag before compiling.\n\nDownside : 2 different firmware images have to be made with each build and if you flash the wrong firmware, it's not going to work so well.  \n\nWhat do you recommend?  What's the accepted standard?\n\n",

At my university, that covers: Kirchoff's laws, nodal analysis, mesh analysis, Thevenin's theorem, Norton's theorem, steady state and transient analysis, AC, DC, phasors, OpAmps and transfer functions. On the first test itself I got a 60, so I know for a fact I'm going to be in a rough ride for this class.\n\nAlthough I do plan on stepping it up and making sure I at least pass the class, if not really gain momentum and do better than I hope, I wonder if anyone else has experience with fairly fundamental circuits classes \"clicking\" later, perhaps in a more advanced class or simply after taking the class itself. Taking this class in conjunction with three other ECE classes and one unnecessarily work-heavy GEP requirement is a nightmare somehow for me. It just never seems like I can really master the material and instead am just trying to keep up (so far).",

        "text": "Hello r/ECE,\n\nFor one of my courses in university I'm doing a bit of research on the best ways to generate electricity from waste heat (think heat from a sheet of metal sitting out in the sun). \n\nI've found quite a bit of information about thermoelectric generator modules, but these are very low-power, typically outputting less than 1V even at high temperature differences. Is there anything out there for higher-voltage applications? Or some other method of generating electricity from a heat source?\n\nBest wishes, and thanks for your time. ",
