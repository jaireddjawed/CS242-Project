When a guy who's felt lonely his entire life suddenly has hope that someone he likes might like him back how TF do you think hes gonna feel/perceive it? I shouldn't have to make this distinction but being lonely or single isn't an excuse to hate women or rape or anything like that. \n\nAbout a month ago, despite me being really really really nervous, I introduced myself to this girl I really liked and we had a great 10 minute conversation. Between her open-ended responses/answers, eye brow raises, and laughs, I thought she was interested in me. Later that day, I asked her if she wanted to get lunch later that week and she said she was busy. Still, because of our first interaction, I was optimistic. Just the thought of me being with her made me so optimistic and happy. When I say that I was obsessed with her I promise you thats an understatement. She's beautiful, friendly, really really smart and it seemed like we had great chemistry. She smiled at me a couple times when walking by in the hallway between now and than but nothing really other than that. Fast forward to today, despite my extreme nervousness I asked her for her number and she said she has a BF. She was really nice about it and I have no hard feelings towards her but :(\n\nI spent 45 minutes in a public bathroom stall crying about this. It felt like a movie. A lonely guy finally getting of his comfort zone and suddenly meeting someone amazing and falling in love. Well, actually, only to find out its not to be. All the hope, nervousness, and thoughts I had about her over the past month or so is now reduced to nothing. If this makes me sound like a loser so be it but I can't be the best version of myself without that special someone. I've never even come close. I'm graduating in June, and I didn't capitalize at all on the best/easiest/most fun/most convenient time to find her. Dating apps suck. Meeting people of the opposite gender irl isn't easy because of the \"elephant in the room\". \n\nYes I know theres more to life than this and having hobbies/friends are important but people who have always been single are never gonna be able to get over not being in a relationship until it happens for 1. ego reasons 2. love/support 3. CURIOSITY, jesus fucking christ, every song on the radio is about love. \n\nHuman beings are social creatures. Also, 31% of guys between the ages of 18-29 are dating but 62% of women in that SAME age group are dating. Uphill battle. \n\n“To love someone is nothing, to be loved by someone is something, to love someone who loves you is everything.” -Bill Russell.",

IQ - Test was taken, due to abnormalities in behaviour ( impulsive, overly anxious ,  shy, rather inattentive and overly egocentric).\nResult was 113-114 (average). I was below average in pattern recognition (95) as well as detecting missing details on pictures (87), finding words with of same meaning  (94) and memory (94). \nI was above average in applied arithmetics (142), processing speed (137) and association (122).\nThe Rest was average.\n\nWhen switching schools (Germany) I got severely bullied in school (age 11-16). At this point I stopped learning altogether and my mental health is very bad ever since.\nNow at 23 I am a total loser, can’t think straight anymore, can’t solve any complex task and my memory has become so poor, I lose everything constantly (keys, headphones, smartphone). \nI basically didn’t do a single intellectual task since ages and get kind of protected by my parents still. Meanwhile my sister studies at an elite University.\nI know now, that environmental factors, education and mental health in particular, do play a large role for developing your IQ during adolescence. I am so regretful about not knowing about this earlier. Every test I participate in nowadays, leaves me at around IQ= 95 or Sth. I can’t grasp on the simplest of concepts and despite being able to read rapidly, I can’t memorise a thing. It vanishes in an instant. My vocabulary is pretty compromised too (mother language: German).\nEveryone of my peers seems much brighter in comparison now, than at let‘s say at age 9. I consider leaving my gf, because of this constant feeling of being inferior (her IQ is 118).\n\nI really am super depressed due to this, especially since now as an adult, my brain power is set in stone.\nI just wish, that I was never bullied, consequently neglecting all my education, social life and brain engagement. \n\nI know it is likely a lost cause at my age but is there a way of recovering some of the lost iq points?",

        "text": "A year ago, I was in the worst position of my life. I was flunking all my classes, got kicked out of a student org after getting into a fight with a fellow member that I was seeing, was in a deep depression after a messy breakup (separate from the previous one), and had zero enthusiasm to do anything aside from sleeping and scrolling through an endless wave of shorts and videos. I never thought of ending it all, but a small part of me wanted to go all Unabomber and live out in the woods and avoid society for the rest of my life. It wasn't until I finally decided to go out of my cave and meet some really good people who gave me advice and opportunities, and I had one great friend who guided me out of the breakup and supported me in getting into a new org that I was recommended by another. In September I was able to get a good position in the org and was doing well in my studies, and I was also building a great network. Granted, there were a few problems on the horizon, as I constantly dealt with bouts of depression and developed a bad drinking problem, but I was able to at least keep those on the down low for a while. Then, I ruined it all.\n\nIn December, my drinking was at its peak because I was stuck at home due to snowstorms. I spent my spare time getting drunk and watching movies, and I'd usually be sloshed by noon. A few days after new years, where I embarrassed my parents by throwing up at a party after a good 12 shots of tequila, I got into an argument with a member of the org. I was hungover and it was really bad, and she was *really* mad at me afterwards. I thought I was giving some badass Walter White \"I am the one who knocks\" type of own on her, but in reality I was sounding like an asshole. Ten days later, I drunk texted her an unhinged 7 paragraph long apology, which prompted her to swiftly report me to the leads of the org, and that swiftly got me kicked out because what I did to her was on grounds of harassment. \n\nTwo weeks later, I lost almost all of my friends and was back to square one. The friend who had supported me was angry and disappointed, my mom's blood pressure shot up to hypertension-like levels because of my behavior, and my father started drinking again after 2 years of sobriety (thankfully he's managed it). I became a shut in again, and for the first time in a long time I contemplated suicide. I've spent the past 4 years burning bridges and doing dumb things, constantly ruining myself for no reason and being my own worst enemy. Yet, one chat with a friend that night changed things around. She was a member of my general friend group, which had become radio silent due to every member being busy, and was open on her struggles with depression. She told me about how she thought about killing herself a year ago, but decided not to because of a movie she wanted to see. That made me realizing that there are so many things I can look forward too. Books that haven't been read, movies and shows from the past and future that I haven't seen, experiences that are to be made. And I didn't want to add any more pressure to my friends and family. So, I chose not to do it. Life is so unpredictable, so many things can happen out of nowhere and you never know where it will go. The important thing is to savor and make the best of the highs and keep your head up during the lows and hope that everything will work out one day. It's been a month, and I'm doing better now. I won't deny that those thoughts cross my mind every now and then, but I'm in a better place. I've got my drinking under control and have started going to therapy. Things aren't substantially better, but I just have to know that things will look up if I just choose to work hard and steer clear of trouble.",

One pack was 200 kcal.\n\nI apparently burned 230 kcal doing a mile yesterday on an incline.\n\nI thought too myself eating calories is like buying things since I’m very into finances and frugality right now.\n\nYou can eat “cheap” items that in the end, weren’t worth being eaten when you think about the amount of work it took to burn those calories.\n\nA high value food item is one that’s filling, tastes great and is low in calories for me.\n\nSo I want to be more picky about what I choose to cook and consume now.\n\nAlso my daily KCAL limit is like my spending budget each day. I want to make it worth it.\n\nAlso walking on an incline for now will suffice + some weights and strength training.\n\nI understand now we eat more kcal so we have strength to work out yet also enjoy more food. What we get is a caloric deficit too for weight loss\n\nMy mindset this time around weight loss is different and more insightful and well informed.\n\nI want to continue making small incremental changes that will compound and build into what is ultimately a sustainable diet and workout regimen for myself.",

I stopped going to bed on time, I´started fapping again and I just don't do any good habits anymore. This has been like this for 4 days now and I just feel horrible bro\n\nTomorrow I want to meditate again and I finally want to be the best version of myself again, because I just can't live like this. If I kept doing what I'm doing right now I'd feel absolutely horrible in 3 weeks. I can't let that happen. \n\nI used to structure my days with a pretty strict routine and it worked insanely well, but now I stopped following it because \"I cAn'T dO It ANyWaYS\" and it's just a stupid excuse now that I think about it. I don't want to feel the way I'm feeling now so I'm changing it and I'm going to bed early today. Tomorrow morning I will finally meditate again, I even noticed that my brain started doing it by itself and it just went into an absolute flow state before I went to bed yesterday, so at least that's still working I guess\n\nI made a new routine that I can follow without doing sports everyday the way I used to and it focusses quite heavily on studying, improving skills and doing things that I \"didn't find the time to do\" before.\n\nI'm actually grateful that this happened to me because now I can improve my skill of getting back on track and now I can actually learn from it. I also realised that my life is only worth living when I cut out instant gratification, I work hard and I do things that I'm actually proud of.\n\nThanks for reading so far, I actually appreciate it.",

I get that people move at their own pace and I’m still close with friends that may not be successful right now but are working towards a goal but I just find it harder to want to spend my time and energy with people who just have no ambition or goals. I do care for these friends still as we were all buddies thru out college and I cant hate on them wanting to party as I also participated thru out college but they just never seemed to outgrow that phase. Most of them have no hobbies and if they arent out partying they spend their entire day laying in bed then playing video games till sunrise. I enjoy spending my limited free time on learning new hobbies, working out and just experiencing new things. I guess my question is what is your experience with dealing with something like this?

I was going through day 8-9 when a friend of mine talked to me about a videogame he was playing. I've never really been into videogames but this time I had an urge to play. Not an instant urge, but a long, well-thought urge. I had this thought in mind; I'm young. I really need to try and explore things before I enter this monk mode life. Self-improvement has to be good, very good, but I also need to try a lot of kinds of satisfaction (not talking about excessively bad things like drugs, mostly talking about videogames and youtube). So I started playing some videogames. Then it quickly escaleted into me being no longer on self-improvement. I was watching porn again and being on my phone for 4 hours. Now I have two options:\n\nTry my best to keep a balance between instant gratification that I really want to try (playing videogames)\n\nOr go full onto self-improvement, which would be good but I would feel like I'm missing out too many things.\n\nAnother problem I have with self-improvement is that, after I stopped being on it, my happiness quickly downscaled. This would be normal because of the bad habits, but it would take more than a while to downgrade my happiness. I think it happened because serious, hamza-style self-improvement can make you have a conditional happiness. This means that all of your happiness will always be based on doing the good habits. Self-improvement should mean getting a strong mental health capable of supporting some days of bad habits, but that's not what happens. As I do not know a lot about it, all I want is a bit of advice.

        "text": " \n\nOne of the biggest lessons I’ve learned from my deep-dive into self-improvement is that there are scientifically-proven ways to increase both your energy and focus.\n\nAfter experimenting with many different protocols I’ve researched, below are the 5 quickest and most effective protocols that have worked for me. These are all things that I’ve incorporated into my daily routine and have seen a noticeable increase in my focus, attention, and energy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Take a cold shower in the morning.** Cold water exposure results in elevated dopamine levels that you sustain throughout the day, resulting in increased energy and motivation. It also helps improve circulation and stimulates the nervous system. Switch out those hot showers for cold ones!\n2. **Get sunlight in the early morning hours.** We’ve evolved over millions of years to naturally rise and set with the sun. Getting sunlight in the early morning hours - specifically, while the sun is at a low angle in the sky - helps tell our body to wake up for the day. As a bonus, it also sets our biological clock and makes it easier to fall asleep at night.\n3. **Stop doomscrolling on your phone.** So many people do this and it could be the single biggest killer of energy today. Our phones are essentially dopamine machines. When you become overstimulated with dopamine (i.e. the “motivator” chemical), you become unmotivated to do anything else besides scroll on your phone. Get yourself a good screen time app - I use “Present: Screen Time Control” because instead of app blocking it actually motivates you by turning staying off your phone into a game - but there are countless others out there. Find one that works for you.\n4. **Wait to drink coffee until 90 mins after waking.** Personally, I love caffeine, and I think most of the science says that it is good for motivation and focus. However, the research is clear: drinking caffeine right when you wake up interferes with your body’s natural wake-up mechanisms, leading to that afternoon crash we all know. Wait at least 90 mins after you wake up for the first cup.\n5. **Practice deep breathing exercises.** Breathing is so important. It seems simple, but a lot of us don’t focus on this enough. Deep breathing exercises can help increase oxygen flow to the brain and improve energy levels. Take a few deep breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth, throughout the day to help maintain your energy levels.",

        "text": "i’m in year 13 (A levels). i just wrote my chemistry mock exam. this is the last school exam i’ll ever get to write as we’ll have boards directly in May. i had many free days to prepare for it but i didn’t. i’m a straight A\\* star student in the subjects i’ve taken at my school. not sure if that will stay the same after today’s exam.\n\nyear 13 started in September 2022. i started super strong. got high grades for all my subjects in the monthly assessments. then we had our pre-mocks in early Dec last year. i did not give my 100% for all the papers but i still managed to get the highest in all 4 subjects in the entire grade. so i’m guessing this must be the reason for my overconfidence.\n\nsince then, for all the assessments and the exams we’ve had, i just stopped caring. i left everything for last minute. for the previous mock exam papers, the least i did was going through my notes and practice a few papers, all one day before the exam. however, for today’s chemistry exam, i decided to not even do that but rather go completely unprepared. i had roughly 12-14 hours to prepare but i decided to spend them by just staring at the 1st page of the 1st topic and wasting my time on social media and watching Netflix.\n\ni faked being sick for 2 of the exams to my parents as i was scared at the time of failing but now i feel as if i need to see a D or a U on my report card to get myself back on track. i want to fail this time. i know it totally sounds crazy but this is what has been going through my mind all the time since the beginning of 2023.\n\nit’s still not hitting me. i’ve just been blank and so lost the past 3 weeks and i’ve not tried to do anything about it. i don’t really know if i’m actually burnt out or just lazy or just overconfident. other thing is i’ve got no long term memory so i can’t recall much of the concepts i had done before. i’ve always found myself revising the same topics again and again before an exam and that used to work out well. however, i’m 100% sure i’ll be failing this exam. and to be honest, i don’t even feel scared anymore. maybe the realization will hit me once i get the corrected paper. i don’t know if i should talk about this to my parents. they’re really supportive and i love them more than anything in this world. however, this time i know it is my fault and it is going to break their heart to hear me talk about the reasons i won’t do well in this paper. do i just lie to them that i blacked out during the paper or what?\n\ni’ve been neglecting my health as well and i’ve not been able to maintain a proper relationship with my loved ones. i’ve spent days crying about this but i just don’t know how to get back up. i’ve exactly one and a half month left for my boards. i have made myself a promise to work hard each day to my full potential and get back to my old self.",

        "text": "Bit of a long one. Skip to the end if you’re keen to keep it efficient. \n\nI’m relatively new to this subreddit, and to self improvement in general for that matter. As the title hints, my life’s been descending into it’s deepest and darkest trough to date. But honestly, I’m not here to wallow in self-pity. Nah. Been there, done that - clearly it doesn’t work. And why would it?\n\nI’m nowhere near where I wanna be in life. I’m galaxies away from the person I hoped I’d be. I think the most heavy part of it all is knowing I have nobody to blame but myself? I, and I alone, have spindled myself into a cocoon of my own anxiety, wistfulness and failure. Ah fuck, I said I wasn’t gonna graze upon a meadow of my own misery, didn’t I? I suppose the positive side of the coin is that I, and I only, can untangle this mess - which is good, right?\n\nMy self improvement “journey” isn’t even in it’s infancy yet. It’s a wee lil’ embryo, waiting to develop - but unlike mitosis, I can’t recursively replicate into the person I wanna be (idk wtf I’m talking about, my biology is trash). At this point my growth has to be the result of my actions, my own conscious decisions, right? Here’s my question: \n\nWhere do I start? Or rather, where did you start? I know it’s different for everyone, and it’s highly specific to your circumstances and goals. Lately I’ve been feeling really apathetic and kinda distant. I think it might help to hear your stories. What made you wanna change? Can you recall a specific event or moment that catalysed your growth? Maybe you got fired, maybe it was a home truth, an argument, maybe you failed a test, maybe you got rejected etc. What emotions did you feel at that moment? Do you need to feel a certain level of unhappiness and discontentment to make a big change? And what does life look like for you now? \n\nThat’s all everyone. To everyone who took the time to read this thoroughly, I just wanna thank you all so much - hope everyone has a blessed day, and I wish everyone here the very best in their efforts to improve themselves ⭐️. \n\nTL;DR - An opportunity for you to share your self improvement origin story. What got you into it? How’s it going now? General advice for someone who doesn’t have their shit together, would like to start arranging their fecal matter into an organised cluster. I took the analogy too damn far 💀. \n\nYours regretfully,\nAn unsatisfied, ill-disciplined idiot who needs to change 🤠!",

        "text": "My partner and I have been together 15 years, and I love him deeply, but a few days ago I caught him in a lie and don't see any hope for our marriage.\n\nHe has cripplingly low self-esteem. Zero confidence and assertiveness. Anxiety, and depression, been medicated since he was in kindergarten. He comes across as kind, gentle, and a good listener, which is part of the problem.\n\nThroughout our marriage, we've had constant issues because of his boundaries with other women. To my knowledge, it's not full-blown affairs (I've never found evidence or reason to believe it's physical), but there has been a string of situations that's allowed short-term emotional affairs to blossom.\n\nA few days ago, he said he was going to dinner with a few guy friends. Gave me a whole song and dance about who is going to be there and how excited he was. My gut immediately told me something was off, and I expressed this to him. He offered to stay home, but I really want him to form meaningful friendships...something he is lacking, so I encouraged him to go. As it turns out he was going to hang out with another woman solo. He keeps his location on, and I saw he was at the restaurant, but an hour later, the location was suddenly off. I called him. No answer. Ten minutes later he calls me and starts making up stories. Being lied to, and poorly at that, is so demoralizing. Another ten minutes later and his location is back on...but it's moving all over and ends up back at the restaurant. \n\nLong story short, he went on a date with this person, and they then drove around for a bit, hence turning the location off. He claims he made up a lie to get out of there and came home. (he did come home earlier than he said he would). He's never gone this far before. I confronted him, as he's terrible at covering evidence and I found out immediately. \n\nIn the aftermath, we've had a few good conversations. The short of it is that he feels he has an addiction but doesn't know what to call it. It's not sex, it's more like the need to be validated and feel worthy, over and over. Women are more open with their struggles and disclose emotionally, allowing him to be the \"good listener\" and feel important. He said, \"it's not that I need it specifically with women, it's just easier to connect with them\". This tracks. When he's had male friends that have opened up, he's the same way with them, but he seems to find it really hard to make male friends.\n\nI should add that we moved across the country last year and have zero community here, so we've both been struggling.\n\nI've tried to word this objectively, but truth be told, I feel broken and sick inside. I have had my own emotional safety and wellness put on the back burner over and over so that he can have these little moments, and it's made me unworthy and unsafe. Having the person you love lie to your face to go be with someone else when your yourself are starving for intimacy and engagement is devastating. When he's home, he often plays video games for hours as escapism.\n\nI know it's not me. His issues would follow him wherever he goes. I don't see a way forward because there is zero evidence that this will ever change, but I do want him to be able to identify what's happening and find a way to get better before it robs him of healthy relationships for the rest of his life.",

Now, in addition to my job, which I enjoy, I have the obligation to go to meetings every day, talk to people and think about it. That's not the least of the problems. My problem is that I can't get it out of my head, I think about it non-stop, from the moment I wake up, and I have trouble falling asleep because of it. It's normal for other people, but it's not for me, now I have less time for ps4, netflix and so on. How can I stop this negative feeling in me? I can't smile properly because these responsibilities have taken over me.",

But my older brother has gotten compliments every now and then (definitely more than 2) and my sister gets about 4 a day. It just makes me sad that no one seems to take any notice of me. And all of these have springed up from going on Disney vacations mostly or wheneve we’re in public for many days in a row.\n\nAnd I could be reading this next encounter totally wrong but I think a girl (or 2) might have found me attractive at some point because i was at universal Orlando with my family and we went to eat and as we were sitting down at our table there was a booth across from where I was standing and there were 2 teenage girls (friends or sisters I have no clue) sitting with who I could only assume were their parents. I’m standing there waiting for everyone else to sit down first cause I don’t really care where I sit and the one girl looks at me, giggles, whispers to the girl sitting beside her then leans over and says something to her dad and points to me, then the girl she whispered to took a (trying to be discrete) photo of me by using the selfie camera on her phone. And that was it, I have no idea what they were saying because it wasn’t in English but it made me feel good that there was even a chance that actually happened.\n\n\nThis isn’t in the pursuit of getting a girlfriend or anything but just to feel better about myself and maybe get my compliment count up to a grand total of 3 as a bonus. Sorry for the rant, probably gonna delete this tomorrow but if not then here it is.",

We looked at each other literally every shift, yet I couldn’t approach or talk to her even though I was 90% sure she liked me back. I have low self esteem and confidence, which played a major part in me not doing anything. I was self conscious about my acne and wore my mask a lot of the time because I was worried when I stopped wearing it she wouldn’t look at me anymore. She was very attractive and I refused to believe she liked me for a long time. Ive now moved away and don’t work with her anymore, its been 8 months but she still crosses my mind now and then. Ive been trying to work on my life, currently taking Accutane to help with acne and starting to feel a bit better looking at myself, planning on going to the gym, trying to get a job for daytime work (used to work night fill). \n\nCurious if anyone thinks its a good idea to drive up one night and talk to her at my old work? I just want to have a better life and feel confidence in myself before I eventually ask her out. I also drove up a handful of times just after I moved work, but talked myself out of anything, refusing she would like me once she knew me. I live at home still, don’t study, currently out of work (quit job last month) but would like a job for morning/daytime to get in a routine again. I want to feel good about myself before anything happens, but finding it hard.\n\nAny advice on how to improve myself? And if anyone can tell me about gyms and what the vibe is like that’d be good too, thanks :)",

The thing is that since i first came to know about cheating in a relationship, i really got scared of such thing happening to me. It made me overthink a lot.\n\nRecently on reddit, i encountered subs related to infidelity and went through some post. I couldn't believe what was happening. So much of cheating in relationships. It made feel so sad and hopeless that i will never get a true loving, loyal and caring partner.\n\nAmong those posts I'll talk about the ones in which women cheated because that's what messing up my mind more. By no means i mean that men cheating doesn't affect me. It makes me feel disgusted on the same level as women cheating.\n\nSo in some situations cheating happened even if both the partners were together for a very long time. Like 20 - 30 years of marriage. This made me sad cuz i used to think the more the people live together the more closer they are and their bond in strong but here total opposite was happening. These women cheating either with a random person they met online, during travel for work or some friend they met after a long time at a reunion.\n\n1. Tbh i am now insecure. If in future, a situation in which my partner is traveling for work or doing a night out will get me worried that what if they cheat on me. How will i be able to trust ?\n\n2. I now think that even though if I'm married or in a relationship for so long won't matter at all. How much i care, love, respect and my efforts won't be of any worth.\nA man will come and destroy my relationship just like that. \n\n3. We all know that fights, quarrels and monotony happens in relationships. Not everything is perfect. It's a problem when it happens a lot or very frequently. But what if during one of those rare rough times, you get cheated on ?\n\nYes I'm overthinking and i know it. But i still can't escape from it. I saw all this happening to men on that sub. One thing i can do is I'll never visit those subs again in life unless something bad happens to me and i require some support.\n\nThat's all. Thanks for reading till here.",

        "text": "# Lesson 1 : Just Get Better\n\nJust get better. **It doesn’t matter how much better you get, if you are consistent with it, the tiniest improvement can compound into something extraordinary.** Your outcome is the result of your habits. Don’t concentrate on the result, **look at the little things you do every day that will get you there or are preventing you from getting to where you want to.**\n\n# Lesson 2 : What Progress Looks Like\n\n**Progress isn’t linear, it is exponential.** Things don’t get better at a steady pace. The results won’t seem like much at the start, but with persistence and consistency, they will skyrocket\n\n# Lesson 3 : Change Your Environment\n\n**Create an environment to help you establish and maintain the habits you want.** Be disciplined but make it easier for yourself by **building an environment that encourages the habit you want.** Remove steps needed to get into your positive habits and add steps to your negative habits.\n\n# Lesson 4 : Don’t Break The Chain\n\nDo one thing to bring you closer to your goals every day. **Do it consistently and once you get a streak started, it becomes harder to break and easier to continue.** If are inconsistent for one day, remember that it isn’t the first day that leads to a habit being abandoned, but the second, third, and fourth time. **Missing one day doesn’t mean you can miss the next.**\n\n# Lesson 5 : Goldilocks Rule\n\n**If something is too easy, you’re going to get bored with it. But if something is too hard, you’re not going to stick with it.** Don’t pick up a habit that is way out of your ability but also don’t pick a habit that is well within your ability.

(Guide to rising early &amp; better sleep)** \n\nThis is how you join the 5am club without it becoming a chore. \n\n**Do you still wear clothes from when you were 16?** \n\n**Then how come you’re still using the same sleeping habits you formed as a teenager?** \n\nYou stay up as late as you please, you have inconsistent bed times, drinking before to fall asleep, and get up at your leisure, like a child. \n\nIf you ran a business like that, working inconsistently, drinking beforehand, opening when you felt like it, your business would fail.\n\nBut when you obey the natural laws that govern good sleep…\n\n**You wake up refreshed.** \n\nWhen you wake up refreshed, getting up early isn’t a chore, it’s natural. \n\nWith that being said, here’s why your sleep sucks and how you can fix it. \n\n*Zeitgebers: cues that regulate the body’s circadian rhythms. (Light, sleep time, noise, temp)* \n\n**The solitary most important zeitgeber is light.** \n\nWhen you look at a bright light for the first time in the day is your new wake up time tomorrow.\n\nRead that again. \n\nSo if you saw bright light today at 4am, without trying you will wake up tomorrow at 4. \n\nIf you wake up early, after going to sleep late you will fuck up your entire day though because when you get &lt; 7hrs of sleep you accrue sleep debt, which like normal debt, we don’t want. \n\nSo to maximize the benefits of the 5am club, you need to expose yourself to bright light AND practice good sleep hygiene to minimize sleep debt, thus maximizing your energy and productivity. \n\nSleep hygiene basics: \n\n\\-sleep in pitch black \n\n\\-quiet room or white noise \n\n\\-only use bed or bedroom for sleep or sex \n\n\\-do not eat large meals before bed.\n\n\\-keep the room cool, bed warm. \n\n\\-ditch all electronics 1hr before bed.\n\n\\-develop a sleep routine to wine down.\n\n\\-sleep and wake same daily, even weekends. \n\n\\-don’t drink coffee after noon. \n\n\\-sleep when you’re exhausted. \n\n\\-stop worrying about sleep, it ruins your sleep. \n\n\\-get a sleep study if your family says you snore. (Or record yourself sleep) \n\nAfter fixing my hygiene, I genuinely get stir crazy staying in bed.\n\nI haveeee to get up, if you want to join the 5Am club, get more deep work down and make rapid goal progress, clean up your sleep. \n\n\\-DK.

I always had a very small number of friends and never was in a friend group. I was always a friend of one of the friends from a circle who sometimes got invited to stuff. \nIt's so different now, I am actually taken quite seriously and I am appreciated by my friends. \nWas I a bad person before and did I just change now?

One night, he told other teenagers that he liked me. They all told me, and they were hyping me up saying stuff like \"oh look your boyfriend's here\". I was so excited. I never had a guy like me before. Ever. All my life, I was treated as a freak, so I was just glad for this opportunity for something special. So I went up to him and asked him if he liked me. He told me he had a girlfriend, and got really mad at our friends for telling me.\n\nHe cut off all contact with with me after. I blocked him on Instagram after he rejected my Instagram request. I was so sad that the guy I liked decided it would be best if he never saw me again. The one person who saw me for all the good I have to offer, and he still gave it up. They broke up two months later, and he still looks at my social media. We're not in contact, but according to my friend, a playlist on his Spotify was made as a birthday present to me. But I don't forgive him. I've never had the privilege of falling in love before, and he just took it away from me. How could we truly ever be in love when he didn't want me? When he chose to let me fall into the abyss? I trusted him. I had confidence that he was a nice person, and it was all a lie.",

No matter what I'm doing, I have a strong urge to just play something. When I'm eating, walking to class, taking a dump. Even right after getting out of bed in the morning. I'm serious. It would be 5 am and I would roll out of bed half asleep, open my laptop, put on my AirPods and play a YouTube video before I even start my day. \n\nI used to do this when going to bed too. I would play something on my phone and put it near my pillow to help me fall asleep. I used to play it in the background while I was showering. I somehow got myself to stop doing this while sleeping. I think it's because whenever there's an action scene or something it gets loud and it'll suddenly wake me up. I forced myself to stop it while showering because I have a roommate now and I don't want her to think I'm a freak. But for some reason I can't stop this habit while I'm doing anything else. \n\nIt's so weird and embarrassing. It affects my self esteem and makes me feel like an absolute weirdo. I feel like it is affecting my life negatively because I can't seem to get anything done. Why do I do this and how do I stop?",

        "text": "Over the past few months, life has gotten harder and harder. I used to be considered a prodigy, but lately it seems like I'm losing my mind little by little every day. I used to experience bullying at school because I was a cry-baby and people enjoyed making fun of me. Every day, I cried, whined, and complained as I made my way from school to home. I wasn't that tough. \n\nFast forward a few years, and I'm in high school. I'm intelligent, I have a few friends, and everything seems fine. What seemed to be bothering me though was my two or three close friends had a group or band, and I wasn't a part of it. I thought, \"Fine man, what's wrong with that,\" and would toughen myself. I successfully completed high school and entered college. I was a nice guy with a cheerful personality, a little shy, but active, and I had made a few friends. I had one particular girl in my life who treated me so well. I only thought of her as a friend and wasn't really into her. She used to call me at three in the morning and would share her sorrows with me. Being a kind person, I would listen to her and try to make her feel better. She gradually started to express her love for me and her growing liking for me. Me a stupid SOB who hasn't had heard those words felt goddamn good and I too started to be attracted towards her and liked her. I assisted her with every subject because she wasn't very versatile in any of them. After a few months of frequent communication during the pandemic, I discovered that she had a boyfriend whom she had been dating for at least three years. To say the least, I was shocked and it was very painful. However I still thought of her as a friend, though I tried to limit our regular conversation. Few weeks later, she needed my assistance with her online exams, but I was preoccupied and unable to provide help. Later that day, when she was crying, she called me and accused me of being selfish for not helping her. I felt bad for her and tried to talk to her, but she blamed everything on me. After that I fully cut my ties with her. As time went on, I started to see a pattern where my so called \"friends\" remembered me when the assignment was due. WTF!, I thought. And when I need help with some small stuff then everyone's gone. People keep taking advantage of me because I was so kind to them.  I've heard people backbiting me while act good in front of me. \n\nSince I was a young child, I have kept my weaknesses to myself out of fear that it will be used against me or that I will be laughed at for being such a pussy. Used to put on a brave face at day and cry myself to sleep. In addition to trying to comfort others, I kept my own fucked up life to myself. But as of late, I've severed ties with a great number of people in my life—or, to be more precise, many of them severed ties with me after their needs was was fulfilled. I now avoid letting anyone get too close to me. Even those who might genuinely care seem to be pushed away by me. Though I have made new friends, I act tough in front and assert my dominance to not let them put me under. As a kid I used to be weak physically, strong mentally but now I'm strong physically and weak mentally.\n\nNo matter how fucked up my life got I just tried to put on a happy face and face life head on.  I was so tough on myself for all these years that its now having a toll on me and now I feel like shit. The remedy was worse than the disease. Its effecting my daily life and I cant seem to complete a simple task and focus my head around small things. I don't use social media a lot, I don't post any sad status, and I don't let anyone know what I'm going through. Even normal conversation is beyond my ability now. I speak incoherently and jumble up words even when I'm speaking to my parents. I cannot seem to understand people's emotion and feelings. It's getting harder and harder for me to even start a relationship. All I know was I wasn't always like this. Lately I have days where when I suddenly feel like chocking on my own breath, with my hands trembling and my body sweating. I just know I have to fight this, but I have no idea how.\n\nTLDR: I feel like life is getting increasingly difficult. I used to be considered a prodigy, but now it feels like I'm losing my mind every day. I was bullied in school for being a cry-baby, which made me feel weak and unable to handle life's challenges. I cut ties with many people in my life as I felt used and taken advantage of. Even with new friends, I act tough and assert my dominance, but it has taken a toll on my mental health. I can't seem to focus on simple tasks, and my communication skills have deteriorated. I have days where I feel like choking on my breath, with my hands trembling and body sweating.",
