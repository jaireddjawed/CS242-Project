        "text": "I've been looking into two schools that offer online programs in software engineering and I need help picking between the two.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSouthern New Hampshire University was the first school I came across and was basically the one I chose until I found Arizona State University. Both programs are very similar but have a few differences that make it hard to choose. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSNHU's tuition is half of ASU which is a pretty big factor for me because I'm already in pretty big debt from doing the first half of my degree (dumb choices with student loans).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSNHU: $320 per credit hour\n\nASU: $643 per credit hour\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nASU has the ABET accreditation. I know this accreditation is not necessary for a job in CS but it makes the program seem a little more legit (although I have contacted SNHU to ask about this accreditation and why they don't have it. Still waiting to hear back.)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe ASU degree seems to have about 3x the amount of math courses that SNHU does, but the SNHU classes look like they would be more relevant to becoming prepared for a real job.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPlease have a look at each program below and let me know what you think. Which one would get me better prepared for a job in software engineering.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[SNHU degree in Software Engineering](http://www.snhu.edu/online-degrees/bachelors/bs-in-computer-science/software-engineering)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[ASU degree in Software Engineering](https://webapp4.asu.edu/programs/t5/roadmaps/ASU00/TSSERBS/null/ONLINE/2017#trackgroup)",
