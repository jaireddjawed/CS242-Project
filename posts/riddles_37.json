They are hopping on a cruise ship to a new land. However they made 1 stop elsewhere and rested for the day. Upon exiting the ship - the captain EMPHASIZED which Numbers they are (1-5) which will play a factor in the puzzle. When they woke up - they were transported to the new land. They woke up in a lodging that is 100% identical where they slept. But when they stepped outside - it's a new place and they are all alone. 10 feet away from the Inn that is in the middle of nowhere is a small 3ft Post with a Paper attached to it via a Dagger.\n\nThis note will say something along the lines of: \"I promised you adventure, here you are\" You are more than welcome to add something else. Perhaps something that alludes that their answers to safety lies within their boarding pass ticket.\n\nWhat the Boarding Pass ticket will entail:\n\n* Passenger Name: TBD\n* Origin: TBD\n* Destination: Praegrandis (Latin for Giant, huge, gargentuan - unknown to my players, they are going to a land of giants)\n* Cabin : C10-15 (this can be changed if you want to use this as part of the puzzle)\n* Ship (removed or ya can use it, change it to fit part of the puzzle)\n* Date: 9/22\n* Boarding Time: 20.04 (Easter egg - Date/Time is reference to the TV Show LOST when the airplane disappeared)\n\nNow on the right hand side of the ticket it will say:\n\n* Passenger Name\n* Lodging Inn: 7 (do not change)\n* Clues &amp; #(1-5) - Each ticket holds a small piece of the puzzle\n\nIf they figure out - if you put the tickets in order from 1-5 - than maybe they have a chance to figure out the puzzle/clues/riddle to their safety.\n\nI would love to see your thoughts as this isn't my forte. Thanks\n\nEDIT: update\n\nThe Answer will allude to the direction they need to go to find a city. It can either be \"North East\" or each ticket answer may say something like \"500 paces North\", \"350 paces east\" - something that gives them some sort of direction... the feet/paces/miles and the numerical value can be anything - as long as it moves them \"North East\", so that they eventually run into a city.",

In northeast, there’s a guy asking for directions at the receptionist at a lobby. However, the receptionist doesn’t know how to give directions. You must help the receptionist to explain where the guy has to go.\n3. In southwest, there’s a corridor with another guy and a doctor explaining medical conditions. However, doctor uses very scientific language that the guy has difficulty of understanding. You must help the guy by translating doctor’s words into layman’s terms.\n4. In the southeast, there’s a woman lying on hospital bed and a guy standing next to her. Woman’s condition is stable but both people look emotionally devastated. You must help them to get cope with emotional stress.\nEach of these tasks takes a bit of time. What priority order would you solve these problems?",
