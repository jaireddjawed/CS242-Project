Meanwhile I have a final round interview with the other team on Wed which I might or might not get it. The recruiter today told me that I have to sign the offer tomorrow, otherwise they will start looking for other candidates.\n\nMy question is if I sign the offer letter tomorrow and then get the offer from another team on Wed, will I be able to back out from the first offer? I know if I am applying to other companies, I can always back out. However the 2 teams today are all in my current company. \n\nSide note, I like both teams, but they are very different and the later one could or could not pay me higher.",

I'll be 36 this week and, save for a single year from 2015-2016, I've been with the same company. I moved from QA to L2 support for Professional Services projects, and now I'm an L3 Support Engineer.\n\nIn May 2020 I got a B.S. in Game Development. At first, I was just looking at game dev studios, obviously, but quickly widened my net to any Jr. Software Dev position. I've submitted hundreds of applications over the past 2 years, and the only interview I've had wasn't even for a dev position, it was for a support role that a recruiter reached out to me about via LinkedIn.\n\nI've also been listed as open to work for months and just can't get any bites. I woulda thought that, if nothing else then by the law of averages, I'd at least have gotten a callback much less an interview.\n\nLately though the one thing that keeps nagging at me is how long I've been with the same company with virtually no vertical movement. I've never had a Sr. or a Lead position, just always an individual contributor. And I always hear about how people change jobs every 3-5 yrs. \n\nIs it possible that my choice to stay with the same company for 11.5 yrs has hurt my chances of getting my foot in the door? Is having too much time with the same company in similar positions a red flag that's preventing people from taking a chance on me?",

        "text": "Hi, all. A bit of background on me: My career in my current field has been a bit rocky, to say the least. I transitioned from another field in 2019 and have had four jobs in as many years. Some jobs I left, some jobs I was fired from. I'm curently unemployed and that sort of job history doesn't look great on my resume. I'm interviewing for positions in my current field, but if I get another job doing what I've been doing and it falls apart again... I don't think I can really show my face again and would have to go into another field again.\n\nThe field I work in now requires a lot of attention to detail and favors the analytical type of person. But you also need to be good with people. So it's somewhat of a catch-22. I'll let you decide which of those is my problem. Anyway, I thought coding and tech seemed like a good thing to try to teach myself should I ever need to turn it into my profession. It seems like something I'd be good at and it can pay pretty well from what I've seen. But I have zero background doing it and would be teaching myself while working fulltime.\n\nSo... My question is basically the title of this post. How long would it take someone reasonably intelligent to teach themselves to code well enough to land an entry-level job? If it matters, I'd likely be starting with Python and then moving on to something like Java or Javascript. I have no real idea how I'd want to apply my skills (e.g. cybersecurity, web development, data analytics, etc.). I just know I want to be good enough to get a job that will pay me enough to live comfortably and maybe then some.\n\nI'd appreciate any help, thoughts, insights anyone could share. Thank you in advance! :)",

That said, a lot of people say that to mean that you could get fired and replaced by someone else at any point. Is that really true?  \n  \nI ask this because this seems to ignore time constraints, the cost to hire someone new, onboarding time, etc. I know a good team is supposed to prepare for loss of headcount, but some things are just unavoidable.  \n  \nFor example on on of our projects recently, our Product Manager left. We were not able to find another quickly and that derailed our project as everyone needed to do the job that our PM had to do, but without PM experience.   \n  \nWe’ve also had multiple times where SWEs left. We often were able to find entry level replacements, but it takes a long time to onboard them and if they’re replacing a midlevel or senior engineer, they don’t even get to the same level of contribution any time soon.  \n  \nIn one instance when one of the lead engineers left it was even worse. They had 1 month to hand off knowledge and our documentation is good, but it takes a lot of time to replace or replicate the vision, expertise, and experience.  \n  \nWith all that, I feel like everyone’s replaceable in the sense that there’s always going to be someone that can do your job, but that it is still very difficult to replace considering it’s hard to find qualified replacements who aren’t already in a job. Every time someone leaves, my managers have always tried to get them to stay and it has always led to missed deadlines.  \n  \nIs this a case of poorly managed teams or is this actually the reality of that statement?",

Like would I be tied to it? Also, would the fact it’s a government job make it perceived less well on a resume? I’d assume it’s more about WHAT I do in the internship that matters rather than the company.

It’s a fun place to work and also offers lots of room for growth which is important for me starting my career. One strange thing is they have a retention program which I have to sign and opt in to for employment. \nThe retention program offers a $30,000 loan that can be forgiven after three years with the company, and $20,000 worth of RSU (restricted stock units) with a 4 year vesting period. \n\nI’m more worried about the loan, interest starts accruing on the first day of employment with an APR of 4.38%. If I leave before three years I’ll have to pay the interest on top of the $30,000. \n\nI really don’t know why they make this a mandatory thing to sign. I can’t say for certain if I will stay the whole three years. Im currently getting paid $65,000 annually, which is not bad for my first job but there’s definitely room to grow. I want to take the job since it’s a company I’ve worked with before and I like, and the job market has been rough since applying for two months straight out of college. \n\nLooking for advice on the matter, should I sign it, and keep the $30,000 untouched in a bank account? Or should I not sign and get back on the job search in a tough job market.",

Been very selective about where I apply/interview, and as a result my preparation and studying has been beyond intensive.\n\n### **SpaceX**: \n\n- Physical on-site at their headquarters in Hawthorne. Senior SWE, they don't do Staff/Sr Staff. \n- Seriously amazing engineering culture\n\nThought I had done really well, but was caught off-guard by a certain engineering problem. Overall figured that my accomplishments, background, passion, and so on, would pull through (accomplishments and proven ability are a big thing @ SpaceX), but unfortunately that wasn't the case. Recruiter took 2 days longer to call, so it seems like the team deliberated for a while.\n\nWas also really disappointed, but at the time I had Netflix &amp; Google interviews running, so I was hoping either of the 2 would pull through.\n\n### Netflix: \n\n- Virtual onsite. L6.\n- Tbh Netflix had the worst interview loop. Recruiter kept insisting that they are hiring a core \"Software Engineer\" (aka bright engineering ability) and not a SRE, but yet the HM call &amp; tech screen call were heavily focused on SRE.\n\n### Google: \n\n- Virtual onsite. L6. \n- Rank-order performance: Googliness -&gt; System Design -&gt; Coding. \n- Recruiter was unable to share feedback, it's a new policy. \n- This is the most recent (literally today). \n\nI was really hoping I'd move forward, which was a 2nd HM call then the HC. There were so many positive signals. Strong team interest, position kept open throughout layoff's, I was only candidate in pipeline, and new candidates were not being accepted as of a month ago. Recruiter responded quickly and with excitement. Everything was pointing in the right direction.\n\nAnd yes, I understand the scope of L6 at Google. It is what I had done, successfully, at my previous company (also big tech).\n\n----------\n\nI'm so damn disappointed. I have studied so hard. I have valuable experience in building massive-scale Machine Learning Ecosystems on GCP. It's a long list of my experience/skillset.\n\nWords of advice and encouragement welcomed.",
