I think  it's outrageous, and she's telling me: \"don't you want to change your  life? It's an investment...etc.\" I have a health issue, but I don't want  to be taken advantage of financially, so I thought I'd ask if this is a  reasonable price or not.\n\nThis  health life coach is a practitioner member of an official British health  association, on the association's website they say that profit is not  their goal, but if one of their members is charging this amount, she's  going against their vision?\n\nWhat do you think?",

They'll do their damnedest to eat nothing except those things as long as any one of them are available (even if it's just rice, they'll eat almost purely just plain white rice for literally a month straight vs. getting a nutritious variety).\n\nBut if I only buy enough of those things that they can't have much, and besides that I have them pick out their favorite vegetables, fruit, greens, nuts etc. Then they'll nibble on those things enough to stave off feeling very hungry. But that's all they'll do. \nThey'll eat 2 or 3 heaping bowls of white rice (one of them will eat 2 heaping bowls of white rice covered in peas, carrots, and corn but never anything else while the other will only eat maybe a quarter bowl with anything nutritious added). They'll eat any amount of pasta til it's gone as long as it's plain, plain with butter, or has certain sauce out of the can. They'll devour a box of Ritz crackers or a bag of lays potato chips. And if they're allowed to do any of that, they can and will go a whole day without eating anything else at all unless it's junk.\n\nSo I'm wondering about research on this subject I guess. Y'all can't give me medical advice, but if you could point me toward relevant research then that's be great. Cuz I know their preferred diet can lead to a lot of chronic diseases, but I'm not sure if I can cut most of that shit out and try for a few months to force them to adjust.",

I have tested on 3 occasions and like 3 different brands and I usually buy the same color of green because I do not like my bananas being sweeter than a can of soda pop, yet I notice when I bought non organic I would have to eat them super fast, yet now that I'm buying organic I'm like yo these bananas are still literally green almost a week after i bougut them wtf is going on. Also one thing I notice with this certain brand of banana is that it's way slimier and juicier than other brands, which I like better. I am just wondering are there really no difference in organic vs non organic counterparts cause I'm starting to find that hard to believe.",

        "text": "Hello all,\n\nIt seems nowadays everyone is sharing threads on supplement stacks and how important they are great for preventing inflammation and the oxidative stress that occurs in our bodies. I know there are studies that show that a lot of these supplements have positive health effects, but are these supplements really that effective for long term health outcomes if you already follow a healthy and well rounded diet? Are they  any studies that control for diet with these supplements?",

My dad had a stroke and needs to eat extremely low or no cholesterol, but I keep seeing conflicting information about it. Like how it's apparently a healthy cholesterol and okay to eat but then something will say it's really bad for you. Does anyone definitively know the Cholesterol information for shrimp?",
