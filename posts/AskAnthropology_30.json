Also I do not have a good place where I camp to store all of the acorns above ground due to rain and animals too lazy to collect their own (lol), so I have followed extremely vague accounts of ancient people's storage of acorns which basically involved digging a hole in the ground and placing the acorns into it. The accounts I have based this practice on are extremely lacking in procedural information as to how ancient people stored acorns underground for the long term or even for the short term. Does anyone have some more detailed accounts on the underground storage of acorns for human consumption, be it in ancient Europe, Native America or elsewhere?\n\n- What kind of processes were involved in preparation of the acorns for burial (if any)?\n\n- What kind of ground conditions were preferred, how deep were the holes, and how long could the acorns be stored? \n\n- As a bonus, is there a differentiation between pits used to simply store the acorns and those used to \"cold-leach\" the acorns over months underground?\n\n",

        "text": "It seems like at least in the Old World (I've heard Native Americans saw women as equal or even better than men, but I'm not sure how true that is, or if it only applies to certain tribes) men pretty much universally treated women badly. It seems like up to the early 20th century men were expected to beat their wives, rape was only seen as a serious crime because it offended the dignity of the woman's husband or relatives, women were not allowed to go out in public and it was universally accepted (at least by men) that women were the inferior sex.\n\nWhy do you think such attitudes and behavior were so universally common? Are a very large proportion of men just naturally selfish and violent without enough law and order and social conditioning? Does it have to do with religious beliefs? Were women looked down upon in part because they were seen as \"unclean\" due to menstruation?\n\nWere there significant numbers of men throughout history that saw women as true equals and treated them kindly and without patronization, or were they considered radicals? Was it common for a man to love their daughter as much as their son, or their mother as much as their father?\n\nOr is the idea that women were universally treated horribly by men throughout human history a myth, or only partially true? I've heard in Egypt women had high status, though it may only be relative to other places like Rome and Greece.\n\nWas being a woman during history almost invariably a worse deal than being a man? Did most women throughout history live lives of constant physical and sexual abuse at the hands of males, confinement, unpaid and unappreciated labor, and oppression? Or did it depend on the time, place, and social class? Were there any societies that were truly egalitarian, or even favored women over men?\n\nWas there anything uniquely sucky about being a man in the old days, aside from being expected to fight for your king?\n\nI imagine life during most of history sucked for 99% of the population, but it seems like it sucked for women a lot more because most men treated them as inferiors, and many men treated them downright terribly.\n\nWhy are men (at least in some countries) much better to women today? There's still a lot of mistreatment and discrimination towards women, but at least in Western societies they are ostensibly equal under the law, crimes against them are taken seriously, and a very large proportion of the populace (including plenty of males) subscribes to the theories of feminism.\n\nWhy didn't women treat men in a reciprocal fashion? Is it because women are more empathetic and compassionate by nature than men? Even today, it seems like very few women are truly misandrist - they only hate men who they view as immoral or abusive, but will almost always defend the good men in their life.\n",

And I just don't see the point in that.\n\n\nWhy do we care so much about vengeance?

In other words, does the education system properly prepares anthropologists from various disciplines for the real world, or is it lacking in some areas? ",

It surprised me then, that certain native tribes believed that tornados were caused by a horse-like spirit. Their first exposure to horses couldn't have been much earlier than 1500, so how did they manage to work themselves into mythology so quickly?\n\n&gt;Would natives in later centuries even be aware that horses were old world animals ?\n\n&gt;How common was it for new cultural myths to be made in this period (post european contact)?\n\nIf the above is true, what exactly is going on here?

Throughout history there have been so many cases of one group of people massacering another group that I can't help but wonder what function genocide serve in human societes. The fact it has happened so often indicates to me that there is some kind of \"positive\" side effect to genocide that I can't see. After all there must be a reason why the concept is so widespread and \"successful\" throughout human history. \n\nWhat do we know about the causes of genocide? Why exactly does one group of people decide to kill another after decades or even centuries of living together? Why do societies tend to break along ethnicites turning on each other? Is genocide serving as some kind of self-regulating mechanism in a society? Does it reduce ethnic tensions within a society by removing one group from the equation?\n\n\n",
