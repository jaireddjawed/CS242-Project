Millar. \n\nIn the book, the authors explore how cryptographic technologies can help civilisation\n\n\\- Cooperate\n\n\\- Defend itself\n\n\\- Do both in light of AI\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BL6J64KW](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BL6J64KW)\n\nJuan Benet, Founder of FileCoin and Protocol Labs, said: *“Reading Gaming the Future is essential! It is a masterpiece of modern philosophy, and its lessons are crucial for our civilization's survival and flourishing. Unlike most works of philosophy in history, Gaming the Future is firmly grounded in science and economics, it is a delightful and accessible read, and it paints a deeply inspiring vision for our future. This book should be a required read for everyone, especially those in government, economics, science, and positions of power.\"*\n\nPeter Norvig, Director of Google Research, said: *\"Rodney King asked \"can we all get along?\" and this book attempts to answer his question, explaining the current state of the world and a mechanism by which a diverse population of people with diverse goals can make the world a better place by voluntarily making small choices that improve things for some without harming others.\"*\n\nDavid Brin, \"Gaming the Future raises important questions about how - and whether - it is possible to avoid future dystopias by leveraging the power of diverse and competing citizens to plan, to predict, and evade the pitfalls ahead.\"\n\nKate Sills, Software Engineer, “As Wendell Berry has pointed out, academia has splintered into fragmented, one-eyed specialties; Gaming the Future does not make this same error. By integrating economics, law, cryptography, political science, blockchain technology, and artificial intelligence, Gaming the Future is a fascinating look at what we might be able to accomplish if human cooperation is designed for and allowed to flourish.\"",

Far better than anything I’ve seen before but today it really surprised me. I asked it to make up a joke about meerkats, and after a few seconds, it replied “why aren’t meerkats invited to play poker?” “They keep their cards too close to their chests”. \n\nIt’s not a very funny joke to be fair… But the connection between a meerkats posture, when standing, and the colloquial phrase, (cards close to the chest) is really clever and subtle. TLDR chatGPT surprised me today.",

Spoiler alert:  die in game die in real life.  Spoiler Alert 2, after many escapes and incarnations, the associated sequel film has everyone switch to an AR system which essentially eventually develops the same lethal problem.  \n\nAll this context is to say, that people got sick of straight VR at some point, and moved into an AR space in this hypothetical future (the actual year of the events I think has passed lol). We have so many examples in Science Fiction of VR systems, Matrix, Ready Player One, SAO, various other shows, most of which end with the moral \"Reality is more worth it\".  The Metaverse as imagined by the companies that are investing it is obviously not going to work that well, too commercial, not realistic enough.  VR chat gets close, but it's become, from what I've seen, a bit of a meme pit.  And still, adoption is increasing with cheaper headsets, but still so many people, myself included can't sit and play for too long without getting tired necks and headaches.  \n\nEnter AR.  On my Oculus quest, I found myself using it for web browsing.  Three huge monitors playing youtube, scrolling reddit.  But I felt I didn't need a super heavy headset in a full virtual environment to do that.  I've seen attempts at AR glasses like the Nreal Air, but reviews are less than stellar.  \n\nI think there's something to be said about tech's intrusion into our routines.  We want Alexa to be able to play a song, but not have to always ask Alexa to do it.  We want to get all our vital notifications, but be able to swipe them away when we want to focus on our in person interactions.  I believe that AR can function much in the way the early adopters of Google Glass hoped it would, like a video game heads up display.  Vital information when you need it, media consumption when you want it, gaming levels of immersion if you're willing to spring for the delux package.  I feel like I can compare it to the smart watch.  People imagined the idea of a spy watch for decades.  And there are multiple levels of smart watch out now.  Some can just do texts calls and navigation, for people who want to prioritize real life and limit screen time.  Some become vital monitoring tools, giving athletes and adventurers real time statistics and life saving guidance. I believe that AR, as a more modular, simple and adaptive system is the future of alternate reality tech and media, and VR will remain a sort of high immersion, but less used system.

I thought to myself how the microchip Engineers in the 80's were either super lucky or prophetic to see their profession become so influential, 20, 30, 40 years later.\n\nIf you were born this year and started college around 2040, what do you think would be the best profession to ascertain a similar level of global importance/influence? Does this field even exist yet?\n\nWhat profession will bring the most income/prestige/influence around mid-century?",
