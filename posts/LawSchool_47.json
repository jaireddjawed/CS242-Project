And from what I've seen, a lot of times you have to make a decision between paying sticker/getting in debt for the higher chance of getting into BL, or getting less debt at a lower ranking place but having a lower chance of BL.\n\nMy question is with what kind of reliability can you get mid sized law in a big city (if you strike out of BL) and would the salary be at all near the second higher salary mode made by BL? For example, if I'm considering Notre Dame, and I strike out of Chicago BL, is a decently well paying (6 figures) mid/small law job in Chicago at all likely? If you have any idea about this please tell me, or if there's a specific way to calculate this given the ABA data please let me know. I'm just trying to figure out what happens if you go to a a place like NDLS and you strike out of BL, are you pretty much forced to take a 60k a year job or are there other well paying private sector options?
