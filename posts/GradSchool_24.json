        "text": "I really don't want this to come off as complaining from an ivory tower. I am very thankful and feel very lucky to have gotten the NSF GRF, but it has been a fucking pain to deal with.\n\nFirst, there's no W2 and it's obviously not tax exempt. This requires you to either make payments ahead of time (in quarterly amounts to the state), or to take the brunt of it during tax season. As a someone who is trying to grow literacy in finances, this was a rude awakening when doing my taxes last year, having to pay several thousand to state and federal because I wasn't aware of this. You get mixed things online, I've heard of students not paying any taxes and seemingly getting away with it. I've even seen a post about an IRS person saying you can't get it traced back to audits. It's just wild.\n\nSecondly, because we are students we have no help from university financial services when it comes to tax season. It is a fucking disaster trying to file taxes from financial aid with no W2, just a 1040T. It's hours of moving things around to different forms hoping to get a smaller bill.\n\nThirdly, getting any help online is a lost cause. Half the links for the website are dead. It's mostly just searching on reddit to find answers from past winners on what they have done. And as said above, its a complete mixed bag.\n\nLastly, and most absurdly, I lost half my years worth of tuition payments (that can keep me on RA status) because our lab moved schools. Since I was at school A for &gt;6 months, they keep all of my class payments until the next cycle. So it seems as though my PI has to pay for my RAship out of their own pocket at school B because NSF says school A can keep the rest of the money. What the fuck is that? Absolutely absurd, luckily my PI has the funds to do so, but what if that wasn't the case?\n\nShort rant over. I know I'm lucky and I am truly very thankful, but shit could use some serious reforms. Especially on top of the daily/weekly/yearly torment us grad students have to deal with.",

        "text": "Hello all. I just graduated with my bachelor’s in Chemistry in December. I recently interviewed for and received a job offer for a research assistant position in a drug discovery lab. The pay is pretty bad, esp. considering the ~economy~ rn (about 35K- and it’s an expensive city). They also prefer that entry level employees work at least 2-3 years in their lab, so I would have to take an extra gap year (or quit early and risk not receiving any recommendations from them). I am pretty sure similar jobs I apply for will offer similar pay. The benefit of this lab is that the PI is highly distinguished, and everyone who works there seemed really happy. \nAnother option I am considering is taking a stereotypical type of gap year. Pick up some gigs on coolworks, travel and try new things. I’ll still be broke but most of these jobs provide a stipend, food, and housing. \nI already have extensive research experience from undergrad (3+ years) and I have 2 research pubs and 1 pending. I should be able to get good recommendations from several professors from my Alma mater. \nBasically I am wondering if the first job (research assistant) seems worth it if I plan to apply for grad school in an area of chemistry. And any other thoughts you might have are welcome",

Just got some reviews back for a paper I submitted to a journal a little back (my first!) before I graduated undergrad (currently waiting to hear from grad schools now).\n\nTo be frank, it's really daunting and discouraging. While one review was brief and unhelpful, the second was pretty brutal (really good though lol). It hit all the weak points I knew the paper had, and I'm really not sure how to fix those issues. I'm drafting a potential rebuttal to talk about with my former advisor, but I'm feeling a bit ashamed for submitting what I knew had issues. My goal was to get something in submission for grad school apps, and now I'm paying for it. What's worse is that the reviews of the paper will be made public, so everyone will be able to see the paper's shortcomings. I'm afraid it'll be a stain on my record until I publish something in grad school. That's assuming I even get into grad school and that there are any potential PIs who would take me given this paper and its reviews.\n\nI have a feeling I'm being emotional. I read from a professor's blog that during their PhD, about 80% of their conference submissions and over half of their journal submissions got rejected. I know this is part of the learning process, but I can't help but feel a bit crushed thinking about how it might impact my future. There's so much pressure in having to learn as I go yet have all my mistakes count against me at the same time.",

My PI has recently told me these meetings do not count towards my 20 hours because I am a student and they are for “my professional development.” I know it’s only 3 hours but I’m a little upset by this because not only am I expected to prepare presentations for this, but we also rotate taking notes for these larger meetings monthly and our lab group is small so I end up up taking notes for the group for a few months out of the year. I think an argument can be made that my 1:1 meetings are not a part of my work day but the other two are mind boggling to me. \n\nWhat is it like for you? Maybe I am overreacting because I am an older student who has had full time “real” jobs before going back to school and I would never be expected to have meetings with my boss and coworkers outside of my work day during these jobs.

They want to continually provide mixers and game nights when students are frustrated with some huge issues that our university is posing. I think there is a huge disconnect with respect to the issues that students are going through. How do I bridge the gap here? How do I show them all the issues that the community of students are going through and that no amount of socializing and mixers will ever fix this?\n\nEx: we have no formal grievance process at the school; ancient professors do not care about disability accommodations, and the school does not care about it; casual discrimination issues\n\nHow would you go about this?

A is a really good lab, PI has tons of funding, great connections, great facility, awards, etc. I rotated with A, told me to go rotate with C as well since they collaborate on the project I want to join. A is also really competitive to get into, so I agreed to rotate with C in a few weeks, even though it’s an engineering lab which I’m not into at ALL, but thought maybe it’ll help me understand A’s research better. Now I learn that if I join I might need to do a comentoring situation with both A and C which I’m really not into since I don’t want to get into biomedical engineering. Theoretically I could ask to stay solely in A if I don’t end up liking C when I rotate, but I’m not sure if that’ll seem odd since I agreed to rotating with C and if it will lower my chances of getting into A. Also, I’m not really a fan of the lab environment in A, it hasn’t been super welcoming from the other grad students, but the PI is a good mentor. I won’t get a lot of guidance since she wants independence, but I feel like it will be hard but make me a “better scientist.” Also, the PI will be retiring when the grant that I’m joining will finish, so theoretically we would be leaving at the same time, which I’m not sure if that’s a problem. \n\nOn the other hand, B is a good lab, has a great lab culture, I enjoy the methods used, really sweet PI that I feel comfortable asking questions to. BUT I’m not into the overall research topic at all, and really don’t want to be stuck in that field, and when I think about research I’m SO much more into A’s research. \n\nTLDR: Which lab should I join? The lab that checks all the boxes but I don’t like the research, or the one I really like the research, but has a lot of other problems",

I don't think he is cut out for grad school and unlikely to get in. He also has autism and call nearly everyone ableist. Even though I think his flaws are mostly unrelated to his disability. \n\n*He is always asking for information, then literally argues that your wrong. Sometimes the answer easily Google-able. \n \n*I send him multiple awards/internships to apply for. He won't apply for smaller more local awards/internships because he only applies prestigious internships and awards. His excuse is he only wants a job he is 100% interested in. I have explained multiple times how he needs to build his resume up and how he isn't competitive yet for the top tier opportunities. \n\n*He doesn't allow anyone to read over his personal statements prior to sending them out. I have offered and I know his advisor offer to edit. Also his writing I have seen is atrocious but he doesn't want feedback. I even suggested the writing center or a writing class\n\n*Multiple people (professors and students) have told him a handful of really good classes to take to gain skills, but doesn't take any of the suggested classes. He always has excuses. Generally its \"your wrong. that won't help my career\" or \"I don't want to take that class so I wont.\" Like programming. He literally won't learn programming or even excel. When in our field you really should know programming or atleast be good with excel.\n\n*later say he isn't eligible for certain internships because he didn't take a programming class or whatever else was suggested \n\n*he refused to do undergraduate research when atleast three professors asked him to join their lab and he would be paid. But he said he rather tutor than do research. Even after it was explained that research would help with getting those prestigious internships and getting into graduate school.\n\n*now he claims he doesn't have enough of a resume to send to potential advisors. Which I don't know how that can be true, because I know of high schoolers who have resumes (boring, plain but they exist)\n\n*he doesnt want to do any graduate research involving programming, modeling, machines learning, field work, lab work, or data analysis. \n\nEveryone is exhausted by him but too afraid to be direct with him anymore because he calls people ableist when they give constructive criticism. But then he realizes people aren't being direct anymore so he calls them ableist anyways because he needs directness. Which I understand and generally would provide directness. Also I'm sure their are real ableists in the department but I can't tell which are actual offenders because he call everyone ableist. \n\nHe is about to apply to grad school and I really doubt he gets in. I think he is book smart but I don't see how he will be successful in grad school if he can't take constructive criticism and his refusal to improve himself. I wouldn't take him as a student, or even recommend him. He has zero back up plan if he doesn't get into grad school. \n\nAny advice? I don't want to discourage him, but he has asked before if I think he would get in and if he would be good at it. I just said its not my place to judge. And I felt bad because he was looking for validation but I just couldn't give false hope. But then he got mad that I was vague and not direct. Then a few weeks later he has asked again. Do I just avoid the question forever? I don't want to give him false hope, and generally I'm a bluntly honest person. But I know even if im tactful he will call me ableist.",

And this semester I’m in another group with. This is an older international student who does not contribute in any way to our group work. He sleeps through meetings, shows up 2 hours late to a 4 hour class, says because English is not his first language that we need to write his presentation parts for him and skates by getting the same mark when we do all the work. He already has a phd from his own country so we know he’s not unintelligent and we have other international students with language barriers that still manage to contribute to the work. And he’s been here for almost 5 years.\nI’ve spoken to him personally and he said he’s only in the program to find a girlfriend and get a job as our program has a mandatory coop placement. We’ve brought up concerns with our profs and they recognize that they know he’s doing this but say their hands are tied by the director of the program and they say just to give him a lower mark on our group evaluations. \nI spoke to the director (a white women) and she scolded me (a bipoc women) for not being welcoming to other minority students and accused our cohort of being cliquey bc no one wants to work with him. He also says questionable things to the women in our program. For example, I wore a dress once and he asked if I had a boyfriend and that if I do, he’s lucky because my legs are beautiful and shapely.\nToday we had to present a progress report on a research project we’re working on and he just didn’t show up to class. An hour into class he msged and said he wouldn’t be there and to present his part for him which we were not prepared for.\n  Ofc I empathize that it’s challenging being an older student in a completely different culture but that doesn’t mean that we should not be able to hold him to certain standards. Any advice on how to navigate this?",

I've also noticed some of his interactions with other students that are not great. I don't want the environment in the classroom to be soured by him, mostly for the sake of the other students' experiences, but I also really don't like the feeling of this kid trying to \"catch me\" slipping up during lecture either. It makes me nervous, and as a first time instructor I am already nervous enough! I am also a young woman, and I think it comes across as pretty obvious that I am not too much older than many of my students, so establishing a presence of respect and expertise is already tough to begin with. \n\nI don't want to make a mountain out of a mole hill, and maybe he'll chill out as the semester continues, but I also don't want that vibe to run unchecked if he doesn't chill out. However, I have zero idea how to handle a situation like this. Has anyone had experience with undergrads like this before? How have you established respect and expertise as a grad student, especially in the face of students who seem far too eager to make you seem like you don't know enough?",

(For context, I’m a grad student pursuing an MA in English). \n\nProfessors in our department love to talk about the career opportunities for English MAs but rarely actually address how to take advantage of/find these opportunities. From my perspective, it seems like these opportunities are all veiled in ifs and maybes.\n\nTwo instances come to mind:\n\n1.) I had a Brit lit class. The professor got on a tangent one day and started asking everyone what they wanted to do post-graduation. Some people wanted to teach, some wanted to edit, etc.\n\nShe says, “Oh, you won’t make any money doing that. You all should try writing for TV, that’s where the big bucks are.” Then, boom, right back into the lesson, no explanation.\n\n2.) I work at a business on campus part-time. An English professor came in as I’m chatting with a coworker about what we were going to do for money over winter break. We were talking about various seasonal positions and what they pay. Professor chimes in, “Oh, you could make way more money than that with a writing job. Anyways, take care!” Then she was gone.\n\nInstances like these happen all the time, some vague allusion to making money through English without any explanation. They always leave me thinking “what are you talking about? How?”\n\nOf course I know it’s possible to make money writing, but I get frustrated with how oversimplified faculty likes to make it seem. It’s starting to feel like an inside joke between the faculty to torment broke students. \n\nFor a lot of us, finding a way to make money in our degree is a big stress so it comes off as tone-deaf when faculty makes it seem like writing jobs grow on trees, pay lavishly, and hire anyone just starting out.",

I am currently in the process of writing a research paper on any topic I choose (as long as I am identifying a research gap) \n\nI am incredibly interested in and passionate about mycology, mushroom growing, psilocybin, and microdosing, catalyzed by a literature review I did on its effects on various societally predominant disorders including depression, anxiety, PTSD, addiction, and disordered eating. \n\nThroughout my life, I have suffered from Irritable Bowel Syndrome, a collection of disordered symptoms of the bowel, along with up to 20% of the population. According to modern Western medicine, there is no cure for IBS; it is simply something one must manage and deal with. \n\nBut, during my exploration last year regarding psilocybin therapy and my own IBS diagnosis, I started researching microdosing and became curious about potential for a relationship to IBS.\n\n\nAlthough I attempted to research this, all I found were a couple of anecdotal reports on subreddits and other forums. I believe there is enough surrounding research to support the idea that microdosing could have a positive effect on IBS symptoms:\n\n\n• The brain-gut connection is strong, and rewiring one may rewire the other. \n\n• IBS often results from a long-term high-stress response, such as depression, anxiety, or past trauma, which microdosing can alleviate. \n\n• Microdosing has shown to lead to a desire for healthier habits in eating and thus could positively impact diet-related IBS symptoms. \n\n• The fact that mushroom trips are often associated with \"the runs\" and increased motility show promise for IBS-C patients. Although microdosing does not result in a 'trip', the same effect may be seen at a lower level in such a case. \n\n• Mushrooms seem to work on 5-HT receptors, and unbalanced 5-HT may be associated with IBS. Perhaps a 'realignment' of 5-HT functioning caused by microdosing could have a positive effect on IBS symptom severity. \n\n• Microdosing has been shown to reduce immediate stress, which is thought to increase visceral hyperalgesia perception. By reducing this stress, abdominal pain and related IBS symptoms may be relieved.\n\n\nI would love to be able to explore this topic for my research paper, which is why I am asking - is there anyone here who has IBS, or suspects they do, and would be willing to participate in a research study in which they would microdose psilocybin following the Fadiman Protocol for 6 weeks, reporting their IBS and associated symptoms at the beginning and end of the period? \n\nIf you or anyone you know has or suspects you may have IBS and are willing to participate in this research, please reach out to me for further details. \n\nNOTE: it is your responsibility to ensure the legality of your participation in your country/state/region/province. Although I will not ask for location, if you provide any implication that what you are doing is illegal, you will be cut from the survey. \n\nThanks all",

        "text": "Hey everyone! Hope you're all doing well :) I'm making this post because I recently finished up my last semester of undergrad this fall, and while I know that I want to go to grad school and that I want to take a gap year before applying to grad schools, I'm completely lost as to what I should be doing right now.\n\nAs things stand, I'm in my home-state living at home with my parents. I've been out of school for less than a month, and have no job, part-time or otherwise, lined up. I'm effectively a clean slate right now. Should I be applying for part-time jobs just to save money and fill the time? Is it okay to relax a little bit, save some money to do fun stuff and travel before grad school, or should I be looking for internships or full-time jobs related to my major? I've only had one job before in my life so I'm not completely experienced in the work-force and job applications. I have no idea what the time-frame looks like for getting a full-time job or if that's even what I should be focusing on right now.\n\nI just feel like I have a million questions related to adulting that everyone else seems to already know the answers to. Like how do you find out where you want to move? How do you afford an apartment in a new city without a job? When do people find the time to save money for an apartment or a new job? It feels like everyone just went straight from undergrad to their fancy apartment and fancy job in a new city, and I'm just like... how did they get there? I know these are sort of broad and vague questions, so please feel free to dump any and all advice you could have for someone as confused as I am right now! \n\nFor reference: I'm a sociocultural anthropology major with experience in political science. I'm also located in the U.S. I've had some struggles with mental health in the past which is why I finished my last semester this past fall rather than in the previous spring if that makes a difference.",
