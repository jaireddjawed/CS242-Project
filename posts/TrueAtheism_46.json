Many people in America who are not (or have never been) evangelicals won't understand this, but I have a feeling that many ex-Christian atheists will know exactly what it's talking about.\n\nSome of the most troubling bits of the OT are the numerous divine commands for the Israelites to wipe out neighboring tribes. In particular, Saul is commanded to wipe out every last Amalekite man, woman, and child, down to the last suckling infant.\n\nThis is, of course, totally repulsive to any civilized person. But many Biblical inerrantists defend the supposed divine mandate and the supposed actions (assuming they actually happened) as being good, because God.\n\nJews still refer to various figurative and literal Amalekites. Some Christians and Jews believe that Hamas and any anti-Israel Muslims are Amalek today.\n\nIt's apparent that the USA stands alone in its unwavering support for Israel and their actions, and the USA also stands alone in its population of politically dominant evangelicals. This is no coincidence.\n\nI believe that there is a *HUGE* unspoken subtext to this whole conflict that many people are afraid to admit. I believe that there is a large contingent of American Christians who won't admit that they believe that the people whom Israel are bombing today are getting what they deserve because they are descendants of the same people described in the Old Testament as deserving nothing but annihilation at the hands of the Israelites.\n\nMany Christians are denouncing the conflict, but why do so many support it? Do they have any reasons other than religious ones? And is their religious basis more morbid than they will readily admit?",

        "text": "I find it absolutely fascinating how a majority of the world is indoctrinated with religious beliefs.  What is very telling about this situation, is how those religious beliefs differ by geographic location, as well as by time.  If you were born in Greece 3,000 years ago, you may very well have been raised to believe Zeus was God.  Saudi Arabia today, viola, you're going to likely become a Muslim.  Each of the faithful, of all the religions, believe that they have received direction from the true God and has provided a list of rules and guidance that must be obeyed and this is indeed to be absolute, objective morality.  What follows from believing in their god, often comes the illusion that they have knowledge of some of this morality provided through their writings and that is taught and passed on to others, spreading the same way their faith as spread, word of mouth or through writings.  Having children and indoctrinating them accordingly, generation after generation.  Yet, the funny thing is, somewhere along the line that objective morality of God, changes, bends and ultimately caves in to societal pressure.  I am confident the rate of this change occurs faster today, in a smaller, connected world, through the internet, however the full effects will still remain to be seem. \n\n \n\nIn the United States, Christianity is seen as the guider of the prevalent, moral consensus through the simple fact that Christians are the majority and hold their morality from Christian teachings, indoctrination, and reading the Bible themselves, at times.  Christians argue against other morality that threatens their assumed \"moral authority\" by stating that if you do not believe in \"God\", anything goes.  Which, to some extent they do have a point.  However a disciplined, learned mind, with reason and logic on their side, can quickly conquer not only this statement, but also offer a morality that Christianity cannot obtain, a more righteous ethical system, that is based on logic and reason, aside from belief.  What we can gather, that if you are not a believer, the Bible was written by awful archaic people, with inferior morality by today's standards, who try to pawn of their morality as coming from the \"one true God\".  \n\nConsidering most of the old testament in the Western Hemisphere is seen as morally bankrupt now, we can see how obvious it is today that this objective morality has changed over years, centuries, to adapt to more sense, reason backed morality, which does have a tendency to shine through, even in  believers.  However, there is still cherry picking of morality from the old testament, currently the gay agenda is something that is objectively wrong, because \"God\" says so.  Never mind the numerous mentions to stone adulterers, or to judge not lest ye be judged, or to love one another as you love yourself.  Yet the believers fail to recognize that this morality was not of their \"God's\", but of reason.   Yet the same people claim their morality is objective and of \"God\".  The lack of understanding and logic here is astounding and when you confront someone about this, you will surely see the signs of cognitive dissonance begin bubbling over within them, with emotion and even anger rising through the words that come out.  What they fail to see, is that their morality is indeed not objective, it is believed to be.  Some of their morality is backed by their own reason, some is caused by a herd mentality, and some is due to their indoctrination. Due to the ever evolving morality of Christianity that is evidenced throughout it's history, it is obvious we have nothing close to an objective morality in Christianity, and due to its judgment based on believing god exists and believing that god told them these rules, we have a baseless morality founded upon belief, not reason, not logic, thus making this morality not only subjective, but unreasonable and irrational. \n\n \n\nThe origin of reasonable morality is through the values one holds.  Christians, holding the bible and their belief in \"God\" which somewhere along the lines gets misconstrued with a knowledge of their \"God\",  fail to understand this.  They only understand that morality comes from their god, that they believe in.. which essentially has been formed through the same way as any other religious god, who tells people what to do, through the writings of men, spread through a local culture, until the entire world has become indoctrinated.  For the origin of morality, please reference an earlier post, The Core of Humanity\nhttps://ruminationfactory.wordpress.com/2014/05/05/51/. But as alluded to earlier, reason and logic oft shine through, and that is the job of those moral, or good non believers, to provide a reasonable sound morality, based on knowledge and logic, not belief, not the writings of an immoral archaic people, who promote misogyny and stoning of adulterers, or killing those who are homosexual.  For reasons outlined above, religious morality will always be inferior to that which can be derived from logic and reason, and that is how religious morality bends to pressure of logic and reason, why Christianity evolves, and why one day, they will likely accept homosexuality.  This will be justified by something the bible says, they will claim, because Jesus loves us all, allowing them to ignore and cherry pick some more, until one day hopefully there is nothing left to ignore but the entire whole goddamn thing itself.  \n\n \n\nBe good, have a good day, and most of all, be ungodly, for the sake of humanity.

        "text": "I am now going to prove how pleasure is more important than any amount of intelligence in the world (and even atheism intelligence such as knowing scientific facts and that there is no God, etc.).  I will ask a question of whether you would choose to either be a genius with no ability to experience pleasure or be a dumb person with all the pleasure in the world.  For you to choose to be the genius and think that mere thoughts and intelligence is somehow better than feelings of love and pleasure and such, you would be wrong and delusional.  I will now prove how feelings of love and pleasure and such are far superior to mere thoughts and intelligence in this case.\n\nAs for feeling numb (no pleasure or anything), if I had the choice, I would rather have my full ability to experience pleasure and have many serious things happen to me than to feel numb with no pleasure and have no bad things happen to me at all.  I feel that living a life of no pleasure with nothing more than mere thoughts and high intelligence is the worst thing that could happen to someone.  If you had the choice to either be a genius with all the intelligence in the world with no ability to experience pleasure or be someone who is very dumb, but has all the pleasure in the world, which would you choose?  Some people might choose to be the genius.  But as for me, I would choose to be the dumb person and I am going to argue why pleasure is the most important thing here.\n \nWhen we are faced with any hardship in life, we rely on our ability to experience pleasure to get us through in life.  For example, someone with a physical condition would say something to his/herself such as \"I may have this debilitating condition, but at least I am still able to enjoy my life.\"  However, when you have your ability to experience pleasure taken away, that would be the worst thing.\n \nAlso, if you had the choice to either experience a feeling of love or pleasure towards someone or something or to just simply experience nothing more than a thought of pleasure or love towards that person or thing, which would you choose?  I'm quite sure you would choose to experience a feeling of love or pleasure which proves here that feelings are far superior to mere thoughts and intelligence in this case.  Therefore, in regards to my question as to whether I would be a genius or a dumb person, I (and others here) should obviously choose to be the dumb person since feelings of love and pleasure are far superior to any amount of intelligence (intelligence being nothing more than mere thoughts and awareness).\n\nFinally, I wish to feel superior to reality by embracing fantasy and feeling empowered by fantasy as well as through the delusion that there is a God and an afterlife.  But my intelligence (atheism) has prevented me from being this person I want to be.  Which is why I hate such intelligence and view fantasy and feelings of pleasure as superior.  All that matters in life to me is embracing feelings of pleasure from god-like fantasy which would make me a mystical god-like being who is superior to reality (so to speak, not literally speaking).  So all that matters to me is being a superior god-like being in a sense and ending all things inferior in my life.  To me, struggles in life, depression, and the fact that there is no God or afterlife are all inferior things to me and must die.  So by believing in a God and an afterlife, I would have \"killed\" this inferior concept of there being no God and afterlife in a sense (including any feelings of depression as well).  Feeling empowered and that I'm all great is the only thing that matters to me in life (not in comparison to other people, but in comparison to myself and reality itself).",

Also, my mom is REALLY dragging me around with religion by making me talk to a guy of religion. My dad keeps saying i have no soul(which is true because i'm an atheist, and i don't believe in \"souls\") but he believes my kindness is the work of God, which is false, i'm being kind for just my sake of being nice to others, not because of some religious idol people believe in. I also am pretty annoyed when my grandmother would follow me around telling me these \"gifts of God\" (although I can't fully blame her because of her mental instability) and just tell me to pray every single time, then my dad would just mock me on why atheism is bad, then my mom would just yell at me and make me read the Bible(which has some false accusations) and it's just really explodes a lot of times, I really can't argue with them or settle a talk with them because they would yell at me at a moment's notice, and if I try to argue with them, and I prove my points, my parents would repeat the subject over and over and over again like a repeated record. My sister would just yell at me and be on my parents' side just because they are her parents.\nI did tell them I \"believed\" in God, but it still didn't work because my grandmother would forget the statement and ask why I hate God(which I can't hate anything I don't believe in) so I just walk away from that, but my dad and mom will just be so stubborn and my dad would be up to my face with religion (literally) my mom would just keep making me read the Bible, then my little sister would just yell at me repeatedly.\nSo I know that talking to them is out, and trying to \" believe\" is out, so any other options. Note I'm 15 so under law I can't drive out nor move out my parents' house either. So please any suggestions on what I should do with the situation. Thank you so much.",

        "text": "I feel like things are snowballing on my way to disbelief, despite not wanting it to and still trying to fight it.  I spent some time today reflecting on what I have viewed over the years as evidences, proofs, and other reasons upon which to rest my conviction to Islam.  I will simply present some of them and actually comment on some of them.\n\n1) Belief in a Creator: The idea of a Creator has always made a lot of sense to me, based on arguments such as the idea of a [first cause](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_cause) and the [Kalam Cosmological Argument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalam_cosmological_argument).  Related to this is the [argument from fitra](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/135chi/?sort=old) which has always resonated with me rather well, especially when one considers the evidence that people do naturally tend to believe in God ([here](http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/05/12/religious-belief-is-human-nature-huge-new-study-claims/)). Of course, that doesn't validate the existence of God as described in Islam.\n\n2) [Tawheed/strict monotheism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tawheed): Building off of #1, since I was convinced that there was some sort of First Cause/Creator, a God with such attributes made the most sense to fit with that.\n\n3) Debates: As a kid, watching [Ahmed Deedat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Deedat) defeat Christians in debates emboldened my faith.  How could a man who lacked much formal education (Islamic or secular) and didn't know Arabic, Hebrew, or Greek consistently dismantle the best arguments made in defense of Christianity (the other major faith, as I viewed it) and thoroughly refute any criticisms his opponents hurled at Islam?  The victory could have only been from God.\n\nLater, Muslim debaters seemed to do a good job of consistently out-debating their atheist and anti-religious opponents who often brought criticisms of religion based primarily on Christianity to the debates, leaving them vulnerable to counters from Islamic sources that they lacked familiarity with.\n\nOf course, looking at it now, whether a Muslim won or lost a debate really shouldn't have done anything to strengthen or weaken my faith.\n\n4) Scientific facts in the Qur'an and Hadith: The contents of [The Bible, the Qu'ran and Science by Maurice Bucaille](http://www.amazon.com/dp/187940298X) were what I almost always fell back on when I struggled in my faith.  More than that, scientific facts in the Qur'an and Hadiths (and even this book) were used by me as late as 2011 to make the case for Islam to non-Muslims.\n\nOf course, this has become increasingly problematic as time went on, as even [Hamza Tzortzis now acknowledges](http://www.hamzatzortzis.com/does-the-quran-contain-scientific-miracles-a-new-approach/).\n\n5) Completion of revelation argument: [Qur'an 5:48](http://www.quran.com/5/48) established Islam as the \"criterion\" over that which came before (and by extension that which comes after/from outside of Islam, since [Qur'an 5:3](http://www.quran.com/5/3) establishes Islam as the completion of revelation).  Additionally, the Islamic position that thousands of Prophets (beyond the ones mentioned in the Qur'an and the Hadiths or in the previously scriptures which were divinely inspired before corruption) helped strengthen this for me.  Any similarities to Islamic practices in pre-Islamic areas or scriptures were easily explained as actually validating the Islamic position, since these were remnants of the pure messages that the Prophets delivered to various peoples around the world who had since corrupted them (see [Qur'an 16:36](http://www.quran.com/16/36), [Qur'an 40:78](http://www.quran.com/40/78)).\n\n6) Specific Hadiths and Qur'anic Verses: [Sahih Muslim Book 42, Hadith 7058](http://www.sunnah.com/urn/270580), [Sunan Ibn Majah Book 36, Hadith 3986](http://www.sunnah.com/urn/1290860).  Honestly, as I write this, I'm realizing that these two Hadiths and how they seem to explain why certain things in the world are as they are play(/played?) a huge part in strengthening my convictions.  [Here](http://www.sunnah.com/urn/1250120), there seems to me to be a description of the [Hadith rejectors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quranism) of today.\n\nRelated to that is the idea that the Qur'an says that people will be tested. See [Qur'an 29:2-3](http://www.quran.com/29/2-3), [Qur'an 2:155-156](http://www.quran.com/2/155-156), and [this Hadith](http://www.sunnah.com/urn/270580). No promises or guarantees are made to humans about earthly, worldly happiness. I once heard a speaker explain that God tests us to allow us to turn to Him, and that perhaps those who are tested the most is those whom God most wants to have turn to Him; if considered next to Islam's rigid, foundational concept of [Tawheed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tawhid) upon which it is then built that humans are only on earth to be tested and to worship God, it makes sense to me, even if a person doesn't like that or agree with it. What is promised to humans in Islam is that if humans maintain their faith and trust in God, He will see to it that we are on the right path that leads to heaven. Another way of thinking about it is that those who have better earthly lives will probably not even be able to appreciate the amazing wonders of paradise in the next life to the same extent that a person with a difficult earthly life will be able to. [Another Hadith](http://quotesofislam.blogspot.com/2010/08/3-persons-whose-dua-is-not-rejected.html) tells us that the prayers of an oppressed person are not rejected. When in hardship, it can be seen as an opportunity to pray for that which is wanted and needed most. That said, such an idea necessitates trust in God in order to understand that prayers are accepted in the best possible way, which rests upon an acceptance of [Tawheed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tawhid).\n\nDuring my last spiritual crisis, it was these ideas that I came back to that eventually kept me believing in Islam.\n\nPlease feel free to comment on anything I've written above and pick at it further.\n\n&gt; Previous threads:\n&gt;\n&gt;I think I just had an epiphany that will prove fatal to my faith.... - [http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/2azqw6/?sort=old](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/2azqw6/?sort=old)\n&gt;\n&gt;Struggling Muslim here.

I think Douglas Adams books would be great to pass out as well, as some are more receptive to ideas wrapped in fiction. Daniel Dennett, Sam Harris, and Christopher Hitchens are also obvious choices.",

They're emotionally attached to their predetermined positions, and when their positions (God exists, or God created the world in six days) are challenged by evidence, they're motivated to create new rebuttals to protect their position, even when they're obviously wrong, hence the term motivated reasoning.\n\nAn entertaining example of motivated reasoning is the antics of Ken Ham, who has his Creationism museum with people riding dinosaurs, as if the Flintstones was a documentary. You could tell him the facts of evolution until you're blue in the face, but you're not going to persuade him. See the debate between him and Bill Nye...\n\nObviously, this affects us as atheists - we promote the use of logic and reason, based on measurable facts, and healthy skepticism, but this bit of psychology means that religious people that we argue with aren't going to listen to basic facts. It also affects other areas in politics - look at global climate change deniers.\n\nOr look at the birthers claiming that President Obama is a Kenyan Muslim Marxist Fascist Manchurian Traitor President. They demanded his birth certificate. He provided it. They demanded the \"long form\". He provided it. You can also find the birth announcements of Obama's birth in Honolulu's newspaper archives, and get accounts from people who were there. But the evidence doesn't change the birthers minds. They just revise their conspiracy theories and make them more elaborate.\n\nI can dig around and find a lot of articles online on motivated reasoning, and even lots of academic journal articles.\n\nThe one thing I can't find is effective tactics to deal with motivated reasoning. Some people are just so far gone, like Ken Ham that they're unpersuadable. But there are other people who aren't quite so set in their ways. I'm looking for ways to persuade, that can be effective when a person reacts to facts he doesn't like with motivated reasoning.\n\nAny ideas or experiences?",

        "text": "More than a few believers in my acquaintance see our using “god” with a lowercase “g” as a petulant snub. It’s after all, not as though the capital “G” necessarily authenticates the concept. I have to defend the use of the capital “G” in *some* instances, and given the many barriers between us and believers, I do actually think this is important.\n\nIt’s perfectly acceptable to use a lowercase “g” when discussing a particular god as a common noun or “the gods” or even the concept of “god” (though it’s less common to see this). There are, however, instances in which the word “god” is used as a title, in place of a name like “Yahweh” or “Allah” as a proper noun. In such instances, we should use the same rules we apply to words like “mom” and “dad.” \n\n“His mom went to the store.”\n\n“Yesterday, Mom wondered where you were.”\n\n“OP’s mom is hot.”\n\n“Hey, OP’s mom, I had a great time last night! May I call you ‘Mom’?”\n\nSo when we are referencing scripture, for example, we should say, “In Jeremiah, God blah blah blah…” because we are using the title in place of the name. No, titles do not always function this way, but they certainly do when they are standing in for the person’s name (ex. Hey, Boss, can you look at this?)! \n\nThe lowercase “g” is *at times* improper, not to mention distracting, and off-putting/confusing to many people. I personally go one step further. In the event that I’ve already made it clear that I’m discussing “the god of the Bible,” I carry on in the uppercase, referring to the Christian god using his title, “God.”\n\nI’m not trying to split hairs. This has come up *a number* of times in conversation with those who think we’re using every opportunity to take cheap hits at the Lord of Hosts, who is also Christ. Praise Him (No, please don’t start capitalizing “Him.” That’s stupid. ). \n",

We have now seen in this Aaronid written text, the Priestly source, “Yahweh” endorse:\n\n    *the sole selection of the Aaronids as his priests, while at the same time demoting the rest of the Levites to servants of the Aaronids—contradictory to the claims of the “Yahweh” of Deuteronomy (#152)\n    *the sole right of the Aaronids to officiate sacrifices, which logically follows from the above (#149)\n    *and therefore the sole right of the Aaronids alone to expiate/atone for sin and only through sacrifices (#174, #244)\n    *the sole right of the Aaronids to enter the Tabernacle (#166, #231)\n    *the sole right of the Aaronids alone to touch Yahweh’s holy sacra (#220)\n    *the sole selection of Aaronid priests as judges (#153-154)\n    *the sole right of the Aaronids to be able to eat Yahweh’s sacrifices (#177)\n    *the sole right of the Aaronids as the beneficiaries of Yahweh’s tithes (#214)\n    *and now the sole right to burn incense!\n\n&gt;This pro-Aaronid legislation is just some of the data scholars use in determining, quite convincingly now, that this literature was written by an elite priestly guild that legitimated its sovereign right to rule by tracing its lineage back to Aaron and, not surprisingly, by writing a text set in the archaic past where the Yahweh in this text authenticated their sole right to be priests and to rule by proclaiming it so!\n\n&gt;Again for readers unfamiliar with ancient Near Eastern literature—and that is most “readers” of the Bible—this is precisely what ancient literature did and was composed to do.

My parents would always tell me to have faith in god and that he will always be there for us whenever we need him. We seldom go to church and pray the rosary. \n\nAs I arrived in Norway, it was the same as it was back home. We had a small community where we had youth meetings, bible sharing, mass on Sundays etc. Homesickness was not the problem anymore. After a year as I was researching for catholicism on the internet, I could read that it was a false religion and that it is a scam. Apparently, it was Christianity which is the one true religion. It was because they didn't have doctrines and contradictions of the bible(i.e.worshiping false idols). It made sense that time so I confronted a cousin about this topic. He was furious saying that I shouldn't falter at all. That what I believed in made no sense. He told me that catholicism is the only religion that I should believe in. The discussion ended up into insulting me for questioning my beliefs. I decided to stick to christianity for that. \n\nAfter a year, I met my SO in class. She is intelligent and beautiful. We dated the same year and she said yes to be my girlfriend. I still remember it clearly when we had a conversation about religion. She said that it was absurd to believe in one. I responded: \"Humans don't come from monkeys.\" That was the most embarassing thing I said yet I did. She still keeps teasing me about how I said it firmly. It showed how ignorant I am of other things. I've become open-minded to other things and see it without any bias. I found Atheism shortly after that.\n\nIt was then I realized that religion is not what I think it is. It doesn't shape me to be a good person, it was myself that did that. I don't depend upon the lord for forgiveness nor help anymore. I am responsible for my own action. It made me a better person. \n\nHowever, my mother found out about it and will occasionally confront me about why I don't believe in god anymore. I just reply, \"Because it is not who I am.\" She would be agitated by my response and say, \"What would your grandmother think about you?\" This is where it gets complicated because my grandmother is my closest relative to me. She taught me how to be a better person. Soon we will going home back to my country for good. Mother keeps asking me what would I say to her if she asked why I don't believe in god anymore. Worst case scenario is that I lose someone I love because of it and I might be sent off to live on my own.\n\nI want to know how to approach this kind of sensitive topic especially when I'm going to live back in my country. I'm clueless on how to deal with this as it might backfire on me and regret it forever. \n\nTldr;5 years in another country made me less ignorant about everything. Mother confronts me about being a non-believer. Asks about what would I say to my grandmother who is my closest relative since I was a kid.",

I know that he was intrigued by eastern religions but, because we are a western born mormon family, these eastern concepts are way too foreign to really sit with long and a return to comfort is the normal course of action.  \n\nThe same goes for agnosticism or atheism.  The concept of God or the christian God not existing in the way that you were conditioned to believe is frightening.  I know because I was there.  Accepting an atheist viewpoint was honestly one of the most frightening things for my young mormon post mission self.

More of a true history of all religions.  I believe if he had a historical view of world religions that he would be intrigued and see a clear progression to the modern Mormon religion that was made.  In a way I want to show that Christianity is just as man made as Mormonism just older.",

        "author": "Neikea-",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/2biur1/entheogens_and_perennial_philosophy/",
        "text": "This topic has come before in the \"[Entheogen Theory of Religion](http://www.thinkatheist.com/forum/topics/the-entheogen-theory-of-religion?)\" and \"[McKenna](http://www.thinkatheist.com/forum/topics/the-junk-science-of-terrence-mckenna?)\" threads at \"ThinkAtheist.com\". The entheogen theory of religion is espoused by Michael Hoffman which he elucidates at this website \"[EgoDeath.com](http://www.egodeath.com/)\". However, there is another similar theory which says that these type of experiences are at the very root of religion as in Aldous Huxley's \"[Perennial Philosophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Perennial_Philosophy),\" which implies that the ingestion of psychedelics may not have been the sole route to inducing a \"mystical experience\" as Michael Hoffman believes and Terence McKenna initially thought as well. Has anyone read \"The Doors of Perception\"?\n\nAldous Huxley makes a reference there to a Perennial Philosophy which he espouses as the original root of religion which has its basis in colossal altered states of consciousness. If you scratch all of the major religions, you'll find human beings, just as human as you and I, engaging in altered states of consciousness.\n\nI'll take the example of eastern religion, for instance. What I've sort of come to realize in thinking about all of this is that even though some people may call themselves Buddhist or Hindu, they may have taken upon this label in the same way a Christian has inherited his/her religion through tradition, a set of parents, a geographical area, etc. Likewise, there are people in India whose religion is bestowed upon them in the very same way. However, it was once said by the Buddha that the number of people who've experienced \"[nirvana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana)\" or the \"[mystical experience](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystical_experience#Classical_definitions)\" can be counted on the fingers of one hand. That's not meant to be taken literally, but to give an idea of how rare this happening occurs when it comes about naturally. Someone who has had this experience of \"nirvana\" could then see through the various misconceptions surrounding the religion, and what I'm implying here is that most people who call themselves Buddhist or Hindu have, most likely, not had this religious experience.\n\nNow, you may stop and think, \"What you wrote seems a variation of the comment they are not really believers and so therefore I disown them and remove them from the group.\"\n\nI can see how it may seem that way, sort of like a \"No true Scotsman\" informal fallacy. However, I will point out that this is in no way a No True Scotsman fallacy, because what must be understood is that this state of mind which is striven for in Hinduism or Buddhism are transcendent of the religions themselves, because it's ultimately a phenomenon in consciousness that anyone, despite their religious background or lack thereof, has the potential for. I mention this because the very goal of these religions and all sects of Buddhism is essentially one and the same thing. It is an altered state of mind in which this insight manifests. Some monks spend their entire lives practicing disciplines in order to attain this insight, and I'd even wager many have died without ever approaching it, and perhaps they receive it at death. I want to make this distinction quite clear, because if you have had this insight, then suddenly all the misconceptions surrounding your religion become clearly transparent and therefore could be disregarded. So, each unique sect of Buddhism, if you look into the matter, you'll find are simply a variety of disciplines which each aim towards the same goal. As one guru put it, \"Paths are many, truth is one.\" \n\nSo, this is not anything at all like Christians and Jehovah's witnesses arguing as to which religion is the \"correct interpretation,\" because unlike these religions, Buddhism does not espouse such concepts to be muddled, misinterpreted, misconstrued, handed down from generation to generation to be twisted, misremembered and so forth and so on. What the western religious churches are peddling is high abstraction, a series of concepts which require you to believe based on \"faith,\" and so their whole notion of reality is heavily distorted into these various concepts, and each Christian or Jehovah's witness then understands their religion through the lens of their own individual [eisegesis](http://www.answers.com/topic/eisegesis).\n\nNow, Buddhism, on the other hand, is based not on a series of concepts but an experience. A phenomenon in consciousness that can potentially happen to anyone. It is not a \"personal experience,\" because although this phenomenon is often spoken about in religious terms and given labels such as \"[samadhi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samadhi),\" \"[satori](http://www.answers.com/topic/satori),\" or \"[nirvana](http://www.answers.com/topic/nirvana),\" it is often described as an \"impersonal experience\" or a \"transpersonal experience\" because there are motifs or universal themes within this peculiar experience that are not reducible to the individual. So, then you see although someone might call themself a Buddhist or Hindu this doesn't necessarily mean that they have had the \"insight\" which after all is the very goal of these religions. So, by this distinction, you could say that Siddartha Gautama was not a Buddhist, but a Buddha. Buddha, as you may know, is the title given to anyone who has \"[awakened](http://www.answers.com/topic/buddha#Awakening)\" or has been \"[enlightened](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_(spiritual\\)).\"\n\n\nYou know, Buddhists don't go around in the fashion of Jehovah's witnesses telling people they \"ought to believe.\" The point I was trying to make is that the goal of Buddhism is an experience in which you can have for yourself so you don't have to quibble over concepts inside a book. It's when you have to rely on a series of ideas that things can become vague, misconstrued, and this then leads to a vast array of misconception.\n\nNow, you might be thinking, \"What the hell is a mystical experience, anyway?! This sounds a lot like the Christian who tells people God is real because they feel god inside them.\"\n\nI admit, it does sound a lot like that, and I constantly have to make clear distinctions, because if you have not had the experience, then you have no way of interpreting it. Of course, I realize that most people, atheists and theists alike, have probably not have had an experience like this. If you have not had the experience, then you're like Freud in his response to Romain Rolland when he couldn't find any reason to believe that such an experience exists because he could not find it within himself, and so the \"oceanic feeling\" Rolland mentioned to him only appeared as a footnote in two of Freud's books. The experience by its very nature seems to exceed the very limits of one's expectations and understanding. So, you see, if you have not had this experience, then you are, in a way, intellectually set-up to doubt such an experience exists in the first place, and most people don't realize this possibility in consciousness exists. So, I want to make it clear that this is not like when a Christian says, \"I feel God in my heart,\" the sort of comment which prompts Matt Dillahunty to retort, \"Well, maybe you should go see a doctor.\" In other words, I agree, you don't want to metaphysicize heartburn. Now, what I'm referring to is a tried-and-true phenomenon that isn't necessarily associated with religion, but has over the years become intertwined. It is a phenomenon in consciousness. I believe religions like Hinduism and Buddhism have surrounded themselves around this phenomenon. \n\nNow, I agree that the Christian might be basing a kind of metaphysical aspect to a subtle or vague feeling that he or she has, but I wouldn't compare this phenomenon to that. As I mentioned before, it doesn't necessarily have to do with a religion. More contemporarily, it has been written about in terms of \"[ego death](http://www.answers.com/topic/ego-death)\" in the psychedelic community, the Teilhardian \"[Omega Point](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_Point),\" \"[Cosmic Consciousness](http://www.answers.com/topic/richard-bucke#Cosmic_consciousness_experience)\" as described by Richard M. Bucke, \"[peak experience](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_experience)\" in the writings of Abraham Maslow, \"[collective unconscious](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_unconscious)\" in Jungian terminology, the \"[oceanic feeling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_feeling)\" by Romain Rolland in his letter to Sigmund Freud, and so forth and so on. This is something that if you were to experience it, you'd know without an iota of doubt that what you were experiencing was orders of magnitude different from your ordinary consciousness.\n\nThe rest of this post will continue on the first two posts of this thread. \"[Click here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/2biur1/entheogens_and_perennial_philosophy#cj5qpqt)\" to go to the next portion of this post.",

Raised fundamentalist Christian, I'm pretty well versed in old testament history, and can't help but notice that a good portion of the old and new testament is a history of a small nation getting wrecked by Egyptians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, Romans, then later the Arabs, Mongols, Turks, etc., which makes me wonder how anyone could ever think god ever blessed them with a land that basically served as a grounds for massacre and slavery. I know a lot of atheists have criticized Judeo-Christian morality for being the enforced submissive morality of the conqueror upon the conquered, but when this conflict that reemerges every few years, that morality seems to go out the window. Have any of you dealt with kind of thinking with Christian or moderate to nonreligious Jewish friends? I'm in a fraternity with a good amount of Jews in it, several having done the birthright itself, and the level of Zionism goes through the roof when the news covers this.",

        "text": "I volunteer in STEM education outreach through the local section of my professional society.  I was recently invited to be part of a working group, with the goal of better utilizing the STEM professionals in our community within our schools.  While reading through the initial discussion notes for this group (I missed the first meeting) I noticed frequent mention of engaging faith based communities to support their volunteers, invitations for clergy to take part, and a suggestion that it would be an opportunity for clergy to answer questions about their faith.\n\nI replied to the organizer that while I was interested in working with the group, that \"I am a bit concerned by the suggestion in this summary that clergy would be using STEM education outreach to answer questions about their faith.  That seems rather out of place.\"  I think they are well intentioned, and certainly want to be a part of this group, but I wanted to respectfully lay out my concerns from the get go.  The response I got stunk of what my boyfriend described as \"don't discriminate against my right to discriminate\" logic: \"Volunteers can have all sorts of motives and they need to be accepted as valid for that volunteer, including faith-based ones, as long as the volunteer follows whatever rules are established for that situation - would you object to a Christian (or Jew or Muslim) who belongs to *** being precluded from talking about how their faith is relevant to their membership in the nuclear profession in a STEM Ed outreach activity in a Christian (or Jewish, or Muslim) private school?  I think not, I think that you would find that bigoted.\"\n\nI responded with \"I would not “preclude” anybody from expressing their personal opinions at an event, at a religious school or otherwise.  However I certainly would not encourage, or plan a discussion that’s not at all relevant to STEM education at a STEM education event, regardless of where that event was taking place.  That’s my personal opinion, and I’m sure the working group will have others.  I just wanted to express my initial concern.\"\n\nAm I out of line?  On the one hand, I can see how having the faith based community behind us, instead of against us, can be a huge advantage.  I can see that there might be students who are hesitant to accept science because they are taught at home that the bible is literal truth, and having members of the faith community talk to them about how science and religion can co-exist might be helpful.  I'm happy if the working group wants to organize those specific sort of discussions for private schools, or outside of school events, but I do NOT think they should be sharing the stage with people who are there with the only goal of STEM education.\n\nAny thoughts on how I can best communicate this to the working group?  I am sure this topic will be brought up again.",

I know this topic is still young, but I have high hopes that all of our atheist bookworms will provide some great choices.\n\nOne of the many functions of fiction literature is to provide a reader with a unique point of view on a subject that he may have not encountered before. What better way to give a believer (or ourselves) a unique perspective than an accessible story? While r/atheism has a list of selected non-fiction reading, there isn't really a list of recommended fiction. One of the biggest problems with providing non-fiction literature to someone who does not share your viewpoint is that they may not objectively evaluate the material, and may even be pushed further into close-mindedness or disagreement. Fiction is a great way of providing a point of view on real world topics without being so overt about it. Plus, reading fiction is a nice change of pace from time to time if you're used to reading a ton of nonfiction stuff.\n\nNow I'm not trying to get ahead of myself here, but it is my hope that with the help of reddit's voting system, the users of r/trueatheism can vote the best atheist-related fiction to the top. This way, not only do we have a list of nonfiction books that we can provide to believers, or read ourselves (the list can be found on the r/atheism subreddit), but we may also have a list of fiction books that we can read or provide to believers to more subtly engage critical thought.",

        "text": "The Christian idea of baraminology seems to say that \"kinds\" are life forms which can breed with each other and produce viable offspring (so for example a wolf and a dog are the same \"kind\" because they can reproduce together, but a dog and a bear are not), and that evolution can never change an animal from one \"kind\" into another \"kind\". But we have direct, reproducible evidence that this is violated in the existence of ring species: a ring species is a connected series of neighbouring populations, each of which can interbreed with closely sited related populations, but for which there exist at least two \"end\" populations in the series, which are too distantly related to interbreed. Several living examples of these exist today. So that means that a species can evolve into something which can no longer mate with something the original species can still sexually reproduce with. \n\nThe Bible never explains what it means by the word \"kind\", even though it is a very important pillar of creationism. But in real life, there is absolutely no evidence for any barrier to how much a population can change over time. In reality, any gene is subject to descent with modification, and there is no limit to the extent of that modification. What you're claiming is that at some point these modifications must somehow hit a wall, that after a certain number of changes they must suddenly stop. If that were the case we would see a bunch of species which have hit this wall and which have stopped changing: their offspring would look exactly like their parents even on a microscopic level, but there is absolutely no evidence for this.",

She hasn't been to church seriously in the past 15 years, aside from the occasional wedding.  She has stated that she \"feels detached from the church\", but also that she still holds her faith.  Her mother and father are devout catholics who attend mass several times a week and are very involved in the church community.  Obviously they are pushing for a wedding in the church.  \n\nI was raised jewish and have been atheist for over ten years now, though her family is not yet aware of it.  \n\nShe is not so sure if she wants it herself, but admits that if it wasn't for my wishes, it would likely be in the church because of her parents.\n\nI'm trying to be tolerant and not raise a stink, but it's making me very uncomfortable as I read more about what the catholic church requires for a mixed faith marriage.  It sounds like I'll have to stand on a stage, pray to a god I do not acknowledge, and promise to raise my future children in the faith.  \n\nI'm wondering if anyone else here has been involved in something similar and could offer words of advice.  I'm worried I'm being unreasonable by refusing, and I really don't want to make an enemy of her parents.  But at the same time, to go through with it would be to lie to the faces of hundreds of friends and family about my intentions with my future children and my faith, and I am not willing to do that.\n\nKeep in mind this is all in the very early stages.  I plan to meet with a priest and get a full briefing on what would happen before making any decisions.\n\nedit: I should also mention that I'm also not keen on the idea of contributing financially to an organization I find morally repugnant.\n\nedit 2: Some good stuff in here.  Thanks guys.  I just want to say that I'm not willing to assume that these people are kidnappers or crazy.  We don't agree on whether or not there is a floating sky man watching over us, but aside from that these are very normal, very nice, and very caring people, who would never wish me harm nor try to split up a child from its father.  I want to understand the intricacies of an atheist marrying in the church, not hear horror stories about lunatics who happen to be religious.  I do sympathize though.  That sucks terribly.\n\nedit 3: It seems clear to me that the #1 suggestion is to sit down with her and her parents and lay everything on the table.  Many people would like me to \"hold my ground\".  I don't plan on being contentious from the get go.  I'm going to tell them my beliefs and my concerns, and state that while I am accepting of a catholic priest, I do not want to be married in a church.  Beyond that, and maybe at a later point, we will go over the finer details of how we're going to raise our children if we have them.  Thanks for the input guys.\n\nedit 4: I talked to her this evening.  Her and her mother had a long conversation about my beliefs and my feelings on the church.  Her mother accepts that we will not be marrying in a catholic church.  My fiance still wants a catholic priest (friend of the family) to officiate, which unfortunately means pre canan.  I think I can suffer through that.  I will be speaking to a priest and letting him know exactly what I am and am not willing to do during the service.  I think it's a fair compromise.  We still have lots of talking to do about if/how we will be raising children, but I'm a lot more hopeful now.",

They yield poor results or they cause an additional problem. In these cases scientists, engineers, medical doctors, etc. must redo their work. I have a friend who is a bacteriology grad student who has lost many evenings to a protein not crystallizing because conditions weren't maintained correctly. If a structural engineer cuts corners, bridges fall and have to be rebuilt.  There is a whole field or law that deals with occasions when real doctors make careless mistakes.\n\nFeats of pseudoscience don't operate like this. I've never heard of a priest or rabbi who made his congregation start a service over because a step was missed. I've never heard of an acupuncturist taking all the pins out and starting from scratch. I don't think they've ever had to throw away a vat of homeopathic remedy for failing quality standards. \n\nWhat I mean by all this is that, moving forward, I think a good indicator of whether something is real or not is to imagine the consequence if it were done incorrectly, and under what circumstances it would need to be re-done.

Ignostic - I tend to dislike discussions about \"god\" because there isn't really a clear, precise definition affixed to the word \"god.\" Thus, debating or discussing it is futile.\n\n2. Apatheistic - If you are familiar with [*One Piece*](http://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece), think Roronoa Zoro. I simply don't care about the existence of a god, even after the term's been defined. I feel like concerning oneself with the existence (or lack thereof) of god is, again, futile.\n\n3. Agnostic - I *will* believe in a **deity** if there is SCIENTIFIC proof confirming so. (I'm open mined - wiling to believe - but only after there is concrete evidence.)\n\n4. Atheist - If \"god\" is the \"creator\" or \"ultimate being\" then I believe that such a being cannot exist. However, if \"god\" is some kind of \"alien\" who is still confined to the laws of the universe, but is somehow superior to a human, either physically or mentally, or something, then sure, I might believe it. See number 3 above. (But I guess that doesn't really count as a god then, huh? Even \"deity\" is pushing it.)\n\nSo if you consider all of that, would \"ignostic apatheistic agnostic atheist\" be a valid description, or is there something more accurate to describe me?

Not because of the debate that followed, not because of anyone trouncing on it, (which is fair game when that happens), nor have I become convinced that the article was inherently incorrect.\n\nI’ve removed it because its tone is outside my belief that respect is an essential ingredient in the religion-science debate.  \n\nI’ve been wondering, ‘How did I fall off the respect wagon?’   How did I drift from my commitment to my principles?\n\nWhen I first watched Tyson on TV and read a couple of his interviews, my first reaction was “Wow!”  But then a friend and I noticed inconsistencies in his public persona, things that put up a red flag.  My friend challenged me, as a journalist, to dig into that.  The discrepancies shouted loudest at the point of whether or not he’s an atheist.  That seemed to be the place to learn more about him.\n\nAs I collected 38 pages of links and excerpts, I became increasingly disturbed.  I started to see a man who is angry, who thinks irrationally, is disrespectful to those who oppose his point of view and yet is strongly driven to change public thinking to fully match his own.  That energy can work for us where we agree with him, but I’ve started to see that he’s not being honest about his whole agenda.  And yet he has the charm and presence to sway audiences. \n\nI’m posting the quotes and links from my article at the bottom of this note, but this retraction is not about swaying your opinion.  \n\nI’m more concerned that, after I was immersed in deGrasse Tyson and his campaigns, I found it harder and harder to maintain respect for him.  I lost my commitment to acknowledge other people for their position and the way their standpoint can help us all forward.   \n\nAnd that’s the problem with disrespect.  It’s contagious.  I got caught in that net.  \n\nIf there is any key to the religion-science debate, its’ learning how to treat each other with consideration while having our own concerns addressed.  Freeman Dyson has taught me, in his example and in what little exchange I’ve had with him, the power of respect.  It’s a hefty tool in resolving conflict.  A moment of true respect, of someone listening to understand you, of someone hearing you to work with you, has an incredible power to heal and to solve discord.  \n\nMy article did not do that.  It falls outside my personal goals and the purposes of the Shastra Project.  So I’ve removed it.  \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe quotes and links from the article.  I include them here not to make point but, if you want opportunity to join the previous discussion and make a rebuttal, you should have them.  \n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n“.. two days after I appeared on the Daily Show with Jon Stewart I thought, let me add that to my wiki page. I went there, and the link was already up. (The days of anonymity are long gone.) So I’m looking at the page and it says, “Neil deGrasse Tyson, a long-time atheist…” and I thought, where did that come from? I never said that. So I removed it and I put in “agnostic” because I think, based on all the folks who are agnostic historically, I come closer to the behavior of an agnostic than the behavior of an atheist. Three days later it was back to atheist. Then I learned that there are people who want to equate agnosticism with atheism. So I went back in, thinking I needed to be clever about this, and I changed the phrase to: “widely claimed by atheists, he is actually an agnostic.”\n\n “The more I learn about the universe, the less convinced I am that there's any sort of benevolent force that has anything to do with it, at all.” – Neil deGrasse Tyson\n\n “God is an ever receding pocket of scientific ignorance.” - Neil deGrasse Tyson\n (http://aattp.org/neil-degrasse-tyson-tells-moyers-no-religion-in-science-classrooms-video/)   \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTOzeO-nz2A\nBeyond Belief Conference, in San Diego in November of 2006:\n\n“I want to put on the table, not why 85% of the members of the National Academy of Sciences reject God, I want to know why 15% of the National Academy don’t.

        "text": "If you listened to him talking, you could almost feel convinced yourself. I understand the basics of evolution and the current accepted model of the universe, but I do not know the full details. The person I talked to today broke down physics and chemistry and called himself a critical thinker and challenged me to \"think for myself and not accept science so blindly.\" Here are some points he brought up:\n\n1. Light is not constant. He argued that what we witness today does not mean it has always been that way. He says that light has most likely slowed way dramatically, meaning the stars are probably not as far away as we think they are. \n\n2. He divided time into two periods - pre-flood and post-flood. He said the great flood occurred 4,600 years ago. He argued that the flood most likely contributed to all fossils today. \n\n3. He said Neanderthals were most likely humans that adapted to their environment in the way skin color changes. He said it only takes 12-30 generation for adaptations to occur. He also said Neanderthal DNA is different from ours by a meaningless 0.075%, meaning that they are as close to us as you are to any other human on Earth.\n\n4. He dismissed the fossil record as carbon dating is only accurate up to 54,000 years old and everything we have found today shows it is not that old. He said we use circular reasoning when we date fossils because we use the soil around the fossils to determine the age, then use the fossils to determine the age of the soil. \n\n5. He used the classic argument of how we have never observed any *kind* of animal evolving into any other *kind* of animal, only that animals of the same kind have adapted to their environments. \n\n6. He also said that our closest living relative is 5% different in DNA...I thought it was only 1% different?\n\n7. He believes that the world pre-flood was different in atmospheric pressure, much different. He said that this led to humans 10-15 feet  tall, lives much longer, animals much larger (such as dinosaurs), and plants much larger. He believes dinosaurs and man co-existed.\n\n8. He said that Chinese ancient literature talks about \"dragons\" (the word for dinosaurs before they were called dinosaurs) and that an emperor kept one as a pet - and that it's all recorded. \n\n9. He believed that pre-flood humans lived so long that they developed an intense understanding of the world and potentially were technologically advanced enough to build aircraft. He said ancient civilizations have pictures of airplanes, helicopters, and light bulbs. He said that this information was likely passed on to civilizations post-flood by Noah's ancestors. \n\n10. As the world's atmospheric pressure lowered to what it is today, there was a decline in animal size and life length. \n\n11. He believes the Smithsonian has skeletons of giant humans that prove that humans used to be larger, and that they are keeping it a secret. \n\n12. He believes a few dinosaurs may exist in the Congo today, and that the Loch Ness may be a dinosaur as well.\n\n13. He also believes that the scientific community is groomed to disregard any evidence contrary to what is the popular accepted theory today and that anything not supporting evolution will not be published. I argued that if you could prove any of this, or disprove evolution, you would win a Nobel prize among other things. He said it would never happen because scientists' religion is science or atheism, and they defend it \"religiously.\" \n\nI had a lot of questions and didn't believe anything he was saying. Once he started saying dinosaurs were still alive and pre-flood humans could have had the power of flight, I couldn't believe what I was hearing. \n\nHe was very knowledgeable, is a former math teacher, has two university degrees (not from some Christian college either), and knew the \"science\" behind what he was talking about. \n\nIf I were to have this conversation again, how could I convince this \"scientific\" man that what he is saying is absurd and that the scientific community is in no way hiding the truth, and in fact DOES have evidence for evolution?

Personally, I don’t think my beliefs have to be held by anyone else but me.  I’d be happy knowing he’s happy.  I’d be even happier if his ideology helped make our relationship better, but it doesn’t.  He’s fairly reactionary, even militant about his beliefs.  And that’s the problem.  I don’t know how to keep our relationship intimate and harmonious under these circumstances.  \n\nEvery day, I’m subjected to an onslaught of “examples” of the “menace of religion”.  Our conversations go well enough if I just listen to him or at the times when I support his point of view, but when I don’t he gets upset.  So basically, I have to live with a constant disrespect of something very important and special to me.  I have no voice in my own home nor in my marriage on a very important matter.  \n\nNot that I don’t see his point sometimes.  And certainly, the failings of religion leave much to be addressed, but I’m not sure I can live with these daily attacks.  I think it’s ironic, since it’s the very thing he says religious people do to those who do not share their opinion.\n\nI’ve tried addressing this with him, but it only makes him defensive and upset.  I don’t know what to do from here.  It’s putting a wedge between us and I’m not sure I trust him with my heart any longer.  \n\nI’m bringing this problem here hoping that you folks might have insight in how to reach someone in this state.  \n",

Martin Luther infamously said (though not in this book) \"Mistress Reason is the Devil's harlot.\"  \n\nMy problem is this: he's obviously trying to use reason in a modern sense to either reveal contradictions in Erasmus' argument or to infer truths from biblical texts.  So I get the idea that he's using \"Reason\" to mean something different than what we would assume it means today.  But I haven't yet found any definition of what he means when he refers to \"Reason\" other than to infer that it's what the Sophists use/do (a group that he consistently derides).\n\nCan anyone give me a source or synopsis of what Luther is referring to as \"Reason\"?  He seems very careful about never defining his own terms while attacking the definitions laid out by others.  But, then, I'm only halfway through the book.",

Just let people believe whatever they want to in peace.\"\n\nWhile there are some fairly glaring issues with the house of straw I built to set the scene, I still feel it is a pretty reasonable approximation of how anti-atheists regard combative atheism, and I trust that you will take it with a grain of salt (or whatever superstition you prefer).\n\nI recently had a discussion with a self-proclaimed atheist who posted a list of [\"tips\" for discussing/debating with theists.](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/2b0x66/tips_for_discussingdebating_with_theists/) While there are some obvious, glaring issues with this list of \"tips,\" first and foremost among them is that the author even felt the need to *make the list.* I mentioned to the OP that he seemed to be looking to control what discussion was okay and not okay. The power in debates is, of course, with whoever can set the rules for the debate.\n\nNaturally, the OP was an atheist. Why am I not surprised? Every single person I have read using the \"don't be a dick\" argument invariably turns out to be either an atheist or an \"atheist.\" Do you know why this is? It scores cheap [ethos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethos) points with the reader. Anyone who uses this argument wants atheists to stop being angry, to stop challenging outdated beliefs. At the very least, they want to make it unacceptable to do so in a serious way, or tone down the conversation when it turns to real harm perpetrated by religion or religious followers. If someone who says they are an atheist wants other atheists to stop being dicks, the meaning is quite different from an outsider of some religious denomination telling \"those damn atheists\" to stop being such dicks.\n\nI brought this up because I'm not sure if there is a catch-all way to defeat this sort of condescending tone policing, other than to point out the silliness of an \"atheist\" specifically asking atheists to shut up or be nice and then pretending that they have the best interests of the people they have just silenced in mind. I think this is an interesting point of discussion, and I look forward to hearing everyone's thoughts on it.\n\nEdit: Great thoughts everyone, keep them coming!\n\nI would just like to point out that I do **not** consider that any confrontation or anything that can offend counts as being a dick.

        "text": "\n\nThe mere fact we exist can hurt my head sometimes. How could the universe have always existed, how can something just always be? If there was nothing there would always be nothing, how can something come from nothing? If there was nothing and then there was something, how does that make sense? What is even more troubling than the idea of existence even existing though, is the idea of not existing.\n\nWhen I die there are two options, both out of my control. Either I will continue on in some kind of after life, or I will cease to be. I think therefore I am, so when I stop thinking I will not. All my thoughts, concerns, questions, every bit that makes me me will simply disappear. I have so many unanswered questions, there are so many things I want to know, that I can never possibly know. Either the answer will come long after my death, like what happens to my children, how will humanity progress, what are other planets like, are we doomed on this Earth or will we eventually escape? Or the answers are stuck in the past, what was my Dad like, what did he like to do, what were his thoughts, what did he feel when he left us? If there is no after life I will never know these answers, without some \"magical\" ability, something that is currently beyond my current understanding, I will never know so many things.\n\nWhat is the point of my life, but to gather knowledge? To learn, to live, to dream and think. To wonder and discover. If I die and I disappear then there really is no point though, everything I have learned dies with me, sure some is passed on to the next generation, but most of me will be lost with me, all my memories, my thoughts that I kept to myself, those will all be gone. If there is an afterlife with eternal knowledge why keep living? Why not simply die now and learn all my answers? If I die and there is no afterlife I wouldn't know it to be wrong, I wouldn't know anything. I wouldn't be able to anguish over a bad decision, I wouldn't know it was a bad choice. Of course what's the rush then, if there is an afterlife like that then maybe there is some point of being here as well. And if there isn't this is all we have so might as well make the most of it. No matter what we don't really have a choice, there is no way to escape our fate, whatever will be will be, for millions of years the same fate has beset our ancestors, and the same fate will affect our descendants all the way down the line as well.\n\nWhy worry about it really, no matter what we do we will die, if not now then the heat death of the universe, eventually even the universe will die and we can not escape that. We might find ways to prolong our lives millions of years, but eventually it will happen, we will cease to think and be. Whatever our fate may be it is the same for all of us.\n\nI exist now, and I really like existing. There is so much I know, so much I want to know. What is the point of learning if I lose it all when I die. People always tell me \"well death will be like what life was like before you were born\". But that's the thing, I didn't exist then, I had no thoughts. I was not. There are a million questions I want to know, that are already impossible to know because of the nature of time, I wish so much there was an afterlife that explained everything, but every bit in me knows it's a lie. If I die I lose all my knowledge, I lose my lust for knowledge. If there is an afterlife though I will finally know everything I can't possibly know while alive, so with that logic in mind, why stay alive? That terrifies me, because I know what it was like before I was born, and I don't want to go back to that, to that not being.\n\nI think this is why there is no other intelligence life out there. After you reach a certain point you just get too smart, and realize there are no gods, no afterlife, this is it. They learn about the heat death of the universe and how nothing lasts, and in the end no matter what they do they won't last, nothing is important. And it scares them, and they end up wiping themselves out because of it, because of this revelation. Or they come to the conclusion they will eventually die no matter what, so why continue the cycle? Why keep bringing new life in that will have to suffer our same fate. When you realize there is no after life why bring a child knowing he won't last forever. Perhaps they breed themselves out of existence. Or maybe I'm horribly wrong and there is another reason. Maybe there isn't enough energy or materials in a solar system to actually make the escape. Maybe they can leave their planet, and make it to other planets, maybe even send out probes or a few vessels, but there just aren't the resources available for them to really expand out of the solar system, perhaps we are close to reaching peak technology, few hundred years, maybe a thousand, and that's it.\n\nEventually humanity will be gone, and we will be but a memory for the universe, our artifacts left behind, and then we won't even be a memory, and then the universe won't even be. We shouldn't exist but we do, so we need to make the most of it because it really is all we have, and we can't change that. Perhaps other civilizations have realized this too, that reality can't be changed, perhaps they've decided to simplify themselves, because the more they learn the more they are tormented. Sometimes I wish I was born a thousand years ago when we had so much less knowledge about the universe, when an afterlife was a certainty, instead of a horrible gnawing doubt.\n\nI feel no matter how I try to write it or say it, I can never express how much this devours me from the inside, the emptiness of knowing that there I will be gone, I won't see everything there is to see, people will never truly know me, when they die they won't gain a huge understanding of why I did the things I did, they will just be gone. I have a child, and sometimes I doubt having him, what if he anguishes the same way I do, always searching for answers he can never have. That's why I will stay alive, I will be there by his side as long as I can. Life is good, I lead a good happy life, but if I didn't and I felt the way I do now about existence and the afterlife I can see why you wouldn't want to continue on. Perhaps as resources grow low other civilizations stop leading good lives, and they all sterilize themselves, stop having children. Children are for hope, and I still do have some kind of hope of an afterlife, although the more I think of it the more I know it isn't so. Without hope why keep the cycle going?\n\nThis makes me seem suicidal or anti-children or pro-children, or who knows what people will read into this. That's not my message, that's just me horribly trying to explain my message. I just feel so much turmoil at the not knowing, every day I seem to dread death more and more, I am scared, and I can't change that. I don't want to die, but I will. I will cease to be. You think therefore you are, and when I am not, I won't even be able to think about not being, I will have no fear, no hate, no love, no wonder. I won't be able to reflect on my life, no regrets, no aspirations, no pride in decisions well made, no sadness at loss. And to me the saddest thing is I won't even know it, this huge loss of knowledge, of self, I won't know anything. I won't be.\n",

        "text": "So, my basic position is the following: I positively believe that it doesn't matter whether God exists or not. The reason is: in either case we should be good to each other - that human happiness is the ultimate end, so adding God is just irrelevant (if somebody gives a good advice, we should listen to it whether it is supposedly from God or not, similarly with bad advices); and any practically meaningful knowledge supposedly from God can and should be verified independently, so in the end it doesn't matter if God gave the idea or someone else.\n\nBut *therefore* I also oppose any religion or ideology that justifies something by *divine instruction*, e.g. gays are bad because God says so. If they're bad, there has to be a way to see this, so give the argument - and you should justify it even to yourself by an argument, if they aren't, it's not God it's purely your prejudice. On the other hand, if e.g. you come to conclusion that there is God and go to church, pray and feel good, I don't have anything against.\n\nSo I don't see any problem with God per se, only when God's or a prophet's instruction is used as a justification for anything, good or bad; it's just not a valid argument and I oppose its use no less than a militant atheist.\n\nSo is this apatheism or something else? How would you call my position? (It's irrelevant, but just for the info I do believe there is a certain First Principle responsible for the existence of the Universe - but I don't care even if someone calls it God or not. But I could come to a different metaphysical conclusion and yet all of the above would still be exactly the same.)",

Since this is an Intelligence Squared debate, they take the audience vote at the beginning, and after the debate. The end result is pretty surprising.\n\nIMO, Douglas Murray was the best speaker there. Ayaan Hirsi Ali wasn't very good at holding up a counterargument. The proposing team was a good combination, with Zeba Khan presenting the cute, cuddly side of moderate Islam and Maajid Nawaz with the history and contextualization and in depth know-how.\n\nWhether a religion is \"peaceful\" or not depends solely on its texts and teachings. There is no shortage of verses in the Quran condoning [violence and cruelty](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/quran/cruelty/long.html), [intolerance](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/quran/int/long.html), [misogyny](https://www.google.com.bd/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=5&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCoQjBAwBA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fskepticsannotatedbible.com%2Fquran%2Fwomen%2Flong.html&amp;ei=5szHU9uIKtiHuATTnoFQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNG8LThYh3ee17v88dJM45DtvaZiEA&amp;bvm=bv.71198958,d.c2E) and other not-so-peaceful things. The debate pretty much ends there, I think. I'm surprised the opposition side didn't quote more scripture, there's no shortage of ammunition there.\n\nWhat did you think of the debate?",

I've been eyeballing The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins for about a month now, I'll probably give it a shot eventually, but the reason I haven't given it a chance yet is because I don't believe he really understands christianity based on the reviews I've read. Based on the reviews, I feel like he's criticizing something he doesn't actually understand, and therefore also cannot relate to. That's why I'm hoping to find a good book about atheism written by a former christian, someone who would have a better and more in depth understanding of christianity to begin with, and their reasoning for becoming an atheist. I feel like I could also relate more to an author who has been where I have been. \n\nHopefully I didn't offend anyone who is a fan of Dawkins work, I do respect him and will give his work a read later down the road, but hopefully you can see my point of view. If anyone would like to have a discussion about anything I've said, that would be awesome! Anyway, can anyone suggest a book written by a former christian on the subject of why they switched to atheism? \n\nEdit: thank you all for the suggestions! I've added most of the books suggested to my amazon cart and will be buying them shortly, I would still appreciate more titles if you have them! I'll also be checking out some of the non-book stuff you all suggested, thanks again!",

        "text": "How do Christians reconcile the soul concept with our ever increasing understanding of brain science? Most scientists and cognitive philosophers now regard our consciousness as nothing more than a product of intricate brain organization and activity. (I say most because there are those who believe in dualism, although not the soul exactly, e.g., [David Chalmer's ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie).)\n\nChristians often attribute aspects such as morality, mood, temptations, and lusts, as components of the soul. More specifically, those components are driven by the Holy Spirit, which enters your body upon receiving Jesus as your savior.\n\nHowever, we now know that these components are well observed, and sometimes modifiable, properties of the brain. [Phineas Gage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Gage#Extent_of_brain_damage) is the classic example. After recovering from a railroad spike incident, his entire personality changed quite a bit, and for the worse. He exhibited the same types of behaviors that Christians would attribute to \"falling from Christ\" (profanity, crude remarks, rude to others), although the source was actually a change in brain functioning. That poor sap.\n\nEven commonly prescribed drugs such a Prozac can influence moral behaviors of individuals. Let's not forget the impacts of alcohol, LSD, and other euphoric and hallucinogens.\n\nThese don't *disprove* the existence of the soul, of course, but I feel these pose real threats to the soul concept. The more and more we realize the soul is just the brain, the less the soul even matters.\n\nPersonally, I feel this is one of the greater \"weak points\" to challenge Christians on, as there is a plethora of evidence along this line of reasoning.",
