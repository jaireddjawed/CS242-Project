        "text": "Hello Reddit,\n\nDown below are my questions, but first it begins with some background of the post.\n\n\n\n\nBartering:\nBartering involves a direct trade for goods and services. Although some aspects of this transaction are similar to the exchange of money, bartering required time as people hammered out the terms of the deal. Utilizing money as the medium for trade [1] simplified transactions significantly. \n\n[1] - (trade, a good or service is exchanged for money.)\n\n\nMy backstory:\nWhere I'm from, it's an accepted textbook standard that the \"bartering\" concept were precursors to the monetary system used in today's society. Which I I agree on, however in addition it's seen also as the \"first\" system. \n\n\nHuman density:\nGiving the nature of our archeological history, we see and many assume that humans have lived in families, bands, groups, intermediate groups, tribes, sub-tribes in the far past. According the Famous Dunbar’s groupings (and his quoted ~148 proposal). \n\nOthers suggest that numbers in bands narrow more down to 9 to 50 than his 30 to 50 people, etc. \n\n\nTrust concept:\nBefore and along with Barter?\nIf you were a person (1) who needed \"x\", you didn’t offer directly for the person (2)'s \"x\".\n\n\" Instead, you got person (1) or one he trusts to hint or to person (2) or their trusted one that you two were low or wanted \"x\", and let's say person (2) pr the trustee understands the message and gives you \"x\" (Let's so for example they got already plenty of \"x\")\"\n\n\" Down the line, the person (2) might want a \"x2\", and you’d help him out with \"x2\", service or good.\"\n\n\n...sidenote: haven't we all or many of us not done this to (older) family member or neighbors for example?\n\n\nWhich can be more viewed as  a commune or community concept. It's also seen by our distant relatives, in primates. (I lost the sources, I'll edit it later, Keith Chen,Yale  - also did some study on this)\n\nGiven with the band sizes and the small nature of the smallest groups, but even later for example the earliest known civilization in Turkey (Çatalhöyük) circa 9000 years ago. Which had many communal- oven, burials, storage etc. (Really interesting stuff. However an egalitarian society/community. \n\n\n\nI'd doubt that \"barter\" is the way money began, so here are my questions:\n\n\n\nQuestion 1.a: Is it correct?\nI don't seem to believe \"barter\" is the first exchange. However the simple thing as the trust concept seems like an good along sider or even possible pre-dater if I may boldly assume.\n\nQuestion 1.b: What's the \"correct\" coined term?\nEnglish isn't my first language, however I hastily called it the trust concept, what is a better way to coin it? \n\nQuestion 2.a: Inside our minds?\nHow do we call the measuring procedure(?) in our brain that denominates value of \"x\" and reassesses a trade for example. \n\nQuestion 2.b: Concept to practice?\nIsn't the beginning of money or the concept of, in a(n) (arhaic-) sense a measurement in our minds how we asses and value certain things for/against \"x\" in accordance to our environment that we live in?\n\n-\n\nOveral I'm happy to get more stuff on this, corrections, thoughts, ideas, etc.  I'm honestly struggling with the coin terms and terms overall.\n\nI'm sure many of you got better and more eloquent ways to put things into perspective! My thanks in advance!",

In the dialogue with Parmenides (I'm reading it here: http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/parmenides.html), Parmenides brings up several problems for Socrates' argument about Ideas: \" the ideas themselves will be divisible,\" if \"the individual is like the idea, must not the idea also be like the individual,\" and that \"none of the ideas are known to us, because we have no share in absolute knowledge? \" among other things. \n\nAfter this, though, Parmenides just states \"if a man, fixing his attention on these and the like difficulties, does away with ideas of things and will not admit that every individual thing has its own determinate idea which is always one and the same, he will have nothing on which his mind can rest; and so he will utterly destroy the power of reasoning.\" I am wondering, in any of his other writings, does Plato directly address these criticisms--the Third Man argument, the problem of resemblance, etc.--or did he just ignore them afterwards? As far as I can tell from the rest of Parmenides, the discussion just moves on to Zeno and Aristoteles talking about the one and the many. Have I missed something, or will these critiques be addressed in a different dialogue or other writing? Or do they just never come up again? Thanks!",

I did attempt to explain that philosophy is the lens through which one sees the world and thus it does influence people's views on things like economics, but I was either not convincing enough.\n\nHow can I explain to him that philosophy is valuable as a wider field of study (useful beyond studying it only as it applies to a specific field)? To this end, what are the practical uses of fields like epistemology, and how does it justify itself as a field?\n\nSorry if this is not the appropriate place for this, but I felt this was worth getting an answer from those more knowledgeable on the topic than me.

And example would be the thesis of \"capitalism is good,\" with the antithesis being \"no, socialism is good,\" with a synthesis being \"a mixed-market is best.\"  But if dialectics is simply to debate and compromise, what possible alternative could metaphysics be?  Is it simply extreme moral objectivism, stating that X idea is completely correct and to compromise is to distort it?  All online explanations of metaphysics seem to be so confusing compared to dialectics, so I hope I can get some help here!",

        "text": "The Ship of Theseus paradox is one of the most famous paradoxes in all of philosophy. It is a thought experiment that raises the question of whether an object that has had all of its components replaced remains fundamentally the same object. Recently, I have heard about a potential solution to this paradox and it usually referred to as ‘Worm Theory’ and this is supposedly heavily related to the concept of four-dimensionalism. It seems that from my reading four-dimensionalism is also known as perduantism or worm theory. \n\nLet me try to explain them:\n\nIn philosophy, four-dimensionalism (also known as the doctrine of temporal parts) is the ontological position that an object's persistence through time is like its extension through space. Thus, an object that exists in time has temporal parts in the various subregions of the total region of time it occupies, just like an object that exists in a region of space has at least one part in every subregion of that space. According to the worm theory, perduring objects are four–dimensional wholes occupying determinate regions of space–time and having temporal parts, or stages, each of them confined to a particular time. Simply, implicit assumption that worm theory therefore rejects is the notion that physical objects such as ships are merely three dimensional objects (where the three dimensions are spatial dimensions). Objects really do have four dimensions: three spatial and one temporal. \n\nFrom all this we can see that its two main theses are: \n1: Ordinary objects exist at more than one instant of time\n2: Ordinary objects have temporal parts\n\nSo, is worm theory a good candidate to serve as a reasonable solution to the Ship of Theseus paradox? What are some good arguments in the theories favour? What are its benefits over other potential solutions to the Ship of Theseus also? Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

And idealism believes the opposite.\n\nBut all we really have to go off of is our conscious experience of the world, so to categorize one part of the experience as \"material\" and the other as \"immaterial\" doesn't seem to make sense to me. And then to assume that one is derivative of the other, like how Idealism believes that the material world is only a lesser projection of some ideal or how Materialism believes that all thoughts and feelings only happen as a result of processes in the material world.\n\nLike why do we make that assumption to begin with. I feel like we should just go for the simplest explanation, that there is a conscious experience going on and leave it at that. To then categorize it and make baseless assumptions about one part of it being \"real\" and the other \"unreal\" makes no sense to me.\n\nI mean, Occam's razor dictates that the explanation that requires you to make the least amount of assumptions is the most likely to be true, right? So why is there this idealism/materialism split to begin with when both of these explanations just add unnecessary assumptions?\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong about any of these terms or concepts, I'm just some guy lol.",

How does consciousness and the content of consciousness differ? For example, do I have, from an ontological or other point of view, different consciousness at different times, or do I have the same consciousness with different content?\n\n2. Are the consciousness of different people the same phenomenon or are they different phenomena combined into one group? For example, electrons or water molecules are in all cases the same identical phenomenon, fundamentally indistinguishable (it is impossible to distinguish one atom from another or label one of them), but, say, stools or donuts, as well as any other complex objects are convenient language categories for objects that may differ, we can mark any of them and distinguish one from the other. Question: in this sense, is consciousness the first or the second? Is the consciousness simple or composite thing?\n\n3. If consciousness exists and it is different, if it is a composite object, then what does consciousness consist of? We do not mean correlates of consciousness, but self-consciousness. Has any of the philosophers talked about this?\n\nProbably there are no definite answers on these questions, but are there any interesting articles you could give the link of?\n\nI'm sorry if there are mistakes in the text, English is not my native language.

You don't have the means nor the power to fight against then, I would like to imagine a scenario where, if you stand against this evil force, you will likely be killed or harmed.\n\nHow ethical would it be to join this evil force, even commit acts of evil, in order to mitigate/ sabotage the force?\n\nI personally think that in face of this situation, a dead \"just\" person is useless. Of course it can't do good and no evil, but in this situation evil would keep on going unaffected. If a just person however, joins the evil force as a means to mitigate/ sabotage he can potentially do more good than evil on the long run. Even if he has to commit acts of evil on the process. Maybe even do more good than a \"just\" person on the outside that has no power to act.\n\nI am also curious to know if there's any kind of literature on this topic.",

In the first month, the bot scheduled 13 dates for me, all of which were with girls who matched my preferences and had similar interests to mine. I no longer have to waste time swiping aimlessly or struggling to come up with conversation starters.\n\nHowever all of this feels a bit dishonest. On one hand, the bot has allowed me to meet more women who are compatible with me, and has saved me a lot of time and effort. But on the other hand, I feel like I'm not being genuine in my interactions. The women I'm matching with are not aware that they are talking to a bot, and that doesn't sit well with me.\n\nI'm conflicted about whether or not to continue using the bot. I don't want to deceive anyone, but at the same time, I don't want to give up the benefits that the bot provides.\n\nTL;DR: made a dating app bot that gets me dates, thrilled it works but part of me feels like it’s dishonest and unethical.\n\nIs this ethical?",

This split made me wonder how accurate is this division in modern times, or is it more about how philosophy presents itself as a field, rather than how it really is lived by its adherents?

        "text": "A) Something exists in the universe, independent of any human, that determines what is right or wrong.  For example, there exists a deity or moral substance somewhere that can be examined or questioned to tell us what is right or wrong. \n\nb)  There is a universal trait in the human mind, which is not linked to morality, but that can be used to derive moral standards. For example, the human tendency to increase well-being could be used to establish that actions that promote well-being are morally right. \n\nc) That there is a universally shared trait of the human mind that determines what is right or wrong.  For example, let's say universally all humans are born with a part of the physical brain that then results a shared moral intuition that killing, when it serves no purpose other than fun, is wrong. \n\nd) Same as C but only 95% of humans have the intuition.\n\ne) Same as D but the intuition, like other nature-nuture mixes, can be enhanced or eliminated through upbringing and culture etc.  For example, you grow up in a culture where indiscriminate killing is ok then have a 50% chance of having no intuition that killing for fun is wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm confused if there is consensus in modern philosophy as to whether we can take subjective traits that we all share, such as in b and c, and, if they are shared and observable, call the resulting moral theory objective?\n\nApologies for basic misunderstandings and if not clear.  Philosophy is not my field",

The example of green grass is especially confusing. \n\nEven if I, for instance, see grass as red, not green, but believe that grass is green — i.e have objective knowledge of grass being green — then where is the problem? The belief itself is an intentional act. Why does it matter whether the content is true or not? I may have not derived it from subjective experience, but all the same, the intentional act of _believing_ that grass is objectively green is still faced before phenomenal consciousness, which I am picturing as a backdrop to all mental states (plz tell me if this is correct). \n\nWhy does it matter whether I have actually experienced grass as green is what I am asking? Obviously someone could've told me that grass is actually green. Anywho, my conclusion is that all _conscious_ states are phenomenal states. \n\nCan you please provide help here? Thank you",

        "text": "(1) Do expressivists treat sentences involving \"good\" and \"right\" (or \"bad\" and \"wrong\") as expressing the same sort of attitude? It seems like \"X is good\" has a different force to \"X is right\", especially since we could make a compound sentence of the form \"X is right, but it isn't good\". If \"good\" and \"right\" expressed the same attitude, it seems like that attitude would be both expressed and not expressed by the sentence.\n\nI like the idea of an expressivism which adopts a kind of emotivism about \"good\" and \"bad\", and a prescriptivism about \"right\" and \"wrong\", since \"good\" and \"bad\" seem to have an approval/disapproval function (in saying \"X is good\" I seem to be approving of X) and \"right\" and \"wrong\" have a prescriptive function (in saying \"X is wrong\" I seem to be instructing you not to X). But it seems unclear what attitude would be expressed in a compound sentence like \"X is right because it is good\" - approval or prescription? Perhaps both?\n\n(2) How do expressionists deal with modal moral judgements? Something like \"X might/would have been good\"? Is the modal force of the \"might\" or \"would\" located in the attitude itself, or in the judgement that expresses the attitude? If the second, then it seems like moral judgements would involve some form of description (about counterfactual attitude-expressions), which doesn't seem expressivist in spirit.",

        "author": "Droppedby365",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/11pd6z8/pride_good_or_bad/",
        "text": "Disclaimer: this post is only discussing the feeling of pride of one's obtained achievements, accomplishments, development, etc. If you are proud of characteristics that you were born with (i.e. nationality, colour of skin, etc), or defining characteristic that you didn't choose or work towards (ancestry, inheritance, etc) this is not the post for you. Also, you are dumb. End of disclaimer.\n\nSome time ago a friend told me \"before I met you somebody had told me you are too proud\". My friend said it as if the description \"proud\" is bad thing. He also said that now that he met me he doesn't think of me as \"too proud\". \n\nI didn't know what to think of this statement. Therefore, I never gave a solid answer to my friend. This is mainly because I do think that I am a proud person and I don't think it is necessarily a bad thing. I am proud of my academic and professional journey, I am proud of the ways I have supported friends, girlfriends, and family in the past, I am proud of my altruistic job, I am proud of my closeness to the people I choose, I am proud of my proactiveness in social interactions (apologising before I am confronted, or complimenting someone out of the blue), I am proud of helping stray animals, I am proud of my 8+ years of volunteer work at 31 years of age, I am proud of my physical condition, I am proud of my fighting spirit when it truly matters, and the list goes on...\n\nNaturally, I started thinking about what this other person could have meant by \"too proud\". If pride is a good thing, why did they present my pride as a negative? In my view, a person who is proud is generally not submissive, is assertive, has good leadership skills, provides constructive feedback and criticism when necessary, is confident, etc. You get the gist. \n\nLet's play this little mental game. Name the first historical figure you think of when you hear the word \"proud\". Go!\n\n... You thought of Hitler, didn't you? 😁 Well, the bastard is the most used historical example, so it's expected. But besides the square-moustached mean man with arm ankylosis, I also thought of Che Guevara, Nelson Mandela, Gandhi, Martin Luther King, even Jesus of Nazareth. Yes, even Jesus was proud in my opinion. Only a man deeply proud of his message is willing to undergo so many hardships and to die in order to communicate it.\n\nIn that sense, isn't pride a virtue? I think yes. I always thought yes. I think of pride as a synonym for dignity, poise, and self-esteem. But if it is a virtue, then why does it stick out so much when put it side-by-side with some other virtues?\n\nGenerosity\nHonesty\nJustice\nPatience\nKindness \nWisdom\nHumility\n*Pride*\n\nIt just doesn't stick. Especially next to humility. Proud people tend to demonstrate a lot of resistance to receiving advice from others. They are generally stubborn. This is the opposite of humility, isn't it? Interestingly, however, pride sticks well next to some virtues like assertiveness, courage, and perseverance. \n\nThen you put it next to vices. \n\nVanity\nArrogance\nLicentiousness \n*Pride*\n\nIt sticks with them too, doesn't it? This is interesting... It seems to me that pride can be a jack of all trades. It is a virtue when you need it to be a virtue, and a vice when you need it to be a vise. This is why both Hitler and Jesus came to mind during my previous mental game. \n\nNow, let's assume for a second that pride is only a bad thing. If it is only a bad thing, one should choose to be the opposite of that solely bad thing in order to be good, right? So what is the opposite of proud? \n\nShameful\nLowly\nMeek\nUnimportant (?)\nUndignified\nModest \nHumble \n\nI can go with the last two, but I can never allow myself to be any of the first five. So I guess I will be proud for life with some hints of modesty and humbleness. Is this a good compromise? I think yes. At the end of the day, we are left with three definitions for pride and two out of the three seem positive to me (I am not Machiavelli reincarnated, I promise). Hear me out.\n\n1. The positive feeling someone feels when they have achieved (or tried to achieve) something worthwhile, which results to their self-development. This feeling is impinged upon when someone insults their achievement. \n\n2. The feeling one gets when they realise their value as human. This feeling is impinged upon when someone insults their human dignity. \n\n3. The excessive sense of self-importance and self-worth. A feeling of being better than others. An overfed ego in the shape and size of Jabba the Hutt.\n\nTwo positive definitions. One negative. This is now starting to unfold... It seems like pride is a jack of all trades after all. This is why it is used in situations so radically different from each other. Like LGBTQ+ Pride 🌈 and The Proud Boys 💩, Hitler and Jesus. Perhaps the Bible was a bit too hasty to place pride amongst the 7 Deadly Sins. \n\nWhat is your opinion? Write your own thoughts in the comments and let's see if we can bring some salvation to pride or if it deserves to be forever stigmatised.",
