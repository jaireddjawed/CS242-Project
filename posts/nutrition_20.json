        "text": "Hello. I am trying to calculate what the nutrition label of my homemade muesli would say, if it were sold commercially. My question is, does the fact that I roast in change the nutritional makeup of the constituent ingredients?\n\nSo what I want to do is as follows:\n\n1. Look at the individual per gram contribution of fat/carbs/protein for each ingredient, multiply that by how much weight I include of each. Now I have the total weight of each nutrient in the whole batch.\n2. Weigh the whole batch, convert to grams, divide by 100. Now I know how many 100g portions are in the batch. \n3. Divide the number from Step 1 for each nutrient by the number in Step 2. Now I can make my own nutritional label for the homemade muesli showing nutrients per 100g of muesli.\n4. Also, for convenience, I will weigh my 1 metric cup breakfast portion and calculate the actual macros for that portion, for ease of recording.\n\nBut again, I am wondering, does the act of roasting the muesli change the nutritional profile of the ingredients, such that the above will not be accurate?\n\nIf it is relevant, the muesli is made as follows:\n\n* Mix rolled oats with heaps of various raw nuts and seeds. (e.g., almonds, pepitas, cashews, peanuts, etc.)\n* Mix through melted honey and a fat (either olive oil or butter).\n* Roast in the oven.\n* Wait to cool, then mix through dried fruit mix.\n\nThanks in advance for any help or advice!",

Do some people prefer their milk without the cream that settles on top? I understand not 100% of the cream is removed, but in our gallons there is none that settles on the top. So they're definitely removing some of it. Perhaps just to make butter for themselves?",
