        "text": "In 2015 we were faced with an empty nest. Our 4 boys had grown up and left the house to start their own lives. We read Vagabonding by Rolf Potts and The 4 Hour Work Week by Tim Ferriss. Those two books created a paradigm shift for us and helped us realize that we did not need to wait for our Cancer years and hope that we had the ability and resources to travel as we always wanted to. We spent the next 2 1/2 years purging, paying off debt, and creating an income online that was not location dependent.  [http://letsvagabond.com/about/](http://letsvagabond.com/about/)\n\nProof:  [https://www.facebook.com/letsvagabond/posts/1937805692936882](https://www.facebook.com/letsvagabond/posts/1937805692936882)\n\nEDIT: 7k was what was left after we paid off all of our consumer debt before we left. We had no home as we lost that in 2008. Based on The 4 Hour Work Week we decided that we would need to create an income of 2k per month to live to our desired comfort level. Some countries it would be more and some less, hence the average. Whe we left we were not quite there so we had to dip into that savings some as we continued to work to get to that 2k number.  We are now at that number and are working on the savings and building additional streams of income that are more passive and take less effort. Writing a book. Amy already has and we are beginning to market that, a new drop shipping business and in the future yes, we hope to monetize our blog but it is not currently ready for that. Here is the break down on our income and it is all location independent as it allows us to move around as we desire. Teaching English 1200-1400 per month. this is based on about 15 hours a week. We can easily make 2k a month off of just this if Amy work more hours. Royaltees from a Moonshine we created and brought to market 300 - 500 per month. Consulting other startups and bootstrappers 0 - 500 per month. and reisduals from a network marketing company 300- 500 per month. We have basic health insurance that is designed for expats and people who live abroad and spend most of their time outside the US. We have term Life insurance that covers expenses associated with either of our deaths. \n\nThis decision was made 2 1/2 years ago with the blessing and encouragement of our children. It was then execution of the plan over the next 2 1/2 years to pay off all of our debt, free ourselves from our possessions and find a way to make money online.\n\nI have tried to answer as many comments as I could. Some from My inbox and other here on the thread. I am sure it is easier to respond to an AMA that it is to run one! I have not dodged any questions I just may not have seen them all.\n\nCheers!",

We hope this Q&amp;A can help you decide if this would be a good fit for you.\n\n\n\nMy girlfriend and I did OTR and expedited as team drivers. After taking a break from the industry, we finally got hired with our current company. We work as traveling health technicians across a 4 - 5 state region; conducting health screenings for factory, railroad, and airline workers.\n\n\n\nEven though we both hold a CDL-A, only one is required per team. This job is less driving and more customer service. During the last 6 months we have a TOTAL of 6,000 miles driven! Our company is looking for new teams now that a few current teams are retiring.\n\n\n\nWe are paid monthly and we also get weekly Per Diem. Having a CDL-A bumps up your monthly pay; for example, I do all the driving, but because my girlfriend also has a CDL-A we both make the higher monthly salary.\n\n\n\nWe are on the road 6 months at a time (which can be hard for some) but we are in hotels every single night and do NOT work weekends. In 6 months, we have worked one Saturday for 4 hours, and were given Monday off to make up for it.\n\n\n\nWe want to help our company find good drivers - and we want to help truckers get into a great company. Ask us anything!!\n\n\n\nHere is the link to our company's advertisement on [working couples](https://workingcouples.com/job_opening/featured-job-opening-couple-driving-team-health-screening-technicians-100-travel-across-)\n\n\n[Proof!!](https://imgur.com/a/lm3AovD)",

Ask away..\n\n# Edit:\n\nI will continue to answer questions as long as anyone has any.\n\nI mentioned below that I have a child and some people obviously jumped on that but I'd just like to draw their attention to the below studies.\n\nOthers seem to think that there is a very high rate of re-offending among sex offenders so I've put studies about that below as well.\n\nPeople have asked me about (and I have commented on) pharmacological treatments, so again there are studies below in relation to this.\n\n.\n\nNSPCC Research Briefing 2013 – **“Perpetrators of sexual abuse are more likely to be a family friend or to be acquainted with the child rather than being a parent or stranger.”**\n\nFindings from the Australian Bureau of statistics 2005 and the US Department of Health and Human services found that **“a far greater number of child sexual abuse offences are perpetrated by adults who are not in a caregiver role.”**\n\nA personal safety survey from the Australian Bureau of statistics (2005) found that in a sample of 1,294 victims of sexual abuse **only 5% were perpetrated by the child’s father/stepfather.**\n\nIn a book review by children and youth services of Canada in (2010), “Michel Seto explores various explanations behind incest offending and review studies on propinquity that reveal that **men who spend less time caring for their children as infants and step-fathers are more likely to offend against children in their family.”**\n\n.\n\n# Studies on the risks of sexual reoffending and progressing from non-contact offences to contact offences\n\nM McManus and L Almond (2014) found that **“a correlation between internet offences and contact offences was non-significant and furthermore causation cannot be established.”**\n\nEndrass et al. (2009) found that in a sample of 231 men convicted of internet offences only **0.8% recidivated (reoffended) with a ‘hands-on’ offence within 6 years**. Their conclusion was that **“committing an internet offence alone is not a risk factor for committing a hands-on sex offence for those subjects who had never committed a hands-on offence.**\n\nEke, Seto and Williams (2011) found that in a study of 541 men convicted of non-contact offences **only 4% were charged with a contact sexual offence against a child and only 7% were charged with new internet offences within 4 years.**\n\nSeto &amp; Eke (2005) found that in a sample of 201 males convicted of non-contact offences **4% progressed to committing a contact offence.**\n\nSeto, Hanson and Babchishin (2010) conducted a meta-analysis in which they found that out of 4,464 offenders only **4.6% of online offenders committed a new sexual offence of some kind within 6 years, 2% committed a contact sexual offence and 3.4% committed a new internet offence. “The results of these quantitative reviews suggest that there may be a distinct subgroup of internet-only offenders who pose a relatively low risk of committing contact sexual offences in the future.**\n\n.\n\n# SSRIs as treatment for sex offenders\n\nA 2006 review in the British Medical Journal found that prescription medication such as Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors **reduces the risk of sexual offending and that a joint approach of sex offender treatment programme addressing offending behaviour and SSRI medication was the best approach treat sex offenders in the community.**\n\nF Lösel &amp; M Schmucker (2005) showed that “**in a meta-analysis of 69 studies with a comparison between 22,181 treated and untreated individuals, treated offenders showed 37% less sexual recidivism than controls.”**\n\nDr D Grubin, a professor of forensic psychiatry at Newcastle, Consultant forensic psychiatrist NHS and project director of Sexual Behaviour Unit in Newcastle found in his 2008 paper titled ‘The Use of Medication in the treatment of Sex Offenders.’ that “**the main impact of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are used in the treatment of depression is to reduce the intensity and frequency of sexual fantasies, and to lessen the force of sexual urges.”**\n\nA paper by BD Booth (‎2009) said: “**A growing body of literature supports SSRIs’ effectiveness in treating paraphilia’s and sexual offenders.”** Greenberg reviewed case studies and open drug trials of nearly 200 patients receiving SSRI’s. **Most studies showed response rates of 50% to 90%.** Positive effects included decreases in paraphilic fantasies; urges; and sexual acts; masturbation; hypersexual activity; sexual desires and libido. Some studies reported a preferential decrease in paraphilic interests.” And the “Bottom line” was that **“Pharmacologic treatment of male sex offenders can decrease deviant sexual behaviour.”**\n\nA study by the Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers concluded that “**Preliminary evidence suggests that pharmacological intervention may be effective interventions for reducing paraphilic sexual arousal and associated sexual offending.”** And that **“Pharmacological treatments are ideally combined with other therapeutic treatment modalities along with community-based interventions and supervised probation or parole.”**\n\n.\n\ntags of people who've mentioned these things and/or asked about the literature.\n\nu/MixmasterJrod\n\nu/NormanBorlaug69\n\nu/xcallmesunshine\n\nu/seanspotatobusiness\n\nu/devnullptr\n\nu/njscott63\n\nu/tmctaggart1410\n\nu/Ranch_Poptart\n\nu/xrebelstarfishx\n\nu/Boring_normie",

We recently published the first evidence in animals that combining two different anti-malarial vaccines can significantly reduce the disease burden. Ask us anything!\n\nOur proof: [https://twitter.com/imperialcollege/status/1019620387762688001](https://twitter.com/imperialcollege/status/1019620387762688001)\n\nEllie Sherrard-Smith – Hi! I’m an epidemiologist, parasitologist and mathematical modeller focusing on infectious diseases. I am part of the malaria modelling group at Imperial. Specifically, I concentrate of the impact of transmission-blocking interventions (TBIs) and vaccines, as well as vector-control interventions against malaria. I also have a broader interest in host-parasite dynamics, how the distribution of parasites and exposure rates vary across the animal kingdom, and what factors govern where individuals fall in that distribution.\n\nAndrew Blagborough – Hi! I’m a Principal Investigator at Imperial’s Department of Life Sciences. My main interests focus on the identification of novel anti-malarial TBIs and vaccine delivery. As part of my work, I develop assays to examine TBI efficacy and assess the practical impact of introducing TBIs on populations of mosquitoes and vertebrates – both in the laboratory and the field.\n\nWe’ll both be here to answer questions about a recent paper we published in the journal eLife, where we showed that two experimental anti-malarial vaccines, which independently achieve 48% and 68% reductions in malaria cases, can achieve 91% reduction when combined. Our study was carried out using genetically altered mouse parasites that express the same proteins as those expressed on the human version of the malaria parasite. You can read the full paper at [https://elifesciences.org/articles/35213?utm\\_source=reddit&amp;utm\\_medium=social&amp;utm\\_campaign=AMAJuly18](https://elifesciences.org/articles/35213?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=AMAJuly18).
