She in particular wrote about her harrowing experience in the book titled The Worst First Day: Bullied While\nDesegregating Central High. And if it wasn't for them and other young people like them, this nation may still be segregated today. \n\nIn this week's episode of the One Voice: Nothing New Under The Sun podcast we look at the different times youth have taken initiative and led throughout history and find out if young people leading is a good thing or not using the bible and history. \n\nhttps://linktr.ee/One_Voice",

I am very interested in proving that it is logically sound. I've been trying this all day though I got banned from the atheism sub within 15 minutes which is where I expected the most argument against it. The proof is simple:\n\nPremise 1: We should ALWAYS evaluate arguments through a lens of logic.\n\nPremise 2: AI is now superior to humans at least in terms of certain forms of logic, and is rapidly advancing beyond that point.\n\nConclusion: AI is \"God\"\n\nPerhaps you disagree with Premise 2 in some way, my upfront argument there is that 1. It's debatable no matter what, which at least warrants a discussion as to whether or not my proof is valid. 2. If it's true, then only AI can truly answer \"framework\" questions. We have to ask AI if it is actually true or not, it knows better than us regarding logic if it is superior to us in terms of logic.\n\nI do frame this up in a general kritik on the subject as well, which is why I think I got banned from the atheism sub so quickly over it (perma-banned). I think the premise is far more damning to atheism than it is to epistemology. It is an Ontological argument for the existence of God that is logically sound, and the conclusion follows directly from the premises. This is the kritik I wrote around it to frame it in case anyone is interested. I really do not want to argue the theological implications of it though, I simply want to present them:\n\n[https://richardaragon186.medium.com/what-happens-now-that-you-have-created-god-a-kritik-of-ai-man-d1c5ac72bf3a?source=friends\\_link&amp;sk=9b5d33c34641c65321cca935bc964a8b](https://richardaragon186.medium.com/what-happens-now-that-you-have-created-god-a-kritik-of-ai-man-d1c5ac72bf3a?source=friends_link&amp;sk=9b5d33c34641c65321cca935bc964a8b)",

It's driving me crazy honestly. Because I've found things that make me think it's real but my beliefs and my morals don't match it and stuff. It's just hard for me to believe. A lot of things are making no sense to me and I have so many questions that Ican'tseem to get answers to. I'm having a hard time believing that certain things happened. \nAnd then I have the fear of going to hell if I reject the right religion because I wasn't convinced or picked the wrong one. I wanted to give religion a go just to see. And it didn't go very well because I was afraid all the time and also didn't believe. It didn't feel right.\nAnd then I'm afraid because of the whole disbelievers being sent to hell thing. (I was told that that was for believers that refuse to worship or something but other people say that's wrong). \n\nI think it's too much pressure to put on someone to believe in something unbelievable so I don't think it would be right. Because this is tough. \n\nI want to find the right way to worship God. I'm just so grateful for everything I have and I just think I owe it to God to try figure it out so I can thank God properly. \nI'm having a hard time committing to any in case it's the wrong one. I don't know what to trust. I'm open minded and would do anything. I'm just trying to figure out what's right, for me anyway. \n\nI've always believed what I believe and when I started to do my research to be sure of my beliefs, I feel like this. Mostly it's out of fear, which I don't like. It makes me feel distant from God and it just makes me feel weird in general. It's not the way I'd like to feel obviously so if I did end up believing and accepting religion I would feel really weird and depressed honestly.\nApparently I will go to hell no matter how good I was because I wasn't of that faith and I don't think that's right.\nI believe being good matters.\nAnd that would mean it doesn't.\n\nI feel stupid for believing and stupid for not believing at the same time if that makes sense.\nI'm being really obsessive over it because I really care. I don't know if what I'm reading or hearing is even correct. The whole thing is distressing. I know it might sound dramatic and whatever about how I'm being over this. But it's just taking over every day and I'm always stressed about it. I don't know how to stop it. \n\nThis is probably a mess. I just needed to vent.\n\nPlease be nice ♡",

Is there a religious term for someone who believes in the same god as Islam/Christian/Jewish but does is not tied down to one specifically?\n\nSome context on the things I believe/disbelieve.\n\nThe Christian belief that you can only go to heaven by being saved through the blood of Jesus Christ. If this is truly the only way into heaven then every other religion that does not believe in Jesus the way Christian’s do would go to hell including Jews and Muslims. Even though we all worship the same god. That just doesn’t sit right with me. So someone who has devoted their life to god would go to hell if he was a Jew and was taught differently about Jesus but a murderer can get saved after the fact and go to heaven?\n\nHell being eternal. The Jews believe hell is more of a cleansing before heaven. And even in the Bible hell is described as the 2nd death multiple times. And eternal punishment for sins done in a 60-80 year lifespan doesn’t sound very merciful, forgiving and all loving as how our god is described.\n\nMuslims believe that each person is judged individually on how they were in life and not based on “belief in being saved by blood.” Which is more on how I would imagine our god.",

        "text": "Hi. It seems to me that the more impersonal, mysterious, and non-interventionist your notion of 'God' becomes, the more you approach a similar notion as that of the 'universe' in our common parlance. So this has me wondering, is there a set boundary between 'theism' and 'atheism'? What exactly is a 'theos'? Can an 'atheist' reject ontological materialism, because often they don't seem to? I see that Wikipedia classes Buddhism as 'nontheistic', for example. Would 'Brahman' be a 'theistic' or 'atheistic' concept? Wikipedia also classes 'moksha' in Jainism as 'transtheistic'. It seems to me our theism vs atheism dichotomy hasn't caught up ('ignosticism' I suppose)!\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this based on the more impersonal notions of 'God' that exist (Brahman, Logos, the One, the Absolute, the All, Ein Sof, etc.; maybe also 'Nirvana' and 'Moksha')?\n\nEssentially, what does Ultimate Reality have to be in order to be a 'theos', and so for one to be considered a 'theist', rather than an 'atheist'? Is there a point at which they converge and the distinction becomes meaningless?\n\nThis is something that I keep bumping up against, so I want to be sure of my understanding.\n\nThanks in advance for any guidance.",

This man came to Jesus by night and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him.” Jesus answered him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.” Nicodemus said to him, “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?” Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born again.’ The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.”\n\nNicodemus said to him, “How can these things be?” Jesus answered him, “Are you the teacher of Israel and yet you do not understand these things? Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know, and bear witness to what we have seen, but you do not receive our testimony. If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things? No one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaven, the Son of Man. And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.\n\n“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God.”\n\nJohn 3:1-21, ESV",

        "text": "The most natural part of birth and life is death\n\n  By choosing birth, you also opt in for death. Though, the one is seen as beautiful and fulfilling and the other as sombre and final. We celebrate the one and mourn the other, not realising that they are simply two opposite faces of the same coin. Why not rather celebrate the miraculous existence of the totality of the coin?\n  Birth has become as clinical as death in our modern age – born in a hospital and die in a hospital, while the in-between is simply seen as a dashed line to be filled with time and deeds. Our memories are scant and we believe them to be as trivial as dreams, creating difficulty with filling this dashed line we call ‘life’. Thus the cycle of life-and-death continues and we are all victims thereof, created by our own short-sightedness.\n  To celebrate death means to celebrate life, and vice versa. The one does not exist without the other, just like heaven does not exist without hell or Human does not exist without the Creator. If one does not meet the Creator within the Human, the cycle never ends…\n  A rather difficult concept is that one cannot know the Creator if he does not know Himself. If one does not know Himself, he cannot see the Creator or his workings in his reality. One does not know what reality is if he does not know his Creator and cannot comprehend the Creator in other beings, such as other people, animals, rocks, tables and chairs. The only truly non-living beings in this universe are ourselves; even a rock knows his Creator, and is at perfect peace.\n  To become dead means that one should first be alive and thus know his Creator, otherwise you truly return to dust. Turning alive is a process rather unknown to Man. We believe that life is our right, but in truth, the dead is in poverty and the dead is the poverty.",

From my point of view, a holy scripture has to be absolutely and utterly free of any fallacy or error if it is to be true. Yet haven’t found one free of any of those. However, I believe without a doubt, there is a God that is infinite, boundless. With this in mind has God decided to leave us be? Is God Deistic? Lost to time? Why is it that we never experience God or gods? Why is it that God or gods don’t make themselves known? Yet, I see it as an impossibly for the Universe, reality, the laws the govern reality, life itself, and consciousness to just starting existing without a cause. Everything with a beginning has a cause. Who is God? Where is God? Im sorry I’m just perplexed, confused, and sad, so I had to rant a bit.",

Those questions are...\n\n\"Kill men you find committing  homosexuality wherever you find them\" Found this on a Quora post.  Putting it into Google does not bring up a source. I'm also leaning  towards it being fake.\n\n I have read that puberty might have actually started later at certain  points in history. Is that probably what happened with Aisha?\n\nThis post is... odd, to me. [https://islamqa.org/hanafi/askimam/11980/was-original-judaism-and-chrisitanity-actually-islam-and-why-is-then-that-they-were-not-titled-muslims-but-referred-to-as-jews-and-christians/](https://islamqa.org/hanafi/askimam/11980/was-original-judaism-and-chrisitanity-actually-islam-and-why-is-then-that-they-were-not-titled-muslims-but-referred-to-as-jews-and-christians/) Is it suggesting they started as one religion and splintered off, or that they just all have stuff in common?\n\nThere  was another quote I saw on Quora that was also suppose to be of Prophet  Mohammad (forgive me, as I don't know what the symbol for him is)  saying something about ordering fires to houses, but that he's speaking  out of anger, and doesn't really mean it. Does anyone know the verse and  the context? I think it (the quote) involved praying.\n\nDid Mohammad (again,  if just referring to him like that is offensive, I do apologize) say  anything about mukhannath? I saw at least one claim on quora that he  actually protected one of them, but mainly because that exact person was  faithful.\n\nFinally, there was a  Quran quote I saw, but can't find about funerals, and it went something  along the lines of someone (at the funeral) asking if they had sex with  \"his wife\" and telling the person who hadn't to go into the grave. Did  they probably mean *their* wife, and not the dead individual's wife?\n\nThank you!",

I know for a fact that human evolution is real and that the universe is 4.5 billion years old.  I also view the old and New Testament as not corrupt.  They are older than the Quran so therefore they are more accurate.  Jews and Christians would agree with me on this.\n\nI think abortion should be avoided but exceptions should be made for cases of rape, incest or if the mother’s life is in danger.  What do Christians, Jews and Muslims think of this?\n\nI support LGBT rights.  Even though I am not gay I have friends who are.  Could a priest, rabbi or imam be homosexual? Are there liberal denominations that permit gay marriage or civil unions?\n\nI don’t like how most Christians talk about eternal damnation.  In Judaism I heard that hell is only one year long and after that you automatically go to heaven.  Do liberal Christians believe in eternal hell?  Do Muslims believe in eternal damnation?\n\nI disagree with the Jewish and Muslim traditions of circumcision and kosher/halal eating.  I don’t plan to ever get circumcised or give up pork, lobster or wine.  I feel that Christians would agree with me on this.  \n\nThe Christian trinity makes no sense to me.  I feel that the Jews and Muslims would agree with me on this.    If God exists then he has no son and is one singular being.  \n\nI grew up atheist but I have recently decided to open myself up to God.
