The topic i have chosen is do with aerodynamics and things similiar to that .  \nI need assitance in understanding this problem and how to solve it, i would like some pointers.\n\nThe problem:\n\nI wanted to discover the smallest Wing area required of batman for him to glide across the city of gotham as he does in the movies.\n\nSo far i have determined many formulas that i may need to use, i essentially want to optimize here using calculus but i am quite lost on how to approach the problem. I want to calcualte the cape and its size as if it was a wingusit as that is what it is similiar to\n\nSome of the intial conditions are that he jumps of off a 100m tall bulidng. He has a glide ratio of 5. the wind speed is roughly 4m/s. I have also understood that i would need to use lift force and drag force and specifically induced drag and not parasitic.\n\nI also understand that there are glide ratio is given by the distance travelled horizontellay divided by the distance travlled vertically, so a ratio of 5 means that for every meter he drops he has travelled 5 metres horizontally. It is also clear that lift force divded by drag force is equal to the glide ratio, but since lift force and glide force are essentially the same formulas with their respective co-effcients, a glide ratio can simply be found by Cl/Cd.\n\nI have all this information and even some more about angles of attack and thigns similar to that, but dont really know how to anythign with it and how to actually solve this problem. So any assitance or clarification would be helpful since my math report is due in like 2 days.",

When the frequency is changed the behaviour of the fire is altered by the frequency.\nThe fire holds the information of the frequency and behaves accordingly. \nIt is not a mass but energy therefore it doesn't have a resonant frequency as such. If I'm wrong please tell me, I find this super interesting.\n\nNow in the most basic graphic of an atom you will have protons, electrons &amp; neutrons. The +/- &amp; ground properties of the respective particles will give birth to an energy field which holds the mass together.\nIf one was able to generate the energy of said particle would it behave in the same way as the fire without having a resonant field 'or' would it have a resonant field because of its pre-requisites? By that I mean that it is a fixed static rather than an 'open' force. \n\nIf this is mumbo jumbo please be blunt. Thank you! \n\nThe reasons for asking is that I am constantly thinking about the tuning of musical notes because I am a musician. I was researching cymatics and found geometry fascinating. Trying to see if I can use a system of tuning which will be more fluid. Thank you again!",

Then using that difference to calculate earths velocity seeing as light has a fixed speed through space. I’m assuming there are some laws of relativity i’m yet to understand in this experiment which would’nt make it work as i think.\n\nI tried googling and got no real answers except this «space itself» i’m referring to is sometimes called «the aether», and only various velocities the earth is travelling to with respect to other objects.\n\nI also appreciate correction on wrong or poor physics terms used!",

        "author": "rishohag",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/z4h97g/interpretation_of_the_first_ecological_report_on/",
        "text": " \n\nRecently, the Scientific Research Evaluation Laboratory jointly established by the Documentation and Information Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Elsevier jointly released China's first research report on China's scientific research ecology from a gender perspective, \"Portraits of Chinese Scientific Researchers from a Gender Perspective\". The main planner of the report, Yang Liying, a researcher at the Documentation and Information Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, was interviewed by Netease Technology and other media. Regarding the ecological situation of Chinese female scientific researchers, Yang Liying made a further elaboration and explanation in the interview.\n\n\"Report\" female scientific researchers are rapidly increasing year by year, and more and more female scientific researchers are participating in scientific research work. Judging from the changes in the proportion of male and female scientific researchers, the proportion of female scientific researchers in China has risen from 13% in 2005 to 27.7% in 2019, an increase of 14.7 percentage points.\n\nYang Liying believes that there are three main reasons for this phenomenon: first, the progress of various scientific research fields is closely related to the civilization and progress of the whole society; Third, on the basis of social progress, women's self-worth has become increasingly diversified.\n\n\"Originally we may think that our role is single or dual, but now we feel that we have more diverse ideals and more dimensional abilities to do other things. These three levels of reasons promote the development of Chinese scientific research. The gender gap is constantly narrowing and improving, but of course there are still some problems that need us to improve.\" Yang Liying said.\n\nIn fact, although the report shows that the proportion of female scientists is increasing year by year, judging from the roles played by men and women in scientific research, male researchers are more inclined to act as corresponding authors and play an organizational role, while women are more inclined to be the first Author, to play an executive role.\n\nIn this regard, Yang Liying believes that the reason for the \"rapid increase in the proportion of female scientists, but relatively few leading roles\" is related to the so-called \"leaky pipeline\" phenomenon.\n\nAccording to the scientific report released by UNESCO in 2015, there is a picture of \"leaking pipeline\", which means that as the pipeline continues to extend, more and more water flows, and finally less and less remains. The flow direction of the pipeline refers to the level of various positions, or things of different difficulty. In the UN report, several nodes of the pipeline are undergraduate students, master students, doctoral students and researchers. Women accounted for 53% of undergraduates, 53% of masters, and 43% of doctors. When it comes to scientific research activities, women only account for 28%.\n\n\"Scientific research is a highly competitive activity, and the requirements for ability are also multi-dimensional. If you want to take a leading role, you need to take on more responsibilities and pressure, invest more energy, and have a higher academic level. You must have experience, resource allocation and management skills.” Yang Liying said, “More people will think that such a job will be more challenging for women. Because of the different social roles, women will naturally think that it is easier to choose one. Models are more beneficial to their own development, and such role differences may cause women to leave the stage in the later stages.\"\n\nTherefore, Yang Liying suggested that in addition to government policy support, female workers also need to do more self-improvement to change this phenomenon. (Cui Yuxian/Text)\n\n**The following is part of the content of NetEase Technology and other media’s interviews with Yang Liying, a researcher at the Documentation and Information Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, director of the Department of Metrology and Evaluation, and doctoral supervisor, and Zhai Yanqi, an assistant researcher at the Documentation and Information Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences:**\n\n**1. There is a point of view that adding the word \"female\" in front of \"scientist\" means that the so-called \"female scientist\" is considered gender discrimination. I would like to ask how do you view this issue?**\n\n**Yang Liying:** From my personal experience, whether there is gender discrimination in the word \"female\" for \"female scientist\", my intuitive feeling is that I have never had such an experience. Perhaps in special situations, \"female scientist\" or the word \"female\" will make some women feel uncomfortable. But in my own experience, I think female scientists actually reflect the difficulty of women in scientific research and the respect, tolerance, understanding and care of women in the scientific research community or the whole society as a whole.\n\n**2. In the report, the proportion of female scientists is rising rapidly, but the proportion of women in undertaking some leading tasks is very small.** **I would like to ask why such a situation occurs, and what suggestions do you have in this regard?** **We can also see from the report that the gender gap in China's scientific research field is gradually improving. I would like to ask what are the reasons for this result?**\n\n**Yang Liying:** The proportion of female scientists is increasing rapidly, but the leading role is relatively small. I speculate that this is also related to the \"leaky pipeline\" phenomenon we mentioned in the report, which is actually a phenomenon that everyone in the global gender research agrees on. For scientific researchers, if you want to assume a leading role, you actually need to take on more responsibilities and pressure, put in more energy, have academic level, experience, resource allocation ability, and management ability , the requirements for all aspects of ability are very high.\n\nTherefore, we see that although the proportion and participation of female scientists are increasing, they still do not play a leading role. This phenomenon is consistent with the \"leaky pipeline\" we mentioned. But this part, I did not specifically mention it in the report. The main reason is that our report positioning is still a data portrait, and there are no more extended explanations for some issues.\n\nRegarding the reasons and suggestions for the gradual improvement of the gender gap in China's scientific research field, the suggestions and reasons are actually the same. We are gradually improving, but there are still some problems, so we need to continue to strengthen this \"reason\" on the basis of the current gradual improvement.\n\nOn the one hand, gender differences in scientific research also depend on overall social progress, which is a big background. Therefore, the progress we see in all scientific research fields is actually closely related to the civilization and progress of our entire society.\n\nSecond, scientific research management departments have issued many policies to promote gender balance, which have played a positive role.\n\nThird, on the basis of social progress, women's self-worth has become increasingly diversified. Originally, we might think that our roles are single or dual, but now we feel that we have more diverse ideals and More dimensional abilities to do some other things.\n\nSo on the whole, it is these three levels of reasons that promote the continuous improvement and progress of gender differences in the field of scientific research in China. Of course, there are also some problems that need us to improve.\n\n**3. There are a lot of data in this report, which group of data impresses you the most?** **Why is this set of data unexpected?**\n\n**Zhai Yanqi:** First of all, when we analyzed the differences in the influence of male and female scientific and technological workers, we found that the average number of papers produced by men is about 10, while we women produce about 7 papers, although we women The output of scientific and technological workers is not as good as that of men, but in fact, the difference in the degree of attention to scientific research achievements between men and women is very small. These data allow us to witness the important role played by \"her power\" in promoting technological progress. At the same time, we also hope that through this set of data, the self-confidence of female scientific and technological workers can be further enhanced.\n\nThe second point is which set of data is more unexpected. In fact, the results of male and female researchers applying for the National Natural Science Foundation of China's Youth Fund surprised us. Because according to our statistics, before 2011, the ratio of male to female applicants for the National Natural Science Foundation of China was about 64:36. In 2011, the National Natural Science Foundation of China issued a series of policies to relax the age for women to apply for the Youth Fund to 40 years old.\n\nSince then, the number of women applying for youth funds has increased year by year, especially in 2018, the number of women applying for youth funds has actually exceeded that of men. The impact of the NSFC’s policies is beyond our expectations, because we can truly feel through the data that a series of policies have had a very important impact on promoting women’s enthusiasm for participating in scientific research.\n\n**4. What role do Chinese women scientists play in China's scientific research?** **We know that the proportion of female scientists in China is increasing year by year, so what role does this play in global scientific research?**\n\n**Yang Liying:** First of all, regarding the question of \"the role of Chinese women in scientific research\", we put forward the slogan \"Women want half the sky\" in the last century. I understand that \"half the sky\" is an ideal state. It does not necessarily mean that a ratio of 50% is \"half the sky\".\n\nFrom the perspective of data, because we are constantly reviewing when making reports, or comparing the performance of women in scientific research activities in other countries in the world, to compare with China's performance.\n\nIn fact, different countries have different models. It is still difficult to say that a high level of scientific and technological development or a high level of civilization must have a high proportion of female scientific researchers. It is possible that women's performance or participation has a lot to do with cultural background, traditional concepts, and national policies. For example, for Chinese women, if we look at a longer-term data, we will find that the performance of Chinese women in the scientific research field is a bit like a \"U-shaped\" curve, which means that we had a relatively high participation rate of women in the earliest days, but in the There has been a decline in the development process, and now it is actually in a rising period. However, there is still no way to answer when this rising period will end and when it will be the best ratio.\n\nBut all in all, we see that the gap between women's performance in scientific research activities and men's is constantly narrowing, which is very positive. If you want to look at it from the perspective of the gap, we actually still have room for improvement as a whole. For example, we now see the phenomenon of \"leaking pipelines\", especially in the back, where the leakage will be very fast. This actually shows that we have some areas that need to be improved. policies to support, and women themselves also have areas that need to be improved.\n\n**5. Last year, the State Council also issued the \"Outline for the Development of Chinese Women (2021-2030)\".** **This document also pointed out that the data of women in all fields of higher education has actually surpassed that of men, but in the field of science and technology, the proportion is actually much lower than that of men, and may only exceed 30%.** **But in the field of higher education, such as postgraduate education, the proportion has reached more than 50%, or even 60%, which is actually much higher than that of men.** **How do you think there are such a high proportion of women in the field of higher education, but there are relatively few talents engaged in scientific research or technology?**\n\n**Yang Liying:** In fact, many colleagues, including some sociologists, are discussing this phenomenon. This phenomenon can be expressed in two ways, one is \"leaking pipeline\", according to the scientific report released by UNESCO in 2015, there is a picture in it is \"leaking pipeline\", it means that with The pipes continue to extend, more and more water flows, and finally less and less is left. The flow direction of the pipeline refers to the level of various positions, or some things of different difficulty. But in this UN report, several nodes of the pipeline are undergraduate students, master students, doctoral students and researchers. Women accounted for 53% at the undergraduate level, then 53% at the master's level, and dropped to 43% at the doctoral level. Then when it comes to women engaged in scientific research activities, it is only 28%.\n\nAnother expression we call \"scissors difference\", the phenomenon of \"scissors difference\" actually reflects that the higher the position of women, or the further back they go, as the difficulty increases, the number of women decreases.\n\nRegarding the answer to this question, in fact, everyone does not have a particularly clear consensus. Judging from my personal intuitive experience, there are generally two possibilities. One is the difference in social roles, no matter which country you are in, because scientific research is a highly competitive activity after all, and the requirements for ability are also multi-dimensional, and there are also requirements for the energy that needs to be invested in this activity, so More people would think that such a job would be more challenging for women. Because of the different social roles, women will naturally think that choosing an easier model will be more beneficial to their own development. Such role differences may make women leave the stage later.\n\nAnother more controversial speculation is the physiological difference. I don't think there is a difference in intelligence between men and women, but I think that the biological differences between men and women determine the differences in the abilities, specialties and thinking modes of men and women. These differences lead to different success rates for men and women in different fields. Therefore, compared to engaging in scientific research, if it is easier to succeed in other fields, women will also choose the way that is most beneficial to them.\n\nAs our scientific research management department, we hope that more women will participate in scientific research activities, especially to provide such opportunities and create such conditions for women who are willing to engage in scientific research activities. This requires a systematic solution from the whole society Program.",

        "text": "Astronomers observing star clusters in our galaxy have found evidence that controversially defies Newton's laws of gravity and could alter our understanding of the universe. The puzzling finding could support a controversial idea that eliminates dark matter altogether.\n\nThe researchers found this evidence by looking at open star clusters, or loosely bound groups of up to a few hundred stars that lie within larger galaxies. Open star clusters have trails of stars, known as \"tidal tails,\" in front of and behind them. The researchers' observations indicate that such clusters have many more stars located in the general direction of their travel through space than stragglers. This calls into question Newton's law of universal gravitation, which suggests that there should be the same number of stars in both tidal tails.\n\n\"It is extremely significant,\" astrophysicist pavel kroupa of the University of Bonn told Live Science. \"There's a big effect.\"\n\nKroupa is lead author of a study published Oct. 26 in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society that argues that the observations are evidence for Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), an alternative theory of gravity to the universal law of gravitation. widely accepted Newtonian.\n\nThis uneven distribution of stars is remarkable, but not extreme enough for any kind of dark matter — an invisible substance thought to exert a powerful gravitational pull on the visible part of the universe — to be involved, Kroupa said.\n\n“This is basically a game changer,” he said. \"This destroys all the work done on galaxies and on cosmology \\[that\\] assumes dark matter and Newtonian gravity.\"\n\nIn the Hyades star cluster (above), the number of stars (black) in the leading tidal tail is significantly greater than those in the rear. In the computer simulation with MOND (below), a similar picture emerges. (Image credit: University of Bonn)\n\n**Dark matter?**\n\nIsaac Newton's law of universal gravitation, published in 1687, states that all particles in the universe attract each other with a force proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of their distance. Albert Einstein later incorporated this law into his theory of generality. relativity which was published in 1915.\n\nBut Kroupa said that in the time of Newton and Einstein, astronomers didn't even know galaxies existed, so MOND was developed to bring it up to date with observations.\n\nMOND, also known as Milgromian dynamics in honor of astrophysicist Mordehai Milgrom who developed it in the early 1980s, argues that regular Newtonian dynamics does not apply to very large scales of galaxies and galactic clusters, despite what most astrophysicists believe that yes.\n\nThe main consequence of MOND is that dark matter does not exist, an idea that most astrophysicists dismiss, Kroupa said. \"Most scientists completely reject Mond,\" he said. \"Many serious scientists don't think Mond is serious, so they wouldn't consider looking at him.\"\n\n**Star clusters**\n\nIn their study, the authors report observations of five of the closest open star clusters to Earth, including the Hyades, a roughly spherical group of hundreds of stars that lies only about 150 light-years from our sun.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe researchers found that the stars had accumulated in the main tidal tail in all five clusters, while the largest discrepancy from regular Newtonian dynamics was seen in the Hyades cluster, where there are better measurements, Kroupa said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe observed discrepancies strengthen the case for MOND, but they cannot be the result of the invisible action of dark matter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the case of Hyades, \"we would have to have a dark matter clump in there at about 10 million solar masses\" to explain the results, he said. \"But it's just not in the data.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFuture studies will use more precise data on star positions from new space telescopes, such as the European Space Agency's Gaia, he said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, because MOND is not widely accepted by many scientists, the new study's findings are controversial.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSabine Hossenfelder, an astrophysicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Frankfurt, told Live Science in an email that she was pleased to see the researchers working on MOND gravitational simulations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut “as they themselves admit to the paper, they are using a ballpark estimate that needs to be confirmed… \\[and\\] they have not quantified how big the disagreement with the data is,” he said. \"So I think it remains to be seen how good this argument really is.\"",

        "text": " \n\n A team of astronomers has applied a new technique to a group of galaxies and the faint light between them, known as \"intragroup light,\" **to characterize the stars that inhabit them.**\n\n   Lead author of the **study published in MNRAS**, Dr. Cristina Martínez-Lombilla from the UNSW (University of New South Wales) School of Physics, said: \"We know almost nothing about intracluster light. The brightest parts of the Intra-group light is about 50 times fainter than Earth's darkest night sky. It is extremely difficult to detect, **even with the largest telescopes on Earth or in space.\"**\n\n   Using their sensitive technique, which removes light from all objects except intracluster light, the researchers not only detect intracluster light, **but are able to study and tell the story of the stars that populate it.**\n\n   \"We looked at the properties of the stars within the group, those stars lost among the galaxy groups. We looked at the age and abundance of the elements that made them up, and then we compared those characteristics with the stars that still belong to the galaxy groups.\" Martinez-Lombilla said.\n\nThank you for watching\n\n**\"We found that the intracluster light is younger and less metal-rich than its surrounding galaxies.\"**\n\n   The orphan stars in the intracluster light were not only 'anachronistic', but appeared to have a different origin than their nearest neighbors. The researchers found that the character of the stars within the group appeared similar to the nebulous \"tail\" of a more distant galaxy.\n\n   Combining these clues allowed the researchers to **piece together the history of intracluster light and how its stars came to come together in their own stellar orphanage.**\n\n   \"We think that these individual stars were stripped at some points from their parent galaxies and are now free-floating, following the gravity of the group,\" Martínez-Lombilla said. \" **The removal, called tidal removal, is caused by the passage of massive satellite galaxies, similar to the Milky Way, which drag stars in their wake.\"**\n\n   This is the **first time that intragroup light from these galaxies has been observed.**\n\n   \"Revealing the amount and origin of intra-group light provides a fossil record of all the interactions a galaxy group has undergone and provides a holistic view of the system's interaction history,\" said Martínez-Lombilla.\n\n   \"Also, **these events happened a long time ago**. The galaxies \\[we're looking at\\] are so far away, we're looking at them as they were 2.5 billion years ago. That's how long it takes for their light to reach us.\"\n\n   By observing events from long ago, in galaxies so far away, **researchers are contributing vital data points to the slow evolution of cosmic events.**\n\n   The researchers pioneered a unique technique to achieve this penetrating view. \" **We have developed a customized imaging procedure that allows us to analyze the faintest structures in the Universe**,\" said Martínez-Lombilla.\n\n   \"It follows the standard steps for the study of faint structures in astronomical images, which involves 2D modeling and removal of all light except that from intra-cluster light. This includes all bright stars in the images, galaxies that within-group light obscuration and a subtraction of the continuous emission from the sky.\n\n   \"Our main long-term goal is to extend these results to a large sample of galaxy groups. We can then look at the statistics and discover typical properties regarding the formation and evolution of light **within the group and these extremely common systems of groups. of galaxies\"**, he concluded.",

Everywhere that I have read simply states that they enhance the density of final states, but how exactly do they do this?\n\nAlso, what exactly does the Purcell factor itself mean?

The thing is, I have studied Physics at school but they were very very basic, like cinematics and magnitudes and that's all. So, before I get into college I'd like to self-study some more advanced things. I've looked throught the Physics' classes at the college I've chosen and they mostly cover things from electricity, magnetism, dynamics, cinematics, optics, thermodynamics, etc.\n\nIf someone knows any online resource, course, book, etc I can study from I'd appreciate it a lot! I really like this subject, so I don't mind putting lots of effort into it. Also I'm not looking for perfection or to be an expert before I finish school, I just want to have a more general picture. Thanks :)",

        "text": "Hello! My question is directed towards those who engage with Physics professionally, such as Physicists, Engineers, Research Scientists, etc.  \n\n\nI'm a third-year Applied Physics undergrad who's currently doubtful about the nature of my education, and I am worried that a sizeable percent of my learning has only been constrained towards a specific and narrow classroom context. Jobs involving actual physics in real life situations may or may not be favorable to knowledge transfer from a strict classroom context.  \n\n\nI've recently read about the concept of \"directness\", which states that \"its actually while doing the thing you want to get good at when much of learning takes place.\"  One example I've seen (with this example and the previous quotation taken from Scott Young's book, \"Ultralearning\")  involves a young architect unable to find a job because his undergraduate degree was mostly concerned with design and theory, and not with the reality of building codes, construction costs, and complex software. In order to remedy this, the architect found a job in a print shop that does printing of architectural blueprints, which enabled him to be exposed to the blueprints firms were using and to absorb countless, real-life architectural details. The architect also practiced using a complex design software firms were using all the time.   \n\n\nI've been wondering if this story can have a real-life Physics equivalent, and what I can do in order to engage in the day-to-day work of Physicists, Engineers, and Scientists more directly. Do I also need a specific software to learn? What types of problems do you solve, and what does your skillset normally call for? How can I become a better Scientist and Engineer who won't have a problem transitioning into real-life work? Numerous perspectives (from Academia, Industry, Research) are very much appreciated.  \n\n\nTl;dr: I want to learn how to \"directly\" improve my skill in Physics, by doing and practicing the actual skills necessary for a real-life Physics or Engineering career. What skills and activities do I need to learn and engage in?  \n\n\nThank you so much!",
