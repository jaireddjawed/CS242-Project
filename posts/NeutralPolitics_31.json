        "text": "AG Sessions recently [lifted a ban](http://www.npr.org/2017/08/28/546743742/trump-administration-lifts-limits-on-military-hardware-for-police) on the donation of surplus military hardware to police departments. The ban had been implemented in the wake of Ferguson by the Obama administration, which argued that the equipment gave the impression of law enforcement as a hostile occupying force instead of a community policing effort. AG Sessions disputes this view and believes that the hardware is necessary to protect officers and deter crime. \n\nIs there evidence to support or refute the idea that military hardware makes communities or police officers safer, or reduces crime?\n\nEDIT: As I've learned more about the issue, I realize that my original summary was somewhat inaccurate. Here is a [more precise summary](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/05/18/obama-moves-to-demilitarize-americas-police/), from 2015, of the policy that has just been repealed:\n\n&gt;The [Obama] policy will stop “tanks and other tracked armored vehicles, weaponized aircraft and vehicles, firearms and ammunition measuring .50-caliber and larger, grenade launchers and bayonets” from being given to local police agencies.\n\n&gt;Additionally, the [Obama] policy would attach some restrictions and conditions to the transfer of other equipment, “including armored tactical vehicles like those used in Ferguson, as well as many types of firearms, ammunition and explosives.” These restrictions include requiring the agencies to present “a clear and persuasive explanation of the need for the controlled equipment,” adopt community-oriented policing strategies, agree to “close federal oversight and monitoring overseen by a new federal agency with the power to conduct local compliance reviews,” train officers who will be using the gear, and keep data on how the equipment is used and with what results.",

Cole White worked in CA, which has [laws](http://www.ncsl.org/documents/employ/off-dutyconductdiscrimination.pdf) stipulating that employees cannot be terminated for legal activities outside of work / working hours. As far as I can tell, his actions were repulsive but not illegal (the rally had a [permit](http://www.nbc29.com/story/36115819/judge-grants-injunction-jason-kessler-can-have-unite-the-right-rally-at-emancipation-park)). What leeway do employers have to fire workers in these types of situations? For example, could someone who is straight be fired for participating in a march supporting gay marriage? What are the limits and legal safeguards for employees expressing political views outside of the workplace?\n\nEDIT 4:43pm EDT: There is [evidence](http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/08/13/berkeleys-top-dog-fires-employee-went-white-nationalist-rally/) that he was fired because of his attendance at the rally in Charlottesville, which is much different from a company terminating an employee and declining to give justification. In this case, he was fired explicitly because of his activities.",

But when I check maps like https://libya.liveuamap.com/ I see only two: Tobruk based Russla&amp;Egypt backed one and Tripoli based, UN backed one. (aside from the miscelenious territories like ISIS controlled areas, Lands of Tuareg Tribesmen, and Derna). So where is the 3rd government? Articles often say there are 2 governments in Tripoli but if so where is it, and how does it even work? Are articles  simply outdated and the third government was desolved, conquered or merged with  another?\n\nSome sources of 3 governments include: \nhttps://www.pri.org/stories/2016-03-31/libya-now-has-three-governments-none-which-can-actually-govern\nhttp://www.ecfr.eu/mena/mapping_libya_conflict\n\nNone of them helps Show what happened to the other tripoli based government.

This led to some people mocking and declaring the European Union powerless to do anything of actual importance in relation to the refugee crises.\nThis got me thinking - What can the EU actually do to drastically reduce the number of people coming to European, seeking asylum? I am not talking about deportation or illegals, or of temporary housing situations, while the various civil wars and conflicts are solved. Rather, I am wondering what specifically can be done to deter migrants from even attempting crossing the sea in the first place. Can the EU actually do anything?\nAre there any historical precedents of effective policies that worked on such a large scale over a shorter time? Which tools can the EU apply, that it hasn’t already tried, within a shorter timeframe, say a few years? \n\n",
