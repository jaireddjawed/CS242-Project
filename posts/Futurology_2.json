        "text": "**Skip this part if you know the original experiment:**\n\nSumming up: you have to weight the pros and cons of entering a machine where your body floats in a tank while you live a perfect life in a simulation, without knowing it \"isn't real\". The question is wether you'd enter the machine or stay in your \"real life\". For most people who say they wouldn't enter, there's the counter argument that if someone came up to you right now, in this life, told you that you are already leaving a simulation while you're body is floating in a machine; would you like to leave and go back to your \"real life\" or would you rather stay in this simulation? You'd be less confident in your decision, but even if you wanted to go back, imagine if he told you that in your \"real life\" you're a prisoner in a maximum security prison? Most people would just stay in this life even if it's not \"real\".\n\n**Ok, now the Experience Machine #352 (everyone comes up with a new one):**\n\nIf someone came up to you and said you're in this machine for the last 10 years and if things are not going so well it's because the technology wasn't so advanced when you entered the machine. Also during all these 10 years your brain has been acquiring knowledge on how to set up the perfect life with the newest and best unconscious passive learning technology, while you were inside the machine, floating in the tank.\n\nIf you asked about how was your life before the machine they would tell that they only allow extreme cases of suffering to enter the machine and you were one of those, although they can't disclose all the information.\n\nHe would then ask if you'd prefer to stay here, leave the machine for good to go back to your \"real life\", or just reset the program and reprogram a \"new simulation\" with all you've learnt through all these 10 years. Also independently of your decision they'd ask wether you'd like to remember everything from this life or to erase it all.\n\n**The Twist**\n\nThe twist from the original experiment, as far as I can see, is both that we don't care about how real or not real our life is and that while pain and pleasure are still the most important aspects of life, we're still blindly following status quo bias. I say that because:\n\n1. I imagine that most people wouldn't want to go back to a case of extreme suffering.\n2. I'm assuming a lot of people would prefere to just stay here for loved ones and things like that even if this is a \"simulation\", no one is real, and you can have it 10 times better.\n3. The fact that most people probably wouldn't want to remember anything about this life right now, when heading to the new perfect life also reinforces both 1 and 2. 1: We just seek pleasure and 2: we rather be fooled and happy than know the story and be happy.\n\nBut I'm most uncertain about the third one... I'm not sure the massive majority would rather not remember.",

Other common traits include outgoing personality, high productiveness, **lower body mass index than average** (possibly due to faster metabolism), higher resilience and heightened pain tolerance.\n\n&gt;This condition has no known health complications associated with it. \n\n&gt;It is estimated that approximately 1 to 3 percent of the population has the trait\n\n&amp;#x200B;  \n\nKey facts: the train is **dominant** and results in **lower body mass index than average** (possibly due to faster metabolism). If it's dominant, results in higher productivity and w/out adverse effects, why it is in only 1-3%? My guess is because 100 years ago food was scarce and faster metabolism was not an advantage, now that obesity is more of a problem than hunger, the trait will increase its prevalence  (provided no \"revolutions\" in human development and life) and gradually obesity will be gone. Does above sound reasonable? Please argue with me. TIA",

        "text": "While I was helping my youngest daughter this morning doing her homework, I let my oldest daughter (young teenager) use my computer to discuss with ChatGPT. I had a look at the transcript after, and I was very surprised that after a few minutes, she started talking with ChatGPT about her problems (with her parents mostly, and also a little bit with her friends), and she continued chatting for 30 minutes or so.\n\nThey seemed to have a real conversation (much more interactive than reading advice on the internet), and the advice given, while not very original, was of very decent quality and quite fine-tuned to her situation. She was completely hooked.\n\nI believe teenagers ideally need an 'adult confidant' who is neither a parent nor a teacher, to get advice on life. Typically, a grand-father or uncle / aunt can play this role, and also sport coaches. In the catholic church, confession can also sometimes play this role.\n\nit is important in my opinion to have this adult trusted voice in complement to the discussion with peer teenagers who often do not have the suitable experience to answer questions.\n\nNow, as such adult role models are not always available (and some adults may also setup traps to teenagers acting as a confidant), I feel ChatGPT or comparable AIs could fill an important role in helping teenagers getting 'adult' advice from a third source. I can even imagine tuning an AI like ChatGPT specifically for this purpose.\n\nI would love to know your thoughts.",
