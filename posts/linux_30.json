If more people understand the legit reasons to choose a distro; maybe we'd see less questions about what people assume distros are made for. (and blanket advice just being thrown around)\n\nYes; even a distros like Arch and Gentoo are 'user friendly'. - The people that will refer to a wiki or use a search engine and don't mind some extra hands on and hiccups as a trade-off don't need to start with a 'beginner' distro. People that want GUI everything and a complete setup in 10 minutes will probably never 'level up' because it's simply not for them from the start. -(not because it's 'advanced' user territory).  \n\nThere are also options many don't know about. - New kernels can pose serious problems. There are less problems running an LTS kernel in a rolling release. Distros like Debian have a variants for more up-to-date software. Some people are ok with other package management systems for up-to-date software like flatpak, appimage, or snap without causing dependency hell issues.",

The guide tells me to mount the root partition to /mnt. I'm already confused by this; from my understanding (which I figure is wrong); isn't /mnt and everything else a part of the root partition to begin with? What exactly am I doing by mounting my root partition to /mnt. I'm using the command  \n\n\n    $ mount /dev/volgroup0/lv_root /mnt \n\nThis confused me in and of itself. However, the next step seems to be to mount the home partition to /mnt/home. Okay, having accepted the root partition is mounted to /mnt ; since root is now /mnt...wouldn't any directory created inside the /mnt directory be a part of the root partition? How is it a independent partition? I used the command   \n\n\n    $ mkdir /mnt/home\n$ mount /dev/volgroup0/lv_home /mnt/home\n\nI'm certain I don't understand how it all works properly. I'd love some help understanding what exactly is going on. Thanks!",

So I looked it up on YouTube and saw a method where I just typed in a command and then a password 8 to 16 characters long which I then use in the bios. I did all that but the Fucking bios says that my password is incorrect. I did this a few times but it didn’t work. So I thought that I maybe have to press arrow right instead of enter when I typed in the password in the bios. So i changed the password again and wanted to enter the bios WHICH DOESNT OPEN ANYMORE.\n\nConclusion: I just wasted 2 h of my life because I just want to fucking use my Nvidia gpu as Standard gpu.",

The ability to \" run linux in windows \" for me is interesting but I struggle to think of something interesting to use it for (maybe because I'm fairy new to linux). What are your thoughts about WSL? Do you think it can be used to run a sort of hybrid system? Do you have any interesting ideas or projects for WSL?",

The reinstall was just a huge pain with so many apps and configuration of my environment that I wanted to make sure I kept atleast 2 full disk clones of the latest configuration of my daily driver of rocky linux 9.1.\n\nI installed rocky linux with custom partitioning on the sandisk SSD and cloned it using clonezilla (to an image on a disk. the other option would have been cloning it to a disk). Then I tried to restore the image on a kingston 480 GB SSD to make sure that the the restore could be doned back to any new SSD. The cloning and restoring go without a hitch but I cannot boot the system with the kingston SSD. Both disks are the same size but different brands. Has anybody gone through with these issues? Researching it on the internet comes up with similar problems but no clear solutions. Not sure on how to proceed at this point. I did not want to use \"dd\" to copy out the disk since it would take up so much space with it making an exactly similar sized backup of a 480 GB disk. Any help is appreciated. thanks\n\no",

Now, one of my few complaints is that the default software center, Pop Shop, is quite buggy and freezes almost every time I try to update my system or install an application. This I found funny  given that that's the main purpose  of the app, but anyways, this got me looking for its replacement. My preference would be a software center that allows you to choose between the version of packages you would like to install (flatpak, deb, snap, etc...) and that it also includes proprietary software in their library.",

I wrote the title because I work at a third party computer/laptop store and the owner told me that a long time ago he had dealt in Linux laptops ( certified Linux laptops ) and it simply caused him to lose money. Now after pandemic, seeing somewhat rising market share of linux desktop we decided to do an experiment.\nWe installed few Linux distros like Fedora, Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Linux Mint and Manjaro gnome on some old second hand laptops lije thinkpads ( laptops with integrated graphics so no nvidia issues ) and tested them so everything worked properly. Now whenever a customer came to buy those laptops we gave them a brief demo on how to use it like what to expect, how to use, how to install software, how to update and some basic stuff. Now here is what we found out:\nReturn rates on these laptops were insanely high like 6-7 times more than windows laptops with Kubuntu and Linux Mint ones somewhat less than Gnome ones. Thankfully they had no warranty so we basically installed windows 10 and sent them back. Two big reasons we found out for them getting returned back were:\nLack of Software and User Experience. There were very few software that they needed and open source alternatives if available were just not up to the mark. Usability was also a big issue and they couldn't do much unless they wanted to learn how to use terminal. Now I know terminal makes everything easy but it is for those who have technical knowledge and know how. For non tech people, using Linux is very hard unless there is someone with them to guide them. That is why most hardware companies simply don't want to spend money on pre-installing Linux because the potential customer base is very low. I hope you guys won't take this post in a bad way.",

There is a [page for WSA](https://github.com/microsoft/WSA), but it's mainly just for bug reports and discussion.\n\nTo my understanding GPLv2 requires any modifications to be accessible to the public and in an [excerpt from gnu.org](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/android-and-users-freedom.en.html), it states:\n\n&gt;Within Android, Linux the kernel remains a separate program, with its source code under GNU GPL version 2. To combine Linux with code under the Apache 2.0 license would be copyright infringement, since GPL version 2 and Apache 2.0 are incompatible.\n\nSo the kernels for both WSA and WSL2 should be under the same license. \n\nIs Microsoft allowed to not disclose the kernel source of WSA for over half a year? I've tried asking for the source on the official WSA subreddit, contacting them through the email on their third party disclosure page, and others have asked through the WSA github page, all to no response so far.",

Given that it may be merged this year, what are any users experiences with the Filesystem.  I this really going to be the  ZFS / BTRFS killer?",

        "text": "Hi all, I was planning a build on AMDs 7900X3D but after reading through AMDs announcement on this chip yesterday, it seems AMD has made some interesting design choices and I’m not sure how this would play out in Linux. \n\nI only have a basic grasp of the issue, so bear with me. The 7900 and 7950 3D SKUs seem to only put the extra cache on one of the two chiplets. This chiplet (the one with more cache) will run slower than the other. This introduces some complexity where the kernel would have two manage scheduling across two different vectors, clock speed and cache miss. I suspect (don’t know really) this will require more work on scheduling. \n\nThere is a lot of discussion about this related to Windows in the AMD subreddit, but I’m curious what the Linux community thinks about this. Do you think this design will cause performance issues on Linux? If extra work is required to change scheduling to support this design, how long would that take post launch (I’m not looking for specifics of course, just trying to understand how things like this have played out in the past)?",
