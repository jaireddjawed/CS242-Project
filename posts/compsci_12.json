        "text": "Hi all, first of all I don't have an academic CS background so please forgive me if I am not up to date on the latest research. I am interested in program synthesis and where it is going, but lots of the debates I see online (HN etc) seem to descend into the usual GOFAI vs. ML fights and I lack the background to determine what seems credible.\n\nMy understanding is that until recently program synthesis focused on generating correct programs from example test cases by search or maybe ILP etc. To be honest, it seems that this didn't get very far. I have seen references to Flash Fill in Excel but I am not aware of anything else with large scale adoption or that can generate more that small algorithms (is this incorrect?).\n\nRecently, systems such as Copilot use ML to generate likely code from prompts. The problem is that the model doesn't 'really understand' the output code and often it is incorrect or doesn't compile. Still, Copilot seems to have provided utility. On the other hand, GOFAI proponents might say that Copilot doesn't even know how to output correct code.\n\nI have read ML proponents argue that more data and better models usually lead to a more capable system. For example, I believe GPT-3 can do arithmetic that GPT-2 couldn't do. However, Copilot has already been trained on all of Github's public code. Where would further data come from? I am aware that places like Salesforce have been using RL with test cases to improve results, but even so they are only getting 40% correct with 1000 attempts. Will better model architectures alone lead to much better results?",

Investigating further into them led to the answer being that **data origin authentication** (DAO) are provided by the primitives.\n\nNow DAO is defined as \"the source of the information being verified\", providing integrity through MAC. Yet Non-repudiation is almost defined as the same thing, in which it provides proof of the origin and the creator of said data being **unable to deny** that they created the data.  \n\nIf they both say the same thing, then why is it that some sources state that authenticated primitives do not in fact have non-repudiation when they do? Some say that the seperate primitives that **are combined** result in non-repudiation being created, but I am so genuinely confused at what I'm supposed to take from this.",
