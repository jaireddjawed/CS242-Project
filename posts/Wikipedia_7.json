The AI model can be used to generate a summary for a 5-year-old:\n\n*Differential calculus is a way of finding out how something changes. It helps us figure out how fast something is changing, like how fast a car is going or how quickly the temperature is rising. It uses equations and graphs to figure out the rate of change.*\n\nOr it can be used to generate a summary for someone who is more familiar with calculus:\n\n*Differential calculus is a branch of calculus that deals with the study of the rates at which quantities change. It is concerned with the study of the properties of functions and their derivatives, which are used to describe the rates of change of the functions. Differential calculus is used to solve problems in many fields, including physics, engineering, economics, and biology.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think about this?\n\nDo you think this could be useful for other?\n\nAny feedback is appreciated.

Having to scroll all the way up on the page to change the language of a site (and not just with one click, oh no, we have to open a drop-down menu first) is getting really annoying really fast. Not to mention that the site still does not respect the button to have it take the whole width of the page like a normal website. If I wanted to see the mobile site I would just add the \"m.\" to the address, please revert this cancer.",
