The AI model can be used to generate a summary for a 5-year-old:\n\n*Differential calculus is a way of finding out how something changes. It helps us figure out how fast something is changing, like how fast a car is going or how quickly the temperature is rising. It uses equations and graphs to figure out the rate of change.*\n\nOr it can be used to generate a summary for someone who is more familiar with calculus:\n\n*Differential calculus is a branch of calculus that deals with the study of the rates at which quantities change. It is concerned with the study of the properties of functions and their derivatives, which are used to describe the rates of change of the functions.
