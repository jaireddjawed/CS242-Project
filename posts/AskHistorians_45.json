Was there a decline in Africa by the time the 1800s came around and if so why was that? Why was there no empire like the Mali or Congo kingdoms with the power to push back European colonization? From what I understand (which is very little) the Europeans were able to just show up with a few thousand soldiers and some modern boats and just take all the land everywhere in the continent (apart from Ethiopia) with little to no resistance. I understand that guns may have played a large part but why did no African country have armies numbering in the hundreds of thousands like the European states of the time which could have easily crushed any attempt of colonization?",

This is not the first time the latter phenomenon has happened.\n\nI would like to suggest two new regulations:\n\n1. [The plagiarism rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_no_plagiarism) should explicitly state that using chatbots to write answers is akin to plagiarism. (I'm not sure if that would have stopped this answer which provided a randomly Googled bibliography and seems to have been created for the user's childish entertainment/trolling, but it would be good to specify this anyway.)\n2. Perhaps when there is *really* good content in the replies to deleted bad answer, there should be a default mod post alerting readers to this fact. I know that's not exactly the style of moderation here but it is a good way to make writers' hard work visible.",

I don't know how to choose, and I was hoping someone could give me some guidance. \n\nHere's a list of preferences, I'm sorry if they're quite random:\n\n* I am particularly interested in the situation of Turkish, Iranian, Azerbaijani and Central Asian Muslims, which I understand is a small minority of American Muslims. \n* Anything that might focus more on the South or the state of Illinois would be really helpful\n* I am more interested in Shi'a Islam than in Sunni Islam.\n\nI recognize that no one book is likely to fulfill all of these requirements, I'm just asking which book might be the most relevant to my interests as described here. It doesn't need to be a general-interest book, I enjoy reading academic texts and I have a lot of faith in my local library's ability to acquire weird books for me.",

People are falling all around you or even yourself in the first, second, third volleys.  Twenty seconds while you wait for death could be harrowing for the next volley to come.\n\nBut if you had extra rifles per infantryman, besides the very first volley, you'd have a great advantage being able to fire two or three times in quick succession, leveling the enemy ranks while they are desperately reloading after their first shot.\n\nIt would seem to me that a good chunk of the enemy formation would be decimated before they were even able to fire their second shot, meaning the actual returning volley from the enemy would be much less and thus less of your own troops in return would be wounded or killed.  So your actual first reloading volley, maybe the fifth volley, would keep whittling them down in fighting men much faster.  Was this ever done?\n\nAnd I suppose I am referring to the time of the Revolutionary War or even the Civil War give or take.  Muskets, muzzle loaders, etc.  Anything that would require a lengthy reload.  I've heard ship captains carrying multiple pistols and maybe boarding parties.

Sometimes, I think this is referred to as \"chicken\" but not always. The basic gist of the game is whoever is the bigger coward will jump out of the car first as it approaches the cliff. Inevitably, in the fictional representations, the one who \"wins\" by staying in the car longest ends up getting trapped in the car somehow and dies as the car goes over the cliff and crashes on the rocks below.\n\nHere is a scene from The Heavenly Kid to illustrate. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ns4WuGyc4uk\n\nMy question is, are there any documented cases of this \"game\" ever actually happening in American from say 1940-1990?

        "text": "I'm taking a US history course on \"defiant women\" and we just discussed the life of Molly Brant, a Mohawk \"woman-in-between\" who was able to gain power as a clan mother in Mohawk society, as well as a widow in early colonial British society. Her unique position allowed her to take on traditionally male tasks in both spheres; she benefitted from matrilineal kinship along with legally claiming herself as a \"relict\" of her deceased European husband. For example, her considerable influence over the Iroquois Confederacy enabled her to perform duties usually reserved for male chiefs, like redistributing food/goods and choosing whether to send men into battle. Part of this unique power came from her ability to mediate with the English and create networks of goods and support across the two spheres. Connections with the colonial government enabled her to formally educate her children and possess money to manage the redistribution of goods among her people.\n\nI'm wondering about other examples of women in a male-dominated society who creatively took advantage of their limited, informal power for their own gain-- essentially, how did women game a system that actively sought to subjugate them? I included this colonial example but am also interested in other circumstances, so I'm trying to pose this as a more general question. It could be an example of a singular woman who stands out, or perhaps a group of women who created a trend over time. \n\nThank you very much! I hope this is clear enough and I am excited to read any replies.",

To put it plainly, most of the text I have seen on Mediterranean diets is by public health academics, not Mediterraneans.\n\nIn particular, the emphasis on whole grains feels dubious. (Anecdotally, I have seen a few clips of the \"Pasta Grannies\" show, and the pasta is of course always made with white flour.) I am under the impression that for much of post-Industrial history, refined grains have been preferred to whole grains because they last much longer, whereas fat outside the endosperm part of the grain is prone to rancidity.",
