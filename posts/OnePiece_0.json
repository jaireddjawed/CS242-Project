        "text": "Something historical is about to play out Egghead and I'd like to share some ideas on what could eventually happen.\n\n1. The Strawhats fail to protect the island and are forced to flee either on their own or with Stella Vegapunk. This incident would once again show the world how far the government is willing to go if anyone dares to research the Void Century.\n\n2. This has already been speculated by other users on the sub, but i really like this idea: Luffy calls upon the Grand Fleet and takes on Kizaru and his fleet. The narrator already said that the Grand Fleet will be involved in a historical event and perhaps that event is the \"Egghead Island Incident\". It would also be a great way to even out the playing field because Kizaru is coming with over a hundred marine ships.\n\n3. The Revolutionaries show up and claim their first big victory by capturing one of the Gorosei. We know that Kuma is already on his way to Egghead and perhaps Sabo could show up with an army of his own if he survived the destruction of Lulusia. Dragon himself could also show up if he happens to have some sort of wind logia that would allow him to reach Egghead in time.\n\nDo you have other ideas? Please let me know.",

His Hito Hito no Mi could by default make a storm around him and he be 'god of the Rain'.   \nGod of the earth's a little trickier for me but my best guess here is the world government is the only civilization to retain knowledge of these fruits and have possession of the Hito Hito no Mi for the earth.  \n\n\nAny fellow theorists want to bounce ideas off this?...",

        "text": "I've seen it in many threads and asked about it multiple times myself: How do Luffy's powers work within the context of him being a zoan fruit user?    \n\nTo see the problem, let's first look at what is established about Zoan users:  \nThey initially have at least two forms. Their original form, and their full beast form. The full beast form is easy to access, so much so that Momo did it accidentally. Depending on their mastery of the power, they will also be able to use at least one, sometimes multiple, hybrid forms. None of these forms so far draw stamina or exhaust the user in any way.  \nWith full mastery of the power, the user will also gain an awakened form. A sort of super hybrid with flame patterns and a hagoromo made if clouds. \n\nGiven this, a Nika zoan should initially give the user a full Nika form they could easily access. Then a hybrid nika form, and only then an awakened 'super' nika form.    \n\nThat means two things in the case of Luffy:   \n\n1. His awakened form isn't actually a Nika. It's superior to a Nika. It's not just a Nika in the same way that Lucci's awakening is not just a Leopard.     \n\n2. Somehow it has to explained where the easily accessible Zoan forms went.   \n\nI've seen some suggestions on the second one. The most promising ones being:    \n\n-that there are no hybrid or full beast forms in case of humans who have eaten a human human fruit. However, that would imply that Sengoku's huge Buddha form was actually an awakening and Oda significantly changed how he wanted to draw awakenings.  \nIt's also a bit weird if no such forms exist. After all, individual humans do have significant differences between each other.    \n\n-that Nika just looked a lot like Luffy. So much so, that nobody notices the differences between his forms.",

And sure enough, after Sentomaru is out CP0 takes control over the seraphim.\n\nReminder that Sentomaru is above CP0 (with an authority chip). The order goes Gorosei &gt; VPs &gt; Sentomaru &gt; anyone with an authority chip (Ch. 1069).\n\nIs that a blatant plothole?",

Now don’t get me wrong I think turning ppl into toys is very sick power and being able to control them makes sense as you ‘play’ with toys but eternal youth? Making ppl forget them? I think making people remember there loved ones and knowing that they’re slaves would’ve added an extra edge. And maybe the eternal youth thing might be important in the next part?\n\nAlso I don’t know if this was addressed but what about picture or notes or drawings or anything to do with that person are they just erased? And surely if everyone else has a dad, surely you realise that you should have one too? And what about gaps in pictures if these people are erased? surely people would be like that’s odd?\n\nJust some thoughts let me know!",

It is said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Recently, I was rewatching the original Yu-Gi-Oh! anime as a tribute to the author who tragically passed away last year while attempting to save three people from drowning. While watching the first episode, I noticed  \"the symbol of friendship.\" Tea drew the symbol on their hands and explained that if they were ever alone, they could think of the symbol and remember their friendship, giving them strength. Although the ink would eventually wear off, the memory of the symbol would remain in their hearts.\n\nSimilarly, One Piece also showcased a similar gesture of camaraderie when the Straw Hats silently bid farewell to Vivi by showing her their 'X' marks. The mark was a symbol of their bond and even though it eventually faded away, it remained in their hearts as a testament to their friendship.",

This obviously means that the people she would hate the most in the one piece world are Shirahoshi, Boa and Nami (Nami is the only one in straw hats). When she sees Nami in the final fight, she wont let anyone kill her but her. \n\nBesides that there are some similarities between the characters. Nami is known as a cat burglar and is known to be very sneaky, calculated and tricky and we have also seen Catarina can be smart and sneaky when she transforms into a guy and tricks him when they unveil her fruit (bad with names lol and have a \\*\\*\\*\\* memory) . She was even given the kitsune Zoan mythic devil fruit which is a trickster spirit. I believe Oda is gonna set up a battle of wits and trickery between them as we both know they have illusions (transformations).\n\nOne funny connection I also noted is that  Catarinas devil fruits is known as the dog dog fruit and Nami has been associated with cat many times in the manga and Oda drew a cat as Namis spirit animal in of the cover pages, Nami's name on the wanted poster is even CAT burglar Nami. This could have been done by Oda to mimic the rivalry/hate between cats and dogs and how they just but heads and don't like each other because catarina hates beautiful women. \n\nWhat do you guys think and how much stronger do you think Nami needs to become to scale around catarina? \n\nsorry for any grammar mistakes",

Luffy is the worst card for his enemies lol.\n\nOne Piece can be read as “a fool’s journey to Laugh Tale” or something in that arena idk. Or something about Luffy being the fool who reverses the world by taking risks and developing throughout his journey. The last card in the major arcana is The World. Change starts with Luffy (“a fool”) and ends with changes to the world, like major arcana.\n\nYeehaw",

        "text": "I believe in Episode 264, Toei actually showed us a glimpse of the treasure: One Piece. It was the moment Luffy had commented that there is an empty town in Enies Lobby. \n\n[Empty Town in Enies Lobby](https://i.redd.it/lq5xtio2t7oa1.gif)\n\nI believe Enies Lobby was the Ancient Kingdom before it was taken over by the World Government. The World Government probably decided to station a stronghold here to ensure that if someone were to somehow return the land back to its original form that the World Government would be there to stop them.\n\n[The Ancient Kingdom is the One Piece](https://preview.redd.it/cpxu9rblr7oa1.jpg?width=365&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ac680388d1a0fa3062c445e59ff99d07fa0c6009)\n\nSo the question is: why does Enies Lobby look different than the Ancient King we have seen being visualized in the past? Why is there a giant hole hole around Enies Lobby? \n\nImu.\n\nI believe Imu was targeting the Ancient Kingdom with the destructive power we had seen in Chapter 1060, where a country ceased to exist. With the same destructive power, it created the giant hole that surrounds Enies Lobby!\n\n[Imu's Devastating Power](https://preview.redd.it/ilimaj61u7oa1.jpg?width=1665&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=61df4943b5bd444f1318570958e0d23fd6793db7)\n\nSo why does the middle part of the country still remain? I believe this is where Joyboy and Imu were physically fighting so Imu did not target himself. He was targeting the land around him.\n\nSo I believe in the moment of crisis, Joyboy used his devil fruit power to move the targeted part of the country out of harm's way, and shrunk it the same way we have seen Luffy shrink his body. We have also seen Luffy use Gear 5 to morph the land around him. While Joyboy was moving the land, in a comedic fashion, Zunesha accidentally swallowed the land!\n\nYes! Zunesha is the reason why the last island doesn't have a log pose! The 4 Red Poneglyphs do not physically point to One Piece. They instead tell a story where the One Piece is. It's inside Zunesha, and Zunesha needs to poop it out! That's why Zunesha has been \"punished\" for 800 years to roam the sea. That's why it's called Laugh tale!\n\n[Poo the size of an Island](https://preview.redd.it/7aqsvp5ew7oa1.png?width=483&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3ce7a90b5e0efccd3b5beff703f7afab8cfd8fc8)\n\nThank you for reading :)\n\nJust in case you haven't read my theory as to why I believe the One Piece is the Ancient Kingdom that disappeared feel free to read it here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/y3fre7/theory\\_what\\_is\\_the\\_one\\_piece\\_and\\_will\\_of\\_d\\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/y3fre7/theory_what_is_the_one_piece_and_will_of_d_a/)",

However, we are yet to see a character with lunarian DNA successfully withstand an attack infused with advanced conquerors or advanced armament haki. In chapter 1035, when we are about to get the definitive answer to that question, King the Wildfire seemingly dodges an ACoC infused attack, despite being \"ignited\". What do you think? Are lunarians immune to advanced conquerors and advanced armament haki or are they as vulnerable to it as any other race?",
