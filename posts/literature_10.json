Allow me to enlighten you. \n\nSo you take an adult, usually single, that is going about their life. They may or may not feel lonely but are sure in their station. Introduce children! For one reason or another they are forced to take care of usually, but not limited to, an absolute gaggle of kids. They begin their journey reluctant and overwhelmed. The story is one of coming together and realizing that they can’t imagine a life without these kids. It’s called Surprise Children but the real surprise is that they already loves them. Often there is a plot point in which the children are temporarily taken away. \n\nI’ve seen it primarily in movies (Raising Helen, Despicable Me, etc) \n\nBest example in lit? The House in the Cerulean Sea. \n\nWhat’s your favorite instance of Surprise Children?",

        "text": "***Spoilers for Henry James’ “The Turn of the Screw”***\n\nSo I am a little over halfway through reading Henry James’ “The Turn of the Screw” for the first time. I know that interpretations of this story tend to vary, typically ending up in one of two camps:\n\nCamp 1: The governess was truly seeing ghosts the entire time.\n\nOr\n\nCamp 2: The governess suffered a mental break and fabricated the whole experience.\n\nHowever, the more I read this book, I can’t help but wonder if there’s a third camp, which is, “Henry James was just really bad at writing female protagonists”. The governess is so excitable and it doesn’t seem to take much for her to get worked up, much less get Mrs. Grose worked up when she recounts her experiences. Additionally, she seems to jump to conclusions rather abruptly. I could be struggling to follow the material but it seems to me as if she jumps rather quickly to assumptions. Like, what evidence did she have to assume that Peter Quint was after Miles after seeing his ghost in the window? Or that both the ghosts of Peter Quint and Ms. Jessel were after Miles and Flora to “corrupt” them? It seems that she just “knows” in these situations and lands firmly on that standpoint. And then Mrs. Grose is just… convinced.\nI can entirely see why many readers believe she was experiencing a mental break or mania of some kind, however, to me it just feels like poor writing.\n\nThis is the only other piece of work I’ve read besides “The Gift of the Magi” and I was considering reading more of his work after I finish “Turn”. However, I’m a little hesitant to do so after reading this story.\n\nI’m open to opinions/suggestions/context in the comments!",

        "text": "(reposting from my r/books thread)\n\nI loved Crime and Punishment, it's got amazing prose and beautifully written characters. But the general moral of the story is that Raskolnikov's godless utilitarianism leads only to a life of torment and spiritual unfulfillment. This is seen at the end where Raskolnikov is saved by Sonya and after spending time in prison he finds God and everything. It's an incredible journey, but one that is explicitly polemical.\n\nMy deepest problem with the book is the character of Lizaveta. Lizaveta is killed alongside the pawnbroker woman after she walks in on the murder scene. Unlike the pawnbroker (at least in Raskolnikov's worldview), she is pure and innocent and doesn't fall under Raskolnikov's own definitions of who 'deserves' to die. I feel like the novel would be a lot better if this character did not exist, and if the novel was instead concerned purely with the question of whether killing the pawnbroker was right.\n\nThe consequence of Lizaveta existing in the story is that no sane human would believe Raskolnikov was in the right. And that Raskolnikov's guilt is competely understandable considering he's just killed an innocent woman. This means that when Raskolnikov finds God, it's seen as a much more palatable response to this guilt. In other words, the utilitarian ideology of Raskolnikov isn't even discussed, rather it's just the complete cut-and-dry immorality of murdering an innocent, a much more easier thing to criticise.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? I've looked all over the internet but Lizaveta is never given any consideration. Do you think Dostoevsky made Raskolnikov deliberately more guilty so he could drive his ideology further? Or do you think the character is fine as it is?",

        "text": "English is not my first language, and I apologize if there are any linguistic discrepancies. \n\nThe review/analysis\n\nThe book begins with the representation of humans through the drunk, crabby farmer, Mr Jones. He is soon driven out of his farm by the animals, and a new leader in Napoleon is reinstated. However, soon things begin to change as a gradual humanization of the pigs takes place (walking on hind legs, living in the farmhouse etc). \n\nALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL BUT SOME ARE MORE EQUAL THAN THE OTHERS\n\nAnimal Farm is a moving narrative situated in the Manor Farm that undergoes several revolutions and battles, striving for equality, only to be betrayed by their own. \n\nThis subtle and not-so-subtle narrative and criticism of Joseph Stalin and the Western silence was subjected to brutal criticism and censorship during the time it was written. Published in 1945, this novella explores the trajectory of the \"higher\" and the \"lower\" animals and the humanization and dehumanization of the said higher animals. \n\nThe narrator pervades throughout the novel and surfaces in his judgment of the animals. While reading the book, I found it to be less subtle and more obvious. The narration at some point morphed into blatant judgment (not complaining). However, this judgment and not-so-subtle satire pulled me out of the story at times. It became obvious that this is not a story, but an account based on real people. The narrator pops to the surface at all times, screaming at the reader's face, wanting him/her to realize the political dystopia that we are living under. It seemed as if Orwell was pleading for a revolution himself. \n\nBoxer, the hardworking horse represents the diligent, hardworking class of Russia. Their lives end in tragic manners, without seeing any ray of hope for the future. His ending made me sob. He is probably my favorite character out of everyone. \n\nThis takes me to my next point and that is the point of view of the \"lower\" animals. It was so freaking frustrating to see them being fooled by Squealer. Benjamin angered me the most. He could have said something, but no!!! He did not. I understand to some extent why he did not, but I was very glad when he read the sign on the van that came to pick up Boxer. The uneasiness and awkwardness among the animals formed a moving narrative. I was very much at the edge, waiting for something to happen, but it didn't. None of them dared to speak up, or they were foolish enough to not realize what was happening. \n\nThe ending was harrowing. I felt so bad for the animals who were viewing from a distance, the \"humanization\" of the pigs. I understand that we use \"humanity\" in a positive light, however, I believe that Orwell wanted to present a darker side of humanity. The metamorphosis of the pigs into humans and the humans into pigs was hilarious, but with an undertone of melancholy. \n\nIt is often the case when people like us are exploited by the people in authority. The book is still very much relevant, despite communism being uncommon. The self-proclaimed sympathizers on the internet are the perfect example of this. I believe everyone should read this book and try to understand how capitalism and communism, both, like the \"humans\" and the \"pigs\" are harmful to us. All in all, I would rate the book a clean 8.5 out of 10. It would have been a ten if I got to see the animals revolting against the pigs, but maybe this is how it is. We are in a constant state of illusion, fooled by pigs like Napoleon. \n\nI hope you enjoyed this review! Let me know what you guys think, I would love to discuss it :)",

        "text": "This is an appreciation post for the best book I read in 2022, and one of the best books I've *ever* read: Will and Testament by Vigdis Hjorth. \n\nThis book feels profoundly different from others that touch on similar subject matter. Most books about abusive families that I've read or heard of exoticize the abusers in ways that flatter the presumed readerbase and make escape from the family also a move upward in class: the abuser is a dumb brute of a man who beats the hmother and children after coming home stumbling drunk, and there's never enough money and the house is a mess. Or they're in a bizarre religious cult. Or the abuser has a mental illness of some sort. That's why I never read Educated or My Absolute Darling, despite seeing lots of praise for both: they're probably good books, but it was way too easy for me to picture some real pedophiles I know picking them up, probably on recommendation from the NY Times which they subscribe to, and thinking, \"those crazy backwards right-wingers.\" Will and Testament offers no such comfort. It's about a respectable bourgeois family, perfectly able and willing to protect their own good reputation by dismissing their daughter's claims. A \"normal\" family.\n\nAnother difference is that Will and Testament isn't really *about* abuse. Very little page time is devoted to describing the abusive acts themselves; those looking for evidence of \"trauma porn\" will be severely disappointed. Far more page time is devoted to describing how everyone deals with it, the damage done years after the physical acts, the family cover-up, and the larger questions raised of guilt and forgiveness. Hjorth said in an interview that this was her most political novel, and while it's far too interior to be a political novel in the usual sense, I see what she means. The last quarter of the book, in fact, is full of passages relating the family dynamics to the dynamics of international politics, to countries at war and countries attempting \"truth and reconciliation\". \n\nThe writing style here is simple, with very little in the way of metaphors or other writerly flourishes. Some writers, like Scott Fitzgerald or Toni Morrison, are like musicians or poets; Hjorth is not. But her writing is not pedestrian at all, it's a skilled attempt to portray with absolute transparency the way the mind works when going over a thought. The style reminded me a little bit of Hemingway in its minimalism, but really it's entirely her own. I kept on bookmarking passages with important insights, almost as one might do with a self help book or a textbook, but the difference being that these insights are discovered by the main character along with the reader, it never feels like someone on high preaching their superior wisdom at you. And the cumulative effect of the work is surprisingly moving. It feels neither unrelentingly bleak nor like the idealized cookie-cutter \"recovery story\", but simply like a real-time view into the mind of a real person. \n\nReading Will and Testament has gotten me interested in reading more Scandinavian realist literature: more Hjorth obviously, but also Tove Ditlevsen and some of the other authors referenced in the book who seem well known in Northern Europe but not much beyond there. And of course Knausegard, once I have the stamina to tackle a six volume magnum opus!",

By some ones and zeros. \n\nSo now I'm completely freaked out. Is storytelling the next victim of AI?  Am I reading too much into this?  Is it actually nothing but a funny prank or a social experiment? \n\nCould this be a beginning of a dystopian nightmare?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/zzu745/loss_of_face_has_face_descriptions_gone_out_of/",
        "text": "Nowadays, we are “feeling squeamish in judging a person’s character on the evidence of how that person looks,” and “conclusions based on physiognomy and professions of beauty just don’t seem plausible anymore; they have acquired a creepy voyeuristic overtone,” says C. Baxter in the last chapter of *The Art of Subtext* and this could be one of the reasons why writers no longer describe the face of the characters at lengths. The other reason is that “readers will tend to get impatient with any lengthy introductory descriptions of facial or physical attributes” (except in romance &amp; niche genres).\n\nAnd we’re more “likely to get an initial sense of who a person is from his accessories, not from his face.”\n\nBaxter’s point is that face descriptions have faded out by the 1920s or 1930s, except for the grotesque and the unsightly. Example with Popeye in William Faulkner’s *Sanctuary*, 1931.\n\nBefore this turning point, we have a more systematic characterization of the appearance, like Dickens practiced. He also cites Thomas Hardy’s peculiar description of Thomasin, in *The Return of the Native*, 1878, which can make readers cringe even if they are used to his style.\n\nAnd after that, “Saul Bellow is one of the last holdouts for a tradition of literature portraiture that goes back to Charles Dickens and Henry Fielding.”\n\nThat said, and maybe this does not really qualify as a face descriptions in the sense of the person’s identity or base appearance, Baxter cites Paula Fox’s *The Widow’s Children* for its scene with a series of face closeups which creates a dramatic staging full of tension. Readers parse specific face expressions which are segmented.\n\nAnd conveniently enough, some faces are able to give away clues because of the alcohol.\n\nOtherwise, we might have fallen back to the unreadability of the guarded people, wearing masks.\n\nAnd this last point comes from what Walt Whitman, in *Democratic Vistas* (1871), calls “an epidemic of unnaturalness and the insincerity of the business class, in which the confidence-man, the trickster, and the seductress would thrive.” (Baxter’s words)\n\nWe now have for everyone a “professional masking at work in a mass society.”\n\nWith this consequence: “What is bound to arise in a culture of this type is literature about knavery and deceit, particularly deceitful charm, from *The Confidence-Man*, through *Adventures of Huckleberry Finn* up to *The Day of the Locust* and *The Great Gatsby*”\n\nThe last point that worries me a bit is when Baxter insists on what Whitman calls “cheerful simplicity” that has been lost forever, and Baxter states our time has become “post-face”.\n\nI’m curious about what you think about these views. I hope I’ve quoted enough context.",
