Yes, the fcking Gorosei. Its very likely that Oda had these five elders as the inspiration for the Gorosei.   \n\n\nWhat if, Immu is supposed to be the \"dying\" feudal lord and is using the five gorosei to prepare his successor?   \n\n\nOr maybe he DOESNT WANT someone to succeed him, and prob THERE IS someone whos supposed to.   \n\n\nWhat if the the D clan was supposed to be the true heir to some very important treasure, and was overthrown of their heritage when the World Gov was founded. Maybe they were usurped from this treasure. And maybe there is someone from the D clan who is supposed to be the one to re-claim it, and the Gorosei knows that (Shanks??????????)  \n\n\nIm just fooling around with you guys, but prob Oda is in fact using this japanese historical reference (as he already did many times). We just dont know how its gonna be yet.",

        "text": "So here they are :  \n1- BB vs Law . \n\nI think that Garp , Big Mom pirates (maybe not Kata but someone like Cracker or Oven maybe) will join the fight in order to free Coby and Pudding. I think we will get to see a all out BB real power who will show it after these two forces arrive. Law will be on the brick of defeat and Garp will showcase some of his true power in order to fight BB . BB will be shown to have an edge ,but will be betrayed by Aokiji..\n\n2- Shanks vs Kidd.\n\nWell there is no going back , there is no stoppage until one of these two is dead ,not defeated but dead. Shanks lit let it known that this time they would not settle with just the arm but with the life and on the other hand it is Kidd who's only life goal seem to be to kill Shanks (or Benn to be more precise)\n\nI think this fight will be shown for sure , unlike the BB and Law fight that might be shown from time to time how it has proceeded and will most likely continue off panel. The reason this fight will be shown is that no matter the outcome we are either going to see the first and last fight of Shanks or we will see the flashback of Kidd and the death of the second D character.\n\nMy prediction on this one is that Shanks will stick by his word and be the one to finish Kidd off. There is a huge power gap between these two imo and it is really clear tbh . \n\nThe only way Kidd lives(aka \"wins\") is if Shanks senses smth weird(unique) about Kidd's kings haki . Maybe hinting that Kidd is from the royal family who ruled ancient kingdom. That would be interesting tbh.\n\n3- Egghead situation\n\nI think this is the arc where Lucci reasoning starts to change tbh . Idk I have a feeling Vegapunk has something to do with making the CP agents follow every order that they take from WG and will help Lucci become more human \n\nWhen the crew gets ready to set sail they will need to go through all the wg ships that have been placed outside the island + Kizaru and VA's . Imo this will be the second time we see the sky turn green and the ships get wrecked. I think Dragon will go to Egghead after the conversation he had with Vegapunk. Dragon would try not to miss the chance of killing one of the Goroseis ,but imo serphamint of Kuma will be ordered to teleport the Gorosei back to marineford . And yes I believe this is the end of the line for Kizaru ,unless the biggest plot twist in OP history is pulled and Kizaru turns out to be a rev. \n\nDragon is sure to start a all out open war with the WG now with 4 commanders being average and his 2nd in command being either dead(and most likely will only be re shown when Imu is revealed with the flashback of Sabo talking about him) . Now Dragon surly has to have so strong secret members in order to be able to go to war with WG and Kizaru might just be the guy tbh . Sometimes you need to act as a fool in order to fool everyone. I know this is too far fetched :P.\n\nEither way it is time to see the downfall of a navy admiral in duty and see how the navy would response and react.\n\n4-Kuma sitaution\n\nImo Kuma is going in a kamikaze mission in order to smh free the way to mariejois so the final invasion of the Mariejois starts right after Egghead. \n\n\\*For you who might mention Elbaf and Laughtale. Maybe after the final battle Luffy will go to bury Shanks in Elbaf , where he will be led to the last phoneglyph(maybe Shanks has already instructed the people of Elbaf to lead Luffy to it) and then he will go to Laugh tale.",

        "text": "The idea stems from what we've seen and know of kizaru.\n\n1. Kizaru as an admiral somehow failed to capture a single worst generation with a swarm of pasafistas a force of magnitude almost superior to a buster call. So it's could be argued as plot armour but that one mafia looking guy I can't even remember wasn't even captured. So it could be from incompetence. But then we se marine ford and he's doing things highly calculated and carefully. I'd also like to point to how basil said it was near impossible for one to escape with him going by the idea that kizaru was going all in as a lazy dude. But even low tears escaped. So the only option left is that he let them escape. Which. With him toying with the straw hats like that with observation haki practically giving rayely the chance to save zoro that could be seen as him trying to give reason to spare zoro.\n2. During the war man was just fallowing orders for the most part but even then wasn't even going for the kill. Marco was in cuffs and would be the biggest threat baring whitebeard to marine ford and ge still spared him. Even with whitebeard while it is possible that he got batted away. It's also probable that he let whitebeard save his boy since he didn't attempt to hit him post that.\n3. He is the first admiral we see actually go to a criminal situation and the second with sabaodi and egghead. Aokiji only really helped some people cross an ocean and akianu has killed more marines than some pirates soooo... by definition kizaru is actually pretty good.\n4. So because of this I theories that he will betray the marines which is more likely now than ever cause his cousin, who he cares about, was killed by cp0 a marine focused organisation. So yeah there's my theory.",

        "text": "Hello everyone, firstly shout out to u/Cectrum, as he had this discussion 2 years back but I want to add on and see where it goes. \n\nI have a crazy theory and story:\n\nSo we all know the story of both Medusa and Boa, as one was raped and punished to turn in to monstrous beast(so messed up, Athena, you are such TA), and the other was captured and subjected to all kinds of horrors as a slave and though we may not know if she was R\\*\\*\\*\\*, we do know that she was branded with the Celestial crest to prove ownershp.\n\nNow to my theory of Boa Hancock Awakening- basically there is a rumor that she just like Luffy might have a Zoan type devil fruits, hers might be the  Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Medusa or Gorgon. And some may say it is not true but Oda might be planning something and hopefully it is this. Her awakening could happen in a very unusual way, such as she gets her marking or BG exposed, let me explain, we all know that she would do anything to hide her mark from anyone and everyone at all cost. So just like Medusa's rape, it is shameful and painful to remember and if she were to be exposed or even see her tormentors, it could activate her powers further.\n\nNow devil fruits abilities are honed when the user has grown physically and mentally to support the fruits powers and have a better knowledge of it. So her trigger if she has not yet awakened it, would be exposure of her markings or to meet her abusers. \n\nAnd in this case, she transforms in to monstrous gorgon form that has snake hair, white scales  and a snake body. Now here will be her powers:\n\n* she can turn anyone in to stone just from looking in to her eyes or her blasting red rays at any targets.\n* her snake hair has poisonous venom that when bites you, can kill you instantly, and regenerate when damage\n* she has claws that when made contact towards a victim, can cause a certain part of you to turn to stone but that area also breaks apart, losing its chance to be reversed.\n* Her skin is as tough as steel and highly durable even without haki\n* the only thing is that I thought that in Boa's human state, its like when Medusa was human, beautiful, irresistible and without flaws and could use the powers at base but when in the Medusa/Gorgon form, she doesn't have that beauty anymore but a bigger, stronger, more dangerous and sadly to say heinous appearance.\n* the only draw back is that as Medusa's form was a curse, this is something like that as it needs to be activated by the deep pains, fears, hatred and shame of what she's been through to open it.....so yeah that will not be great to always do. The only way to turn back is to remember a love that was so pure to you as the user to dispel the past terror or see that person(Luffy as a whole).\n\nI hope you all like it and I would like your input on my ideas and see if I may have missed something.\n\nOh yeah, here is further reason why I believe it is a Zoan type:\n\n* Its odd that her sister had both Zoan fruits and hers was a paramecia\n* the kuja sisters seem to represent the three gorgon sisters\n* Boa has a similar part as medusa\n* Has a similar BG as Medusa",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/11o1uve/marineford_20_theory/",
        "text": "Ok the title explains my thesis, Egghead is Marineford 2.0, with the caveot that it may just be the kickoff and first part of it. Let me borrow a couple minutes of your time to show you the points that make this clear.\n\nFor one, we have the reintroduction of the Warlords, through the Seraphim. The last time the Warlords were relevant to the story was during Marineford. But, this time the Warlords have been blended with the Pacifista. \n\nSecondly, let's take a look at our cast of characters for this arc, except for Lucci Kaku and Stussy these characters were all relevant during Marineford (even if they were enthralled in personal training arcs that would pay off big in the end) but to this point, we've had multiple crew members one shot and taken out already. These characters growth isn't dependent on what happens on Egghead, they both are dependent on the aftermath and next destination (having a Vega Punk on board for Franky and going to Elbaph for Usopp). \n\nWe've just experiences (potentially) our first death of the arc, and if my theory proves true then the death of the character we were supposed to protect.... Reminds you of Ace... But I do have a theory that Shaka was the Stella body the whole time. I do add potentially because if I'm wrong and Shaka is a satellite then that could have been oil or hydraulic fluid we saw at the end, meaning Shaka could be rebuilt.\n\nBut let's get to the heavy detail, for those who are still here. What are the points that show this could escalate to an all out war in an instant. Which also oddly doubles as proof of Luffy's influence in the world. \n\nBoa stated in her last appearance that she wanted to find Luffy, and Big News Morgans just released a paper that would give indication of Luffy's location. But, as it was pointed out in a video, sand could also be seen in the wind when she was saying this... Crocodile was talking about wanting to recruit more people into Cross Guild. It's not unreasonable to think that Crocodile could use his knowledge and leverage to convince Boa to travel with him to Egghead, which would mean Cross Guild would have a presence in this fight (also bringing Buggy and Mihawk back into the story with him suddenly our cast is resembling Marineford a bit).\n\nSecondly, Kuma just made a move from Kamabaca, Dragon and the Revolutionaries are no doubt going to take this as a sign to mobilize and go get him back. But they have absolutely no reason to believe that Kuma went to attack the redline. But Dragon would have EVERY reason to believe Kuma is trying to get back to Egghead because of the Luffy article by Morgans.\n\nBut wait, there's more. We just got confirmation that the Marines have mobilized over a hundred war ships to deploy to Egghead for an unknown mission. Among those are Kizaru and a Gorosei member. But we can't forget that last time we saw Sakazuki he was talking about wanting to be mobile and more active himself.i doubt the Gorosei would let him leave, but that doesn't mean he won't make the decision to leave anyway. I highly doubt that though.\n\nFinally, there's one more tiny detail that was easily missable that introduces a new party to to this cabash. The cover story has suddenly jumped out of it's flashback, but this cover story is a flashback in itself. Caesar and Judge would have been having there fight and realization around the time of Act 1 of Wano, so they very much could already be on the move to Egghead.\n\nSo what does that leave us with? 100 Marine warships, Germa 66+Caesar, The Revolutionary Army (at least a portion), a Gorosei, an Admiral, potentially the Fleet Admiral, the Seraphim, the Vega Punk's and The Strawhats...... Suddenly Egghead is full and surrounded by power houses who all want to make there move right now. \n\nAs a thank you to those who stuck it out I will end with this, while I tried to support the theory with only facts from the pages of the story, there is a bit of head canon in there with assumptions on how some of the parties would move. I'm very likely wrong, but this was a theory I've spent quite a while thinking about that I felt was supported by good facts that give it credibility. Feel free to tell me how you see this falling apart in the comments. And finally, don't forget that the Grand Fleet isn't going to read the lies in the paper and not make a move to at least investigate.",

We have two ways of knowing that this is almost certainly not Imu.\n\nOne, Cipher Pol agents have been disappearing for the last two months.  What was happening two months ago in One Piece?  The Reverie, and the exact panel that people are using to say Imu is on Egghead.  We know its been over two months because we had a Full Moon in Whole Cake Island (Carrot Sulong) and a Full Moon during the Raid on Onigashima (Inuarashi and Nekomamushi Sulong).\n\nBut the other reason we can prove it... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[You've literally seen where Imu is already in this arc.](https://preview.redd.it/hmow9yz8tyma1.png?width=784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3bec6affb625c720812e4c3227b92d36067e5386)\n\nImu doesn't care about Egghead, they just got a killstreak and they're trying to nuke Sabo off the face of the planet.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qhqp35nruyma1.png?width=1568&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2c32c2ec51b35ae4c2fb5050a8cc72b3178049e1\n\nAnd this was only a few days ago, not two months ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ws8nvaggtyma1.png?width=784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=664ba8c9b2f5f2906c2e719c90c1975722e329ae\n\nIn the most polite way possible, I implore you to at least briefly reconsider your Imu allegations.",

        "text": "Now If we play the process of elimination, we can narrow down to the top 2 of who the traitor could be. \n\n1. It‚Äôs not any of the vegapunks\n\nHere‚Äôs why: the vegapunks all share the same conscious thanks to punk records. Meaning any of the punks who absorb or gather new data will be updated/uploaded through the shared conscious. Meaning a vegapunk who does inspire to have some ulterior motive would alert the other punks as well. Unless their all on it, none of them are on this traitorous plan. \n\n\n2. Caribou \n\nCaribou is highly likely due to the fact he was on board with luffys crew and we know he is somewhere on the island. We even see a panel of some odd entity that looked liquid in nature with glowing eyes. With caribous ability he can absorb the snail cameras with his swamp and have them disconnected, BUT there is a hole within that theory. Because we know that the past two months WG have gone missing without any of the punks awareness, and also it would be impossible for caribou to issue any commands to the serepham. So if not caribou then who? \n\n\n3. Stussy \n\nNow Stussy being some triple agent doesn‚Äôt sit right with me. Plus she cannot issue the commands as she doesn‚Äôt have the highest authority, and also the same hole as the caribou theory. \n\n\nNow we must grasp the exact reason this ‚Äútraitor‚Äù has for carrying out the plot. And I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs to kill the punks, as the disappearing of the WG agents two months ago would make you think they‚Äôd have done it by now. I think the main reason is the punk records. Be it to access the info or utilize it idk. The WG would more than likely want it destroyed, because luccis first command was to destroy the lab. And how sinister the WG is I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd want to kill their own agents. Would just make no sense. \n\nSo we run into 2 main Targets \n\n1. A brand new or non introduced character\n\nThis could explain that maybe their was someone on the island who got access to the authority chip, and somehow remodeled it. But that‚Äôs a fat MAYBE, so I kinda doubt it. \n\n\n2. Black beard Crew\n\nThis could be highly possible. You have the hypnotist/magician, invisible assassin, the doppelg√§nger, and the swamp man. This group alone has the highest chances to infiltrate egghead island with success. So could have one or two infiltrated the island prior and have been preparing. Black beard stealing Koby was maybe a way to split the WG forces as they may have split their fleet. Blackbeard is cunning, and hes the type to make a move when you least expect it. The hypnotist Laffite can hypothetically hypnotize one of the punks. But also MOTIVE: Black beard has the highest motive as I believe he needs to access to PR either to steal information on a devil fruit or steal a fruit already made. His motives on fighting boa Hancock was for her fruit. Now if teach gains info to make his own devil fruit he wouldn‚Äôt need to go chasing. \n\n\nBut you guys add on, I‚Äôve probably missed some stuff. So let‚Äôs brain storm",

Those four were the original warlords Luffy and the crew never actually defeated in combat (unlike Moria, Doffy and Crocodile). They were never *enemies* against the whole crew.\n\nBy having Vegapunk create the seraphim as a way to keep the 3 powers balanced in-universe, Oda is giving himself a chance to show how the Warlords would be fighting against the Straw Hats as true enemies.\n\nBut why wouldn't there be anymore seraphim? I don't know. Maybe Vegapunk couldn't get Crocodile, Moria or Doffy's lineage factor to work. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if the World Government refused to let Vegapunk have any of Doffy's lineage factor. Doffy does have a strange amount of pull with the government even if his family has fallen from grace in their eyes.\n\nWhen it comes to the newer warlords, I think it's possible Vegapunk never got lineage factor from Blackbeard and just didn't have time to start seraphim for Law, Buggy, or Weevil. We don't know how long Vegapunk's been working on the seraphim, and some of the satellites seemed to be a little concerned about testing the current ones battle prowess since they're considered to be kids. If there are anymore seraphim, they might be babies and unable to fight.\n\nI don't know. It just seems odd to me that the seraphim we have are the ones we've never actually fought as an enemy before.",

Someone may have already made a post about it I am not sure if someone did, tell me and I‚Äôll delete this. Anyways \n\nIm is the ‚Äútraitor‚Äù but in reality just the one sabotaging. \n\nMy evidence \n‚Ä¢ VP says to shaka ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs that you brought with you?‚Äù -pulled as a direct quote from the manga- this implies 2 things. There is obviously enough light for VP to see shaka so that means there is enough light for him to see this mystery person because the mystery person shot shaka close up, or that‚Äôs how it seems from the manga. This also implies that none of the Vegapunks have seen this mystery person because (I didn‚Äôt go back and look for the exact explanation of how the uploading data works so this could be wrong) if there is 8 different beings all seeing different people and then these people‚Äôs faces get saved and uploaded into one conscious almost all the possible people are made null and void. VP would‚Äôve seen and noticed who it was if it was any of the following, a seraphim, a marine admiral, stussy, and any other vegapunk. So to me that makes all those people impossible candidates. \n\n‚Ä¢ The mystery person runs away and makes a ‚ÄúKtok‚Äù noise, the same noise that Im makes in multiple chapters when walking. Look up ‚ÄúIm walking one piece‚Äù on google and you‚Äôll see 2 examples of it. Now there could be other characters who make this sound, maybe it‚Äôs just the metal stairs noise? However Oda is very purposeful in a lot of the things he does. \n\nLet me know what you all think, this theory is not just mine and there is a lot of people who also have been saying this.",

At the time, they brought a map of the region to the Queen and warned that this would not be possible because Bolivia is far from the coast. With nothing to do, in a symbolic gesture, the Queen made an \"x\" on the map (in Bolivia) and said: \"Bolivia no longer exists\".  \n(I don't speak English very well, so sorry for possible mistakes, I ended up using Translator.)",

This is where my interpretation might differ from people, but I believe most of Chopper's forms to be based on Human Tribes in the One Piece world.\n\nExceptions:\n\n* Brain Point: This is believed to be his hybrid reindeer-human form.\n* Walk point: Just a reindeer. His base form.\n* Horn Point: A point could be made about it being related to Oni (Kaido's race; horned humans) but a bit of stretch. I think this is just an alternate reindeer from focused on horns.\n* Guard point: Also an alt reindeer form, but focused on fur this time.\n\nExamples:\n\n* Heavy Point: Since the beginning, this has been his most human like form. To me this is what Chopper's \"base\" human form looks like.\n\n[Using Sengoku as peak human form... Which is facts](https://preview.redd.it/81o48vgwhxma1.png?width=477&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=89f608e491d5165e8e00c23958d3896691fb2dd1)\n\n[Just a big dude](https://preview.redd.it/vgv6nkuyhxma1.png?width=150&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1d54b8e7117cc7eaedb64ede2813e2d9df8c9df1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Jump Point: Chopper powers up his legs to give himself greater jumping strength. As a power solely based on his legs, it makes me think of the long-leg tribe.\n\n[Long-leg member Blue Gilly](https://preview.redd.it/y1smqcg2ixma1.png?width=176&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c0097d787d6d0ea739a789cb21bd67a0ac48b173)\n\n[Slim body, long strong legs](https://preview.redd.it/y5z8rew4ixma1.png?width=291&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e953e87664d87cf064b902272aed5f3bff97a966)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Arm Point: The opposite of jump point, a transformation completely based on his arms. This is why I associate it with the long-arm tribe.\n\n[The only example of a longarm using his long arms for strength](https://preview.redd.it/xe3t5il8ixma1.png?width=201&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d5a8616b759b44fefdb655b15f4766d4065cd3d1)\n\n[Don't have as much of a resemblance, but the concept still holds true](https://preview.redd.it/4i3oeoheixma1.png?width=210&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=95bbb753acbc3c200f22a4a983e8a2e9e41c237b)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Kung-Fu point: Learned the ability while in the Torino Kingdom, and has a striking resemblance to the inhabitants of that place.\n\n[Torino people](https://preview.redd.it/4ngk8e7iixma1.png?width=210&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=837b295c3b83445aa98ec4e6de752c58c2697639)\n\n[Round body, small eyes, wide mouth](https://preview.redd.it/nf02gfjkixma1.png?width=210&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=acc2ba7d6f29a77dc71aeec60625dc3f2cce6d29)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Babyjiji: Even this side effect form has a base in a human tribe. His small size (small as a handful) makes me think of the Tontatta/dwarves who also fit in the plam of a hand\n\n[Leo fits in Sai's hand](https://preview.redd.it/1mt7pewnixma1.png?width=200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4076951e543b50cb11c9bb487b9863d263df2f6c)\n\n[Fits in Tristan's hands \\(Sai is 7'11'' while Tristan is like Luffy size\\)](https://preview.redd.it/hogkj9opixma1.png?width=180&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fe53af28b88f28e887f70da0ae5e678cf94b6e4c)\n\nThese human tribe parallels are the basis of his power, the Human-Human fruit. Compared to Zoans we've seen, Chopper's fruit doesn't have a \"model\". As such, I don't believe the different human tribes of the world would be split between different devil fruit models.\n\n# Chopper's Strength\n\nThe only transformation I've yet to talk about is Chopper's Monster Point. If we follow the logic of every other transformation, it's pretty obvious that Monster Point is supposed to parallel the Giant tribe.\n\n[Chopper Dwarfing over Kuma who is 7m tall](https://preview.redd.it/5iwkngxtjxma1.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c078b4be7069613d4638c7bd5936bfb9c655da96)\n\nThis is important because for the longest time we believed Chopper's strongest transformation to be based on the world's strongest tribe/people, the Giants. By exerting his body and consuming three rumble balls (pre-time skip) he could tap into the strength of what was believed to be the strongest type of human on earth.\n\n# Chopper's Future\n\nWhen trying to determine how Chopper could possibly become stronger, two things come to mind. Devil Fruit awakening and a stronger human tribe.\n\nWe used to believe the strongest human tribe was the Giants, but recently we've been introduced to a new race. Believed to be Gods and portrayed to possibly be even stronger than the Giants, the Lunarians.\n\n[Added a picture of him because he looks cool, no other reason üêê](https://preview.redd.it/npbz0itphxma1.png?width=566&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=749ec97238fc411b99bef035fd99bfd3d8c2566d)\n\nAccording to Whitebeard's words, they used to be seen as Gods and resided on top of the Red-Line. No other human tribe has quite that prestige, indicating that the Lunarians are indeed special.\n\n# Awakening and Godhood\n\nNow I believe that Chopper reaching awakening and him transforming into a Lunarian (Angel Point maybe ü§∑) might end up being one and the same. A very clear similarity has been drawn between most of the Zoan DF awakenings we've seen and Deities/Gods. Even if we ignore the Mythical Zoans which are based on God-like entities, the fire/smoke sash used to identify awakened Zoans is a symbol of Godhood.\n\nSeeing as the Lunarians have been touted as a race of Gods, it seems to me like it would line up very nicely for Chopper's final point and awakening to be a Lunarian transformation. \n\nAnyways, that's my theory on how Chopper will get stronger/what his awakening will entail. If you've got any other ideas, feel free to share!\n\nTl;dr : All of Chopper's transformations are human tribes, and his last one (awakening) will be based on Lunarians.",
