        "text": "** Pink Floyd co-founder Roger Waters takes legal action over cancelling of concerts he calls a 'blatant attempt to silence me' amid antisemitism claims **\n\nRoger Waters defends freedom of speech and takes legal action against proposed concert cancellations in Frankfurt and Munich\n\nIn February 2023, the Hessian State Government and then the Magistrate of the City of Frankfurt announced their extraordinary and prejudicial intention to cancel a concert scheduled to be performed by Roger Waters at the Festhalle in Frankfurt on 28 May. On 28 February 2023, a motion was introduced in the Munich City Council to cancel the concert scheduled for 21 May 2023, in the Munich Olympiahalle. These actions are unconstitutional, without justification, and based upon the false accusation that Roger Waters is antisemitic, which he is not.\n\nAs a result of this unilateral, politically motivated action, Mr Waters has instructed his lawyers to immediately take all necessary steps to overturn this unjustifiable decision to ensure that his fundamental human right of freedom of speech is protected and that all of those who wish to see him perform, are free to do so in Frankfurt, Munich and in any other city in any other country.\n\nMr Waters believes that if this blatant attempt to silence him is left unchallenged it could have serious, far-reaching consequences for artists and activists all over the world.\n\nOfficial Source:\n\n[https://pressat.co.uk/releases/roger-waters-fights-back-3b112a553f828ca0d5eef87fd7a83df1/](https://pressat.co.uk/releases/roger-waters-fights-back-3b112a553f828ca0d5eef87fd7a83df1/)",

His most known contribution to music was as the credited writer of the piano outro on Layla that has been featured in many movies including Goodfellas though he has been accused of stealing it from his then girlfriend, Rita Coolidge.\n\nIn later life he developed mental problems and in 1983 he killed his Mother with a hammer'  He was later diagnosed with schizophrenia and he had been institutionalized since that time. Quite a complicated and tumultuous life he lived.\n\n [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim\\_Gordon\\_(musician)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Gordon_(musician))",

        "text": "Okay this is pretty sick...Pop Evil dropped their entire album 5 days early in a Deluxe Digital Album format on this new platform called Vault. On the standard tier you get early access to the album in the Vault app on iOS and Android, digital setlist, digital signed lyric sheet, behind the scenes of the making of the Paranoid music video and an exclusive merch discount code...On the higher tier you get physical items like autographed tour poster, Skeletons Vinyl, and a personalized video from the band.\n\nThe \"superfan\" tier has already been purchased but is just insane. A private acoustic performance, a signed acoustic guitar, signed drumhead, and much much more.\n\nThis is a really cool offering and I imagine a new emerging format for fans to gain deeper access to artists. Check it out!\n\n[https://dmc.vault.fan/skeletons](https://dmc.vault.fan/skeletons)",
