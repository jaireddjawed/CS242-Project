I would prefer due to possible backlash or controversy, put simply for the sake of science please no comments from anyone employed by Nasa or DOD contractors, basically I would rather not get anyone in trouble so you shouldn't bother yourself with this. To the Academics here. Q: How in the world did the Apollo Astronauts in an unshielded  spacecrafts and suits get past the Van Allen belt? I understand the radiation in and outside of the belt can get quite nasty. Particularly when that radiation bounced off the metal inside the spacecraft, it turns immediately into x-rays strong enough to cook you in seconds. Is my understanding of how intense said radiation truly is, off the mark? Second question is, was there some super secret electromagnetic field they were using or a simple Faraday cage? Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I'm eagerly awaiting any sort of response. Throwaways more than welcome if you would like to further shield your identity.

        "text": "as far as i know, astrophysicists are still confounded by the observed accelerating expansion of the universe. since we understand that bodies of mass exude a gravitational pull which strengthens with proximity and size, it makes sense that as bodies of mass spread further away from each other, their gravitational pull would become increasingly weaker which would then accelerate that dispersion. but that seems like too obvious an answer, so surely physicists must have denounced that theory already. does anybody know why that would not be the reason for the universe's increasing expansion rate?\n\ni've also considered that gravity might not be a pulling force; rather, it causes ripples in space-time which influences the paths of objects around it. if that is the case, though, could we picture space as a table cloth with grid lines, all scrunched up with wrinkles and ripples? as the sources of those wrinkles separate, the table cloth would smooth. to an observer above, looking onto the 2 dimensional table cloth, it would appear that the grid lines stretch and separate further apart. so if an object is traveling at a constant rate from grid line A to grid line B, it would appear to the observer that the object is speeding up, when really it is the grid which is smoothing causing the appearance of an increased distance from A to B. the conclusion being that it's possible the expansion of the universe is not accelerating but constant. \n\nis there a simple and widely renown disproof of this theory in modern astrophysics?",

Where can I go to learn some basics on what kind of content is taught in undergraduate astrophysics classes? Not sure if this is the right place to ask this. Also have been told to go to a university textbook store and look at some books there.\n\nEDIT: So I've been reading similar posts to mine and thought I should give you some info on my current education and (skill level?). Anyway, I am going into grade 11 in highschool and have already taken grade 11 physics and functions and have done quite well in them (91 and 94, respectively). I haven't really learnt or read much outside of school and do not understand some posts on here, but I have known astronomy (basics fact books) for a number of years. Not sure how to describe the level I am at this point but you catch my drift. I have also read quite a bit about particle and quantum physic, but not too sure on the relevance in astrophysics. I look forward to any help!",

I suspect that this is very far from reality; considering an asteroid belt like the one in our earth system, if you were to insert a spacecraft in similar orbit and velocity, that spacecraft would be able to safely navigate the inside of a belt with relatively little danger even if that belt had thousands times more asteroid density than our own belt. In relation to the spacecraft, the behavior of asteroids would be very predictable, not chaotic at all. I assume that the asteroids within a belt are all moving roughly the same direction/orbit and at roughly the same velocity.\n\nI would be very interested to know if these assumptions are correct.",

I had pretty much forgotten about it until that thread popped up a while back about how they found 26 large black holes near the center of a galaxy, and since that pretty much exactly coincides with what I thought I decided I should pop over here to see if I what I drew is similar to what we think happened.\n\nsorry for shitty ipod touch picture quality, hopefully the descriptions describe it enough. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/gaTSA",

        "text": "Hi, I'm an undergrad physics/compsci dual major, aiming to go to grad school for astrophysics, and currently working on a research project. Last year I started doing a research project involving cepheid variable stars, hosted [here](https://github.com/Rosnec/first-overtone-cepheid-pl-template) on github. For those of you who aren't familiar with cepheids, they're a type of star which is extremely useful in measuring interstellar distances ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Cepheid_variable#Period-luminosity_relation)), and I suggest reading up a bit on them. If you're never done research involving cepheid variable stars and their light curves, then you're probably not going to know a lot of what I'm talking about, but hey, that's astro research for ya. If you want to get into astro research then get used to not understanding 90% of what you're reading.\n\nI reached my initial research goals this winter, and didn't go any further with it while I was busy with classes. Now that I'm on summer break and have time to continue my research, I decided instead of continuing to work with code so monolithic and hard to use by anyone but myself, I would redesign everything I did from scratch, using a library of tools designed for anybody studying variable stars to use. I also decided to switch from using Common Lisp to clojure (another Lisp dialect), as it's more versatile and modern.\n\nThis library of tools is called Stellc (Stel as in stellar, and lc as in lightcurve), though that may change (any other name ideas?), and it is hosted on [github](https://github.com/Rosnec/stellc/) and [clojars](https://clojars.org/stellc). Currently it's in a very alpha stage, missing many of the most useful features, but is improving fast. It's written entirely in [clojure](clojure.org), and distributed under the GNU General Public License.\n\nI've only had my own limited experience in studying cepheids, and know almost nothing about any other types of variable stars, so I'd like to hear what kinds of tools others who make use of variable star lightcurves need. So far I plan to make tools to read data from text files into custom datatypes, perform [fourier analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_analysis), output graphs of lightcurves, and output data in text files for external programs to use. After I'm satisfied with this as a library, I'll be making a command line interface to extend its use beyond clojure programmers, but that won't happen anytime soon. The fact that it's in clojure, however, means it should be of some use to Java programmers as well, as clojure runs on the JVM and has interoperability with Java.\n\nI'd really love for this to become a tool for professional astronomers to use, although that seems unlikely, especially since Lisp isn't used too extensively in the scientific community. Let me know what you think.\n\n**tl;dr I'm making a program to analyze data from variable stars, and need tips from other astronomy folks on how to do it better and make it useful for their own projects**",

The Moon gains slight momentum from the tides because the Earth rotates much faster on it's own axis than the Moon does around the Earth.\n\nThere would be a point in time when the Moon reaches an equilibrium orbit and is no longer increasing it's distance from the Earth, but that timescale is on the order of billions of years and will never happen in reality.\n\nI also have recently read that most of Earth's water was present upon it's formation and gained very little over time.\n\nMy question is this:  How is it possible that the Moon formed in such a low orbit to begin with?  Is it because the accretion disc that the Moon formed from was more uniform and wasn't massive enough to pull the tides of the Earth to begin with?  Or that the formation of the Moon took such a long time to gain it's final mass that it wasn't pulling the tides?  Or do you think that the density of the Earth was more uniform and that the oceans took much longer to separate from the other molten compounds of the Earth not yet giving the Moon it's extra constant tidal push?  \n\nWhat do you guys think?\n",

Also, I don't know anything about quality, that is, what differentiates a good astrolabe from a cheap one. \n\nTo help narrow it down I've got an upper price limit of about $100.
