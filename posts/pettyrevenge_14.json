        "text": "This is an old story, but something recently happened that brought it back up. I'll tell you about that at the end of the story, I'm sure you'll get a chuckle out of it. \n\nI'll be listing the main characters with the age they were at the time. There's Me(FTM19), Brit(F24), Ash(NB25) and Duncan(M20). Duncan doesn't come in until later, but I moved in with Brit and Ash in a roommates situation around June of 2021. We were good friends and I needed to get myself and my baby (F1) out of a bad situation. The split for rent and utilities was cheap enough, we all agreed to pitch in for food and drinks, we all had our own jobs to do on certain days. We basically treated it like our own little family. \n\nBrit had given me a bad feeling when I first met her. She was clingy, easy to anger and threatened violence when she was upset. But I knew she had BPD and didn't see signs that she'd actually hurt someone. When I moved in, I learned I was wrong. Brit and Ash would bicker in almost every conversation, had screaming matches at least twice a week. Brit got physically violent and I always ended up comforting and cleaning up Ash in the end. It was stressful on me and the baby, I barely slept and it messed with my milk production. Overall just not a good situation to start with. \n\nI was using foodstamps when I moved in. I only got enough to use for one adult and one infant/toddler. At first I'd buy a good bit of food, whatever the baby needed and then some snacks for everyone. While we all bought food separately we were all aloud to use it. I was the one who cooked, we always ate dinner together. Brit would clean. Ash would leave for work. Eventually Brit stopped cleaning so it fell on me. She was just 'too overwhelmed' to do the dishes. Then they started asking for my foodstamps card for gas station runs, then flat out took it from my wallet without asking. Sometimes they'd hoard whateer they bought with it in their bedroom. All the while, Brit got more aggressive with me, refused to let me join in conversations in the living room and started saddling me with even more of the housework. \n\nBrit started to mess with my things shortly after Duncan moved in. He was nice, kind of reserved but I enjoyed hanging out with him. He put in the effort to include me in things. Brit didn't like that, and got passive aggressive with it. If I left a soda can on the counter while I changed the baby, she pour it out immediately. If I left my laptop open in the kitchen, she'd take it and literally throw it onto my bed. One day I came home to all of my expensive pumping equipment and lactation supplements dumped onto my floor. What did she say about that one? \"It's gross that guests have to see that stuff.\" \n\nWhen my foodstamps card declined only a week after recharge, I decided I needed to move out. I still had my old apartment and was still paying for it. It would take a week or two, but I planned to move back there. Starting packing my stuff and making sure it was ready to go. Brit was pissed at me, refused to talk to me and apparently told Ash six days in that I said they can't touch or talk to my baby. I never said that, I'm not a dick of that thickness. Ash asked me about it, I told her the truth and we decided to keep it civil and stay friends. We sat with each other sharing funny TikTok videos... until a text popped up on the screen from Brit. It said 'Thanks a lot Ash, now the bitch will try and stay.' \n\nThat was it. I was moving NOW.  I called my mother, a few friends, and decided I would take everything paid for with my money. I took both of my TV's, most of the cookware and cutlery. The coffee table and end table, the outside chairs, all of the organizers in the bathroom, not to mention the plunger. I almost cleared the fridge and cabinets of food and took it all with me. My bedroom was bare, so was the living room since I bought most of the decor. Half the blankets in the house were mine (I'm very tiny and get cold easily.) I'd already paid for the month but didn't as for the last half back, they'd probably already blew it on weed. (Nothing against it. I smoke too, they were just constantly high.) \n\nI just left. All of my stuff packed into multiple vehicles and on down the road. I didn't hear anything from them besides a string of crude texts saying they'd call CPS and lie to them if I didn't pay for another month. (They were going to get kicked out.) It never happened that I know of. \n\nWhat brought this back to my mind was a few weeks ago, when Duncan messaged me on facebook. He asked how I was doing, I asked the same. Then he told me he moved away from the roommates. He said he understood why I left now, that the fighting got worse and the house was in shambles. They never cleaned and Duncan couldn't do it all himself, and the mess kept him from moving his toddler in with him. Brit got jealous of him being friends with Ash and started lashing out. He couldn't take it anymore and dipped the same way I did. \n\nFrom what I know, Ash lost her job and Brit works at the piercing shop. They're living off of Ash's rich father. The relationship is at a breaking point. \n\nCan't say I feel sorry for them.",

He had some insecure twisted plans because he was bitter over my rejection. Great. A whole year to plot too.\n\nAnyways, he once entrusted his Facebook password to me so I accidentally had him saved has a profile I can log in on Facebook and I haven’t touched it for months until I was rushing to switch between my two accounts. I accidentally logged into his and found out that he did not change his password. \n\nSo I took it upon myself to leak his password on a random facebook group and exposed that he was indeed using his account to exchange unconsensual nudes of random girls with other nasty guys. \n\nHe thinks his account got hacked. And I take that as an absolute win.",

        "text": "One evening, I was at my local McD's, waiting in line to satisfy my cravings for some real junk food. It was a rather busy night so the queues were longer than usual.\n\nI was standing about a foot and a half behind the person in front - far enough to not invade their personal space but close enough that I was obviously in the queue. (This was before COVID when social distancing was a thing.)\n\nSome smug guy decided that the space in front of me had his name on it, so he squeezed himself into the gap, brushing up against both myself and the person in front. From his body language, I could almost hear himself think \"What a sucker! Personal space is for losers who want to wait longer for their meal!\"\n\nI have about as much respect for queue jumpers as those who fart in lifts or demand free stuff because they're social influenzas (sp?). So I started hatching my plan for petty revenge: Should I tap him on the shoulder and nicely ask him to move to the back? Berate him loudly to make everyone gawk at him? Put him in a rear naked choke and go all MMA on him?\n\nIn the end, I decided that the best revenge was... to do nothing.\n\nA few minutes later, he finally reached the front of the line and began dictating his order to the McD's crew member.\n\n\"I'm sorry sir, this is the pickup line for those who have already ordered. You can place your order in that other queue over there.\"",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/10hd7d7/bucket_woman_v_the_bins_again_and_my_partner/",
        "text": "For the uninitiated, the house next door is haunted by a living woman who is fixated on bringing the bins in by 9am because they make the street look messy. My partner, Martin, nicknamed her “The Bucket Woman” because of this bin curfew, as he said it was like living next door to Hyacinth Bucket. Our Bucket Woman has been known to blockade driveways with empty bins to drive home her point.\n\nAnother piece of relevant background: over the last couple of weeks, I’ve been having an allergic reaction to something outdoors, so I’ve been staying inside. Good news is, it’s gotten under control and I think we’ve worked out what plant it is. Bad news is (for Martin anyway) I’m permanently excused from weeding. \n\nSince I was staying indoors, I didn’t bring any of the bins in. Bucket Woman hovered around, repeatedly checking the bins and getting more frustrated. I went about my business, looking after New Human. (OK, I was sleep deprived due to noisy wild creatures and if someone even looked at me wrong, there was going to be a smoking hole in the Universe.)\n\nWhen Martin came home, he brought most of the bins in, except for the recycling bin which hadn’t been emptied. He reported it to the Council as a missed delivery, using their web form, because the Council offices were closed. Now here’s the important bit: the Council instruction is to leave the bin out until it’s collected. So that’s what we did. \n\nCue Martin’s first act of pettiness: he attached a neat sign to the bin lid, saying something like “Missed delivery, reported to Council” and the date. \n\nThat didn’t stop Bucket Woman from checking the recycling bin several times, each time getting a bit more aggressive in slamming the lid back down again and flouncing off. \n\nThis went on all weekend. Outside: periodically stalk to the bin, fling the lid open, peer inside, make dramatic gesture, slam lid shut, flounce off. Inside: Ignore, with the occasional snigger. \n\nCue Martin’s second act of pettiness. He added another sign: “Leave the bin alone Hyacinth!” (only he used her real name). \n\nThe replacement delivery happened on Monday. I was out, and when I got home I had a tired New Human and groceries to wrangle, so I left it. Martin normally deals with any bins out when he gets home, but today he wanted to come inside first and talk about our days, so he left the bin too. \n\nWe were in the front room when we heard the sound. Martin ran out the front door and down the path, with New Human and I following. The bin was lying on its side in the road, and the Bucket Woman was hopping around on one leg. \n\nIn complete silence, Martin opened the gate, glared at the Bucket Woman (his angry face is terrifying), picked up the bin and put it back. The lid was broken. Martin glared at the Bucket Woman again. Bucket Woman attempted a dignified hobble back next door. \n\nStill in silence, Martin went back inside. New Human and I followed. After a few minutes in the office, Martin came out again, holding two new signs. \n\nSign1: Broken bin reported to Council &lt;date&gt;\n\nSign 2: Don’t damage Council property, Hyacinth!\n\nWe don’t have to leave the broken bin out until it is collected, but we are anyway because we’re petty like that. (Recycling is collected fortnightly.)\n\nI have not seen this with my own eyes, but apparently Bucketty is on crutches. The story doing the rounds is she stubbed her big toe on something and broke it. I say nothing, but my smirk is worthy of ScoMo\\*.\n\n\\* For the unfamiliar, ScoMo is Scott Morrison, a former Australian Prime Minister known for his trademark smirk.",

        "text": "Obviously not me, but a great story about dealing with your neighbors chickens. Credit the Nebraska Historical Society for digging it up. Here's Charles H. Gere on how he fought fire with fire.\n\nFor some years after I was married I tried to do a little gardening both for the exercise involved and the product of the labor. I was greatly annoyed every spring by the ravages of my neighbors’ hens. I shooed them out, I remonstrated with their owners, I threw rocks, I built fences, I bought a trained dog, but all in vain. All summer I planted and hoed and watered in vain. \n\nFinally I began to dream of revenge and an inspiration came to me. That spring I planted no garden, but I went to a butcher and had him select for me three dozen of the oldest and biggest Cochin hens he got into his shop. It was a fine lot, not one in it that weighed less than ten pounds. Just at the right juncture in the spring I had them put in my barn. The quarter in which I live was more village-like than it is now and all my neighbors had more or less garden as well as chickens. They also had children who minded them off the gardens—except mine.\n\nJust when all the garden stuff was in a fair state of early growth, tender succulent and tempting to hens, when the children were all at school the men down town and the women busy, I opened my barn door and turned out my hens . . . I had inadvertently forgotten to feed or water them for three days, and within twenty minutes after they were released there wasn’t a green thing above ground within half a block of me. I collected my hens into the barn without attracting attention, and when the ravages were discovered each neighbor attributed it to the chickens of the other. Next evening there was a neighborly mass meeting, and a good deal of excitement, but a solemn agreement was made and ratified never, never, to keep any more chickens. I had the butcher come up and haul mine away after night, and to this day the people in the vicinity of J and Seventeenth [in Lincoln] don’t know to whom they owe their deliverance from the chicken scourge.",

        "text": "This is a very mild petty revenge, but still very satisfying because it was done by an entire student body.\n\nBack in the 70s, when the drinking age was 18, I went to a small college that had a lot of fraternities and sororities. Most every weekend one of them would have a beer blast, where you pay a few bucks for a cup that you can refill. Typically there would be a DJ or even a live band, although there were only three bands in town. Neighbors didn't like the noise or the rowdiness and would sometimes call the cops.\n\nThe University President was visiting one of the beer blasts with his posse of many PhD degree holders, when a Deputy Sheriff showed up because of a noise complaint. The President immediately went over to calm things down, but the Deputy was already telling the frat leaders that he was shutting things down. The President tried to reason with him, but the Deputy wasn't budging. Finally the President asked the Deputy what was the legally permissible decibel level, but he said it in a way that the deputy took as very condescending, due to the difference in education and degrees. \n\n\"I don't know nothing about no decimal system\" was his response, to which the President turned to his people and said, \"Somebody better get Dewey out here to explain it to the Deputy\". The whole group burst out laughing, and the very pissed off Deputy (who had no idea why they were laughing at him) called for backup to come and put an end to the beer blast and that was that.\n\nBut the story spread like wildfire, and from that day on, everyone called the Deputy \"Officer Dewey\". Students would wave and say, \"Good afternoon Officer Dewey\", or greet him at the local Coffee Shop the same way, including the staff behind the counter who were students. His face would turn red and you could see the rage in his eyes, but there was nothing he could do about it. \n\nThere is a happy ending: At my ten year reunion we went downtown to the same bars we frequented as students. Officer Dewey was outside one of the bars handing some sort of disturbance. It had probably been years since he had been greeted as Dewey, and a few dozen grads using that name made him laugh out loud. Time heals all wounds.",

        "text": "So I want to start off by saying that I do not hate my job. I have worked at what would be considered a chain senior home for 10+ years. I love the residents, and quite frankly they’re most of the reason I’ve stayed so long (and a few co workers of course.) The company used to be great to work for, plenty of PTO, a holiday bonus for just about every holiday, and so on. As the founder of the company started aging and heading towards retirement other investors and part owners started stepping up. That’s when we noticed small things slowly being taken away. I also want to mention we really don’t get paid correctly for the kind of work we do. First the holiday bonuses started disappearing. Then it was the yearly raises. “Improvements” like new furniture, carpet, tv’s started showing up. Painters out every couple months fixing things up. Which I think is great, the building is old and could use a facelift. However the areas where the workers are at haven’t been touched. I’m talking ancient kitchen supplies, leaky pipes and grease traps, leaking ice machines and that’s just the top of the iceberg. We’ve had such a bad staffing shortage that the people who do show up to work are honestly getting sick of working short, and not even having the materials to perform the job to the standard the company is asking for. So here’s where the big problem comes in. The corporate office sent out letters to every resident and their family members towards the end of last year stating that the staff will be getting raises, and that they needed to adjust for inflation so the rent would be going up between 100-300 a month depending on the apartment the resident has. The residents were angry (understandably) we haven’t been providing anything that would warrant such an increase. So for the last couple of months I’ve been waiting for the raise, and it finally just came through this check. 31 MEASLY CENTS AN HOUR. After working faithfully for this company for 10+ years I am making UNDER 13 DOLLARS AN HOUR. On Tuesday I will be putting in my letter of resignation, explaining why I will not be sticking around. Now here’s where the petty part comes in and I feel like I could do better, but unfortunately I’ll need them as a reference considering they have been my entire work history. There are two other staff members in my department. One is on a medical leave for god knows how long and the other one is moving out of the country in a couple of weeks. This company is notoriously bad at hiring people and would rather push the work on the remaining staff for as long as possible until they absolutely HAVE to hire someone. So now they’ll have to hire a whole new crew and nobody will be around to train them properly by the time they actually get around to it. So many horrible things have gone unpunished around there, but I think it’s time the staff strikes back. Any advice on how to be a bit prettier while still being able to keep my reference is welcome.",

The company being permanently understaffed, there were usually 2 people on these type of shifts - in this case, yours truly and the person we will call Shitty McShit, who also worked mostly graveyard shifts. \n\nI can write an entire book of stories about Shitty McShit that would showcase the reasoning behind this name, but I'll save them for later. The bottom line is this dude barely ever showed up to work, and when he did show up, he would call his friends from the company phones to keep the line busy or just spend all his time eating and watching movies. Besides refusing to work, this guy was also incredibly rude and entitled (what I know is he came from money, but his parents made him work and he was not amused. He was 20 ish if I remember correctly, but threw tantrums like a 3 year old). \n\nNow, night shifts were usually quiet and both me and Shitty each minded our own business, but it wasn't the case that week. Some service was down somewhere and calls were flooding in, to the point where I barely had time to breathe between calls. \n\nAt some point,  I notice Shitty's phone has been disconnected. He's logged off, and opened HBO to watch the GoT season premiere. While hundreds of calls and emails keep coming in. I go over to him and ask him to please do his damn job, and his response is \"Jeez, chill. It won't take long, I just really wanna know what happens on this episode\". \n\nI didn't have time to yell at this idiot, and even if I had, it would've been useless. What I did instead is I went back to my work station and messaged him what happened throughout the course of the entire episode, scene by scene. On Slack and email, with our team leader cc'd in. \n\nHe slammed the keyboard and went back to taking calls.\n\nIt made me feel better...but not good enough. \n\nI knew his university schedule wouldn't allow him to watch the episodes right as they came out, so every week, I would religiously email and slack him a message containing all the spoilers, titled \"GoT summary - I hope this helps you concentrate on work!\" \n\nWas it petty and childish? Yes.\n\nWas it delicious and beautiful? Also yes. \n\nDo I regret it? No. \n\nTL;DR: Annoying coworker refused to work because he \"needed to know what happened on GoT\" and left me with a huge workload - I sent him episode spoilers every week. I loved every minute of it.",

Then I looked down and he showed me his shoe wasn’t on and pretty much said he was going to touch me with his sweaty foot. \n\nI took his shoe and threw it down the aisle of desks and then he did the same thing with my books. I did the same thing he did, pretty much it became a who would back down first.\n\nHe spit on my shirt and all the students started screaming the teacher finally saw what was going on and yelled at me “Do not hit him!” (I’m a tall dude and I am athletic) Once he said that I spit in the kids face in front of the class and he called us both outside the classroom. \n\nI knew we were most likely going to get expelled; but luckily, this teacher was a pushover.

I was always respectful especially because I loved history .\n\nI somehow one the spot convinced him to not report the incident to the dean begged him by saying “The two of us never disrespect you like the rest of the class we like you and think your a nice guy sorry this happened”. Then convinced him to write detentions for “disturbing the class by talking”. The teacher actually seemed relieved that I came up with a good lie on the spot(odd). He wrote the detentions for us and we walked back into class.\n\nWhen we got back into class he said “No one talk about what happened here”Everyone did the opposite. Somehow the CEO (charter school) heard this and two days later he and the head of history came into class to let us know our teacher was no longer working here and the head of history was our teacher for the rest of the year.\n\nFor the rest of the year she (head of history) would tell me and the creepy kid how she didn’t like us and she was working on her break. I have no idea why we didn’t get in any trouble. I felt really bad for the teacher.\n\nTDL: Kid tries touching me with his sweaty feet so I spit in his face teacher gets fired.",

        "text": "This was from when I was in college, but thought it might be funny to share.\n\nI lived in an off campus house with 9 other guys, and as you could imagine things were kind of cramped. Everyone shared rooms (3 double rooms, one triple) and we were okay with that. We only had two showers which was a bit of a pain. I was friends with all of the guys I lived with, and we didn't really have too many problems throughout the two years we spent in that house. We were pretty good at letting everyone know if we had a problem, and most of us were good with helping to solve whatever it was.\n\nSo when I shower, I use a bottle of body wash that lasts me 3-4 months. Over time, I began noticing that these bottles started lasting more like 1-2 months. Clearly someone else in the house was using it, and that was honestly fine with me. I was one of the only guys in the house who had a part-time job so I didn't really mind getting body wash a little more frequently for others to use.\n\nHowever, what really got to me was one day when I went to shower, I found that my half full bottle was spilled all over the shower. What was weird about it was that it didn't really look like an accidental spill, but the bottle was completely squished and looked like someone deliberately wanted to get it everywhere. I mean if it was an accident, whoever did it could've just let me know and I probably would have replaced it. No biggie. But when I asked my housemates why my bottle was squished, nobody wanted to fess up and tell me. I even made it easier by just asking who was using it instead of who spilled it, but still nothing. \n\nSo the revenge came in when I bought a new bottle. I wanted to find out who it was, and came up with a plan to do so while also getting a few laughs. I took my shower and decided to then mix some green food coloring into the newly purchased bottle. My quick Internet research told me that the food coloring would show on skin for a little while, but was harmless and would be gone in a few days. Then all I had to do was wait.\n\nI let one of my housemates in on what I was doing (he was clearly not the culprit), and we just sat around all day waiting for the results. And when I say this worked better than expected, boy did it work. First, we heard the water turn off followed by a reluctant groan. Then the shower turned back on. We knew what was happening and couldn't hide our excitement. After about another half an hour of probably intense scrubbing, one of our roommates walks out with the faded green all over his body, and all three of us just burst out laughing. \n\nAfter laughing for a good while, he told us that the bottle fell and he accidentally stepped on it, causing it to kind of explode all over the shower. Kind of clumsy and embarrassing, so I kind of see why he decided to keep it to himself. \n\nSo we now knew who the culprit was, got a great laugh, and the newly green roommate had to replace both the exploded bottle of body wash as well as the green one. The food coloring did eventually come off after a few days.",

        "text": "Tl;dr. New housemate sold me an old furniture for dirt cheap, and when he kicked me out and to buy it back, but I sold it to someone else.\n\n\nTo start with some context, I am a student expat in a very overpopulated country. Finding a place to live here is a nightmare, especially being a student and not speaking a local language. \n\nI was looking for a new place and got invited into a room viewing. Two bedroom apartment, small balcony, great location, acceptable price. I loved the place instantly. My housemate (he was also my landlord) was looking for a new tenant as his GF was leaving abroad to continue studying, so I would be getting her room. We had a small talk what kind of tenant I am, what do I do etc etc. I emphasized that love being clean: dont leave dishes in the sink, wash floors weekly, collect my hair from the drain and so on. He was very happy about it and as according to his words ‘he was the cleanest in his student house’. We left on a good note and after a week I received a message that I was accepted and can move in from next month.\n\nBefore leaving, his GF suggested to buy her old furniture (mattress with the bed frame, a table and a chair) for 120eu and of course I agreed as besides the table it was barely used. \n\nOnly after a month red flags started showing. Small kitchen, maybe with 0.75^2m total countertop space, was always filled with the dirty dishes. He washed them once a week at best. His long thick black hair (I had rainbow coloured hair at the time) were everywhere. My laundry, shower, floors, kitchen sink. You know those dessert dust balls? Yeah we had that made of his hair. Constant poop stains in the toilet that were never cleaned up by him. He would charge his beard trimmer in the kitchen next to the dish dryer rack and of course after trimming bathroom sink would become black. A couple times I’ve found his nails in the bathroom sink. Basically, you get the picture. \n\nI tried speaking with him and reasoning that I am not a part time maid, I dont mind cleaning, I actually love doing it to release energy, but not *after someone*. \n\nAfter 5 or so months his GF moved back as something did not worked out with her studies. And I wish I was kidding, but she was even worse. On top of being as nasty as him, she was *a women*. Used tampons left on display in the toilet room and bloody wet underwear hanged in the shower were monthly occurrence. \n\nAlso at the time I was working as well, so 8am-9pm week days plus watching recorded theory lectures (yay corona) on the weekends made me very exhausted and short-tempered.\n\nProbably such things would make any person unhappy, but a clean-freak like myself it drove me mad. I snapped, after the long talk where I really tried to be reasonable, but couldn’t stop myself from being passive aggressive, they seem to understood and left for a weekend. On Monday they came back and he kicked me out. I had 3 months to leave the apartment. It was the end of the semester, so I either could stay in a city looking for a new place and loose the summer, or go home and try doing it online. After &gt;100 emails, lots of phone calls and no response I had almost no hope left. Start of the September I met old classmates and one of the told me that his GF leaving her current place and he could give me landlady’s phone number. So that was sorted out. \n\nNow only the moving part was left. If you recall, I bought some used furniture. Table was going to the trash as it was barely standing, chair I really liked and moved to the new place, and decided to sell the bed with the frame for 120eu. Invited a couple people to see it and was always leaving the bedroom door open, so nasty housemates could hear us. The same evening I received a message ‘So if you would like, we can buy furniture back for the same price’. ‘No :)’\n\nI sold it to this very nice lady and explained her in short why I was selling the bed. Being a good sport she arrived early morning on Saturday (housemates at this point we’re basically NEETs and sleeping till noon) and brought power tools and the loudest scotch tape she could find. It woke them up and it was a pleasure seeing them grumpy and mad how I was underselling their furniture. Lady who was buying it looked up the bed frame online and new one costs ~400eu. So overall it was a great deal for everyone besides my old housemates :)",

        "text": "Hi first time posting in this sub for my first post ill make it a semi short one, for context most people in my town at the time were poor and if you weren't you were rich, my bully was chubby so in order to keep himself from being bullied he became a asshole and he became \"friends\" with a gang of fellow assholes but he was the only kid who came from a lower income household, also in 5th grade you could borrow 3 books from the library at a time but if one was missing you couldn't borrow or renew any\n\nNow on to the story one day he was insulting me calling me stuff like faggot and talking about beating me up a daily occurrence(turns out he was right about the faggot thing) so I did the only thing I could and called him a asshole, he knew I was high functioning autistic and one of my only easy triggers was messing with my possessions especially in my desk, so he started throwing trash into my desk, I got angry and threw the crap back into his own desk, he got pissed and war ensued, he eventually won by taking his water bottle and pouring the whole thing into my desk, soaking all my assignments, trinkets, and cardboard devider, our teacher was pissed and told him he was gonna clean it up (I hated this because more messing with my stuff) but it meant my bully was away from his desk, so I peaked inside and stole a book from their desk and hid it in my bag and took it home, the following Friday he wasn't allowed to borrow any books, this continued for months, since he had no books he couldn't participate in any reading parties that have snacks and games, he couldn't work on essays our teacher asked us to write about the stories we were reading and at the end of the year it resulted in his parents having to pay a $100 fine to the school and his parents grounded him for the summer",

        "text": "Year is 1988-89. I am a 7th grader (F age 11) in my Jr. High School in the US. My brother is a 9th grader, the top grade in that school (age 13-14ish). I was exceedingly tiny, 4'9\" and 90 lbs. My brother (step) was a foot taller and filling out a little. He looks like Brad Pitt but cuter now at almost 50 y.o. sweet handsome kid.   \nOne fateful day there was an announcement on the PA system that some kids in 8th grade got in a car accident. One kid died and another kid was in a coma. Terrible, terrible news.   \nMy brother, being the goofball he was, did not listen to the PA and was goofing off with friends in the back of his class, giggling and being silly.   \nA kid in his class, the biggest kid in the school, a football prodigy and big meanie heard him laughing and thought my brother was laughing at the sad news, dissing the deceased. The football dude was BFFs with the kid who died or he was a cousin or something. So he took his grief and rage out on my brother. He got a posse of bullies together and they were threatening to pummel my brother.   \nI want to pause here to say me and my brother are pretty much trauma-bonded (I went through some shit but he went through HELL as a kid) and I thought and think he is the best human on the planet. He is kind and sweet and funny and smart. I was little but mighty in my mama bear energy towards him and still am.   \nAs it happened, my brother heard about the impending beat-down and skipped school for a couple of days. I knew big football guy was behind it. Big football guy also happened to have the top locker above me, and I had a middle locker. So big football guy would \"accidentally\" drop books, lunch boxes, etc., on me to harass me as my brother was not available for an ass-beating.   \nA few days in I had had enough. Big football guy dropped his Trapper Keeper, a folder and some books right on me. I was fucking DONE.   \nI looked him in the eye as I bent down and picked up his stuff. I opened the rings on the Trapper Keeper and hucked it down the hall. I threw his books, I threw his folders. Papers flew everywhere. In the middle of the maelstrom, I was calm. I silently looked him in the eye, closed my locker and walked away. People stared. He gaped. I never had a problem with him again. Neither did my brother.",

        "text": "A Bit long story. TLDR at the end.\n\nI joined a new Job, at a new city in a country new to me. I was looking for a 2 BR apartment &amp; wanted to share one room with someone else, as it came out cheaper than renting a 1 BR alone. To my luck, I came to know about someone who worked in my company, who coincidentally was also from my city who was also looking for a roommate. I got in touch with him and we went on apartment hunting.\n\nWe found a decent one &amp; he was reluctant to sign the lease and asked if he could stay outside the lease, as he may switch jobs and move out in few months. He was also not ready to get Internet, Power, Water under his name. I was just too excited to have found an apartment, I went ahead with this arrangement. I was pretty confident I could find someone else if/when he leaves, so didn't care much.\n\nThe move-in date was 30 days away, and for the days in between, I found temporary accommodation for the both of us at a friend's apt, who had just moved out of the city 15 days back and his apt (just a 10 mins walk from the unit I had leased) had lease for another 45 days and was also empty. He had left the unit empty, as lease breakage came higher than 2 month's rent. We both decided to stay in that unit for the 30 days &amp; pay one month rent to my friend. We decided not to buy any big furniture until we move in to our apt, to make the move easier (avoid hiring movers).\n\nA couple of days after moving in to the temporary apt unit, my new roommate informed that his wife had just delivered a baby girl and he was going to travel home for a few weeks. I was happy for him &amp; wished him luck. His travel date was just a day before the move-in date to the apt we had leased. So basically, I had to move both our clothes, luggage, furniture etc. all alone. It was tiring but since both the apartments were at walkable distance, I was able to finish the move in 4-5 hours.\n\nHe came back almost a month later. Then came the first month of splitting the expenses. I sent him the Excel with the split up &amp; he refused to pay the amount I had mentioned (Half of - rent + water + power + internet) and he paid just 10% of his share, stating he was in home only for 3 days and will pay only for those many days. I was kind of OK with him paying for utilities prorated to the no. of days he stayed but I could not accept Rent that way. Either he stayed or not, his bags &amp; furniture was in home &amp; I did not sublet the unit for the days he was out (and subletting wasn't even something we discussed before). Above all, I was the one who carried his luggage &amp; furniture to the new apt. He was not considerate. I gave him one LAST CHANCE to be fair. I tried to explain the fallacies in his argument.\n\nBut, he ignored me.\n\nSo, I decided he has to learn about something called - consequences. I was having an international travel plan, kind of in the horizon for a long time and I decided this was the time to book tickets &amp; travel (for 4 weeks), plus I asked my employer to nominate me for some work related conference at Vegas (1 week) and I was also going to travel to meet my wife (who was living a 2.5 hour flight away) multiple times in the coming months (another 3+ weeks).\n\nAdding all these days, plus a couple of road trips with my friends, I must have been out of home for at least 2 months &amp; he ended up paying more than what he \"saved\" by cheating me earlier. I was so petty that once, while returning from a trip, I reached my apartment lobby by around 11.40 PM. I just waited there until midnight, so that I'll have one less day shared, and I specifically mentioned this to him, when we were splitting the bills.\n\nTLDR - Roommate didn't think he has to pay rent for days he was not home. He didn't expect that I'll do the same, but for more days.",

Have fun cleaning this!\"\n\nThen I grabbed some Aquaphor - petroleum jelly lip balm basically, really good for chapped lips - from a little tube that I keep in my car. About a tablespoon of it. Then I smeared it on the back of the note and put the note lettering side up underneath that person's windshield wiper. If they run their windshield wiper to get rid of the note they're going to make a big freaking mess on their passenger side window. \n\nThen I got in from the passenger side of my car and drove away.\n\nBest part: I have dealer plates on my car because I just bought it so even if I'm on a security camera they're not going to have my license plate.",

I really tried my best to conceal the trash so he doesn’t notice it until he gets home. His clothes already smell like stale beer 🤢",

I was not overweight or anything, just an average middle school girl that wasn’t super athletic. During our soccer unit, there were a few incidents that were pretty hurtful and made me cry on occasion. \n\nHowever, one day when we were getting changed to go out, I got fed up and asked why people were saying unkind things to me, and they said that I was annoying because I was too “nice”. (What a cop out answer!!!! They were being mean just because they wanted to, and to help their own low confidence/self worth, but whatever.)\n\nUpon hearing this, I decided to stop being “too nice” and see if that made a difference. \n\nHow the locker room worked was that all of the lockers were free and you brought/rented your own lock. The athletic girls (and some gym class girls) had a habit of leaving their locks open since they were too cool and wanted to flex how athletic they were, since they used their lockers more than the rest of us. They also took all of the normal sized lockers and a lot of my friends and I had to take these crappy small boxed things. I grew tired of this, and a lame ass excuse for bullying pushed me over the edge.\n\nI waited in the locker room bathroom until everybody left. Then, I went around and randomly switched all of the locks of the rude girls, and I locked them &gt;:) good luck getting back to class on time and not smelling bad! And I’m not even gonna worry about you getting your gear/to after school practice on time. \n\nI was never confronted about it, and people shut up for the rest of gym class that year.",

        "text": "TL:DR at the bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack in the days of hormone-fueled adolescent awkwardness, I was that nerdy teen that sat in the back and tried to be invisible. Turns out, I was suffering from adolescent depression (which has since upgraded to clinical, but I'm thankfully stable now. Long story there.) and my mood swings, overreactions, and insomnia made life pretty difficult, despite being smart enough to pull off an A average.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnter Metro. One of a long line of bullies I had been dealing with since preschool (aren't private schools fun!?) and this dude was awful enough that I was finally pushed into therapy. Not by choice, mind you. My school counselors literally feared for my life and (almost literally) dragged me there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the interest of keeping this short, the therapist talked me through what Metro was doing to me, why it was likely happening, and how none of it was my fault. It helped, but it didn't stop the fact that it was harassment, distracting in school, and borderline physical with how Metro would threaten to shove me over or do the stupid \"But I'm not touching you!\" dance that is so popular with annoying immature kids. Here's the part that shocked me though: My therapist offered to help me plan some \"revenge\", as my teachers were clearly doing squat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will forever admire this man for stepping out for a worn out teen, but basically what we came up with is this: Ignore the idiot and let him dig his own grave, and if he needed a nudge... I could provide it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSetting: English class. Time: Early afternoon. My English teacher was already on my side because of my various outside projects (shoutout here: Still writing my novels, Mr. B!) and class participation, and the only ill mark on the class was Metro's attendance. That day was a test on Hemmingway's work, and it was nearly the end of the school day, so most kids were more eager for the bell to go off than to actually concentrate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe minute I finished my test, I checked my backpack for snacks, slipped out the sandwich I hadn't finished, and wolfed it down before anyone could see me. Then I started working on my most recent poetry project during the quiet time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnsurprisingly, Metro, who sat near me, got bored and started trying to get my attention. Usually, I would hiss at him to shut up or leave me alone, but with every ounce of will I had, I ignored him. It felt glorious. He immediately started escalating, yell-whispering and poking me with pencils to the point that the teacher actually noticed for once and told him to sit down and be quiet or there would be consequences. Metro sat still for maybe 30 seconds before he was at it again, but this time, the teacher had to step out for something, so Metro got up and started whispering vile things from right behind me to get me riled up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh man my skin was crawling with rage, but I soldiered on. Sure enough, he finally got loud enough that the other students were trying to get him to shut up, and then the teacher returned.  Metro just ducked behind me and amazingly went unnoticed, but as soon as the teacher sat down, he stood back up and started shoving my chair.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I released a plastic sandwich bag, puffed up like a balloon and sealed, onto the floor while he wasn't looking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith what I was later told was a look of absolute glee and absolutely no hesitation, Metro hopped into the air and stomped on it with all his might. Now I have a somewhat exaggerated startle reflex, so this wasn't the first time he tried to spook me, but I still can't fathom how he didn't for a second think the serendipity of a blown-up sandwich bag right behind his favorite target was staged. Even so, it was the last straw. Our English teacher, furious, slammed his fist on his desk and sent Metro to detention, and I had a whole week of blissful Metro-free days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere were some roadblocks afterwards. When Metro came back, he doubled down, but by then I had gotten my parents to get my therapist to speak to the school on my behalf (he needed their permission because I was still a minor), so Metro was transferred to a different class block. He continued to try and make my life hell, but quickly ran out of steam as it wasn't easy anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Bully doesn't question why a really well-placed sandwich bag is perfectly set up to spook his victim, and is sent to detention for a week and eventually transferred to a different class block.",

Then I pushed the inserts back into the slippers to make it look like they were never removed.\n\nI wrote nothing vulgar or sophomoric in my messages.   \n\nThen because I am so petty, I wrote some additional notes in Sharpie on the inside flaps of the box to let the employee know of my opinion of My Pillow.  My thought was that either the employee would not care (most likely), or he might pass the messages onto his supervisor.  Customer feedback is important.\n\nI shipped it and in a few days got the refund.  My wife has no idea.  When she asks, I'll tell her the truth:  I returned them because I never wanted them in the first place.  $40 is WAY too much for slippers anyway.\n\nNaturally I haven't heard anything back from My Pillow.  What I'm hoping is that someday a post will pop up somewhere online from a My Pillow customer who bought new slippers and found some not-very-nice messages left inside.",

        "text": "For a little while I had been dealing with two people emailing Gregory. I am not Gregory.\n\nAfter dealing with them, I'm just gonna say... Gregory, I'm sorry you have these people as your neighbors. I hope my petty revenge trickles down and benefits you somehow.\n\nSo. Anytime there was a noise complaint. I got an email to Gregory, of course, with words of intimidation that suggested there would be problems if something wasn't done about it (with the leasing agent CC'ed).\n\nSomeone closed their door too loudly at 10pm? Email. Someone laughed a little too loud over the weekend? Email. An excited shriek? Email with an additional statement of \"made us worry for our safety and well being\". The leasing agent was including me in their reply-alls and... somehow the original two never really noticed that I was replying with \"I am not Gregory, please stop emailing me.\" Police were called, repeatedly. Leasing agent stated there were no other noise complaints. After seeing my direct email to him about not being Gregory (BTW, I am not Gregory) the leasing agent apologized and made efforts to remove me from the TO: when replying.\n\nI replied to the original two directly, one email for each, and tried to keep it as polite as possible.\n\n&gt; You might have better luck dealing with this if you weren't emailing random people over the internet. I am not Gregory. You sent this to the wrong person. Please check the email addresses you typed in and try again. BTW. I am not Gregory.\n\nBut of course, with each successive email being a reply in the chain, thanks to the original two... I was seeing the leasing agent's responses. The last time there was a noise complaint, the leasing agent confirmed on Gregory's behalf that he was not home that weekend.\n\nI asked the original two again to stop emailing me. Because I'm not Gregory. The emails stopped coming in for a short while, so I figured that issue was resolved.\n\nNope.\n\nThey were renting Gregory's parking spot. So, of course, I got an email about that.\n\n&gt; Hi Gregory, \n\n&gt; We sold our car and we no longer need the garage rented for unit 303. Please cancel next month's charges.\n\nMy reply?\n\n&gt; This has never been Gregory's email address. STOP FUCKING EMAILING ME.\n\nTheirs? First time they directly responded to me, btw.\n\n&gt; [Name], You are a terrible person. I will make sure I'll never have to deal with this again.\n\nHuh... okay. Sounds like a threat, but okay. I'm ready to forget it at this point.\n\n4 hours later I start getting subscribe notifications.\n\nAnd new account creation emails. \n\nI had to laugh because it was so obvious. It might have been a clever form of revenge, oh, 20 years ago. \n\nSo I log into some of the accounts after resetting the passwords, check the sessions, and, of course... They're from the original two's neighborhood. Between the original two putting their full names down as signatures in emails, having relatively distinctive names, the leasing agent's office, it was pretty easy to suss out that they were in a small suburb of Vancouver. So that narrowed everything down significantly. \n\nArmed with just enough information to intimidate as to get them to back off, but not imply there is anything threatening going on, I email the original two:\n\n&gt; What you're doing is incredibly petty: Signing me up for emailing lists and trying to create accounts just because I asked you to stop emailing me several times.\n\n&gt; Problem is, all of these requests you're making are logged and when I log in on these sites, I can see the IP addresses the requests are being made from.\n\n&gt; [Small Suburb they're in], specifically.\n\n&gt; Trying to add me to emailing lists because you're trying to have your revenge at being slighted isn't going to get you anywhere. You contacted the wrong person. You won't stop involving yourself with the wrong person after being told you had the wrong person. \n\n&gt; You might think you're getting your little zaps of joy with this... but seriously ask yourself: are you willing to deal with the consequences of such?\n\n&gt; I will accept an apology and an agreement to never contact me again. \n\nI got a reply within minutes from the male of the original two.\n\n&gt; Hey, I am upset at the way you have treated my mother. You don’t deserve an apology.\n\nAnd the mother?\n\n&gt; I don't say sorry to terrible people.\n\nOh. What-fucking-ever.\n\nI continued to get more email signups and subscriptions.\n\nWhile the male was likely the one doing the 3r33t h4x0ringz, the mother was aware and condoning it. That's where I draw the line at normally not involving the parents.\n\nSo the emails continued through the night. I went to bed. Woke up to a few more. Fine. Unsubscribe. Unsubscribe. Delete. Delete. Unsubscribe. Done. The rate was so slow that it was obvious they were doing this manually. They were putting far more effort into this than I was. Almost admirable in its pettiness. \n\nThen the emails continued well into business hours.\n\nWhy this is important if the kid might be the done doing the 3r33t h4x0ringz? It was evident from her emails to Gregory (BTW, I am NOT Gregory) that she works from home. \n\nSo. It's ***ON.***\n\nOne of those sites they created an account on using my email address? LinkedIn. Big mistake. It was obvious that she used it extensively for employment. Rung up a friend of mine at Microsoft and asked him if he could forward an abuse report on my behalf.\n\nHer profile is now gone.\n\nBefore that profile disappeared, I noted her current employer and sent the CEO this email:\n\n&gt; I have repeatedly asked [Mother] to stop emailing me, she seems to think I'm a neighbor named Gregory.\n\n&gt; After making it a point to tell her to f-off because she didn't get the hint the first two times I told her I was not Gregory, she took it upon herself to tell me that \"[she] will make sure [she'll] never have to deal with this again.\"\n\n&gt; Shortly after, I started getting signed up for emailing lists online, having accounts created using my email address (all with a [geolocation for the IP address] location logged)... \n\n&gt; Problem is, these emails have continued to come in well past business hours. I suspect your employee, listed on LinkedIn as a Payroll Administrator, is using your company resources to harass me online. \n\n&gt; Please look into this issue. Attached are screenshots for reference.\n\nAbout an hour later, I get an email from the son.\n\n&gt; Fuck you.\n\nI decided to not respond. The signup and subscription emails stopped, at least.\n\nTowards the end of the business day, I got this reply.\n\n&gt; Hello Mr. [HomoplataJitz], I’ve been asked to respond to your inquiry on behalf of [CEO] following your email communication to the [Company] earlier today.\n\n&gt; I wish to report back that we have looked into this matter and can confirm that the individual in question in no longer an employee with the [Company].\n\n&gt; I also want to ensure you that all IT software and credentials for this individual are now deactivated based on our review.\n\n&gt; Should you have any further concerns please let me know as we treat these matters seriously and want to ensure that public sector resources are not being utilized inappropriately.\n\n&gt; Kind regards, [Name], Director, Human Resources\n\nI DID tell them I wasn't Gregory.",

        "text": "I posted this on another subreddit earlier, but some people informed me it is better suited here so here we go!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI used to work on cruise ships in the spa. Had been working for a couple years and was pretty good at my job so I started training to be an assistant manager so I could step up to manager (mainly for the much nicer work schedule and raise in pay cause being a normal spa member was hell on earth). I was working hard, staying way past when I should’ve gone home, some days only going to my cabin for a couple of hours just to sleep so I was hardly in my room ever.\n\nThen my roommate’s contract ended and I got a new roommate, let's call her Rita. Rita was Australian and just married, we were cruising the Mediterranean so in order for her to talk to her husband she had to call him at very odd times. I didn’t mind as she wasn’t super loud when chatting to him. The first month we shared a cabin was fine, nothing spectacular but fine. Then she woke up one morning and decided she wanted to try and make my life hell. I don’t know what I did to make her hate me, if I did I would’ve wanted to fix it as living away from your friends and family in such a stressful environment is difficult enough. Idk, maybe she got cabin fever.\n\nSo as I said before I only really went to my cabin to shower and sleep, and that meant my stuff was hardly touched. I had the bottom bunk so I kept my stuff at the foot of my bed and under a chair I was using as a bedside table. Her stuff however was all over the place. She also started being extra noisy whenever I was trying to sleep. We were set up to be on different teams so a roommate will have some privacy for a couple of hours every time you had some time off (normally in port for a morning 3 times a week). I would start work at 7am and work till about 10pm, some days till past midnight. I was tired when I was in my cabin, but then she would insist on being the most annoying person on earth. She would dry her hair at 2 am, watch a movie on loud, drink beers loudly, and be noisy on the top bunk.\n\nThen she went lower than I could ever dream, she slept with my ex bf (who I broke up with cause he cheated on me) while I was there. I was so fed up with her and complained to my manager, who said I just needed to deal with it, or date an officer with his own cabin. I was miserable.\n\nThen finally we had a cruise where head office was cruising with us to check on standards and launch a new product, I had known this lady for years and she knew me well too, we got along well. One night after dinner I get called into the office, I thought maybe I was finally getting that promotion, boy was I wrong. Head office and my manager had called me in to tell me to move out of my cabin (in which I had been for 7 months with only 2 months to go). Apparently Rita had gone and told them I was the roommate from hell, that I was being noisy on purpose and being disrespectful. She had even claimed that I stuck her toothbrush in the toilet (toothbrush was shown to me and I’d never even seen this toothbrush in my life, also it made me worry that maybe she had done this to my toothbrush). I fired back and asked my managers why they would think I would do something so disgusting after knowing me so long, and they replied they believe me but as there is no way to disprove Rita I had to be the bigger person and move out. I had an hour to pack up and transfer cabins. I was humiliated and heartbroken that someone would be so mean, but then anger kicked in.\n\nSo I packed up my stuff, but I put on my most annoying music, blocked the toilet, knowing it won’t be fixed til the next day and placed the mattress outside in the hallway so she would have to fetch it herself. Our cabin was also the only cabin with a mini fridge, and I took that thing with me, even though I didn’t use it. I left all her stuff in the fridge on the counter and set the thermostat to hot. I had some glitter from parties that I spilled on the carpet and spread all over the floor (whoops). My maintenance friends also heard of my unfair treatment and took it upon themselves to turn off the hot water in the cabin, and when it was reported they put it last on the list of things that needed to be fixed.\n\nRita complained about me stealing the fridge, but as it was never hers to begin with and it was still in a spa cabin there was nothing she could do. My new roommate was lovely, very happy to have a fridge, and never had a disagreement with me. Rita quit and went home 2 weeks later.",

        "text": "After all the tales of shit taxi drivers of late, I thought reddit might enjoy this episode. Leaving a stadium after Elton John last night (raining heavily I should add) and, you wouldn't believe it, a taxi with his light on materialises. He does the usual trick, \"where are you going?\" and mumbled something about $100. Ignored it because, as we now all know, that's dodgy bullshit. At the lights I asked why his meter wasn't going and he claimed the agreed fee was $100 to which he was told where to insert that idea. He pulls over and attempts to eject OP + girlfriend. Nope, not happening. \n\nI tell him he can either drive the job with a meter or call the cops. Unwisely he opted for the latter. In the meanwhile, the taxi was a slightly nicer place to wait (even if he did leave the windows down deliberately) for the cops - I've always wanted to see how the situation played out. Fast forward 20 minutes, they arrive and he leads with \"I told them it would be $100..\" which went down like a tonne of excrement with the constabulary. He got told to do the trip but instead asked for a ticket! Body cameras go on, turns out they do work sometimes, he gets told to do the trip, details recorded and THE most awkward trip home ensues. \n\nFor those playing at home, final fare was &lt;$30. Can't say I'd recommend this course of action unless you a) have half an hour to waste and b) have similar stubbornness. But at least we know how it plays out now!\n\nTLDR: taxi driver tries to extort triple the fare, mildly drunk buffoon refuses to pay or leave cab until trip is completed. Police called, taxi driver is told to wind his neck in.",

        "text": "(This is VERY petty, to the point it might be unsatisfying because the recipient sees no immediate consequences, but I definitely felt vindicated doing it so oh well!)\n\nA couple of weeks ago I was returning to school from winter break a few days before the semester began. The program I attend is unfortunately *very* far from my immediate family, and even a direct flight (which I thankfully had on the return trip) is around 9.5 hours. Overall it isn't the most enjoyable experience, and the best I can really do is try to bring enough to keep myself preoccupied and hope the time passes quickly. I also know that most everyone on the plane feels similarly and I try to not be a nuisance to everybody else (e.g. making incessant small talk, using entertainment devices without headphones, encroaching into other's space, etc.) Usually this mutual respect works fine, and nobody really wants to bother a surly-looking 20-something while they're reading or playing a game. \n\nAfter boarding the plane (Airbus A350, 3-3-3), I'm on the right side row in the window seat. My two seatmates are also around my age and equally uninterested in socializing. The row in front is an exit row, which is already quite spacious on a regularly sized plane with only 1 central aisle. There's easily 3-4 feet between the seats and the opposing wall, and instead of seatback entertainment centers the screens are stored in the arm rest of each seat. Said row is occupied by two young guys and a middle-aged man (who is in the seat directly ahead of me). The row ahead is definitely chattier amongst themselves but it's not obnoxious by any means and I figure it'll be your average mind-numbingly long flight.\n\nThe first strike comes around 2 or 3 hours in. The man in the seat ahead of me had a small file accordion balanced between his arm rest and the plane wall, presumably doing some work. At some point, he jostles this folder with his arm and the accordion falls backwards into my seat area and several papers are scattered. The owner of the files barely offers a glance backward before turning back to his seat. No \"oops, sorry\", no \"oh shit!\", not even a grunt. I end up picking up the papers I can easily reach and sliding them back through the gap with the organizer. Once again, no  acknowledgment of any kind. Dude just grabbed the papers without a word or nod. I'm a little miffed but whatever. There were a few papers I couldn't reach easily and I figure I'll get them during deplaning when I have space to kneel down under the seat. \n\nFast forward another 2 hours. We're about halfway through the 9.5 hour flight, I'm in the middle of (a disappointingly mediocre) Thor: Love and Thunder, and the guy decides to fully recline his seat. *Halfway through a nearly 10 hour flight*. Remember- he's sitting in an exit row with plenty of space, still has his choice of in-flight entertainment, and *still* opts to kick back at my expense. I try pushing up against the seatback with my knees up to my chest, but he isn't budging. I barely have enough room to lower my tray table to use when the drink &amp; snack cart comes by again. Between this and the files from earlier this guy is giving the impression that he has to be reminded that other people do, in fact, exist, and being inconsiderate is not gonna do him any favors. I'm trying to think of a way to get back at him short of kicking the seat, and then I remember the papers I couldn't reach earlier.\n\nBy some miracle I'm able to pretzel myself into a position where I can just barely grab the 2 pieces of paper that almost made it back to the row behind me. They're from a notepad with an organization's printed letterhead and have several names &amp; numbers scrawled on them. While I won't name the organization in question, it's affiliated with a large group known for preaching bootstrap myths and espousing prejudice behind a shield of \"personal freedoms\". I reason that surely if these (or any of the papers he'd inadvertently strewn around my seat) were of real importance to him, he would've been much more invested in their recovery. Additionally, as personal responsibility was surely a core value of his I would be remiss not to demonstrate how important it can be to keep track of your own shit rather than making it someone else's problem. So I shredded them into confetti. I took extra care to concentrate my efforts on the sections with writing and with every adjustment made thereafter to his luxury seating accommodations I tore those pieces even smaller. The sound of shredding paper failed to penetrate through his over-ear wireless Bose headphones. Of course I knew it was possible he'd already recorded these numbers on his phone but it was incredibly cathartic nonetheless and there was always a chance that he hadn't done so!\n\nBy the time our flight landed the paper shreds were scattered among the contents of several large trash bags. I did consider letting him know, but I figured it wasn't worth the risk of making a scene especially in an airport. Just thinking that he might eventually end up needing those names and numbers and being unable to find them was satisfying enough for me. That, and finally getting off the damn plane.",

        "text": "I bought my home in 2001 in a 42 home community - we bought right after 9/11, and we picked the community because the HOA fees were very low at just $51, and it wasn’t long after the we bought the last home in the community (we got a sweet deal because of this and business had really slowed right after 9/11) before those dues started going up. I was 22 at the time.\n\nLooking into the financial reports and into the meetings, it became clear why the dues were going up - the board was a little fiefdom setup by the developers of the homes.  Our management company was a subsidiary corporation of the home builder, and the board members were a combination of one of the home developers and two of the very first home purchasers in the community; a 3 person board. The first action the board took with that increase in funds was to remove trees that were not even on the HOA’s property; they were trees that sat in an area the HOA had access to for “weed abatement”.\n \nThese tree’s real crime was not that they were “weeds”, it was that they blocked the nice view of the board’s president and vice president.  At the same time, the bullshit “violation” letters started going out to about half the homes; you aren’t mowing enough. You aren’t watering enough.  Every petty thing you can think of, they were issuing warning letters and starting to fine homeowners.\n\nCue revenge time after getting one of those letters myself about “weed abatement”.  Ironically, it was researching the community’s CC&amp;Rs about weed abatement that let me to realize the trees that were cut were not on HOA property, and it was researching the annual budget that let to me finding out the huge “weed abatement” expense that was actually the community’s funds being spent to remove trees solely for the two board member homeowner’s views. I then found out that in California, all anyone needs to initiate a recall of the entire board (and install a new one, if successful) was the signatures of 5% of homeowners, delivered to the current board.  That’s a total of THREE houses in a 42 home community lol; the Board was issued a recall notice not 48 hours after I had found out about the law, delivered to the management company in person.  (Ironically, the home builder’s corporate office was in the exact same building as the management company - you’d think they would have wanted to not make their association so obvious but hey, it was 2002 lol).\n\nThis is also when I found out that the management company basically had the entire board in its pocket, because they dragged their feet with the recall vote; they set it as far out as they could by law, in the middle of the day. Instead of holding it in the community like all board meetings, they set the place at a local park a couple miles away.  They thought they were so brilliant doing this…\n\nSo, me and my wife put together a proxy voting form for the election, and we went to every door in our community.  We told them what was happening with their money, their plans to create an “architecture committee” that would require all homeowners to get approvals for any additions or changes, everything.  It took us three rounds around the neighborhood, plus a couple extra visits to homes that had not answered initially. In the end, me and my wife had TWENTY SIX revocable proxies for the election.  For those unfamiliar with proxies, it basically gave me and my wife the power to cast that homeowner’s vote for them, if and only if they didn’t show up to the election. The thoughtless board and management company actually made it easier for us to collect the proxies, because a lot of homeowners flat out could not make the time and place of the meeting.\n\nThe recall day finally arrives. The current board members are all there, the management company representative is there, and 8 other homeowners showed up to the meeting (6 of whom we had proxies for, and which were revoked by their attendance).\n\nThey opened the meeting, and started saying something about “oh, looks like a waste of money there isn’t a quorum, blah blah”.  I then said, I’m sorry, but we do have a quorum.  They’re like, “um, no, you need 22 homeowners here and there’s only 12 (the three board members, me and wifey, and the 8 others that showed up).  And that’s when I pulled out the trump card; I dropped all twenty six proxies on the bench table everyone was sitting at and said, I’m sorry but there are thirty homeowners present, and pointed out the math; after subtracting the six homeowners that had showed up, we had twenty additional votes that counted for both quorum and voting purposes.\n\nThey ALL got wide eyed, most especially the management company representative. He came over and looked at the forms very closely and compared it against a list of the homeowners.  Even the people that were there and on our side did not realize how much work we had done to ensure the bullshit ended there and now.\n\nThe recall meeting was opened, the board members voted not to recall plus their 3 friends that were on their side, the other homeowners present voted to recall and the votes stood at 6 to 6, tied.  I then stood, and declared that we were voting to recall the entire board, and that we were voting our twenty valid proxy votes to recall.\n\nRecall passed, 26 votes to 6. \nNext vote: who replaces the board members?  It ended up becoming me and wifey and another homeowner that had voted for recall and was willing to take the seat. We elected ourselves to the board seats by a vote of 26 to 6. \n\nIt was at this point that the management company then stated that Cannon Management was immediately resigning as the management company for the community.  I then pulled out the HOA’s management contract, which clearly stated that either side needed to give 3 months notice to effect resignation, and stated that we, the new board, accepted their resignation and set an end date for their services 3 months later lol.  \n\nThe management guy was *nuclear* pist off; I (a 22 year old kid at the time) had beaten them at their game AND I had prepared for their possible “quitting” shenanigan.  \n\nWe replaced the management company after a couple months, having had proper time to find and vet an independent company (at about half the cost, no less). Did the same with the gardening services, which was also a home builder affiliated company, also at about half the cost. The old President of the HOA put his home up for sale about a month later, after we rescinded all the old violations and issued a notice to the old board members that we intended to vote on whether they had committed fraud against the association over their “weed abatement” tree removal action.  \n\nI still vividly remember walking over to Dale’s house (the old President) the day he was moving and giving him a big wave goodbye as he was getting into the car to follow his moving truck. He gave me the finger as he drove out; definitely one of my proudest moments in life.",

It's worth noting he was carrying on an affair with a colleague at the time also.  My boss and I hadn't seen eye-to-eye all the time, because I advocate for front-line employees and he says this makes it so he cannot trust me.  \n\nI put in for the position because I've been training new hires for 7 years, even sent overseas to do so.  I also have a degree in education, 11 years in the industry, and created and compiled training information used system-wide.  It was just something I was passionate about.  \n\nHe gave the position to the colleague he was sleeping with, without even interviewing anyone.  I was visibly upset when they broke the news to me so he face-timed me (he had his subordinate break the news).  I asked him why he didn't have the courtesy of at least giving me 25 minutes of his time as an opportunity for my development of growth during an interview.  He said every day is an interview, and that I because I'm a caretaker for my dad (Parkinson's) I couldn't be relied on to show up for work.  Which I find offensive because I've taken off two days in 3 years for my dad, each were ER visits.  \n\nI ended the call with the subordinate present and he was like \"you good?\" And I said \"Yeah, I'm fine.  But I am going to go to HR, I am going to find a new job, and I am not going to feel sorry.  But if I come back, it'll be in his office.\"\n\nI kicked a job search into high gear and pretty quickly found a new job that paid twice as much.\n\n  I put my two weeks in, but during that time, I organized a joint 5-man HR report in regards to my boss's illicit affair. \n\n I deleted all of my intellectual property off the shared system.  Hundreds of training documents and slideshows, including a 15 day new-hire course.\n\nAnd now?  I'm making twice as much money.\n\nMy old boss was walked off company property and terminated.\n\nThe person who was supposed to be the trainer had no information and they abolished the role.  \n\nAnd...I just put my application in for his position. \n\nBummer.  If only I had 25 minutes of his time.  I know he has a lot more of it now.",

        "text": "So this isn't my story, this is my Dad's. I was a kids and this saga basically spanned the whole 90's. I grew up on a small street that back in the day was a small neighborhood of 14 houses surrounded by horse pastures. It's since been developed all around it but was pretty quiet while I was growing up. The neighborhood had a small well that serviced the houses and they had a small Well Associate (mini HOA) that took care of it. It was a great deal. $40 a month and you get as much water as you want.\n\nThe neighbor at the end of the street was a paralyzed woman in a wheel chair. Let's call her Meth Queen (MQ). Before you feel bad for her, she was paralyzed by driving drunk/high and getting in a car accident. She was also a meth dealer and frequently had criminals at her house. I'm talking hardened, violent criminals with warrants. Every few months, we would get a knock on the doors and it would be a cop, warning us to stay inside because they were raiding her house. My neighbor up the street was a small time jeweler and she had 2 cops posing as a married couple looking at jeweler but were actually collecting info from the neighbors and getting surveillance. Somehow, they never were able to nail the MQ, Just her friends.\n\nWell, even though the water was cheap, MQ decide to stop paying her bill. After 3 years of not paying, the Well Association decided to turn off her water. They sent my Dad over to do it. First, he just turned it off (there is a shut off for each house in a ground box). They turned it back on. He then turned it off with a lock. They cut the lock and turn it back on. He then cuts out 12\" of pipe, caps its, shuts of the water with a lock. They cut the lock, turn the valve, then complain to the Association that they have no water (no sh\\*t). The Association told them to pay up. They responded by breaking the back windshield of my Dad's car and later stealing it.\n\nThis is the crazy part, they lived without running water for almost 3 years! They used the outside as their toilet. I don't want to know what the inside looked like. There were never less than 3 adults living in that house at a time, including MQ so you can imagine how bad it got. MQ complained constantly saying she was getting gangrene, etc. Obviously not true but I'm sure health wasn't great.\n\nIronically, it's wasn't the cops or lack of water that go rid of her at the end of the day...it was the bank. They stopped paying their mortgage and tried to sell. My Dad made sure to tell every person who visited about it being a meth house. I don't think they cooked there, but they sure did sell. No one was buying and the bank foreclosed on the house. Left MQ with nothing. The new owners paid the lien on the water, my Dad hooked up the water again, the new owners fixed and flipped the house and the current owners have been there ever since.",

        "text": " \n\nTo say the least, names are changed for protection.\n\nWhen  I was 17, I tried asking this one girl out, let's call her Maria. Not  only did Maria reject me, but she also blocked me on Facebook. I can  handle the rejection, but the blocking was a bridge too far.  Nonetheless, I stopped the pursuit.\n\nMaria  and I went to different schools because I went to an all-boy school and  she went to an all-girl school 5 blocks west of my school. This will be  important later.\n\nDuring my senior  year of high school, I went to see a psychologist on separate issues.  With respect to my high school, the psychologist's office was 3 blocks  west then 9 blocks south.\n\nOne day,  my school's disciplinarian, let's call him Terry, calls me into his  office and says that Maria's school's disciplinarian says that I was  \"stalking her.\"\n\nI explained to him  where I was going and that was the route I had to take. He believed me,  but...he still had to punish me for God knows what reason.\n\nHe  says that until I graduated High school, for the first five blocks  south of the school, I cannot walk on any of the blocks west of the  school, and I couldn't tell a motherfucking soul about it. The following  sanctions were possible if I did that:\n\n* Not allowed to prom (wasn't going anyway)\n* Not allowed to walk at graduation\n* Expelled from school\n\nBecause this fell under the category of \"sexual harassment,\" technically he *had*  to report it to the Diocese (I went to a Catholic school). HOWEVER, he  made a deal with me. The letter that he had to submit to the diocese, he  would seal in an envelope and put in a safe in the finance office of  the school. If I held my end of the deal until graduation, he shreds  that envelope.\n\nHowever, if I  didn't hold my end, that letter goes to the diocese, I don't  graduate/get expelled, and he loses his job too for failing to report  immediately.\n\nAll this because  Maria decides to do a false accusation against me. If you didn't want to  date me, fine! I wasn't pursuing it anymore. Just because we happened  to walk past each other on the street (I didn't even SEE YOU) doesn't  mean you had to ruin my life.\n\nFuck you Maria for lying\n\nand big-time Fuck you Terry for infringing on my rights and not taking my side.\n\nTo  say the least, I held my end of the bargain, got my high school degree  (and later a Bachelor's and recently, a Master's). Once I graduated, I  told everyone (since I couldn't tell anyone in high school). \n\nAnd when I told everyone, I meant *everyone*. I worked at a law firm at the time. One partner recommended I \"let it go\" but the more senior partner was very adamant that this could hold its weight as a libel/slander suit. I chose not to file a lawsuit because I'm not stooping to her level, but...word travels fast. Apparently Maria worked at another law firm as a file clerk. The lawyer I worked for had strong connections and he told his people, one of them happened to be Maria's employer.\n\nMaria was fired from her job. When she graduated to be a paralegal, her name was drug through the mud. She now works on the other side of the state, essentially ran out of my city.",

        "author": "chilldude890",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/10fgrkx/how_i_gutted_my_hoa/",
        "text": "This is the story of how I completely changed out my community's HOA board and foreclosed on one of their houses after they disrespected me.\n\n**Backstory**\n\nA few years ago, I bought my first house in a medium-size (500-1000 homes) neighborhood in a southern state. It had an HOA, but I actually picked the neighborhood because they had the lowest HOA dues in the city, the fewest rules, and the house was by far the nicest one I could afford in my budget.\n\nAfter a few weeks, I get a violation notice from the HOA telling me that I had two violations needing correction:\n\n1. My lawn was not green enough.\n2. My trash cans were too close to my driveway.\n\nI was thoroughly confused about #1 as it was February, in the middle of winter, so of course my lawn was dead (like pretty much everyone else's), so I had assumed that either this was a mistake or an existing offense from the previous owner. As for the trash cans, I kept them on the side of my house and I think when the HOA came by, my trash cans stuck out past the side wall \\~1 foot, so HOW DARE I?! I shrugged them off and continued on.\n\nCome March, I got another notice, this time fining me for both violations. Each one cost me $100 and they wanted the money in two weeks. I. was. pissed. This has made no sense and I was not about to let them just try and get money for BS violations. So, I called the management company that worked with the board to get them appealed. The lady told me that I needed to appeal directly to the board, and that I could do so in the next annual meeting in a few days.\n\nSo, I of course showed up to the meeting. Prior to it starting, I met with a few homeowners and learned that they were all there for similar BS violations, and were pissed off too. I then talked with one of the members of the board about the fine appeals process. He was older guy in his 70's with short grey hair and a very worn and angry face. He asked what I was getting fined for, and when I told him, he just looked at me and said: \"And you should get fined for that. Young people like you not taking care of their homes is the whole reason I got on this board. Learn to be a better property owner.\" This dude was the VP of a volunteer board telling me that I did not know how to take care of my house. What a sad life.\n\nThe meeting then started and the moderator mentioned that since this was an annual meeting, we would be voting on 3/5 board members. They had some applicants to the board, and we could also nominate someone today. That's when I had the idea of how I could get my revenge. When the election part of the meeting came, I nominated myself, gave some BS speech about HOAs are not here to make money and that I wanted to serve my community. I won in a landslide, and you could see the board members getting annoyed because they had scowled during my speech.\n\nAfter the meeting, I appealed my violations (in a very elegant way) and they agreed to waive my trash can violation. As for the grass one, apparently since I had weeds growing in my yard (like tiny patch in the corner), they were still fining me because the weeds were turning yellow after I sprayed them. I was dumbfounded how they could get away with this, but they used a technicality in the bylaws that I had signed, so I ended up losing $100.\n\n**Revenge**\n\nI will be honest, I had not expected this too work. After joining the board (of 5, including myself), I was appointed secretary and had to help maintain meeting notes and review records. They specifically told me that I was not allowed to propose new policies, but I could vote on new ones proposed by the VP or President (which I later learned was actually a violation of their own rules). I voted every new rule down as long as I was in that position. I decided that my best course of action was to listen to how the others operated, and look for an opening to get each of them off the board.\n\nThe first opening came when the President (who literally looked like the most Karen woman ever) mentioned that she had wanted to fine for flowers that were not \"neutral\" color. Basically, if a homeowner wanted to add something like turquoise flowers, we would fine them. She apparently had a neighbor that had flowers that she didn't like, and she wanted to use the board to stop them. It was pretty insane. I then started my revenge on her. I started a message thread (on Slack since that's how we communicated) with the other board members and asked what they had thought about her policy and reasoning. After far too much deliberation (two of them honestly thought that this was ok), we agreed that the policy went too far. I then made a long post in the main channel telling her that her actions were not only wrong, but that she should be excused from the board. When she inevitably flipped out, I called a board meeting in the following week, and the other 4 board members voted her off for targeting a community member for personal gain. She gave a sob story about how the board was her life and that the neighborhood was like her child, but I didn't care. That was one down. I \\\\ convinced one of my good neighbor friends to join a little later on to take her spot.\n\nThe next members I targeted were the treasurer and director, as I wanted to save the VP for last. They were actually pretty easy to get off the board because they were very easily swayed by public opinion. So, I made a fake account on Nextdoor and waited until Spring (when most of the violations go out). When the letters went out, I looked for angry posts on Nextdoor. I then would comment on each one giving them the first names of the two board members as the culprits and told them to come to the next HOA meeting to appeal. It worked far better than I had expected. During the next meeting, over 50 people showed up and called out those by name. It was glorious. During the open session, community members grilled those two for their poor policies (even though they did not make most of them). The VP (now president after the other one resigned) tried to defend them, but ultimately failed. The two members were so distraught after the meeting, and I told them that maybe they should resign, and they both did. That was two more down (both of which were replaced by a couple who came to the same meeting and wanted to get rid of these rules).\n\nFinally, the board had been flipped to 4 out of 5 people wanting to get rid of all these dumb rules. The president however, was still same old angry hateful man. He tried to add more rules to increase violation revenue and we voted him down every time. He started to get annoyed, but stayed steadfast to the board. I tried a lot of tactics to get him to leave, and not much swayed him. A few months went by and we started with a new management company. They had a much better style of property management and a website for looking through our community's records as well as automated reports. When we got our first fines report, I hit pay dirt. The President's house appeared, and he owed around $10,000! Apparently he had open violations that he had never paid and the other management company hid it from the board for him (since he had been on the board for close to 7 years). So, I looked into remedies. Since his fines were over $3,000, our bylaws stated that a majority vote of the board could start an HOA foreclosure on the home (which I still think is INSANE that HOAs can do that...). So, I got all the docs together and double-checked with the new management company that the fines were correct, which they confirmed. I called an emergency board session, presented the information, and 4/5 of us voted to start the foreclosure process. The president got angry, cursed, and left the meeting early.\n\nWe were informed a few days later that the President had resigned, paid his fine, and put his house up for sale. While I am sad we couldn't force a foreclosure, at least he was off the board. I am currently president to this day, and I have reduced the fining policy to be a maximum of $400 and home owners can appeal any time that they wish digitally. In addition, I have banned any grass fines until May, and trash can violations have been super relaxed.\n\nMorale of the story: never fine me $200, call me a stupid young kid, and expect to not lose your house.",

My husband would bring his plow truck in from his parents house and plow our driveway.  The neighbor started to ask him to do the same and he did a few times.  However, after a few snow falls, my husband got a call from a city worker who he is friends with and told him that the neighbor called and complained to the city about our plow because the snow building up was making it hard for him to see to pull out of his driveway.  The next night we ended up with a good foot of snow.  We left the snow plow where it was and started hand shoveling.  When the neighbor came outside and asked if we were going to plow for him my husband kindly said \"No.  Some Ahole complained to the city about my plow so we're shoveling from now on!\" The guy averted his eyes quickly and hasn't really spoken to us since.
