Is it because we’re siloed off into our own echo chambers, and it being inconvenient to listen to the other side? Is it cable news, that has exaggerated conflict and political differences between us? Is it something else entirely? \n\nSomething seems to have changed. Politicians from differing parties used to call each other “friends” and “colleagues”, even if much of that was tongue in cheek. Now they call each other pedophiles and groomers. \n\nThere seems to be so much anger. So much division. So much hate. Bipartisanship has become considered a sign of weakness, even betrayal. \n\nWhat has changed with our politics?",
