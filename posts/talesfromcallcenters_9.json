        "text": "Hi everyone, just found this subreddit and I am enjoying the stories that I have read so far. \n\nThis story is from about 10 years ago, when I was working at 3rd party call center for a very large cell phone company. Its kind of long as I remember this call very well, TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nMe = Me\nIC = Irate Customer\nEx = IC's ex husband\n\nIt was just a normal day of answering the normal, mundane calls about activating phones, and premium text messaging charges when this gem of a call came in.\n\n&gt; Me: Thank you for calling [cell phone company] my name is Cappy6124. May I have your first and last name please?\n\n&gt; EX: [gives name]\n\n&gt; Me: Thank you Ex, may I have the phone number you are calling in about?\n\n&gt; Ex: I already gave my number to the system, how come you need it again?\n\n&gt; Me: I'm sorry sir, but we are an older call center that does not currently have the ability to get that information from the automated system.\n\nWhich was the truth. As a 3rd party supplier for the client, it wasn't deemed important that we have that ability.\n\n&gt; Ex: I'm calling in about [number].\n\n&gt; Me: Thank you sir, how can I help you today?\n\n&gt; Ex: I'm calling in about my $43,000 personal cell phone bill, I was hoping you could tell me what is going on.\n\nNow I had seen bills this large before, usually from large companies that have 3000 or more phones for their employees, but never a personal account.\n\n&gt; Me: (Trying to contain my laughter) I'd be more than happy to look into your $43,000 cell phone bill. However I see here that you are not listed on the account. Would it be OK if i contact the account owner?\n\n&gt; Ex: IC? Yeah, go ahead, she's my ex-wife.\n\nGreat. Ex-wife, this isn't going to end well.\n\n&gt; Me: Thank you. I'm going to put you on a brief hold while I contact her.\n\n&gt; Me: IC? This is cappy6124 calling from [cell phone company] I currently have Ex on the phone. He would like to find out what is going on with his phone number, is that OK?\n\n&gt; IC: Yes, please do, also please call me back when you are done speaking with him so that you can explain it to me.\n\nAgain, awesome... This is not going to be a good conversation.\n\n&gt; Me: Ok, no problem. I'll give you a call back shortly.\n\n&gt; Me: Ex? I just spoke with IC and she gave permission to speak to you. Looking over your account I see that the number you are calling about had a new phone activated about a month and a half ago. \n\n&gt; Ex: Yeah, my ex-wife activated it for me so I could talk to our kids.\n\n&gt; Me: Ok, and its a Palm?\n\n&gt; Ex: Yes.\n\n&gt; Me: Here's what happened. This phone has access to the internet, and, was being billed at $0.02/KB. Last month you used roughly 2,150,000 KB. \n\n&gt; Ex: Why wasn't this stopped? Why weren't we notified. \n\n&gt; Me: Well sir, when the phone was activated the representative notated that they offered IC a few options.\n\n&gt;    1. Unlimited data plan for $39.99/mo\n\n&gt;    2. Block all data, but it will block picture messages as well.\n\n&gt;    3. $0.02/KB\n\n&gt; However, she chose the 3rd option. Stating that she would tell you not to use the internet.\n\nThe option to block data was one that almost nobody chose because it was a hard block on all data at the switch. When pictures were sent from one person to another, it used the data connection on the phone, but the company was able to see that the data originated from a picture message and you weren't charged for the data usage. So, when you absolutely wanted to prevent data use, this was the way.\n\nWhat was surprising was how well the previous call was notated. This usually happens when someone knows shit will hit the fan the following month. CYA.\n\n&gt; EX: Is there anything you can do? \n\n&gt; Me: Well, the usage this month was flagged, and an unlimited data plan has been added to this line, which saves about $17,000 in charges already accrued this month, but, because IC declined all of the other options, there really isn't anything we can do.\n\n&gt; EX: Oh, Ok. Well thank you for answering my questions.\n\n&gt; Me: Oh, yeah, no problem. Anything else I can help you with?\n\n&gt; EX: Nope, you were great. Thanks.\n\nOk, wasn't expecting him to be so cool about it, but it was his ex-wife's account, so he probably didn't care too much.\n\n&gt; Me: IC? This is cappy6124 calling you back to go over your account.\n\n&gt; IC: Great, so what can you tell me? \n\nI explained the whole situation again.\n\n&gt; IC: This is ridiculous! Why weren't we notified?\n\n&gt; Me: We do have many options for checking the usage on you phones, including dialing #data from your phone, and using [website].com. Unfortunately we are not able to contact everyone about their usage.\n\n&gt; IC: What can we do about this, i'm not paying this bill, this should have been caught!\n\n&gt; Me: Well ma'am, it is notated on your account that we offered you a few options that you declined. However, to prevent this excess bill again this month, the unlimited data option was added to that line, and we have saved you $17,000!\n\n&gt; IC: (yelling at this point) This is completely unacceptable! I'm not going to pay this! I'm going to call my lawyer!\n\n&gt; Me: I'm sorry ma'am, since you have now indicated legal action, I will no longer be able to continue the call. I will inform you however, that in agreeing to our terms of service, you will be subject to mandatory arbitration, if you do continue with legal action. (It was my job to set expectations after all). Is there anything else I can assist you with today?\n\n\n&gt; IC: [call goes dead]\n\n\nTL;DR: Woman activates a phone for her ex-husband. Declines all options to reduce the bill due to data usage and gets a $43,000 bill. \n\nMoral: Listen to what the people on the phone are telling you. It could save you the cost of a small house, or a fancy car.\n\n\n\n\nedit: formatting\n\n\nEdit 2:\n\nI probably should have said this earlier, but I did try to do something for IC. I did speak with my manager at one point but because of the amount and the notes on the account there wasn’t much we could do. I usually tried to find a policy or something that would allow me to help. This time my hands were tied\n\nI have another story of a charge that I did have completely reversed that I will post when I have time. ",

        "text": "Hello there!  First time poster here.  I have worked in call centers off and on for about 20 years.  My experience ranges from customer service, collections, pharmacy, and more.  Today's tale will be from my time spent working for ABC security (not their real name).  \n\nIn training they liked to scare people by having them learn burglar alarms first.  They sound the scariest, but they really were the most simple alarm with the clearest options of how to handle them.  We get the notification of the alarm and have to call out on it.  Customers can have 1-2 numbers as OMG, CALL ME FIRST numbers.  That was usually their home line and work or cell.  This was useful for people with pets in areas where police fined a lot for false alarms.  We could call them and let them determine if it was safe or not and with their password we could cancel the alarm.  After those first two lines, we notified the police.  After the police the customer could have secondary lines, neighbors or family nearby who could check on the situation usually.\n\nNow, having explained that... my call!  It started off as a burglar alarm.  No answer at the home line, which was their only pre-call line.  I am noticing that this is the second alarm that has gone off, ten minutes after the first.  On the first alarm there were no answers on any line and police were notified.  The first alarm had been front door, and now it is a rear door.  This USUALLY means the police are checking doors to make sure they are secure.  \n\nCops answer and I notify them and am told, \"Yes, officers are on scene.  There is a body.\"  Wait, WHAT?!  I had no clue how to process this.  We are just security.  I've never had a body report.  How does security handle that?  What can we say to the other numbers?!  So I get off the line with them and call a lead and get advice.  They say we can't give details but to HEAVILY suggest to anyone we may reach that they go check on the situation.\n\nSo I continue down the line to finish the calls and pray no one answers so I can just leave messages and move on.  Last line... a little old lady answers.  I let her know of the alarm and she informs me she is just a church friend and that she doesn't want to intrude.  I'm thinking... 'Lady, you may not see your church friend again if you don't look into this.'  Obviously, I have no clue if it is the homeowner that is dead or an intruder or what, but... MAYDAY!  She insists it isn't her place and that she'll find out from her friend on Sunday so I have to let her go.\n\nNow, the sad fact of working in security systems is that you usually do not get a resolution.  Once the calls for the alarm are over, you are done.   You don't know what happens.  But I wrote that woman's name and city and state down and for a week I googled her once a night.  Finally I get an article.  She had a heart attack and died.  From the alarm sequences she either tried to leave and get help, or knew she had an alarm and triggered it to get help called.  Either way, help was not in time.  It was on of the few calls I got resolution on and it was a sad one.  \n\nI still have to wonder how that woman I called felt when she went to church and found out that the calls had been because her church companion had passed on.  Poor lady.",

        "text": "I work in financial aid at a University. A lot of students are snotty this time of year. One of my coping methods of dealing with so many bitchy callers is taking any opportunity I have to be passive aggressive, and running with it. I'll tell you about the call I had today.\n\nKeep in mind, the Summer semester is part of the 17/18 aid year, and a lot of students get confused cos they're not sure what aid year Summer falls under. They can also get confused because they think I mean the calendar year 2018, but I always emphasize **aid** year. Most students don't have trouble with this. But either way, I'm always happy to clarify, no big deal.\n\nI asked this girl what **aid** year she was referring to, as she had aid for both 17/18 and 18/19. I was pretty sure she was referring to 18/19, based on her question, but do always want to clarify. She replied to my question in a snotty, condescending voice, \"Uh, this year?\" Obviously, we're currently in Summer, 17/18.\n\nShe had been a student for a couple years, so she shouldn't have had any confusion about how aid years work, and wants to talk to me like an idiot. Well. I proceeded to answer her question exactly how she wanted it, for **this aid year**, repeatedly emphasizing that I'm talking about 17/18 Summer, and she goes:\n\n\"I don't care about Summer, I said this year!\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm sorry, we are currently in the Summer semester, so I thought you meant *this year*. Were you referring to aid for 18/19?\"\n\nI emphasized \"this year\" to make sure she made the connection.\n\n\"Yes, 18/19, for Fall 2018.\"\n\n\"Gotcha. So since Fall 2018 aid does not disburse until August...\" (therefore clearly not right now aid) and the rest of the call I felt so satisfied.",

        "text": "Hello, again! Tier 1 ISP tech support here with another thrilling tale. Today we will learn why the moral of the movie \"Waiting...\" applies not only to the people who make your food, but also the people who connect your internet: the field techs.\n\nIn this story, I will be \"Me\" and our wonderful caller will be \"Mr.Grr\". \n\n**Me**: Thank you for calling ISP, my name is Me, how may I assist you?\n\n**Mr.Grr**: Yeah I need to talk to someone about getting my service reconnected. \n\n**Me**: I'll be happy to look into that for you, may I have the name on your account?\n\n*Disconnects go to Billing, since I can't handle those, but I don't think that's what's happening here. Biggest flag is that his account comes up as active. So now I have to ask questions.*\n\n**Me**: Sir, your account doesn't appear to be disconnected in the system . Are you calling because you noticed your internet isn't working or because of a billing issue?\n\n**Mr.Grr**: No, there was a tech out here earlier and he disconnected me at the pole and left. I need y'all to reconnect me.\n\n *So now I'm checking the work orders on his account, and I see a cancelled order for a down drop (when a line has either drooped too low to the ground or has actually fallen on the ground, we send a tech to re-string the line and life goes on) along with another newer order that just says \"Referred to Field Tech Sup / GM\". Oh dear.* \n\n*I tell Mr.Grr I needed to check with one of my leads before sending another tech out there. I put him on hold and my lead tells me not to send another tech, because* something *must have happened. Instead I was to email the local office and refer the customer to them. Fair enough. As I come back to the line, I hear Mr.Grr speaking to someone that sounded like a police officer.*\n\n**Officer**: ... well sir, if you threaten them or make them feel uncomfortable while they're on your property, they are well within their rights to disconnect your service and leave the area.\n\n**Mr.Grr:**  Alright alright, you made your point, you're siding with them. It's still bullsh-\n\n*I attempt a few times to get Mr.Grr's attention while he's complaining to the officer, and he finally hears me.* \n\n**Me**: Mr.Grr? Thanks for waiting for me. Per my lead's direction, I need to refer you to the local office to have this issue resolved. Can I get some contact info from you?\n\n*I take his information and forward it on, then end the call.*\n\n**Epilogue**:\n\nI found out later that the customer had been antagonizing the field tech while he was trying to fix the downed line. The customer began to threaten violence, so the tech reached out to his supervisor, who gave him permission to disconnect the customer and get out. Apparently Mr.Grr did not learn his lesson the last time, as he antagonized the next tech that came out too. The GM has since closed Mr.Grr's account and flagged his SSN so that he cannot have service with us ever again. Which sucks for him, because I think we were the only ISP in that area. ",

        "text": "In which an arsey woman (AW) tries to blame your modest hero (Me) for her own stupidity. I knew she was going to be trouble from the way she sighed and huffed through the ID process.\n\n\n\nAW- 'I got a letter today saying I'm in debt and you're going to send a bailiff. I always pay my bill on time and I'm disgusted. What are *you* going to do about it?'\n\n\n\nI apologise, but checking her account I can see that she hasn't made a payment in over six months- the point at which the collections department swings into action.\n\n\n\nMe- 'I can see you have a number of bills unpaid, which has put the account into debit.'\n\n\n\nAW- 'Yeah, well I haven't had any bills. I pay my bills when I get them.'\n\n\n\nMe- 'Well let's see. Ok, so you get a discount for managing your account online, we send the bills via email.'\n\n\n\nAW- 'No, no, I haven't had any bills. I can't pay if I don't get a bill.'\n\n\n\nMe- 'No emails at all?'\n\n\n\nAW- 'No. What are you calling me a liar or something?' *As I'm sure you understand, this makes me extremely suspicious*\n\n\n\nMe- 'Are you in front of your computer at the moment? Excellent. Ok, I'd like you to check your junk folder. Sort by (company name).'\n\n\n\nThere follows a deep, uncomfortable silence. I can hear her scrolling and clicking, and I decide to let her speak first. No rush from me.\n\n\n\nAW- *Eventually* 'Well this is ridiculous. Why did you send it through as spam?'\n\n\n\nI explain that it doesn't work like that, and as she's chuntering on I poke around in her account. Oh look, she's been in collections before, she *never* pays her bills on time, and she's having extra money taken to cover the hundreds and hundreds she owes us. All covered in notes left by an extremely thorough colleague who had confirmed her consent to this arrangement. I break this as gently as I can, and it doesn't go well.\n\n\n\nAW- 'No! No! I never agreed to anything! I want your name, your FULL NAME!'\n\n\n\nMe- 'My name's Onion. I don't give out my surname, but I'll happily give you my logi-'\n\n\n\nAW- 'You've been very *rude*. You accused me of lying!' *I didn't, and this is the second time she's mentioned it. Hmm* 'I shouldn't have to pay this. You sent me a bill that I didn't get and now you're saying I've got to find hundreds?' *I think I hear the sound of a well-practised crying fit cranking up, so I put her on hold*\n\n\n\nI chickened out slightly at this point. I can't do anything with the debt arrangement, especially as it's disputed, so I transfer AW to collections, giving the operator a heads up on what she was getting.\n\n\n\n\nI'm constantly amazed by the assumption some people make that if a bill doesn't magically appear in front of their face, with no effort on their part, then they *simply don't owe any money*. I suspect this woman holds on until we're almost ready to cut off her meter, pays a fiver and starts the cycle again.\n\n",

        "text": "I started at this company just a few months ago after a move, dealing with handling account details of life insurance policies and sending out forms to get things changed like beneficiaries, the actual owner of the policies, even cashing out the policies completely. \n\nNaturally, our security process is somewhat involved. Name, policy number, date of birth, address, with the social security number being a fallback in the event the date of birth isn't on there. You can probably imagine how much moaning and groaning our callers do when they have to go through this process.\n\nWhat I've grown to resent the most, surprisingly, are the agents. These are the folks who have advising certifications, the rights to sell insurance to people, and the ability to assist with policy maintenance in person.\n\nSo, what do they do with their incredible certifications? Just this past month I've seen agents neglect to send in forms they helped clients fill out, agents signing people up for policies they didn't ask for, lying about the new policy's coverage, and, most surprising of all, I've seen an agent refuse to help a longtime client because that client had us send the agent a message asking them to call the client back. We're talking the agent going full on Willy Wonka \"Good DAY, sir!\" on this poor guy who just wanted some clarification. \n\nNot to say that there are some very special clients who wind up on my line. People complaining about the IVR, the security check, why their policy from 1945 is only worth $500 after all this time... but, this call takes the cake.\n\nImmediately after I identify myself, I can hear the anger in the client's voice. To her credit she lets me get through security, and proceeds to lay into me about how I'm the fourth person she's spoken with regarding this issue: she keeps getting her beneficiary change forms sent back, with a letter saying that she didn't sign the signature form. She was under the impression she never received this portion, and has spent a month trying to get the changes done.\n\nI check it out, find that the paperwork set (three pages in total) came through just fine, and had her look at the forms she received. She had three copies of the signature form sitting around on her end, she just never bothered actually looking before scattering them to the winds.\n\nI hope my expert paperwork advice will be enough to ensure the next call from her will end in a \"Yes, your beneficiaries are set...\"\n\nBonus round! A real gem I just had. \nClient says, \"OK, I need a name change done, I'm getting divorced.\"\nI respond, \"Sure thing! You'll just need to fill the form out and send us proof of divorce.\"\nShe then objects, \"Why do I need that? Can't you just do it for me?\"\n\nIf I could just do it for you I wouldn't be sending the form...\n",

        "text": "So I got this customer aprox. week ago; I can't remember exactly. As a result, dates are an approximation. I will be `ME` and the the customer will be `MR. A` for Asshole!\n\n---\nCall comes through. \n\n&gt; **ME**: Hello and welcome to `ABC Banking.` You're speaking to Peace. How can I help?\n\n&gt; **MR. A**: I am outraged!!! I sent a cheque on 13^th of this month. I now have received a letter telling me you have stopped it because there are stops on my account. THIS IS UNFAIR!!!\n\n&gt; **ME**: Okay sir. I am really sorry that that has happened. I can't think as to why it would have stopped your cheque. Let me just get you through security first so that I can help and assist you today.\n\n&gt; **MR. AA**: Ugh not this again!! I am sick and tired of you're stupid security. You're going to tell me everything is okay when it clearly fucking isn't!!\n\n\nOkay, I hadn't even passed security with this guy or looked at his account and he's losing his mfking shit. So help me God...\n\n&gt; **ME** (Security having been done): Thank you for that sir. So what happened with the cheque? Can you please start me from the top?\n\nI wanted to get him to tell me what happened in one go, so he would then shut up for most of the call. \n\n&gt; **MR. A**: So I made an account payment to my builder and it was *REJECTED!!* That was at the start of the month. it was for £8,000.00. But you didn't let it go through, did you!! My builders walked off because they hadn't been paid a week later!! MY WORK WAS STOPPED!!!\n\n&gt;&gt; I then had to go in to the branch in [city] and had to explain everything to them. They rang you guys IN FRONT OF ME! and you [a dickhead advisor] told us that you were sorry that the payment was stopped and informed that the branch could make the payment again as there were no blocks on my account. I made a cheque payment to the builders a few weeks ago and now I have got a letter telling me you've BLOCKED THE FUCKING CHEQUE!!!!\n\nNow he was completely going berserk at the situ (and me) and I wasn't going to tell him to stop. Yet. I was reading the notes on his account. Turns out the advisor who told the branch to make the payment again didn't update System X. Meaning, yeah the branch can remake the payment (as it will be a member of staff making the payment, it will go through) but if you don't update System X the customer cannot make any payment to that account or any other account. Regardless of how the payment is made. \n\nCheques are manually processed. The advisor fucked up. I was extremely pissed because he wasn't a rookie. He had been with us for a long time and should know one of the easiest processes that we have. \n\n&gt; **ME**: I'm  really sorry for the inconvenience that this has caused you. The advisor had misinformed you of the process. Whilst he did ensure your £8,000.00 went through he did not update the system. However, I have fixed that for yourself. I will need to trace the cheque and see if there are any notes attached to it. May I take the cheque number, please? \n\n&gt; **MR. A** (mumbling): FUCK.THIS.SHIT!! (clearer) IT'S 011-FUCKING-00!! Dickhead!!\n\n&gt; **ME**: Sir! I am on your side. I have admitted that the previous advisor with whom you spoke to was incorrect. I have rectified that error. Please allow me, now, to trace and locate your cheque. Number 01100. I won't be spoken to in that manner.\n\n&gt; **MR. A**: Well the cheque *needs* to go through ASAP!\n\nSo at this point I put this... person on hold whilst I tried to trace this ghost cheque. I found it. Except it wasn't for £4,000.00 nor was it issued and cashed this month. or this year. Nope, it was cashed in 2016. For £70.00. \\****facedesk***!*\n\n&gt; **ME**: Sir, I have found that cheque. Except it was cashed in 2016. For £70.00. Are you sure that's the cheque number?\n\n&gt; **MR. A**: YES! It's 011- *ooh* Sorry, it's actually on my wife's account. (Give's wife's. details).\n\nSONUVA...!! So I bring up the account and it turns out he isn't named on it. Meaning due to DPA I can't confirm anything on the account. *Sigh*.\n\n&gt; **ME**: Sorry for the wait there sir. Unfortunately, I am unable to discuss anything in relation to your wife's acccou-\n\n&gt; **Mr. A**: -Get me your complaints department. This is fucking bullshit!!\n\n&gt; **ME**: Yes sir.\n\nBye Felicia. It isn't my fault you gave me the wrong info. I really hope he never got anything, even though he probably needs some compensation for the previous advisor's mistake. \n\n---\nEDIT: fixed a few typos.",

Can you please transfer me to a supervisor or manager? \n\nMe: Of course I would be happy to try and find a supervisor for you. Please hold.\n\nNow, I am instructed to call a number and wait for two minutes. If hold is longer than that, take the information down and forward it. I wait the two minutes and return to the call. \n\nMe: Thank you for holding. Unfortunately I was unable to get a supervisor on the line. I have to forward the information over. \n\nMa'am: J, this is really unacceptable. You can't transfer your phone and now you're saying you don't have a supervisor available. We really need to speak with someone who can solve this issue.\n\nMe: yes ma'am I understand the frustration. unfortunately I do not have a supervisor available to assist this issue. \n\nMa'am: J this is really unacceptable and odd. I need to speak with your supervisor. \n\nAt this point she's starting to get angry and you can tell, so I look up steps to assist with an upset member. It instructs me to call a different number and inform them of the issue and that they are upset. I speak with an individual and after about 3-4 minutes, he states that the person who can assist is not available. Okay. Once again they are upset and I'm unsure what to do. The individual instructed me to take down the information and forward it over. okay dude thanks for the help.\n\nMe: Thank you for holding ma'am. I spoke with an individual who said they are also unable to assist. They will need the information sent over to them and you will receive a call back.\n\nMa'am: J. This is totally unacceptable. This is uncalled for.  You cannot assist with transferring me and now you say you spoke with an individual. You're being very vague. J, we need a supervisor.\n\nMe: ma'am I do understand I am unable to provide you a supervisor as there are none available. \n\nMa'am: No, J, I need to speak with a supervisor, thank you.\n\nAt this point I am getting really pissed off. I've exhausted my options and everything states to forward the information and she won't take the answer. I can start to feel my pulse jumping up stairs and my adrenaline kick in. I can start to feel myself shaking. \n\nMe: Ma'am. One again. I do not have a supervisor available for you to speak with. The best I can do is take the information down and have someone return the call.\n\nMa'am: J. We need a supervisor. You're being very vague saying you can't transfer calls and that this \"individual\" you spoke with tells you to do what you were trying to do at the beginning. It is very odd. We need to speak with a supervisor.\n\nMe: ma'am. I do understand. Again. There is no one available for me to get you to speak with. My only option left is to forward the information.\n\nMa'am: J, no. We need a supervisor thanks.\n\nMe: Ma'am, I do not have one...\n\nMa'am, J, we need a supervisor. Thank you \n\nFrank: Can you at least look to see if I have an account open with you guys? \n\nMe: Yes sir I can use your social to see if it pulls an account up.\n\nMa'am: J, why didn't you ask to do this earlier in the call if you had the ability?\n\nI'm beyond pissed at this point. I'm shaking. Heart pounding.  I think to myself, I though you said there's an account open. But whatever. \n\nMe, Completely ignoring her: Sir what is your social so I can see if there is an account open?\n\nI look the social up and there is NO ACCOUNT. Frank feels relieved. He says at least that's good. \n\nMa'am, feeling the need to continue: J, we need to speak to a supervisor. We need to see what is happening with Mr. Frank's information.\n\nMe: Ma'am, as I have stated multiple times. There is no supervisor available.\n\nMaam: J, get us a supervisors supervisor then please.\n\nBITCH WHAT\n\nMe: ma'am there is no one for me to get to speak with you. I have told you and I really don't know what else to tell you at this point.\n\nMa'am: J get us a supervisors supervisor.\n\nMe: I don't have anyone available. Again I have exhausted my options. I can only forward the info over to someone and they will call you back. I can't give you any more information because I have none. I don't know what else to tell you. \n\nMa'am: J this is unacceptable. telling us what you originally told me that you wanted to do, you can't transfer phone calls, you spoke with an individual who said to so what you originally wanted to do. I need to speak with a supervisor to get this resolved. \n\nMe: Maam I'll try once more to get a supervisor. If they don't answer within 2 minutes I will return to the call \n\nMa'am: well J now you're going to just disconnect from us \n\nMe: No. I said I will try and get a supervisor and if I don't I will return to the call.\n\n\n\nImmediately I place them on hold and try to get a supervisor. By this point we're at half and hour where I tell her the same thing over and over. Im beyond livid at this point. Shaking like a meth addict going through withdrawal. I stand up and tell the people around me I need someone to take over because I'm going to lose my job if they don't. A mentor (step before manager) said I am able to get a coach (manager) to take it over if you're having trouble.  THANK YOU JESUS BEFORE I GET FIRED. I was able to get a coach to take over. I explain the situation, she can see I'm visibly upset and gets on the phone. At this point I block out the remainder of the conversation because I'm trying to breathe and calm down. The coach states exactly what I said and was on the phone for another 5 minutes with this woman.\n\nI had to step away because I couldn't hold it together. I was shaking terribly and I knew my adrenaline was pumping. My lunch was 15 minutes later. During that time I was offered another job that will put me on the career path I want to go. Here's to not having anymore maams.",

        "text": "Ok, I used to work for an outsourcing company for a client based in the UK. (Client is a retail store that you purchase items either in shop using a catalogue or else online.)\n\n\nWell, one day I'm just answering calls and dealing with customers as usual when I get this woman calling through. I'll just call her L (lady) and refer to myself as M (me).\n\n\nM: Hi, thanks for calling Shmargos, you're through to M, how can we assist you today?\n\n\nL: Hi there, I was wondering how I go about getting 20 pounds back for an item that has changed in price since I purchased it.\n\nNow this isn't a strange occurrence as if a price goes down on an item within 30 days, we give the customer the price difference as a refund. I get her order number off her and put it into the system and see she bought a Trampoline for £110. I then open up our company website and see that it's now went up in price to £130 pounds. I'm sure you call all see her misunderstanding here.\n\n\nM: Could you please give me a little bit more information as to why we owe you £20 as I can't seem to see anything here in the notes.\n\n\nL: Well I purchased it for 2 weeks ago for £110 and now it's up at £130. That's a 20 pound difference so I believe you owe me that amount.\n\n\nM: I'm sorry but this wouldn't be the case as you actually got it cheaper than the current retail value. We only issue that sort of refund on the difference if it was cheaper than when you bought it and was brought to our attention within 30 days.\n\n\nL: This is absolutely unacceptable, I can't believe you would withhold money that I am rightfully owed. I DEMAND TO SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER! (Mental how fast customers want to escalate shit as soon as it doesn't go their way)\n\n\nM: Again, I'm sorry but there is no way I'm putting a manager on regarding this as there is nothing that can be done regarding this refund.\n\n\nL: Are you refusing to put a manager on for me? I know my rights and I have a right to demand a manager. (There is genuinely nothing that states customers can't be refused a manager. Company also has no policy regarding this unless there's nothing we can do in regards to like a missing item or fraud)\n\n\nM: Yes, I am not willing to put a manager on to take over this call as there is no problem here. We have no policy in place where we give customers money if the price goes up. I apologise if you misunderstood what our policy was on price changes but it's just something we can't do.\n\n\nL: Well this won't be the end of this. I'm going to call trading standards and go down to citizens advice. Then you'll be sorry. Thanks for nothing. *Hangs up*\n\n\nIn hindsight she was quite polite compared to some mental folk I got but that one stands out the most because I just found it mental that she never understood why she wouldn't be getting any money.\n\n\nI was gone from there like 2 month after that anyway as the client cut the amount of agents it needed in half but I really hope that woman tried to escalate the situation and got laughed at.",

(company long ass greeting and account verification )\n\nMW: this is about my order\n\nMe: I see you UPS shows your most recent order as delivered X hours ago. Is this the order you’re inquiring about? Did you receive it?\n\nMW: yes, of course I did, that’s not the problem!\n\nMe: ok ma’am, did you receive everything in your order? Did you receive your invoice (and a bunch of other required questions)\n\nMW: yes! My box is just fine, everything came, YES YES YES to all that you asked!.....\n\nMe: my apologies ma’am, may I ask what is your concern? \n\nMW: finally! I wanna place a complaint to the UPS lady that delivers my boxes\n\nMe: I’ll gladly help you ma’am but I’ll also like to suggest you to forward this directly to UPS so it can be processed faster. (Pretty much required to say this as ours would do much) Tell me, what is your complaint?\n\nMW: that woman doesn’t respect me or my home!!!!\n\n(Silence while I wait for her to give actual details)\n\nMe: I’m sorry, can i have a bit more information so that we can put as much detail as possible on the complaint? \n\nMW: ok, this woman doesn’t ring the bell nor leaves the boxes at the front door. THIS WOMAN (she’s getting angry at this point) JUST ENTERS MY HOME AND LEAVES THE BOXES IN MY LIVING ROOM TABLE!!!!\n\nMe: (knowing this is not a normal thing I go full empathy) I’m sorry MW, this definitely should be happening, I’ll forward this complaint to our shipping department so it can be forwarded to UPS.\n\nMW:  (at this point exasperated and full on rant) yes! I’ve talked to this woman before and she stopped but now she’s back at it AGAIIIIIIN!!!!\n\nMe: I’m sorry, I’ll include all of this, MW.\n\nMW: I’M A MARRIED WOMAN, I HAVE ALL THE RIGHTS TO WALK AROUND NAKED IN *MYYYYY* HOUSE!!!!! I could had been having sex in MY living room and SHE WOULD HAVE WALKED RIGHT INTO ITTTTT!\n\nMe: (holding back the chuckles for the sass in this) in sorry MW\n\nMW: IS IT BECAUSE IM A BLACK WOMAN THAT SHE DOESNT CARE!? SHE COULD HACE WALKED IN TONME AND MY HUSBAND HAVING SEXXXXX!!!! IT IS MYYYY HOUSE\n\nMe: (muting to not lol on the phone and trying to grasp what is due on the complaint) I’m sorry ma’am I’m forwarding all of These details to the appropriate department \n\nMW: (keeps on ranting) \n\nMe: explains complaint has been sent and offers further assistance....",

I just want to take a moment (or hour depending on how long it takes to type this) to vent about how stressful my job is. Like I said I work for a  call center and was just transferred from Credit Customer service (statements, payments, interest, w/e) to Furniture and Bedding customer service (furniture deliveries, manufacturers defects, inspection setting etc). I have been reading these posts all day and have not seen one post regarding furniture and bedding customer service so I though I would shed some light on that department. It's absolutely fucking miserable compared to credit customer service.... I was just forcibly transferred to the department (with no pay raise, go figure...) and it is ten-fold worse than credit. Let's see where to start on the journey to my definition of hell, well, for one, credit customer service is very black and white and FBCS (Furniture and bedding customer service) is very gray. In credit I had all the answers, like, \"Why is my bill so high?\" me: \"Well because you spent x, y, and z\" ..... \"Why am I being charged interest\" me: \"because you're only making the minimum payments on your balance and we charge a fee for you to borrow our money\".... FBCS is just, fucking, disgustingly, gray.... \"Why did my delivery today get canceled?\" me: \"Well IDK but let me check with the warehouse\" ...... \\*calls warehouse\\* ..... \\*warehouse doesn't answer\" ... me: \"I'm sorry I tried reaching out to the warehouse, however, no one seems to be responding so I'm going to send an e-mail to them to get in contact with you ..... maybe ..... in 24-48 hrs..... \"This is my THIRD exchange on my couch and it came damaged also, WHY???\" ..... me: \"I'm sorry I don't know why your 3rd exchange came damage and the warehouse couldn't even be bothered to, I don't know, inspect the furniture before they delivered it\" ....... I mean like seriously, I get people who work at call centers have to fix, and represent other people's fuck-ups, but oh my lord Jesus Christ, why can I not at least have an answer to give to these customers?????? I mean I call my supervisors constantly and most of the time they can't even answer the question and the response is \"send an e-mail to the warehouse asking someone to get in contact with the customer in 24-48hrs\" .... Like no, these customers are not going to take that answer because they call us looking for answers we cannot fucking give...... \n\nThis job is nothing but making up answers to give to customers and also arguing with customers about why their furniture (which was inspected by a technician) is not defective. This department, 50&amp;#37; of the time requires us (call center reps, sales people, warehouse) to follow up with the customers, but because we aren't given the time to do follow ups (due to high call volume) NOBODY CALLS THE CUSTOMER BACK. What I deal with constantly is why no body let the customer know that their delivery was canceled for the day (probably due to the driver calling out sick and they have no one else to drive the route), their inspection results on potentially defective furniture, when damaged furniture gets delivered (the drivers say that someone will call to follow up, but no one does and they have to report damage and property damage within 3 days for us to do something, so kind of a bullshit process when they call back a week later saying no one called them). Not only do we deal with the customer's infinite wrath of fury (10 times more extreme than angry credit customers), we have to deal with sales associates calling in for the customers demanding stuff we cant do for the customer and belittle and yell at us because it affects their commissions, they aren't too bad actually because I'm just as an asshole back to them when I know I'm right.... \n\nAnd then there is the fucking \\[non\\] defective furniture crowd. No matter if we send a technician to inspect the customer's furniture for potential defects and they take pictures for us to see that it's not defective, the customer WILL NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER AND ARGUES AND ARGUES AND ARGUES and escalate calls to supervisors who end up bending over for the customer because they don't want to deal with them themselves and we have like 3 supervisors to handle calls from all over the US. I'm like, WHY THE HELL AM I TRYING TO ENFORCE POLICY WHEN YOU PEOPLE ARE JUST GOING TO GIVE THE ENTITLED AS FUCK CUSTOMER WHAT THEY WANT???? The customer also loves to argue about why they shouldn't have to pay a 15&amp;#37; usage fee for returning a mattress that they don't like.... Like We CANNOT resell the mattress once it hits the home, we have to destroy the mattress and lose all profits because it's against the law to resell that mattress for health reasons. \"BUT WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO PAY A USAGE FEE WHEN I GOT THE WRONG MATTRESS\" .... me: \"Ma'am, you just told me what your mattress tag says, we sent you the correct mattress, you obviously don't like it and we have to charge a usage fee because you want to return it and we lose all profits from that mattress sale\" .... \"WELL I WANT TO SPEAK TO A SUPERVISOR AND I'M GOING TO SUE FOR FALSE ADVERTISING\"...... \n\nIt's constant arguing and arguing from customers and other fellow employees who work on a commission and freak out when they think they're going to lose a sale, however THEY ARE THE ONES WHO LIE TO CUSTOMERS BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT GOES ON BEHIND THE SCENES AND THEN TELL CUSTOMERS TO CALL US BECAUSE WE CAN FIX ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING FOR THE CUSTOMER AND THEY DON'T WANT TO TELL THE CUSTOMERS THE TRUTH BECAUSE THEY MISS OUT ON THE SALE..\n\nThe good part about this job is that we aren't grilled that much for staff time, AHT, AUX time whatever... Like they say something but really they won't fire us for it because the turnover rate is absolutely unreal that they'd rather have a shitty performer who knows what they're doing vs. hiring someone new who  50&amp;#37; of the time quits anyways. This is just a whole new level of hell that I'm not used to but I've been applying to other better paying call centers and can't seem to get a fucking interview because of their 200 question personality test that give you an automated response as to why you wouldn't be a good fit for the company... so I guess I have to deal with this bullshit for a little while and I'm absolutely depressed at what it's come to.... \n\nsorry for the long post but I just wanted to vent and hope some people enjoyed reading ",

        "text": "I volunteer at a helpline for youth. We provide anonymous peer support, and while we have training, we aren't professional counselors. The idea is that callers can talk to someone with similar life experiences, in a similar age range.\n\nThe line is sex-positive, and we often get calls about sex &amp; sexuality (especially since we specifically serve youth.) However, we also get fantasy calls from people who get off on talking to us about sex. Those calls are totally inappropriate, and are often coming from older men who are fully aware that they may be talking to a minor.\n\n---\n\nYears ago, I had just finished my training, and had been in the call room for a couple shifts but hadn't answered any calls yet. This was probably my third shift, and when the phone rang, I was the only one available. I had to take a real call at *some* point, and this seemed like as good a time as any, so I answered the phone.\n\nThe caller had some concerns about sex. A few minutes into the call, I could hear a muffled thumping sound in the background. When I heard a small moan, I realized he was masturbating. \"Can I put you on hold?\" I said, and didn't wait for an answer. I was starting to panic, but to my relief, the caller hung up. I guess being on hold wasn't really what he was looking for.\n\n---\n\nI volunteered for a while, but left when I got sick. However, I really missed the line, and a few years later I was finally well enough to return. I answered my first call in years, and it's an older man claiming to be a teen, telling me a story about recently losing his virginity to his mom. Yep, it was another fantasy call - I actually recognized the voice (and the general theme) from years ago. Rather than feeling panicked, I actually felt really confident. I told him he was misusing the helpline and sexually harassing me. He begged me to keep talking, so I said \"nope\" and hung up.\n\nSo somehow both my first calls were fantasy calls (they're common, but not *that* common.) However, I think my technique improved...\n\nThose of you at business-type, incoming call centres - do you ever get sex callers? I imagine it's more common if the line expects you to be talking about your life, rather than a product or service, but I'm curious.",

Yesterday, I received a call from a user who I will call Lazy User. (LU) Now, LU was on a call for which a customer was missing some TV channels.\n\n\nLU has all the tools at their disposal in order to check to see if the customer has the channels on their account. If we see that the customer has the channels on their account but cannot see them, that is when I come in and get that escalated. Here's how the call went with LU.\n\n\nMe: Tier 2, this is u/devdevo1919.\n\n\nLU: Hi. This is LU. I have a customer here who's missing some channels.\n\n\nMe: Have you checked Tool 1 to see if they're paying for it?\n\n\nLU: Yes.\n\n\nMe: Okay, show me where it says it in Tool 1. \n\n\nLU: It shows it here under *Package*.\n\n\n*LU was correct*\n\n\nMe: What about Tool 2?\n\n\n*This is the tool that matters. It shows us everything programmed onto their account.*\n\n\nLU: Yes.\n\n\nMe: Where?\n\n\nLU *stuttering*: Uh, well, it should be under *Package* like Tool 1.\n\n\nMe: Did you check under *Package*?\n\n\nLU: There's a lot of things listed there. \n\n\nMe: I know there is. You have to click on each of these and go through them all so we can be sure that the channels are not listed.\n\n\n*There was about 50 different selections.*\n\n\nLU: That's a long process, sir. Can I send a ticket or escalate to you?\n\n\nMe: No, LU. You need to make sure the customer does not have these channels. You know you need to do this. In the time spent with me you could've been checking the sub-packages under *Package* in Tool 2 to see if the customer has the channels.\n\n\nLU: But sir, the customer is frustrated.\n\n\nMe: You still need to verify. Is there anything else?\n\n\nLU: *sigh* No. *click*\n\n\nThe best part is LU called back and got the coworker sitting next to me who basically told them the exact same thing and if they called back about this and had not provided proof that they verified, an email would be sent to their manager.",

        "text": "I used to work in a call center. If you know the actor Chris O'Dowd from The IT Crowd, Bridesmaids and the new Get Shorty TV series he used to work there (but not at the same time I did) and tells a story about his time there here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bJ4zh0NYEU. It was a charity fundraising call center, one of those that call you up and ask you to give a regular gift, ideally monthly to help X charity... Its no longer around so I might as well name it; Pell and Bales. It went into liquidation 2 years ago after being around about 25 years. If you weren't in when we called (or were just ignoring the phone) they'd call back later, often, I think I saw a 23rd attempt once but that was at the very end of a LONG campaign, but it was usually low teens. They said it wasn't a sales job but it was a sales job. We were often calling elderly people who it was obvious from the get-go they couldn't afford it but you had to ask. You had to ask 3 times. Each time was a smaller amount in the hope you would wear them down. It wasn't pleasant, but apparently, it is the most cost-effective way of fundraising 'apparently', although this accounted for people giving monthly for 4 years, so who knows... It was incredibly boring, and a little soul destroying hence why things like Chris' Tiger Swan happened. We were always trying to find ways to keep ourselves entertained. I once got 26 F1 drivers past and present into a Samaritans (suicide hotline) script because it entertained me and not one person, caller or superior complained. I think the fact I got 4 times the gifts using it helped, even if they had listened to my calls.\n\nI worked there for quite a long time until it destroyed my mental health, I could quite happily blitz and do 57.5 hrs a week when I was feeling good and this allowed me to take December of when my Seasonal Affective Disorder kicked in heavily, although the emotional damage probably knocked it into Bi-Polar Disorder and eventually full-on Depression as well as Anxiety. The night shift was extra well paid and was very quiet as we were calling Canada. Somehow it worked out cheaper for a UK call center to call over the internet than for an internal Canadian one to do it. I saw it as a way to earn more sacrificing evening home time for £15 an hour. So finding things to keep your morale up were important.\n\nWhen I started working there, there was a rule: campaign-related material only on desks. Whilst I wholeheartedly agree with no electronics people weren't allowed puzzle books, newspapers or textbooks. We were often dialing phone numbers that were out or would never pick up - mid-afternoon especially, we could go 20+ minutes without an answer. One late evening in a campaign whilst dredging the last unanswered numbers I actually fell asleep, feet up on the computer tower head back nap. After about 9 or so months there I discovered a trick that allowed you to get the radio between calls and that went around the center like wildfire. (If you are on T-Point log into your phone first before the system and it was there, we were always taught to log in to the system first then the phone. If you work in a call center, try it to see if you have that too)\n\nI say 'had', because as part of the fundraiser reps (they didn't recognize the union which is legal in the UK) that got rid of it. I think part of the fact I found a loophole of malicious compliance with the rules and kept it up was a noteworthy part...\n\nOrigami\n\nI was bored one day and started folding paper (most people doodled on the back of the printed scripts) and eventually I figured out how to make a box using 2 sheets. I initially started making them see how many boxes I could stack on top of each other when I was told to stop using the water cooler cups to do it to stave off boredom (I wasn't at my usual spot and for some reason the trick that allowed me to get the radio on my headset between calls I was at didn't work in this bit of the call center), then I started playing around with the boxes and the bits left over to create a way of connecting them together. I linked these boxes together and my first paper dog was created, I was trying to make a centipede but it was a lot more awkward than I imagined and the dog was created by accident.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/xNV9oMj\nThey were simple and fun to make and could easily be made even whilst on the phone, once you had the muscle memory. Many people asked for one so I did. I started using the printed out pages from the scripts and the charity data packs that we were given in the briefings which were more often than not thrown away. Eventually I had to tell people to save the packs they were given so I had the paper to craft with. I had a Campaign Manager come round once and try to tell me that \"Only campaign-related materials are allowed on desks\" So I took the head off the dog and flicked open the head of the dog and handed him 2/3rds of a script of the campaign I was working on. \"It is campaign-related material, as the rules state. There's no rule about it having to be in a certain shape\". He wasn't being paid enough to care that much so walked away knowing I was yet again with the rules\n\nhttps://imgur.com/KxPUuM8\nI was known for being an 'eccentric' and would often go straight from the evening shift at 9pm to my Uni's fancy dress night which happened once or twice a month. This meant on occasion I was in the call center in costume but it was within the dress code (they tried the day I came in as Beast from X-Men but I bought out the dress code and referenced the line about skin color. I agreed not to come in wearing face paint again but could stay at work that day - The fact I was in a suit probably helped) so they couldn't say anything - especially as people were often there in grungy stuff. I actually went as a cheerleader once (although I only swapped from thin black trousers to a mini skirt and took the t-shirt off to reveal my homemade Cheerleader top in the last 10 minutes. I kept my fake boobs in the fridge, which were Jello in Balloons, and stuffed them up so I didn't have to waste time at the end of the day when no-one would see) but I was walking round in high heels all day to practice (I'm Male) so other guys borrowed the shoes to try them out and were surprised how easily I could walk in them. The fact that I was known as 'a bit weird' probably helped me as I got a half-hearted \"technically you are right\" type of response and I went back to my paper folding\n\nAfter a while, I tried different sized cubes. My basic design was made using 3 sheets of A4 but I halved it so had 6 sheets of A5 to play with as it allowed small sweet paper animals to sit on the desk as something cute to have on there as we weren't allowed to decorate our desks, especially as most people chose a different one each day, I just liked the same one as it had quick access to the kitchen to make tea (I'm English some its almost required) and in my personal sweet spot of the air conditioning as different places had different temperatures due to managerial preferences. The cleaners didn't throw them away either as the basically vacuumed and were told not to touch the desks in case something needed was binned.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/BV7hTzV\nIt was around this time the meeting of the fundraiser reps was coming up and I put my plan into action. I wound up making dogs of different sizes. I gave them to lots of people so they were all over the call center, anyone who asked got one. Campaign Managers could always see one or two looking around. I started experimenting with different animals I did a pig, then a magpie/turkey thing (although the original plan was a peacock using concertina for the tail, but it didn't work as I had hoped) I finally figured out my centipede, a rabbit sitting up on its hind legs and finally a giraffe. Well attempted giraffe, in the end, it became am 18 inches tall(ish) Brachiosaurus. It had a body from A3 paper, a neck and legs from A5 and an A4 head At some point, managers came over and asked me to get rid as they 'did not comply with the rules' so I grabbed a cube flicked it open to show my script. \"Scripts and campaign-related materials are allowed\" they knew I was right so they couldn't get me. Being one of the more creative reps stood me in good stead even though I'd only been there a while and was well past my probation and was consistently in the top 20% of people getting gifts with a 'wrap' time well under target.\n\nWe got the books/newspapers we wanted at the next Reps meeting. The menagerie of animals disappeared and was replaced by an Evening Standard. I still did the occasional dog though as they helped my anxiety, I still do, as they are cute and if I'm 'glitching' (as I call it) a 15-20 minute dog from a couple of flyers settles me nicely. Other people bought the study materials in so they could do uni coursework. Other people bought coloring books, Sudoku puzzle, and crosswords in, a surprising amount of people bought in knitting and crochet in aswell, card games too, although as long as we weren't gambling whilst playing. There was a noticeable shift in morale, you could see the tension in people bodies lessen. The overall 'wrap' time in the call center dropped about 6% across the board as people weren't taking extended loo breaks as they could actually not be bored to death between calls.\n\nIt's still my joint-favorite thing I did there as a rep, the other was leading the reps in the pay rise negotiations. Reading the City AM and standard taught me about things like tactics, useful managerial speak phrases and the RPI and CPI difference which they tried to use against me but I countered that instantly to some shocked faces as they didn't think anyone would know the difference let alone why they were calculated differently.\n\nI enjoyed being a rep, just a shame the other part of the job broke my brain\n\nEdit: I thought this was way too long and way too petty for it to be gilded but it turns out I was wrong. Thank you to the anonymous person who bedazzled me",

This is pretty normal, because y'know, its a promotional rate, and it was a moot point because he was moving to a new location and getting to start over from scratch with a new promotion anyway. But he none the less turned this simple transfer of service call into a 30 minute ordeal, telling me all about his opinions of the company I work for, such as how we recently bought our biggest competitor (we haven't), we offer worse service than everyone else (its pretty much the same), and how he won't have to put up with us for much longer because google fiber is going to give everyone in his city internet (they aren't). \n\nHe capped the whole conversation off by telling me that because we had raised his price without telling him (we had told him) he was going to report us to the FAA. \n\nAbout once a week I think up a brand new witty retort, but in that moment I was about 20 minutes from the end of my shift.

        "text": "Hello TFCC, LTL, FTP. \n\nI have been working in the industry for a couple of years now and have a love/hate relationship with it. (As many of you also do). So here is a short story to entertain you. Apologies for any grammar mistake. I'm also paraphrasing. \n\n**Background** I was a Tier1 rep for a Prepaid Card company (a card that works as a debit card, but not related with a major bank, you can receive your paycheque or deposit funds at some convenience stores, etc etc.) I handled stuff like money transfers, password reset, card block/and disputes. \n\nHere we go:\n\n**$ME** - Thank you for calling ~~the hell~~ how can I assist you?  \n**$CX** - Hello! I need to know where the track button is, I can't find it.  \n\n &gt;What in the world is this dude talking about? We can't track anything on the online account.   \n\n**$ME** I do not recall a button to track in our online portal. What are you trying to track?  \n**$CX**-I want to see who I have referred. There should be a way to track who I have referred.   \n\n &gt;We did have a referral program. Refer our product to a friend, both get $20 in your cards.   \n\n**$ME** - We do not have a way to track your referrals, the only thing you can see on the -Refer-a-friend- page is how it works, and the button to refer someone, by placing his/her email address.  \n**$CX**-Yes you do! There is a button to refer and another to keep track of your referrals.   \n**$ME**-I'm sorry for the confusion, but at this time the page will only have the button to refer. \n\n  **$CX**- I saw that button, Don't tell me you don't have it.   \n\n&gt;Now this gets weird, because I don't have the slightest clue of what he is talking about. Now is time to probing questions.\n\n**$ME**-Okay cx, so let me get this straight. How did you see it? Where?  \n**$CX** I went to a meeting and the folks showed me how it worked. You can refer friends and check who referred you and the referrals of your referrals.  \n**$ME**-Hum..That is strange, what was the meeting for?  \n**$CX**-It was with Zipnadazilch people. They had a meeting to introduce us to your referral system.   \n**$ME**-I see. Look, our product is a card to get money to and use it as a regular debit card. We have affiliations with some companies, like (convenience stores) to provide discounts and benefits, but we don't have relationship with \"Zipnadazilch\" for our referral program. It is just to refer someone, not to create a network or referrals.   \n\n&gt;Then he starts to get agitated\n\n**$CX**- I want to talk to your supervisor, You obviously don't know what I am talking about!! *(sigh)*  \n**$ME**-I surely can transfer you to my supervisor, however, we don't have such a button. Our product is to enable people to use a card without a bank. We also help people to get their tax return. *(high season, busy AF)*  \nI have one question. When you saw how it worked, was it the website in action or was it a video being played?\n\n**$CX**-It was a video. *(bulb lights up)*    \n**$ME**-Look, I can assure you we don't have such button. We can check who referred you, to give you both the cash prize, but we don't need to show a tree of referrals. Our product is not to refer and get cash,  is to load money and use it. I think that video was made up. Someone could have used a website and made a video adding those features for you to refer people.   \n**$CX**-So you are a scam then? I SAID! I WANT TO TALK WITH A SUPPERVISOR!  \n**$Me**-No worries. I can transfer you. We are not a scam, I am just saying that \"Zipnadazilch\" might be a scam, since we do not have any relationship with them.  \n**$CX**-ARRRRGG!!! *(freaks out and hangs up)*  \n\nI was like @_@, perplexed, with the greatest WTF feeling. \n\nHours later, at home. I went and googled the \"Company\". A complete idiot-catching scam. Refer 4 people and get an iPhone, refer 10 and get an iPad, 100 for a trip to Hawaii-kind of scam.\n\nWeeks later I checked his account (I saved his acct #), he never called again. \n\nEdit: Formatting",

I work for a cruise company so in my department we take mostly calls from travel agents who sell our cruises.\n\nI had this one call the other day from an agent who had phoned previously to get flight times to one of our ships. Once she had booked the cruise it had booked a 14:40 flight however we apparently had told her it would be an 06:00 flight. \n\nI’ll be Me and the travel agent will be TA.\n\nMe: Nope, these are the only flight times we have and always have had for this airport leaving at 14:40.\n\nTA: You gave us flight times leaving early morning a few days ago! Are you going to cancel this booking down free of charge since the passengers don’t want to travel?\n\nMe: There is nothing we can do about the flight time, however I will get my manager to listen to the call and see what they suggest.\n\nI go away and my manager listens to the call within a few minutes and tells me that at no point in the call did we say those were the flight times for that airport.\n\nMe: Okay, so my manager has listened to the call and at no point in that call were those times given... if the passenger wants to cancel they would lose their deposit. \n\nTA: I have worked within the travel industry for 20 years and I know what I was told on that call! The passengers were in front of me when I made the call and I would be happy to listen to the call and play it out loud whilst the passengers are sat in front of me!!! I want to listen to the call right now and I will record it!\n\nI speak to my manager and he said he will be happy to go into a room, play the call out loud to her right now over the phone.\n\nA little while later he comes out of the room so I ask him what happened... he simply says she is going to go away and ‘think about it’. I asked ‘so were we right?’ He says... ‘Yep!’\n\nAn hour later I pick up a call to the same agent who starts asking me about cancellation fees or how much we would charge for transferring. HA! The entire call I was a right smug bitch and IT FELT GREAT. \n\nHow is your 20 years experience working out for you now????\n\n",

        "text": "Another lovely tale from the great position of customer service at a life insurance company. \n\nSome background, woman calls in freaking out because apparently the insurance agent that came to her home told her a whole bunch of things that she now thought meant something completely different. She went from super annoyed to crying then to not making any sense at all. DCL will be drunk caller lady and M will be me. \n\nM: this is M at insurance company, how can I help you?\n\nDCL: I had a payment come out of my account and I really needed that money for food and I don't know what happened to it, what is going on?\n\nM: Ok m'am calm down let me just get some info first\n\n*Proceeds to take info*\n\nM: Ok so from what I can see here you met with *insurance agent* on this day and signed some applications for insurance and also gave a check for $30*. I*s that right?\n\nDCL: well yeah but she told me I would get the first two months free but I only get one check a month from Germany and all I had left was $30 in my account and I gave her a blank check with my signature and told her not to cash it yet but it was still taken out and I gotta eat!\n\nM: well m'am first of all when you sign up for insurance you have to make at least one payment right away as that is the initial sign up fee which the agent would have went over with you. Also you just stated you signed off on a check so there must have been some sort of confirmation that you knew a payment would be taken from your account.\n\n*DCL begins to start crying and screaming at the same time*\n\nDCL: Well I need to get the money back to eat cause I don't have any money left and my neck is broken and I can't get outside on my own.\n\nM: Well if you want the money back it's going to take awhile as we would have to cancel your insurance, get you to sign a cancellation form and then it also takes time to send the check back to you. \n\nDCL: But I need to eat!!\n\nM: *well then why did you decide to buy insurance when all you had to your name was $30???* Well that is the best option I have for you at this time as you did sign off on the application and gave her a signed check so it will just take some time to get it back to you. \n\nDCL: fine just call me back then! *proceeds to hang up*\n\nSo after this lovely call I took my notes and sent them off on getting the policy cancelled for her, but little did I know is that shortly after I took the call the agent that helped sign up DCL called in and stated she met with the client shortly after. The agent then reported that this lady was *very* intoxicated, kept asking her to buy her beer and wanted to go over her insurance with her. So basically this woman calls in very drunk trying to get us to give her her money back so that she could buy more alcohol instead of the 'food' she so desperately needed. The agent even stated the woman was completely sober when signing everything over, even verified everything with one of our home office reps so she clearly knew what she was signing up for. \n\nDon't responsibly people.",

Most of our products came with a security measure that *must* be disabled before the device could be repaired.\n\nThis feature could be disabled in a couple of ways, but if the device was broken or you for some reason could not access the security feature directly through the device you had to do it online.\n\nMost people either called us for instructions or googled, but independent repair shops or tech stores could also help. \n\nNow, to disable this measure you had to log into your account, where you were shown two options: disable, or delete. To remove the measure you had to chose *disable*, since *delete* would only remove the device from your account list temporarily (until you connected to WiFi, which could be pretty much as soon as you reloaded the page).\n\nIt’s worth noting that we could NOT do this for the customers on our end, since it required sign-in and we never, ever had access to customer passwords.\n\nSo with that out of the way, let’s get to the story!\n\nThis smug dickhead called from a third party tech support store while helping a customer send their device off for repair. \n\nME will be me, and SD will be smug dickhead:\n\nME: “Thank you for calling, how can I help?”\n\nSD: (*On speaker*) “I’m trying to help this customer remove the security feature from their device online, but your website isn’t working. You’ll have to do it on your end.”\n\nME: “I’m sorry about that. I’m afraid I can’t do it from my end, but I’m happy to walk you through it.”\n\nSD: “Look, I do this multiple times a day. It’s not working. Do it from your end.”\n\nME: “I can’t do it from my end, sir. Let’s just go through it together and if it doesn’t work I’ll figure something out.”\n\nSD: “Urgh, *fine*!”\n\nI start guiding them to log in and navigate the website. SD keeps making exasperated notices and smug comments after each step, and keeps telling me to just disable it from my end. Keep in mind that the customer is still listening to this since we’re om speaker.\n\nME: “Okay, can you see the device there, and your options? It should say ‘disable’ and ‘delete’.”\n\nSD: “(*Sigh*) Yes! I’ll press ‘delete’ and it won’t work, and this will all be a waste of time.”\n\nME: “(*Doing a two-handed fuck-you dance in my chair to the screen*) No, you should be pressing ‘disable’. Try that.” I probably sounded smugger than strictly polite.\n\nSD: “... okay-that-worked-thanks-bye!” *Hangs up*\n\nBecause god forbid that I know our own product, right?

        "text": "Like I said in my last post on this sub, I work at a call center for an auto manufacturer. Occasionally customers call in asking for radio codes; whenever the battery on one of our vehicles is disconnected, the user is required to enter a code in order to use the radio. It's an anti-theft feature designed to prevent someone from stealing the device for their own use.\n\nIn order to recover the radio code, the customer must provide the radio serial number. Usually, we can generate the serial number electronically by walking the customer through a simple process. However, this process does not work on certain model years, and when that happens, the only way to recover the serial number is to have a mechanic pull the radio out of the dashboard to read the sticker on the back.\n\nA mechanic just called in to recover a radio code for one of his customers. He handed her the phone, and she and I determined that the electronic retrieval process would not work on her model year. I told her she would have to call back after removing the unit from the dash.\n\n10 minutes later, her mechanic calls back yelling at me, asking me why I would tell his customer to remove the radio. He said he had called in before to retrieve the code for that same vehicle, and the previous agent had been able to give it to him without a serial number. He said that perhaps I just didn't have enough experience at my job to know what I was doing, and told me to transfer him to someone who knew what they were talking about.\n\nI reiterated what I had told the customer. The radio code could not be retrieved without the serial number, and the only way to obtain the serial number would be to locate the sticker on the backside of the unit. I added that there was no record in our system of anyone calling in for that specific vehicle's radio code. He started going on about what a hectic day he had been having and continued to insult my intelligence by telling me that there were other ways to recover the code and that I was wasting his time. First I asked him to verify the vehicle ID number to make sure we were both talking about the same car. The number he gave me wasn't any vehicle ID I had ever seen for any of our models. Then he tells me he had the wrong paperwork and gives me the correct number -- it's the same one the customer gave me and, again, there was no record of anyone calling in for that vehicle's radio code.\n\nI humored him and tried walking him through the electronic retrieval process. Obviously, it didn't work. He still insisted that I didn't know what I was doing and said he would take the car to a dealership, where they would likely be able to help him without having the radio removed. Then he hung up on me.\n\nWhen he goes to the dealership, they're going to charge him a service fee -- radio code retrieval is free over the phone -- and the dealer representative is going to call *us* for instructions on how to retrieve it. \n\n**Edit:** Turns out there was record of a prior request for a radio code, but the previous agent didn't document what the code was or even how she had been able to to recover it.

        "text": "So first time poster here but have been reading these stories for awhile and I can relate to a whole lot of them (aren't call centers the best??) I apologize if the formatting is weird or not clear as this is my first post. \n\nSo for some background, I work at a life insurance company where I answer calls all day long for clients who have questions about their insurance, need to make changes or payments. I wish I didn't have to go over some of the things I do but a lot of the people I speak with have a hard time understanding the most simple concepts out there but those stories are for a different time. Queue this gentleman (we will call him J) and myself (will be M): \n\nJ: I'm calling about this letter I received and don't seem to understand what it is saying.\n\nM: Sure I can help, what's the letter going over?\n\nJ: It's going over some payments and insurance amounts but I don't even remember getting a policy with y'all. \n\nM: Ok so that letter is stating the insurance policy that was written for your wife that you signed off on about a couple of weeks ago with an agent who would have come out and spoke with you and your wife about it. \n\nJ: Oh yeah that lady comes out a lot to go over our insurance with another company but I don't remember taking out any more insurance with her...\n\nM: Well we have a signed application here for insurance that both you and your wife signed off on. Do you recall signing any paperwork with her?\n\nJ: oh yeah but I didn't read the application.\n\nMe Internally: (wait hold on....what?)\n\nM: Just to clarify, you signed an application, both you and your wife did, with this woman without even looking at the piece of paper in front of you?\n\nJ: well yeah she just said to sign and we just signed, didn't know what it was for but just assumed it was important. \n\n(you assumed it was important but you didn't even take a second to quickly read it over?)\n\nM: ok well that is what the form was for so that is why you have the insurance for your wife and it looks like you even did an interview over the phone where we clearly went over the application with you and your wife where you accepted the policy.\n\nJ: well my wife doesn't know what she's talking about \n\n(but you were on the phone with her!!)\n\nM: ok....well it's still a legally binding contract you signed off on and we received a check from you as well that we processed for payment. \n\nJ: YOU WHAT?!?! I DID NOT AUTHORIZE ANY PAYMENTS FOR THIS! WHY WOULD I WHEN I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW I WAS GETTING INSURANCE?!!?\n\nM: well sir I have a copy of the check you signed off on, do you recall filling out a check for the agent?\n\nJ: well yeah I just signed my name on the bottom of the check and left the rest blank for her.\n\nAt this point I was completely blown away by the fact that this husband and wife had no idea that they signed up for insurance even though we had a recording of them going over the policy with us, handing over a signed blank check to an insurance agent and then signing off on applications for insurance without even looking them over. \n\nM: ok well at this point sir we can do one of two things, we can keep the policy for your wife or you can go ahead and cancel it.\n\nJ: OF COURSE I WANT IT CANCELLED AND I WANT ALL MY MOTHERF\\*\\*\\*ING MONEY BACK AND THAT WOMAN WHO CAME AND DID THIS TO US IS NEVER WELCOME IN OUR HOME AGAIN! \\*\\*hangs up\\*\\*\\*\n\nwell ok then. So guy calls in confused on what he got in the mail, ends up screaming about the insurance he and his wife never knew they were signing off on, and proceeds to cancel everything. Honestly I can't understand how he missed what was going on when they both talked to someone and verified their info for the policy they were signing up for while also handing over a check!! And this is not the first time I've had a call where people have called to complain about signing off on forms that they didn't read....\n\nSeriously come on??",

Within a given time period I have to call the person back to go further with their application. \n\nThis online form makes sure that the person applying is eligible, so people knowingly put false information on the form to make sure I call them back, thinking that they will receive benefits even if they are not eligible.\n\nI call him, give him the usual introduction and we go through his form question by question (the script is written in a way where the questions on the form, and the questions asked by me seem a little different). We go through the form fine until we get to his current work situation.\n\nC = Customer\n\nMe: when did you last work?\n\nC: I got let go yesterday, so going to start looking for work now.\n\nMe: Sorry to hear that, do they still owe you wages or any holiday pay?\n\nC: Yes! They’ll pay me at the end of the month (about 2 weeks away at this point).\n\nMe: will it be over €xxx amount?\n\nC: Yeah, it’ll be €xxxx (a bit more than the threshold for ineligibility)\n\n*You can’t apply when you have over a certain amount money coming in from work, so I got a little annoyed as I know he purposefully lied on his form to make sure we called him*\n\nMe: Unfortunately you won’t be eligible to apply right now sir, contact us back the day after you receive your wages and we should be able to process your application then\n\n*his whole attitude changes*\n\nC: YOU ARE F@&amp;@ING JOKING ME!!!! I WAS TOLD I CAN APPLY FOR *benefit* THE MOMENT I GOT FINISHED! \n\n*he then proceeds to yell his current situation at me*\n\nC: I KNEW MY CONTRACT WAS FINISHING, SO I SPENT MY MONEY EXPECTING ME TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR *benefit*. I KNOW YOU CAN JUST PUT ME THROUGH FOR IT! SO JUST DO IT!!!\n\nMe: Sir, I will hang up if you.. *he interrupts me*\n\nC: I HAVE NO MONEY TO PAY MY RENT WITH! NO MONEY TO PAY MY BILLS! I DON’T HAVE ANY FOOD LEFT, AM I SUPPOSED TO JUST STARVE? THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE!!!!\n\nMe: Sir, I will connect you to *interrupts me again*\n\nC: NO! I WANT WHAT I AM ENTITLED FOR. YOU F&amp;@&amp;@&amp;@ C&amp;@&amp;.....\n\n\nI hung up, and left a note on his account about his behaviour. And sent his ineligibility letter to him with a huge smile on my face.\nHe spent all his own money because he expected the government to pay him (even though the whole process takes 7 weeks or so), all while he was waiting for a pay check from his old employer.\n\nI’ve dealt with people who I’ve felt really sorry for, as they were ineligible for very silly reason that I don’t agree with, but I liked telling this guy he wasn’t entitled for anything\n",

        "text": "I started lurking here after I started working Teir 1 tech support in a call center that belongs to a certain group of nerds with a blasted 1800 number. This got a little long, tl;dr at the bottom. Also, can't figure out flair, my b homie. \n\nMy job was mostly to troubleshoot and if that didn't work, pass it on to Teir 2. I was doing my thing, waiting for my shift to end when I get a call. At first it's a normal call about a certain coverage we offer for devices that plug in and light up and why she was playing X when she use to pay Y. \n\nUpon further digging, I find a PLETHORA of coverages that have been transferred from one device to the next as she swore they didn't work (I suspect user error) and took them back. Plus one that only covers anti virus protection and another that only covers software on a different device. Apparently, at some point she had purchased a plan (~149 annually) that covered one device for hardware and software issues, then the other plan (~99 annually) that covered software issues for up to 3 other devices. Plus she had been roped into purchasing an add-on hardware coverage because of the type of device she had purchased with the software coverage. (Though according to her, she was \"being nice and giving them an extra $100 cause she's just SO generous\" 🙄)\n\nSo currently we have 2 (technically 3 cause the hardware damage add on is an extra $100) plans covering 2 devices, both for hardware and software in some shape or form. Also there's the anti virus plan (~49 annually)  Expensive? Kinda but you can add other types of devices to the software coverage and it's also not my fault you didn't read what you signed 4 years ago. I've only been here 2 months lady. \n\nI did explain there was a plan that would kinda of do what she wanted but she would pay a reduced price for hardware issues. However, she'd also get coverage for basically anything that is tech based, regardless of where she bought it, what it is, so on and so on.\n\nAfter finally getting through (HA!!!)  to her what was and wasn't covered by what, she decides that I need to MAKE HER A SPECIAL COVERAGE PLAN THAT COVERS BOTH DEVICES FULLY and she didn't want to pay a cent more. She didn't care if \"I had to make one up for her but I needed to go onto my little computer and give her what she paid for\". *giiiiirl*\n\nBy this point my narc radar was urging me to \"nope!\" and promptly had me clock out the situation since A) that's not how this works and I've definitely explained how it does 2) you don't demand I do anything. Fourthly) I've been explaining the same 3 plans for 1 hour now and then spent another .5 listening to you prattle on about how nice you are. Red) I can no longer help you since I can explain plans but even if I could do what you wanted, my department can't take payments, you gotta go to billing. \n\nI had been trying to get her over to billing for about 45 mins cause they'll usually have more info on things of that nature but she had that narc selective hearing so that wasn't possible. (Did NOT understand that she couldn't make her own plan or it'd have been an option) \n\nFINALLY, she heard what she wanted I guess and let me transfer her but Jeez, know what you sign up for lady. \n\nAnd she did this crazy laugh everytime she mentioned how generous she was for \"giving\" an extra 100. For hardware protection. \n\nI apologize to whoever had to deal with her but 1.5 hours (supposed to be &gt;20mins) cause she won't take no for an answer and everyone who's supposed to be helping me keeps telling me to just \"deal with her and get her transferred\". I just couldn't. \n\nAnd I get it was expensive but there's literally nothing I can do but empathize and try to find a decent solution. I may be magical, but I can't pull that out my cauldron, my hat or my ass. \n\n\nTL;DR get told to make a special  coverage plan with my magical computer cause narc doesn't care to understand or accept what she paid for.  And I love the mute button cause rage. \n\n",

        "text": "Good afternoon TFCC. I come bearing a cautionary tale of woe, tragedy, and idiocy. I work for an ISP. (I'm aware, I'm the devil. Polish my pitchfork every night) doing tech support. If it don't work right, I try to fix it. I actually take pride in doing this, and most calls go well. As long as the customer isn't being a jerk. \nEnter Lord and Lady Slow-surf(LLSS) and myself (Me))\n\n\nMe: *generic ISP greeting*\nLLSS: My internet is slow! My husband can't get more than 30 mpbs and I'm paying for 200! How are you gonna fix this? \n\n\nI attempt to ask a few basic questions. (Does this a daily occurrence? Does it happen on multiple devices) \n\n\nLLSS tells me she doesn't know any of that and she's getting upset because I'm not fixing the problem. She takes the phone into what I'm guessing is her husband's office and he tells me that he thinks we're throttling him (we aren't) and the speed drops based on how much data he's using(it doesn't).\nI make a few more attempts to troubleshoot, and all I can work out is that they're having intermittent slow surf. \n\n\nBut they won't let me help them. \n\n\nThey just continue on about how it's not a modem issue or a signal problem.  Which it very well could be. And I could figure this out. If. They. Let. Me. Help. Them.\n\n\nFinally, I get fed up and tell them that if they are uncomfortable completing the troubleshooting with me over the phone, I'd be happy to set up a service call.  Which launches the husband into another tirade about how a field tech isn't going to help because it's happening on the corporate side. Eventually the wife agrees to the service call, and as I'm ending the call, I ask if there's anything else I can help with. \n\nLLSS: Well you didn't help us at all. *click*\n\n\nAlright then. I send an email to their local office and notate the account about their behavior during the call. I don't want the poor guy to go in blind. Then say a prayer for that poor field tech. \n\nAt least QA can't get me on this one. \n\n\n",

        "text": "I used to work as a SUP in a call center for rewards program, the kind where you earn points by making purchases that you can use to pay for future purchases.  I got an escalated call transferred to me one evening.\n\nThe caller wanted to return some items for a refund because she needed the cash back for her rent.  Problem was, she earned a LOT of points on that purchase and had spent those points already.  Our rules were, in a situation like that, is your cash refund would be reduced for the value of the points you had spent.  \n\n(Believe me this simple concept was very difficult for some people to grasp and caused many an escalated call.  I once had a lady demand I send her 15 cents in the mail because that 15 cents was not refunded to her credit card after a return she did and had already redeemed that 15 cents in points on a different purchase. I had to explain several times that I did not have access to her credit card account and could not add any credit to it but I gave her a dollar in points instead.  No, she wanted her 15 cents sent directly to her.  Ended up having to send her to my direct SUP.  Two for one story.  LOL)\n\nI explained this is what would happen if she returned those items from her first purchase.  However, *IF* she would return the items she purchased with the points first so they were all returned to her point balace, she would receive her full cash refund because the points could then just be subtracted from her balance instead of her refund. \n\nNope.\n\nTook almost an hour to explain that she couldn't keep the items that she got for free AND get her cash back.",

        "text": "Being in a call center so far, is an experience like none other.  good and bad.  having a warehouse and just general labor background, with just little education (HS diploma, some college) I  did not think i would get the job, let alone an invite for interview.  \n\na months in one of the CC companies, and i must say, I enjoy working inside, not opening boxes, stocking shelves, being a lackey (not saying it's not possible to go back to that).   But something about having a work station, office chair, and working inside when the weather is complete crap outside is a beautiful feeling.  Seriously.  And I am not even started with the company perks.\n\nEnough of that, Lets get it on.  Accepting my first call I did my best to be confident (pokes chest out),  memorize my script, and go with the flow, all while not thinking about Wolf of Wall Street or The Office in the back of my mind.  Well too late, the customer wanted something we did not handle and I lost my composure.  I beat myself up for days, especially when the department began explain things like average handle time to us which made me panic even more.  After a while I got it down smooth, down pack. Today, we handle customer payment's,  unrecognized charges along with a few other tasks.  \n\nNow, on to the customer service.   Never, in my life had i think people could be so discriminatory.  Being of color, I am pretty sure it passes through the phone.  The first time a customer joked she was glad an American had gotten the line, I was honestly shocked to say.  Then it happened again, and again here and there.  They come off as jokes, but most people really mean it!  Some, one in particular really got to me because she joked about how people from India have \"different\" names and she began to mock it.  As nice as she was at the beginning of the call, she hit me for an entire 360.    I just kept my end greeting going and hung up.  \n\nTime to time I get an occasional cuss out or smart mouth customer either because 1. they came through the line that way or 2. my inexperience begins to show.   Half of the no 2. customers are complain over something less than ten dollars anyway :) \n\nThank you for reading my small vent about my intro to customer service life.   Any tips, tricks please comment on how to survive !",

        "text": "I want to take a moment to personally thank all of you for making this reddit. I for one am 50/50 on my job, I really have no problem with what I do for a living, what I have an issue with is the \"assholes inside of the walls.\" Eventually over time even the strongest of call center agents, will be worn down and break. \n\nWelcome to my personal hell, it is my Hanoi Hilton of the mind. \n\nSo here is some background, we are a small operation. I work at a plumbing company that has two locations, a north location which handles the plumbing/drain work and then a south location which handles all of the major industrial operations. Our call center consists of 6 agents, NOW HERE IS THE FUN PART. One is pregnant (knocked up by one of the plumbers!) two are a mom and daughter team...the daughter is some 19 year old who got knocked up young and is a total idiot...will she remember what color pens you ordered Mr. Raymond K Hessel...perhaps? One works remote in another city...who more or less does whatever...and then there is the new girl a retiree who is confused about what to do half the time (but to her benefit she is trying), and then there is me...lil ole me.  We don't have metrics on how many calls you should take, no time limits, just look like you're working...yeah that sounds like fun, but with 6 agents working various shifts...its not fun when 3 other people fuck off and you're stuck with a backed up phone bank. Oh yeah there is no script...you say an opening line but after that everything is fair game!\n\nNow in theory we should have a supervisor...nah she sits at her desk and processes customer complaints...all...god...damn...day....long....so she can't really handle what goes on in the office, she just deals with the shit we fucked up and angry customers who think we charged too much (I have begun to wonder if we actually do honestly.)\n\nSo we have the backstory of the department....now to the meat.\n\nWe average roughly 300 something calls a day, more or less the agents book the calls, the dispatchers send them out...it should be simple and easy to do...NAAAAAAAAH there seems to be a major fuck up seemingly daily. The agents overbook the number allowed for booking (honestly...we get an e\\-mail daily), the techs don't really think some jobs at worth their time, and lastly that southern division...we can't even schedule them...\n\nYou call in with a broken water line \"yeah we will call you in like 3 days and tell you when we can send an estimator out...HAVE FUN!\"\n\nSo here is where it gets real fun....our supervisor is a new hire! They hired someone outside of the company who worked at another tradeskill call center...who replaced her predecessor who more or less drank herself to death each night and burned herself out and took a job at the front desk at reception....yeaaaaaaaaaaaah\n\nHave I got your attention? \n\nSo where do I fit in here...you must be wondering?\n\nSo I work the swing shift, meaning I cover late morning and early evening, it pays decent, and I didn't really have many complaints. Well it really kicked in when they tried to press gang me into working saturday for no difference in pay...I went to the overall department head and he said he would look into it. My boss came back and shit talked me at her desk loud enough for me to hear it with the dispatch manager....saying I was ungrateful and I was a little shit....okay...whatever...she eventually fucked off and during that transition phase the new boss was coming online...I got bored answering calls and started asking myself \"hrm....what can I do to improve my job.\" I started going around and building relationships with sales, billing, agreements, all these people who dumped shit on us and we had no idea how to work with...they eventually came to depend on me and trust me. Oh and I visited those south people to, and they loved me...and did my \"coworkers\" do that...nah those lazy cunts sat there eating pizza and mom and daughter started taking lunches together. This was ontop of constantly taking the most calls and having the fewest complaints...I was on fire.\n\nSo I kinda brush this off, I thought I was going to get somewhere...hope was on the horizon when the president of the company shook my hand and said I was really doing well and the owner mentioned me by name in a board room meeting saying \"who is this guy, he's great!\"\n\nYeah...so I sit down with new boss for my yearly review. \n\nPraise all around, being told I'm an asset, right arm of the department....ask about the prospect of a raise...\n\n\"Well erm, now isn't a good time...and erm well at my old company people in your job didn't get paid nearly what you did.\" Then post meeting I hear her shit talking me with the dispatch boss...\n\nSo you praise me, and then tell me I'm not worth what I'm paid...right...\n\nLets throw some gasoline onto the fire...the mom and daughter team...mom has checked out of her job and takes fewer and fewer calls, the daughter is a total fucking moron (how she works there still with the level of mistakes she made...like pissing off major clients and costing us thousands....) the remote girl had a stroke and is making mistakes like crazy...the new girl is confused on how to do her job...and the girl next to me  is pregnant and milking that card...and is dealing with her alcoholic baby daddy (and ditches me on the phones at night when we're getting slammed...to deal with him...because they boss fucks off at 4 leaving us alone.) \n\nSo where does this end....\n\nI was honestly burning up inside my mind, covering shifts, plugging holes, working OT, I was the yes bitch...I did it all for them...the shitters who I worked with...I carried them...even after I got shit on by my boss...and then then burnout happened. I took three complaint calls...violent ones...and the last one she just ripped into me. \n\nContext: we have delay calls, \"hey the guy is running behind...he will be with you when he can\" we typically do this halfway through a timeslot so to give you the impression we give a shit about you....yeah....so remote girl fucked off early and didn't do hers. Bosslady is buried in complaints and is out the door early and dumps them on me...at like...5 minutes left in the customers timeslot.\n\nYeah wanna guess how that went....\n\nI call an 89 year old woman.\n\nMe: I do apologize for the extended delay, we're running behind\n\nCunt: WHAT THAT IS UNFUCKING BELIEVABLE, FIRST YOU CALL AND SAY HE CAN'T MAKE IT ONE DAY, AND NOW YOU ARE TELLING ME THEY ARE LATE\n\n(at this point I'm mentally and physically exhausted)\n\nMe: Ma'am I am so very sorry, let me try and help you and see what I can do\n\nCunt: THIS IS UNFUCKING BELIEVABLE, I WAS WAITING ALL DAY AND MY HUSBAND HAS DEMENTIA AND WE HAVE THIS PLUMBING ISSUE THAT WE NEED DEALT WITH...DO YOU EVEN CARE...DO YOU EVEN CARE ABOUT US OLD PEOPLE...WHATS YOUR NAME, (REMOVED) DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHY I AM UPSET\n\nCUNT: IF YOU RESCHEDULE ME WILL THE TECH BE EXPERIENCED, NOT LIKE THAT MORONIC KID YOU SENT LAST TIME!\n\nMe: Yes ma'am he will be experienced, I will make you a priority monday for you because friday does not work for you.\n\nCUNT: THIS IS STILL UN FUCKING BELIEVABLE...YOU DON'T EVEN CARE...\n\n(see at this call center, we can't hang up on these people...because we can cause the tech to lose money which stirs up a further shit storm) \n\nMe: Ma'am I've been screamed at by three people today, I am honestly trying to help you....\n\nCUNT: OH YOU'VE BEEN SCREAMED AT HUH! WELL THAT ISN'T MY PROBLEM, YOU CAN'T FIX MY PROBLEM, YOU'RE UNFUCKING BELIEVA.....\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\nAt this point something in the back of my mind broke, I hung up on her. My phone tree I just flung it against the wall of my cube and the pregnant bitch who was on her cell phone was like \"really!?!\" I got up in the middle of a breakdown saying \"I'm done getting yelled at, I'm done, I'm done, I can't keep this up\" and my old boss at the front desk was literally wide eyed, and said \"dude just breath!\"\n\nIt's fuzzy, but I recall sitting in the stairwell hyperventilating...\n\nI do recall me going back to my cube, cleaning up my mess, and clocking out. I called my boss...\"I'm sick, I don't feel well, I'm going home.\" she more or less told me to not let those calls get to me in a condescending tone and that since I'm clocked out just go home.\n\nSo I call my bud who is the sales manager...more or less we chat for an hour and he more or less said \"dude you are underpaid, you are the only person we trust in that department, and honestly they won't fire you...they can't afford to....you're underpaid for what you do for us honestly...just take the write up and move on.\"\n\nSo boys and girls...pick this rant apart...I granted feel like I let the cunt get to me, but honestly I'm thinking it's time to start saying no around there, backing off, getting somewhat of a life back, and letting the \"supervisor\" sort out her own shit....",

I had to take the call because I'm trained in the small business department as well. \n\nI was on the phone with this lady who repeatedly asked me accounting questions. Every time she would ask an accounting question (ex: what account should I put this in?), I would tell her that I'm not an accountant and that she would have to speak with one to have her questions answered. I was on the phone with this lady for FOUR HOURS. I was exhausted because the call was going nowhere. In the last hour of speaking with her, something like this happened. \n\n**Me:** *Ma'am, like I have said several times before, these are accounting questions.  I'm not an accountant and I don't feel comfortable assisting you with this.*\n\n**Customer:** *This isn't an accounting question. I'm just asking you where this is supposed to go.*\n\n**Me:** *I'm sorry, you'll have to contact your accountant for that.*\n\n**Customer:** *But that costs money.*\n\nTough shit. ",

        "text": "Background: I work at a call center for a mail order pharmacy. I work as a SME (subject matter expert) which means that I get some extra responsibility with no extra pay. One such \"privilege\" is taking escalated calls.\n\nThe scene: A member's daughter was calling in regarding a prescription refill order that she placed on Monday. One of the items was split off from the main order and shipped on Thursday, where the others had shipped on Tuesday and arrived today.) Today is Friday. And the member has only 4 days left of the medication that was split.\n\nThe caller was one of the most unpleasant people I've spoken with *ever*, and was ranting and raving and screaming at me because this one item wasn't with the other two. The usual drivel: \"my mom could DIE!!!\" (she couldn't.) \"I'm emailing the board of DIRECTORS!!\" (okay fine, want my my employee id?)\n\nFinally I got around to offering a (very simple) solution: since there was a chance the member could run out of their medication, I explained that we could enter an override so her insurance would pay for a short fill at a local pharmacy, to hold the member over until the full 90 day supply arrives in the mail. All she would need to do would be to have the doctor call in the prescription to the local pharmacy.\n\nThe following is a (lightly abridged) transcript of a portion of the conversation.\n\n&gt;**Me**: So you'll just need to have her doctor call in that prescription to your pharmacy, and you should be able to pick up a short supply to hold her over.\n\n&gt;**Caller**: ARE YOU KIDDING ME? IT'S THE WEEKEND!! \n\n&gt;**Me**: Hmm, so they've already closed for today?\n\n&gt;**Caller**: WHERE DO YOU LIVE, MARS??\n\n&gt;**Me**: Utah, actually...\n\n&gt;**Caller**: WELL HERE IT'S AFTER FIVE O CLOCK!!! OF COURSE THEY'RE CLOSED!!\n\n&gt;**Me**: Hmm, okay. Well, you said she has four days left. Would you be able to have the doctor call in that prescription on Monday?\n\n&gt;**Caller**: ...\n\n&gt;**Caller**: ...\n\n&gt;**Caller**: ...\n\n&gt;**Caller**: ...you people are a bunch of asswipes.\n\nAnyway, the caller has a cousin who works as an intern at a national news station, so if you see this story on TV, now you know my side of the story.",

        "text": "Hello, another tale from when I was a L1 supporter at a phone company. TL;DR at bottom.\n\n\nIf being a L1 tech supporter at a phone company wasn't bad enough, having a questionable coworker could really mess up your day (and quote).  This story unfolds during my first 2 months at the company, and mainly focuses on the terrorist, that was one of my coworkers.\n\n\nFrom day one, it was obvious he was gonna be trouble. His attitude, the way he dressed, how he addressed people and spoke to them. I'm no psychologist, but it was glaringly obvious we were dealing with a full-blown sociopath. How he got the job is beyond me, but I guess the company was desperate enough to take in whatever they could get their hands on (average employee retention time was expected to be 2 months, that's how bad it was - I was there for 6 before I got fed up).\n\n\nHis usual routine was smarmy. Greasing the customer in every way to try and steer the conversation away from their problems. He did this so he could upgrade their subscription, add services and in general sell them anything he could, so he could meet the daily quota. Very rarely would he fix the problem at hand, that is, he would only try if it meant he could sell them something extra.\n\n\nHis technical skills were limited to that of a mentally challenged toddler, which meant that he would often make a problem worse by applying completely unnecessary and unrelated solutions.\n\n\nIf he couldn't fix a problem or couldn't sell anything, he would disconnect the customer and just add extra services and call it a day.\n\n\nFor obvious reasons, this meant that everyone else on the team had to clean up after him. Probably because he knew his actions were unethical, he would use an alias. So whenever a customer called in and mentioned this alias, we knew who was responsible for the hellstorm we were about to receive.\n\n\n*However, this story isn't about how he cheated, stole and lied to customers. No, it's about the karma train that was heading his away.*\n\n\nAfter about 5-6 weeks and several anonymous tips, our manager started observing him from afar. It was obvious that the manager were listening in on his conversations while parading about and helping newcomers.\n\n\nOn Friday of the 7th week, he was pulled aside by the manager and told that our boss would like a word with him. He took off his headset, with a completely misguided glee and looked around at the rest of the team. He then quietly proclaimed that he was probably going to get that promotion to manager, since he had been the top seller of the past few weeks. Little did he know what was about to hit him at mach one, and it was evident that he was utterly oblivious to his situation. The few of us who were aware of his little enterprise, just nodded and tried to hide the anticipation of what were about to happen.\n\n\nLittle more than a few minutes after he went into our boss' office, two policemen (not security) walked into our office and headed to the same office. One of my coworkers made a silent *whip* gesture as they passed us. At this point, it was obvious what was gonna happen, so everyone on call started excusing themselves to customers and told them they would call back in a few minutes, then turned curiously towards the office door.\n\n\nAbout a minute later we started hearing screaming and sounds of heavy objects being tossed around, from behind the door. The team collectively agreed they were celebrating his new promotion. Soon after, the door burst open and out marched the two policemen with our ex-coworker in cuffs. They had to drag him all the way through our office and down the stairs, while he was furiously kicking and knocking over anything he could reach on his path. The entire team started applauding as the office doors closed behind him. Our boss was standing in the doorway to his office, just lightly shaking his head in disbelief of what had just happened. Then turned his attention to the team and said \"Back to work. Pizza and beer after closing hours, is on me\".\n\n\nNeedless to say that we were all pretty stoked; not only had we gotten rid of the scourge that had plagued us (and the customers) for the past few weeks, but we also got free pizza afterwards. 5/7, would snitch again.\n\n\nTL;DR: Co-worker lies and steals from customers, leaving us to clean his mess. Gets arrested.",

        "text": "I work at a call center in the recall department of an auto manufacturer. We have a team of people, called field canvassing agents, who go door to door informing people of life-threatening safety recalls on their vehicles. They do this because a lot of our customers underestimate the urgency of the recall and take their time addressing it. As of now we've had numerous injuries and several fatalities in our vehicles, so our canvassing team has to be proactive in tracking down the owners and making sure they get to a dealership.\n\nI just got a call a few minutes ago from a woman stating that a canvassing agent had been leaving recall notices on her property, which she had recently moved into. She said the notices were addressed to a man who used to live at her address, and that the agent had also approached a guest the caller had over to ask if they were the owner of the vehicle.\n\nI apologized and explained the situation to the caller. Throughout the call, she maintained a friendly, professional demeanor with a passive-aggressive undercurrent; she kept pointing out how odd it was that one of our agents would approach a guest of hers, even after I'd already told her what was going on.\n\nI told her I'd get her over to someone who could update the information on file and ensure that she did not receive anymore notices. She declined and, speaking just as politely as she had been, said it wasn't her responsibility to make sure the information was up to date. Then she asked me to document her complaint against the agent for accosting her guest and said she'd report the agent for trespassing if it happened again, saying solicitation would not be tolerated. I said \"Well, it's not really solicitation,\" and tried to reiterate that the agent was literally trying to prevent someone's violent death, but she cut me off with \"Yes it is.\" She told me again to document the complaint and hung up on me mid-sentence while I was responding.\n\n",

They told me there was no information about that! I’m 7ft 4 and I need to know if I will fit in the cabin! \n\nM: Okay Sir, apologies etc... we update our information as best as possible however that is not something we have ever had an issue with. \n\nMy manager carry’s on and explains we’re happy to email the ship and see if it’s possible to get an estimate measurement.

After creating the account, you had a timeframe (6 months if I remember correctly) to place an order before your account being fully closed. If the account got fully closed, you could sell again by resubscribing, paying a new fee, basically a new account. \n\nSo this guy had subscribed and while waiting the week to get the welcome package in the mail, he totally forgot about the account and never placed an order until about a week after said deadline.\n\nNow, when the accounts got closed, for a time you could still access it but the only thing you could do on them was note it, and sometimes not even that. \n\nSo I get this call as a supervisor call, he had been on the phone with a regular agent for a good 5+ minutes asking to either be refunded, have his account reactivated or be given a new account for free. All three options where literally impossible for us, specially since there was no account to perform a transaction on. Sup call went like this:\n\n- Him: give me my account back!\n- Me: sorry sir, we are unable to reactivate an account that has been closed \n- H: then refund me my money\n- M: I’m sorry sir the money is for the kit you’ve already confirmed that you received so we’re unable to refund you for it \n- H: then open up a new account for me for free\n- M: sorry sir but opening a new account is a procedure handled by a completely different department and you’ll be required to pay for the account as there is no way to bypass this. (This part was after I talked to a higher up). You may then request a refund but we cannot assure you that it will be processed.\n- H: then reactivate my account!\n \n\nRinse and repeat same demands and answers for q good 10 minutes until this\n\n- H: then I’m gonna stay on the line until you either refund me or open my account\n- M: I’m sorry sir, no matter how long you stay on the line, we still cannot do any of the things you have requested, not me nor a higher up.\n- H: ok, I’ll stay on the line....\n- M: (at this point already annoyed and fully aware that we’re not a toll free number and charged as long distance) ok sir, just let me reassure you that there’s nothing we can do until a new account is opened\n- H: ok, I’ll stay on the line \n- M: ok sir\n- H: *silence*\n- M: *silence*\n\nAfter a while and some “are you still there?” From the caller, he disconnected the call after being in the line with me for nearly 20 minutes....",

This was a call related to the user's electricity bill. I just wanna clear one thing up, since electricity billing may be done differently elsewhere. Over here, an official comes and reads your meter, then makes an approximation of your monthly usage. This happens once every 6 months. This also means that after that's done, your electricity bill remains the same for the next 6 months, you could use twice as much, or not use any at all, you still need to pay the approximated amount. At each reading, the difference is noted, and if the user used more than was approximated, they pay the difference, and if it's less, we reduce their next electricity bills in equal amount. Now, this woman had her meter read 2 months before my call.\n\nM-me\nU-user\n\nM: Hello this is (name), calling about a complaint we have recieved about an electricity bill, is this Mrs. (surname)?\n\nU: Yes.\n\nM: (the call may be recorded note)\n\nU: That's fine.\n\nM: So can you please explain what exactly is the problem?\n\nU: You charge me way too much, there's no way i used that much electricity.\n\nM: I understand, however the system of payment is set, and since the approximation of your usage is 400 HRK (around 64 USD), that is the amount that will be billed every month, regardless of the amount of electricity used. The difference will be calculated at the next reading, and if it turns out you have been overcharged, we will reduce your following bills.\n\nU: But the approximation is wrong!\n\nM: I'm sorry, but we cannot change the approximation. You can either wait until the next reading or call in an extra reading, but i have to warn you that you will be billed for that.\n\nU: Sir, how could someone approximate that i use 400 HRK worth of electricity, when i used to pay 300 HRK (48 USD) when there 6 people in the house?\n\nM: The readings and approximations are done by our partner, and we do not have access to the method they use for approximating your usage. I'm sorry but i can't help you regarding your approximated usage beyond recommending to wait or call in an extra reading.\n\nU: You people are insane! When my whole family was at home, there were 6 people in the house, and we paid 300 HRK monthly! Now it' just me and my daughter, and i work in (other country), so i was only home for 2 weeks this month! You are telling me that my daughter alone spent 200HRK of electricity? She wouldn't use that much electricity if she owned a vibrator that plugs into the mains!\n\nM: *mutes headset* *proceeds to laugh balls off*\n\nU: Are you there? Answer my question!\n\nM: *unmute* I'm sorry, but i really can't help you further. If you really believe that an extra reading would help you, i can call in one for you, but the cost is 50 HRK (8 USD).\n\nU: *mumbles something* Yeah go ahead, do that.\n\nM: Done, thank you for your time and i hope this removes the cause to your dissatisfaction.\n\nU: Thank you. *hangs up*\n\nAfter that call, i giggled the rest of the day...",

        "text": "I work for a company that produces a certain medical device, and a while ago we couldn't deliver. For months. All due to the higher ups decided to bust open a new market without having a new production line ready. Thing is that the company already has a contract with the health care system in my country, and people get these things as a kind of life aid.\n\n\n\nSo, tens of thousands of people with a chronic illness are not getting the help the have a right to, and I represent the company whose fault it is. You see where this is going, right?\n\n\n\nOn top of taking about four times as many calls as we had the capacity for, we also were not allowed to tell the customers that we were out of stock, just that we had delays (which isn't holding up when someone is calling in for the fifth week in a row). No idea why, but that's how it was.* It was absolute hell.\n\n\n\nI have a lot of stories from this period, but there are two that stand out in my mind.\n\n\n\nMe: Opening spiel\n\nCustomer: Am I speaking with a person?\n\nM: I'm sorry?\n\nC: Am I talking to a robot or a real person?\n\nMy first thought was \"I'm not even sure anymore\", but that's not what I said. I think it was the way we turned into monotonous automatons from taking the same call a hundred times a day, and the recorded message he heard before the call that made him unsure, but it was still the most interesting question I've gotten. \n\n\n\nThe other story was someone calling at the end of the day just sounding desperate. The call started out just like all the other calls, and then developed into the conversation below.\n\nM: Sorry, we have a problem with shipping at the moment, and the delays are a consequence of that. There is nothing I can do.\n\nC: I really need it. Can't you make an exception?\n\nM: I can't. If I could, maybe, but at the moment no one is getting their product.\n\nC: I called in. I understand that people are waiting for their stuff, but if one is calling in perhaps that shows that one is in need.\n\nM (with a somewhat less pleasant tone, possibly even sounding offended): To be frank, C, but I have taken this exact call at least 70 times just today, and hundreds of times this week. You are not the only one who is desperate, and far from the only one calling in. I know it's hard, but there is nothing we can do for anyone, even though we want to. You will just have to wait until we can deliver, just like everyone else. \n\nC: Oh. Okay. Thanks for your time.\n\n\n\nNow, I get the guy. Calling customer service is a last resort for many people, me included, and they often know nothing about our lives on the other end of the call. In the moment I was just shocked by the sheer audacity of thinking he was the only one with this problem, that him calling in should grant him a special treatment.\n\n\n\nAt least it's over now, and somehow I survived. Still looking forward to having my last day in that hellish place this August.\n\n\n\n*I did anyway, just a week or so into it. At first a bit hush-hush, looking around to make sure the manager didn't hear me, but gradually getting less and less careful, and finally just telling just about everyone all about it, why it came to be this way, and that we should be happy that they even pay our salary (which was another problem we had about a year back, but that's another story). By then everyone was so tired that no one cared, and I've never heard a word about it from anyone in management. ",

        "text": "**A little bit of context before I get into it**: I’m a Tier 2 Agent for a smart home tech company that makes various products; including a thermostat, which we have two versions of. As tier 2, when we leave cases open for whatever reason, we are supposed to follow up with the customer.\n\nSo this happened a couple days ago around the beginning of my shift. I had some callbacks scheduled and was getting through them fairly easily. Next on my list of callbacks was Mr. G (to avoid sharing any personal info), who I had helped troubleshoot his thermostat a couple weeks ago, and we determined that he’d need to have a common wire installed to resolve the issue that he was experiencing; which was his HVAC was short cycling due to how the thermostat tries to charge itself. I told him I’d reimburse the cost of a tech visit to get it installed; which he did, and sent me the invoice for the tech visit, hence the callback.\n\nI call Mr. G and he answers and I do my standard greeting of “Hello, this is HayDumGee2911 (obviously not my real name) with ________ senior Support. I’m calling to follow up with you on x, y, z; and to make sure the issue has been resolved.” \n\n“Oh yes,” said Mr. G, “Thank you for following up with me. Actually, the thermostat is still giving the low battery message on a daily basis.”\n\n“Wait a minute, just to confirm this is for your Thermostat x?” I asked; at this point, I’m confused because a common wire, if installed correctly, and would maintain a consistent charge on the thermostat.\n\n“No, this is for my thermostat s,” he replies, “I’ve never had any issues with my thermostat x before. It’s always ran wonderfully.”\n\nI fall silent for a moment as I start reviewing the case notes and the troubleshooting that was tried; as well as the serial number of the thermostat. “Can you confirm the serial number of the thermostat you’re running into a battery issue with?”\n\n“Yeah absolutely. It’s _________”; he replies. The serial number he provided didn’t match what we had on his account; so I thought perhaps he never had it registered to his account, no big deal.\n\nWe do some troubleshooting, and find that the issue is his thermostat’s battery; so I’ll have to send him a replacement. After gathering a shipping address and giving him some info, I let him go; and begin finishing up some casework while in after call work.\n\nWhen I went to enter the serial number to file a warranty replacement, it tells me that it’s registered to another account; which shouldn’t be right since it’s not on his account. I search the serial number in our system, and sure enough, it’s on someone else’s account; same name, same phone number, but different emails.\n\nI think to myself, *Alright, perhaps he has two accounts set up then,* and take another look at the invoice that I received from the customer; and that’s when I notice the address. On the first email, which the thermostat x was registered under, it’s listed as a Nebraska address and that’s what’s listed on the invoice; but for the other email, where the thermostat s (and a second thermostat s) is registered under, it’s listed as a Florida address and that’s what I was given for where to ship the replacement. Additionally, both emails only have one case in record, and on both agents notes in the cases, the information they recorded matched what was on file for the respected accounts.\n\nI’m dumbfounded. How can the customer be in Florida, but got work done in Nebraska; and even more importantly, how could he not remember that? Perhaps the information I was told was confirmed was incorrect when I originally took the call a couple weeks back wasn’t actually correct, or perhaps something deeper was going on.\n\nOne of my coworkers suggested I reply to the email that sent the invoice and ask for a good callback number to discuss reimbursement for the tech visit. I didn’t hear anything back until yesterday; where the customer replied, and it was a different call back number than what was listed on both accounts. I wasn’t able to call them back yesterday, but when I go back to work Thursday, I’m confident it’s going to be a different customer that shares the same name; but part of me is concerned it’s the same customer; and doesn’t remember the HVAC work.\n\nTL;DR: Helped a customer with their thermostat x, and after they got work done I called to follow up with them; the customer claims to not have gotten that work done and never ran into issues with their thermostat x. Found an issue with their thermostat s, went to set up a replacement and found that there are two accounts that share the same name and phone number; but different emails and addresses. Replied to the email to get a good callback number, and got a different one than what was on file; have yet to follow up to that number. Either a different customer with the same name; or something strange is going on.\n\nSTL;SDR: Customer got work done. Called to confirm, they claimed it never happened. After helping with a new issue, found conflicting information. Got a new phone number, still need to follow up. Probably different customer, but possibly twilight zone.\n\nEdit/Update: So I know I said I’d update yesterday when I went in to work, but I ended up calling in yesterday. Today, I called the number from that email reply in regards to the invoice, and it was a different customer; oddly enough the two sound similar. This customer confirmed that he only had the one NTE and he’s in Nebraska. So the mystery was solved. Someone listed the callback number for the other customer as this one who shared the same name. Updated the phone number and went ahead and moved forward with a solution.",

        "text": "Hi, long time lurker, first time poster.\n\nPrior to moving into Workforce Management 2 years ago at the same call centre, I was a sales and service rep. The company is STV and ISP company.\n\nI had lady call up who was very irritated about her bill history and the charges on said bill. This call should have gone to our outsourced billing team, however our customers know how to jig the IVR to speak to my department who are primarily based in house. Our billing teams are extremely good at their job, but I guess customers prefer to talk to someone in the same country. Anyway, this was more or less our conversation paraphrased, minus the profanity and racial slurs. \n\nMe: introduct-\n\nCust: are you *based in country of company?\n\nMe: yes, west of *Capital city. You're speaking with yippiekiyia, how can-\n\nCust: you're the fourth person I've spoken to and if you don't fix this issue I'm going to talk to all the news outlets and go to the ombudsman.\n\nMe: I'm here to help. May I start with asking a few questions so I have all your account details ready?\n\nDoes all the account verification. And during the usual small talk about systems being slow I quickly suss the account and two things stand out. Large amount owing on the account and account suspension.\n\nMe: so I can see you've spoken to us a few times regarding your bill. Is there something unresolved I can help with?\n\nCust: I've been speaking to numerous agents and no one can help. Your company is stealing from me and no one can give me a straight answer.\n\nMe: okay, so have you been over charged, I'm happy to walk through the last few bills to check for any discrepancies. Have you made any changes to your service recently?\n\nCust: no that's not it. I spoke to a lady a week ago who said my account was all paid up. But my TV isn't working, and I have a bill that says I'm $200 (I think) in debt!\n\nAs she's telling me this I check the notes, and she did speak to someone. I can't remember what the notes read, but it was something along the lines of that the customers current months charges were paid. And that they had waived a late payment fee. So I guess the agent just advised the customer of the minimum amount required to continue using the service and the customer took this as being all paid up. \n\nOur system has a little feature that basically colour codes each past month depending on whether a bill has been paid on time, is late or has entered collections process. This customer has been 1 cycle off debt referral for at least 11 months. How this happens I couldn't even comprehend. Invoices and billing info is kept on file for 12 months or so, then we need to use am archive system to retrieve older info. \n\nI ask the customer a few questions, place them on hold and work through the charges. I go back to her every few minutes to ask more questions and all the charges are legit. Nothing out of the ordinary. There are however late payment fees on every bill which also makes sense. A few had been waved as per notes.\n\nMe: so everything checks out, the charges are correct yet you are behind in your bill. No payments have bounced... You don't pay via direct debit so do you pay at a post office or something?\n\nCust: no I Bpay at the end of the month once I know I've received the service.\n\nMe: sorry, did you say you pay at the end of the month? Do you mean the billing month?\n\nCust: yes. Im billed on the first, so I wait till the end of the month to pay because I don't want to pay your company any money until I know I've received the service.\n\nMe: how long have you been doing this?\n\nCust: three years.\n\nMe: okay... So I know what's happened here. So you've been paying off the invoice at the end of each month, basically a day before you receive your next invoice?\n\nCust: no, when I receive the next bill. I won't pay for a service until I get the full months service. And I don't pay the late fees because I refuse to pay for something until I've received it.\n\nMe: and after three years, you would become more and mor behind and rack up a lot of fees.\n\nCust: like I said, I'm not paying it.\n\nThe remaining 20minutes is me trying to reassure that whatever initial billing dispute she had in the past, our process and tools have improved greatly to prevent and correct disputes if they should rarely occur.\n\nThat's the story of a woman who wouldn't accept that our service is prepaid and this would continue forever...

This is what went on during the call i made to the customer to explain the decision about the resolution of his complaint. Anyways, i'll get to it.\n\n\nI read up on the info given during the complaint call, it's a problem with the 2 MyKi watches (a \"smart\" watch that's actually used to spy on your kids), and the end user claims that they are defective, straight from the shop. I run the usual diagnostics, to check if the devices are connected to the network, and everything checks out fine. So i give the customer a call.\n\nMe: Hello, this is (my name) calling from (my company) about a complaint we recieved, is this Mr. (surname)?\n\nUser: Yes it is, about damn time.\n\nMe: Okay, before we begin the conversation, i would just like to notify you that this call may be recorded for training and quality improvement purposes, is this okay with you?\n\nUser: Yeah whatever.\n\nMe: Okay, can you please describe your issue, since in your complaint you only mentioned the units are defective?\n\nUser: That's exactly what my complaint is about.\n\nMe: Okay, i have a feeling we didn't understand each other very well, what i meant to ask you is what makes you think the units are defective?\n\nUser: The GPS doesn't work, you retard!\n\nMe: Please calm down, i cannot help you with your issue unless you give me a more detailed description of the fault. Is the unit unable to connect  to the network, or is just the GPS feature not working?\n\nUser: The GPS feature is clearly not working to the specifications you have listed.\n\nMe: Okay, can you please explain which specification are you referring to?\n\nUser: You claim the GPS location is accurate to 10 meters, which is not the case with my units.\n\nMe: Okay, the specifications listed on the site and in the stores come directly from the manufacturer, and we do not alter them.\n\nUser: Well then please explain to me how can the unit that's currently on my 9 year old daughter's wrist show her location to be 100 meters away in a field, but she's sitting right beside me?\n\nMe: That is a perfectly normal occurence, different areas have varying GPS coverage during different times, and GPS doesn't preform very well indoors. The listed 10 meters refers to the best accuracy, under ideal conditions.\n\nUser: Okay, that might explain the first unit, but the second one has to be defective.\n\nMe: Okay, does it have the same issue?\n\nUser: No, this one is even worse, and it belongs to my 19 year old son.\n\nMe: Okay, can you please describe the issue in more detail, and if possible give us the time and date when the issue appeared?\n\nUser: Last friday was a good example, i was on a business trip outside the country, and i called my son to check up on him when i got to.my hotel, around 9:30 PM, maybe a bit later. I asked where he is and what's he doing, and he told me he was just down the street at a friend's place, playing videogames. So why did your damn watch tell me he was 6 kilometers away, in a town?\n\nMe: Well, can you verify that your son was indeed at that friend's house?\n\nUser: Obviously no, because your damn watch isn't working.\n\nMe: Okay, but have you considered the possibility of him not telling the truth?\n\nUser: Absolutely not, i didn't raise a liar!\n\nMe: Okay, if you believe that the units are defective, you can turn them in for repair at our nearest center at (location).\n\nUser: But sir, i don't think you understand, they cannot be fixed, they are defective straight from the factory! They need to be replaced with ones from a different batch!\n\nMe: Okay, our service crew will inspect your units and repair or replace them accordingly. If a batch is found to be defective, they will of course be replaced.\n\nUser: Okay, and do i get replacement units while they are being serviced?\n\nMe: I'm sorry sir, but we do not currently offer replacements for this product.\n\nUser: Then please explain to me, how am i supposed to secure my children without the watches? When i saw my daughter wasn't in the school, but rather around 100 meters away, i had no choice but to call the police! Will your company cover the expenses of hiring someone to make sure my children are okay?\n\nMe: I recommend you use whatever methods you used before you bought these devices. I'm sorry, but we can't help you with anything that's not our service or units.\n\nUser: I will see you in court, you violated (i wont quote, because i don't remember exactly what laws he stated, but something about children's rights and human rights), this will be a nation-wide incident, if not world-wide!\n\nMe: I am very sorry you feel that way, but i still cannot help you further. The best we can do is to have the units inspected and repaired or replaced, as needed.\n\nUser: Okay, i would like to know who i'm speaking to!\n\nMe: As i told you at the start of our conversation, my name is (my name) and i'm calling about your complaint, from the complaint department.\n\nUser: And how would that distinguish you from any other employee with the same name?\n\nMe: It's clearly visible that i called you, under my own name, with a time and date. No other agent is talking with you at this exact time, correct?\n\nUser: Okay, enjoy being fired retard!\n\nMe: Okay, thank you for your time and have a nice day.\n\nThe user hung up at this point.\n\nThis is probably the first time i was left speechless after a conversation. I went to take a break because i could not believe what i just heard. He later submitted a written complaint, which was denied with the same explanation i gave him, but he also wrote that i was harrassing him and that he believes that i didn't want to solve his problem. Needless to say, our supervisor had the call recorded, so i could prove i was not harrassing him. What puzzled me the most is what kind of parent do you have to be to make your son who is legally an adult, (18 is the legal drinking, smoking, gambling, porn and driving age here) wear what is essentially spying gear on his wrist. Oh and it senses when you take it off for bonus points. Now i know some parents will think that he's completely right, but even my coworkers who are parents were stunned, and some even called him mentally ill. Personally, i'd like to meet the guy and ask him to let his children off the chain. Literally.\n\nEDIT: Lemme know if you guys mind stories from complaint management, because i have  a few more i can share, but idk if that's okay with you guys and girls.",

Starts in on a tirade about how he pays his bill every month and how \"you people\" don't fulfill their end of the contract.  I pull up the account. First thing I see is a nonpay suspension.  I can't tell him this without verifying.  \n\nme:\"Can you verify the date of birth on the account, Sir?\"\n\nCX: \"Well whose is it!?\"\n\nme: I can't share that information without verifying the account, but you can give me yours and we'll see if that works\n\n*5 minute tirade about how he pays his bill and how I'm refusing to fix his internet*\n\nme: Sir, I'm not refusing to fix anything, but for what this issue is, I need to verify before I can share any information.\n\nCX: it's DOB.\n\nme: Alright that's it, So, from what I'm seeing, you're currently suspended for not paying your bill.\n\nCX: Why are you trying not to do your job, your company isn't fulfilling your end of the contract!\n\nme: No Sir, the issue is that you're not because you didn't pay your bill.\n\nCX: well what can you do to FIX IT?!\n\nme: I can get you to collections to pay your bill\n\nCX: So you're refusing to fix it?\n\nme: I'm tech support.

        "text": "So I work at a financial company call center and my role specifically deals with complex tax stuff. Over the past six months I’ve had a string of bad surveys and nasty comments. I used to use the typical girly sweet “phone voice” but my manager said that I came off as disingenuous, condescending and bitchy (I’m a female) so then I tried to just be myself which I am pretty blunt and straightforward and that didn’t help either. Sometimes I do get frustrated on the phones when I’ve explained a concept 10 times or when a customer is immediately shitty for no reason (pretty sure that’s something all reps go through) but I’ve really been working at it. I absolutely hate working on the phones however my job pays great with great benefits. I’m starting to think I just don’t have what it takes to work on the phones...\n\nDoes any phone people have any advice on how they handled shitty surveys and/or feedback? ",

        "text": "This will be a short one.\n\n**Background:**\n\nA few years back I worked as a L1 support for a phone company. Horrible job. This is one of the stories that stuck with me.\n\n**Story:**\n\nIt was around noon when $C [customer] called. He had heard about our offer where he could call *one* other phone number for free. As such, he had bought that service.\n\n\nThe customer is required to log in to their account and input the number manually, after which it will be free to call that number, as long as you hang up before the 2 hour mark. Calling the same number, within seconds of hanging up, was allowed.\n\n\nThe issue $C had, was that he was getting billed for calling this number and he wanted to know why. I quickly recalled the 2 hour rule and went to check; all of his calls were less than 2 hours. Good boy. So I went to check the number he had provided for the service. Guess what, the last numeral was wrong. I told him this. He refuted having made a mistake and demanded a full refund. I told him I could see in the logs, down to the exact second, when he input the number and his IP at that time.\n\n\nHis reaction? Blaming me (personally) for changing the number after he had input it, because he knew he didn't make a mistake. I told him that even if I sympathized with him, the amount he demanded refunded was way above what I was allowed to refund, so I couldn't refund him even if I wanted to.\n\n\nThis unleashed another storm of slurs and personal critique; something along the lines of being a liar, corrupt, incompetent, etc.\n\nLuckily, the company policy allowed us to hang up on customer if they verbally attack us, so I did.\n\n**-CLICK-**\n\nTL;DR: Guy got billed for a mistake he made, then blames me for it.",
