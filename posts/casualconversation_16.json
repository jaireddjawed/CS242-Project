        "text": "I believe there are secrets in life. These secrets will help you become successful at living well, and thus being successful at life. Secrets are truths that people deny, dismiss, or reject -- because they believe they know better, when they actually don't. If you don't know the secrets to living well, I think it is very difficult to live well. \n\nI observe that many people who don't live well are keen on telling others that they are wrong. You might observe this on reddit -- scroll down the comments section and count how many negative comments there are before there is one that isn't negative. People who live well, they keep such secrets they've discovered to themselves. \n\nI have a BA in philosophy, and I believe philosophy is about wisdom and truth. But contemporary, analytic, western philosophy -- whatever you want to call it -- is more about strange arguments about weird things that lack practical value. Arguing about things that have no practical value is impractical and not obvious how they are in anyway useful to living.\n\nThe secrets that pertain to wisdom and living well have been rejected in part due to the counter-culture that emerged in the English speaking world several decades ago -- possibly centuries ago. I grew up with the idea that: you don't know that, that's not necessarily true, you're wrong!\n\nDevelopments that emerged from this counter-culture created a morale and set of morals about what is right and righteous, often believed with great conviction and certainty in modernity, but on a historical timescale, they are experimentations that we live through socially and culturally. \n\nDo I live well? Yes. I have meaningful work and meaningful relationships. If there was any kind of work in the world that I'd do, it's what I'm doing now. What I do now, I created for myself to do, and it's quite enjoyable and lucrative. And the people that I have relationships with are very endearing and enduring to me, and everyone that I have a meaningful relationship with also has a meaningful relationship with each other.",

Puts her two cents in when she should stay quiet basically.  My Mother has spoken to my brother about this so he can get a handle on it before it‚Äôs too late.  She also stares at the imperfections I have depending on how I look in the comfort of my home that day and has done this with my Mother too.  It‚Äôs actually really rude.

I know it could be something in his personal life, but a small part of me makes me feels like hes getting sick of me because I go there everyday. But then again he does keep up with what we usually do when we see each other: because its a small but crowded shop and queues are always long, the staff dont put your goods in a plastic bag. You do it yourself outside. But hed always pack mine in for me. We'd also greet each other and would fist bump each other before I leave.\n\nI feel like I should stop going there for a while in case hes tired of me, but then again it could be something in his personal life.

So please if you have any judgements keep it to yourself thank you :)\n\nI got a random DM from someone but I assumed it was a spam account, so I ignored it. Curiosity got the best of me and a few minutes later I opened the message. It was pictures but the pics were blurred unless I accepted the message so I did. Then I see my cat!! I wish you all knew what I felt when I saw how big she'd gotten and how chunky lol. The lady I texted first never responded but she did see my message obvi bc the new DM I got was from Jane, who mentioned that I reached out to their friend.\n\nJane updated me on her (the cat) and explained the whole thing, told me she didn't know the cat belonged to me. Jane told me about how sweet she was, and I knew even after seeing her pictures that it was her. She told me she didn't want to give her (the cat) up since she's been with her for over a year and I thought I'd have a problem with that but after thinking about it, I wasn't mad about it. She's healthy, cared for, loved, fed, has a best friend with who had it rough and they're close now. I wouldn't feel right taking her out her new home when she's happy and comfortable.\n\nOn top of that I have a female cat home with me, and I don't know if I would be able to afford to care for another cat. Jane sends me updates on my little gal and sometimes I ask for updates myself. And since some people in the last post mentioned that there's a possibility it wasn't my cat (even tho I 1000% knew), when I asked Jane what she calls the cat now, Jane responded with the name of the street I live on :D so yeah, it's my little gal. I'll always call her mine bc she was my first cat, and I can't see myself not calling her mine. Thanks for reading haha\n\nTLDR- I found the person who has my cat and decided to let them keep it. I get updates &amp; pics of her and that works for me",

        "text": "Hello there! I wnated to talk about my uncle's amateur baseball club, who competes in tournaments across canada and the United states, with the last 2 year seeing trips to europe, as well!\n\nThe club was created in 1995 by my uncle and some friends and business partners of him. Since the creation of the club, we won the canadian championship two times (2002, 2017), the Pif Classic (the biggest tournament in Quebec) 2 times as well (2008, 2014) and we reached the Firecracker final in 2017 in Hartford, Connecticut. My grandpa also won the Pif in 1977, and in his only participation in the canadian championship,they lost in the semi-finals to the eventual champions.\n\n\nThis year is sort of a changing of the guard, as my Uncle has signed some ypunger players, especially in the outfield, to lead the team onwards, along with our starting 3rd baseman retiring due to knee issues, which will lead to an intra-team competition for the 3rd base spot.\n\nTraining camp will start soon in Florida. In the past few years, the club did their training camp at the Dominican Republic, but this year, they're going to Florida instead. Probably because it costs less and you can travek by bus instead of paying for expensive plane tickets.\n\nWe currently have two pitchers on our rotation, which is fine for amateur standards, but i can't help but feel that a 3rd pitcher would do wonders for us. Maybe our long-standing left fielder could become a 3rd pitcher for us. He's old, now, and he doesn't have the legs needed to olay in the outfiled, but he always had a heck of an arm, so maybe converting hin to our 3rd pitcher might be a good and cost-effective idea...\n\nAnyways, if ya want any info on the club or anything related to that, AMA!",

I honestly say that I wanted to find someone because I'm the type of person that I want to share my life with someone else, not because I need someone or can't be one, but because I'd see it as an opportunity to give someone a share of my wonderful life. But anyways, after more negatives than positives and obviously living being single than anything, I've learned about myself that I love my peace and love my current lifestyle, my schedule, what I do and don't do. I can't see myself allowing anyone telling me what to do, or how to do it, wasting energy on what could be toxic or a two face person, I just can't. Inahve planned out so much for my near and far future that I think I'm on a level that not just anyone can come in and be on it. When you find peace while being alone, you're values and self love are so valuito you that you have no room for haggle towards anyone.",

        "text": "Hey, hope your having a good day/night :)\n\nAs a man, I haven't found that much luck on dating apps a few years ago. And I haven't heard they've gotten any better since. My main problem is that I like being at home and tend to stay quiet in group conversations. So where could I find myself a lifelong partner? I honestly don't mind the distance, but it's harder to filter out from a worldwide amount of people. And harder to get to know someone as well. Though I believe you can find someone more compatible if you don't mind the distance the question is mostly how. Would be nice with an omniscient being that knew the best possible outcome for everyone and matched everyone optimally. Of course people would still lose out, but on average it would be heaven.\n\nSo anyways, any advice on what I work on myself. Secondly where I can find partners. And third how to get to know people better/faster. Video games are horrible for finding partners though I'd love to do it that way. Online dating is horrible for many reasons, but I might have to reinstall. Would love to hear any alternatives though. Should I go with a sign that says I'm single feel free to talk to me? I'd wager no, because it would seem insecure, and I would be too shy to do it anyways. Happy to dicuss anything related as well",
