        "text": "I was going to make this an ask reddit, but I felt I might need to explain what it was, along with a bit of a rant about how ridiculous some peoples seemed to be.  \n\nSo for starters I was talking with some co-workers about community service, and it just reminded me of the senior project I had to do to graduate high school a few years back.  There was the main option of completing and documenting the project.  Or just doing 16 hours of community service.  There were several meeting with an advisor through the year for it to be approved and make sure you were making progress then you had to present it in-front of a group of teachers at the end of the year when completed.\n\nIt felt a little excessive at first, only because of the projects me and several friends chose.  I organized and did most of the leg work for a food drive.  Some of my friends organized and took the lead on habitat for humanity type projects.  The project itself didn't have to be community service related, one friend built a deck on his house, another restored a classic car.   But later I was a bit shocked when I found out some people did ones as simple as painting a wall, or organizing their bed room.   \n\nIn hind sight this makes me thing the whole thing was about learning to document and present things instead of completing anything meaningful.   \n\nThe worst part of this is I know people who didn't bother to even do a simple project and didn't graduate on time, or at all, just because of that.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/11422zj/notetaking_has_been_the_singlemost_useful_tool/",
        "text": "I've always had a very difficult time focusing. I think that it was an instinctive thing to have relied on notetaking during my adolescence. I was obsessed. I took notes for schoolwork, groceries, or something I wanted to do even 10 minutes later. Notetaking, for me, was more than just a way of memorizing things for school. It was my life support. Without it, I wouldn't be able to function as a proper human being. I'd forget everything, do everything too late, and never be in the moment. One thought would jump to the next, and I'd never... be *here*; I'd always be *there*. But, as the stressors of adulthood started to take ahold of me, I'd forgotten why notetaking was so important for me, so I'd eventually put the pen down, close my notebook, and make any kind of excuse to stop taking notes.\n\nI'll be honest: as great a tool notetaking is for me, it can be a big pain in the ass. I'm slow with everything because I can't just read, listen, or watch something. If I want to engage with what's in front of me, I have to pause in the moment and take a quick note. Notetaking - that is, handwritten notetaking, not typing on a computer or phone - lets me interact with the information I'm working with and helps me to *focus* and *be in the moment*, the two things that are nearly impossible to do when you have ADD. But I'm a slow writer, and I'm getting slower with age. I didn't have the leeway to be a slow person as a working adult. Everything is on a time crunch, and the only saving grace for me was coffee. But, by a sheer stroke of luck, everything eventually changed for me about a month ago.\n\nDuring one of my meetings for work, I was taking notes, as it happened to be quite an important one, and, when the speaker asked me a question, I was able to give a proper answer, rather than say something like, \"Oh, sorry, can you repeat the question?\" or \"Sorry, I spaced off for a bit. I'm not too sure\". It clicked with me immediately: \"Holy shit, I actually answered the question without some sort of hiccup\".\n\nSince then, for the first time in years, I've been able to do things on a much more consistent basis. It's improved my relationships with people and my confidence in myself. It's improved my performance at work. It's added so much order to the chaos I'd been living through for *years* because I created excuses to stop taking notes. It's a small thing. Just one small thing. Just taking notes. But I write down almost everything I feel is necessary, into my special little notebook, and that one small thing has made me so much happier. Sure, it can be a pain to have to write things down at times, and, sometimes, I end up writing so much that my hand hurts, but I now know that it's worth it.\n\nIf anybody reading this has ADD and you've never tried notetaking, please try it. The worse that can happen is that it ends up not working out, and the best thing is that it could change your life, and isn't something that can change your life worth trying out, even a little bit?\n\nThank you for reading this super long post. I've just been so overjoyed lately and wanted to share it here. Cheers, everyone.",

All classrooms here have a small storage area on the back, which is usually never used, but I had never seen how they were from the inside. Since there was no one, I just entered and sat there, finding out that it's nothing more than an empty, dusty, minuscule space that barely allows to sit down.\n\nWell, immediately after I sat, some woman entered the classroom. I figured she'd go away soon, si instead of saying anything and scaring the shit out of the poor girl I decided to wait.\n\nWell, my bag, with all my stuff, is still in a chair on the classroom, but the owner is nowhere to be seen. Because he's hiding in that small storage area, with his butt hurting due to the uncomfortable position he has to sit in as to not draw attention, because now there's like 15 people in the classroom and it'll be extremely awkward and creepy if I randomly got out after so long. It's been like 2 hours lmao.\n\nGuess all I can do is hope no one notices me here and wait until everyone is out. Hopefully that'll happen in less than an hour. Wish me luck.",

I admit it was my fault as I wasn’t paying attention but someone could’ve easily opened the door. \n\nAnother story is I remember watching America’s Most Wanted years ago and a woman was being chased by a predator. She was running around screaming for help and everyone just ignored her. The guy ended up shooting her. \n\nOne last story is a woman got robbed at a convenience store. The robber punched her in the face and broke her nose. Her nose is bleeding badly. Another customer walks in and just places his merchandise on the counter. He never even asked why she had a bloody nose or why a criminal was cleaning out the register.\n\nI know technically nobody is obligated to help but I’ve seen too many situations where someone could be a Good Samaritan and they just ignore it.",

We couldn't go out of our home for weeks and months. We couldn't go to work. We couldn't go to school. Couples couldn't marry. Millions of women got birth alone and millions of people got lonely and quick funerals. Many of us couldn't seen beloved relatives and friend for 2 years.  We lived in the costant fear to get really sick or die or to lose our loved ones if like me you are healthy and young. According to WHO almost 15 million of people died.

You can design a full game withen months and without spending a dollar, but marketing is really a different story.\n\nFor marketing you need website, email (and thousands of positive emails to contact them), accounts in all famous social medias (and thousands of people interested in games to contact them), SEOs, influencers, YouTube and youtubers, Switch (and lot of friends and contacts),  and more and more, it never ends.\n\nTo do that also you should have a good budget. Because it is not easy, anything you want to do you just have to pay for it, and then there is no problem at all.\n\nI searched for Funding companies, there are so many, but they can help you if you are living in US, CANADA, EUROPE. God bless these countries. I wish I am American or living there. \n\nBut, What about others who live out side, there are no founding companies neither people, so that my project dream is just a project of fail. Unless there is someone can help. I wish there is.\n\nI never despair, I'll keep searching, and learning. It is just a little bit harder for my age of 52.\n\nDon't worry,, I'll keep in touch and let you know what happens 🙂",

And that's not exclusive to garage rock. For example, \"Charmless Man\" by Blur is diffirent shades of red and \"Lola\" by the Kinks is dark blue and bright yellow. Sometimes, other sensations come into play e.g., when I hear \"Some Might Say\" by Oasis, it's like I'm staring at clear water. Oasis is the only band that makes me feel that way. There're almost no colours in their music, but it's still not boring. On the contrary, it's very refreshing. And, well, I guess I should mention that I don't literally see all that when I hear music. It's more like very strong intrusive associations.\n\nSo, how's about you? What's something special about your perception of music?",

For me, I was already going through some mental health issues, and I just became more withdrawn after. Like, going outside became even more insurmountable of a task. I used to be talkative but I slowly was unable to sustain online conversations so I just held off on having them entirely. Now whenever I try to talk to others, especially if it's a big group chat, it's really hard and I don't know how to respond and involve myself with the rest of the group. No posts either because any self expression feels weird.\n\nI'm a bit better with that now as shown by my audacity to actually post here nyehehehe. Baby steps. But I always thought it was a /me/ problem because I already had mental health issues beforehand which factored in. It was only until another friend of mine apologized in a small friend group chat for not participating much. He said that ever since the pandemic he feels like he's become much slower in processing what people say and that it feels like there's a rock in his brain preventing him from formulating something to respond. It was an \"Oh no, not you too!\" moment for me and got me thinking.\n\nMe and my friend were negative examples sadly, but what was your experience? Did you encounter the same issues as us or something else? Or did you manage to adapt somehow? Like maybe pandemic got you finding new ways to connect and trying out fun stuff even with all the new physical and distance barriers separating us. What ways have you changed (good or bad) and how will that affect any future interactions going forward?",

        "text": "I have a crush on an online friend with whom I have been talking since June 2022. I had feelings for him since then. The problem is I deliberately tried to be closer to him(as a friend). I felt quite lonely at that time and ranted a lot about how I don't have many friends(online and irl) and all those things. Every time the rant ended with me asking him whether he considered me a close friend or not. I was too stupid to ask this when we had just started talking. Couldnt realise it back then. In the beginning 2 3 months, he used to say that I am a good friend, not close. He said he feels comfortable in opening up or sharing things with me but that I have too many expectations from him. He is also generally a late replier. He told he replies late to his irl friends too. I used to fight with him over this thing and asked a lot whether late replies meant he was not interested in talking to me. He used to deny. Also he replies on time whenever I need some help or advice. Just because I wanted him to be closer to me, I even used to ask what kind of bonding he had with his other online friends, how much he texted them, etc. I admit i was quite insecure and asked such questions often which frustrated him. At that time, he was in a rough phase too, had his entrance exams around the corner etc He meets his other online friends who lives in the same city as him and apparently feels closer to them which hurts me. Now the problem is he considers me a close friend but says not as close as his other friends because maybe I keep questioning every small freaking thing i guess and deliberately rushed things. I haven't asked him about it since 3 months as I do think it will ruin our friendship completely now. Right now, we do keep talking normally often as there is an ongoing convo on an app since the beginning, idk how close he feels to me. What do you guys think about this? Any advice? Does he not feel close to me because I pushed closeness on him and asked way too many questions?",

I remember just gushing my feelings to her; she sat beside me and encouraged me to let everything out. I asked for her number, and she gave it to me and told me that we would meet in the future - I had told her about how I just wanted to meet her in the future, and I wasn't ready for a relationship now. We continued to see each other for a couple more sessions, and supposedly it wasn't allowed according to the patient-therapist ethics rules. I remember we both continued to flirt, and she told me during my last session when I explained how I couldn't look into her eyes and my heart was thumping, she turned around and started giggling and said, \"omg, I have so much control over you.\" I don't know what's happening because she recently is on a one-month vacation with her partner.

        "text": "So I had this idea for an invention… Well, maybe invention is too strong of a word, so let’s call it a product. It’s something I could easily make and sell on Etsy, that sort of thing. \n\nThe problem is that it’s the sort of thing that Adam &amp; Eve dot com might sell, so I have no idea how to go about discussing it with anyone. And to further complicate matters, this particular product is geared very much towards women, and I am a man. So, while I think it’s an awesome idea, I can’t do any testing or anything myself to refine and improve the idea. \n\nSo yeah, I’m just stuck her wondering about it. Kind of bummed about not knowing what to do next. \n\nAnyway… at least my local sports team is winning atm.",

        "text": "I got hired on with no experience, CEO offered me the company car to get to and from work if I didn't already have one, get half days every Friday (because CEO listened to everyone saying nothing happens on Fridays and still get paid full hours, get holidays off that aren't the usual big ones, get paid well for my standards, and people actually listen to my input and implement it if it makes sense.\n\nI never thought I'd find an opportunity like this and for once in my 17 years of working I don't hate going to work. I hope you all catch the lucky break I did. First time working for a small company and it really makes me feel like I wanna do my best. I feel like the luckiest person in the world. I went from $30-40k jobs my whole life to now making $70k. It feels like all my hard work has finally paid off. I know I'm lucky, but I hope everyone can have something like this because I just feel so much lighter.",

        "text": "My friend has been working on writing a book and recently decided to let me read a rough draft of it. I finished reading it and certain characters are distinctly... me. Like their mannerisms, personalities, the way they talk. I mean it makes sense I guess, we talk a lot so it's natural the things they say sound exactly like the way I say things.\n\nIdk if it's intentional or not though and I'm afraid to ask if it makes things awkward. I'm personally touched and think it's really cool but scared I'm looking to far into things and am maybe being a bit narcissistic.\n\nI can also see the author's personality in other characters but some of those characters become  villains so I imagine making a connection would come across as insulting or awkward.",
