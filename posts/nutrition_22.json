I am learning about nutrition and the subject of dietary induced thermogenesis just came up in the material. It is only briefly mentioned, but I would like to check if I understood it correctly. \n\nThe way I understood it is that about 25% of protein, 6% of carbohydrates and 4% of fats is burned off to fuel the processing of those nutrients. So lets say one consumes a diet of 100% protëin (considering such a thing would be possible), would they need to eat way more of it compared to a diet of carbohydrates or fats to compensate for the additional 19-21% that is burned off? Or am I saying something completely crazy there and perhaps misunderstand the whole thing?",
