Nevermind the ridiculousness of the request I obliged to look at it and see what I could do, and I found this gem.  Note:  This is a VC++6 project.\n\n    #define ALL_NINES 9.999999\n\nI wondered why you would possibly have to define a macro for such a number, so I searched around the project to find the ways it was used:\n\n     if(temp2 != 0.0)       // Don't allow division by zero.\n      *dSlope = temp1 / temp2;\n     else\n       *dSlope = ALL_NINES;  // Flag it.\n\nApparently ALL_NINES is used to flag errors in arithmetic.  I'd like to imagine they would have a better way to deal with such errors, but such are the ways of old programmers.",

        "text": "At a former employer, a team was formed of some of the coders from other groups in a push to get this software they had licensed from another company out of the door to all the cash registers the company had.  It was POS software - in both terms of the description (Point Of Sales) and its quality.\n\nThere were many gems scattered through there that I might expound upon... but one particular one sticks in my mind.  It was a fairly lengthy bit of code, though I've just used the first part of it.  The coder apparently knew that bit fields existed, and that they could be used somehow and you were one back from this function call... but skipped there rest of the lecture on that day.\n\n    int source = someFunc();\n    boolean keyed = false;\n    boolean nfc = false;\n    boolean swiped = false;\n    \n    switch(source) {\n      case 0:\n        keyed = false;\n        nfc = false;\n        swiped = false;\n        break;\n      case 1:\n        keyed = false;\n        nfc = false;\n        swiped = true;\n        break;\n      case 2:\n        keyed = false;\n        nfc = true;\n        swiped = false;\n        break;\n      case 3:\n        keyed = false;\n        nfc = true;\n        swiped = true;\n        break;\n    ...\n    }\n\nYes, this went on for all seven cases, and the default case too (can't have the compiler warning about that).  We called it the 'bit switch' and after looking at it for awhile (wondering why someone would write that) replaced it with some other code after making a note of it in the repo so that we could find it again when we wondered why they wrote some other code that way.  I'm just glad there wasn't four ways to enter a credit card number on this system.\n\n    int source = someFunc();\n    boolean keyed = source &amp; 0x1;\n    boolean nfc = source &amp; 0x2;\n    boolean swiped = source &amp; 0x4;\n",

        "text": "So when I was hired for my company it was to work on several of their applications that they maintained.  Several years down the road they wanted to get me into developing another one of their programs that to this time was all done by one guy and until me nobody else had worked with it.  The application is done in C++ and is a base project that's altered rather heavily on a project basis for each customer release.\n\nAnyways I worked on various releases of this over the years, in general the code was awful, and then one day a new project was starting up that was a bit different then others but this guy had released one version similar previously.  So I got the code from him (by email, he really never liked using our SVN install without being forced) and this is some of what I saw.\n\n\tstatic bool D1,D2,D8,D9,D10,D12,D13,D15,D16,D17,D18,D20,D34,D53,D65,D68,D71,D72,D74,D77,D79,D83,D84,D85,D91,D92,D95,D96,D99,D103,D104,D105,D106,BSC;\n\tstatic bool D1_UN,D2_UN,D8_UN,D9_UN,D10_UN,D12_UN,D13_UN,D15_UN,D16_UN,D17_UN,D18_UN,D20_UN,D34_UN,D53_UN,D65_UN,D68_UN,D71_UN,D72_UN,D74_UN,D77_UN,D79_UN,D83_UN,D84_UN,D85_UN,D91_UN,D92_UN,D95_UN,D96_UN,D99_UN,D103_UN,D104_UN,D105_UN,D106_UN,BSC_UN;\n\tbool TD, D1_1S,D2_1S,D8_1S,D9_1S,D10_1S,D12_1S,D13_1S,D15_1S,D16_1S,D17_1S,D18_1S,D20_1S,D34_1S,D53_1S,D65_1S,D68_1S,D71_1S,D72_1S,D74_1S,D77_1S,D79_1S,D83_1S,D84_1S,D85_1S,D91_1S,D92_1S,D95_1S,D96_1S,D99_1S,D103_1S,D104_1S,D105_1S,D106_1S,BSC_1S;\n\n\tstatic bool A1,A2,A3,A4,A5,A29,A30,A31,A32,A33,A34,A35,A36,A37,A38,A39,A40,A41,A42,A43,A44,A46,A47,A48,A49,A53,A55,A56,A57,A59,A60;\n\tstatic bool A1_UN,A2_UN,A3_UN,A4_UN,A5_UN,A29_UN,A30_UN,A31_UN,A32_UN,A33_UN,A34_UN,A35_UN,A36_UN,A37_UN,A38_UN,A39_UN,A40_UN,A41_UN,A42_UN,A43_UN,A44_UN,A46_UN,A47_UN,A48_UN,A49_UN,A53_UN,A55_UN,A56_UN,A57_UN,A59_UN,A60_UN;\n\tbool TA, A1_1S,A2_1S,A3_1S,A4_1S,A5_1S,A29_1S,A30_1S,A31_1S,A32_1S,A33_1S,A34_1S,A35_1S,A36_1S,A37_1S,A38_1S,A39_1S,A40_1S,A41_1S,A42_1S,A43_1S,A44_1S,A46_1S,A47_1S,A48_1S,A49_1S,A53_1S,A55_1S,A56_1S,A57_1S,A59_1S,A60_1S;\n\t...

Also the indentation/formatting is exactly as it was in the file, not a copy and paste mistake posting here.\n\nThis is reason 1 of what made me say \"Fuck this I'm rewriting this thing from scratch!\"",

        "text": "Hey guys, this subreddit is kind of dying, so I'm back with another doozy. \n\nMy company uses a stupid convoluted C#/ASP.NET CMS for our website (an online store) Due to a recent Chrome change/bug, some of our fonts aren't displaying correctly. So I have to fix it. Unfortunately, most of our fonts are controlled with inline HTML style attributes, like this (copied verbatim):\n\n    &lt;h1 style=\"font-family:Arial Black;font-size:20px;color:#f2c71c;\"&gt;Shopping  Cart&lt;/h1&gt;\n\nIt's easy to look at that and just sigh, for a few reasons. But that isn't why I'm here. While fixing the above idiocy, I stumbled across the following. This code is copied exactly as it appears on our site, only the src and href attributes have been changed.\n\n    &lt;script language=\"JavaScript\"&gt;\n\n    &lt;!--\n    a = 3 // a=numbers of banners\n    var slump = Math.random();\n    var talet = Math.round(slump * (a-1))+1;\n\n    function create() {\n            this.width = ''\n            this.height = ''\n            this.src = ''\n            this.href = ''\n        this.border = ''\n        this.alt = ''\n        this.under = ''\n    }\n\n    b = new Array()\n    for(var i=1; i&lt;=a; i++) { b[i] = new create() }\n\n    b[1].src    = \"images/product-baner.gif\"\n    b[1].href   = \"First-Product.aspx\"\n    b[1].width  = \"550\"\n    b[1].height = \"100\"\n    b[1].border = \"0\"\n    b[1].alt    = 'Go to product main category'\n    b[1].under  = ''\n\n    b[2].src    = \"images/2ndprdctsku-ad1.gif\"\n    b[2].href   = \"Second-Product.aspx\"\n    b[2].width  = \"550\"\n    b[2].height = \"100\"\n    b[2].border = \"0\"\n    b[2].alt    = 'Go to this product'\n    b[2].under  = ''\n\n    b[3].src    = \"images/another-product-baner.gif\"\n    b[3].href   = \"Third-Product.aspx\"\n    b[3].width  = \"550\"\n    b[3].height = \"100\"\n    b[3].border = \"0\"\n    b[3].alt    = 'Go to product main category'\n    b[3].under  = ''\n\n    var visa = \"\";\n    visa += '&lt;a href=\"'+b[talet].href+'\"&gt;'\n    visa += '&lt;img src=\"'+b[talet].src+'\" height='+b[talet].height\n    visa += ' width='+b[talet].width+' border='+b[talet].border+' alt='+b[talet].alt+'&gt;';\n    visa += '&lt;/a&gt;'\n\n    //--&gt;\n\n    &lt;/SCRIPT&gt;\n\n1000 lines down on the page:\n\n    &lt;script language=\"JavaScript\"&gt;\n    &lt;!--\n    document.write('&lt;table border=0 bordercolorlight=#f1f1f1 bordercolordark=#f1f1f1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'+visa+'&lt;br&gt;');\n    document.write(b[talet].under+'&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;');\n    //--&gt;\n    &lt;/script&gt;\n\nAll of this to randomly display one of three banner ads on our shopping cart page. Highlights:\n\n* Stupid way to calculate a random number\n* Stupid variable names\n* Starting an array at 1\n* Mixed tabs and spaces\n* Misspelling \"banner\" as \"baner\" is src attributes.\n* Putting the phrase \"ad1\" in a image name, so it gets blocked by all common ad blockers. \n* Useless \"under\" attribute.\n* Yes, the alt tags are also verbatim.\n* Weird create function",

And that's not the worst of it! You might think that to generate the open/closed ticket counts at the top of the main page, it would do something like an SQL COUNT query on the database. Nope. It was doing a SELECT on each row in the database and counting them all itself.\n\nSince tickets could have attached files, then each time the query got to a ticket entry in the database that had a file attached, it had to read that into memory as well as the entry itself!\n\nWe got that fixed to use COUNT queries and it went from being our slowest webapp to one of our fastest.",

        "text": "Just went looking through some of my old projects, this is from the very first version of my game, I was 18 (13 years ago) and have just \"learned\" C. Before judging me for writing so shitty code at that age, do note that Internet and access to learning resources generally was not as easy back then, especially in Poland. I could not afford a book, I was pretty much self taught based on Borland C manual (iirc).\n\nFirst, an example of very thorough commenting:\n\n\t a=0; // set a to zero, we'll need it \n\nAnd then the real deal:\n\n\t // 24 possible permutations for randomly placing 4 answers \n\t // P = n!, n = 4 : 4*3*2*1 = 24\n\t a = random(24); \n\t switch (a) {\n\t\t  case 0: show_question(oone,otwo,othree,ofour); break; // wish I knew how to do this right\n\t\t  case 1: show_question(oone,otwo,ofour,othree); break; // i don't\n\t\t  case 2: show_question(oone,othree,otwo,ofour); break; // but it's ok\n\t\t  case 3: show_question(oone,othree,ofour,otwo); break; // i will find out one day\n\t\t  case 4: show_question(oone,ofour,otwo,othree); break;\n\t\t  case 5: show_question(oone,ofour,othree,otwo); break; \n\t\t  case 6: show_question(otwo,oone,othree,ofour); break;\n\t\t  case 7: show_question(otwo,oone,ofour,othree); break;\n\t\t  case 8: show_question(otwo,othree,oone,ofour); break;\n\t\t  case 9: show_question(otwo,othree,ofour,oone); break;\n\t\t  case 10: show_question(otwo,ofour,oone,othree); break;\n\t\t  case 11: show_question(otwo,ofour,othree,oone); break;\n\t\t  case 12: show_question(othree,oone,otwo,ofour); break;\n\t\t  case 13: show_question(othree,oone,ofour,otwo); break;\n\t\t  case 14: show_question(othree,otwo,oone,ofour); break;\n\t\t  case 15: show_question(othree,otwo,ofour,oone); break;\n\t\t  case 16: show_question(othree,ofour,oone,otwo); break;\n\t\t  case 17: show_question(othree,ofour,otwo,oone); break;\n\t\t  case 18: show_question(ofour,oone,otwo,othree); break;\n\t\t  case 19: show_question(ofour,oone,othree,otwo); break;\n\t\t  case 20: show_question(ofour,otwo,oone,othree); break;\n\t\t  case 21: show_question(ofour,otwo,othree,oone); break;\n\t\t  case 22: show_question(ofour,othree,oone,otwo); break;\n\t\t  case 23: show_question(ofour,othree,otwo,oone); break;\n\t\t  default : show_question(oone,otwo,othree,ofour); break; // i hope, because this would be hard with 5 arguments\n\t }\n\nOne thing that surprises me though is that the code is usually pretty well commented (with more useful comments than those). The other thing that surprises me is the fact that game actually worked, despite the terrible code quality, and became very popular in Poland. Android version that I released two years ago got over 1.2 million downloads. ",

What could possibly go wrong?  Cue a year of development by three different people on the order model.\n\nThe pdf generated for each order uses `order.email`.  The notifications for each order are sent to `order.owner.email`.  The frontend displays `order.email`, which is uniformly null since `order.email` is not sent to the frontend.  The frontend sends analytics data tagged with `order.owner.email`.  `order.email` is only set when an order is copied, otherwise defaulting to an empty string.\n\nNote that like 90% of the posts on this subreddit, this might never have happened if the original author had commented their code.",

        "text": "Eight months ago, I walked into a Software-Dev job.  I was a bit inexperienced in this field, but perhaps not as naive as you might expect a normal junior-dev.  In a previous job, in another tech-field, I worked with a brilliant software-dev, producing tools and software for streamlining productivity within the company &amp; am thankful for that experience.\n\nFast forward several years and one career switch (to software dev) and pay-cut later, I find myself working at a startup under someone I'll call 'LeadDev.'  LeadDev is one of those guys who has more than 15 years of experience, wants to move up the food-chain, and found a startup-company naive enough to hire him as some kind of \"software architect;\" a position and title he seems obsessed at keeping to the extent of driving off our other 'senior' dev.  Practically speaking, he acts as a project lead/manager role for a web app.\n\nLets fast forward to a typical day.  I'm working hard on an assigned project, finally making progress, almost in the zone, hiding behind my giant headphones, and I see a hand waving out of the corner of my eye-for my attention.  I look over, and as usual, it's LeadDev, and he's already interrupted 2-3 other devs for whatever he wants to talk about.   Slowly I remove my headphones and hear *\"I need you to pay attention, because I have an important decision to make on a project I'm working on.\"*\n\nCollaboration is good right?  I sometimes 'ping' coworkers, to make sure I'm not doing something stupid, or that we're on the same page, but try to keep it as short as possible.  However, that's not what I'm talking about.  These aren't team-wide projects, but rather LeadDev's projects.  These impromptu meetings aren't 0.5-5 minutes, but rather 30-90 minutes, and on average 3 times a day.\n\nYou'd think that someone who considers themselves a 'software-architect' would be capable of making decisions and 'architecting' software, but perhaps it is me who misunderstands the role.\n\nAnyone else have similar stories?\n\nP.S.  As you might expect, I've already been looking at other opportunities.\n\nedit:  *\"RULES: All posts must have code.\"*  My apologies for not reading, this is coding related, but doesn't include code.\n\nedit2: [This article (and the series) seem applicable.](http://www.daedtech.com/up-or-not-ambition-of-the-expert-beginner)",

On top of this, the customer service rep behind me, 20 feet away, not separated by walls, was constantly complaining loudly about the calls, making rude and condescending comments to the customers, putting them on mute and calling them idiots out loud to us, then when they got mad she would put them on speakerphone for all of us to hear, then slam the phone down and scoff, sometimes bashing the phone against the desk repeatedly.\n\nThis turned into the rep snapping at people for asking questions or trying to help her, and her negativity rubbed off on the other reps. It even turned into a yelling match when one person wouldn't turn a door light off even though there were still people coming in and out and the managers didn't care but she wanted to save the planet.\n\nOther experiences I've had with customer service at other jobs were them being so loud and boisterous (or playing Journey at arena volumes) I couldn't focus on reading technical documentation and configuring Linux (really easy to screw that up), and a customer service rep coming up to a developer and reporting a bug directly (there was a process for that) and then getting angry when the developer wouldn't fix it right then; our manager had to come up and angrily tell him to go sit down or he'd take him to his manager.\n\nCare to add your own story or have you had wonderful experiences developing next to phone support?",

        "text": "Hello fellow developers. I will tell you a story about my ex-colleague programmer and how he managed to delay and mess up our project.\n  \nIt all started somewhere in September last year. Me, my friend got invited to work as part-time developers and got the task to create an online reservations module for their website. They already had something made by others, but it wasn't good enough. It worked; but could be better. They also had another guy for their job. He has autism and doesn't have many social-skills so my friend and I were not looking forward to work with him, but the client insisted since they heard great stories about him (from himself). He looked like a geek and acted like a geek; so he should be good; right?\n  \nTheir website was built on a very old Wordpress mess and it took about seven seconds to load the homepage. I immediately insisted to let go off wordpress due to its bad base and poor optimizations but they found that this was the best option. They agreed to change from some kind of overpriced shared webhost to a more powerful VPS so the website would run better; and that we could optimize it even further. This is where all the horror started.\n  \nWhen I came to work the next day, the VPS was already purchased and installed by ex-colleague. He put some kind of unstable build of Ubuntu on it together with Apache and an non-working Mail-server (he never got the mail working btw, we had to reinstall the whole thing in order to get it working). After chmodding the whole filesystem to 0777 he found that Apache worked again and the website was indeed a lot faster.\n  \nNow, we could finally start with our assigned project. I made our client very clear that hardcoding around in this Wordpress version would only make the mess bigger and that we could better create an stand-alone application and embed it in the website. After hours of arguing they agreed and I told them about a framework that I always use to make applications. They my ex-colleague jumped in and made them believe that *his* framework was the best. He promised that it had everything that we could came up with, and that it would be running in a few days. A few days later the client had agreed with his co-owner and they would be using the framework of my ex-colleague. I had no idea what to expect but my colleague said so many things about his framework: what could be wrong, lets try it.\n  \nHe then worked on the installation of his framework the next few weeks. He worked on days that we were not there and did not show us anything at all. We heard great stories and everything seemed to be working; so my friend and I let him do his thing. We just worked at the website itself and worked very hard the design (making it responsive and more web 3.0) and added a lot of new fancy jQuery-animations and tooltips. The odd thing was that we worked about three times a day, and he worked almost every day; not showing anything nor communicating what he was doing.\n  \nMy friend and I started making jokes and became curious what he was doing anyway. Our clients started to get a little nervous and began to put pressure on him. \"We were told that it would only take a few weeks, it is about thee months now...\", they told him. Due to his autism, he could not handle the criticism and pressure very well and only became more socially locked-out. We now passed new years eve and there was still nothing to see. But then..\n  \n\"It is done, he said\". He uploaded his framework to the website so we could see it. I could not believe my eyes. Nothing worked at all. It was literally a plain framework that he built from scratch in the time he used to be working ON TOP of his framework instead of ON the framework ITSELF. Me and my friend could not believe what we saw. First we did not want to say anything to our client because we felt bad for them but we decided to do so. I got assigned to be his supervisor and he needed to do exactly as I said; and we finally got things done. We ended up with me making the whole module on HIS crappy framework. He made lots of nasty code fragments and I need to work with those every now and then. Every time I see those snippets I cry in myself. He got fired as soon as it was up and running and we did not need him any more.\n  \n(Example: http://www.reddit.com/r/badcode/comments/28dnnv/my_excolleagues_code_for_checking_whether_a)\n  \n**TL;DR**\nHe was so full from himself and we had high expectations; but we found out that he couldn't even make basic for-loops and made the worst code and framework that you could imagine. I have learned from this. Every time someone says he is good at something, ask for evidence.\n\nStill working with the clients by the way. They love the work me and my friend deliver and are very happy with us. Now and then we laugh about this whole thing. Even though it was an pretty expensive joke.",

Simple, right?\n\nWell, it turns out that JavaServer Faces does NOT support file upload natively. Wait, it does, on version 2.2... well, kinda - but so far I haven't managed to integrate it in my project because it uses the Spring library, which isn't directly compatible with CDI. And we have to deploy it on Tomcat, because our boss decided NOT to use JBoss. \n\nI wasted 2 days trying to make it work, so I couldn't do it and have to conform with using JSF version 2.0.\n\nSo far, so good. After dealing with how to implement file upload, I found out that one of the libraries I've been using, RichFaces, has support for file upload. \n\nAnd then I found out I had to add events for when the user removes one uploaded file from the list, and it's not implemented natively. So I had to use a tag called \"a4j:jsFunction\" to do the event catching.\n\nAnd... it doesn't work. It doesn't. Fucking. Work. \n\nSo I opened the javascript console, revealing an error similar to this:\n\n&gt; Error: data: Undefined object \n\nBecause the manual said that you had to add oncomplete=\"myfunction(data)\". It took me more than an hour of web searching to find out that the correct usage (and not how the manual specifies) is oncomplete=\"myfunction(event.data)\". Go figure.\n\nA couple of minutes later, the file uploads are finally working, yay! (well, almost).\n\nPerfect. Now, to work on the validation of the required fields. I submit the full form (the file upload was using AJAX, so the form wasn't submitted yet).\n\nAnd.... nothing happens. The fuuu????\n\nTo stackoverflow! That site always has the answers.\n\n    SERVER DOWN FOR MAINTENANCE.\n\nAt this point my left eyebrow began to twitch with the speed of a cat chasing a laser beam. Okay, let's do this the hard way. To Google!\n\nAfter digging around, it turns out that JavaServer Faces does NOT support multipart/form-data natively. No, you have to write a special filter for it!\n\nFuck it. Let's do a workaround. I made two different forms, like this:\n\n    &lt;h:form id=\"form1\"&gt;\n        ... inputs here ...\n        &lt;div style=\"display:none\"&gt; &lt;!-- hidden submission links go here --&gt;\n            &lt;h:commandLink action=\"#{myBean.doStuff()}\"&gt;Submit&lt;/h:commandLink&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/h:form&gt;\n    &lt;h:form id=\"upload_form\" enctype=\"multipart/form-data\"&gt;\n        ... AJAX file uploads go here ...\n    &lt;/h:form&gt;\n    &lt;button onclick=\"activate_the_command_link_in_the_first_form();\"&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;\n\n\nPerhaps I should add that I wanted to do the whole system in PHP, and it would've taken me no more than a couple of hours.

I have scheduled to present a demo in a few days. Today, the spreadsheet developer said \"Oh, you're trying to use THOSE buttons. Of course they don't work. All the programming behind them is for a completely different project. No, we just manually type in our best guess, and do a few minutes of guess-and-check until we get a good result.\"\n\nI think I'm going to be sick. I've spent weeks on this, and the tools my program uses turn out to be non-functional. What did they expect me to do, write a random number generator in an engineering application so I can guess and check like they do?\n\n\n(In case that developer is reading, I should note that he's really good and helpful, and it's not his fault that he's been tasked with maintaining this spreadsheet).\n\nEDIT: As per request, here is a sample of a formula in the spreadsheet. I'm going by memory and formatting may be a bit off, but it is a very accurate representation of some of the worst functions that I'm working with:\n\n    =IF('TensileStrength'!B9*D47 + measuredAngle  - 'Calculation Errors'!D17&gt; 180, 'inputData'!B1:B27 =\n    VLOOKUP('Suppliers'!B9, inventoryItems, IF(VLOOKUP(customer, customerList, 3, FALSE), 2, 3)), \n    'Custom Orders'!B19:C27 = INDEX('dataSourceThatsWayTooBig'!, MATCH(Sheet5!C2, itemIndex, 1), 2))\n\n\nYes, there are complicated functions nested into other rather complicated functions, several times over. At least one function I've worked with goes 4 layers deep into nesting (thankfully they were all IF statements, so not too bad). This function would (I think) look at a needed property for a component, match up the inventory list from a supplier to the list of required parts for a customer, and insert whatever component worked into the target cell. Exact names and functionality have been modified to protect the innocent. For those not familiar with it, a name in apostrophes with an explanation mark like 'ThisItem'! means ThisItem is a spreadsheet, and a name like AnotherItem means that AnotherItem is a named range.",

        "text": "I once worked for a company that sold turn-key systems for processing research data. We sold customers an entire rack of servers along with the running software on them. I was hired long after the first versions of everything had been written, and original management and programmers had moved on, and I had inherited quite a mess of poorly written code. To be fair, much of the code base was written by programmers with research degrees, not C.S. engineers. My supervisor told me that one of the key pieces of server software had languished in development for 6 months and still didn't work. At all. The original manager was so furious he took everyone off the project except for the lead developer who was supposed to be supervising the project (he wasn't). Manager threatened to fire Lead if he didn't have something working by the following Monday. Lead spent a week of little sleep and the entire weekend making it work. It's the most jumbled mess of spaghetti code I have ever had the misfortune of trying to maintain. \n\nThese server systems were processing data 24/7, and any down time would cause customers to complain and threaten to go with a competitor. Since our service contracts were the majority of our revenue, we had to make absolutely sure that things were working. Original manager had given three edicts: 1) No down time due to exceptions in software, 2) No error messages should ever propagate to users, and 3) no server logging of any kind was permitted. I can't say for certain, but I think the reasoning behind this strategy was to give the appearance of reliability, regardless of the truth. \"It just works.\"\n\nThe end result was that the code was riddled with empty try/catch blocks and prolific null checks. Because there was no logging, there was no way to know if the software was running correctly except by looking at the output data to see if it looked \"correct\", whatever that meant. We had a full time technician whose primary job responsibility was to monitor the output of the client servers in the hopes that things were OK. Quite often, a server would simply stop producing output, but reported that it was \"working\". Our only solution was to restart the server and hope that whatever input data had caused the problem wouldn't cause it to go down again. If it did, the technician would call me and ask me why. I would have to load up all the various services into my debugging environment and send the offending data through the pipeline and hope I could spot the issue and perhaps come up with a fix. Sometimes, the output would be incorrect for weeks or months before someone noticed, and management would get upset.\n\nAfter a few years of this I was finally given permission to address the issue (crazy boss no longer worked there). I went to work improving things first by adding extensive logging and added a custom library that self-monitored the application by checking the state of specific classes to make sure things were healthy. Any unexpected exceptions or unhealthy behavior and the monitoring system shut down the service and alerted the technician. The code base was so bad, that it only served to expose how incorrect the software was and how often it failed. It was amazing that it ran at all, let alone give good output. Suddenly, I found myself spending the majority of my days trying to fix or workaround terrible bugs, and it took weeks before I could get the server software stable enough to run for longer than a day. It was a big deal if a server was up for longer than a week. I begged the current manager to let me rewrite the app many times and was always rebuffed. After dealing with this for over a year, I left for greener pastures and cited their unwillingness to address technical debt as one of my reasons for leaving. \n\nEDIT: I just noticed that the rules say \"must have code\". I don't know if I'm bending the rules with this story or not.",

I myself still tend to use i,j every one in a while but only if the scope of those iterators is less than about 15 lines of code.  \n\nThe user's code I was reviewing however was the worst I had seen.  The contract was up and they were moving on to greener pastures, so it was time for the code to be reviewed and last chance of cleanup made.  This code took the single letter variable naming to the extreme.  For fun when there were either not enough letters or  there were not enough letters in the alphabet you even found cases of x1, x2.  Global variables often only had a single letter as well.  One in particular caught my eye,  There was a \"int w\" variable, which decided between two functional modes, say ConCarne vs SinCarne.  Sure my first thought was why is this a global variable just sitting by itself?  Then I wonder why not define an enum instead of testing against 0,1 constants everywhere.  In this case even a boolean would have worked assuming a name like g_hasMeat. Then I wonder wtf does 'w' even stand for.\n\nWell as the remaining time was limited,  It was way to risky for any serious re-architecture of the code.  What we could do however is attempt to fix some variable names to provide more context as to what the code was trying todo.\n\nOn the next review I see \n\n    int w;\nWas replaced with \n\n    int which;\n\nYes, 'w' in this case had stood for 'which'.

        "text": "So about 15 years back I was consulting for a company and assigned to review the code of one of my problem peers.  The module was a low level C code driver for some particular custom hardware.  For you non-embedded folks, Hardware is usually memory mapped and you can access hardware variables just like any other variable you just need to specify the address manually.    This particular HW had multiple data fields contained within each single 32 bit address.  \n\nMy peer wrote all his entire driver with code like:\n\n    CONTROL_REG1 = 0x38AC9109;\n    CONTROL_REG2 = 0x84ABCD12;\n    CONTROL_REG1 = 0X7FFF1212;\n\nI complained in the review that you shouldn't just use raw hex numbers, you need to use #defines to make what you are doing intelligable.  I went on to show an example showing something like this is much more readable:\n\n    CONTROL_REG1 = ENABLE_TRANSMIT | ENABLE_RECEIVE | BAUD_RATE_19200;\n\nHe listened to the part where I said he needed to at least use #defines instead of just raw numbers, but ignored the intent.   At the next review his code looked like:\n\n    #define REG_INIT1_38AC9109 0x38AC9109\n    #define REG_INIT2_84ABCD12 0x84ABCD12\n    #define REG_INIT1_7FFF1212  0x7FFF1212\n\n    CONTROL_REG1 = REG_INIT1_38AC9109;\n    CONTROL_REG2 = REG_INIT2_84ABCD12;\n    CONTROL_REG1 = REG_INIT1_7FFF1212;\n\nHis response when I complained again,  I'm the only person in charge of this block, so nobody but me would need to understand how it works.  At that point I was glad I was just the contractor and wouldn't be working there full time.  \n\nBonus:  Naturally when the Hardware came in the driver didn't work.  Many of those hard coded register settings were not correct.  So just when you think it couldn't get worse the following was checked into the repository:\n\n    #define REG_INIT2_84ABCD12 0x12345678\n\n",

Turns out that that was not the only code responsible for loading it. Turns out there are 2 things reponsible for loading the component. The component can load itself, and the parent can load it, both query the server, both set all the properties.\n\nGetting frustrated I start to look at removing the duplicate code from the parent, and I find this at the top of the javascript object definition:\n\n\n    main: null,\n    depotDetail: null,\n    currentRecord: null,\n    statusBar: null,\n    searchResultData: null,\n    searchStore: null,\n    searchResultGrid: null,\n    depotDetail: null,\n    depotDetail: null,\n\nNotice that `depotDetail` is set to null 3 times. This codebase doesn't ever use `===`, so `null` and `undefined` are functionally equivalent, so even one definition would be redundant.\n\nThey are placed here so that developers can look in a single spot for where the fields are, but apparently nobody even looks at this kind of stuff.

        "text": "A few years ago I started working for a web agency as a junior web dev and first met \"Manuel\" (not his real name). He was their senior backend developer and was currently working on a huge project in PHP. Most of us were doing both frontend and backend in WP, but he wasn't really strong when it came to frontend stuff, I was told, so somehow he ended up being tasked just... writing the entire codebase.\n\nHe was working in PHP and I soon learned that he wasn't using a framework or even OOP techniques. In fact, he had never heard of OOP. But he had over 10 years of experience and had worked on bank software in his home country before moving abroad and settling in my country.\n\nManuel was a nice guy but without a doubt a little strange. He would take notes in his own made up language (like encryption) that he frequently forgot how to decode. He didn't believe in commenting code, or saw any real purpose of indentation, so his code was at first glance hard to comprehend. Soon I realized that this was by design - he purposely obfuscated code so that only he would be able to read it.\n\nManuel didn't really subscribe to principles of DRY either. He would instead copy huge functions whenever he needed to make an alteration, and tack on a \"_2\" or something to the function name. Sometimes he had multiple functions or even database tables with the same name, only one ending with \"_real\". This was of course undocumented, and the database tables never had any keys or indexes. He loved joining tables, and wrote his SQL straight up in the same function that rendered the output, every time. This eventually produced one legendary query that, according to the MySQL Slow query log, took 10 seconds to execute.\n\nAs I previously mentioned, Manuel was an immigrant. This wouldn't normally be a problem - I know several guys who've come over to work in IT and they are doing quite well. However, his language skills was... somewhat lacking. So what he ended up with was a mix of three languages, when naming functions, tables and other stuff.\n\nToday Manuel isn't working here anymore. He was let go last year, but after a 2 year stint, leaving us with a bunch of unsustainable, unworkable and poorly written projects to maintain and cry about. I feel like I learned an important lesson: always test your applicants, even if they have a pretty good CV. And never let someone new work alone without reviewing their code.\n\nFinally, just choosing something to highlight the full potential of Manuel was hard. There's just so much impossible to understand code, but this piece from a script that sent text messages has always been a \"favorite\" of mine:\n\n    function checkkey($sender,$formtime,$ispersonalized,$clientkey,&amp;$realsenderip){\n\t$wret=\"\";\n\tif ($ispersonalized==\"\") $ispersonalized=0;\n\t$wclientkeylist=explode(\"/#/\",base64_decode(base64_decode(urldecode($clientkey))));\n\t$wlientkey=base64_decode($wclientkeylist[0]);\n\t$wclientid=substr(base64_decode($wclientkeylist[1]),4,-4);\n\t$wclientname=base64_decode(substr(base64_decode($wclientkeylist[2]),11,-11));\n\t$wclientdatetime=base64_decode(substr(base64_decode($wclientkeylist[3]),4,-4));\n\t$wclientip=\"[\".base64_decode(substr(base64_decode($wclientkeylist[4]),4,-4)).\"]\";\n\t$wsenderip=base64_decode(substr(base64_decode($wclientkeylist[5]),4,-4));\n\t$realsenderip=$wsenderip;\n\t$wwsenderip=\"[\".$wsenderip.\"]\";\n\tif ($sender==$wclientname and $formtime==$wclientdatetime){\n\t\t$resultl=mysql_query(\"select id from sms_client where id='$wclientid'\");\n\t\tif (mysql_num_rows($resultl)==1){\n\t\t\tlist($idl) = mysql_fetch_array($resultl);\n\t\t\t$resultr=mysql_query(\"select sencript, canpersonal, fromtext11, clientips, datestart, dateend, activechecksender, senderips from sms_client where id='$idl'\");\n\t\t\tlist($sencriptr, $canpersonalr, $fromtext11r, $clientipsr, $datestartr, $dateendr, $activechecksenderr, $senderipsr) = mysql_fetch_array($resultr);\n\t\t    $wtoday=date(\"Y-m-d\");\n\t\t\tif (!($fromtext11r==$sender)) $wret.=\"INI Error 1\";\n\t\t\tif (!($fromtext11r==$wclientname)) $wret.=\"INI Error 2\";\n\t\t\tif (!($ispersonalized==$canpersonalr or $ispersonalized==0)) $wret.=\"INI Error 3\";\n\t\t\tif (!(strpos(\"--\".$sencriptr.$sencriptr,$wlientkey)&gt;0)) $wret.=\"INI Error 4\";\n\t\t\tif (!(strpos(\"--\".$clientipsr,$wclientip)&gt;0)) $wret.=\"INI Error 5\";\n\t\t\tif (!(($datestartr==\"0000-00-00\" and $dateendr==\"0000-00-00\") or ($datestartr&lt;=$wtoday and $wtoday&lt;=$dateendr))) $wret.=\"INI Error 6\";\n\t\t\tif (!($activechecksenderr==\"0\" or ($activechecksenderr==\"1\" and strpos(\"--\".$senderipsr,$wwsenderip)&gt;0))) $wret.=\"INI Error 7\";\n\t\t\t/*if ($fromtext11r==$sender) echo \"&lt;br&gt;1\";\n\t\t\tif ($fromtext11r==$wclientname) echo \"&lt;br&gt;2\";\n\t\t\tif ($ispersonalized==$canpersonalr or $ispersonalized==0) echo \"&lt;br&gt;3\";\n\t\t\tif (strpos(\"--\".$sencriptr.$sencriptr,$wlientkey)&gt;0) echo \"&lt;br&gt;4\";\n\t\t\tif (strpos(\"--\".$clientipsr,$wclientip)&gt;0) echo \"&lt;br&gt;5\";\n\t\t\tif (($datestartr==\"0000-00-00\" and $dateendr==\"0000-00-00\") or ($datestartr&lt;=$wtoday and $wtoday&lt;=$dateendr)) echo \"&lt;br&gt;6\";\n\t\t\tif ($activechecksenderr==\"0\" or ($activechecksenderr==\"1\" and strpos(\"--\".$senderipsr,$wwsenderip)&gt;0)) echo \"&lt;br&gt;7\";*/\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tif ($fromtext11r==$sender and $fromtext11r==$wclientname and ($ispersonalized==$canpersonalr or $ispersonalized==0) and strpos(\"--\".$sencriptr.$sencriptr,$wlientkey)&gt;0 and strpos(\"--\".$clientipsr,$wclientip)&gt;0 and (($datestartr==\"0000-00-00\" and $dateendr==\"0000-00-00\") or ($datestartr&lt;=$wtoday and $wtoday&lt;=$dateendr)) and ($activechecksenderr==\"0\" or ($activechecksenderr==\"1\" and strpos(\"--\".$senderipsr,$wwsenderip)&gt;0))){\n\t\t\t\t$wret=\"OK\";\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t\t\n\t}\n\t\n\treturn $wret;\n}\n",

Tied how, exactly? The header table contains a field called @Opt, which is a varchar, but in *this* case it's actually interpreted as an integer which is an index into the VB.NET array of table fields. You see, the reason we don't have a direct foreign key reference to the fields table is because the header table is also used to store information about every other form element we might have, such as, say, the label we want to put on a textbox (which in turn is a pointer to our language glossary table).\n\n...You see, you have to understand that the predecessor to *that* legacy system was Access databases on multiple computers that were \"replicated\" across systems by software engineers with ZIP disks.",

The tool will not run on OSes newer than XP. (The tool is a piece of garbage, btw). After doing our projects in B2Logic we have to export some intermediary files from it to the network file system, close the XP VM, and move on to phase 2.\n\n2. Open a VMWare session to a Windows 7 VM. Sounds better? It's not. Once in we need to launch a special SSH utility and connect to a Linux server. The Linux server houses a perl script written c. 2004 that was compiled to a Linux binary by the demo version of some lost-to-history Perl-to-exe compiler. ~~Oh, and the original Perl source file is lost; we only have the binaries~~ [Dog found the source](http://www.reddit.com/r/programminghorror/comments/21e2km/this_is_the_toolchain_we_are_expected_to_use/cgc6hr5). The purpose of this script is to convert the output of B2Logic into a format that the final step in our toolchain, L-Edit, can use.     \n     But wait! There's more. The Linux server *doesn't* have network file system access, so we have to move all the intermediate files produced by B2Logic to the Linux server with scp from within the Windows 7 VM that has network file system access and the special SSH client we have to use, and then the product of the Perl script back to the Network File system with another scp command. Bonus: We're not allowed to let the SSH client remember our password, so we have to type the password in every time we do a scp.\n\n3. Finally, we have the last intermediate file on the network file system. Launch L-Edit (a version 5 years out of date), set 3 parameters in two different windows to specific values (in a particular order, no less, or it doesn't work. The parameters also reset every time you launch L-Edit). Import the output of the Perl script, hit OK at least 3 times, and in about 300ms you have you finished product (If you didn't botch anything along the way, of course. 'else it's back to the XP VM!). Save the result to the Network File system and you are home free!\n\nI understand that money is tight but ........ Really? REALLY? We actually have to do this???\n\nSigh...\n\n\n\nUpdate: With the source provided by Dog I was able (with some difficulty) to create a version of BLT that runs on Windows XP. That cuts the insanity of the toolchain down to about a third. ",

With the database, \nAll these problems are because a few years ago, they hired someone to migrate from their old system to a MySQL database.\nI am seeing terrible indexes, Varchars that should be ints, text that should be ints and indexes on text fields that join to ints. \nNo floats or decimals even though we store monetary values. \nNavigating through the database is almost impossible, because the table and column names make no sense. \nI see rarely any auto increments present at all, and there are absolutely NO parent / child relationships, because of this, a lot of tables are linear.  \nAs you can tell, the database itself was terribly designed, I honestly can't say one good thing about it. \nMaybe that it runs would be a good thing, but I am surprised it is functional in its current state.\n\n\n\nThis company is growing.. and rapidly. \nI don't feel like the database will be able to handle everything we will be doing in the coming years.\nThere are 3 other web programmers in my department, are of which are great to work with and feel the same as I do about our situation.  \nThe problems I mentioned above have been inherited; meaning, is not any of their faults. \nSince they've been hired it seems to be going in a good direction, we started using github to host the code\nas opposed to ftping things, We've also been trying to make sure no XSS and SQL injections are possible.\nSlowly and steadily we are building up to a good foundation.\n\n\n\nHere is my main problem. I have been given projects to create new pages for the site from scratch, ones that have been sitting idol for the past couple years. \nI feel that adding new features is prolonging the inevitable, which is redesigning a database and writing new code.\nI know companies hear the word re-write and freak out, as if everything should run smooth and if something breaks, use a band-aid to solve the problem.\nWith things as broken as they are I feel like a redesign and rewrite are needed and achievable because the company is fairly small now. \nIn my opinion, it would be wise to start before they grow to large to manage such a huge project. \n\n\n\nI was wondering if anyone else has been in a similar situation? \n\nHow did you go about it? \n\nWhat did the employer say?",

In this case the desired response would be some sort of closeness score, say 0.75, along with the full text that fuzzily matched:\n\n    3 apples, cored and cut into 1 inch chunks\n    2 oranges, peeled and diced, retaining juice\n    2 bananas\n\n) ^\\*\n\nSo, I cheerfully used python's `itertools.permutations` to loop over all the other possible list orders to check whether they'd merely entered them in a different order. \n\nHere's a simplified version of the code:\n\n    import itertools\n    from .utils import fuzzy_matcher\n\n    def match_against(input, original):\n        try:\n            input = input.split() # input should be an array\n        except AttributeError:\n            pass\n        score, matched = fuzzy_matcher(input, original)\n        same_order = True\n        if score &lt; MINIMUM_SCORE:\n            for input_reordered in itertools.permutations(input):\n                this_score, this_matched = fuzzy_matcher(input_reordered, original)\n                if this_score &gt; score:\n                    score, matched = this_score, this_matched\n                    same_order = False\n        return score, matched, same_order\n\n    how_close, what_was_matched, order_is_same = match_against(user_input, original_content)\n\n\nThis worked fine for all the tests I did using lists of 2 items, 3 items, etc. all the way up to 6-7 or so.\n\nOnce it was live, for certain requests the server would end up hanging. CPU usage would skyrocket. Eventually the whole server slowed to a crawl.\n\nTo figure out what was going on I ran the function in question over the input from the bad request. I saw that it kept looping over and over without ever appearing to stop. I finally narrowed it down to the line where I had it go through the different iterations of input.\n\nI then saw that the input had 11 items in it. Curious, I decided to [look up how many permutations 11 items would create](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=permutations+for+11+items). Turns out it's nearly **40 million** (39,916,800 to be exact).\n\nI then did a little more research on how permutations are calculated; as the title states, for n items it's *n!* . Pretty sure I went over this sometime in high school, but that was almost 20 years ago.\n\nFortunately, this had a simple fix:\n\n        if score &lt; MINIMUM_SCORE and len(input) &lt;= 5:\n\nI'm actually cool with a loop that repeats a hundred times, but not one that repeats thousands or millions of times. Especially since that covers over 97% of cases. \n\n**TLDR**: I forgot basic statistics and exploded my server with math.\n\n\n\\* __EDIT__: For clarification the \"other input\" in this case was a tokenized block of text which could not be sorted, because it was important to match user input in-place. As a result, in order to correctly fuzzily match, **the user input had to be re-ordered to match the order in the other input**.\n",

        "text": "At work we use a framework that means you don't have to know HTML or CSS (or migrate your users from 12 year old browsers, which are no longer used). This framework has been the source of so many of my nightmares, and this is an example why:\n\nI was asked to look into a problem with our nav buttons. Basically with this framework you specify everything javascript and then it generates HTML code (that is apparently IE6 compliant, even though our work has mandated that at the least we require IE8, and new stuff only supports IE9 officially). It seemed like a simple enough problem, and with any sensible code base it would've been, but there's the code that this framework generates to create our button:\n\n\t&lt;td class=\"x-toolbar-cell\" id=\"framework-gen389\"&gt;\n\t   &lt;table id=\"btn-Home\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"x-btn x-btn-noicon x-btn-pressed\" style=\"width: auto;\"&gt;\n\t      &lt;tbody class=\"x-btn-small x-btn-icon-small-left\"&gt;\n\t         &lt;tr&gt;\n\t            &lt;td class=\"x-btn-tl\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n\t            &lt;td class=\"x-btn-tc\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n\t            &lt;td class=\"x-btn-tr\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n\t         &lt;/tr&gt;\n\t         &lt;tr&gt;\n\t            &lt;td class=\"x-btn-ml\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n\t            &lt;td class=\"x-btn-mc\"&gt;&lt;em class=\" x-unselectable\" unselectable=\"on\"&gt;&lt;button type=\"button\" id=\"framework-gen390\" class=\" x-btn-text\"&gt;Home&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n\t            &lt;td class=\"x-btn-mr\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n\t         &lt;/tr&gt;\n\t         &lt;tr&gt;\n\t            &lt;td class=\"x-btn-bl\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n\t            &lt;td class=\"x-btn-bc\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n\t            &lt;td class=\"x-btn-br\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n\t         &lt;/tr&gt;\n\t      &lt;/tbody&gt;\n\t   &lt;/table&gt;\n\t&lt;/td&gt;\n\nYes that is a button created with a table. Yes it has 9 cells, yes they are called `x-btn-tl` (for top left part of the button) and so on. Yes those are filled with a non-breaking space inside a deprecated italics tag. (The framework also takes it upon itself to remove the default styling associated with `em` or `strong`)\n\nAlso you'll notice that table is inside a table. Yes the nav bar is also a table, inside another table, inside 6 or 7 other divs and tables, all for a pretty basic button on a nav bar.\n\nWhy is the button split into 9 pieces? Well because it applies a separate style to each one in order to get a rounded corner and a gradient using background images.\n\nIs IE6 support really that necessary that you're willing to produce the ugliest code that has ever existed. Can't you live with unrounded corners in a browser that's 12 years old? You couldn't use any of the number of CSS hacks and leave the html clean (and more importantly have IE6 support as an additional stylesheet, leaving the main free)?\n\nLuckily the company has created a new version that's incompatible with the current version, so it's just as difficult to migrate versions as it is to migrate away to actual html.",
