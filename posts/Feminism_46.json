Why speak out now?  \n\nYet here I am in my room having flashbacks to my nightmares, scared to tell my parents about what a babysitter's husband dis to me at 3-4 years old repeatedly. Memories I held back for years. But I'm scared tp tell my own mother bc I know I'll be branded a liar in their eyes.  This is why. Why both men and women don't come forth. ",

        "text": "\\\\\\\\WARNING LONGINSH POST//\n\nI'd like to state that I support woman equality in every way I knowingly can. I understand and agree that women have been suppressed for centuries.\n\nPlease don't hate me for being open. If you disagree with me, please convince me othewise, I only want the best for everyone.\n\nI believe that men are seen  through the same societal lense when it comes to nudity. Sure, women still wear bikinis to beaches because nipples are still oversexualized by most males, however, muscular male chest muscles are oversexualized by some females too. It isn't seen as wrong to do either in societies eyes, as far as I've experienced. But, I do think when you have attractive features to show of, no matter your gender, you end up making an unspoken statement to those around you, I would guess.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnto my intended question:\n\nIs it wrongful of me - as a feminsit - to be  against my friends and girlfriend  crave to show more skin on instagram as a way of self empowerment? (naked bodies, bumms and boobs showing. Bottom genitals and nipples sometimes covered with a sticker or emoji)\n\nI 100% believe it's their choice and have every right to do so, but do I have the right to feel uncomfortable with my girlfriend doing it?\n\nNOTE WE ARE ALL BETWEEN 18-22\n\nI see males do it too on insta sometimes, and I honestly have the same opinion as I do to girls doing it; I see it as seeking acceptance externally from others. The only acceptance anyone should seek is from themselves from within themselves...It is not healthy to seek public acceptance for who you are. Males are often bigs, and sexualize most naked photos of woman on insta and facebook, mostly.\n\nSeeing male genitals, unless it's mine, grosses me out, while female genitalia more than generally turns me on. That being said, I just don't want to frequently see naked humans. Maybe because I don't want to send random women sexual energy, neither of us deserve that. I don't want to send gross energy to males either. Nor do I want to be over sexualized, nor my girlfriend or friends.\n\nThoughts? Am I wrong?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR: I am fully supportive of women empowerment as a male feminist.I believe male and female nudity are both sexualized by society:Women's breasts and male muscular chest.My friends and girlfriend (all under 22, youngest 18) frequently post nipple pictures on insta. 100% their choice to do what they please. I see it the same way I do with men posting muscle pictures, for self empowerment. When it comes to my girlfriend, and friends, I feel as though they should seek self acceptance and empowerment from the only true source, within. I don't think nudity on social media is the way to bring equality. They are frequently posting more and more body parts. Nipples with markings, bare nippes, and bum. This to me, a male, who finds these body features attractive, can't see the difference between this and seeking acceptance externally. I don't agree with it.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",
