        "text": "So last year I saw a hilarious video of a lady on the phone with a spam caller. She keeps him talking until she puts her phone under a metal pot &amp; bangs the shit out of it with a spoon. \n\nGreat idea but I never have anything near me when the opportunity arises. I remembered I have a metal emergency whistle in my camping gear so I put it on my key ring &amp; bam...ready! \n\nI don't normally answer spam calls thanks to caller ID identifying them. But sometimes those fuckers slip by, like today. \n\nThere was that lengthy pause after I answered &amp; said hello a few times before the guy spoke. He introduces himself &amp; says we're speaking on a recorded line. He asks is he speaking to my name &amp; I go uh-huh. He says it again &amp; I go uh-huh. He says it again &amp; says is that yes or no bc of the recorded line...uh🤨. \n\nAfter I say yes, he says my birthday which I say uh-huh again. He repeats his statement again. I keep saying uh-huh all the while I'm making my way over to my keys. The next time he repeats his statement again, I blow the whistle...HARD...over &amp; over. I look &amp; see if the call ended but the timer is still going so I end the call bc I'm already a little winded 🤣 \n\nIn the other room, my kid's like what's going on &amp; I told her spam call.",

        "text": "This is a bit more on the wholesome end of the spectrum, so I hope it's a good read for you all.\n\nMy son is five years old, and is annoyingly lazy. Like \"I'm perfectly capable of walking by myself but please carry me for hours because I don't want to walk\" lazy. Also the \"Riding my bike is too hard!\" when we're trying to get to the park kind when I literally watch this kid zip all over the neighborhood after his older sister while they're on their bikes. It's irritating to say the least.\n\nHowever, he's also competitive. He loves to race. So when I go to drop him off at school, we have a routine where we race to the front doors and see who can press the wheelchair assistance button first. (Side note: Those doors have the worst hydraulics ever and are almost impossible for ME, a free-standing and typical adult, to open unassisted, so please no comments about abusing the handicap assistance.) \n\nI've gotten it down to an art, where his hand literally has to brush past mine to press the button first. So now, every time I have to needlessly carry him (and trust me, that isn't often these days as he's getting to be a bit too big for me to carry), I feel better knowing I'm at least getting a little cardio into his day.",

        "text": "Sorry in advance, this is a bit of a long one, but I think it's important to know more about the character and history of the people involved to truly understand why we did what we did. To start off this tale of revenge happened around a month ago during the Super Bowl and takes place in Kansas City where as most of you know The Kansas City Chiefs were playing the Philadelphia Eagles. The main characters are obviously myself with a large group of friends, a friend we'll call Cameron, and his piece of shit roommate we'll just call asshole because it perfectly sums up his character.\n\nNow a bit about asshole, asshole is one of those people that thinks he's a genius, Gods gift to women, and just all around superior to everyone else no matter who he's around. Some people are cocky and very self confident but are still good people, and there's nothing wrong with that. Asshole was not one of those people, you see the problem with asshole is he's very vocally a piece of shit and not only that but he actively works to put people down and make them feel bad when he's around because he thinks it makes him look better. The truth is asshole isn't really that smart, or good looking, but worst of all is the fact that his personality is so off putting and he's so mean that he really doesn't have any friends. This makes asshole very upset, because it's a huge hit to his ego and he knows he's amazing and everyone should be blown away by how great he is. It's rather sad once you realize the truth about him, but he makes it impossible to feel bad for him because it's obvious that being a douche is a point of pride and he has no interest in looking inward or trying to change his ways. He has massive insecurities and these insecurities lead to him putting down absolutely everyone he comes into contact with including strangers. Just as an example, If one of his roommates ever brought a girl back to the house, no matter what she looked like he would find some way to put the girl down or belittle her and the roommate who brought her back both in person and behind their backs. In the past he's referred to female guest / roommates love interests as wildebeest, or he would loudly ask what's up with the linebacker in the living room, it's just constant non stop insults to everyone. He's misogynistic, racist, homophobic, lacks any empathy, actively tries to hurt everyone, and just is an all around spoiled kid that grew up on 3rd base and thinks he hit a triple making him better than everyone else. Maybe the best way to sum him up is by his favorite people/podcasts, he loves Andrew Tate, Ben Shapiro, and Steven Crowder amongst others if that gives you any indication.\n\nNow onto Cameron. Cameron on the other hand is a great guy, he has a younger kid and while he is separated from his ex they still get along and he shares parenting responsibility and is a great dad. But biggest of all Cameron is a blast to hang around with and is a friend to everyone. Cameron has lived with asshole for years renting a room in the house that assholes parents own and provided for him to live in. You may be asking why live with such a horrible person, and that's a very valid question and one that was my question to Cameron as well. Well the truth is the rent was cheap, Cameron work had him traveling all around the country constantly so he was barely at home, and best of all asshole also worked out of state and had an apartment in a city over a thousand miles away where he spent most of his time as well. So this meant asshole and Cameron were hardly ever in town at the same time so in person interactions were very limited. But that didn't stop the horrible text messages, phone calls, and chats from asshole whenever he felt low or not as great as he wanted (so all the time).\n\nThe beginning of February asshole informs Cameron that his parents were selling the house and he had to be out in under a month, this came completely out of the blue and a good friend/person would've informed the tenets that they were considering selling the house to you know give a bit of heads up. Nope, just \"you have to be out of here by X date\". Cameron is in a fairly new relationship and was hoping to move in with her maybe end of the year, but this pushed up the timeline by a lot and forced him to scramble to find somewhere to live. Thankfully he found a place that's not great but works for the time being and as of my writing this is fully moved out and is why I'm finally telling this story since asshole holds no real leverage over Cameron anymore.\n\nOk enough backstory, it's Super Bowl Sunday, and like most Chiefs fans we (everyone but asshole) made plans to watch the super bowl at a packed bar with a large group of friends while asshole stayed at home where he was throwing his own party. When I mentioned earlier that asshole has no real friends, this is an example of that as his Super Bowl party consisted of 4 people total including himself (2 of the other 3 were his Mom and Dad). Now since asshole spent most of the year at his apartment in a city over a thousand miles away all the utilities are in Cameron's name including the internet (I'm sure you can see where this is going). We got to the bar a couple hours before the game to pregame and catch up. This inevitably led to us talking about how Cameron had to scramble to find a place to live and we started exchanging stories about the horrible things asshole had done and said to pretty much everyone at the table including girlfriends, wives, etc. I guess at this point I should say that I personally only interacted with asshole twice and both times left me thinking he's the most miserable/off putting person I've ever had the displeasure of being around and I left both interactions legit pissed off at asshole. I told my stories and I wasn't alone, everyone at the table had awful stories and Cameron who as I said above is a great guy, easy going and just a friend of everyone told us some of the worst stories of all seeing as how he put up with years of abuse from asshole. With Cameron's impending move out of the house, we decided we should have some fun and enact some revenge for the years of abuse.\n\nKansas City is one of the few cities around to have Google fiber which is important, because it has top of the line internet speeds and since it's a Google product the interface and control you have over your network from your phone/computer is next level. Because the internet is so good Cameron didn't feel the need to purchase any television for the house and instead he would strictly watch television and sports through the streaming apps. This meant the Super Bowl party that asshole was throwing was fully reliant on the usually bullet proof internet connection. That night, the internet was once again bullet proof, well that is until half time started. You see we wanted to give asshole the impression that everything was working perfectly, so we didn't mess with anything the first half of the game in an effort to lull him into a false sense of security. But that all changed two minutes into the halftime show because while we know asshole may not care too much about the halftime show his parents absolutely did. So while Rihanna is out there killing it with her great performance we reset the router for the first time. This reset takes about 3-4 minutes during which time he would be required to reset the streaming apps and probably led to some confusion about what happened because like I said the internet is usually bullet proof and never has issues. I would've loved to be a fly on the wall in the room as this happened. At this point we decided to let it sit for a while and didn't touch the router again until the very beginning of the 4th quarter. I mean we can't have him making other plans or finding another way to watch the game can we?\n\nSo the 4th quarter starts and the Chiefs have the ball and are driving down the field getting close to tying up / taking the lead in the game. As soon as the Chiefs got inside the 10 yard line and are about to score, you guessed it time for a router reset. Sorry you didn't get to see that touchdown asshole, sucks to suck, but we're just getting started. I guess I should point out that since we were watching the game at a bar, they were receiving the game over the air which meant we were seeing the game about as close to real time as you can get. Meanwhile asshole is streaming and as most of you know there's a bit of a delay. This meant our watch party saw things a couple seconds ahead, meaning we knew what was going to happen and could reset on any big play, or pivotal moment. That 4th quarter we made sure the internet went down at the worst possible moments. We continued to strategically reset the router anytime we felt something happened that asshole didn't deserve to enjoy. Did I mention we all were having a blast, and drinking a lot (Hello touchdown shots)? So as the game wound down we started resetting the router faster and faster until with about 4 minutes to go we just started resetting the router immediately after it was back up and running. We kept resetting the router all the way through the end of the game, and continued through the postgame interview with the players and only stopped when they cut away from the celebration to go to local news. Overall asshole and his party missed pretty much every major play at the end of the game and I doubt asshole is even smart enough to realize we're the reason he missed one of the biggest sporting events in his lifetime and if he does, good fuck him. The whole thing was very therapeutic and while it didn't make up for the years of abuse and torment, it resulted in a great time for all involved at the bar that night. We all celebrated, hugged, had celebratory shots and lived on cloud nine celebrating our cities championship, while I can only assume assholes watch party devolved into someone finally seeing that the chiefs won via score updates from the ESPN app on someones phone.\n\nHere's a tip asshole, maybe try not begin a miserable piece of shit and you won't have people going out of their way to ruin your little watch party. Thankfully now that Cameron is out of the house we have no reason to ever interact with asshole again.\n\nI'm sorry if I rambled or if any of this doesn't make sense, I'm not the best story teller, but hopefully some of you appreciate this tale of an awful human being finally reaping just a little bit of what they deserve.\n\ntl:dr A horrible person who seems to only have the goal of hurting others in an effort to make themself feel better has their Super Bowl watch party ruined when they can't see the big plays or end of the game after we take turns resetting the internet router. This effectively killed their live stream of the game forcing them and their watch party to miss their favorite team winning the Super Bowl.",

This is one of the more tame examples of our revenge.\n\nOne day, my buddy and I are hanging around the local mall and find a case of those Chick religious tracts.  If you don't know, these are little comic books that essentially claim everything you like is a sin and you're going to Hell for it.  \"Happy Halloween?  You're going to Hell, Billy.\"  Look for \"Chick gospel\" for hilarious examples.\n\nSo we take this case of abandoned books and read some of them for a larff.  I noticed on their backs is an area for some kind of branding, like a stamp, below the phrase \"Courtesy of your friends at:\"\n\nI took the whole case to the office and waited until the receptionist was away on lunch.  I then proceeded to stamp the backs of each of those books with our company's name, which included address, phone, and email.\n\nThe following weekend, my buddy and I went back to the mall and handed them out to people, saying things like,\"Fornicator! Sinner!  You're going to Hell! Repent!\" and had more larffs from the shocked looks on peoples' faces.\n\nThe following Monday, there was a company-wide crisis email and phone conference about these Chick books, and how bad the company is looking because people thought it was officially-sanctioned by our company.  How did our company's name get on them?  Who handed them out?  Why?  Nobody ever found out.\n\nAll because the company hired incompetent workers in India to save a few bucks.  The company went under a few months later.",

I hated that i was short. This girl A was also a short girl but not shorter than me so she took it as a way to harass me everyday of that year.\n\n\nWhile i was walking with my friends, she would run up to me and measure her height with me and shout out to her friends how she is still taller than me and giggle away. Her friends laughed with her saying 'You are such a meanie.' I felt humiliated but i laughed it off in front of my friends. \n\n\n\nCut to next year I have kinda started accepting the fact I'm short and i can't do anything about it. We have class photos coming up so we line up according to our heights. First being the shortest person. As we were next in line, i was talking with my friends out of the line about something i forgot. A appears out of nowhere and drags me to the front saying ' Saved you your place'. I was just stunned at her behaviour but before I could say anything. The games coach told me move back at the fifth in line. Turns out i grew a bit in a year (I was jogging and exercising with my dad the whole vacation) and was no more the shortest girl. Who took my place? A did. She was pulled out of her self declared place and put in the front.  \n\n\n\nI had a shit eating grin as I looked at the back of her head not moving an inch to look behind cause i would be at her line of sight.

Did that stop me from getting my revenge though? Nope. \n\nI had already told principals and counselors many times about his action and the most they did was give him a stern talking to. I was getting fed up, so naturally, I plotted my revenge. I wasn't known as a bad kid but even though I was small, rumor spread that you did not want to get on my bad side.  I decided to embarrass him in front of the entire 8th grade. \n\nThey gave us cartons of milk, little paper boxes filled with brown, metal tasting milk. One day, I opened my milk and drank half of it. I had eaten all the food on my tray and was heading to the trash cans to dump it. I intentionally walked past this kid and \"tripped,\" so that the milk would pour all over him. He was wearing his wrestling team hoodie (I swear that's like all he wore) and milk got all over it and his pants. I looked like he pissed himself. He stood up and turned around, tears streaming down his face. I was surprised but also satisfied. I loudly apologized and offered to pay for damages so I wouldn't get in trouble. \n\nThe best part of the revenge though was whispering a threat at him. I said something along the lines of, \"Mess with me or my friends again and you'll be crying over more than spilled milk. I may be small, but I can still send even the biggest of bullies crying to their mommies.\" He then ran out of the cafeteria and didn't show up to school for the rest of the week. When he did show up again, he tried to come at me, but I tripped him, and he sprawled on the floor. Needless to say, he didn't bully people after that. Or well, he didn't bully me. Good revenge.",

This day was no different. For some reason, we'd been left alone in a conference room together after the vice principal dealt with us\n\nPart of my bully's punishment was to write an apology letter to the vice principal. He was nearly finished it when he left to go to the washroom\n\nTired of the torment and thinking an insincere letter was too little punishment, I decided I'd try to get him suspended. He'd left his letter on the table, and I was alone in the room\n\nIt's been 20 years so I forget the exact phrasing, but I wrote an explicit sentence (no slurs or anything, just inappropriate language for school) at the bottom of his letter, using his own pencil and mimicking his writing \n\nHe comes back, notices almost immediately, and fetches the VP. When questioned, I play dumb. VP asks me to write some of the non-vulgar words on another page so he can make a comparison. I write them in my own hand, which of course looks nothing like my bully's\n\nTurns out I did a good enough job with the letter to fool the VP. The bully spluttered a bit and fruitlessly tried to convince VP of his innocence \n\nHe did get suspended, and I enjoyed a few days of peace on the playground. Worth it",

I tried talking to him but nothing changed so when friends decided to move to the city and needed to rehome their two maremmas (livestock guardian dogs), I took them in. Neighbour didn't like all the barking but most of the time the dogs were barking at his dogs, who were on the street or in my driveway. I thought it was hilarious because he could control how annoying my dogs were but had to actually deal with his dogs in order to do so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, on day in the winter, I had my dogs out in the backyard of my place. Neighbour's dogs heard my dogs playing with me and came over to check things out. As soon as I yelled at them to \"go home\" my dogs attacked them. It was loud and a bit scary, and I called my dogs off pretty quickly and put them back in their fenced yard. No dogs were hurt but it's been 3 months and the neighbour's dogs have not come back over since! They're still on the road all the time, but they're not chasing and killing my chickens anymore. Maybe they've actually learned their lesson!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Dog tax](https://imgur.com/a/WuqZrM6) because they're awesome.",

That's okay; it happens sometimes. She was fine. But her mom (and somehow, it's always the mom or the aunt) was decidedly not happy, and decided to shit-talk me in Spanish the whole time. \n\n\"Does this woman know what she's' doing? She's pulling nothing but ugly gowns!\" (Said gowns were selected by the bride.) \"I hope you don't ever get as fat as her.\" And so on. Lovely.\n\nNow, I am whiter than a jar of mayo, and I don't necessarily look like I speak Spanish. However, my parents are from a Spanish-speaking country, even though they're not ethnically Hispanic.

I made a point of watching her for a few nights out and my suspicion were confirmed; she was a dirty scrounger!\n\nSo, next time the group went out I spread the word quietly and everyone excluded her from the rounds forcing her to buy her own. On our way home we stopped at a takeaway where they did the most amazing pizzas. I ordered my food but the rest of the team didn’t as per our plan.  As predicted the dirty scrounger didn’t order anything either.\n\nI didn’t open my pizza box on the walk home, instead I said I was saving it til we got back. After signing in we got to the accommodation and I let everyone quickly take a slice of pizza 🍕 but I took the last slice as if to give it to her then promptly threw it in the bin and mixed it with the rubbish, staid how delicious it was but I was. stuffed and couldn’t possibly manage the last slice. The look on her face was priceless😂😂😂\n\nThis continued for a few weeks with the rest of the group until she finally got the message and started coughing up for her own food and drinks.\nWe’ve all been skint as young soldiers but if you’re up front with the team they’ll usually spot you some drinks and food but to continually take the piss out of the team; you’re gonna get taught!",

Douche bag hoarder (65M) did not contact a nurse to come out and teach him or his girlfriend (60F) how to use her feeding tube. She had severely advanced throat and brain cancer. She stroked 3 weeks later. 77 pounds. He admitted it at the hospital. Excuse was no one called him to set up the appointments. She died 5 days later. He refused to allow surviving son a minute alone with her, claiming he just wanted her money and belongings of which she had none. Medical staff removed him from premises after he began yelling calling son a nut-less cocksucker. \n\nBackstory: Douche bag’s brother, adult child murderer, was married to girlfriend. She divorced adult child murderer after youngest child graduated high school due to extreme mental, physical, sexual abuse. 5 years later, child murderer drives across the nation to a national park taking adult child. Sets up a camp deep into the woods off trail. Never returned. 2 years later, surveyor finds the camp site. Adult child’s body was in a shallow grave with some parts scattered due to animal activity. Child murderer was found in tent. Both gunshot wounds to the head. Ruled murder suicide. Douche bag swoops in on vulnerable mom and they eventually develop relationship. \n\nDouche bag currently holds adult child’s ashes refusing to turn them over to family per her will. He also is holding hostage all her belongings. He is a hoarder whose home contains his grandparents’ belongings including clothes. It also contains his mom and dad’s things, and now all of girlfriend’s despite her will and wishes. Yes, family is taking legal action. \n\nSource: Girlfriend is my best friend’s mom. I have watched this all go down over the last 21 years, picking up the pieces each time. I planned murdered child’s funeral. I wrote and spoke the eulogy. I planned girlfriend’s funeral that occurred Sunday. I cooked the food for the family. \n\nRight now, there are MANY, MANY things I want to do to douche bag. The only thing I felt I could do right now without him knowing (and possibly making things worse) was to sign him up for car warranties and health insurance quotes. He is extreme conspiracy theory right wing conservative. I made sure to select for health insurance that he identifies as non-binary. \n\nI have his phone number and address.

This went double if I liked the guy back.\n\nI even have a vivid memory of her straddling my boyfriend in a school stairwell while the three of us were hanging out. Poor guy was so uncomfortable and was the only one who didn't fall for her wiles; he and I are still besties 15 years later.\n\nGoing into university, I started going out with a new group of friends who were really into clubbing. Get a bunch of students drunk and dancing together, and of course, moves will be made. I had no interest in the Chads that came sniffing around, so when they'd ask for my number (after multiple polite rejections), I thought to myself, \"You know who would love this? That girl from HS.\"\n\nSo from then on, whenever I got some pushy guy who just wouldn't take no for an answer, I told them my name was her name and then gave them her number. She always wanted the attention that I received. It just made sense to help her out.",

It’s not going to happen, I’m the only one of us two who does the job and goes above and beyond with it. They need me and only keep her because she has seniority. \n\nShe’s not queen of petty, that belongs to Charlotte Dobre whom I adore. But this woman sure is reaching for that crown! Let’s call her Christina. \n\nI can’t do anything drastic because I don’t have a second job lined up to replace this one. When I do I’ll let everyone know Walmart style 😂 but for now I gotta be subtle, cautious and mindful. The revenge can’t be too huge and unlike Christina, my form of petty usually doesn’t screw me over. I’m a selfish person and I don’t like to risk my comfort or my mojo but I’m absolutely willing to fuck over anyone else who deserves it. Christina on the other hand is happy to get in her own way to mess with people. That makes her petty more lethal than mine. I’m just too selfish to go that far. \n\nI don’t want to hurt her, I just want to inconvenience her. I want some small little victories that make my nights bearable. So please help me out. \n\nThis lady has been messing with me since day one nearly a year ago. She has this shit coming for her. She steals, she lies, she spreads rumors, she’s tried to get me fired more than 6 separate occasions, and she wants me to do all of her work so that she can take credit for it. And now because of her complaints I get to do extra work than before. \n\nI’ve been too nice and too compliant. \n\nBut I don’t want to risk her beating me up in the parking lot (she’s done that to someone else already and because she has seniority she can’t get fired unless she beats up a supervisor or the guy giving us our paychecks). \n\nI’d stick food in her drawers to encourage the infestation of cockroaches inside the walls to crawl into her desk but her desk is next to my desk and that’s a no thank you from me 😂. \n\n(If I could, I would put her stapler in a thing of jell-o). \n\nI recently found out that she overheard a serious issue I was telling the supervisor about. There was a guy who wanted to do more than flirt while on break and I wasn’t comfortable with it so I let the supervisor know so that way I’m covered if something happens. I didn’t give any details of what fully went down because it was necessary. Only the guy and I know what all happened. Well Christina was mad that I didn’t figure out that she was mad at me for two weeks (she didn’t tell me) and decided to spread two separate rumors about me. One was that I was sleeping around at work. That’s not true. And the other was that my flirty acquaintance had forced me to do things, also not true. She then went to the guy and told him that I told her that he forced me into things. So now he’s coming to me in the hallway asking me why I would say that and believing her over me. (Mind you this could get me fired and could get the guy reprimanded. He wouldn’t be fired though because this place is super misogynistic). \n\nSo I am amazingly pissed off. I can’t stoop to her level, she’ll win, I can’t just submit, she’ll win, and I can’t have a show down because she will win. \n\nBut I can take pleasure in her struggling with small tedious little battles. \n\nThis is a 60 year old woman who is known for bullying people because she’s mentally a 16 year old spoiled brat. I’m done being nice. I’m done complying. I am done with rolling with the punches. Standing my ground will not be enough. \n\nSo please I am asking the internet, how can I make this person’s life a little more inconvenient than usual and how petty can we get with it? \n\n(Sorry if this wasn’t the right place I have no clue where else to ask this).",

Everyone  is assigned cleaning responsibilities which have to be done weekly and it's stated in each of our lease agreement.\n\nEveryone who lives or had previously lived here all did their jobs and there had never been issues until this guy, let's call him Aiden, moved in last year.\n\nHe's tasked with the bathroom and the toilet. Since he moved, he's only done his job less than 5 times. All he did was sleep all day. The evidence in the bathroom and toilet couldn't lie. I had to do it for him for many months but you could only do it so long until you had enough. I'd told him in person but he acted defensive and he refused to take accountability. \n\nSo I told the landlord to conciliate and ask him to do his job. In his mind, this mean I started the drama. Since then, he'd give me attitude by slamming the door loudly when he gets in or out of his room/the house. He only does this when the other guy isn't around.\n\nMonths passed he still hadn't done the cleaning. I brought the issue up to the landlord again. This time the landlord sent us the message saying that Aiden promised to do his job weekly. However, he still failed to do so. I know this because I work from home and there's no sign of cleaning in said rooms.\n\nAnother issue is the hairs on the bathroom floor which occur daily. Aiden and I have the same type of hair but mine is the longest so I know when some of those hairs aren't mine. The other guy sheds hairs too but I don't mind because  it's understandable you can leave behind some hairs when you leave the room. When I leave behind soem hairs, I apologize. But I've never seen accountability from Aiden when he does too.\n\nThe other day I came home to see his hairs on the floor but I cleaned them up for him and went about my day. I didn't care enough to take photos because why be petty? Cutting to yesterday, I left a few hairs behind. Aiden sent me photos of my hair. I apologized.  But this time I mentioned his hairs I found. He denied that those were his hairs when it's obvious he'd been home all day and I yied my hair up all the way until bed. He was adamant about turning the tables. The convo went like this:\n\nMe:  Sorry about that. And hey, there were times when I cleaned the toilet, bathroom, and the laundry for you for months when it's not my assigned role. \n\nNobody's perfect and I apologize when I'm wrong. So I hope we can be respectful to each other and help look after the house.  \n\nAiden: I don't need you to educate me. Thx. I cleaned up hairs all the time since I moved in and I didn't say anything. I appreciate your help in the past. But not anymore since you started the drama.\n\nHim trying to gaslight me into believing that he's cleaned up since he moved in is ridiculous. IMO it's not worth responding to him at this point. I brought up the issues to landlord. At the same time I make sure the bathroom is spotless and take photos after every use and document them on Excel so he can't gaslight me.",

        "text": "Trigger warning: he’s a pedophile.\n\nThis story took a few sharp turns as I wrote it. So I had rewrite it several times to not upset people. I cut the story down as short as I can. So I work for a multinational shipping company and my boss was a jerk. I say was because he has been fired and is facing his day in court. So my former boss has been harassing the women in my workplace for quite some time. He would start out slow and I did everything in my power to warn the new women that he is a creep. Allow me to explain how it would go. \n\nWe would get a new woman in our section. He would start by treating her like everyone else. The woman would think we were exaggerating. A week or 2 goes by and he starts with the jokes. They start out harmless then slowly over a month or 2 would get worse and worse. It would get to the point that all jokes were about the naughties. The woman would get uncomfortable and either request a transfer or quit. The later be the more than the former. My work group got a lecture from him about workplace harassment that was mandated by HR. He berated us and told us we are the reason women are quitting. He also told us that we would be fired if it continued. \n\nSo we as a group hatched a plan. We would record him during the shift. I can’t take credit for this as it was our shop steward that suggested it. So we recorded him and after a few weeks we built up a large amount of records up him making dirty jokes and telling guys that he would put our male bits in a vise if we didn’t hurry up. \n\nWe then we found out that he was arrested for have a relationship with a 16 year old. He’s in his 30s. His wife is the one to find out and she went nuclear. She blasted him on facebook and is going to take everything from him. So we did the only thing we could do we handed in a copy of the recordings to the union lawyer and plan on filing a suit for harassment. The wife went nuclear on him so we will take this petty revenge as a consolation prize. Now it would just be insensitive to post this on social media. But we did send his rants about his wife to her. Good luck please ruin his life. \n\nFYI: we don’t want to hurt the company as we all love our jobs and the big bosses. Also it pays very well.",

He met a guy closer to his age and i let them use my extra room to cuddle and be gay 😄 in secret. We can call him JJ. I never got sexual with both, ok. So Broski plays a strong game, cleaning and raking and me teaching him how to drive cause he dont got a license. Im giving and giving as a sugar daddy does i suppose.  Broski gets lazy, works less and fucks more. He has a gf during this time and im fooling around with him randomly. I always tried to give him life clues, Like watch law n order. I always warned him not to jump into court especially eith me as an opponent. After I fire him due to laziness and his mom harassing me because her adult son in his 20s is locked in my house… Broski tries to sue me (currently). So I have to use anything I can in a case like this. I have plenty of evidence to back up my side. I have texts from him and me in a sexual relationship. I also slept with his bf last august. Thats when he sued me 🤣and actually filed. So I used the texts from JJ and I flirting to show the time line of the lawsuit and my pics and texts showing he wasnt working here but hiding from family and fucking around. The bf just saw the evidence i submitted. I feel bad but I have to use anything i can. People are no longer aware that texts can be used in court. The two are still together so I spent my morning sending a bunch of that time period to JJ. Im talking Broski asking me if strangers can come over and trying to use my house as a turn-style. I have pics of him in my bed, i have dick pics and conversation about smelling Broskis nuts😜. I think JJ was digging for my case argument. But i poured the whole tea pot for him (nothing focused on my argument. JJ has seen the pic evidence and is acting like Broski aint home… I cant wait til our hearing date next week. I am so excited. I think i have a solid win.",

        "text": "This is from years ago but I ran into and thought the pettiness would fit right in.\n\nI (f) was very insecure growing up.  I had a small group of friends all the way through High School especially my bestie “Liza”.  She was very beautiful and all the guys liked her.  I, on the other hand was too tall, too skinny, shy and very insecure.  She always dated the guys that I could only dream of dating.  One day a mutual friend told me that when Liza knew that I was interested in a guy she would go all out to get him interested in her.  I didn’t believe the mutual friend.  Liza was my bestie, she wouldn’t do that to me.  It had to be a coincidence, but I was talked into testing it out.  I thought there was no harm because I had faith in her. The next night I told her that I had a crush on “Brad”.  He was the soccer star at our school and had a reputation as  a “love ‘em and leave ‘em” guy that I most definitely didn’t have a crush on. Sure enough, the next week, Liza and Brad were a couple.  I thought back and realized that our mutual friend was right and every time I told her that I liked someone, she ended up with him.  It pissed me off, but I decided to get some revenge before I cut the “friendship” off completely.  I started “liking” bad boys, you know, the guys that smoked and did drugs and barely got by in school.  Sure enough, she started hanging out with the bad boys, drinking and smoking and skipping school.  She ended up pregnant and quitting school, and honestly I felt bad about that, but she made her own choice to be a skanky friend.  \n\nI ran into her last week while I was home visiting my parents.  She never left the small town we lived in, had been divorced 3 times.  I told her that I had always had a crush on her Brother…I wonder what she’s going to do with that.",

This one friend was the prettiest of them all, she was extremely popular and was so perfect,  all the boys fell for her and they followed her around.  She was everything I couldn't be. But I didn't hate her for it, she was relatively nice to me,\n\nTill my last year, we were all together talking and she asks me who I liked in our school. I tell her I liked Josh for a year now and I wasn't pretty enough for him to even notice me. She sounded so nice and reassured me, she's close with josh and will talk me up to him. I started being a bit close with her, over past weeks, she'll come back and tell me josh said this and josh said that about me and he thinks I'm pretty and he liked me, Her talk up was working, I'd send messages through her to him for weeks. But when I'd run into him, it was like, we were strangers, we were talking for weeks but he acted like he didn't know we've been talking for weeks.\n\nAnd when I tell her, she says \"he's just shy\" and I'd believe her. And this went on for more weeks. Till one of my friend told me it wasn't true,  she was doing it as a joke and that they're dating, they've been dating for months. Everyone knew and they kept it an inside joke.\nI was hurt and sad and miserable.  She played it off obviously. \n\nNow I'm in my last year of college and I eventually bloomed and I'm doing better than everyone who saw me as a joke, they're still stuck in the same place, making tiktoks and they all look the same. They constantly message me but I'm so far beyond that.  I look like a completely different person. And that girl stayed the same, she makes tiktoks and I watch them and laugh at how she's the same and still doing the same thing and trends highschoolers are doing. She didn't bloom after her hs bloom, It felt good, I might sound terrible but it felt so good.\n\n\nI pay for tiktok views and promotion on her posts (fake obviously)\nJust to get her excited so she'd post more and think people are actually watching. The more I promote, the more she posts like 6 times a day, and each post is cringier and funnier. she does more trends and it looks worse each day. And it entertains me.",

It probably explained my inabilities to live up to expectations of a masculine man.\n\nAnyhow, I decided to petition the court for judicial recognition of gender identity and a legal name change before filing for divorce.

        "text": "Back in 1998 I moved from Michigan to Virginia and took a job as an irrigation tech for a large regional landscape company. Within 6 months I learned my mistake as working as an irrigation tech for landscapers suck. You are treated as a necessary evil and always get the shitty end of the stick. I had heard through the grapevine that some area managers had screwed up a couple big maintenance contracts and that somehow they were going to try and make me the scapegoat. So I promptly went to the second contractor I had interviewed for originally and got a job there and put in a one week notice.  My manager was really pressuring me to give them more notice until I told him that If he asked me one more time for more notice that he would notice the following morning that I didn't work there anymore. So at the end of the week I turned in my uniforms plus my reimbursement slip for $38 petty cash. I was told that I was getting nothing back on my uniforms and they weren't going to pay my $38. I was pissed but just moved on. The following week I contacted my local labor board and filed a complaint saying that the entire time I had worked for them I was being paid salary while I was a non-exempt employee. I asked to be paid all of my overtime. A few weeks go by and it works its way through the system and I get a call from the corporations Controller. We have a meeting and go over everything with a bunch of back and forth and he was trying to justify that I was really exempt and they didn't owe me anything until I really had enough of his shit. I told him straight up that we might disagree on how much they owe me but I'll guarantee they owe me something. On top of that I would make a point on every payday going from branch to branch of the company with a sign standing  outside the gate telling every single non-exempt employee that they were screwing out of overtime how they could sue the company. I ended up signing an NDA and got a check for 5k the following day. Within 2 months that company and several others in the area began paying what they call Chinese overtime. They take your weekly salary and divide it by 40 for an hourly rate and for every hour of overtime you work you got half your rate. If you work your way through the math and what not and how the labor board determines your overtime in this case, it pretty much worked out correctly.  So in summary, my employer tried to screw me out of $38 and I made them pay me $5,000.",

        "text": "I'm still getting a lot of heat for this but only because of the escalation that occurred today. See, there is a faculty member (let's call her Lola) who is beyond annoying.\n\nWhat makes her so annoying?\n\nWell, she tended to make everybody wait for her. It didn’t help that she was the one responsible for supplying us with what we need our classroom. For example, when you try to get her to do anything or answer a question, she would always say “Oh, give me a moment. I’m so busy” and never gets back to us.\n\nSounds like nothing, right?\n\nWell, when you approach her again, Lola responded with the same response. Eventually, you would get so fed up with waiting for her that you would just figure out the solution on your own only for her to complain that you should have waited for her. And, when you tell her that we got tired of chasing her, Lola would always counter with “I’m just so busy. You must be patient with me.”\n\nThis had been going on for about a few weeks now but I mostly ignored her; I'm self-efficient and usually buy my own things. That was until she got involved in our Starbucks run. Every time we planned a Starbucks run, the process was always the same: we post it in the group, everybody put down their order, and our boss collects and pays. But, every time, Lola would say “Wait, I’m so busy” only not to order anything an hour later. She did this a few more times until I announced that I had enough. My colleagues wanted to know what I was going to do and I told them that I got an idea.\n\nSo, on Monday, I started taking orders. She did her usual antics and I told her that she got ten minutes. She tried to object saying that she was so busy but I stood my ground. Ten minutes later, I ordered. Thirty minutes later, we got our order, and she was fuming. She tried to protest but I told her that I meant what I said. Then, she said that I should have waited for her. I just tilted my head and said, \"Hm\". (African Americans will understand that gesture)\n\nFor the whole week, every time she tried to talk to me, I would just give her usual response (“I’m busy”, “Oh, give me a moment”, and things like that). And I do mean EVERY TIME. Soon, it got to the point where she refuse to talk to me which was fine because, again, I'm self-reliant.\n\nNow, here’s where the real fun begins. My colleagues, on both sides (foreigners and Chinese), started to join in on it, which started to piss her off even more. Nobody wanted to let up even after being spoken to about it. We all just informed him that we're just doing what she's done to us. Then, today, the students (mostly HS students) got involved. I don’t know if they saw what we did or heard about it. All I know is that they started to do it, too, and, being teenagers, they were relentless. Even when she said “Hi” to them, they gave Lola her usual responses. After dealing with this for a week, she finally broke down and cried.\n\nI got called into a meeting with my boss after Lola singled me out. He told me that what I did on the side of cruel and requested that I tried to make amends with her. I refused and countered that she needs to grow up and stop acting like she was more important than she actually is. Right now, we are at an impasse but I have this feeling that I got my point across to Lola.",

He is a pretty chill guy and will always write one without any questions. Around my finals senior year I maybe showed up 4 or 5 times asking for notes. He finally got annoyed and had his first sweet petty revenge. \n\nHe would always jokingly ask me “What are you sick of this time?” And I’d say “Whatever gets me X amount of days of home rest.” Well, that time he wrote that I had an STD, which my teacher awkwardly asked me if I was able to clear.\n\nThis time (grad school) I went for another note and again naively forgot to check what he wrote. I knew he was mad because he was overbooked and overworked since it’s flu season. I had to clear the note with my uni nurse who looked like she saw a ghost when she read it. He had written I had the flu,covid and pneumonia all at the same time and that I needed a single day of rest (Tuesday). She asked me how I am not hospitalised yet and why I was bright and early at uni with such a severe diagnosis. \n\nI told her I really loved going to my lectures but she was just pissed off and send advisory emails to all my professors to keep me out of their classes for a week. \n\nI can’t even be mad. I overuse these notes and my GP knows it. It made me chuckle for a good 10 minutes.",

        "text": "Several years ago I was an assistant manager for a national chain auto parts store (one that everybody knows). Two people were required to open the store each morning. The store opened at 7 a.m. but we were to be inside at 6:30 a.m. to perform the opening tasks. One cold clear morning, me and a coworker arrive at 6:30 and head to the door. Before we even reached the door, this raging lunatic comes  stomping towards us, holding a sack and yelling, \"YOU CLOWNS SOLD ME THE WRONG PART!\" I said \"OK, we'll get you the right one.\" As I was unlocking the door, I could tell he was planning to enter the store with us. Now, here is the first of the petty revenge. I  could easily have let him in and quickly resolved his issue, but for obvious reasons, that was not gonna happen. I told him, \"I'm sorry but customers are not allowed in except during store hours. We open at 7.\"  He replied , \"I'VE GOT A PLANE TO CATCH!\"  The airport he was headed for was Memphis International, a solid 45 minutes away on a good day. During rush hour, it's anyones guess how long it would take. The coworker and I entered and locked the door behind us. The lunatic went back to his car. We completed the opening procedures and I sat in the office, waiting until precisely 7 oclock . At 7, i headed to the door expecting pyscho to be standing there but he wasnt. I looked out and saw him sitting in his car, head tilted back on the seat, asleep - morning sun shining brightly. I chuckled to myself and unlocked the door. Around 7:15, he still hadnt come in and when I looked out, his car was gone, having driven off with his incorrect part and ,hopefully , missing his flight after a stressful rush to the airport.",

He was super freaked out, his reaction was hilarious and all we could do was laugh. We told him it was glue in the end but he kept on nervously glancing at us for the rest of the lesson. Which was a nice change. I don't think he'll be messing with us anytime soon 😅",

        "text": "I (22 yo) male, sued my internship company because they fired me for no reason. It was a start up company. Things were fishy from the beginning, but it was my first internship so I was still naive then. I slowly realized that all the employees (4 lol), were all interns. The person who taught me the job was a fired intern too. Fast forward to a month after, and I get this email from the manager saying that he “feels” that I am not committed to his company. No warnings beforehand was so ever. He said that at the office, I appear slow and uninterested. Little did he know that I carried the whole customer support emails by myself and actually took the time to reply to each one without ignoring it. \n\nAnyway, after I saw the email, I replied and told him that this is not the case and he should give me another chance. He replied and said no. I replied again and lowkey begged him because he was basically screwing my study as an internship is a mandatory part of it. He didn’t reply and ignored me. I asked to have a meeting with him and he ignored me. \n\nSo here is when petty me took over. I wrote a long message calling him a dickhead in professional words. I sent that message in the group chat with the other interns and luckily, a new intern had just joined the company and she saw it. Then he finally replied to me and was like “oh things sometimes don’t work out and it happened to me bla bla bla”.\n\nI didn’t feel fulfilled yet, so I looked at the contract and saw that under termination, it said that a one month notice should be given before termination. He terminated me without the month notice. So then I consulted a lawyer and we filed a lawsuit against him. I didn’t win, but I got a settlement and got some money of out it. I caused him nuance while I lived on and enjoyed my life and got a better internship. He probably had to pay for his lawyer and I also took time off of his work. I couldn’t be happier to see his grumpy face. I sincerely from the bottom of my heart wish that this dude never finds peace.",

        "text": "This is an old story from the first year or two I was living on my own.\n\nAt the time I was living in some pretty terrible apartments in the worst part of town?\n\nIrrelevant, but, \"How bad?\" you ask. Recently a police sergeant told me that he doesn't send his guys out there unless there's at least 3 officers to keep an eye on each other, and a quick response team waiting nearby in case things go south. He said I was lucky not to get shot living there. \n\n**Background**\n\nWell, as it just so happens- my parents were going to go on a cruise, and my place was the midway point between them and their port of departure. (I was 200 miles away, their port was another 200 miles past me). \n\nThey asked if they could drive up to my place, then have me drive them the rest of the way and keep an eye on their car for a week. \n\nI love my parents dearly, so I immediately agreed.\n\nNow, obviously I wasn't going to keep my parents car at **my** apartments for fear of it getting stolen. So, for one *very* uneventful week, I keep my parents car parked on the street by my girlfriend's house.\n\nThe night before going to pick them up from their return, I decide that I wish to skip the car shuffle first thing in the morning, and take my parents car back to my place. \n\nI arrive at my apartment at **1am.** My plans are to wake up at 7am and start the trip back up to their port.\n\nAt this point it is worth explaining a little about my apartment's parking lot. Yes, we did have one parking spot per apartment, they were not assigned, but we were supposed to have stickers in our window to prevent tows. \n\nNow, I'm not really a rule breaker- I normally would never have even *risked* parking there- **BUT** for the **ENTIRE** year I had been living at those apartments, not **ONCE** had a car ever been towed. The overwhelming majority of cars there were broken down and had been in their spots longer than I had lived there.\n\nThe lease *did* allow guests, and it *did* allow people to allow guests to park there for short periods of time. \n\n**I'm sure you can guess what happened next**\n\nI woke up, I brushed my teeth, got dressed, and exited my apartment only to be presented with a *mostly* empty parking lot. The only remaining vehicles in the parking lot are a Tow truck, and the last car being towed out. I panicked and immediately start interrogating the tow truck driver. \n\nNow, I understand, there are few job positions in the world more reviled than tow truck driver- so I was careful to be kinder in the situation than I'm sure he was used too. I beg for information as to where my parent's car is, and when/how it got towed. \n\nTurns out he towed it at 5am, 4 hours after it had parked there.\n\nI call and beg the apartments to help- apparently it's \"not their problem\". I find the tow yard, and seriously contemplate attempting to steal my parent's car back. \n\nI call the tow yard, find out it's about **$450** to get the car back, money I don't really have. The person on the phone is practically gloating as they hear the panic in my voice. They email me the details of the tow and the cost of recovery. \n\nUltimately, I know I'm going to have to eat the $450 to go get my parents, but the entire situation is *infuriating* to me. That's when I look at the pictures in the email they sent me- it includes a very dark and blurry picture of the car. At which point I'm struck with *divine inspiration*. \n\nI grab a water bottle, and drive back to the tow yard. As I get out of my car, I peel off my \"*Plz don't tow me*\" sticker off the inside of my window and stick it to the water bottle. \n\nThe tow yard manager's face was plastered with a sickly sweet \"Oh I'm *so* sorry for your trouble\" look that dripped with false sympathy. I explain that it's my parents car, and that I can prove it with their registration in the glove compartment showing our same last names as well as a picture of me my parents had in the car. \n\nAs I'm grabbing the registration, I kept the manager in my peripherals and when he wasn't looking, I swiftly placed my sticker on the inside of their windshield up where it's shaded to keep sun out of the driver's face.\n\nAs I got out, I called over the tow yard manager and asked for an explanation. I point out the barely-visible sticker from the window and begin taking photos. \n\nWhere the sticker is WOULD be visible to anyone standing in front of it, but would've been practically invisible in a photo unless it was in bright daylight. \n\nThe manager began sweating and called his boss. His boss said that they'd look into it but I still had to pay for the car in the mean time. I talked the yard manager and his boss into agreeing to write in the situation on the written agreement and sign off that they saw the sticker in the yard. \n\nOff I went to collect my parents, I wasn't too late when I picked them up, and I explain the situation on the way back. \n\nI spent the next week badgering the tow company to return my money, which they did after much griping and apologizing.",

        "text": "Another story in the typical area \"Don't mess with the IT guy\", which happened to me 4 days ago. English is not my native language, so my apologizes if you spot some mistakes around here.  \n\n\nI currently work a for a company in France as a technical writer, but I'm in charge of leading some projects linked to the IT service. The latest one was including an ERP, a software designed for logistics, administrative and production fields. Truthfully, we were operating with few tools, using Excel or a company-made software, but our main goal was to harmonize our tools and process. The project itself started a year ago, and it was a bit tense but still stimulating.  \n\n\n10 months ago, we contacted every service in the company, in order to get every request used on the internal &amp; external tools and softwares. To be clear, we use the database daily to feed the KPI, our statistics and so on. Every service has his needs, in terms of results. The marketing service will get a review of our clients, the global trend on a defined period for example.  \n\n\nAlmost everyone answered to our question. They told us if they need some modifications for the upcoming software or even say if it's good as it is. Except one service: logistics. 2 weeks after the initial mail, we didn't receive any words from the logistics. I sent a new mail, to remind them our project and if they would give us the request they use in their daily work. Still no response. 3 weeks after, we already did around 30% of the total work, concerning these requests. I sent a new e-mail to the service, in which I've added that if we have no answer in the upcoming 2 weeks from them, we'll consider that they have no needs and we'll proceed as requested for the project. Guess what? No response.  \n\n\nAt this point of the story, I have to precise something. Each mail sent was to the head of the logistics, while my boss (head of IT) and the project manager were cc'ed.  \n\n\nAnyway, let's jump until the last week. In order to have the minimal impact for the company, we have decided to do the migration during the week-end, Sunday precisely, as only few people would work that day (only for urgent calls). We've done the work, installing the ERP, teaching everyone how to use it, doing many hours of testing and even simulating some scenarios. We converted every request, even for the logistics, and the ERP works as intended (for those who did a migration-like work, you certainly know how stressful it is, and how miraculous it is when your environment works at the first try, in the real production area).  \n\n\nThis Monday, we've received a ticket in which an operator from the logistics doesn't know why all their requests doesn't work anymore. The ticket was created with a \"critical\" status, meaning that his whole service can't work anymore. We were a bit surprised at the beginning, but the shocking fact was the email sent by the head of logistics right after the ticket, demanding that we work on it ASAP.  \n\n\nThe thing is, when I saw his name and the word \"request\", I connected the dots and found my old mails sent to him. Furthermore, my boss told him through Microsoft Teams that he told him Sunday the request are done and the location to download them.  \n\n\nI had the pleasure take the action on the ticket, and I've answered to his mail:  \n\n\n\"Dear \"X\" (head of logistics),  \n\n\nI'm a bit surprised that you asked that kind of work now. Indeed, as you may see in the attachments, I've contacted you 3 times previously to ask you if you had some demands about requests you use, but you've never answered me once, and as the last mail says, we've considered that you had nothing to ask.  \n\n\nBesides, \"Y\" (my boss) told you yesterday through Teams that we did the requests and they're available at this address. You'll find these requests in attachment too, so your service will be able to work as expected.  \n\n\nFeel free to give us your feedback, if it works or if you have a problem on it.  \n\n\nBest regards,  \n\n\n\"Z\" (me).\"  \n\n\n5 minutes after the mail was sent, the ticket went into the \"resolved\" status by itself. I wonder why...  \n\n\nOh, and this story is written 4 days after, because it doesn't end on that ticket.  \n\n\nIt seems the head of logistics did a hidden cc, to the president of our company. In fact, we didn't have a clue at first when we sent our answer, but during the afternoon, the president himself sent a mail saying the following words:  \n\n\n\"X,  \n\n\nI don't get why I'm into this conversation. However, seeing the development, I'm disappointed in you, how you act and how late you are on this project that we talked this morning during our meeting (we have a strategy meeting each monday morning).  \n\n\nDo you retain informations? You know how we despise that kind of behaviour. I'm expecting a big change of mindset from you. And you know that the company has already various experienced profiles, in the logistics field too.  \n\n\nZ, my apologizes to the services.\"  \n\n\nYesterday, HR sent a global mail promoting the new ERP , but a paragraph about communication and how important it is, was added in the message. I hope someone read carefully that message...  \n\n\nIn short, stop messing with the IT service. We do our best to provide a good experience with your hardware and software, even if sometimes it's a bit hard or totally new. So when you see a problem, or if the IT guy or woman ask you something, don't wait and act.",

        "text": "\nSo basically my ex and I had been together for 13 plus years but in 2019 she got prego with my twins two boys at first thing were good we were living together and her parents (both no eglish) lived with us and her sister . I work from home so I spend most of the days with the boys with her mom who would help and I would stay over when I’m not working but I’m pretty much there every days to be with the boys . We also have a car together but is in her name and I pay the monthly (this with be relevant later )\n\nso Fast forward about 2 years my now ex not sure exactly what her issues was but she wasn’t talking to me much and wasn’t wanting to see me so I’d just come over during the day and leave at night and go to my other home . So a few months go by and her mom starts yelling at me in her language and copying what I say so I tell her to be quite and stop I guess her sister heard that and told my ex so my ex and I started fighting about other things and she told me she doesn’t want me there so I left . So next day I text my ex and say I want to see the boy she says no I say well you can’t keep my kids from me . She said she filled a restraining order and want to wait till we go to court . I said no you aren’t even home I want to see my kids when u are not home so finally I got her to let me see them a few days a week when she wasn’t home . \n\nA week or so later I get mail from courts saying her restraining order was denied . But the courts set a court date ,she got a lawyer I didn’t because I didn’t do anything wrong and I knew this !!!!. She was just lying and trying to keep the kids and get 100 percent control of the kids so after months of me seeing my kids less and less and at one point I got tired of her being in control I told her I was picking them up and taking them to my the parks by my place ,she knows where I live and is only about 15 mins away from her she texted me to ask me when I was bring the kids back I said I’ll bring them back tomorrow she freaked out and came over and called the cops and nothing happened beside her screaming saying I took her kids and I have text saying what I’m doing with them and what I was going to be doing . \n\nOk back to the petty revenge so After the restraining order was denied and she got a lawyer she want to take it to trial and again was denied so I gained 50/50 with no lawyer and she spent so much to get one to try and keep me away ok remember the car well she then tries suing me for the payments because I paid in cash and she said I didn’t pay her but the car was in her name  nothing in my name but she never got the key when she took the plates off the car and had it towed so she ended up winning  that case I hand to pay her 500 because she had to get a new key but I won 50/50 and set time with the kids .after months of not being with the kids .I was able to file for child support and now she will have to pay me monthly after all the mean things she did her and her sister and the Missed time with my kids so that is my petty revenge sorry for typos it’s 1am ........",
