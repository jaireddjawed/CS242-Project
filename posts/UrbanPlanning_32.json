Community and Social Planning\n\nI tried to find more info on each career and day on the life of each person but have come up with nothing substantial.\n\nI am leaning more towards Economic Development, Sustainable land use, and Transportation.

        "text": "Googling has only given me a few pools and Chinese hotels.\n\nMy city of Lexington, Ky has a burgeoning district, the Distillery District, which is rapidly spurring adaptive reuse in the surrounds. This reuse, however, will quickly run into a [giant stone quarry](https://www.google.com/maps/@38.0417554,-84.5193131,1853a,35y,38.92t/data=!3m1!1e3). \n\nI'm just wondering if there are other cities that have run into this, and if they've been able to positively reintegrate Quarries or repurpose them- aside from the huge task of filling them in. What would y'all do with a quarry in an area that is seeing massive new investments in bars, restaurants, retail, etc. with a huge rails to trail project running along the property?",

However as much as I search on Google, I can't find any diagrams of how this works, or explanations of a prototypical example, or examples of specific addresses I should look up in Google Maps so that I can get a sense of what actually is going on.\n\nThe vague descriptions of these urban developments sound like they could just be describing the classic postwar US hierarchical streets suburban subdivisions, which also have very limited entry and exit for cars and thus create quiet tertiary streets that people can easily walk and bike on, if those US subdivisions just added walking and cycling entrances and exits all around the subdivision (instead of only being able to walk/cycle in and out of the same entrance as the cars). However I know that obviously isn't the case, I am sure there are many more distinctions.\n\nI am also interested to learn how the Dutch address the commuting hours traffic implications of only having on car entrance/exit to a neighborhood, and relatively limited networks of through streets: doesn't that create traffic backups, like it does for subdivisions in the US? In the US, it is said that having open street grids like in 19th century US cities is much better for traffic management than having these closed off subdivisions since people have dozens of street options to take to their destination.\n\nWhere can I learn more about Dutch urban planning regarding these sorts of topics? Anyone have a diagram of a \"typical\" Dutch neighborhood in a city?",

        "text": "As someone who is searching for a new job, I've unfortunately had to turn down a couple jobs in places that were absolutely shit in quality, to the point where these areas were losing jobs and even modern conveniences.  Some of these places were even about to lose their hospital, or at least vulnerable to losing it.  I feel guilty, however, leaving these people to their own devices, and essentially turning down a chance to help out these cities so that they do not lose what they so desperately need.  \n\nFor me, it's not so much helping the built environment, but helping the people in the environment themselves.  In my view, some places themselves are simply beyond saving.  So in my view, a possible solution would be to allow the people previously living in these areas to relocate to an area where adequate resources are available.\n\nWhat would be some good ways that allow vulnerable populations to move out of their original location and into new locations?  The only think I could think of is financial government support.",

However, even though I have (technically unrelated) work experience and good test scores, I'm nervous that my undergrad grades will keep me from getting into a decent program.  (as in people actually graduate in a timely manner and get jobs, networking opportunities, etc.) \n\nSo what if I don't get in? Would extra undergrad classes matter? Is there a way to 'sneak in' to the profession? What's a good Plan B?",

Most of the universities in the US have ended already, so it's a disadvantage to hire me because am able to work almost a month less.\n\nIf I still have time to apply for urban planning\\-related jobs in the U.S., what/where are my best options?
