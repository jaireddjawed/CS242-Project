        "text": "As there seems to be a bit of a rise in badhistory surrounding World War Two armored vehicles, I have taken it upon myself to right this great injustice. This will be split into a few sections, because I'm going to max out the character count at some point. \n\n**Wehrabooism**\n\nWheraboos, as many of you may well know, are ~~neonazis~~ people with a distinct love of Teutonic armored vehicles. This is a particularly virulent form of second-option bias, because it is encouraged by the media and popular histories of the war, to show the Americans as underdogs, because who doesn't root for the underdog? Additionally, stereotypes about German engineering go a long way to explaining these beliefs about the Nazi's tanks; people equate them to the BMW and Mercedes of tanks, when they were more like the Trabant and Wartburg: under-powered, dangerous, and flammable. The M4 Sherman did have its flaws -- the suspension was suboptimal, and it could not neutral-steer or pivot, but it got the job done and was well-suited to the American manufacturing style, which in turn was well-suited to mass production. The Nazi style of design and production was so corrupt that it is amazing that it even functioned, let alone was expected to produce products on time, en masse, and within budget constraints. \n\nThere are a few main groups, roughly analogous to the vehicle they like the most. I will focus on the Panther, Tiger I, and Tiger II in this piece, along with a defense of the M4 Sherman. Next time, when I have the required books in front of me, I will be doing the T-34 family, the T20 series, British tanks, and some doctrinal stuff. \n\n**A general note: All engines are *gasoline* unless otherwise stated.**\n\n** 1: PzKpfW V Panther**\nThe Panzer V, or Panther, looks really cool. It has an immensely thick and quite sloped glacis plate, 80mm at 55 degrees. It was theoretically quite fast, and had a pretty good^tm gun. \n\nUnfortunately, the aforementioned armor tended to have the welds burst and to spall heavily when hit with anything larger than a 75mm projectile, and would fail catastrophically if hit by an 85mm or larger projectile, especially 105/122/152mm HE shells. \n\nIt also tended to set itself on fire. A lot. The carbeuretors bowls would overflow, spraying gasoline into the sealed engine compartment, adding to a volatile mix of engine oil and fuel from the leaky fuel and oil lines that was perpetually sloshing around the engine compartment, with the 400-500 degree exhaust system. \n\nThe Panther also, because the drivetrain was designed for a 30-35 ton tank and used on a 45 ton tank, it tended to destroy the final drives, which transmit power from the transmission to the track drive sprockets, in about 350km. The reason for this is not so much poor metallurgical quality, as is the case with the armor, but the seeming incapability of Germany to produce [double-herringbone gears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sB8Gc_ddXNo), which place the load over more teeth (this video is from an M4 Sherman's final drive), and thus make the gear able to handle more torque. \n\nNow, the gun. That big gun, while excellent for killing tanks, was terrible at:\n1. Close-in fighting: It's way, way too long, and tended to break when bonked into things, rendering the whole tank useless. \n2. Infantry support: It had a less effective HE round than the 7.5cm KwK L/48. \n3. Rapid target acquisition: The gunner has a three degree field of view. The commander may have pretty good vision, but he must get the gunner to within three degrees of the target, effectively like trying to talk someone on to looking at a specific tree in a forest through a drinking straw. \n4. Firing on the move: The gun was not stabilized, unlike that of every single M4 Sherman ever built. \n\nThe side armor was about 40mm thick, and was vulnerable to antitank rifles, like the PTRS-41, which was laughably ineffective against anything particularly modern, save for most German tanks.\n\nNow, on to a bigger kitty: \n\n**2. PzKpfW VI Ausf. E Tiger I**\n\nThe Tiger I is a breakthrough tank, designed to punch through enemy lines. It is a box of steel on tracks with a damn big gun. The engine also tended to overheat and set itself on fire frequently, and the armor, the much vaunted armor, apparently so thick that it would survive everything from 75mm to 90mm to 16\" gunfire, depending on who you ask, was actually penetrated by 75mm armed M4 Shermans at ranges of 1,000 yards. Whoops. \n\nThe sights have the same problem as those of the Panther, and of every German tank; the gunner can not see anything outside his sight, and the commander must talk him on to the target, which is hard enough when you're not getting shot at. \n\nThe Tiger is also not a very fast tank, and has a fragile drivetrain. All in all, it gets blown up out of proportion because it looks like what a five year old thinks a tank does; a big box with a little box with a biiiiiiig gun on top. \n\n**3. PzKpfW VI Ausf. B Tiger II**\n\nThe Tiger II is like the Panther and the Tiger having some sort of hitlerite hate-child, which manages to take the bad parts of both and intensify each. The gun is way to long, the drivetrain overburdened, the vehicle too large, and the armor still tended to spall and shatter even if not penetrated. The gun is overrated, because it is impossible to use in cities, and the weight absurd.\n\n\n**4. A Defence of the M4 Sherman:**\nThe M4 Sherman is a brilliant tank, especially in the M4A3 variant. The M4's designation is based on the engines; A1 is powered by the R975 radial engine, A2 by the GM 6046 diesel engine, A3 by the Ford GAA V8, A4 by the Chrysler A57 multibank engine, and A6 by the Caterpillar D200A Diesel radial. \n\nFirstly, the M4 Sherman was not a fireprone deathtrap that was going to eat your babies and make your girlfriend leave you for a guy named Jodie. It was actually, thanks to the usage of properly designed carburetors and fuel lines, as well as the formulation of American propellants and shell filler, less prone to fires than practically any German tank. \n\nSherman also incorporated sufficient armor; it was not designed to slug it out for hours on end, taking hit after hit. Such a tank would be extremely heavy, and therefore useless in the expeditionary role that the US required their vehicles to operate in. Incorporating slope, the armor on the Sherman is about 94mm thick, only 10mm shy of the vaunted Tiger's 104mm. The steel was also much more protective; instead of shattering, it tended to deform much more before allowing the projectile through, absorbing much of the energy of the projectile. It was also very, very survivable; Shermans had the lowest crew mortality rates of the main combat vehicles of World War Two. \n\nThe guns were damn fine. The M3 75mm, a descendant of the French 75, was capable of knocking out a Tiger at a Kilometer, while the M1A2 76mm was capable of wiping the floor with all comers. Not only were they very good, ballistically, but they were gyroscopically stabilized, which gave theoretically 80% of the accuracy of standing still while moving over medium ground at 15 miles per hour. Realistically, it allowed you to keep the sight on target, but shooting while moving was not yet feasible. \n\nThe sights, while not as clear or as heavily magnified as those of the Germans, had a much wider field of view, and the gunner was equipped with a unity periscope, basically an unmagnified wide-angle sight sticking through the top of the turret that allowed him to actually see the target, with a reticle indicating where the telescope is. This allowed the commander to find targets while the gunner was looking for them, and according to tests conducted by the US Army and documented by R. H. Hunnicutt in \"Sherman: A History of The American Medium Tank\", firing first more often than not resulted in victory. \n\nWhile it was built in mass numbers, the M4 Sherman was the best strategically-minded tank of World War Two. It was better than anything the Germans had to offer be sheer sake of not breaking down every 350km. It was demonstrated to be better then T-34/85 in Korea, and comparative testing by US Army Ordinance in 1944 demonstrated it to be better than anything the British had. \n\nAlso, the Ronson slogan \"Lights first time, every time\" is from the mid '50s, and therefore anachronistic. \n\nSources:\n*Panzer Tracts 5-1, 5-2, 5-3*, Jentz and Doyle\n\n*Sherman: A History of The American Medium Tank*, R.

However with the release of the new film Fury, which portrays the Sherman as woefully outmached by the PzKfw.VI(e). \n\n&gt;Most tanks at the time ran on diesel, a safer and less flammable fuel than gasoline. The Sherman’s powerplant was a 400-horsepower gas engine that, combined with the ammo on board, could transform the tank into a Hellish inferno after taking a hit. All it took was a German adversary like the awe-inspiring Tiger tank with its 88-millimeter gun. One round could punch through the Sherman’s comparatively thin armor. If they were lucky, the tank’s five crew might have seconds to escape before they burned alive. Hence, the Sherman’s grim nickname—Ronson, like the cigarette lighter, because “it lights up the first time, every time.”\n\nLet's be frank. It wasn't. Here is a report from a Major Elston, of the Tank Destroyer Board, in January 1945, responding to a request explaining the apparent superiority of German Armor:\n\n&gt;1. The fact that German tanks are generally heavier than ours has evidently led some writers to the assumption that \"heavier\" means \"better.\" But the biggest tank isn't necessarily the best. Carnera was bigger than Dempsey. The best tank is the winning tank.\n\n&gt;2. If size were a gage of worth, then German Ferdinand would be the best tank on Earth. Actually, this sluggish monster seldom could make more than 8 miles an hour off roads and has now gone out of production.\n\n&gt;3. The Tiger, weighing 56 tons, (62 tons in action) and the Panther, weighing 46 1/2 tons, both carry an 88mm gun and from 102mm to 120mm of hull armor. They are less maneuverable than either US medium tanks or US self-propelled Tank Destroyers. To date in all theaters, encounters between German tanks and our self-propelled Tank Destroyers show a score which consistently favors our own equipment\n\n&gt;4. As an example, XII Corps has just reported the overall score of their seven TD Battalions against German tanks of all sizes to 2 Nov 44. This score is:\n\n&gt;No. of German tanks destroyed by TDs - 125\n\n&gt;No. of TDs destroyed in same actions - 25\n\n&gt;Ratio: 5 to 1 in our favor\n\n&gt;5. Above comparison is fairly typical of other reports. This hardly represents a \"disgraceful situation of armament inferiority\". Recommend that Senator Johnson stop beating his breast long enough to explain why, if German equipment is so superior to ours, it has been steadily retreating ever since El Alamein? How does he explain the ability of our \"shockingly inferior\" equipment to chase all German armor out of Africa, Sicily, Italy and France?\n\n&gt;6. Actually, medium armor was a wise choice for us, instead of heavy armor, because we had to land on hostile beaches in all four countries. Sixty ton tanks weren't practical for such landings. The Germans, being at home and with no amphibious operations in sight, were able to use their giants. Being bigger than our mediums, naturally they can mount bigger guns. Their thick armor is at the expense of mobility and would have been mill stones about our necks at Omaha Beach.\n\n&gt;7. Note that the statement which \"aroused\" Senator Johnson is that German tanks are \"heavier, better armored, and better gunned. In this the adjective \"better\" is loosely used - praises all the virtues of weight and fails to damn its disadvantages.\n\n&gt;8. Statement that American guns are too light to knock out heavy German tanks without excessive losses is not true. (See both of the TD Brigade reports by General Ernst)\n\n&gt;9. Statement that German 88mm gun is equal or superior to any American gun is true. Firing either their 3220 f/s with 22.4 lb. projectile (now in use) or their 3775 f/s 16-lb. cored projectile (probably still in development) this gun develops a muzzle energy of 3,500,000 ft/pds. Our own 90mm guns, firing either our existing 2840 f/s with 24.1 lb projectile or our 3900 f/s cored projectile (still in development) develops only 3,050,000 ft/pds. However, a similar comparison between our 76mm gun and the German 76.2mm gun shows a distinct superiority to our weapon.\n\nFury also uses Belton Y. Cooper's sensationally named \"Death Traps\" as a source for the efficacy of the Medium Tank M4. There is, however, an issue with this. As Nicolas Moran, the historical advisor for World of Tanks (who is quite fun to read, and knows how to dig through archives quite well) \n\n&gt;\"**Death Traps is not a reliable source. Don't cite it. Or the History Channel show based on it.**\"\n\n&gt;Here's the issue: Death Traps is a memoir, not a researched historical work. These are the recollections and perceptions as the man saw them, recited some 50 years after the fact. This leads us to two problems:\n\nHonestly. Belton Cooper was a damned mechanic, never saw battle, and the only evidence of battle he saw was broke-ass Shermans returning, while all the good, working Shermans were happily killing Hitlerite bastards. It's a book written in 1998, be a Lieutenant who talks as if he understands the machinations of Generals. This book is trash. The article not so much, but for god's sake, please PLEASE let people know about this foolishness.\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://worldoftanks.com/en/news/pc-browser/21/The_Cheiftains_Hatch_Sherman_PR_Bigger_Cooper/ (Yes, I borrowed heavily from this. So sue me.

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2k21om/the_birth_of_the_deadliest_ideology_in_history/",
        "text": "Ok, so I got directed to [this website, Victims of Communism by](http://victimsofcommunism.org/) /u/firedrops. Anyway, I went to their page [the Legacy of Communism](http://victimsofcommunism.org/mission/legacy-of-communism/), and this hos some terrible history.\n\n&gt; In October 1917, the Bolshevik Revolution gave birth to the deadliest ideology in history – Communism. In less than 100 years, Communism has claimed more than 100 million victims. Today, it continues to rule one-fifth of the world’s people.\n\nThe Bolshevik Revolution did not create the ideology of communism. Communism is older than 1917. Communism even precedes Karl Marx, such as [Joseph Déjacque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_D%C3%A9jacque) or [Moses Hess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Hess). Even earlier than them, [the Diggers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diggers) are arguably proto-communists. Heck, many communists *opposed* the Bolsheviks, *even at the time of the 1917 revolution*. [Rosa Luxemburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_Luxemburg), for example, wrote *in 1904* the article [\"Organisational Questions of the Russian Social Democracy\"](http://libcom.org/library/leninism-or-marxism-rosa-luxemburg), which would later be republished as \"Marxism vs Leninism\" in which she critiqued Lenin and the degree of centralism he proposed, saying, for example,\n\n&gt; The Social Democratic movement is the first in the history of class societies which reckons, in all its phases and through its entire course, on the organization and the direct, independent action of the masses.\n\n&gt; Because of this, the Social Democracy creates an organizational type that is entirely different from those common to earlier revolutionary movements, such as those of the Jacobins and the adherents of Blanqui.\n\n&gt; Lenin seems to slight this fact when he presents in his book (page 140) the opinion that the revolutionary Social Democrat is nothing else than a \"Jacobin indissolubly joined to the organization of the proletariat, which has become conscious of its class interests.\"\n\n&gt; For Lenin, the difference between the Social Democracy and Blanquism is reduced to the observation that in place of a handful of conspirators we have a class-conscious proletariat. He forgets that this difference implies a complete revision of our ideas on organization and, therefore, an entirely different conception of centralism and the relations existing between the party and the struggle itself.\n\n[Emma Goldman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Goldman), communist and anarchist, opposed it to, writing to her niece, \"I could never in my life work within the confines of the State, Bolshevist or otherwise.\" and later publishing a book entitled [\"My Disillusionment in Russia\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Disillusionment_in_Russia) about how much she didn't like what the Bolsheviks did in Russia that was published in 1923. [Otto Rühle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_R%C3%BChle), a prominent communist contemporary to the Bolshevik revolution, wrote in 1920 \"Moscow And Us\" in which he said,\n\n&gt;  Russia is still a long way, by many miles, from communism. Russia, the first country which has arrived at revolution and conducted it victoriously to the end, will be the last country to arrive at communism.\n\n&gt; No absolutely not, the Third International is not a communist International!\n\n[Eduard Bernstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduard_Bernstein), a communist, wrote, in 1922 [\"On the Russian and German Revolutions\"](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bernstein/works/1922/xx/rusgerrev.htm), saying,\n\n&gt; On November 7, 1917, there was a typical coup d’état which, I think, can be defined as ‘a revolution’ only in the sense of those acts of violence in Asiatic countries resulting in the change of a regime without any regard of the final issue of such acts. In its essence it was a rebellion which was effected with the assistance of the rough, politically uneducated soldiery – a rebellion against the Revolution and against revolutionary events. The Revolution was killed by a despotic party, which was able to retain power by means of a military dictatorship. And if during these last five years until this day the Communist Party does not permit freedom of action to any political party Socialist or capitalist one sees in this very fact the tragedy of the position of this Party, because this fact bears evidence of its inner weakness.\n\nSo, yeah, not only did the Bolsheviks not invent communism, they were opposed by many communists at the time.",

        "text": "Good morning everyone! I hope you've got those livers primed and ready to go, because they've got a whole new day to look forward to! To start off the day, I recommend we all uncap the nearest bottle of scotch and take a look at some [Nazi apologetics](http://np.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2jz4zh/cmv_i_believe_the_nazi_army_during_ww2_was_not/), fresh from /r/changemyview.\n\n\n\n&gt; I'm not from Western Europe but I've seen on reddit and also while living in France that people seem to still be quite obsessed with WW2 and keep the same mentality as if the war had ended 2 years and not 70 years ago. The nazis were evil, those fighting against them were heroes. You must believe that nazism was the worse thing that ever happend in history, otherwise you're a nazi apologist so you're evil.\n\n\n\nMan, that globe-changing event that completely rewrote the geopolitical map, birthed the rise of two superpowers, and completely changed the scales of power across the globe into the present day was so long ago there are still many people who were alive during it? Jeez, why're we so preoccupied with it?\n\n\n\n&gt; I believe nazism isn't inherently evil,\n\n\nOh boy. Look, even if you remove the whole 'started world war II' from Nazism you still don't get a pretty rose. It was a highly nationalistic ideology that unified people by making common scapegoats from innocent groups (Jews, Bolsheviks, Roma, non-aryan, Slavs, etc) and ultimately was designed to push people towards war based on racial beliefs. That's pretty damn evil by itself, as bad as any other form of colonial Imperialism. So even if you remove the bulk of the horrific acts Nazism did (which is fucking stupid anyway) [they still were not nice people.](http://www.holocaust-education.dk/baggrund/nazismensideologi.asp)\n\n\n\n\n&gt; it's an ideology that had its place in that moment of history, nationalism, antisemitism and the belief that the white race is superior were very common beliefs during the 19th and beginning of 20th century.\n\n\n\nTrue, none of these things in and of themselves were particularly new to Europe. Pogroms in Russia at the beginning of the 20th century, the Protocols of Elders of Zion hoax, all part of a rising belief in Europe that Jews -not just as a religion- were all beneath good Christian Europeans and were all involved in some international economic powerplay. \n\n\n\n\n&gt; Also, the atrocities that the German army commited are similar to those commited by other armies in other wars.\n\n\n\nOkay. Well. This might be edging on holocaust olympics, and while I fear the wrath of the Moratorium I would like to point out the bullshit in this. First off I agree that the Holocaust -in broad terms- wasn't exactly unique. Government-sanctioned extermination of other groups isn't entirely new, I point to the [Armenian Genocide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Genocide) for that. But the implication OP is making in his view is that what the German army did doesn't really stand out in the history of warfare and that it's blown out of proportion by the west. This would mean that either the German army didn't commit much in the way of atrocities [(Myth of the clean Wermacht)](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2byfzw/just_following_orders_the_myth_of_the_clean_and/) or that for most of warfare's history, large industrialized methods of racial extermination were just sorta the norm. \n\n\n\n\nAnd this is the meat of the lousy history. I cannot recall any other armies that operated like the Nazi's did in occupied territory. Yeah there was the usual rape and pillaging -especially against the Slavs- but what really stands out are things like the [Einsatzgruppen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einsatzgruppen), and of course the network of dedicated death camps that were designed to exterminate the majority of the nonhuman population. Even the Mongols who were notoriously brutal in their conquests didn't keep mass-murdering after the conquest was done. \n\n\n\n\n&gt; The only reason why nazism is seen as the symbol of evil nowadays is because the US fought against them in WW2 and the US wants an image of \"saviors of the world\". \n\n\nRight, I forgot how the US completely controls the world media and dictates their perception on everything. That must be why Nazism is denounced from Washington to Tokyo. \n\n\n\n\n&gt; So basically, the whole western world is still under influence of war propaganda from 70 years ago and can't consider nazism with objectivity.\n\n\n\n\n&gt;  and can't consider nazism **with objectivity.**\n\n\n\n&gt;  consider **nazism with objectivity.**\n\n\n\n\n&gt;  **with objectivity.**\n\n\n\n\n&gt;  **nazism.** **objectivity.**\n\n\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n\n\nI-I'm not sure- what? Is this implying we've been giving the Nazi's a bad rep for kickstarting the most destructive war in human history *and* one of the most horrifying genocides ever? Is he implying we've overlooked something? That perhaps the Nazi's were misunderstood? Or that they didn't do all we said they did?\n\n\n\n\nOr maybe he's implying it's time for a drink. ",

A good way to avoid frustration is to pretend all these comments are being said by this [lady](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCJVu-lGXIg). *You think the Nazis were evil? Well they had ten toes.  You have ten toes. Who's evil now Seth?*\n\nAlso someone says this: \n\n&gt; I'm being bombarded by white knights with no knowledge of history pounding me with their Saving Private Ryan understanding of WWII, so if I confused you with one of those 100 in my inbox, my apologies.    \n\nLol.\n\nAs for the actual history, I want to focus on some misconceptions that came up regarding the German occupation of France as exemplified here:\n\n&gt; The French got along with the Germans very well, actually. They weren't monsters, and a lot of French volunteered in German units to fight \"the Bolshevists\". They were well behaved, and very respectful.\n&gt; \n\nAnd here:\n\n&gt; It's not surprising because the Wehrmacht soldiers had orders to be nice and correct. (in France)\n\nFirst off, the whole idea is a lovely example of cognitive dissonance, you cannot be a aggressive invading and occupying army and be *nice*.  But the Wehrmacht didn't even try to be nice (for a brutal invading army).\nFrom the get-go, Germany was determined to exploit France and boy did it ever.  \n\nFor starters, Germany actually taxed France severely for the occupation, in 1943 the cost was 55% of the French GDP.  This, in addition to straight up looting where an estimated 154 billion francs worth of French machinery, art and other assists was sent to Germany over the course of the war.  Germany also instituted severe rationing, starting in August 1941, each French adult was given a ration card entitling them to only 1,200 calories of food per day.\nMore insidiously, Germany also conscripted French people into what was essentially slave labor. Starting with POWS, Germany eventually expanded to include coerced civilians as well.  In August 1944, about 1,200,000 Frenchmen (little more than half civilian) were laboring in German factories and on German farms.  This amounted to about 10% of France's entire labor force.  \n\nOf course, the German army was also killing civilians in France as well.  There were the massacres of course: Wormhoudt, Ascq, Oradour-surGlane, Maille etc. Ascq is a good case study, in April 1944 a German military train was briefly stopped when a small charge detonated on the tracks.  The SS soldiers dismounted and went on a rampage shooting 84 locals. Ultimately, the German government never prosecuted any of the soldiers for their actions. \n\nViolence also occurred as part of occupation strategy: Hostage taking.\nThe basic idea was Germany would hold some French citizens hostage, and would execute said hostages in response to acts of resistance.  The shooting of Colonel Fritz Hotz in 1941, for instance, led the execution of 48 hostages.  The hostages varied by locality, but the German authorities preferred Communists and Jews, early on at least.  \n\nThis brings me to my final point.  The German treatment of the French people was brutal and violent but it paled in comparison to what became of France's Jews, Romani and mentally handicapped.  At least 75,000 Jews were deported East where most of them died, while about 15,000 of France's 40,000 Romani perished.  The mentally handicapped also suffered tremendously, a post-war study estimated between 40,000-48,000 avoidable occurred in mental hospitals due to starvation and indifference.  \n\nSo yeah.  The German occupiers were not well behaved, not respectful and certainly not nice.  Also they killed Marc Bloch so fuck 'em.",

        "text": "So [this] (http://emgn.com/entertainment/25-of-the-most-evil-people-the-world-has-ever-seen-the-things-they-did-are-absolutely-disgusting/) showed up on my facebook feed. Beyond the ridiculous idea of deciding which murdering bastard was more evil, which is about as subjective as it get, there's a whole bunch of bad history contained here.\n\nSo, without further ado, let's begin:\n\n\\#25 Elizabeth Bathory\n\nSo the article claims that she murdered 650 girls and bathed in their blood in order to keep her skin clear. Besides that being a terrible skin cleanser, that story didn't actually appear until after her death, and chances are she didn't actually kill that many people and the numbers were exaggeration.\n\n\\#23 &amp; 22 Mengele and Heydrich\n\nWell, I guess Nazis should show up here. Makes sense. A little light on the details but still.\n\n\\#21 bin Laden\n\nTerror is pretty much not cool, so pretty evil, but the article claims that Pearl Harbor was a terror attack, which makes no sense. The attack was expressly on the Pacific Fleet, to knock out it's capabilities and try to head off a long war and shorten it. And then especially since a terror attack is an attack on civilians, and fewer than 100 civilians were killed compared to over 2000 servicemen.\n\n\\#20 Saddam Hussein\n\nYeah, he was pretty terrible. Massacring Kurds is not a nice thing to do. Did you know he also had a [Quran written in his own blood] (http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/19/saddam-legacy-quran-iraqi-government)? Yeah, pretty nasty.\n\n\\# 19 &amp; 18 Himmler and Eichman\n\nMore Nazis! Yay! I suppose the Nazi's were some pretty right bastards. Kind of curious though how in all the other cases it's the leader who is on the list, and not any of the henchmen. Nazis are just really fun to talk about I suppose.\n\n\\#16 Kim Il-Sung\n\nApparently he makes this list for starting the Korean War. As opposed to having work camps or political prisoners, or cutting off NK from the world. I mean, Kaiser Wilhelm doesn't even make this list, and he was fairly responsible for WW1.\n\n\\#15 Ayatollah Komeini\n\nYeah, he led the coup that overthrew the shah and imposed some strict religious laws, but we just point out that Iran has been one of the more stable countries in the region. And seriously? He was worse than the Shah? That dude had secret police murdering people left and right; his people legitimately hated him.\n\n\\#14 Hirohito\n\nWell, let's just say we aren't even really sure how much of a direct role the emperor had in Japanese atrocities. Interestingly, Hirohito makes this list while Tojo and Unit 731 don't, so I'm not really sure what the criteria are for being on the list. Also, apparently the Japanese forced Chinese men to rape their own wives and daughters? I've never heard of this. Japanese soldiers raping, yes, but the Chinese being forced to rape their own womenfolk? Anyone got a source on this?\n\n\\#13 Nero\n\nThis one, of course, perpetuates the myth of Nero fiddling while Rome burns, but at least leaves out the fiddle. We don't know who started the fire, but in a city made of wood with no fire code and lots of people using fire on a regular basis it's not really surprising that there was a fire. Not to mention, Nero personally searched the ruins for survivors and used the opportunity to rebuild sections of the city in brick and more spaced out to prevent future fires. It's also worth noting that most of the mentions of Nero's involvement in starting the fire are from writers who really had a bone to pick with him.\n\n\\#12 Caligula\n\nFirst off, what a ridiculous picture to use. Why not actually use one of the busts we have of the man, rather than some weird photoshopped thing? He did have himself worshipped as a god, but that's not really that big of a deal. I'm not sure that makes him evil, though. Various eastern rulers were worshipped as gods.\n1111\n\\#11 Attila the Hun\n\nWell, Attila was so feared that for centuries he was used as a bogeyman, sort of in the same way the Romans might talk about \"Hannibal at the gates\". Of course, I could very easily argue that Attila was really just a man who took advantage of his situation to increase his own power. The story that have about him murdering 11,000 women because Saint Ursula wouldn't marry him. Of course, as with all good legends, the story really doesn't appear until centuries after Attila's death. And seriously? A girl traveling with 11,000 companions? That seems ridiculous on the face of it. That's the number of men a king might bring with him as he marches to war, not to deliver a girl somewhere.\n\n\\#10 Genghis Khan\n\nYeah, he seemed like a pretty ruthless fellow. We do have evidence that he did cause the killing of over 10% of the world's population at the time, which is a lot. Apparently, it even reduced carbon emissions for centuries, so not all bad, right? I dunno, but murdering up to 75% of the population in the Iranian Plateau seems like pretty bad. I'm also not really sure how they decide the order of the ranking here, because they're not using numbers of people killed or anything.\n\n\\#9 Leopold II\n\nYeah, murdering 50% of the Congo Free State population in an effort to get rich is a little evil. Seriously, cutting off people's hands because they don't work hard enough is pretty sadistic.\n\n\\# 8 Torquemada\n\nWhere did they even this picture? It looks like it's from an early 2000's video game, maybe Oregon Trail. Anywho, apparently Torquemada actually toned down the Inquisition a little bit. Plus, he killed less than 2,000 people. I'm pretty sure most people's understanding of the Spanish Inquisition come from [Monty Python] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqreRufrkxM) or [Mel Brooks] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZegQYgygdw). (Both awesome by the way) But the thing is, the Inquisition, while pretty awful, probably doesn't really compare to actual genocidal actions, like say, the Holocaust, or Rwanda.\n\n\\#7 Mao\n\nMao did kill an awful lot of people, but it seems that most people are more likely to blame his wife for most of the atrocities. His ideas were really damn stupid (like having the peasants try to forge their own steel, or killing all the birds in the country), but I don't think he intended to starve millions of his own people to death. Yes, I know that's not an excuse and it doesn't resolve him of responsibility, but to be evil don't you have to be trying to kill them?\n\n\\#6 Ivan the Terrible\n\nIt seems that even today we can't really agree on Ivan. He was certainly mentally unstable, but he did unite Russia and was a very successful politician. He did murder his own son though, so not great. Still, I'm not really sure he should be higher than people like Mengele.\n\n\\#4 Pol Pot\n\nYeah, this guy was crazy. Who really wants to bring a country back to the stone age. His rule got so bad that Vietnam invaded because he was so sick. So yeah, I suppose he belongs here.\n\n\\#3 Hitler\n\nWait, what? Hitler is #3? How? Somehow starting the largest and bloodiest war mankind has ever known and directing the industrial murder of millions doesn't make you number 1? Who else could there possibly be who was worse?\n\nOh wait, of course it's #2, Stalin\n\nYeah, Stalin not so great of a person, so much so that after his death the USSR underwent De-Stalinization. And gulags, not cool. But we should note, that he was a very adept political leader and was able to use his victory in WW2 to expand the USSR to formerly Russian Empire lands. But wait, didn't he defeat Hitler? Does that not count for anything? But I suppose this fits in on the Internet, where Hitler was alright, I guess, and genocide olympics rule.\n\nBut wait, we've already covered Stalin, Mao, and Hitler and none of them are the most evil person who has ever lived in history? Who are we talking about here? FDR? Cthulu?\n\n\\#1 Vlad Dracula\n\n...huh? *He's* the most evil person to have ever lived? I mean, he also wasn't a nice person. You don't really get to be a warlord or run a country by being super nice. But he did halt the Ottoman advance into Wallachia and is seen as a hero in Romania. By his own documents he did inventively and cruelly murder people, but well, so did a lot of people. I'm not really gonna say that Vlad was significantly worse than, say *Hitler*.\n\n---------------\n\nSo yeah, people who don't know things or bother to research them are bad at making lists based on subjective traits. Also intriguing to me is how this doesn't contain so many other people, some of whom I mentioned before. Like Hideki Tojo, or Tamerlane, or Hong Xiuquan. I mean, I'm pretty sure they could beat out some of the other people on this list.",

        "text": "[Here] (http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2jvung/history_fans_of_reddit_what_is_a_common/clfiksi) is where we learn about how the Soviet Union's 1945 invasion of Manchuria was what caused Japan to surrender, not the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nGod, I hate this particular misconception. It's a perfect example of [this](http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&amp;id=2475#comic) effect\n\nThe theory here, for those who are not familiar with it, is that midnight Soviet invasion of Manchuria was what prompted the Japanese to surrender. I think this to be one of those strange contrary views of history. It's clearly wrong but people like to believe it when they first encounter it because they think it makes them smarter than everyone else. You're claiming that the Japanese were threatened by an imminent American invasion of their homeland, but a Soviet attack in China is what made them surrender? Does that sound likely? I didn't think so. Here's how things went down.\n\nAfter Hiroshima (August 6th, 1945), the Japanese weren't quite sure what to do. There was confusion as to what had happened, and it until about halfway through the day when they listened to Truman's broadcast about the use of the atomic bomb. The Japanese had had some difficulties with their own nuclear program, knew how hard the weapons were to build, and many decided the Americans probably didn't have another bomb. Things were happening very quickly, and no one was quite sure what to make of Hiroshima.\n\nAt midnight on August 8th, the Soviets invaded Manchuria. The Supreme Council for the Direction of the War learned about this at 4am, and convened to discuss it at 10:00 The prime minister and foreign minister were in favor of acquiescing to the Allies, the other four directors were not. At 11am, in the middle of the meeting, news arrived that the second atomic bomb had been dropped on Nagasaki. It was at this point that everyone decided to surrender, but wasn't sure how. The Prime Minister, Naval Minister, and Foreign Minister were in favor of just going with Potsdam so long as they got a guarantee the US wouldn't dethrone the Emperor, while the other 3 generals wanted to accept Potsdam with the conditions that Japan got to see to its own \ndisarmament, try its own war criminals, and not be occupied.\n\nThey then called the full cabinet to meet at 2:30pm. One of the points that came up during this was that an American POW under torture confessed that the United States \"Had 100 atomic bombs and would be bombing Kyoto and Tokyo in the next few days\". Despite this, the cabinet split much the way the council did. They had a brief recess at 5:30 and reconvened at 6, then adjourned at 10 having again reached no consensus. At this point, they decided to appeal to the Emperor.\n\nBoth sides of the debate explained their views to him, and at around 2am August 10th 1945, he decided to surrender and acquiesce to Potsdam. That morning, the Japanese sent a fax to the Allies announcing their attempt to surrender. After 5 days of preparation, minor negotiation, some waffling in the Japanese cabinet, and the aversion of an attempted coup, the Emperor delivered this speech to the Japanese people:\n\n\"Despite the best that has been done by everyone—the gallant fighting of the military and naval forces, the diligence and assiduity of Our servants of the State, and the devoted service of Our one hundred million people—the war situation has developed not necessarily to Japan's advantage, while the general trends of the world have all turned against her interest.\n\nMoreover, the enemy has begun to employ a new and most cruel bomb, the power of which to do damage is, indeed, incalculable, taking the toll of many innocent lives. Should we continue to fight, not only would it result in an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization.\n\nSuch being the case, how are We to save the millions of Our subjects, or to atone Ourselves before the hallowed spirits of Our Imperial Ancestors? This is the reason why We have ordered the acceptance of the provisions of the Joint Declaration of the Powers....\n\nThe hardships and sufferings to which Our nation is to be subjected hereafter will be certainly great. We are keenly aware of the inmost feelings of all of you, Our subjects. However, it is according to the dictates of time and fate that We have resolved to pave the way for a grand peace for all the generations to come by enduring the unendurable and suffering what is unsufferable.\"\n\nThis is pretty clearly not a reference to Russia.",

        "text": "[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2junqy/what_is_the_craziest_coincidence_in_human_history/clfbfp2) comment in AskReddit isn't horrible, but it's a diluted form of a rather popular conspiracy theory/myth. This is the idea that those US Presidents who were assassinated were assassinated because of their opposition to a central bank. Some of these myths try and tie the Rothschilds into all of them as well (presumably because of their financial connections to said central banks).\n\n[This](http://thetruthnews.info/bankers_and_presidents.html) site has a long list of Presidents who opposed banking and financial institutions and then had attempts on their lives. \n\nIn researching this myth I came across a few sites which were adding bad history on top of this (beyond just the central banking thing).\n\n[This](http://www.michaeljournal.org/lincolnkennedy.htm) site has some really bad history in it regarding Lincoln's assassination, so I thought I'd talk about it. Other people can tackle the other Presidents. \n\n&gt;During the Civil War (1861-1865), President Lincoln needed money to finance the War from the North. The Bankers were going to charge him 24% to 36% interest. \n\nTrue enough, money was needed. However stating \"The Bankers\" isn't helpful. Which bankers were those? When did they offer these loans? At least two prominent Northern bankers weren't offering loans at these exorbitant rates--Salmon P. Chase who was tapped to be Lincoln's Secretary of Treasury and Jay Cooke, a banker who became instrumental in selling war bonds (and incidentally in forming national banks later on). \n\n&gt;Eventually President Lincoln was advised to get Congress to pass a law authorizing the printing of full legal tender Treasury notes to pay for the War effort\n\nIf by eventually this guy means \"pretty damn quickly\", then this isn't too bad. The First Legal Tender Act was passed on February 25, 1862, less than a year after the war began. Also the greenbacks weren't the first paper money that was printed for the Civil War. Those would actually be the [Demand Notes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_Note). On July 17, 1861 an act was passed authorizing the US government to borrow 250,000,000 on its own credit. Up to $50,000,000 of this could be issued in non-interest Treasury Notes, which could be redeemed. In August the act was modified to allow the Demand Notes to be used payment of public dues. \n\nIn March Congress clarified that these Demand Notes were also to be accepted as legal tender--just as the notes authorized by the February 25th act were. \n\n&gt;Lincoln printed 400 million dollars worth of Greenbacks (the exact amount being $449,338,902), money that he delegated to be created, a debt-free and interest-free money to finance the War. It served as legal tender for all debts, public and private. He printed it, paid it to the soldiers, to the U.S. Civil Service employees, and bought supplies for war.\n\nWell actually, it was neither debt free *nor* interest free. \n\n[Section 2 of the Legal Tender Act says](http://legisworks.org/sal/12/stats/STATUTE-12-Pg345.pdf):\n\n\"That to enable the Secretary of Treasury to fund the Treasury notes and the floating debt of the United States, he is hereby authorized to issue, on the credit of the United States, coupon bonds, or registered bonds, to an amount not exceeding five hundred millions of dollars, redeemable at the pleasure of the United States after five years, and payable twenty years from date, and bearing interest at the rate of six percent annum, payable semi-annually. \n\nGreenbacks were definitely *not* intended to be debt free nor interest free.\n\n&gt;Shortly after that happened, “The London Times” printed the following: **“If that mischievous financial policy, which had its origin in the North American Republic, should become indurated down to a fixture, then that Government will furnish its own money without cost. It will pay off debts and be without a debt. It will have all the money necessary to carry on its commerce. It will become prosperous beyond precedent in the history of the civilized governments of the world. The brains and the wealth of all coun­tries will go to North America. That govern­ment must be destroyed, or it will destroy every monarchy on the globe.”**\n\n&gt;**The Bankers obviously understood. The only thing, I repeat, the only thing that is a threat to their power is sovereign govern­ments printing interest-free and debt-free paper money. They know it would break the power of the international Bankers.** [bolding is in the original page]\n \nOne slight problem--no such article ever appeared in the London Times. The earliest [confirmed printing](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Talk:Money) of this quote is 1898!\n\n&gt;After this was published in \"The London Times\", the British Government, which was controlled by the London and other European Bankers, moved to support the Confederate South, hoping to defeat Lincoln and the Union, and destroy this government which they said had to be destroyed.\n\nSince the article was never printed, no such movement could have happened as a result of said editorial. And in fact no such movement occurred at all. There *were* British observers who were in the South, but there were no plans by the British government to aid the South.\n\nAlso if it was an issue of paper money, why in the world would they support the South who started publishing paper money in April 1861!?!\n\n&gt;They were stopped by two things. First, Lincoln knew the British people, and he knew that Britain would not support slavery, so he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared that slavery in the United States was abolished. At this point, the London Bankers could not openly support the Confederacy because the British people simply would not stand for their country supporting slavery.\n\nIf the British government had wanted to go to war, it would have gone to war over the [Trent Affair](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Affair). Also paper money was first printed in the Union in the summer/fall of 1861. The Emancipation Proclamation wasn't signed until January 1, 1863. The Legal Tender Act was signed into law February 25, 1862. Why would the English bankers sit on their hands for almost a full year if the issue was so dear to them, and then wimp out with the Emancipation Proclamation?\n\n&gt;Second, the Czar of Russia sent a portion of the Russian navy to the United States with orders that its admiral would operate under the command of Abraham Lincoln. These ships of the Russian navy then became a threat to the ships of the British navy which had intended to break the blockade and help the South.\n\n[Ooh boy](http://i.imgur.com/0mw1I8e.gif). Part of the Russian Navy wintered in San Francisco and part in New York. In the winter of 1863. So part of this fleet (which was going to stop an imaginary blockade busting of Southern ports) was a continent away! The other part was in New York, where it stayed. Pretty impressive ships--they can harbor in New York and San Francisco and *still* be so terrifying to the stronger Royal Navy that Britain noped the fuck out of there.\n\n&gt;The North won the War, and the Union was preserved. America remained as one nation.\n\nOoh yippee! Some good history. \n\n&gt;Of course, the Bankers were not going to give in that easy, for they were determined to put an end to Lincoln's interest-free, debt-free Greenbacks. He was assassinated by an agent of the Bankers shortly after the War ended.\n\n*sigh* And so quickly crushed. Greenbacks weren't interest free, nor debt free. The US government had hundreds of millions of dollars in loans over the Civil War. They issued much of that in the form of bonds, most of which were bought by people with money to spare--i.e. bankers and wealthy business men. And there's no connection between John Wilkes Booth and these nefarious \"bankers\".\n\n&gt;Thereafter, Congress revoked the Green­back Law and enacted, in its place, the National Banking Act. \n\nThereafter *what*? After Lincoln's assassination? Nope, wrong! The [National Banking Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Bank_Act) was passed on February 25, 1863, a year to the date after the Legal Tender Act. Mostly the first National Bank Act dealt with currency, establishing a national currency and setting guidelines as to what banks could print and issue currency. It also established national banks. \n\n&gt;The national banks were to be privately owned and the national bank notes they issued were to be interest bearing. The Act also provided that the Greenbacks should be retired from circulation as soon as they came back to the Treasury in payment of taxes.\n\nThe Greenbacks didn't start to be retired from circulation until 1866. In 1868 there were still over $350,000,000 greenbacks in circulation. However, in the early 1870s Congress started to print more greenbacks again.

        "text": "You know what I almost never see? Bad history - or really any interest in the history - in my area of expertise. No one really seems to care, or - my personal theory - the mantra we're surrounded by suppresses interest in it (ooo, sounds all conspiratorial, doesn't it?). Imagine how absolutely thrilled I was when I encountered [this comment](http://np.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/2ij0s1/un_calls_for_korean_antidiscrimination_act/cl2ojtn), and its later replies [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/2ij0s1/un_calls_for_korean_antidiscrimination_act/cl2ojtn) and [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/2ij0s1/un_calls_for_korean_antidiscrimination_act/cl2pvil). Well, maybe not thrilled. Excited, at least. Yes, definitely excited that I now get to go rummaging through my collection of literature and my bank of expertise. If there's one thing I know, it's the history of the development of human rights, and I know that this lovely fellow is wrong. \n\nSo let's get something straight right off the bat. While the initial idea of the United Nations specifically did stem from the US Department of State in 1939, it was by no means the first conception of an international organisation. If nothing else, the League of Nations had been founded less than twenty years earlier and was rather similar in concept to the UN. More than that, the documents and principles on which the UN would be based were largely not written by Americans. [The Concert of Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_of_Europe), for example, was an alliance system between European powers which would, during particularly volatile times, call for conferences, and did so rather frequently during the early 19th century. Granted, it failed utterly because of hugely shifting political landscapes, but the ideas that governed it would have an influence on the organisations that would follow it. \n\nThe same holds true of the [Geneva Conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Conventions) and the [Hague Conferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hague_Conventions_of_1899_and_1907), both of which were foundational in establishing principles of international law and in establishing that things like war and war crimes could be governed. The 1899 Hague Convention also established the [Permanent Court of Arbitration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_Court_of_Arbitration) which still peacefully solves international disputes, especially border disputes and territorial issues. Neither of these were created by the US, though it did eventually become a participant in both groups of treaties. The Geneva Conventions were - shockingly - largely the result of activism by Henry Dunant, a Swiss citizen, while the first Hague Convention was proposed by Tsar Nicholas II of Russia. \n\nSaying, then, that the UN is strictly an American institution is misleading. The fact that its creation was proposed by a coalition of Roosevelt and Churchill does not mean that the ideas within it are American ideas, or that the ideals it seeks to uphold are the same as American ideals. The UN was building off a long(ish) legacy of international organisations established in Europe with the purpose of keeping the peace. Even if you don't accept that an international legacy is enough to argue that the UN started as an international organisation, the [Atlantic Charter](http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_16912.htm) - an very important document in the founding of the UN - though proposed by the US and UK, was quickly agreed to by the other Allied powers in the [Inter-Allied Council Statement on the Principles of the Atlantic Charter](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/interall.asp). In this document, there were also reservations and requests for amendments to the Charter, showing that this wasn't a unilateral imposition of the US and UK's will, but rather, a combined effort spearheaded by the powers in the best position to actually lead such an endeavour.\n\nThis takes us to the actual founding of the UN. The UN Charter had [26 original signatories](http://www.un.org/en/aboutun/charter/history/declaration.shtml), and grew to include a full 51 member states by the end of 1945 (the original charter and 51 member states are [here](https://treaties.un.org/doc/publication/ctc/uncharter.pdf), and I think it's pretty cool). Most importantly for our purposes, though, is the fact that, of the 51 member states, 49 of them were not the US or UK, and of the 26 original signatories, 24 weren't the US or UK. Granted, these original members and signatories were the Allied states, but the Allied states do not equate to the US and UK. The USSR, I suspect, would especially disagree. It's also well worth noting that for the charter to be accepted, it had to be ratified not only by the US and the UK, but also by France, the USSR, and China. In this regard, it was an international effort. Once again, this was not something necessarily imposed by a US-UK coalition, but rather something agreed to by several parties.\n\nHowever, there's an objection that can be raised, and it's the objection the linked poster raises here: \n\n&gt; There would never be a \"united nations\" or \"world bank\" these organizations were set up for foreign societies to fit to their standards.\n\nThere's also:\n\n&gt; If you really think the United nations were created by a group of random countries. There's books and classes available.\n\nThis is the trickier assertion to discuss. After all, while there were a variety of countries participating in the ratification of the UN Charter, and while the ideas in it came from a variety of sources, these ideas and sources were still largely European and came from a Western perspective (China and the USSR being two major exceptions). The document could still be said to be imposing American and British values even if it isn't strictly a document written just by those two. However, as interesting as the implications here are, it's still wrong to say that the most important documents for the UN were strictly written with American and British interests in mind. \n\nLet's leave the UN Charter for a moment - not because it's not important, but because I think there's another example that illustrates my point better - and look at another major document, the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml) (UDHR). The UDHR was commissioned to better expand on the rights ostensibly guaranteed by the UN Charter. This was written over a period of two years, having been commissioned in 1946 and ratified in 1948. The important thing about actually writing the document, though, is that it was written not just by European nations with European values, but by a coalition of states from many different regions. Susan Waltz writes in her article \"Reclaiming and Rebuilding the History of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\" that each nation had its own particular concerns that it wanted addressed in addition to the broader ideas of human rights. China, for instance, was interested in included protection from racism and discrimination as a human right, and Latin American states were interested in political protections that colonial states (like the UK) didn't want. Interestingly, the US shied away from use of the term \"human rights\" at all, preferring to use \"civil rights\" when referring to its own citizens and \"human rights\" when referring to others. Smaller states also ensured gender neutrality in the text. For instance, while the document originally read \"all men,\" input from these non-European states led it to be changed to \"all human beings.\" \n\nOn a greater level, though, input from a variety of sources led to a variety of perspectives being included. The most obvious of these is the two conventions and the political splits within them. These are the [Covenant on Civil and Political Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights) and the [Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Economic,_Social_and_Cultural_Rights). Elements of each are included in the UDHR, though the two conventions represent the biggest split in ideas of what human rights actually are. The USSR, for instance, didn't like the CCPR, and the US wasn't a big fan of the CESCR. You'll never guess why. \n\nMy point here, though, is that the UDHR was a collaborative effort with many different perspectives involved in its creation. It wasn't just that the US and UK said \"Right, this is how it's going to be.\"\n\nWell, mostly not. To really get into that, I'd be bordering on rule 2, but it must also be noted that even during the adoption of the UDHR, objections were raised to it that basically amounted to \"You're imposing ideas on us that aren't part of our culture.\" While this idea is seen over and over in human rights documents (with the Convention on Equality and Discrimination Against Women probably being the best known example), there is some legitimacy to it. The UDHR is very much based on a principle of individualism, and sometimes clashes with many other sets of values, especially in the Middle East and Asia. \n\nDoes this mean it is definitely an American document? Most certainly not, and it can't be said enough that there is a big difference between the US and the UN. While the US did play a large part in helping form the UN, and while the impact of that still holds true throughout the current model of human rights, the UDHR and the UN Charter were a collaborative effort between many nations, each contributing its ideas and helping build what it saw as a better world.",

        "text": "Bitcoin \"true believers\" are an interesting group. They eagerly await the collapse of the US dollar and the other *dirty fiat currencies* and a time when Bitcoin will be the true world currency (and they'll all get rich - simply a coincidence, of course), while ignoring the complete social collapse and anarchy (the bad kind) that would come from the unlikely event of this happening. But I'm not here to argue against Bitcoiners. I'm here to talk about [this](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/why-bitcoin-value-doesnt-matter/) article. Specifically, this part:\n\n&gt; The U.S. Dollar is poised for a collapse of epic proportions, according to many experts. The \"Great Recession\" of 2008-2009 was just foreplay. A currency's \"Global Reserve Currency\" status lasts anywhere from 65-70 years, on average, and the U.S. Dollar has been \"in office\" for over 70 years now. The sphere of influence of the U.S. Military worldwide, with well over 100 nations occupied by military bases, is the main thing keeping the dollar in business right now. But times are changing.\n\nSpecifically specifically, this part:\n\n&gt;A currency's \"Global Reserve Currency\" status lasts anywhere from 65-70 years, on average, and the U.S. Dollar has been \"in office\" for over 70 years now.\n\nMost of the article is /r/BadEconomics, but this part is so obviously bad history that I just have to take it on.\n\n### The dollar as a reserve currency.\n\nFor those who aren't in the know, a reserve currency is basically a currency that a country or large institutions within a country use for trade. For example, even though China and the United States have different currencies, the Chinese hold US dollars to trade with the United States, as the US dollar is the dominant world reserve currency.\n\nThe article claims that this has been true for seventy years. [This is based on the idea](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/liamhalligan/10978178/The-dollars-70-year-dominance-is-coming-to-an-end.html) that the establishment of the Bretton Woods system in 1944 established the dollar as the world reserve currency. This is true, in a sense - the Bretton Woods system had all other currencies pegged to the US dollar. However, [the US dollar was also pegged to gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system#Fixed_exchange_rates) at $35/ounce. This effectively meant that every currency was pegged to gold. This held true until Nixon [ended the gold standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_Shock) in 1971, basically ending the Bretton Woods system. So while it's technically true that the US dollar has been the dominant world reserve currency for seventy years, it's misleading - it's more accurate to say it's been that way for forty.\n\n### Seventy year limit to reserve status.\n\nThe first thing that we'd probably consider as a world reserve currency is the Greek drachma, which [was widely used throughout Hellenistic kingdoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_drachma#Ancient_drachma) from the time of Alexander the Great to their conquest by the Roman empire - [about three hundred years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_period). This is far longer than the seventy years claimed by the article.\n\nAfter that, you get in to the [Roman denarius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_currency#Empire), which lasted another four hundred and fifty years, approximately. Of course, this ignores the reserve currencies of the East, which included the [tael](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tael) currency (closer to a measurement than what we'd consider a currency - I'll get to that), and [punch-marked coins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch-marked_coins) of India, lasting much longer than seventy years. \n\nThe middle ages saw the Venetian [ducat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ducat), or the Byzantine [solidus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidus_%28coin%29). The Spanish _real de a ocho_ - piece of eight - was used from the time of the Spanish empire [all the way through to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_dollar#History) the start of the United States, and even beyond. It's what the United States dollar was based on, as well as many currencies in other countries (especially the _peso_). The British Empire had (and still has) the pound sterling. All of these currencies lasted for _at least_ one hundred years. I don't know where they got this sixty five - seventy year number from, but it's not accurate (if anyone knows, please tell me). \n\n### Does it even matter?\n\nThe implication from this quote is that this supposed fact, that world currencies before the US dollar lasted for sixty five to seventy years, applies directly to the world today. As you may notice, we do not live in the same world we used to. Globalization has changed the world economy in huge ways, and you no longer need to be an empire to have the world currency (unless you're one of those people who think that America and the EU are empires, ~~because that's not really true~~ depends on what you consider as an empire - see [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2jq8gq/in_which_no_currency_has_ever_been_used_for_trade/cle53vc) comment).\n\nWhat's more important is that most of these previous world currencies were tied to gold or silver (or _made_ of gold or silver). You can't draw parallels between a currency that is essentially a measurement of a precious metal and a currency whose value depends on what the holder values it at. If these currencies lasted for only seventy years (which, as we've established, they didn't), you can't take that number and apply it to the US dollar.\n\n### That's it.\n\nThis is my first attempt at a bad history submission, so feel free to tell me what I got wrong, whether I should never post again, commit suicide, etc. I tried to leave my predictions about the future of the dollar as the world reserve currency because I'm not an expert in any sense of the word. Please don't get mad at me for criticizing Bitcoin, if you can hear me from the moon.",

        "text": "I mean, I don't recall Poland ever invading the Aztecs with giant death robots, and I'm pretty sure Assyrians never went to the Moon. This game is ridiculous! It's like it's not even trying!\n\nIn all seriousness, though, while most of the game can't begin to make a claim to historical accuracy, certain aspects can. For instance, in those little video clips that introduce each leader ([this one's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNOKwu6nM0) one of my favourites because he just seems so gosh darn happy to see you), the leaders are generally - *generally* - speaking the language that they would be speaking. Sure, some languages have pretty clearly changed since these leaders ruled, but at least the game is trying. There is one example that really juts out at me, though. Scattered in between Zulu and Mandarin and Maya, there's [Ramesses II](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbtOwbjC8Kw). What's wrong with Ramesses? I don't know enough about ancient Egyptian clothing to comment on that, or on his little setpiece there, but I do speak Arabic, and I do know that he is speaking modern Arabic. \n\nWhy is this bad history? Well, to understand why it's bad, we have to understand a bit about the history of the Arabic language. To understand that, we have to understand what Arabic actually is. Arabic is not so much one universal language as it is a group of similar(ish) dialects that are grouped together for political and social purposes. These dialects aren't always intelligible to speakers of another dialect (as an example compare [this list of Standard vocabulary](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-rJz9bR9I8) to [this list of Moroccan vocabulary](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM5MQORS9n8)), and tend to be radically different, especially for words that describe local, mundane things (the word for \"chicken\" varies wildly, for instance, while words about governance and prayer will tend to remain similar). Indeed, in many places, spoken Arabic is basically a liturgical language that is learned for the purposes of prayer and worship, not unlike Latin or Hebrew (outside Israel). However, one version of Arabic is considered \"standard,\" and is generally what is taught in schools. This version is used in formal affairs (politicians will give speeches in this dialect to sound more sophisticated, for instance), and is used primarily in a written form. This version is based on the Quran, meaning it's the same across the Arabic-speaking world. It's not really spoken, but hey, if you're ever in a pinch, throw some out there and impress a cab driver!\n\nThere are several theories about why Arabic is the way it is, but all of them focus on the Islamic conquests of the 7th century and beyond. The traditional idea was that Arabic swept through the Middle East and North Africa and became the lingua franca, replacing traditional languages because of convenience and necessity. The dialects, then, can be seen either as the result of natural linguistic drift (as Joshua Blau suggests in \"Studies in Middle Arabic and its Judaeo-Arabic Variety\"), or of a process of pidginisation and creation of creoles (as proposed by Kees Verstegh in his book \"The Arabic Language\"). Another theory is the [Koine Hypothesis](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/410601?uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21104956085923), which suggests that, rather than Arabic being super-imposed over native languages, two forms of Arabic came into being, one written and one spoken, with dialects then diverging through a blending with local languages to form the dialects we all know and love today. \n\nWhat's important to note about all of this, though, is the dates. While we don't know when exactly Arabic was first being spoken - the first surviving written Arabic dates back to the 6th century CE, but that says nothing about when it was first spoken - we do know that Arabic left the Arabian Peninsula as part of the Islamic conquests. The earliest it could have been introduced to Egypt as a language spoken by heads of state would be the 7th century CE. \n\nThe trouble here is that Ramesses II died in 1213 BCE, long before Arabic had been introduced to Egypt. His language of choice would most likely have been Egyptian (specifically the Middle Egyptian Language). While his particular form of Egyptian began to die out as a language around the time of his reign, it survived as a written language well into Roman times. The descendent language of this is Coptic (though it's a descendent in a more distant relationship than the one between modern and old English - unintelligible, but you can see the hints of a relationship if you look through the cracks), which sounds like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu5wlpej1OM). For comparison, [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyL2m5Qb5Co) is the same text in Standard Arabic. They are not the same language, and while they're in the same language family, that still doesn't make them the same language. That would be like saying that Italian and German are the same language because they're both Indo-European - no, not really. Coptic was spoken as a rural language into the 17th century, with Renaissance scholars being sent out to Egyptian villages to learn it. It's still used as a liturgical language in Coptic churches today. It's not as if it's completely dead or unreproduceable.\n\nWhile Civ V does make efforts to educate its players - I'm one of those people who's actually read the Civilopedia entries about city states and rulers - I'm disappointed in this aspect of the game. While I know there's not a flood of native ancient Egyptian speakers out there, considering how much fun the little scenes are, I'd expect a bit more effort when it comes to knowing Egyptian history.\n\nAlso, Ramesses took my city and I'm mad at him. That has nothing to do with this post.",

        "text": "(Mods, forgive me if this doesn't fall under the remit of Badhistory - whilst it's not necessarily about a historic event, it is about the preservation of historic vessels, which I hope is under our umbrella)\n\nNaval history is somewhat of a penchant of mine, especially that of the First World War, so it was rather a disappointment to me when I opened the BBC news homepage this morning to see ['On board WW1's last surviving warship'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-29672262) - a title itself which is entirely incorrect.\n\nFirstly, before I begin I'd like to state that I completely and utterly agree with the Lottery Fund's donation of £11 million to preserve *Caroline* - she is a vessel with a notable history, taking part at Dogger Bank in covering the crippled *Lion*, Beatty's flagship for the operation. Moreover, she was also present at Jutland, and at the time of her decommissioning in 2011 was the second oldest ship in RN service after Nelson's *Victory*. The problem with the video and article is that they state that *Caroline* is the last remaining warship of the First World War still afloat:\n0:24\n&gt;  This is particularly important because it's the last remaining ship from the First World War that is still floating\n\nWell... No. They could be forgiven for thinking it's the last remaining RN ship still afloat, if it weren't for the [*HMS President (1918)*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_President_%281918%29), a Flower-Class anti-sub sloop. It's not the biggest warship to have been preserved, that being *USS Texas*, which is 27000 tonnes to the 4219 tonnes of *Caroline*. The one caveat that I can think of is that it's probably the last remaining light cruiser of the war - *Aurora* being a protected cruiser and *Georgios Averof* being an armoured cruiser.\n\nMoreover, the video goes on to state other historic inaccuracies, at about 1:15 it is stated that:\n\n&gt; ...those turbines were cutting edge technology, and allowed the ship to do 29.5 knots, which is unrivaled even today for modern warships\n\nWell, no again. Whilst 29.5 knots certainly isn't slow in naval terms, it is beaten by modern warships. The *Ticonderoga* class cruisers, in commission as a class from 1983 can make 32.5 knots, and the latest British destroyers - the Type 45s - can make over 30 knots. So, whilst *Caroline* is fast, she's not 'unrivaled' by any means.\n\nI've every sympathy with the preservation of such an old vessel, especially considering we are within the centenary years of the First World War but, either as an attempt to sensationalize or as a result of poor research, this video-article leaves me somewhat disappointed.",

        "text": "http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21623758-chinas-back\n\nIf you study economic history you are well familiar with this Chart or various versions of it, with one data point being Year 1, the next Year 1000, the next Year 1500, then in hundred or fifty or some such year intervals after that. Just looking at the intervals, you can see that what is actually being said is \"I have no idea of anything before 1500, but 'throughout history' sounds cooler than 'in the last 500 years'\". And, sure enough, that is what is going on here. I'll detail what is wrong with each part:\n\nRome: You will notice that the Roman Empire's share is small, very small. In fact, it is rather comically small, because by every reasonable estimate the Roman economy was the largest in the world by quite a bit. To give an example, Walter Scheidel argues that the wealthiest Romans were about twice as wealthy as the wealthiest Chinese. Now, this does not mean that the Roman economy was twice as large as the Han economy--for the first, public and private wealth was more fluid in the Roman empire than Han China, and for the second, this more traces the extent of monetization, which is not one to one with size of economy--but it gives a good indication.\n\nIndia: The main problem here, of course, is that India wasn't a thing. The post-Maurya period is notoriously complex so I will cheat a little and skip ahead about a century and a half, but basically India can be though of as divided into three parts: the *arya-varta* (basically the Indus and Ganges, or \"northern India\") was controlled by the Kushan Empire, the Deccan was controlled by the Satavahana, and the south was subject to contention by various Tamil kingdoms. The political situation in Bengal and the lower Ganges is unclear, which goes for other areas in the subcontinent. So broadly speaking, India was not a single economy, but even if it were it would be hard to imagine it was as large as the Roman one, as north India was really only truly urbanized region.\n\nChina: No real issue with China, so I may as well use this space to draw attention to the Year 1500 chart (which suspiciously does not include the Ottomans--rather lazy, that). The chart comparing India, China and Italy is virtually identical to the one for Year 1, which points to the conclusion that they basically copypasted it on to Year 1. Somewhat oddly, 1500 (or, really, jumping ahead about half a century) is actually a good year for having India as the top world economy under the early Mughals--Year 1 and 1000 really aren't.\n\nThis chart is basically a really bad example of blatant back projection. What is very frustrating is that the Year 1 and 1000 section add nothing--you would still have an interesting narrative starting in 1500, and one that is historically coherent and supportable.\n\nA good source for this is Ian Morris' *Why the West Rules--for Now*.",

Kind of an interesting little factoid, and the tumblr user even links to Wikipedia, which is more than most tumblr users do. \n\nCouple of things immediately set the alarm bells ringing though.\n\n1.) The Seven Years' War ended in 1763. Now maybe the poster meant that there was increased tension because of the Seven Years' War, but that didn't stop France from being so magnanimous with the open seas. Seems a stretch to me, but it's possible.\n\n2.) The story is too good to be true. An act of generosity \"for all mankind\" during a war? Not likely. Come to find out that it's not true at all. Not only is it not true, the \"source\" provided by the original poster doesn't even support what they were saying. The Wikipedia article points out that both the 1761 and 1769 transits were international affairs with hundreds of observers around the world. \n\nIt then goes on to point out that in 1761 (*not* 1769), the *British* (not the French), allowed a French ship safe passage. The Wikipedia article does claim that the French allowed the *Endeavour* free passage to Tahiti because the voyage was one of importance to all mankind. It quotes as it's source a JSTOR article, published in 1986, which unfortunately I don't have access to and I'm not willing to pay $40 to get access!\n\nHowever, I suspect that the Wikipedia article is taking that source out of context, because A.) The French would have no business in the area, other than general exploration. In fact France made no claims on the island of Tahiti until the mid-19th century! and B.) A far more likely explanation for the lack of action against the *Endeavour* was to avoid another war. ",

        "text": "Prior to 1921, the black community in Tulsa was the wealthiest in the nation.  Confined to the Greenwood district, the black community created a thriving area, with numerous homes, businesses, churches, and even a black hospital which was very important in segregated Oklahoma. But in 1921, following the alleged assault of a white women, the city erupted into a riot, with hundreds of either wounded or dead, and millions of dollars of property damage.  \n\nThis post will not fully educate you about what occurred during the Tulsa Race Riot.  The only purpose of this post is to point out some bad history found in one users comments.\n\n\n\n[Earlier Today](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2jgccq/til_that_in_1921_a_group_of_whites_burnt_the/) on TIL, a post was submitted about the Race Riots, and one commenter in particular was, well, pulling \"facts\" out of thin air.\n\nIn response to a user criticizing the City's denial of responsibility, [This](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2jgccq/til_that_in_1921_a_group_of_whites_burnt_the/clbox01) post was submitted. \n\n&gt; Of course the city does not accept the responsibility of the massacre. The city has an inability to massacre people.\n\nExcept the city did play a hand in the riot. Following the riot, a grand jury found Police Chief John Gustafson responsible for the rioting because he willingly neglected to fulfill his duties and keep the peace.  He was removed from his post, but never faced any prison time. Alongside this, no white rioters every faced any legal actions for their role in the riot, compared to blacks who's two choices were to flee the city or be held in detention centers. Detention centers in which several blacks were known to have died.\n\nFollowing the riot, the Tulsa City Chamber of Commerce created the Tulsa Real Estate Exchange to help rebuild the Greenwood district.  Appointed to lead this group was W.T. Brady, founder of Tulsa, politician, and KKK member who served with the Klan on the night of the riot.  The Real Estate Exchange set up new building codes that were far too expensive for the original owners, in the hopes  that the district would be rebuilt as a commercial and industrial area, and blacks would have to move further north. While this move was struck down as unconstitutional by the Oklahoma Supreme Court, it does highlight the fact that the city was taking an active role against the black community.\n\n&gt; Yes very little money was spent to clean the greenwood district which was the \"black wall street\", but it wasn't the district that took the major brunt of destruction. It was the homes.\n\nNope.  Nope.  Nope.  It was the district that took the major brunt of the destruction.  Homes are a part of the district.  But homes weren't the only loss.  191 businesses, a junior high school, a handful of churches, and the only hospital in the area that admitted blacks were all burned down.  The entire district suffered.  1,200 homes were lost, but the losses of these other important assets to the community would have also been devastating.   \n\n&gt; Homes that were built out of basically folded cardboard, and shanty house. Homes built before things like insurance was available, before FEMA, and government assistance.\n\nCardboard.  Cardboard? Really? Okay, except not.  These building would have been built out of brick and wood.  In a town that was called the \"Black Wall Street,\" they lived in a \"shanty town.\"  Well the pictures could have fooled me, because [This](http://imgur.com/a/rIoTC) is the most brickish looking cardboard town I have seen.\n\n&gt; We are talking nearly 100 years after the riot you expect people that have no living relative (or even someone they can name) no connection to the history of it at all to repay other people who have no connection to the event simply because they are black and happen to now live in North Tulsa.\n\nWeird, because [This](http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/7/19/survivors-of-infamous1921tulsaraceriotstillhopeforjustice.html) Al-Jazeera article from this July seems to show that there are still survivors of the event.  As for relatives, yeah there are quite a few. In 2001 the Oklahoma State Legislature established 300 scholarships for the descendants of survivors.  That aside, I seriously doubt that a story of this magnitude would not be passed down three or four generations. But sure, go ahead and assume that the people coming forward are just making these claims because they're black Tulsans.\n\n&gt; North Tulsa is a shit hole, that has seen great growth in the last 10 years of redevelopment and revitalization of the pearl district, bluedome, and River view.\n\nThis is just bad geography.  None of those areas are part of the Greenwood District.\n\n[Here] (http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2jgccq/til_that_in_1921_a_group_of_whites_burnt_the/clboftq) the same user posts even more untrue statements.\n\n&gt; I have studied both by being forced through the material in high school \n\n\"Forced?\" No bad history here, but using that word just seems weird to me.  Anyways, moving on. \n\n&gt; No bombs were ever dropped. It simply is not true. The planes were all accounted for during that period of time and none of them were anywhere near the area. We are also not talking a lot of planes as this was 1921.\n\nFalse! Tim Madigan's book *The Burning: Massacre, Destruction, and the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921* provides the testimonies of numerous witnesses who attest to aircraft bombing the district.  What occurred was that six trainer planes (used during World War One) took off.  Law Enforcement Officials stated that the purpose was for reconnaissance, but survivors maintain that not only were rifles fired from the planes, but incendiary bombs were dropped from these planes.  The users statement is based on a lot of incorrect assumptions, including that there wouldn't be planes around in 1921.\n\n&gt; The race riot is very well documented, and taught in Oklahoma. Long before the state recognized it the curriculum taught the material.\n\nIt is very well documented, the user doesn't seem to be consulting the documents in any of his posts, but yes the documents are there.  \n\nWhere he is wrong here is how much the subject was taught in Oklahoma.  I grew up in Tulsa and can personally attest that before it was mandated that it be taught in 2011, the topic was not touched by all schools.  While the user may have had a different experience, his statement that it was taught in Oklahoma is incorrect.  My Oklahoma history book had a at most half of a page dedicated to the subject.  We spent maybe thirty minutes discussing it in class, between learning about the First World War and the Great Depression.  Many people I have talked to about the Race Riot either don't know all of the facts, or don't even know that we had one.  You can't say that it was taught in Oklahoma, at least not to everyone. \n\n&gt; The numbers for how many were killed is actually below 100, if memory serves it was somewhere in the mid 50's mark. (Still horrible, but no need to make it bigger than actually was)\n\nIn a way, this is actually correct.  The official death count is 39.  But there is widespread belief that there are mass graves located outside of Tulsa.  Red Cross Workers reported that they believed the death count to be around 300 blacks.  Following the riots there was a rush to bury the bodies, loading up cars and driving them out of town.  Unfortunately we are unable to back up these claims since the state government has made very few attempts to find these graves.\n\n&gt; Many people claim the numbers are historically low because there was a mass grave and people buried that were not counted, as well as people removed by the train cars. The location of the \"mass grave\" was dug up a few years ago to install a baseball field and guess what no bodies.\n\nYes that is the claim, but again, the user mixes up facts.  I can find no statements that show that anyone believed that the bodies were buried anywhere near the baseball field, which is a few blocks away from the Greenwood District.  I can't find any articles about a dig turning up any results, or any claims that bodies were there in the first place. \n\n&gt; Also the train tracks were one of the first items destroyed so no trains were coming in or out of Tulsa to remove those bodies.\n\nThis statement is just false.  The train tracks were not actually destroyed.  On the last day of the riots, rumors began amongst the whites that black reinforcements were coming in from Muskogee via train.  One incoming train was even caught up in the crossfire and passengers had to drop to the floor for their safety. That same morning, Oklahoma National Guard troops arrived in Tulsa from Oklahoma City via train, and within a few hours restored order to the city.\n\n&gt; The Race Riot was a horrendous act committed in a time when lynchings and race riots were common. The slow movement of the state to recognize that an injustice was done is horrid.\n\nAt least the user agrees that it was horrendous. But the state wasn't just \"slow to recognize that an injustice was done.\" The state was deliberate in it's lack of prosecution of white rioters, lack of aid provided to the victims, omission from history books, and the city's attempt to use the violence as a way to push blacks even further out of the city. It wasn't until 1996 that the State commissioned for a report about what transpired to be created.  When the report came out in 2001, the state legislature refused to take most of the actions the commission suggested to compensate the victims and the area. \n\n&gt; It was not an all out war on a black neighborhood.\n\nI don't know what else to call it. It's what [the newspapers](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85042345/1921-06-01/ed-1/seq-1/#words=negroes+Negro+negro&amp;date1=1921&amp;rows=20&amp;searchType=basic&amp;state=Oklahoma&amp;date2=1921&amp;proxtext=negro&amp;y=9&amp;x=5&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;index=14) called it.   35 city blocks destroyed, including over 1,200 homes, 191 businesses, several churches, and the only hospital that admitted blacks.  Deliberately targeted with fire from the ground, from cars, and from planes.  10,000 blacks lost their homes.  800 were injured, but that only includes counts of those admitted into white hospitals, since any injured blacks were detained in internment centers. At least 39 dead, but casualties believed to be in the hundreds. What should we call it? A battle? Destruction?  A massacre?  I don't know.  But regardless of what it should be called, you can't deny what happened there. \n\nSources used include \nFinal Report of the Oklahoma Commission to Study the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921\nThe Burning: Massacre, Destruction, and the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921 by Tim Madigan\nRiot and Remembrance: The Tulsa Race War and its Legacy by James Hirsch\nAl-Jazeera\nWikipedia\nTulsa Race Riot by the Tulsa Historical Society\nTulsa Race Riot by the Oklahoma Historical Society\nThe Morning Tulsa Daily World \n\n\nI got a response to my attempts to correct a few of his claims.  [Here](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2jgccq/til_that_in_1921_a_group_of_whites_burnt_the/clbtde1?context=3)\n\n&gt; But what I stated was not incorrect the bulk of what was burned during the Tulsa Race Riot was homes, homes of notoriously poor and downtrodden people that were little more than shanties.\n\nNot true.  It was called \"Black Wall Street\" for a reason.  It was the most prosperous black community in the United States. In fact the district had numerous doctors, lawyers, and wealthy business owners.  Some allege that conflict between whites and blacks in Tulsa stemmed from the fact that there were quite a few blacks that were better off economically than whites.\n\n&gt; Yes the actual Black wall street was burned and the few business there, but the bulk of the destruction came from the homes.\n\nThe destruction affected everything.  It wasn't just homes and \"a few businesses.\"  The commercial section of Greenwood was destroyed. 191 businesses burnt down. Most buildings in the district were residential, but that doesn't necessarily mean that only residencies suffered. \n\n&gt; Homes that could not be rebuilt as they were had no insurance or means to purchase in a time where government help did not really exist.\n\nAgain, this isn't true.  While individuals did not receive government help, they were able to rebuild.  Within five years the district was rebuilt.  During the 1920's, the area was a hotbed for jazz and blues music.  Today the Oklahoma Jazz Hall of Fame stands a few blocks from Greenwood. The user seems to have an idea that the members of this community were all destitute, but it wasn't called \"Black Wall Street\" without reason. \n\nThe rest of his comment is just an argument against paying for the damages caused to the community.

[This is a picture of the post in question.](http://i.imgur.com/bC8EJ65.png) This is a classic case of a situation which arises what seems like weekly or even bi-weekly in /r/AskHistorians; that is, a \"cool\" or authoritative sounding answer which is well written gets to a highly upvoted question (was at #1 on AH on the evening of the 15th and I'm writing this on the evening of the 16th, it's still at the top) before anyone else gets there. People are *dying* for an answer so they latch onto whatever someone posts first even if it's totally unsourced conjecture and factually bullshit. \n\nThis post, from start to finish, **is wrong**. I was more polite in the thread as I wanted to maintain an air of professionalism but here's where it comes out -- this post is total and utter bullshit and it more than annoys me this got upvoted as much as it did. Disgusted is a strong word but that's one I'm feeling right now because 812 people *at least* felt it was a true statement and are now operating off of the falsehoods of this reply. This thread is to act as a warning and a public service announcement: \n\n##**Do not trust anything, even on /r/AskHistorians, just because it's well written or highly upvoted or gilded. Redditors are fickle creatures. If something is unsourced, ask for it and don't believe it if you haven't previously verified it. If someone is saying something that is clearly an opinion shoehorned in, ask them about it.** \n\nLet this rule 5 be an example:\n\n* **Paragraph 1:**\n\n✔ \n\nIt's pretty hard to get it wrong when speaking so vaguely. The first paragraph is pretty okay. Skirmishers were armed with ranged weapons who fought in open order and whose purpose was to disrupt the enemy but were vulnerable constantly and had to be used carefully. Yes.\n\n* **Paragraph 2:**\n\nAaaaaaaaaand he crashes.\n\n1. The theory that the stirrup was some catalyst which made cavalry formations 'useful' was produced in the 60's, completely exaggerated, and disproven in the 70's. Through testing of Roman saddles by Peter Connoly and Anne Hyland stirrups failed to show any significant advantages on the battlefield. What they did provide was easier mounting/dismounting, comfort, and quicker training. Just a simple understanding of military history prior to the Medieval Era shows effective use of dense shock formations of cavalry without any stirrup; see Alexander the Great for the most notorious examples. For a comprehensive deconstruction of the stirrup theory see  Bernard S. Bachrach's article *\"Charles Martel, Mounted Shock Combat, the Stirrup, and Feudalism.\"*\n\n2. *\"Even when the longbow . . . became the dominant weapon of medieval battlefields\"* NO. The Longbow was not ever the \"dominant weapon of medieval battlefields.\" It was used only extensively by the British...during the 100 years' war...and in very small numbers elsewhere when people hired English mercenaries. It was a neat weapon but it was by no means 'central' or even vitally important to anywhere outside of the French battlefields...between 1337 and 1453. If you want to say something was the \"dominant weapon of medieval battlefields\" that would be pretty conclusively the pike. Medieval warfare was defined by cavalry dominating all with infantry forming dense pike squares to counteract that best they could...which leads to my next point and the most egregiously wrong thing he says all post...\n\n* **Paragraph 3:**\n\n*\"with the introduction of firearms, skirmishers largely dropped out of military relevance.\"*\n\nNo. Nooooooooo. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.\n\nWant to know why this is totally wrong? Because it was the introduction of firearms which was what brought skirmishers back into significant military relevance. He literally could not be more wrong; he could have said \"purple elephant\" and it would have been more correct. This is literally the most incorrect assertion he could have possibly made about this topic.\n\nSkirmishing forces wouldn't be *irrelevant* throughout the Medieval Era in any way but it would be the rise of musketry which shot them into the spotlight. It was through the 17th and 18th centuries with advances in musketry which pushed skirmishing forces into being prestigious and tactically necessary bodies of Western armies. Guns were stupendously effective against cavalry when integrated in with pike formations and through this a natural evolution would occur where skirmishing screens would develop on the outskirts of pike formations and eventually become their own independent units. The most notable first case of this would be from *caracol's* which would have cavalrymen with light or no armor who would trot up in quick pace to the enemy infantry block, wheel left, fire off both of their pistols, cycle to the back, reload, and go up front again. \n\n* **Paragraph 4 &amp; 5**\n\nHe uses the American Revolution for some reason as the rise of skirmisher tactics despite it being a total afterthought in Western military thought. He heavily implicates that rifled muskets were a necessary precursor to skirmishing tactics being popularized or even useful which is flat out and horribly wrong. He also gets on the American exceptionalism bandwagon when he spouts the common exceptionalist propaganda that American's were the first to use \"guerrilla tactics\" against those stupid Brits who just stood in lines all day. The fact is is that the Brits were quite keen on using light infantry tactics in their colonial holdings for the very reason that he describes -- it's mostly not open terrain and requires a finer touch. They were not dumb, they knew this. Yet he assumes they did not even know of skirmishing tactics as apparently the Americans, in his words, forced the British to \"learn the lesson\".\n\nLastly this fetishization of the rifled musket being the necessary catalyst for everyone realizing how good screening forces were is just bullshit. They knew what rifled muskets could do they just chose not to use them. They were hard to maintain (needed constant reboring because the rifling would be damaged during every reload since it was muzzle loaded), it took longer to reload (60-120 seconds compared to 15-25 with a smoothbore), and was generally less durable; the latter being most necessary for these types of men. The French nothing less than *shunned* rifled muskets throughout the war and they had massive fame centered around their skirmishing bodies. The entire Western world equipped their skirmishing forces largely with smoothbore muskets through the end of the Napoleonic Wars for a reason. \n\n **Special Mention:**\n\nHim saying the 95th Rifles et al. were \"forerunners to modern day special forces\" is just laughable. That's what sealed the deal for me.\n\nI wish I saved his replies to us all before it was deleted (they were pretty derisive so they were purged for good reason) but yeah, it doesn't get much better from then on. He just crumbles under his own lack of knowledge. So let this be a lesson -- just because it's on AH and because it's upvoted a lot doesn't mean it's right; especially when it's unsourced.\n\n-----\n\n**Further Reading:**\n\n*The Rise of Modern Warfare* by H.W.

This comment says that the security measures now in place have always been in place, and it's just the branding that's different. This is inaccurate, to say the least. The history of airport security is decidedly more nuanced than that, and actually a really interesting story.\n\nTo understand why the comment is wrong, we'll go back several decades to the 1960s. As [this](http://www.wired.com/2013/06/fa_planehijackings/) illustration shows, security was pretty much non-existent (at least by our standards). People could waltz up to the gate and get on the plane without ever having seen the light of a metal detector. Indeed, when Congress suggested installing metal detectors as part of airline security in 1968, airlines resisted heavily, saying that it would freak people out. Additional security measures would dissuade people from flying. The matter was dropped. All the rifling through bags and scanning people didn't happen at this point.\n\nIn the late 60s to early 70s, though, there was a rash of hijackings (to the point where there were more than 130 hijackings between 1968 and 1972), enough that the idea of a hijacking became entirely routine. It wasn't until 1961 that hijacking a plane actually became a crime, and considering most of the hijacked planes didn't much want to stay in the US, that wasn't much of a disincentive. Many of the hijacked flights made a beeline for Cuba, seeing it as a haven of equality and democracy. For Castro, this was an annoyance, though also an excuse to denounce the West and ransom planes back to American airlines. Most of these hijackers ended up in what were basically prisons or on gulags. Even during this rash of hijackings, though, airlines resisted installing metal detectors, citing both the fact that people wouldn't like them and that they were a violation of privacy. Instead, sky marshals started flying on flights, but there weren't nearly enough of them to stop hijackers. Airlines also adopted a policy of non-violence, equipping cockpits with charts of the Caribbean and instructing crews to do what they were told by hijackers. It wasn't until a senator was nearly killed during a hijacking in 1968 that serious pressure was put on airlines to change these policies. In 1969, airlines started a program of evaluating a passenger's behaviour, and if that passenger was deemed suspicious, they would be sent through a metal detector. This was a rousing success with passengers, who were glad that something was being done about hijackings and didn't view it as an undue violation of their privacy. \n\nHowever, this system was rather prone to human error, and hijackings continued. To be fair, many hijackers were likely dissuaded by the possibility of being sent through a metal detector, as evidenced by the guns and knives janitors started finding in potted plants outside airport entrances, but this didn't dissuade enough of them. Hijackings continued until, in 1973, metal detectors became part of the mandatory screening process for everyone. It was at this point that the hijackings tapered off, and wouldn't reoccur until the early 2000s. \n\nSources:\n\nIf you're interested, I highly recommend the book \"The Skies Belong to Us: Love and Terror in the Golden Age of Hijacking.\" It's fascinating, and a really good read. \n\n[Some pictures](http://www.wired.com/2013/06/skyjacking-gallery/)\n\n[Another article](http://www.wired.com/2013/06/love-and-terror-in-the-golden-age-of-hijacking/)",

        "author": "DuvalEaton",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2j7pyx/some_columbus_day_context_that_lacks_facts/",
        "text": "(I just want to preface this by both saying this is my first badhistory submission and that I am merely a college student armed with the power of Wikipedia, skepticism, and Google so if I make any gross errors feel free to call me out.)\n\nColumbus Day was yesterday and the holiday named after the (in)famous explorer never ceases to cause controversy. In this particular case I ran across a twitter post and a link to a blog titled:\n\n\"[ICYMI: 1492 wasn't just some random year. Columbus' voyage was tied to the expulsion of Jews and Muslims from Spain](http://jessicawluther.com/2012/10/08/some-columbus-day-context/)\". \n\nNow I am well aware of the many scholarly criticisms of Columbus and why it is problematic to celebrate his legacy to say the least, from his erroneous belief in opposition to the vast majority of experts in geography in Europe at the time that the world was much smaller than really was, one that would have probably lead to his demise. His reportedly ruthless behavior towards the Taino people in Hispanola and his administration of the Santo Domingo colony that resulted in his dismissal as governor and near imprisonment, not to even start to mention the wider implications that his beginning of the process of European colonization in the Americans would have. However this blog post seeks to connect the Iberian forced conversion/expulsion of it's Jewish and Muslim populations to the legacy of Columbus and Columbus Day that seems to lack any sort of real sourcing while also serving to be pretty sloppily researched in it's content.\n\nThe blog starts out ok, no real examples I can see of badhistory till we get to where the author lays out essentially their only claims to the connection between to the Muslim/Jewish expulsions and the voyages of Columbus.\n\n\"He had asked Ferdinand and Isabella multiple times to back his voyage but as they were in the middle of a long war, they continually said no. With the capture of Granada and a major portion of Jews and Muslims cast out of their lands, the king and queen finally had a stable government over which to rule. And it was a government in need of money.\n\nBelieving foreign commerce, trade, and empire were keys to their future prosperity and deciding that the possible benefits in backing Columbus’ outweighed the overall monetary risk, they finally capitulated to his request. Columbus, as much as Ferdinand and Isabella, believed he was going to find them a quicker route to Asia, the richest part of the world at that time.\"\n\nWhile the Alhambra Decree issued in March of 1492 did indeed [mandate the immediate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhambra_Decree) expulsion or forced conversion of the Jews, the Muslim practicing \"[Mudejares](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mud%C3%A9jar)\" protected under the [Treaty of Granada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Granada_(1491) along with similar populations in Aragon in 1492 would still enjoy official tolerance in their open practice of Islam. I would not be until 1500 following Moorish revolts in Granada that the policy would shift and [even then more gradually to the same sort of forced conversions or expulsions](http://www.historytoday.com/roger-boase/muslim-expulsion-spain). There were no mass expulsions of Muslims from Castille or Aragon in 1492 so their connection to Columbus' first voyage seems tenuous.\n\nNow I may simply be not reading it right, but the author does not really not really seem explain there why the expulsion of the Jews and Muslims from Spain and the voyages of Columbus are linked, beyond apparently occurring, at least in the case of the Jews, at around the same time. Over Twitter I asked the author if she could further explain why there was a connection in her mind, her response was this.\n\n\"they refused to fund him while at war. Once war over - literally JUST ended - they funded him in hopes of making $$.\"\n\n\"financial connection btwn $$ spent to expel Jews and Muslims and their desire to make $$ off Columbus. The end.\"\n\nNow the war against Granada was certainly costly to the Castilian crown, but there is no evidence I can find of the being more than bringing the Emirate of Granada under Castilian control, not to bring about the expulsion of all Jews and Muslims. Not to mention Queen Isabella faced [debts left over by her predecessor King Henry IV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_I_of_Castile#Finances) and the costs of the [War of the Castilian Succession and the unfavorable settlement Castille](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_I_of_Castile#War_with_Portugal) agreed to, one that also barred Castilian colonization in the Atlantic were all factor a lot more in the gamble of Columbus' expedition then the \"costs\" of the expulsion of the Jews. In fact more likely than not the Crown would have at least temporarily gained money in it's seizure of property left behind by their formerJjewish subjects, so the assertion that somehow Columbus' voyages were being used to some how fund Castille and Aragons' expulsion of Jewish and Muslim subjects seems rather spurious.\n\nThere are further examples of bad history, that may be a bit pedantic but I still feel the need to point out.\n\nThe author goes on to talk about Columbus in the post, claiming:\n\n\"Columbus returned to the Americas three more times over the next 12 years. He transported men and domesticated animals. He brought slaves to and from the Caribbean (native Caribbean people went to Europe, Africans were shipped to the Americas).\"\n\nThere is, as far as I know, no evidence to support that Columbus ever transported African slaves to the Americas. The earliest mention I can find of African slaves being imported to the Americas [is in 1502](http://www.brycchancarey.com/slavery/chrono3.htm). While Columbus' fourth and final voyage was indeed in 1502, the voyage did not intend to land in any of the established Spanish colonies, only landing in Hispaniola due to threat of a hurricane, so it is unlikely any ship in the expedition would have carried any African slaves.\n\nThe final bit of bad history has to do with Bartolome de las Casas a Spanish settler and conquistador turned monk and advocate for humane treatment of indigenous people under Spanish rule. \n\n\"Bartoleme de las Casas, a priest who traveled with Columbus, published a scathing picture of the “new world” under the leadership of Columbus and the Spaniards who followed him. The “Black Legend”, as de las Casas’ work was called, was published in the 16th century and it showed cruelty, greed, and un-Christian-like behavior in its worst forms. It was an incredibly popular work (and one which, instead of serving as a warning to other European empires, served as an excuse. “At least we aren’t as bad as Spain”).\"\n\nFirst off, Las Casas never traveled with Columbus, (the author may be confusing him with his father, who did). [He arrived in Hispaniola in 1502 on the expedition of Nicolas de Ovando, at the same time as Columbus was on his final voyage in the Carribean, and De Casas did not at least, witness the administration of the Santo Domingo colony under Columbus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartolom%C3%A9_de_las_Casas#Background_and_arrival_in_the_New_World). Also the author incorrectly refers to his account of Spanish colonialism as \"The Black Legend\". \"The Black Legend\" is [in fact a term invented in 1914 to refer perception of the spread of Anti-Spanish propaganda in the 16th-17th centuries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Legend) which was in part at least related to De Casas' work.\n\nTo conclude there is plenty to discuss about the legacy of Columbus, the legitimacy of Columbus Day, and the colonization of the Americas. However inventing connections or engaging in sloppy fact checking to try and make an ideological point, even if it may be a good one, serves to not only weaken the real perception of the past in exchange for half-truth narratives and strengthens the hand of people with possibly discriminatory agendas who will gladly use the same tactics. \n\nEdit: Did some snooping and I think I found the source of at least the badhistory regarding Las Casas. [This guy also seems to think Las Casas was a member of Columbus' crew](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eric-kasum/columbus-day-a-bad-idea_b_742708.html) and witnessed his administration in Santo Domingo. It also includes other badhistory \"[Taino had no weapons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta%C3%ADno#Culture)\", [vastly inflating population numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta%C3%ADno#Population_decline) (San Salvador had a pop of 125k?) and some other weird stuff (JFK never did anything morally questionable? Vietnam?). I wonder if this is where the author got the idea that Las Casas traveled with Columbus or whether the badhistory rabbit hole goes even deeper?",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2j6xmh/apartheid_wasnt_all_that_bad_some_minor/",
        "text": "/r/worldnews isn't exactly what I'm looking for when it comes to good history and politics. In all honesty I'm subscribed to read the headlines and articles, and I try not to venture into the comments. That being said, I will take a gander if I'm interested in the topic. Just today we've got an article from news24: [\"South African president wanted corruption charges dropped because corruption is a 'Western thing'\"](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2j46nj/south_african_president_wanted_corruption_charges/). I already posted an analysis of [this thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/badpolitics/comments/2j6c49/the_second_coming_of_apartheid_hint_this_time_its/) to /r/badpolitics because a lot of comments talk about the policies in effect since the end of Apartheid and unfortunately I can't discuss about them. However, there's definitely some nuggets of bad history that I feel like I should note.  \nNow while the whole thread talks more about politics and recent times, there is significant talk of the history of South Africa during Apartheid.  \n[One comment](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2j46nj/south_african_president_wanted_corruption_charges/cl88ypp) in particular brings up the discussion of South African history. It was the top comment at the time I saw this thread but now that I've taken the time to sit down and write this out, it's shifted to second place. Still, the children of this top comment constitute a large chunk of the post. Let's see what reddit thinks about Apartheid.  \n&gt;South Africa has really gone to shit in the last 20 years. (+572)  \n\nTo take more of a historical spin on this, the implications of the comment imply that South Africa was far better under Apartheid than it is now. Of course, what was so good about Apartheid? It was pretty bad, right? I mean that's why there were significant protests and boycotts of the country during the National Party's reign. Clearly this wasn't a good thing for South Africans, so the end of it has to have improved at least something. Further discussion leads to comments bringing up Mbeki, and Black Economic Empowerment. This is quite a controversial policy, and it's not without its critics. That being said, there's a much easier historical comparison we could make here that doesn't overexaggerate at all.\n&gt;That sounds just as racist as the policies during apartheid. (+256)\n\nThis one really took me off guard, and where the thread inevitably takes a turn for the worse. You heard it here, Black Economic Empowerment is pretty much equivalent to the policies of Apartheid. In addition to incentivizing companies to hire blacks in economic positions, BEE also prevented whites from voting, stripped them of their citizenship, and forced them into crowded Blancostans where they faced police discrimination, extreme poverty, and crime. Oh wait, no it didn't. That was Apartheid. The fundamental misunderstanding in this comment (and how highly upvoted it is) shows me that perhaps people really don't understand what happened under Apartheid, and ideology behind it. The disconnect here is staggering. Second reply down:  \n\n&gt;Apparently, only white racists are bad. (+106)\n&gt;&gt;Uganda of Idi Amin kicked out Asians, none batted the eyes. Africa for Africans but the whole world is open for them. (+51)\n\nYou know, Idi Amin. If there's anything nobody cares about, it's the atrocities committed by Idi Amin. Luckily someone sane comes in with at +42 critiquing this idea, but the comment about Amin remains highly upvoted despite both it and the critical reply visible. \n\nLuckily, a brave redditor decides to deal out the truth about Apartheid despite it being so politically incorrect.\n\n&gt;It's unpopular to say because of how politically incorrect this is, but life in South Africa was far better under apartheid. These idiots who are in power now have no idea how to run a country, unless you count running it into the ground. (+72)  \n\nIt's a pretty common point that to make among Apartheid apologists that South Africa was truly so much better under Apartheid. I mean, just ask any ~~average~~ white South African. Of course, most black South Africans who lived through Apartheid would probably tell you otherwise. The thing is, life under Apartheid probably was slightly better *for whites*. They aren't as favored by the government. Many black South Africans are still poor today as well. The difference is that now they can go wherever they want, they can vote, and they at least have a shot at getting some education and a better job than they could have in Apartheid. And they're actually considered full citizens now.\n\n&gt;Apartheid want what made the country work though. It is what set the country up to be declining power it is today. Uneducated people have the most emotional responses to politics and obviously don't understand policy, so they latch on to things that make them feel good. BEE is horrible policy, but it made black voters feel good because they had been oppressed so long they thought it would make things better if the whites payed for what they did. Revenge doesn't make for good economic policy (+98)\n&gt;&gt;Except that black people had a higher standard of education under apartheid rule than they do now . Along with better healthcare , less unemployment and less crime. Yes Apartheid was bad , but the country was run significantly better. (+22)  \n\nOne thing about apartheid that's crucial to remember is that black South Africans were stripped of their citizenship, which let the white authorities in the National Party wave a hand at taking statistics in the Bantustans. Residents of these areas faced significant health care problems, unemployment, and crime. The problem was that nobody was writing it down, so nobody knew. When the ANC took control in 1994, all the problems that had occurred during Apartheid were now shown in the public light. Of course, since these issues got more scrutiny after Apartheid ended, they were attributed to the 1994 administration and their followers.  \n\n&gt;Under apartheid everybody could go to the hospital or to school or get a job. Now they can't. It was a LOT better for everybody because competent people were in charge. (+16)  \n\nSimilar to the last assertion, more ideas that black South Africans had it better under Apartheid. The thing is, information from the Apartheid era was extremely censored and kept quiet by the National Party administration. They truly wanted people (particularly white South Africans and others around the world) to think that black South Africans actually wanted to live under Apartheid, when in reality there wasn't a lot of care put into the living standards of the Bantustans. It's always surprising to see that this kind of rhetoric has persisted today.  \nWhen I first saw the thread a few hours ago it was pretty bad, but luckily there are a few people who are coming in and clearing up some of the misconceptions. They're more toward the bottom, though -- the overall trend is that Apartheid was so much better, and the current policies are going to drive them into the ground.\n",

The idea that it is \"our burden\" as enlightened Westerners to speed up the progress of other peoples toward our idea of what is the correct form of society is based in this notion that all societies occupy rungs on a single ladder of civilization.",

        "text": "http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2j0t1k/you_are_sent_to_the_middle_ages_you_can_take_one/\n\n&gt;If, during the Medieval Age, you had a simple hand-powered machine that could make a finely textured dairy based ice cream that could be flavored with extracts of local fruits and/or honey...you'd become a powerful and rich merchant like the Medicis. You'd branch out into banking, overseas trade, and politics. You and your descendants would be the defacto rulers of some city-state for centuries afterwards. You yourself would found a dynasty, wield influence over (or possibly directly control) Kings and religious figures. You would bank-roll armies, affect laws and policies to suit your aims. All from the background and with little direct threat to yourself.\n\nSo, similar to spaghetti, an Ice cream churn allows one to become the ruler of the known world (Or at least a small city state). Never mind that any mechanical Ice-cream churn requires quite a bit of salt, which is expensive, and that shipping your ice cream (which, as it is full of air and therefore less dense than Ice, itself tough to ship for long distances, will be nearly impossible to move) to make any kind of profit outside of your very small area, requires infrastructure and technology that is non-existent. Additionally, once anyone sees your churn, your monopoly on the thing itself disappears, as any relatively skilled carpenter can get the thing made. This, of course, is discounting the realities of language issue that existed in the Spaghetti post. \n\n&gt;A modern marine expeditionary force and I'd take over the Roman empire.\n\nWhich Roman Empire? When in the middle ages are we? Are we taking over the Byzantines? Are we taking over the HRE? Conquering the Pope and asking/ordering him to turn over the eternal city? How well equipped is our Marine expeditionary force equipped to keep going once what they have on them goes? manufacturing to keep your people in an advantageous position of power? \n\n&gt;And I won't survive for long if I cannot digest the food of the day. All they really ate back then was gruel, mutton, and roadkill. This type of diet would simply destroy my already sensitive insides. In order to keep my internals from spilling out my butthole within the first two days, I would bring back some probiotics. Then I could get to work on making the world a better place.\nI'd teach doctors of the day to wash their hands before performing surgeries or handling vagina. Then, I would teach the chefs and linecooks about the cross contamination that can occur when handling raw meat and vagina (many doctors back then held second jobs). Finally, I'd get to work on scoring with some lady folk. Shouldn't be difficult. Even now, middle aged women adore me. I could teach them modern lovemaking techniques. The kind that only come with a lot of free time and a high speed internet connection.\n\nOK, While this post is obviously partly joking, here's something that I actually know more than just a teensy bit about: French and English (and a bit of German) Medieval cuisine. Gruel, Mutton, Roadkill. While the public perception of the culinary arts in the middle ages are not great, in actuality, peasants ate relatively well, with a pretty nutritionally balanced diet. Vegetables were pretty accessible, eggs provided protein, and even meat was accessible relatively often (even if they were mostly poorer cuts which take forever to make tender). Most peasant households had a form of \"Eternal Stew\" (many of which have evolved into high-cuisine dishes like a Boeuf Bourguignon, Coq au Vins, Irish Stew, Carbonnade) which would be left on the hearth pretty much forever, with new fresh ingredients tossed in the morning to supplement the current ingredients while working in the field. And, while, yes, starvation was a danger, it wasn't the ever-present specter that common perception presents it as. Additionally, while there were some professional ideological crossovers between Doctors and Cooks, there was no way that one would jump from one profession to the other. Sure, medieval cuisine subscribed to the four humors (but who didn't,) and meals had to be balanced along those axes (a cold, wet dish, such as cold fish, was meant to be paired with a hot, dry drink, like white wine,) but professionally, become a cook (and I presume a doctor) was a long, taxing journey, bringing you from scullion to spit-turner to apprentice to travelling the roads as a journeyman and learning the different aspects of the medieval kitchen under a master Queux. The most successful even became minor nobles, of which Guillaume Tirel, \"Taillevent,\" at the court of the first Valois king is perhaps the most famous, writing a treatise that is considered the basis of modern fine-cuisine. \n\nI'm sure there's a lot more, and that I barely scratch the surface here.\n\nEdit: I wrote a paper on medieval cuisine, if anyone is interested in reading it.\n\nEdit 2: Here's the paper, sorry it's on wordpress, it's just the easiest link to it I have right now: http://thomasberubeg.wordpress.com/2013/04/22/a-glorious-feast-an-overview-of-cooks-and-cooking-in-medieval-aristocratic-settings-2012/",

        "text": "So apparently Extra Credit's \"Extra History\" has already ended with [today's video.](http://youtu.be/WukYrrTH3ms) Which is a shame as the previous ones [were quite entertaining in their wrongness.](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2hy2jr/extra_credits_does_wwi_the_seminal_badhistory/) Which means we'll have to savour this one.\n\n&gt; It's a dim night. A group of haggard looking men sit in a room in the ministry in Belgrade. One of them holds the Austrian ultimatum in his hands. They've spent the day debating on a reply. Defeated, they're about to give in to all demands.  \nA note is slipped under the door; it says that the Russians have started to mobilise... they change the reply and the final act begins. (0:09)\n\nThe Serbian reply is handed to Austria at 17:55 in the evening, 5 minutes before the time would have run out. Hardly a \"dim night\" on the 25^th of July. Then when we also consider that the Serbian government had started a general mobilisation of its troops at 15:00 the same day there isn't really a question that the final decision fell more around noon, not late at night.\n\nUnless of course this scenario is supposed to have happened the night before. But then that note about Russian mobilisation must have come from the future since the Russian General Staff's preparation of the first regions (Odessa, Kiev, Kazan and Muscovy) for mobilisations only became public on the 25^th as well. \n\n&gt; [The Serbian] reply is a masterstroke. An act of genius in the way it concludes. For, at the end, it says that if the Austrians don't find their terms to be fair the Serbians are more than willing to submit to the resolution of a conference. But, if you remember, the Austrians hate conferences - they are *always* getting outvoted at those things. (0:40)\n\nAlmost! If you speak French, here's the original final paragraph: \n\n&gt; &gt; Dans le cas où le Gouvernement I. et R. ne serait pas satisfait de cette réponse, le Gouvernement Royal serbe, considérant qu'il est d l'intérêt commun de ne pas précipiter la solution de cette question, est prêt comme toujours d'accepter une entente pacifique, soit en remettant cette question à la décision du Tribunal International de la Haye soit aux Grandes Puissances qui ont pris part à l'élaboration de la déclaration que le Gouvernement serbe a faite le l8/31 mars 1909.\n\nIn essence, Serbia says that it is in everyone's best interest to not hasten this solution and is more than willing to submit to the international court in The Hague or a tribunal of the not directly involved Great Powers (Great Britain, France, Italy and Germany). \n\nBoth of those would have taken the decision completely out of Austria's hands, unacceptable when you are already dead-set on war, and both options had already been suggested by British foreign minister Edward Grey on the 24^th and declined.\n\n&gt; [The Austrians] are livid at the Serbian reply. (1:02)\n\nNot the ones who knowingly drafted an unacceptable document as a pretense for war... In fact, if I may quote Maurice de Bunsen, British ambassador to Austria-Hungary, in a letter to his government on the 24^th: “War is thought imminent. Wildest enthusiasm prevails in Vienna.”\n\n&gt; [...] Berchtold returns to Austria-Hungary and, for the first time, speaks with Conrad von Hötzendorf, the Chief-of-Staff for the Austrian army. He, too, is apoplectic: \"What? Declare war? You needed to tell us *weeks* ago that's what you wanted to do, the Austrian army won't be ready for war until the 14^th of August. Weeks from now!\"\n\nSpeaking for the first time since *when*? Von Berchtold and von Hötzendorf had been working closely to drive the country to war for the past month. If anything, von Hötzendorf would have been ecstatic that the war he had been campaigning for for a decade was about to start. Plus the army couldn't have been mobilised without the Emperor's signature and even though Franz Joseph at that time was an old and weak-willed man he had held on to his high hopes for a peaceful solution and could only be coerced into signing the necessary war documents after the Serbian ultimatum had bounced on the evening of the 25^th of July. And even then, from the video you'd guess Austria would rush to get every man ready for war immediately because every day counts... except that mobilisation of the Austro-Hungarian army would not happen before the 31^st and only after von Hötzendorf was urged by his German colleague von Moltke to urgently get started.\n\nSome minor nitpicking: Conrad von Hötzendorf was the Chief of General Staff of the complete Austro-Hungarian forces. This because while the Empire had a single army (*Gemeinsame Armee*) under control of a joint ministry, both individual countries had been granted their own militia in the Ausgleich, which had over the past decades turned into much better equipped and trained forces at the cost of the k.u.k. Army. Consequently, the COS for the *Austrian* army would have been Friedrich Freiherr von Georgi.\n\n&gt; Meanwhile in Russia, Sazonov gets reports of Austrians shelling Belgrade. These reports are false of course, the Austrian army won't be ready to do anything until August 14^th [...] (4:32)\n\nIf this \"meanwhile\" is in reference to Kaiser Wilhelm II.'s suggestion of only occupying Belgrade that would be the 27^th of July, so indeed false reports. \n\nHowever, the Austrian's *did* shell Belgrade. At 1:00 in the morning on the 29^th of July the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine fired the first shots, led by the Danube gunboat [SMS Inn](http://www.cityofart.net/bship/sms_inn.jpg) and a convoy of monitors that had been sent on their way down the Danube even before the official declaration had been made. \n\nI suspect Extra Credit's claim here is an amalgamation of the actual shelling of Belgrade and the false account of a Serbian attack on the Hungarian border at Temes Kubin told to the Emperor to get him to sign the actual declaration.\n\n&gt; At the end of these correspondences Nicholas picks up the phone, calls Yanushkevich and tells him to call off the general mobilisation. (6:05)\n\nDid you know that the Tsar actually turned the general mobilisation into a partial one just against Austria, even though Austria had thus far not mobilised against Russia? You probably didn't if you only watched that video because that is not important enough to be mentioned.\n\n&gt; And so the dominos start to fall. But there is one last attempt, one last try to stop that crushing chain of reality [...] Portalés [German ambassador to Russia], has one last meeting with Sazonov [...]  (8:26)\n\nSo much drama...\n\nAnyway, the last meeting between the two I know of is in the wake of the Austrian declaration of war, after which Portalés writes back home to Chancellor Hollweg about how Russia is willing to pressure Serbia into accepting the full ultimatum to avoid war, only to have the notion rejected outright.\n\n.\n\nIn conclusion, this episode is much better than the last ones, but mainly because episode 2 couldn't even get the most basic of Wikipedia facts straight while this one seems more like ignoring details for the sake of a gritty narrative.  \nIn any case, if they actually still do an extra episode about all their errors as they said last time I'm sure we'll need to have a close look at that as well.",

        "text": "From /r/worldnews: [Bones in Tomb Belong to Macedonian King Philip II, Father of Alexander the Great—He suffered from frontal &amp; maxillary sinusitis likely from old facial trauma. He was blinded when eye hit with arrow in siege of Methone in 354 BC. Woman warrior, likely daughter of Scythian King Ateas, is with him.](https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2ixo6y/bones_in_tomb_belong_to_macedonian_king_philip_ii/)\n\nAn otherwise fascinating news piece on an interesting discovery gives /r/worldnews the chance not to talk about the findings, or even Philip himself, but to jump right into the true fact of the universe: the Greeks ruled the world, and everything in it.\n\nTop comment:\n\n&gt;WOW. This is huge. Philip was integral in the expansion of Macedon and the reforming of the army. He was on the verge of invading Persia himself until his untimely death. Without this man, without his widespread reforms, Persia would never have been conquered so easily.. Or at all.. By him or Alexander. Amazing.\n\nPretty much within the bounds of fact.\n\nResponse:\n\n&gt;&gt;One can certainly argue that if it weren't for him, the west would have never looked like it does today. In terms of one man being integral in the shaping of the future, this man is right up there with Leonidas, and his son. You know, I'd say the Greeks are probably the most important civilization in history. They have by far had the largest impact on western development. (+67)\n\nOkie-dokie, here we gokie. \n\nThe whole bit of \"in terms of shaping the future,\" Philip and Leonidas as \"right up there\" - that's a little murky, I think, but it's not *bad* bad history, it's just a bit of the old idle speculation.\n\nBut \"the most important civilization in history?\" Explicitly *because* they impacted *western* development?\n\nThis commenter doesn't assert why or how, they just say \"I think maybe it is,\" so there's not really a way to tell why or how they are wrong. It is conceivable, I guess, for them to be altogether correct; if there were an arbiter-god of history, and it ranked \"history\" into discrete and quantifiable units of import, then maybe Greece *would* beat out literally every single other civilization in every era in every part of the globe. I wouldn't know, I'm not an arbiter-god of history.\n\nSo instead of sticking with this comment, let's let the rest of /r/worldnews hash it out for us.\n\n&gt;Easy now. The Greeks are likely the most important civilization in *western* history. (+47)\n\n&gt;&gt;Except the ones in the \"east\", like the scholars of Babylon who actually saved the writings of the Greeks and others. Later peoples like the ravenous Christians burned all those writings and without those copies made by smart and inquisitive Arabs they would have been lost forever.\n\nSo this is a little tricky, actually. The first guy goes, \"Don't be a eurocentrist, Greece impacted Europe, not the whole world,\" and the counter-response is \"except for the eastern parts they did impact, like Babylon and Arabia.\" Is that a fair and faithful categorization of the past? Was Babylon and Arabia the \"East,\" and thus the whole world? *Did* \"ravenous Christians\" burn everything?\n\nLike, I can agree with the concept that \"smart Arabs preserved Greek writings,\" but I can't do so in the contextual agenda of, \"and therefore the Greeks actually DID impact the entire universe.\"\n\nThis wouldn't be badhistory without a mention of the following piece of chartism...\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;This fact, here, pisses me off so incredibly. When the crusaders razed the Imperial Library in Constantinople, I'm positive we lost tons of valuable and unique information that could help us with a very large part of history.\nEdit - I was referring to the destruction in 1204 C.E. I did not intend this to be an Anti-Christian, Anti-Muslim, or anti-theistic post. I was just lamenting the loss of, probably, some amazing history.\n\nOh, poor pissed-off person! Lament us your losses for the ten thousandth time!\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Didn't a Muslim army burn the library of Alexandria?\n\nOkay, now I'm moving back a few levels to the responses to the comment that begins, \"Easy now.\" And to a precisely *bad* piece of history.\n\n&gt;Then the West went and pretty much Conquered the world for 400 years (by actual occupation or cultural occupation). To say that the progenitor of that culture is only important to the West is silly. That is like saying the Sumerians are only one of the most important Civilizations to the Middle East, no, just no. (+9)\n\nLet's unpack this. Ancient Greece *absolutely is* the most awesome and important culture in all history, because:\n\n1. *Ancient Greece \"Conquered the world\" from 336 BC to, what, 64 AD?* No, they didn't! As absolutely awe-inspiring, historically-unbelievable and super-masculine Alexander's conquests were, does [this look like the whole world to you?](http://www.liceodongnocchi.eu/wp-content/docenti/puglia_simone/empire-of-alexander-the-great-large-map.jpg) It's a lot of the world to the ancients Greeks, sure, but we aren't ancient Greeks! We know about the \"hidden kingdoms\" of Southeast Asia! We know about the sub-Saharan! We know about *America!* And hell, the \"Greeks\" didn't really have much of a say-so on Europe itself during that time, did it? It's just outright, blatant, unavoidable grecophilia and western-centrism to argue that, because of Alexander, the Greeks obviously impacted the entire world more than anyone in world history. \n\n2. *\"By actual occupation or cultural occupation\"*. Remember when the Greeks occupied Japan? I can't, actually. Was that one a cultural occupation or an \"actual\" occupation?\n\n3. *Because of Alexander's conquests, all of the Americas, Asia, Africa, Polynesia, and any other conceivable nation, culture, people, or simply geographical entity, is not only impacted by Greece, but impacted by Greece more than any other collection of cities.* Bullshit! How can you even refute this? \n\n&gt;&gt;When did the west go and conquer the ENTIRE world? (-11)\n\nDownvotes for you, bitch!\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;The British Empire alone covered nearly 1/4 of the globe. (+11)\n\nBritish Empire: not exactly contemporary with the period in question, is it? And even as mind-blowing as imperial Britain was, 1/4 of the globe is simply not factually equivalent to the *entire* world, is it?\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The British Empire was 400 years after Alexander the Great? Da fuk? (-1)\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Nobody claimed the British Empire was 400 years after Alexander, moron. Learn to read. The poster was asserting that Europeans dominated the world for a 400 year period of time, which is a stretch to be sure, but it was still very clear what they were saying.\n\nNow I'm just starting to get fucking muddled-up in what is actually being asserted in terms of historical interpretation and what is just arbitrary counter-pointing. So now the argument is that the West rules because Europeans ruled the world for 400 years, and therefore Greece? \n\nAnd you're *literally* an illiterate moron if you are confused by any of that.\n\nMoving back up the comment chain a few levels:\n\n&gt;&gt;I don't know why you're being down voted. Saying the Greeks are the most important civilization ever is extremely West-centric, and ignores groups which existed entirely independent of Western contact for millennia following Phillip and Alexander's death. (+7)\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;While it is indeed very west centric, the fact remains that Western/European culture is the dominant culture on the planet and has been since the late middle ages. Western culture has had a massive impact on all countries in the world. Recent (last several hundred years) history of the world has simply been very west centric as Europe (and in the 20th century the US) has dominated the planet.\nSo if the greeks did indeed have a profound effect on shaping western culture, and western culture has become the dominant culture on the planet, then yes, the greek civilization can be said to be (one of) the most important civilizations in history. (+42)\n\nObviously this is just more of the same, but notice the vote patterns we've been seeing. \n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;For fucks sake. Yes, we are all aware that there are other cultures on the planet, but we don't run first world countries on ideas and philosophies hashed out by the Aztecs do we? (+18)\n\nTake *that*, Aztecs! (???)\n\nAnd then my absolute favorite comment in this entire thread:\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\"Saying the Greeks are the most important civilization ever is extremely West-centric\" Not really. Western culture has had (and still has) a huge impact on the entire world. Especially if you consider things like Human Rights or Reason to be universal values / discoveries of humanity.\n\nDING DING DING! **HUMAN RIGHTS,** Y'ALL! **REASON,** COMRADES!\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Not like Arabs ever had human rights or reason or advanced mathematics or astronomy. Oh wait...\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What I said was not \"against\" any group or society. But after living 20 years all over the world, in most major civilizations, I noticed that Reason is primarily found in those places most influenced by European settlers.\nSame for Human Rights that still is seen in ~~most~~ all places largely as a Western idea.\n\nI have no coherent rebuttal to this one. It's giving this comment too much respect to even attempt an R5 for it. He even has the gall to deliberately strike-out \"most\" and replace it with \"all!\" Why would you ever do that, and not the other way around? \n\nTo round this shitstorm out, here's just a smattering of the comments - by a smattering, I mean, almost a complete sample - of the ones that follow the original \"don't be west-centric\" comment. They all have positive karma:\n\n&gt;No holds barred the Greeks were arguably one of the most important civilizations in terms of influence on human history. Has nothing to do with east/west, though certainly west-centric thinking will exaggerate that point. It remains a true point.\n\n#\n\n&gt;Hellenic cultural influence stretched from southern France and north Africa to northwest India and the western extremities of what is today China. The Greeks had a massive influence on a huge swath of the ancient world either directly or via later Roman adaptation. It wasn't just \"the west\" at all.\n\n#\n\n&gt;Which as of the 21st century, all of the world is the West. For the most part.\n\n#\n\n&gt;Not only Western history, if we think of Human Rights and Reason as universal values for the future of humanity.\n\n#\n\n&gt;Seriously don't know why you're being down voted. The western world (aka Europe and a few neighboring areas) definitely does not equal all of the world. I thought most people were taught this in basic history?\n\nPsych! They don't *all* have positive karma - this last one? -9! \n\n-----\n\nAs a final bit, here's a humorous exchange in that thread, which should give you an idea of the type of people we are dealing with - not historians, obviously, or even people who have had a passing but honest engagement with classics whatsoever, but people who like to read things and intuit a response to them:\n\n&gt;Allegedly, when Alexander the Great met the philosopher Diogenes of Sinope:\n*Alexander found the philosopher looking attentively at a pile of human bones. Diogenes explained, \"I am searching for the bones of your father but cannot distinguish them from those of a slave.\"*\n\n&gt;&gt;That seems more of a \"We're all the same in death.\" type of statement than Diogenes not being able to find the bones.\n\nAnother redditor independently analyzes the ancient world and offers up his unbelievable insight onto his fellow non-historians and non-classicists and non-philosophers and non-hobbyists of /r/worldnews about what was *really* going on then. Nevermind that he's completely right in this instance; it's indicative of the sort of attitude present: an un-informed and intuitive one.\n\n\n",

I'm a sucker for this sort of hyper-religious revisionism, and I just can't resist digging into it. The full text of the video is on the same site, so you can read that, but I highly recommend the video. The monotone narration is glorious.\n\nTo give a little context, this is a video about Leif Erikson and his discovery of North America. Its basic assertion is that because Leif Erikson was a Christian, America is a Christian nation. Really, I'd like to talk about it in the context of greater bad history surrounding Norse colonisation of Greenland and North America, but let's start with what we have, shall we?\n\nAt :16, we hear the sentence \"America was founded as a Christian nation.\" There is all sorts of debate and discussion that this brings up. It's huge. What do the actions of the nation's founders mean? Does it matter more than their words? Rather than delve into every section of this debate (which would, inevitably, bring me over rule 2), I'll let [people](http://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1yohed/irl_bad_history_in_god_we_trust_is_on_our_money/cfmcevu) who [know this debate better than I do](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/12pakz/was_america_founded_as_a_christian_nation_or_a/) answer this. Essentially, while the majority of scholars say \"no\" - and have good reason for doing so - a case can be made that the very philosophies upon which the Constitution and American political thought were based were themselves inspired by Christian thought and ideals, meaning that regardless of whether or not people like Adams and Jefferson *intended* to create a Christian nation, they did so anyway because their thoughts were so conditioned. However, it is, as always, telling to note that there is no mention of God or Christianity in the Constitution, and that documents like the [Treaty of Tripoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Tripoli) explicitly state that the US isn't a Christian nation. Of course, the trouble there is that that's John Adams writing, and John Adams does not represent the sum total of the philosophies that went into the founding of the US, so it can't be taken as being absolutely definitive. However, my point here is that to claim \"America was founded as a Christian nation; there’s no doubt about that\" is wrong. \n\nAt :23, the narrator says \"To prove that, we could go back to the very beginning.\" There are two things to say about this. First, if it's his goal to assert that going back to the very first discovery of America will prove that it's a Christian nation, I have some bad news for him. America was discovered by Native Americans [roughly 15000 years ago](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/07/mystery-of-native-americans-arrival/). While it's still unclear who these first settlers were or when exactly they arrived, it is overwhelmingly likely that they arrived in the Americas long before the existence of Christianity. In fact, the first century CE has [the Maya beginning their collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization), [Teotihuacan thriving and building massive monuments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teotihuacan), and the [Zapotecs were expanding into new territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapotec_civilization). All of this suggests that it's unlikely that going back in time will reveal that America was definitely first discovered by Christians. Also, that clock in the video is going forwards, not backwards.\n\nAt :27, the narrator says \"We could go back to our founding fathers.\" Once again, this is a matter of some debate, and one which I feel is covered by what I've written and linked above.\n\nAt :28, we hear \"The pilgrims.\" This one is interesting. It can't be denied that the Pilgrims were rather religious. The group defined itself as a congregation, and one of the reasons they left the Netherlands was because of fears of the congregation breaking apart as some members headed back to England. Both Winslow and Bradford were concerned about Dutch influence on members of their group, and Winslow, certainly, was interested in being a missionary to the Native Americans. Granted, first contact with the natives of New England didn't go to terribly well - Bradford describes robbing the Native Americans and shooting at them - but there was eventually contact. The *Mayflower Compact* is full of religious language, and the settlers at Plymouth and the other settlers who later followed them there were unquestionably of a decidedly religious bent. It's also in New England and the New England colonies that we find phenomena like the [First Great Awakening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Great_Awakening), which undoubtedly had an impact on how the colonists of the 13 colonies viewed themselves and their position vis a vis England by furthering an ideal of knowledge as a self-led endeavour and governance as a social contract. However, these are ideals that don't necessarily relate to Christianity, raising the question of whether or not the Pilgrims can be said to be an example of how the US is a Christian nation. Their background is in Christianity, but their legacy and impact on the founding of the nation was more with regards to instilling a sense of self-determination than a long-term religious goal. Indeed, according to [this website](http://www.great-awakening.com/?page_id=22), Puritans and Anglicans represented a little over 2% of the Christian population by 1790, implying that it was not their brand of Christianity or its beliefs that attracted people, but the ideas that could be taken from it.\n\nAt :33, the narrator says \"We could go back to Christopher Columbus.\" At this point, I can't help but feel he's really stretching if he's including Columbus as evidence that the US is a Christian nation (especially since Columbus never made it to the US), but let's go with it, for the sake of argument. Christopher Columbus was a religious man, no denying that (though some, hilariously, have [claimed the Columbus was Jewish](http://us.cnn.com/2012/05/20/opinion/garcia-columbus-jewish/index.html?hpt=hp_c2)). According to [this article](http://moses.creighton.edu/csrs/news/F92-1.html), he saw his purpose in his voyage as being one of not only finding gold and glory for Spain and for himself, but as a mission from God. In his journals, he writes about the local Native Americans, saying \"I think they can very easily be made Christians, for they seem to have no religion.\" This shows that he did have an interest in converting the natives as well as all the other goals he had. However, it must once again be asked. Does the fact that Columbus was religious mean that America is a Christian nation? It must be kept in mind that Columbus was Catholic, a faith that wasn't shared by many of the nation's founders. It's unlikely that Columbus and his personal beliefs had too terribly much impact on the US and its political philosophies. Was Columbus religious, though? Yes, though I suspect the person in the video sees \"Catholic\" as only vaguely Christian. \n\nAt :55, the narrator describes Erik the Red as a \"very flamboyant gentleman who lived in Norway until he killed a man in self-defense.\" I have no idea what the narrator means by \"a very flamboyant gentleman,\" (unless it's a reference to the fact that Erik the Red had red hair), but I do understand \"killed people and ran like hell.\" That's not entirely accurate. It's true that Erik the Red was born in Norway, but after his father, Thorvald, killed some people, the family was banished, moving to Hornstrandir in Iceland. Erik was not at the murdering people point of his life yet. That came later, after Erik had grown up and built a farm in Haukadal where some of his thralls dropped a landslide on a neighbouring farm. The farmers killed the thralls, Erik killed the farmers, and no one was happy. Erik was banished and went to live in another part of Iceland called Öxney where he killed someone who had stolen the beams from the roof of his house. This got him banished from Iceland. Over the course of this, his children, Leif, Freydis, Thorvald, and Thorsteinn were born. After his banishment from Iceland (and having nowhere else to go), Erik elected to move to Greenland and establish a colony there. While others had tried to settle there in the past, Erik can be credited with the first successful settlement of Greenland. In 982, he journeyed there and spent three years exploring and mapping out the island. In 985, he returned to Iceland, recruiting others to help colonise the island. These recruitments were actually very successful, partly because of Erik's idea to name the island \"Greenland\" instead of \"Covered in ice and hostile natives land,\" and because of a famine in Iceland which made moving to a new place with fertile land very appealing. In 986, he established two colonies on the only two patches of arable land, and moved his family to Greenland. \n\nAt 1:06, we hear \"When Leif had achieved manhood, he wanted to return to his ancestreal [sic] home.\" Yes and no. Leif can better be described as having had wanderlust, and wanted to explore. Long after he became an adult (adulthood for the Norse meant 12 years old), Leif sailed from Greenland to Norway. He arrived there in 999 when he was around 29 years old. \n\nAt 1:35, our lovely narrator tells us that \"There, in Norway, he ran into Christians and was converted to Christ the Lord. He became a born again Christian.\" Well, if by \"ran into Christians,\" the narrator means \"met with the King of Norway, King Olaf I,\" then this is accurate. He was also converted to Christianity during this visit and charged with bringing Christianity back to Greenland. The inaccuracy comes in with the use of the phrase \"born again.\" This is a contentious phrase in Christian belief, with every denomination having a different definition of it. This can range from a simple conversion to a full water baptism and reawakening of one's faith. Catholics and Protestants, especially, have widely divergent views, with Catholics saying that \"born again\" simply means having been baptised (either as an infant or afterwards, though largely as an infant), and Protestants saying...many other things. I don't know the narrator's religious affiliation (though I admit, I am speculating about it rather heavily), but the site and the ads on it and the time period in which he's writing suggest a certain range of religious beliefs. Our lovely narrator most likely shares the belief that being \"born again\" follows Melton's definition, which describes it as \"an experience when everything they have been taught as Christians becomes real, and they develop a direct and personal relationship with God.\" Being a \"born again Christian\" in today's terms generally implies becoming part of Evangelical or Pentacostal Christianity. These movements can largely be seen as beginning with the [Azusa Street Revival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azusa_Street_Revival) in 1906, and gaining popularity throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Once again, there is decidedly more detail about these movements and their followers and implications that is fascinating, but I'll pass on the risk of violating rule 2. Suffice to say, though, Leif Erikson, while he did undergo a conversion to Christianity and did want to share his faith afterward to the point of bringing a priest back to Greenland with him, did not ascribe to Pentacostalism or modern Evangelicalism. \n\nAt 1:45, our humble narrator tells us that what Leif Erikson wanted most of all \"was to take his faith back to Iceland, and beyond.\" No. Leif Erikson wanted to go home. He had been charged with bringing Christianity to Greenland. \n\nAt 1:55, we are told that \"Leif went to Iceland and preached the Gospel for years and years.\" Considering he would go on to discover Vinland in 1003, it's unlikely Leif spent a great deal of time in Iceland. Also, he was going to Greenland. Also, one version of the Vinland Sagas has Leif discovering Vinland on his way back from Norway, which is unlikely, but still more likely than Leif spending \"years and years\" as an itinerant preacher in Iceland. Also, that's a map of Africa, not Iceland.\n\nAt 2:01, we learn that Leif and his priest buddy \"moved on to Greenland and continued to teach the word of Christ.\" This is true. Leif did help bring Christianity to Greenland, converting people to Christianity, including his mother. Indeed, his mother (Thjodhildr) commissioned Greenland's first church, much to her husband's displeasure. This is correct. What's not correct is the next bit.\n\nAt 2:08, we get \"They then moved on to the north-east tip of North America, which many say is today is what is now part of the United States of America. The first contact that this continent had with Europeans - they came for the proclamation of the gospel of Christ.\" Oh lawd. Well, I'll start with [this 16th century map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinland#mediaviewer/File:Sk%C3%A1lholt-Karte.png) of Norse America. It's not contemporary, so I'm a bit reluctant to put too much stock into it, but it does show a bit of what the Norse were thinking about when they started sailing. It also heavily suggests that Leif Erikson didn't sail to the US. Indeed, if the narrator is to be believed the \"northeast tip of North America\" is in Canada, not the US anyway. I'm not terribly inclined to believe him, though. Based on the descriptions in the Norse sagas, though, it's generally agreed upon that Erikson probably sailed past Baffin Island and eventually landed in Newfoundland. Later Norse expeditions might have gone further south, but Erikson probably didn't. Granted, it's not known for certain, and some of the debates place Erikson in Maine or even as far south as New York, but the majority scholarly opinion is that he landed in Newfoundland. \n\nThe worse history, though, is the idea that Leif went to North America to convert the natives. He didn't. If he had, he likely wouldn't have invited his Christian-hating father to lead the expedition, and he probably would have brought his priest friend instead of his foster father. Remember what I said about wanderlust? Leif had heard a story about a mystical land from [Bjarni Herjolfsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarni_Herj%C3%B3lfsson), a Norse explorer who, in 986, decided to sail from Iceland to Greenland without a map. He ended up in Vinland, sailing past the coast before eventually making it to Greenland. It was based on these stories that Leif sailed west. \n\nWhy, though? [This](http://i.imgur.com/qzdJqOG.jpg) other source of bad history would make the claim that it was just for exploration's sake, and I'd agree that curiosity undoubtedly had its role to play. However, considering that Leif went to North America and came back with timber and other resources that Greenland would not have had enough of, and that other expeditions were sent out over the course of the next 400 years with the same goals in mind, I'd also argue there was more to it than just wanderlust and curiosity. There was a desire to get resources, find if there was a better place to live, and bring back what knowledge and resources were discovered. And indeed, ten years later, Thorfinn Karlsefni would try and establish a colony in the New World, though it would fail due to hostile natives. \n\nLeif would spend two years in Vinland, returning to Greenland two years later. His brother would then conduct another voyage to gather resources two years after that, and Karlsefni would go five years later to try and establish a more permanent settlement. Over the course of Leif's stay in North America, however, he encountered the Native Americans very infrequently, having two fairly peaceful winters in Vinland. This was in contrast to later expeditions who would have trouble with Skraelings. Considering that Leif didn't interact too terribly much with the Skraelings and that they wouldn't have spoken his language even if he did, it's unlikely that he converted them all to Christianity. There are also no signs of early Christianity in northern Canada, so there's that too. \n\nThe video ends at 2:33 with the narrator saying \"Leif Erikson, a mighty man of God.\" Mighty? Sure, why not. A Christian? Yes, absolutely. Dead set on converting Native Americans to Christianity? Yeah, not really. \n\nSources:\n\n[This](http://www.thehistoryofcanadapodcast.com/tag/greenland/) is a fun podcast, if you can get past the speaker's style\n\n[Here's](http://www.sagatapestry.com/2012/07/skraeling-history-101.html) more information about what Native Americans the Norse would have interacted with.\n\nTotally unrelated, but [here's](http://archive.archaeology.org/online/features/greenland/) a look at why the Greenland colony eventually failed.",

There were problems, such as artificial borders and structural exploitation of the natives, which wouldn't have been solved through just keeping them colonized even longer. The very structure of colonialism -- of being ruled from another continent -- in itself is not very well suited for developing western democratic values. Having your government have as its primary purpose the enrichment of another country, or at least the continued subjugation of it under that other country, is also bad for societal development.\n\nThe fact that colonial borders were often nearly arbitrary was also a problem with colonialism. The post-colonial governments had issues with legitimacy, when there were many different peoples bunched together in their borders, and no natural adherence of them to the nation-state which they had been forced into.\n\nAnyway, trying to keep them for longer usually resulted in bloody wars and instability -- the very opposite of what they're claiming would have happened had we just carried our white man's burden for a bit longer, and educated those silly natives to be proper superior westerners.",

While I've talked about the syphilis aspect of it, it's a good jumping off point for another post about what I think is a much more interesting topic. You see, the pope referred to in the post is Pope Alexander VI, and the amount of bad history surrounding him and his family is amazing. You see another aspect of it [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfpRk9FOFeg) and [here](http://gawker.com/5539334/joust-of-the-whores-the-worst-popes-in-history) and [here](http://www.forbes.com/pictures/efel45eehl/the-vaticans-naughty-bits-rome-italy/). There is all sorts of stuff surrounding Alexander VI, and surrounding his family (the Borgias) more generally. So let's address this. Did Alexander VI die of syphilis? Did he have mass orgies in his Papal apartments? What about the rumours of incest with his daughter, Lucrezia? Was Alexander VI really the worst pope ever? For that matter, what about the Borgias more generally? Let's delve into the depths of Italian papal history. \n\nTo understand why the Borgias have the reputation they do, we need to understand a bit about where they came from and what the objections to them were. The first Borgia pope was [Callixtus III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Callixtus_III), who reigned from 1455-1458. He was a rather pious fellow, but like all the popes of the time, he used his power to advance his family, raising his nephews Juan Luis and Rodrigo to cardinals. Then he died, little remembered, and not terribly successful. I mention him more because of the impact he had on Rodrigo Borja's political aspirations and his ability to fulfil them. In the mid-15th century, the Borjas were a noble family of little importance in Valencia. However, once advanced to Cardinal of Valencia, Rodrigo consolidated his power, creating the Archbishopric of Valencia. When Pope Innocent VIII died in 1492, he was one of the leading candidates for the papacy, despite being a relative outsider when compared to the Italian nobles vying for his position.\n\nIt's in the Conclave of 1492 that we see the first really bad history about Rodrigo Borgia (who (spoiler alert) would become Alexander VI). Rumours abounded that Rodrigo had bribed his way into the Papacy, buying cardinals off with carts full of silver. This action showed the first signs of his depravities and the lengths to which he would go to ensure his own power was secure. The thing is, though, that there's very little evidence for this. Oh, that's not to say there's no evidence, but the evidence for the claim (and for many of the other claims about Alexander VI) tends to come from Johann Bruchard, the Papal Master of Ceremonies from 1483 to 1506. He's not a neutral source. He's not a neutral source at all. We'll come back to him, though. It must also be understood that bribery was not a particularly unique thing for Renaissance popes or for Renaissance clergy. Papal candidates regularly bribed each other with a combination of cash and promises of future political favours in exchange for political support. Considering the Papacy was, at the time, not only a religious office but an important political one, this makes perfect sense. It could be politically extremely advantageous to have a friendly person on the throne, and many lengths were gone to to ensure that would happen. Rodrigo was no real exception to this. While he didn't cart in silver, he likely did make promises of future political power in exchange for support. On 11 August 1492, Rodrigo Borgia was elected to the Papal throne, becoming Alexander VI.\n\nBefore we go much further into Alexander's papal career, one thing must be understood. He liked women. He liked sex. He liked having sex with women and generally having a good time with them. By the time he became pope, Alexander had at least four children, and likely other, unacknowledged children. One mistress that he was especially close to was Vanozza dei Cattanei, who had his four favourite children, Giovanni (or Juan), Cesare, Lucrezia, and Gioffre (or Jofre). He wasn't what we would think of as particularly strict in upholding his vows of celibacy, and the fact that he had children at all is sometimes taken as evidence that he was a pretty terrible pope. Once again, though, he has to be considered in the context of his times. At the Conclave of 1492, for instance, of the 27 papal candidates, only four were actual career priests, the rest being appointed through nepotism or as a political favour to some noble family or another. Vows of celibacy and strict adherence to Church dogma regarding priestly behaviour was not particularly high on their list of interests. Indeed, it was common for popes to have mistresses or illegitimate children, or to engage in sexual proclivities and happy fun times. Pope Pius II, for instance, made a hobby of [writing erotic poetry and comedies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Pius_II#Reputation_and_legacy) (albeit before becoming pope). Pope Julius II [fathered several children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Julius_II#Legacy). Pope Leo X has been [argued to have been gay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Leo_X#Sexuality). Even Alexander's predecessor, Pope Innocent VIII had two illegitimate children (though they were born before he became a priest). In this context, Alexander VI was not terribly unique in his love of women and sex. The fact that he had children would not have been too much of a shock. The same would be the case with his lovers. Some of the bad history around him lies in assuming that he was a terrible pope just because he didn't uphold the vows of celibacy - he wasn't. He lived in an age when that wasn't really the most important part of being pope.\n\nBut what about Alexander VI's career? One famous accusation levelled at Alexander VI is that he hosted orgies and lavish parties in the Papal apartments, complete with hookers and blow and everything a Renaissance Italian could want. The most famous of these is probably the [Banquet of Chestnuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banquet_of_Chestnuts) (or, as the linked articles call it, the \"Jousting of the Whores\"), where Alexander VI was rumoured to have invited fifty prostitutes to grovel over chestnuts like animals while men ran around having sex with them. It's a good story, but the only source for it is our good friend Burchard. Even contemporaries of Alexander VI didn't believe it was the case, and later historical evaluations show that it almost certainly didn't happen. It doesn't fit with what's known about Alexander VI, and it was almost certainly a rumour created to further discredit and malign the Borgia family. \n\nSpeaking of which, let's talk about the Borgias. If ever there is a family whose name equates with debauchery and evil, it's probably the Borgias (and Lucrezia and Cesare most of all). While it's true that they largely weren't the most pleasant people (Cesare was accused of murdering one of his brothers, among other people, for instance), they once again have to be considered in their historical context and bearing in mind exactly how many enemies powerful families could make. Lucrezia's reputation as an incestuous, poisoning whore, for instance, has very little support. Seeing as these rumours about her sprang up at about the same time as the annulment of her marriage to Giovanni Sforza, it seems more likely that Sforza created these rumours about her to drum up support against her. Lucrezia did sleep around and had lovers outside marriage - to the point where there's a possibility that she had a child while her marriage to Sforza was being annulled due to his \"impotence\" - but there's no evidence that her brothers and father numbered among her lovers. Indeed, the fact that Cesare contracted syphilis in his early twenties, but Lucrezia didn't suggests that it's highly unlikely she was sleeping with her brother. Now, all of that said, Lucrezia was shrewd, but she was also a pawn in her family's political game. She was married to three different men, and eventually died after giving birth. I like to think of her like Cersei Lannister - calculating and shrewd, self-interested, but not inherently evil. Except minus the incest. Lucrezia Borgia didn't do incest. \n\nWhat about her brothers, though? Surely their reputations aren't ill-deserved. Once again, we have to look at them in context, Cesare especially. After Alexander VI became pope, he made Giovanni head of the papal armies, granting him a fief and sending him on his merry way to gain more power. At the same time, Cesare was raised to the position of cardinal of Valencia, and Gioffre married Sancha of Aragon, obtaining the Duchy of Alvito in the process. Both Gioffre and Giovanni are largely overshadowed by their brother since he was considered more of a git. Giovanni was murdered in 1497, and immediately, both Gioffre and Cesare were accused, as all three of them had been sleeping with Gioffre's wife, Sancha. Giovanni's body was also found with all his money still in his coinpurse, heavily implying that he hadn't been murdered by thieves. Alexander VI gave Gioffre an official pardon for the murder, but none of this helped either brother's reputation. It's possible that another noble family - such as the Orsinis - had him killed, but it's simply not known who did it. This, in combination with the death of Lucrezia's second husband, fuelled rumours that Cesare was a crazed axe-murderer, killing everybody who disagreed with him or invaded his personal space. The fact that he wore a mask covering half his face near the end of his life almost certainly doesn't help either. \n\nBut what was almost certainly the real clincher for Cesare was the fact that he was set on becoming an Italian prince with his own little swath of territory to rule. With the power of the Papacy backing him and an alliance with King Louis XII of France, Cesare looked like he was in a good position to actually achieve this. He took the cities of Romagna and Marche (where he was viewed as a great improvement over the previous leaders) and Imola and Forli. After the capture of the latter two in 1500, he was named Papal Gonfalonier, which gave him even more prestige and legitimacy. He continued to storm through Italy until the death of Alexander VI in 1503. Despite desperate attempts to gather favour, Cesare's hopes of getting another pope sympathetic to him were stymied by the almost unanimous election of Pope Julius II who really hated the Borgias. He was betrayed and captured in Naples in 1504, escaped to Spain in 1506, and was killed in 1507, having lost all his land and power. While he did have a rather ungraceful tumble from power, Cesare was recognised as a very competent military leader and strategist to the point where even King John III of Navarre wanted to hire him to lead his campaigns. While some of his condotierris feared him, others thought he was a damn fine leader. That said, he's also the model for Machiavelli's Prince, so your mileage may vary on how good a leader he actually was.\n\nIn all seriousness, Cesare Borgia was a man of his time. He was brutal and cruel, but so was everyone else. He wanted power and would do whatever was necessary to achieve it, but that describes all the noble houses of Italy. He might have been crueler or more sadistic than many, but this cruelty was not out of place at the time. It would be now, absolutely, but as always, these things must be considered within their historical context. \n\nLet's go back to Pope Alexander VI, though. As I mentioned earlier, he died in 1503 under circumstances that would lead our good buddy Johann Burchard to describe \"the appearance of the face then was far more horrifying than anything that had ever been seen or reported before.\" This is the syphilis to which my linked post is referring. There were rumours that the pope had died of syphilis contracted after sleeping with Lucrezia or any number of other women.  Other rumours stated that Cesare had poisoned the pope (Burchard, while he doesn't say this explicitly, disparages Cesare enough in his description of Alexander's death to make me suspect that he might hold this view). Most likely, however, Alexander died as part of the malaria epidemic that had been sweeping through Rome, and which Cesare was afflicted with as well. While it's once again one of those things that can't be known for sure, there is no evidence that Alexander had syphilis, and it's very difficult to think of a reason why Cesare might poison Alexander. \n\nAfter Alexander's death, Pope Julius II had the Borgia apartments sealed, declaring that Alexander \"desecrated the Holy Church as none before. He usurped the papal power by the devil's aid, and I forbid under the pain of excommunication anyone to speak or think of Borgia again. His name and memory must be forgotten. It must be crossed out of every document and memorial. His reign must be obliterated. All paintings made of the Borgias or for them must be covered over with black crepe. All the tombs of the Borgias must be opened and their bodies sent back to where they belong – to Spain.\" He wasn't a fan of the Borgias. While Alexander remained maligned over the next decades, later popes such as Sixtus V and Urban VIII declared him to be an excellent pope. This is partly due to his attempts to reform aspects of the Church, including moral codes and property ownerships. He was also a massive patron of the arts, funding artists such as Michelangelo and Raphael. All in all, his was not a half-bad papacy, and a great deal did get accomplished.\n\nWhy, then, is Alexander VI seen as one of the worst popes of all time? Why is there all this hatred for the Borgias? One theory which is proposed in [this article](http://www.historytoday.com/blog/2013/10/were-borgias-really-so-bad) is that the Borgias were seen as the worst of the worst not because they were particularly terrible by Renaissance Italian standards, but rather because they were Spaniards playing an Italian political game. The Papacy was a route to political power and wealth on the Italian peninsula. With all the other families and groups vying for this power, the introduction of yet another party - and a powerful one at that - was not good. The reaction to the Borgias was partly based on this sentiment that Spaniards did not need to be gaining power in Italy, and definitely didn't need to get Italian land.\n\nAnother factor that undoubtedly plays a huge role is Julius II's reaction to the Borgias and cries for them to be completely erased from history. While I know it's a joke on this sub, in this instance, because the Borgias had fallen so thoroughly, what was remembered about them was filtered through the leading Italian families, all of whom had hated the Borgias for one reason or another. Quite simply, Victor struck again and decided that the Borgias shouldn't be part of happy history. \n\nThe final factor is probably Johann Burchard and his journals. The position of Papal Master of Ceremonies was not without its prestige, and his journals and records do provide a thorough look at numerous popes' rules, Alexander VI among them. What this means is that much of the information we have about Alexander VI's life and routine is filtered through an unreliable narrator who saw it as being in his interest to malign the pope. When the records are biased, it's difficult to filter out the truth, and Alexander VI and the Borgias are a perfect example of this. Were the Borgias terrible people? Probably no more so than any other Renaissance family hellbent on power and prestige. The difference with the Borgias, though, is that they had the misfortune to leave the telling of their history to their enemies. \n\nSources:\n\n[This and only this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDDCQc3m_1U)\n\n[Okay, maybe a little primary sourcing as well](http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/alexanderVI.htm)",

For one thing, he believes that King Edward VIII was a time-traveling Nazi. In a thread about measuring the size of the Earth, Drooper claims the following:\n\n&gt;According to the Smithsonian Institute, artifacts and DNA samples, the Basques from Spain and France successfully navigated to the East Coast of North America (several thousands of years earlier than Siberian groups entering the continent from the west). That's why the oldest settlements were on the East Coast--a thing that always baffled archaeologists.\n\nHoly shit. Drooper managed to read [this article](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-basques-were-here-43953489/?no-ist) and conclude that the Basque settlements in North America **from the 17th and 18th centuries Anno Domini** are actually the remnants of Basques who traveled backward in time over ten thousand years to before Basques even existed. I don't think there are words to describe how insane this is. \n\nAlso, the oldest traces of human habitation in the Americas are not on the East Coast. There are sites in the ~13000 year old range in the [Yucatan](http://www.northwestern.edu/newscenter/stories/2014/05/stunning-discovery-one-of-oldest-human-skeletons-in-north-america.html), [Texas](http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/03/24/texas-sheds-light-americas-settlers/), and California's [Channel Islands](http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0779260.html).\n\n&gt;Cooler still are Phoenician relics and writings on the coast of the Americas.\n\nThey'd be pretty cool if they existed, yeah. But they don't, so no dice.\n\n&gt;Artifacts like this one--of a bearded man with European features--found in a Mexican grave from the pre-Colombian period lend credence to this cross-oceanic communication: http://davidpratt.info/americas/amer5-19b.jpg\n\nCheck it guys--facial hair proves that white people were there! How else could Mesoamericans come up with the idea of hair being on the face?\n\nFor the record, the idea that you can determine the origin of the facial features of a carving like that is quite erroneous. It winds up being people seeing what they want to see.\n\n&gt;...as well as cocaine found in the bodies of Egyptian mummies (when the cacao plant was only in the New World). Source: http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~legneref/ethnic/mummy.htm\n\nOh for the love of fuck, not this again. He's mixing up coca and cacao, but anyone who can't think of a way that cocaine got onto mummies in a museum lacks imagination. Incidentally, nobody's been able to reproduce the detection of coca on the mummies. Also, they come from a wide variety of sites but they were all in a single museum's collection. Strange how the relevant variable seems to be where they spent their time after being unearthed, rather than what their origin was. If there were a Transatlantic trade during the 1000 BC-400 AD period that these mummies came from, it would be all the fuck over every piece of history written in the Roman or Hellenistic world. Add to this the fact that coca was not actually found in the mummies, it was coca *metabolites*. \n\nBesides, how the fuck are you going to maintain a transatlantic trade? The trade winds only blow eastward once you get pretty far up into the North Atlantic, and there's simply no evidence that Egyptians or Phoenicians or whoever were engaged in a large-scale trade empire across the Atlantic. In fact there's a lot of evidence that they weren't, such as the fact that none of them had oceangoing boats of any kind.",

        "text": "You know what's pretty cool? Syphilis. Well, maybe not \"cool,\" per se, but interesting. For instance, did you know that this [comment](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2ips4q/historians_of_reddit_what_are_some_r_rated_facts/cl4c0gz) saying that syphilis is definitely an import from the New World isn't entirely accurate? It's a commonly held belief that syphilis was an import from the New World, but it's actually heavily debated. To understand the controversy, let's hop in our time machine and explore.\n\nIn 1495, French troops and Spanish mercenaries were capturing the city of Naples as part of the First Italian War. The capture itself had been relatively easy. However, they had brought something with them. As troops occupied the city, an epidemic broke out of a disease that caused massive purple flower-like lesions, rashes, and sloughing of the skin. People died rapidly and in agony. By 1496, it had been definitively labelled as a new disease (though its name would vary from place to place as everyone laid blame on someone else for it) by Joseph Grünpeck, and in 1530, it was first called \"syphilis\" by Girolamo Fracastoro, a physician and poet. It tore its way across Europe before mutating into the sexually transmitted version that we all know and love. \n\nThe fact that the first recorded eruption of syphilis was in 1494/1495 is interesting and suggestive. Many have used it as evidence that syphilis was brought in from the New World and the Spanish explorations there. Indeed, the version of syphilis that the soldiers suffered in Naples wasn't terribly different from the version described and suffered by Native Americans - a virulent, horrible disease that killed quickly and was transmitted via touch. It would seem likely that there is a connection. However, it must always be kept in mind when studying something like this that correlation doesn't necessarily equal causation. There are several theories about the origin of syphilis, only one of which is that it was brought to Europe by the Spanish.\n\nTo understand why there is controversy, we need to look at some outbreaks and epidemics that have been described as being syphilitic in nature. There are many, and there are many skeletons that have been examined and found to have similar problems as are seen in skeletons that definitely had syphilis. One of the most compelling cases of pre-Columbian syphilis comes from a 13th century English priory (as written about in [this](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224497409550828#.VDZPM_mSxrM) journal article and on [this](http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/8129) web page). In the case of the English priory, some skeletons that had been described as having leprosy show bone lesions that are characteristic of syphilis (though they're not exclusive to syphilis, and it's impossible to tell from a skeleton alone what exactly caused bone lesions). Indeed, this distinction between leprosy and syphilis lies at the heart of the controversy over the source of syphilis. Other scientists have pointed out that similar symptoms to syphilis have been recorded in Chinese and Roman history, long before contact with the New World, and possibly suggesting that syphilis existed in some form in pre-Columbian Europe. \n\nMore evidence that syphilis might have existed in Europe prior to 1492 comes from articles like [these](http://archive.archaeology.org/9701/newsbriefs/syphilis.html) that describe how some forms of \"leprosy\" were treated. Some of the forms of the disease were treated with mercury, quite a different treatment than ordinary leprosy, and a traditional treatment for syphilis. Once again, though, correlation does not equal causation, and just because the same treatment was used for both doesn't mean they were the same. This is especially true depending on how the treatment worked. If it worked by treating lesions, then it's more than understandable that it would have been used on leprosy as well.\n\nHowever, there are further difficulties for the theory of a pre-Columbian existence for syphilis in the form of a study done in 2011. This study evaluated the skeletons used in previous studies and tested them for syphilis, [finding no evidence that the lesions were unquestionably syphilitic](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/case-closed-columbus/). That doesn't rule out that they *could have been syphilitic*, but it can't be conclusively stated that they absolutely were. There are a myriad of bone lesion-causing things in the world. It's possible that these other things could have caused it. That said, the study is not without its problems, and it's certainly caused controversy by saying that there's no evidence of pre-Columbian European syphilis.\n\nAnother interesting twist in the puzzle comes from [yaws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaws) and [bejel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonvenereal_endemic_syphilis), two diseases endemic to the Old World, but both of which strongly resemble syphilis. Both cause skin lesions and disfigurement, and both can cause death if left untreated. It's been demonstrated that syphilis is related to yaws and bejel as well, suggesting a common ancestor for them. Both were undoubtedly present, and both - while not as violent as syphilis - were causing trouble. Both also could have been confused for leprosy. \n\nSo where does this leave syphilis? As I said, there is some controversy, and skeletons, while they don't lie, do leave a lot to interpretation and imagination. It's entirely possible - and indeed probable - that syphilis comes from the New World. It's definitely likely that the particular violent brand suffered by French soldiers at Naples in 1495 did come from the New World. However, it's bad history to declare the question so thoroughly finished. Cases like the 13th century priory do raise questions about the origins of syphilis, and whether some milder form of syphilis did exist in the Old World prior to contact with the New World. Evidence will tell, I'm sure, but currently the evidence isn't there. \n\nOh, and the question of whether or not Pope Alexander VI died of syphilis? That's definitely bad history, but that's another post entirely (oooo, cliffhanger!).\n\nSources ('cause everybody loves sources):\n[A summary of the article claiming there was no pre-Columbian European syphilis](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/case-closed-columbus/)\n\n[A different article disagreeing with that one](http://www.livescience.com/40885-syphilis-origin-mystery.html)\n\n[This one is about Columbus myths more generally.](http://www.livescience.com/16468-christopher-columbus-myths-flat-earth-discovered-americas.html)\n\n[This one agrees with the first one.](http://www.livescience.com/2217-columbus-brought-syphilis-europe.html)\n\n[This one just hates everyone.](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224497409550828#.VDZPM_mSxrM)\n\n[And the Wikipedia article, just for good measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_syphilis)",

While I'm thrilled that more interest is being shown in the Revolutionary War by popular media, the trailer for this particular show leaves me shaking my head and muttering \"What did I do to deserve this?\"\n\nTo be fair, I didn't have high expectations for AMC's *Turn* (based off the previews), and while the historicity of *Turn* is laughable, I still mostly enjoyed it because of the actors and the characters. \n\nHaving said that, the preview for *Sons of Liberty* leaves me even less hope than the preview for *Turn* did. Even though the clip is only 29 seconds long, nearly every second has bad history going on. \n\n**Clothing**\n\nApparently only the British know what colors are. At least the British uniforms aren't all bog standard redcoat unis. However none of the colonists seem to have any decent clothing, and all of it is grays and browns.

Likely his suit would have also been green, or it would be a complementary color. Oh, and if there's ever a movie about Paul Revere, Jack Black would be a near perfect match. [See?](http://i.imgur.com/gVe5jI8.jpg)\n\n[John Adams](http://blog.chicagohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/chm-adamscoat.jpg). Now granted, that suit was worn by John Adams to his inauguration in 1797, but keep in mind that fashion trends for men's suits in the late 18th century had been trending towards the more conservative. Yet here Adams is wearing a red velvet suit to his inauguration. [Another](http://i.imgur.com/3xJZLu9.jpg) John Adams portrait from sometime after the Revolution (but before his inauguration). The painting makes it hard to determine if it's green velvet or black velvet that he's wearing, but there's a distinct lack of browns and grays and rough material. \n\n[Samuel Adams](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/J_S_Copley_-_Samuel_Adams.jpg). This portrait was done by John Singleton Copley around 1772. Note the complete absence of any browns and grays or any other drab and rough material. \n\n\n**The Nicknames**\n\n***Samuel Adams “The Instigator”***\n\nNo, not really. HBO’s John Adams certainly portrayed him that way, but he really wasn't a demagogue. He was the one writing to his political connections in Massachusetts in 1775 and telling them to tone down their rhetoric of independence. He's been portrayed in the historiography as being the main mover and shaker in Boston, but he really wasn't.\n\nOh and where did Samuel Adams, the notorious instigator, get new recruits for the Sons of Liberty? [At choir practice](http://allthingsliberty.com/2014/02/you-wont-believe-how-samuel-adams-recruited-sons-of-liberty/)\n\n***John Hancock “The Spoiled Son”***\n\nYes, Hancock did inherit considerable wealth from his family. However he spent it much of it to garner political influence. Not exactly the mark of a spoiled son. Also, Hancock was born in 1737. That means he would have been 33 at the time of the Boston Massacre, 38 at the time of Lexington &amp; Concord, and 39 when the Declaration of Independence was signed. Also there’s no indication at all that he was spoiled. Oh and his father actually died when Hancock was 7. He was raised by his uncle and aunt, and his uncle died in 1764 (Hancok had actually started to run the family businesses as early as 1761, fully taking over in 1763). \n\n***Paul Revere “The Thug”*** \n\nNo idea at all what the basis for this nickname is. Maybe because Revere was a shop owner? He did organize and participate in a society of \"mechaniks\" (aka artisans and shop keepers) who kept an eye on British movements and reported them to Dr. Joseph Warren. He also worked for the Continental Congress as a courier, going on several long journeys for them before his ride on April 18th, 1775. \n\nOh and there’s the classic badhistory line “The British are coming!” as he gallops madly through the streets, a scene which never happened. 1.) Had he been yelling at the top of his lungs as he went through the sleepy towns it would have been \"The Regulars are coming!\", or \"The troops are coming!\". 2.) He didn't actually go galloping madly through the streets. He actually took the time to knock on individual doors to wake up the people on his route. Those individuals then spread the alarm further out via runners, bonfires, bells, musket shots, etc. \n\n***John Adams “The Reluctant Revolutionary”.*** \n\nNo, not really. He was just as fervent in his desire for independence as was his cousin Samuel Adams. After all, it was John Adams who called the destruction of the tea a “most magnificent Movement” and “an Epocha in history”, and then went on to suggest that maybe a few bodies floating in the harbor would do more than the destruction of property:\n\n“This however is but an Attack upon Property. Another similar Exertion of popular Power, may produce the destruction of Lives. Many Persons wish, that as many dead Carcasses were floating in the Harbour, as there are Chests of Tea:—a much less Number of Lives however would remove the Causes of all our Calamities.”\n\nAdams was fully invested in the Whig cause from very early on. \n\n**Miscellaneous Nonsense**\n\nSince when did Paul Revere have a long knife scar on his cheek? (at :18 seconds). And him a young man? He was born in 1734. \n\nSamuel Adams is being portrayed by a young man, who *might* be in his early thirties. Samuel Adams was born in 1722--you do the math as to how old he should be.\n\nJohn Hancock is being portrayed by an actor who looks like he's in his early to mid twenties. Hancock was born in 1737 and would have been 38 in 1775. \n\nIt's hard to tell how old the actor is who's playing John Adams, but Adams was born in 1735.  \n\nOh look, it's the stereotypical murderous redcoat. \"I want the scalp of every colonial savage\". Really? Really? \n\nAlso I don't recall any brawls or fighting taking place in Revere's shop or home (early on we see what looks like a brawl in his home). \n\nOh and Revere didn't actually fight in the war--not in the manner that we see based on the 29 second preview. He went on one expedition as an artillery commander, did basically nothing during that expedition, and was later brought up on charges of cowardice and dereliction of duty. He got off without any major scandal, but mostly because the entire expedition was such a huge scandal and embarrassment to Massachusetts (who had funded it and led it), that they just wanted to sweep it all under the rug. \n\nWhy is everything so grungy and dirty? It's like the stereotypical medieval Hollywood cliche. I'm willing to bet that any shots of the show that are set in a Loyalist home or a British officer's home will show nice, beautiful homes, in contrast to the poor living conditions of all those oppressed people. Never mind that Revere, Hancock, and the two Adams were all doing pretty well, financially speaking. \n\n**Edit:**\n\nOh yeah, one other thing. There's a bit there where someone is arguing passionately for resistance to the British and says something like \"Our children are lying dead in the streets!\". There are two possible things this could be referring to. The first is the time when a mob gathered outside a customs inspector's home. The custom inspector fired on the crowd, hitting a [12 year old boy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Seider) in the chest and arm. The boy would later die. Samuel Adams would organize a funeral for him (as he did for those killed in the Boston Massacre) and 2,000 people attended. However, given the relative obscurity of this event, I'm rather doubtful that this is the incident being spoken of. \n\nInstead this is probably referring to the Boston Massacre. Only there weren't any \"children\" that were killed in that incident. Two of those killed were 17 when they died. One of those seventeen-year-olds was working as a mate on a ship. In other words he was on his own and acting like (and being given the responsibility of) a man. Another of the 17 year olds was an apprentice who would also have been working full time, though not on his own. \n\nIn an age where colonial militias compromised all males between the ages of 16 and 50 (60 in some colonies), a 17 year old would not be considered a child. Both the British and the American armies would sign teenagers. In fact Joseph Plumb Martin (who wrote a memoir of his time as an enlisted man) wanted to join up when he was 15. He was prevented, not because of his age, but because his grandparents (who were raising him) simply didn't want him to go to war at all. He threatened to run away and become a privateer unless they allowed it and they finally consented in 1776. There are records of kids as young as 13 fighting in the ranks. In that sort of world, a 17 year old would not have been considered a child. \n\nIt kind of seems like *Sons of Liberty* is taking all of it's characterization from HBO's *John Adams*. ",

        "text": "Historical figures and their political, racial, or gender views have long been a subject of debate. What do you do with people like Socrates, for instance, who argue that women are less than men? What about Ezra Pound, with his Fascist writing that is still fantastic and a valuable part of the literary canon? Can Leni Riefenstahl's \"Triumph of the Will\" still be admired as a documentary despite the fact that it's a love letter to Hitler? None of it is clear, and philosophers have been debating it for as long as there have been debates. \n\nI bring this up because I came across [this comment](http://np.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2hpc2x/mexican_man_decides_to_give_the_us_life_a_try/ckur7ks) on TheRedPill, Reddit's misogyny lair. It makes the claim that:\n\n&gt; Once you get past the language, you can realize how deeply into TRP Shakespeare was.\n\nWhich is interesting. See, the thing about it isn't that Shakespeare can be misogynistic at times - the play that this commenter cites, \"The Taming of the Shrew,\" can be interpreted as being incredibly misogynistic. Rather, the interesting questions are about whether Shakespeare could have subscribed to a philosophical view that didn't exist during his time (hint: probably not), whether Shakespeare was actually misogynistic in his plays, and what is an acceptable interpretation of Shakespeare and what is not. \n\nI think it's important to start by saying that, much like one can read the Bible through a queer lens or read Gilgamesh through a feminist lens, it's entirely possible to read Shakespeare through a Red Pill lens. I'm not here to say that it's wrong to interpret literature in a certain way. If there is support for a given reading - and in the case of \"The Taming of the Shrew,\" at least, I can certainly see the support - then I'm not going to sit here and say it's an invalid reading because I disagree with it. That's not how literary interpretations work. What I will take issue with is the assertion that Shakespeare was a Red Piller. This isn't historically accurate.\n\nBut I'm getting ahead of myself. It might be useful to start off by defining what the Red Pill actually is. I call it a den of misogyny and scum unlike any you will ever encounter anywhere else on the internet, but I'm a bit biased. [This](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-red-pill-reddit-2013-8) is a bit of a less angry look at the Red Pill and what it's trying to accomplish. In essence, it's a bunch of guys set on the idea that women are inferior to them, or that feminism has taken women out of their natural role (caring for men and children) and ruined the world. [I'm not exaggerating](http://illimitablemen.com/understanding-the-red-pill/red-pill-constitution/). It's the sort of viewpoint that looks outmoded even by 1950s standards. \n\nBut this isn't meant to be a critique of the Red Pill (though I apologise, I can't help myself). Rather, it's meant to look at whether Shakespeare was a Red Piller. As the article makes clear, the Red Pill as a philosophy was founded in the early 2010s (though it does have roots in much older misogynistic thought, as you probably noticed). It started on the internet as an outcropping of the pick-up artists movements that sought to rearrange gender relations to take away what was perceived of as too much power on the part of women in sexual relations. \n\nShakespeare was dead by the 2010s. Shakespeare died in 1616, and so it's unlikely he read the Red Pill Constitution or subscribed to TRP. This doesn't mean, though, that he couldn't have held some Red Pill ideas or ideas that would be recognisable as a form of the Red Pill to its modern subscribers. To be clear, though, Shakespeare himself could not have been a Red Piller, much like Aristotle could not have been a communist, regardless of how many of the ideas they held in common. If a particular branch of thought does not exist while you are living, it's rather difficult to subscribe to it. Asserting that historical figures were Communists or Fascists or Red Pillers before such terms or theories or schools of thought existed is itself bad history. It's presentism, and that's a no-no.\n\nBut there's still the question of whether Shakespeare can be claimed as a proto-Red Piller, and honestly, this is the more interesting question. What must be kept in mind, though, is historical context. Part of what makes the Red Pill as a movement so bizarre (at least to me) is that it is hyper-conservative even within the context of sexism. It's taking a stance that goes beyond what is expected for a particular line of thought. An equivalent might be a 21st century woman who thinks that showing her ankles is sinful, or a vegan who won't eat anything that casts a shadow. They're things that we look at as ridiculous, even if we accept at least some of the underlying premises. As a Shakespearean example, I might point to [The Arraignment of Lewd, Idle, Froward, and Unconstant Women](http://digital.library.lse.ac.uk/objects/lse:sim568qag) by Joseph Swetnam, written in 1615. It's something that goes beyond the norm in terms of the standards it's trying to set to the point of near insanity. \n\nSo what about Shakespeare? Well, Shakespeare is an interesting case. He lived in a time that, historically, was not the best in terms of women's rights, and his characters aren't always the most progressive. In general, the women in Shakespeare's plays tend to be confined by their gender into the roles of wife, mother, or love interest. Even the characters that are more traditionally thought of as stronger female characters - like Hermia from \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" - are still acting within the norms set by their gender. Hermia, for instance, is still defined by her love for Lysander, and the consequences she faces are consequences based on the fact that she loves and must marry. However, if it were the case that Shakespeare were espousing Red Pill-esque philosophy in his plays, we might expect to see some sort of consequences or admonition for the fact that Hermia was defying her father to love Lysander. Instead, what we find is that, in the end, Hermia and Lysander end up together, meaning there is no punishment for her dissension from patriarchy. Rather, there is reward for her disobedience in the form of being able to stay with Lysander. \n\nEven in some of the plays that the linked thread is citing, there are women defying the Red Pill narrative of what a woman is. In \"Macbeth,\" while Lady Macbeth is conniving and shrewd, this plays as much a role in Macbeth's rise to power as it does his fall. He is able to succeed as much as he does because of Lady Macbeth's help. \n\nBut then there's \"The Taming of the Shrew.\" For those who are unfamiliar with it, \"The Taming of the Shrew\" is about a man named Petruchio and his courtship of Katherina, a hot-headed woman who is described as being so miserable that no man would ever want to marry her. Petruchio marries her and \"tames\" her, essentially putting her through an abusive relationship where she is denied food and clothing, belittled, and abused until, in the end, she is good wife material, obeying Petruchio and giving a speech about how wives should obey their husbands. It is exactly the sort of thing the Red Pill would love. \n\nThe thing is, though, that \"The Taming of the Shrew\" is a bit unlike other things that Shakespeare has written, at least with regards to its depiction of women. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that Shakespeare didn't write the thing. What I'm saying is that it can't really be held to be representative of the Shakespearean canon. Even in Elizabethan times when it was first performed, audiences were taken aback by it. We see evidence of this through plays that were written in response, such as [The Tamer Tamed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Woman%27s_Prize). Indeed, in many performances since, performers have done what they can to try and soften the taming, ranging from playing up the farcical nature of it to having Katherina wink knowingly during the ending monologue. What all of this suggests - and what looking at \"The Taming of the Shrew\" in the greater context of Shakespeare's other plays and female characters - is that, rather than being meant literally, it is perhaps the case that \"The Taming of the Shrew\" was meant as a farce and as an example of what not to do. Petruchio is never portrayed as a particularly good character or even someone to emulate, raising the question of whether or not the audience is even meant to sympathise with him in the first place. Certainly the reactions of the time - or what we know of them - suggest that he wasn't a good character and wasn't someone the audiences were happy or comfortable with. \n\nAll of this comes back to the question - was Shakespeare deep into the Red Pill? Well, as I've already stated, on a historical level, no. He couldn't have been. The Red Pill is well after Shakespeare, and ascribing modern beliefs to him isn't how history works. On a literary level, it's entirely possible to read Shakespeare through a Red Pill lens, just as it's possible to read his work through a feminist or queer lens. The work says what you ask it to say, and none of that reflects Shakespeare's personal beliefs. What it reflects is what you're looking for in it. Indeed, I'd argue that the presence of stronger female characters than expected is indicative of the fact that Shakespeare probably wasn't a Red Piller. His personal life as well suggests that he probably didn't subscribe to anything more sexist than the society he was in. ",

        "text": "Okay, I'm sure, knowing Cracked's track-record, that there's plenty of other, more egregious bits of badhistory in this article, but I'm only a poor freshman and still haven't learned enough to refute most historical BS, so I sorta geeked out when I saw something I knew was wrong. \"YES!\" I cried. \"I can finally make a submission to /r/badhistory! and make history!\" Just a warning, this might also be related to badtheology, but it is historical in nature too, so I figured it still fit.\n... ahem...\nThat said, in their article [\"5 Historical Figured Who Died the Weirdest Deaths\"](http://www.cracked.com/article_16133_the-5-historical-figures-who-died-weirdest-deaths.html) in the entry on Arius, they stated that \"Arius was one of the most prominent heretics of early Christianity. Most modern historians will tell you that all of humanity was pretty much batshit insane right up to some point in the early 20th century, so you can imagine how bad it must have been back then. That's why Arius was labeled a 'heretic' for humbly suggesting that there might have been a time when Christ hadn't existed. Like, say, before he was born. HERESY!\"\n\nThis is the only part I know enough about to have a problem with. \nI'm going to completely ignore the \"bat-shit insane\" nonsense that \"most modern historians\" would absolutely NOT agree with. Because they would agree we're still totally insane today. That's not why I made this, though it is a little nugget of badhistory in its own right.\n\nBasically, that's not what Arianism was really about, and not why his teaching was condemned as heretical. Also, there's a certain implication that seems to be made that I want to try to address too.\n\nAnyway, it's a dramatic over-generalization to say that he was condemned for teaching that there was a time before Jesus existed. Especially, \"... say, before he was born!\" Theologically, this fails to understand that Jesus was taught to be \"God the Son\" or \"the Word\"'s human form. No one ever believed that Jesus specifically existed before he was born. That's silly. (John 1:1,14)\n\nHowever, Arius believed that \"the Word\" was a being created before the world began that was subordinate to God the Father, and that the Holy Spirit was a created being subordinate to the Word, neither of whom was God, merely perfect created beings. (\"A Concise History of Christian Thought\" Tony Lane, 29)\n\nSo there are already two problems. One: Christian's believed that the Word/God the Son existed as Jesus before his birth. Two: A misunderstanding of what Arius taught, which was not merely that Jesus didn't exist before his birth, but that the Word was a created being and therefore not God. He taught that Jesus couldn't be God because he was created. That's a bit more fundamental to Christian theology.\n\nMeaning there's a third problem: Their implication is that the early church was ridiculous for condemning him as heretical, but it turns out that he was challenging something incredibly necessary to Christianity. If you believe Jesus isn't God, you can't really be called a Christian, that's just logical.\n\nFinally, they seem to imply that being condemned as heretical was worse than it was. Yes, in time the church grew in power so that heretics where burned or imprisoned or exiled, but at that time, Christianity was brand new and still persecuted when Arius was around ([250-336 AD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arius); the [Edict of Milan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Milan) that allowed tolerance of Christianity was issued in 313, so he spent most of his life in persecuted Christianity), so all the church had power to do to him was basically say, \"This guy ain't right.\" and not allow him to continue teaching as a bishop... which I personally feel is pretty reasonable considering he was teaching something fundamentally different than what Christianity was.\n\nAnyway, this is just another case of Cracked ditching nuance and accuracy for a throw-away joke, but since I knew enough to correct it, and as a Christian myself am somewhat bothered by it's implication that Christians were always intolerant petty ass-holes (not that we often AREN'T, but in this case we really weren't), I figured I'd take a shot at this whole thing. \n\nPlease, by all means give me critiques and suggestions. I'm totally new at this, and in time, if I'm able, I'd like to be able to contribute more often. Especially with sourcing my claims. It's weird working in this Reddit format. Plus I'm an English major, so I'm used to MLA and despise Turabian anyway, which I know is favored in historical circles. I don't even know if you CAN do footnotes or hyperscript... whatever.\n\nAnyway, comments appreciated, and I hope y'all found it interesting and I didn't screw up nothing myself.\n\n\n\n\n",

Tell me more.\n\nI suppose that is why ancient Egypt (which relied on annual flooding of the Nile and complex irrigation in order to grow food) was such a long-lasting and successful society. And why domestication of animals and agriculture in the Old World developed in the Fertile Crescent rather than in Europe. And why agriculture was independently developed in Central America. In fact, Europe never developed agriculture independently at all, but adopted it as it spread from the Middle East.\n\n&gt; Europe also inherited a culture that encouraged study and experimentation from the ancient Greeks, which is why we have science today.\n\nHmm. Well.\n\n1. This is hardly unique to Europe. The Arab world saved much ancient Greek writing after the collapse of the Roman empire, and much Arabic science from Islam's Golden Age was based off this. Indeed, the reason we have so much classical writing surviving can be attributed at least partially to Arabic scholars saving what was lost to Europe.\n\n2. While the idea of a European dark age is somewhat misleading, it is true to say that the renaissance, and the rise of Christian Humanism, was the point at which scholarship on the Greek model in Europe underwent a massive revival. Prior to that, most intellectual activity in the western world was undertaken by the church, and was neither what we would call science today, nor particularly its forerunner.\n\n3. Greek 'natural philosophy' (the word science itself was a later coinage) was not especially like what we would call science today. Roger Bacon is generally considered the father of the modern scientific method, but it wasn't until the 17th century that it was really widely adopted by the likes of Newton, Hooke, and so on in England (and across Western Europe, but I'm less familiar with the key figures outside of England itself). \n\n&gt; China and India stagnated for centuries. In China at least this was due to government fiat, where a short-sighted emperor recalled their exploration fleets and burned them. China would have only sporadic contact with the west from then until the 19th century, when steamships made trade with Asia more reasonable.\n\nI'm not familiar with the story of the exploration fleets, but I'm not a Chinese historian. It might be true, I have no idea, but the vagueness of the story doesn't exactly imbue me with confidence. \n\nWhat I can say about this, though, is that China expressly did not 'stagnate for centuries'. Such important innovations in the modern world as gunpowder, the compass, papermaking, and printing, were invented in China before in Europe (and, indeed, both gunpowder and paper making, at least, weren't invented in Europe at all, but spread through Asia and the middle east before being adopted there).\n\n&gt; North Africa and the Middle East fell into a Muslim dark age as Europe was hitting the Renaissance and never really recovered from that.\n\nI've never heard of an Islamic dark age, but this sounds like a massively simplistic explanation for the decline of the Arabic world as an important power. Especially considering that as late as 1683 the Ottoman empire was *fucking besieging fucking Vienna*, and that in 1914 it was still considered a Great Power.\n\nEDIT: Okay, still a Great Power is, as at least two people have pointed out, somewhat overstating the case. By 1914 the Ottoman empire was considered the 'sick man of Europe', and the Eastern Question (what to do about the decline of the Ottoman Empire, i.e. who gets which bit, and what happens if Russia makes huge gains here) had been around since the end of the Russo-Turkish war in 1774. That said, the idea that the Islamic world entered a dark age from which it never recovered in the 15th century is clearly laughable.\n\n&gt; The indigenous societies in the Americas were missing some pretty basic technologies like steel working and the wheel, which hobbled their development. \n\nThis has been covered so many times in badhistory, but just for fuck's sake. [The wheel had been fucking invented in the New World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel#mediaviewer/File:Remojadas_Wheeled_Figurine.jpg), it just wasn't used because it's much less practical on fucking mountains and in fucking rainforests. (Yes, I'm massively simplifying central and south american geography. Deal with it.) Additionally, assuming that because x technology wasn't known in y civilisation, then y civilisation was inherently inferior to z civilisation in which it was, without any argument backing it up is pretty fucking awful argumentation.\n\nAnd, as a bonus, some bad fucking gender history:\n\n&gt; Up until the 20th century and the advent of reliable birth control, most women's adult lives revolved around pregnancy and child care. There were outliers over the centuries, like Hatshepsut, Joan of Arc, Ada Lovelace, and Grace Hopper, but the sheer number of women who that did describe kept women as a whole from contributing anywhere near as much.\n\nThis is true, but this doesn't explain why this is so. I'll come back to this bit later when I have more time, but for now you have to take my word for it that this is a fairly silly argument.\n\nEDIT: [cordis_melum on this](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2ig3fx/the_reason_for_white_privilege_is_not_hurr_racism/cl1va7i); [me on this in Ancient Athens](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2ig3fx/the_reason_for_white_privilege_is_not_hurr_racism/cl1xxw9)\n",

        "text": "[This image](http://i.imgur.com/YUTgJVe.jpg) popped up on my Facebook feed recently and I was shocked - shocked, I tells ya! - when I saw it! Look at the thing! It's so blatantly bad history that I'm surprised the person who made it hasn't already died of a shame heart attack. \n\nI think it's obvious what's wrong about it, but rule 4 says I have to explain, so off I go. \n\nThe character on the left (the rail gun) is [Schwerer Gustav](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwerer_Gustav). Schwerer Gustav was developed in the 1930s as a solution to the problem of the Maginot Line. It was large enough that it could destroy the fortresses, then trundle off like it was nothing. It weighed 1350 tonnes, had a 32.5 metre long gun, and could fire shells up to 29 miles. Gustav was a beast. Unfortunately, it was so much of a beast that it wasn't finished by the time the Nazis invaded France, and instead had to sit there and watch a Blitzkrieg be more effective anyway. Tragic. Gustav was eventually completed in 1942 and sent to the Siege of Sevastopol, where, after firing 48 rounds, it wore out its barrel and needed a new one. It then went and sat outside Leningrad until it was destroyed in 1945 to prevent its capture. Needless to say, Gustav didn't survive the war. \n\nThe first part of the picture's bad history can be found here. In the image, Gustav is excited about providing support to the Western Front, but as [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Front_(World_War_II)) makes clear, Gustav never went anywhere near the Western Front. Gustav went to the Eastern Front where it provided support to the artillery and sieges there. For shame, picture maker, for not knowing where Gustav went and why!\n\nThere is another aspect to the picture, though, one which is less nitpicky and more egregious. The character on the right is [Thomas the Tank Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_the_Tank_Engine), children's icon and plucky locomotive extraordinaire. Besides being too big compared to Gustav (I'll forgive that as a trick of perspective), there's something more wrong with Thomas' presence in this picture, asking Gustav about WWII. You see, [*The Railway Series*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Railway_Series), the series of books in which Thomas first appeared, wasn't published until 1946, a year after Gustav was destroyed. Thomas as a character couldn't have had a conversation with Gustav - Gustav was dead long before Thomas existed.\n\nNow granted, there is a case that could be made that Thomas and Gustav could have had a conversation. The character was conceived of before 1946, certainly, and its possible that this conception could have had a conversation with Gustav. The first train story - and the one that the author, Rev. Awdry, credits with the creation of *The Railway Series* - was written in 1942, when Gustav was still in existence. However, this story feature an engine named Edward, and thus couldn't have been a story with Thomas as a character. Indeed, Thomas as a character didn't exist until late 1942, when Rev. Awdry presented his son with a carved train called Thomas. At this point, Gustav had already left for Crimea, and so couldn't have had a conversation with Thomas about his plans for the war. More importantly, though, the carved train did not resemble the depiction we recognise as Thomas. That Thomas is based on an [LB&amp;SCR E2 class train](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LB%26SCR_E2_class), and was the subject of much debate between Rev. Awdry and the illustrators of the *Thomas* stories. Ultimately, Awdry was pleased by the depiction, but the fact that there was debate showed that the image of Thomas we know and love didn't exist before it was in the book. It didn't exist prior to 1946. This image of Thomas couldn't have been having a conversation with Gustav because it didn't exist.\n\nIn short, I am dreadfully disappointed with the gross historical inaccuracies in this image. I'd write a grumpy letter, but I've found that sending grumpy letters addressed to \"the internet\" just doesn't accomplish much. Hopefully, though, the artist will see this post and realise the truly horrendous errors of his ways. \n\nSources: [This thing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjBTsoYph48)",

People suffered instantaneous catastrophic changes in their fortune. And the cause of all of this actually was well understood, five hundred years ago. It was witchcraft. And happily, the Church had produced some very energetic men who had the gumption to deal with this problem. And so every year some hundreds and sometimes thousands of women were burned alive for casting spells on their neighbors.\n\nNitpicks first:\n\n* \"Hundreds and sometimes thousands\" is way too high. Giving as low an interpretation to those numbers as I reasonably can, I still get twice as many victims as any credible estimate. Harris should have said \"scores and sometimes hundreds.\"\n\n* At risk of sounding like a Twitter campaign, not all women. They were the predominant victims but men were a significant fraction.\n\n* Most victims of execution for witchcraft were not burned. The most common method was hanging.\n\nNow, here's the real *crux* of it (ha, ha):\n\n&gt; And happily, the Church had produced some very energetic men who had the gumption to deal with this problem. And so...\n\n**The majority of witch trial victims were condemned by secular courts.** If you *did* find yourself accused of witchcraft, it was generally *safer* to be brought up before an Inquisition than a secular court; you were more likely to be acquitted or let off lightly.\n\nMoreover, \"the\" Church is a misnomer, as witch panic was an early modern phenomenon, and Protestants, once they emerged, were at least as concerned with witchcraft as Catholics.\n\nIf you want to blame the Church for something related to witchcraft, blame them for giving in to popular pressure and redefining witchcraft from \"a pagan superstition that isn't real\" to \"a pact with the Devil to work evil magic.\" That's real, and had baleful consequences. But the picture of witchcraft accusations as driven by The Church, sending out its bloody-minded Inquisitors to root out the witches, is long since debunked.\n\n----\n\nStark, R. (2003).

Suggested origins are the Indus Valley Civilisation (2600-1900 BCE) and pre-Vedic north-eastern India, the Vedic civilisation (1500-500 BCE), and the sramana-movement (starting ca. 500 BCE).\n\nClearly, way before the 1960s. Now I'm giving them the benefit of doubt and assuming that they're talking about the advent of yoga in western civilization. Even then, they're wrong.  \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga#Reception_in_the_West\n&gt;The first Hindu teacher to actively advocate and disseminate aspects of yoga to a western audience, Swami Vivekananda, toured Europe and the United States in the 1890s.  \n\n&gt;Theosophists also had a large influence on the American public's view of Yoga. Esoteric views current at the end of the 19th century provided a further basis for the reception of Vedanta and of Yoga with its theory and practice of correspondence between the spiritual and the physical. The reception of Yoga and of Vedanta thus entwined with each other and with the (mostly Neoplatonism-based) currents of religious and philosophical reform and transformation throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries.  \n\n&gt;During the 1910s and 1920s in the USA, yoga suffered a period of bad publicity due largely to the backlash against immigration, a rise in puritanical values, and a number of scandals. In the 1950s the United States saw another period of paranoia against yoga, but by the 1960s, western interest in Hindu spirituality reached its peak, giving rise to a great number of Neo-Hindu schools specifically advocated to a western public.\n\nI removed a few parts from the wikipedia article, those that weren't cited.  \n\nTl;dr: The fact remains that yoga was known to westerners well before 1960, although it was after that that yoga gained a lot of popularity. Furthermore, you cannot say that yoga was \"invented\" at any date in history either, since the origins of yoga itself are unclear.",

        "text": "Edward Gibbon is a very, very famous man. But fame is not what it once was, and it’s quite possible that people reading this are not familiar with who he was. Gibbon was born in the town of Putney (in the county of Surrey in England for anyone not intimately familiar with British geography) in 1737, who mostly spent his life either visiting social clubs and writing before dying in 1794 at the age of 56. What he wrote about was mostly history, and he eventually produced what may be the most well known work on Roman history produced in the modern English language- *The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire*. This work tends to come up very frequently in both AskHistorians and BadHistory, usually as the prime example of an author unfortunately losing out to the march of time. However, he also tends to come up because there are people who still use him as their primary source on Roman history, though usually in ever-decreasing numbers, and there are people who recommend him as an introductory source.\n\nThis post is not about tearing down Edward Gibbon. If we were to look at his work and compare it to modern methodology, source use, and even writing style, it would be the BadHistory equivalent of destroying errant pottery with a stick of dynamite. Once it was expected that great historical works would remain relevant and mostly accurate for centuries afterwards, and now a work on Roman history is exceedingly lucky if it gets more than two decades as being up-to-date and relevant before being shifted to the ‘of purely historiographical interest’ column. Works from the 1950s seem like terrible history to our eyes for the most part, so of course a series of volumes written across the 1770s and 1780s is not going to fit with modern methodology. There is no need for a post treating Gibbon like he’s the equivalent of a 21st century quack pseudo-historian.\n\nSo what am I doing, why is this post in BadHistory? It’s for two reasons- I like to post about historical bad history, his contemporaries and immediate antecedents are ripe for the picking . Gibbon essentially represents the vanguard of the movement which resulted in the creation of professional historians, and heavily contrasts with all of his contemporaries in the Anglo-French intelligensia. I’m going to point out how he differs, and what Gibbon considered to be bad historical methodology in his day. Whilst Gibbon is a sitting duck, very few of these contemporary works have been shown for how they don’t stand up to modern methodology, so I consider them utterly fair game. My second big goal is I want to point out a more universal historical conundrum- the balance between secondary and primary literature, and what results from using one or the other exclusively. This period of literature, Gibbon included, provides a lot of material for that.\n\nAs indicated earlier, there was no conception of a professional historian or classicist in 18th century England or France. Everyone with sufficient education, particularly those who went to university, was assumed to be able to deal with Greek and Latin, (and everyone educated in England was presumed to be able to translate French as well). Thus the term of choice to describe the community of scholars used within this period is *literati*. This is a somewhat ironic term when used now, but was used entirely seriously then. The Anglo-French historians of this era are a general scattering of crumbs across the top of society, and almost any member of the upper reaches of society seems to have either delved into Classical philology or commented on Classical history at some point. I’ll delve into specific figures from the period in a second, but to give a general indication of their backgrounds and careers- the sons of MPs, sitting MPs, Jesuit fathers, the sons of rich farmers, the sons of reverends. Even those whose university education was defined by poorer backgrounds were generally the children of minor clergy members. This, then, was the social matrix through which comments on the Classics arose.\n\nIn the late 17th and early 18th century, there arose a desire for a comprehensive overview of Roman history in its complete span, particularly for one in English. Attempts at comprehensive ‘History of the World’ type affairs had existed, and had partially succeeded, such as William Howell’s *An Institution of General History* from the 1680s. Indeed, there was also a growing desire for works which united western history with the known history of the rest of the world in the 18th century as well. But there was a specific desire for a summative, but comprehensive, work on Classical history and most especially one focused on the Romans in particular. And thus many authors attempted to fill this niche; Hooke, Echard, Catrou, Rollin, Vertot, and eventually Gibbon. The actual end results illustrate a lot of issues with the methodology of the day, mostly with source criticism and the focus on secondary literature. A lot of the meat of professional history involves criticism of the work of others. But when you look at the works outside of Gibbon, you find that in this period it expresses itself very differently to modern academia. And this is *not* just due to semantic shifts in how we interpret certain words. For example, Nathaniel Hooke published *Roman History, from the Building of Rome to the Ruin of the Commonwealth* across four volumes in the 1730s-1770s. This was an attempt at something similar in quality and scope to what Gibbon would eventually write. But Nathaniel Hooke’s work is not spoken of with great reverence or even really remembered, except among scholars of 18th century literature. Its approach to what we’d call source criticism is part of why.\n\nPrefaces are a very usual feature of large books, or even some small books, so the fact that one exists in Hooke’s volumes is not unusual. What is very unusual for a modern reader is the fact that most of the preface is dedicated to Hooke explicitly bashing his peers, or lionising others. I don’t know about anyone else, but my experience in reading prefaces tends to expect something actually talking about your work, not about how bad the other person’s stuff is. But combative introductions and prefaces exist, and who even reads prefaces? But what we encounter next is an entire section, before the first chapter has even begun, that is entirely dedicated to refuting Isaac Newton’s assertions about how long ago the Romans were ruled by Kings, and for how long. Yes, that Isaac Newton, this is what I meant when I said that any member of the *literati* felt they could and should comment on other people’s Classical scholarship. Hooke here has no notion that a comprehensive work on such a big subject would be limited and dated by including specific responses to incredibly specific essays of the period, or even that they would be a distraction. Nor does this stop when you finally do reach the meat in this hoagie, because he spends as much time going ‘l*ook at me, I made this argument and I said this, look at me*!’ as he does actually attempting to summarise Roman history, and is unable to consistently keep sections focused on a single topic, or in chronological order. But the problem of works being overtly focused on bashing other scholars is not one that applies solely to Hooke’s work. This is a general truism of almost all of the scholarship done in this period, entire essays were purely titled after the specific author and book/essay/review they were refuting, and the closest things to scholarly reviews read more like diatribes about how awful someone is (whether it be the author of the work, or their detractors). \n\nHere’s another example that involves Hooke. He wrote an essay with such a long title I’m loathe to reproduce it here, because the title enumerated the full title of every single one of the works he was refuting or commenting on. This was then followed by a scatching review of the paper, by one Sir William Hamilton. Scathing may in fact be an understatement- at one point he compares Hooke to Queen Mary burning Protestants at the stake, by way of saying that the methodology of criticism did not create new converts but made its author a hypocrite instead. The review is thus incredibly entertaining to read, but it simply continues the chain, because that review elicited a response from yet another party to add to the pile. And this applies to French work in the period as well, such as a work by one Francois Catrou, a Jesuit father, simply titled *Histoire Romaine* (which also has critical notes supplied by Pierre Julien Rouillé).  Nor was this the only such French attempt at similar works which gets bogged down by treating other scholars as juicy melons to be squashed. Sniping at other authors to the detriment of the actual objective is constantly to be found in all the other pre-Gibbon attempts at a comprehensive Roman history. In fact, there’s almost nothing but secondary source criticism and response on display in scholarship of the period, there are almost no usage of primary sources except in authoring new translations or as an appeal to authority in some dispute with another scholar.\n\nPart of why Gibbon’s work makes an impact is that it leaves this entire attitude behind. His work, whilst having the same aims as his contemporary peers, is distinctly different. There is almost no mention of a single other scholar in the entirety of *Decline and Fall*, for one. There is no bashing of other works in the preface, there is no lengthy riposte to some other author’s work before Volume 1 begins in earnest, there are no lengthy asides about how clever his position in certain historiographical debates is. Part of why Gibbon is a breath of fresh air at this time, in this place, is that he actually concentrates on primary sources and summarising them to create a direct survey of general Roman history. It’s also just better written, being more concise in style, and more able to either keep things organised by chronology or by topic, but that’s a lot more subjective. It’s an easy read, and one where you feel like you’re getting what’s been advertised. But to turn to the second half of what I want to look at, it is also fighting one extreme with another.\n\nGibbon’s work, I think, is partially responsible for an attitude that’s still fairly common- that you can gain the most immediate and accurate insight into ancient history by reading the primary literary sources. Part of the reason that Gibbon was behaving like that is because in the long term, focusing solely on primary sources is better than focusing purely on secondary literature. When the choices are between those extreme, one is better than the other. A scholarly world that is just people commenting on commenting on commenting, where almost nobody is actually reading and engaging primary source material, is going to get old really fast. In context his decision makes absolute sense. But this only applies when you are forced to choose between these two extremes, and that is a key difference between Gibbon’s time and our own. Focusing on primary literature without any kind of tutoring or secondary literature cuts you off from solid, established work contextualising the text. It means that at best you will usually end up reinventing the wheel. And oftentimes it’s a case of you coming up with conclusions that seem like utterly logical common sense, without realising why that’s not the case, especially because a large part of common sense is somewhat personal and temporal in nature. It also means you cut yourself off from the ideas of others which can further inspire and direct your work. The ability to build on other people’s ideas without plagiarising, and the knack of utilising primary and secondary evidence in equal measure, are both key tenets of modern academic history.\n\nAnd this is why I think the historiography surrounding Gibbon’s work is great for illustrating how extreme approaches to source material ultimately creates bad history. I also hope that people enjoyed a little trip to Yon Elder Bad Historia, seeing the kind of issues that Gibbon was actively trying to correct. Neither am I inventing his motivations out of thin air- he is actually the author of one of the first modern autobiographies, so we have quite an unusually comprehensive insight into his stated goals, and I can thus state confidently that his shift in approach to source material was on purpose, ‘cause he said so.\n\n**CHEAP BONUS BAD-STUFF**\n\n*Cheap BadLinguistics*- At least one author asserts that the etymology of Italia is that it dervives from the Greek region Aitolia. \n\n*Cheap BadHistory*- Almost every single author affirms the utter trustworthiness of Aeneas founding the Latin race by bringing over Trojan refugees.

        "text": "Today in articles-Quouar-found-linked-and-decided-to-spend-too-much-time-on, I will be discussing [this article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/letters/11128427/Why-the-greater-writers-are-conservatives.html) and its...interesting assertions about the history of English literature. While the article has been discussed from a literary perspective in /r/badliterarystudies, I'd like to look at it through a historical lens. A grumpy historical lens.\n\nThis particular letter to the editor features the idea that conservatives are the ones responsible for the \"really original work\" in English literature. Now, there are several ways to approach this. I know that not every great author of the 20th century could be considered \"conservative\" (though what the letter's author means by \"conservative\" is not entirely clear, seeing as it's a flexible term, especially going back through history). There are plenty that are, but there are plenty that are not. Equally, I don't really know what's meant by \"really original work.\" Personally, I find Irvine Welsh to be rather original, but seeing as the letter is a reaction against Welsh's comments, I suspect the author disagrees. Because of this (and because I like to pretend that this is a refutation of an article rather than me rambling for a few thousand words), I'll stick with the one clear assertion that is made and which isn't couched in subjective terms, namely:\n\n&gt; They don’t come much more conservative than Ezra Pound\n\nAre you ready? It's going to be an interesting ride.\n\nSo then. Mr. Ezra Pound. He's a rather extraordinary figure, politics aside. He's responsible for much of what we think of as early 20th century English-language literature. As a publisher, he pushed authors like Hemingway, Eliot, Joyce, and Frost to write and publish, shaping their work along the way. He's like the Liszt of the literature world, popularising, funding, and being an all-around useful fellow to know. Even in his own right, his poetry is influential, though mired in controversy. He is known for popularising a style of poetry known as [imagism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagism), and is considered one of the great figures of early modernism. \n\nRemember when I said Pound was mired in controversy? Well, Pound was a bit of a Fascist. And by \"a bit of a Fascist,\" I mean, full on went to Italy fell in love with Mussolini and wrote Italian Fascist propaganda until he was captured by the Allies and nearly executed for treason in 1945. His work is steeped in Fascist ideology, and he wrote anti-Semitic propaganda. He's an interesting guy.\n\nFascism, though, is an interesting ideology. It doesn't fit neatly on the spectrum of conservative-liberal, snatching bits of thought from one side or another and blending them all together. It could be that a Fascist is also a very conservative person, while Fascism as a whole doesn't necessarily have to be. Equally, it might be that a Fascist is somewhat liberal, picking and choosing their ideologies and their personal beliefs. But to explain Fascism and why Pound being a Fascist doesn't automatically make Pound a conservative, let's consider what's Fascism is. Fascism does agree with conservativism on a lot of issues, including nationalism and a preservation of private property. However, Fascism also tends to want to shift large-scale capitalism from the hands of private individuals to the state, and will break with tradition fairly easily. In these regards, it doesn't resemble conservativism at all. \n\nHowever, Pound was infatuated with Italian Fascism, specifically, which is another beast entirely. Around 1919, the Italian Fascist movement was just beginning, and could be considered both radical and anti-capitalist. [The Manifesto of the Italian Fasci of Combat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascist_Manifesto) included many social advances, including universal suffrage, a minimum wage, and a lowering of retirement age. However, by 1924 when Pound was living in Italy, Italian Fascism was co-operating with Italian conservative parties, moderating their policies. However, in the 1930s, Italian Fascism radicalised again. It is at this point that Pound can be recorded as having fallen head over heels in love with Fascism, even going so far as to meet Mussolini in 1933. In 1939, he started writing anti-Semitic and pro-Fascist propaganda for Mussolini's government. When war broke out, he wrote letters to American politicians, arguing that the US should stay out of the war because it was an international Jewish banking conspiracy.\n\nAll of this seems like it's beating around the bush regarding Pound's political leanings. He wrote and broadcast Fascist propaganda, but also stated that his greatest fear was an economy based on militarism. He published huge anti-Semitic polemics, but threw tradition and the requirements of a traditional society out the window. His *Cantos* are chock-full of Fascism and pro-Italianism, but yet he had two families and seemed to not care too terribly much about the constraints of a traditional lifestyle. The trouble here is that Ezra Pound was an individual with wildly complex beliefs, most of which got him into trouble at one point or another. \n\nWas he conservative, though? That's ultimately the question. There are those out there who say he wasn't *really* a Fascist, but I think that's unlikely. He's pretty Fascist, and a large Mussolini fanboy, and the *Cantos* are full of Fascist ideologies (thus the controversy surrounding them). Equally, \"Fascist\" doesn't necessarily mean \"conservative,\" no more than \"anti-Semite\" must by definition mean \"commits genocide.\" There are elements of conservativism in Fascism, certainly, and Pound does display some of these in both his writings and his speeches. However, he also displays liberal elements in how he lived, his writing, and his outlook on life. If it is the case, as the author argues, that there is no one more conservative than Pound, then I'm not sure \"conservative\" means what the author wants it to mean. Pound was many things, but conservative as they come? Not particularly.\n\nAs for the assertion that all great 20th century literature came from conservatives? That's just wrong.\n\nHelpful source: [This](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/06/09/the-pound-error) is an interesting article about Pound and his life, if you'd like to do more reading.",

I'm not really going to talk a whole lot about this because I don't really know a whole lot about the current debate. I *do* know that some historians (or many historians?) dispute the [Hockney-Falco thesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockney%E2%80%93Falco_thesis) supported in *Tim's Vermeer* on the grounds that, regardless of the convenience of a \"common origin\" technological in nature being responsible for the pictorial shift towards more natural perspective in Northern Renaissance painting c. 1420, the materials/processes for creating lenses were not in the condition to fulfill the requirements, and argue that there just plain isn't any *evidence* that either Vermeer, his predecessors, or contemporaries made any attempt towards creating a \"secret\" camera lucida. \n\n\n2) That tracing a \"projected\" image would make Vermeer the *first* photographer. [\"Projection\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_obscura) is in fact much older than that. I put it in quotes simply because optical projection (the type of projection argued in the Hockney-Falco thesis) was not around until what historians date back to c. 1550, when the earliest textual evidence of optical glass dates back to. The *camera obscura* is basically a pinhole image projected through a small hole from the outside onto a screen in a dark room. Textual evidence over this device is aplenty, dating back millennia (the earliest theorized occurrence is from around the 5th century BCE).\n\n3)  That tracing a \"projected\" image would make Vermeer the first *photographer*. That's just not what photography is. Photography is the chemical ingraining of the image onto a surface, the first documented being Niepce's [heliograph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliography) (which is actually super cool if you're around Austin, you should check it out). Tracing a projected image isn't photography. In fact the *insufficiency* of attempting to trace a projected image (bear in mind *these* images would be with lenses 360 years *more advanced* than Vermeer's) was one of the primary factors motivating artists like Daguerre and Talbot to create the photograph-- the former with the Daguerreotype, the latter with the development of the paper-based photo.\n\nAs for Vermeer's use of image-tracing-- it was not the *first*, and it was certainly not *photography*.\n\nSources: \n\n1. Naomi Rosenblum's *World History of Photography*\n\n2. Sven Dupre's \"Introduction the Hockney-Falco Thesis: Constraints and Opportunities\", *Early Science and Medicine*\n\n[Here](http://np.reddit.com/r/badarthistory/comments/2hr6gm/if_that_guys_theory_is_right_vermeer_was_the/ckvbj67) are some insightful comments by /u/quietuus and /u/toadnovak. As the former points out, the theory isn't totally bunk, and there are some interesting conceptual implications to be made with such a thesis, as it can act as a sort of creative statement by Hockney which is pretty cool I think.",

        "text": "[Here's the article.](http://www.lewrockwell.com/2013/07/thomas-dilorenzo/who-caused-the-1861-65-bloodbath/) I only have one post where I do a thorough breakdown of DiLorenzo's style of argument, but from my own recollection. Figured I might as well take apart one of his articles. In case any of you aren't aware, Thomas DiLorenzo is an Austrian school economics professor at Loyola University Maryland, who is of the Libertarian/Anarcho-Capitalist brand of ideology who revises history to suit his economic and political beliefs, and has been discredited by virtually every historical expert in the historical topics he's addressed, most notably the American Civil War and the New Deal.\n\nI’m going to give an overall criticism, but there's so much here that I know this is going to be a pretty skeletal refutation, so please add to it.\n\n&gt;No respectable historian believes the Deep North/government school fantasy that enlightened and morally-superior Northerners elected Abe Lincoln so that they could go to war and die by the hundreds of thousands solely for the benefit of black strangers in the “deep South.” \n\nThis sentence confuses me for several reasons. One, I've never heard the 'Deep North' used and I'm not exactly sure why that's used as a term, if not to give an intimation of his pro-Southern bias in interpretation of this history. I'm also not sure why 'deep' isn't capitalized at the end of the sentence, and why it's put in quote marks if not for some obscure way of doing the same. Obviously there's some sort of motivation behind this language that requires critical analysis, which is ironic because he applies very little of such analysis to his interpretation of the primary documents that he uses to make his points on Lincoln and the ACW. Also, I've never heard anyone argue that Northerners elected Lincoln for the purpose of starting a war with the South. DiLorenzo's entirely fabricating that narrative, pulling it out from the Deep North of his ass.\n\n&gt;Fleming has discovered what scholars such as the late, great Murray Rothbard and the not-late-but-still-great Clyde Wilson wrote about many years ago: A war was not necessary to end slavery – the rest of the world did it peacefully; only 6 percent of adult Southern men owned slaves, which means that the average Confederate soldier was not fighting to preserve a system that actually harmed him and his family economically; and that the real cause of the war was what Fleming calls a “malevolent envy” of the South by New England “Yankees” who waged a war of economic conquest.\n\nA few things:\n\nFleming's work does ask an intriguing question, albeit one that isn't really all that novel—plenty of historians have addressed this in the past, though not necessarily as the central aspect of their work. That question is why it took the U.S. a Civil War to end slavery, against what several other examples in Europe and the Western Hemisphere tell us. DiLorenzo is manipulating the intent of the question as well as how Fleming approaches it, by using it to suggest a history of Northern antagonism towards the South over federal control being the cause of the growing sectionalism that led to the war. Fleming approaches this from two sides, focusing on extreme viewpoints in the North and South over incompatible ideals leading to this sectionalism and eventually disunion, while DiLorenzo essentially removes the Southern radicalism from the equation and frames the rift as one of the North expressing a collective envy of Southern leadership since the early Republic. So, contrary to Fleming’s account, DiLorenzo is more or less ignoring the mutual antagonism and fanaticism to advance his argument, which is a very dishonest use of another author's work. He moreover asserts, gathering the numbers (I believe) from Fleming, that only six percent of Free southerners owned slaves, and hence slavery represents a minority interest and one that is actually harmful to the interests of most Southerners. [That's a somewhat correct statistic depending on how you define the South,](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2hrtxe/rwtf_and_slavery_apologia_the_problems_with/) but the conclusion is so poorly derived that it alone is a solid reason to repudiate any credibility one might assign to DiLorenzo in talking about the war, and is something that you might find in literature printed by the Sons of Confederate Veterans or the Klan. The truth of the matter is that plenty of middle sorts did own slaves, even if the owners of large-scale plantations with upwards of one hundred salves were a small portion relatively, and individuals owning more than twenty slaves were about 12% of all individuals who did own slaves. In spite of a poor underclass, this does not mean that attachment to slavery wasn't very high. A better way to break this down is by looking at households, as individuals in households that built their wealth on slave labor would've been much more likely to favor slavery over a poor southern male or female from a non-slaveowning family (such as Abraham Lincoln). I quote myself, with figures taken directly from the 1860 census:\n\n&gt;If we take the South as a whole, then the percentage comes out to about 27%, but with a wide range of figures by state. Mississippi comes in highest at 49%, while Delware comes lowest at a mere 3%. Now, because there's wide variation between the Upper South and the Deep South, I'm going to break that down as well. For the Upper South (which includes DE, MD, KY, MO, TN, VA, AK, and NC), the figure comes out to 18.75%, with NC having the highest figure for any individual state at 28%. For the Deep South it comes out to 36.86%, with the lowest figure being LA at 20%. These figures better show the extent of attachment to slavery, while they still don't reveal concentration of slavery among the wealthy. \n\nEven still, non-slaveowners would've been largely supportive of slavery, for economic reasons—like being able to rent slaves, or to maintain the prospect of one day owning slaves and becoming wealthy through slavery—but for other reasons as well. I believe in this case DiLorenzo is either lying about what he's read, hasn't read any contrary arguments, or is conflating 1860 support for secession with support for slavery. I know I mention this work a lot here, but Freehling's *Road to Disunion* does an excellent job of detailing how secession came about in spite of overwhelming objection to it, drawing his narrative from the election of Lincoln to the delay of secession in Charleston, to the completion of the Charleston-Savannah railroad and expression of support from several Georgian politicians in the instance of secession, to the catalysis that was South Carolinian secession (which was far from an aberration as a cause, but merely novel in its enactment). South Carolina had been the only state with a secessionist majority, but had otherwise been terrified of actually going through with it. With Buchanan's decision to reinforce Ft. Sumter following Major Anderson's retreat from Ft. Moultrie, fear of reinforcements of other Union installations in the South still under Union control prompted the rest of the Deep South to get behind South Carolina. It's one of those instances where a wealthy minority, circumstances, and misinterpretation of intent forced a more major crisis in spite of opposition to secession immediately after Lincoln's election alone. \n\nThis is an entirely separate issue from whether Southerners overwhelmingly agreed with slavery, which they did. Their failure to initially get behind secession was done with the help of the fact that Lincoln presented no anti-slavery stance, and promised not to interfere with slavery where it already existed, even if he would not compromise on halting its expansion. The largest salve interests were not satisfied still, but a majority nevertheless were willing to delay secession in order to see if he would take more radical measures against slavery. So, these political circumstances aside, one has to take pro-slavery sentiment in its social as well as economic context. I've rambled a bit too much here, so take [the following](http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/civil-war-overview/why-non-slaveholding.html) from Gordon Rhea:\n\n&gt;Fear of a slave rebellion was palpable.  The establishment of a black republic in Haiti and the insurrections, threatened and real, of Gabriel Prosser, Denmark Vesey, and Nat Turner stoked the fires.  John Brown’s raid at Harper’s Ferry sent shock waves through the south.  Throughout the decades leading up to 1860, slavery was a burning national issue, and political battles raged over the admission of new states as slave or free.  Compromises were struck – the Missouri Compromise, the Compromise of 1850 – but the controversy could not be laid to rest.\n\n&gt;The South felt increasingly beleaguered as the North increased its criticism of slavery.  Abolitionist societies sprang up, Northern publications demanded the immediate end of slavery, politicians waxed shrill about the immorality of human bondage, and overseas, the British parliament terminated slavery in the British West Indies.  A prominent historian accurately noted that “by the late 1850’s most white Southerners viewed themselves as prisoners in their own country, condemned by what they saw as a hysterical abolition movement.”\n\n&gt;As Southerners became increasingly isolated, they reacted by becoming more strident in defending slavery.  The institution was not just a necessary evil: it was a positive good, a practical and moral necessity.  Controlling the slave population was a matter of concern for all Whites, whether they owned slaves or not.  Curfews governed the movement of slaves at night, and vigilante committees patrolled the roads, dispensing summary justice to wayward slaves and whites suspected of harboring abolitionist views.  Laws were passed against the dissemination of abolitionist literature, and the South increasingly resembled a police state.  A prominent Charleston lawyer described the city’s citizens as living under a “reign of terror.”\n\nIn sum, it's correct to say that a small percentages of white Southerners were harmed by slavery. Perhaps a larger number economically, which Lincoln said of his father's reasons for moving from Kentucky to Indiana. But slavery was the foundation of the South that kept them secure economically and politically, and secured the safety of white southerners, in their view, from the inevitable consequences of agitation and abolition. For the upper classes is it was more a matter of a deeply held Burkean conservatism that maintained that the present order of things—social, political, economic—were as they were for unchanging reasons, moreover an institution serving as an essential base of the great societies of history. That was to some extent held by the middle and lower classes as well, but among all of them, the security it provided them was a foundational justification for their attitudes.\n\nBack to the article:\n\n&gt;The standard “answer” to this question, which I have asked many times in my own writings, is that Southern plantation owners were by far the most evil human beings in world history, far more evil than British slave owners, [etc.]. Therefore, no peaceful means of ending slavery was ever possible.\n\nHere's an argument that no historian really argues, as slavery was awful everywhere and not objectively comparable. So, if he's refuting an argument here in a decisive manner, it's really them tearing down his own straw man. The more acceptable answer, and one that is argued by antebellum and Civil War historians, is that the U.S. was a unique case in the sense that the cultural, political, and economic circumstances all made even gradual abolition unthinkable to Southerners, while radical abolitionism in the North set an agenda that exacerbated more mainstream tensions over the expansion of slavery at a crucial moment, all explaining why the war happened when it did. The value of slaves simply as property in the U.S. (that's excluding value of their production over the average lifetime) amounted to a number not seen anywhere else: Eric Foner puts it at about $4, while David Blight puts it at no less than $3.5 billion—both agreeing that this exceeds to total value of all the value of industry, financial institutions, and infrastructure (railroads, etc.) in the U.S. combined, and as a category of property can only be exceeded by that of land. Moreover, in the context of steady demand due to growing textiles industry in the North as well as in England and elsewhere, demand for cotton remained strong. And, wherever there was other industry in the South, slavery remained compatible, as demonstrated by the employment of slaves in Virginia coal mines, or the employment of some 400-500 slaves in the Tredegar Iron Works in Richmond. There was simply no incentive for Southerners to give up slavery even with compensation, and the economics can only account for so much. To reiterate from above, it was a matter of economic prosperity as well as personal security.\n\n&gt;Slavery only benefited the slave-owners who exploited the slaves but was economically harmful to all the rest of Southern society because slave labor is inherently inferior to free labor. \n\nUntrue. I've appealed to the social aspect of this, but there were also some 97.3k households owning between 10-49 slaves, and 187k owning between 1-4. Appeal to individuals owning slaves is a fundamentally flawed way of looking at the ubiquity of slavery in the South, and in DiLorenzo's account, is most certainly done with the intention of misleading to suit his agenda, which is to downplay the importance of slavery in disunion and thereby exculpate Southerners of their sinister intentions in seeking an end DiLorenzo *personally* agrees with. There is reason to believe that free labor is more efficient than slave labor, but this is an application of a presentist perspective. It does not reveal how Southerners felt about slavery, which is the only thing of interest in what DiLorenzo is arguing.\n\n&gt;Moreover, the average Confederate soldier, who was a yeoman farmer who owned no slaves, was harmed by the slave-owning plantation owners through unfair competition.\n\nPerhaps in effect, but not to their knowledge, and humans to not form opinions based on rationality alone, especially if the reason for their poverty (which is still a tenuous argument) is not known to them. Slavery benefited them in the additional sense that they could be kept a caste apart from the worse abjection Southern life had to offer. Fear over competition would've been a greater fear if abolition were to take place, and this is demonstrated by Northern factory workers' resentment of the cause of the war post-issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation, with the NY Draft Riots being the worst manifestation of this hatred towards blacks and emancipation.",

        "text": "So I was reading the pinnacle of literature, the Zombie Survival Guide By Max Brooks, and came around this little piece of bad gun history. Gun and military history being one of the few things I know quite a bit about, I decided to make my first post on here after lurking for a while now.  Disclaimer: I have no idea how to use quoting and stuff like that in reddit, so I'm just putting quotes around anything I quote from the passage. I'm also not the best at formatting, as I have very Little experience with reddit outside of a mobile device.\n\n“The U.S. Army M16A1 is considered by many to be the worst assault rifle ever invented. Its overcomplicated mechanism is both difficult to clean and prone to jamming. Adjusting the sight, something that must be done every time a target shifts its range, requires the use of a nail, ballpoint pen, or similar device. What if you didn’t have one, or lost it as several dozen zombies shambled steadily toward you? The delicate plastic stock of the M16A1 obviates bayonet use, and by attempting to use it as such you would risk shattering the hollow, spring-loaded stock. This is a critical flaw. If you were confronted by multiple ghouls and your A1 jammed, you would be unable to use it as a last-ditch hand-to-hand weapon. In the 1960s, the M16 (originally the AR-15) was designed for Air Force base security. For political reasons typical of the military-industrial complex (you buy my weapon, you get my vote and my campaign contribution), it was adopted as the principal infantry weapon for the U.S. Army. So poor was its early battle record that during the Vietnam War, communist guerrillas refused to take them from dead Americans. The newer M16A2, although somewhat of an improvement, is still regarded as a second-class weapon. If given the choice, emulate the Vietcong and ignore the M16 entirely.\n\n\nR5: First things first. THE M16A1 IS NOT THE WORST ASSAULT RIFLE EVER. The military can be incompetent, but if the base  gun sucked, it wouldn’t still be the base of the US’ main rifle nearly half a century later. Ok, moving on. \"Its overcomplicated mechanism is both difficult to clean and prone to jamming.” This claim isn’t entirely egregious. The original M16 had quite a few issues. It jammed A lot. Like, a whole lot. There were several reasons behind this, including the fact that the M16 was marketed to the US army as self cleaning, and it wasn’t sent overseas with a cleaning kit. Surprise surprise, it wasn’t self cleaning. When it was tested in idea conditions, with Colts chosen ammunition, it was, but in the humid jungles of southern Asia, using the military’s standard ammunition (which was quite a bit more corrosive than the ammunition colt used) it jammed and there was no way to clean it. It also had a steel chamber, instead of a chrome one which led to pitting and rust. It also had a extremely high cyclic rate which led to casings being caught in the cycling bolt. This was also fixed in later models, with the removal of automatic fire by replacing it with a 3 round burst option, however all m16a1 models maintained a fully automatic mode. The m16a1 model fixed quite a few issues with the m16, including replacing the steel chambers with chrome, a forward assist, and were issued with cleaning kits. The military also started using a new type of ammunition that caused less fouling which helped with the jamming issues. However there were still quite a few issues with the M16a1, but with proper maintenance it would operate fine. \n\n\"Adjusting the sight, something that must be done every time a target shifts its range, requires the use of a nail, ballpoint pen, or similar device.” This is just plain false. While I can’t comment on how to adjust the zero on an original M16, the M16A1 had a knob that you could turn to adjust you elevation, and another you could turn to adjust windage. I don’t know where the authors getting this piece of information, as I couldn’t find any reference to the use of a pen or nail to adjust sights anywhere. Moving on. \"The delicate plastic stock of the M16A1 obviates bayonet use, and by attempting to use it as such you would risk shattering the hollow, spring-loaded stock.” Once again, Im not sure where Brooks is getting his information here. Every m16 variant used by the US army has had a bayonet lug. While its true that the m16/a1 variants did have relatively weak stocks, I’m not sure what this would have to do with bayonet effectiveness. \n\n\"In the 1960s, the M16 (originally the AR-15) was designed for Air Force base security.

Thats a pretty bold statement to make about the rifle that the Army has based their main infantry weapon off for the last half a century. Its also completely false. The Ar-15, Armalite/Colts name for the M16, was based of the Ar-10, a 7.62x51mm battle rifle that lost out against the M14 in military testing. A rifle that would fire a smaller .22 round at an extreme velocity, giving similar results to a 7.62 sized rifle but weighing significantly less and producing less recoil was requested by the military, and Armalite entered the Ar-15, a scaled down Ar-10 designed to fire a .223 round. the rifle was successful in testing, and was sent overseas to be tested by special forces.

(i.e. right brained, this type of stuff is really fussy, and we don’t know much about brain lateralization. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateralization_of_brain_function\nhttp://www.livescience.com/39373-left-brain-right-brain-myth.html)\n\nThen the Lemurians built cities on the vortexes depending on who they were (not explained) but they left 2 empty! He cites this document (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Codex_(Maya)) proving that there were 10 cities, howeverm this really isn’t relevent at all, and I think he just made it up. But is it a very cool document describing everyday life, [here](http://archive.org/stream/astudymanuscrip00unkngoog/astudymanuscrip00unkngoog_djvu.txt) is a digitized version.\n\n**[\\[07:25\\]](http://youtu.be/uAm-kbzT7xw?t=7m25s) [PIC21](http://i.imgur.com/xJquj9F.png)**\n\nTwo E.T.s filled these holes. \n\nThe first?\n\nTIME. TRAVELING. ALIEN. SPACE. JEWS. I shit you not. From the future. \n\nThey were very good at ‘left-brain stuff’ like math, but apparently sucked at spirituality, so they had to redo it. Anyways, we taught them stuff, and they taught the Jews stuff and maybe Lemurians helped them with the Exodus, no one knows apparently. And everyone was friends!\n\n**[\\[08:40\\]](http://youtu.be/uAm-kbzT7xw?t=8m40s)  [PIC22](http://i.imgur.com/dIPSlP0.png)**\n\nBut then, the Martians came, after their plant was fucked up by the “Lucifer Experiment” TL;DR, reality cut itself off from itself as an experiment, because free will (yeah, I don’t understand it). Lucifer isn’t bad, he is just “another means of perceiving reality”\n\nThey failed, and just killed the planted.\n\nThese people are very “male” and “left brained” and they always fail, until they come to earth in the Merkava, or the \"Chariot of Ascension\" (its a Giant Star of David [PIC23](http://i.imgur.com/hPtAYT4.jpg) )\n\nThey built these on Mars, and left HUGE cities and mounds of rock, but that conveniently eroded, but if you get plastered and squint, you can almost see it.\n\n**[\\[10:59\\]](http://youtu.be/uAm-kbzT7xw?t=10m59s)  [PIC24](http://i.imgur.com/OciG5vm.png)**\n\nThen, the Martians went in and came to Earth, to occupy that last circle...\n\nAnyway, this is the end of part 1. Part 2 should come soon but this is really long, and I have school and stuff. Oddly enough too, this really doesn't have that much to do with U.S. History from 1867-1990. And I don’t think it will be on the AP test. I hope you like it.\n\nIf you will excuse me, I need a stiff drink.\n\n(can I borrow someone's ID?)\n",
