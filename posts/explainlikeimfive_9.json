U 235 -&gt; u 236 -&gt; Ba141 + kr92 + 3 neutrons + Q) but why is Q (energy) produced.\nMass is maintained so I don't see why it needs to release energy especially one so disproportionate to its mass. Is it the break of the strong nuclear force that causes such a large energy output ?",

I wish I could link some examples, but I don't think this sub allows links.

I just find it strange since youtubers can get a copyright infringement warning if their vlogs include popular songs. I would really appreciate some insight.",

TV manufacturers cannot charge $10k for basic 32 inch tvs. Honda cannot charge $200k for brand new Honda civic. Businesses charge what consumers tell them they will pay based on their purchasing habits.

If I am given any random object and there are many forces acting on it. Now, the object displaces only in one particular direction.

The displacement caused by that force alone for instance?",
