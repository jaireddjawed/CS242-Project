        "text": "I write this as a record and because I find it useful to read about others' journeys! I recently took the ACTFL Spanish Reading Proficiency Test (RPT) and scored Superior, which translates to C2 on the CEFR scale. \n\n**What I Did:** To improve reading, one must read! I continued the process here, [Spanish Reading from B2+ to a solid C1+](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/n8y4td/spanish_reading_from_b2_to_a_solid_c1_via_50/), by continuing to read books, newspaper articles, and comics, actually. I also read 1-2 pages daily from *Panorama literario de Chile* by Ra√∫l Silva Castro, a book providing an overview of Chilean literature, for several months. I chose that book because it was culturally informative and lexically dense--there was usually at least one new word or expression per page. And I worked through (and am still working through) the Anki decks created from the books I had read before. \n\n**What Was The Test Like:** Very straightforward. Remotely proctored. Fifteen passages, three multiple-choice questions each, over 45 minutes. The RPT is adaptive, so I felt like I was on the right track when the passages went from hard to medium (imo) and then stayed hard for the rest of the test. \n\nThe topics weren't surprising: health/medicine, literary criticism, politics, cultural practices, history. The questions were okay: There were quite a few where I felt like you could justify 3 out of 4 answers (\"What is the theme/topic of this passage?\"), but I reminded myself to not overthink. There were also several where I had to use the process of elimination--that is, I didn't think that the (presumably) right answer was good, but it was the only one left. There were no \"What does this word mean?\" questions; it was all main idea/author intent/the passage states/the passage implies. \n\n**How Does C2 Reading Feel?** I feel like there are very few normal texts that you could throw at me that I outright wouldn't understand; the last time that I was completely lost was reading a legal statute. [There was a recent reading challenge post](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/11pkzm2/challenge_how_much_do_you_understand/): For the three Spanish passages (so far), I found two new words total (gualdo(! interestingly enough) and paraulata, which I correctly guessed was a type of bird).\n\nI feel like reading is the most straightforward skill to acquire. This isn't the one that I felt that I had to prove, if that makes sense. But I am glad that it is official, as it clears my headspace for the remaining three that I do want outside feedback on. \n\n**What's Next?** I feel like it's about time to give writing another crack! I would like to have worked through my Anki decks beforehand, so there's no rush, but it's also been a year since C1, so I hope that sufficient progress has been made. And then listening and speaking.",

        "author": "whosdamike",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/11qaq4g/120_hours_of_comprehensible_input_for_thai/",
        "text": "I'm posting about my Comprehensible Input experience because when I search past posts, I don't see many personal stories about it, and most of them seem to be about Spanish. So, here's a different perspective that I hope someone in the future finds useful. Even if nobody else finds it useful, I hope to write more of these updates in the future and be able to look back at my subjective experience / progress.\n\nAlso thanks to /u/bildeglimt who is 1600+ hours into learning Thai this way and answered a lot of my questions about it a few weeks ago (when I was ~70 hours in).\n\n**My personal circumstances** (for context)\n\nI moved to Thailand 9 months ago. I work remotely doing consulting work and my hours are flexible though sometimes weird (due to timezone differences with my clients). \n\nI initially tried learning Thai for a few weeks in April 2022 in preparation to move to Thailand, but I didn't try very seriously and learned very little. Even after moving here, I didn't learn anything, as it's trivially easy to get stuck in an expat bubble full of English speakers (both foreigners and local Thai with good to great English proficiency).\n\nI started seeing a Thai girl in September 2022 and started learning Thai more seriously at the end of December. My partner is fully bilingual with English (started learning from age 3) but wants me to learn some Thai. She most enjoys being around bilingual people so she can switch between the two languages freely, so she thinks it'll be nice if I can understand some Thai when we're together. And I don't want to be one of those expats that doesn't learn the local language, so I decided to give it another shot.\n\nAfter some research, I decided to try Comprehensible Input. The theory behind it makes a lot of sense to me and fortunately Thai has the most extensive free online resources for graded comprehensible input. There's probably over 600 hours of material between the biggest channel [Comprehensible Thai](https://www.youtube.com/@ComprehensibleThai) (/u/Comprehensible_Thai) and various channels run by teachers such as [Understand Thai](https://www.youtube.com/@UnderstandThai), [Riam Thai](https://www.youtube.com/@riamthai1074), [Thai Conversation Cafe](https://www.youtube.com/@thaiconversationcafe1072), [Thai Growth Expert](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSEUqaRGUzul3n6f4WQ5JOA), and others.\n\n**Starting Out**\n\nInitially, it was difficult. My attention span isn't the greatest and the early B0 videos were a slog to get through. I started with 20-30 minutes a day. However, after about 20-30 hours, my listening improved and the topics became complicated enough to keep my attention. From there I gradually ramped up to 1 hour a day and finally to 2 hours a day. I've kept this up pretty consistently except for a 9 day gap in January when I went on a trip to Japan with my partner.\n\n**Comprehension Ability**\n\nAt this point, no huge revelations, but my vocabulary of comprehensible words has definitely grown. This isn't surprising as Thai is very different from English and I expect to need many hundreds of CI hours more than, for example, an English-to-Spanish learner would need.\n\nAt around 30 hours, Thai sounds became much more distinct to me, even at native speed. It didn't sound like \"noise\" the way a totally foreign language sometimes does.\n\nNow at 120 hours, I obviously can't comprehend native-level material, but I can catch words I know well. When watching the anime Demon Slayer in Thai, I recognize a word or two in almost every sentence. A far cry from comprehension, but I think about right for the hours I've put in.\n\n**Subjective Experience**\n\nSo, am I happy with my progress so far and learning this way?\n\nThis feels like the right method for me. I can feel my brain relaxing into the language as I sit and listen longer, and I do less \"translating\" into English, especially with words and phrases I know well. When I do translate, it feels like a belated and unnecessary step since I already comprehend, so I try to quiet that part of my brain.\n\nMy Thai partner has spoken to me in Thai with some slow/simple phrases and I can understand what she's saying, so that feels rewarding as well.\n\nIf you're considering learning Thai and wonder if Comprehensible Input works, then I really encourage you to give it a shot. The early videos can be a bit boring (\"man is running\", \"girl is sitting\") though the teachers are charismatic so that helps. \n\nBut the videos at the B1 level are much more engaging. Examples of the recent comprehensible lesson topics: Thai festivals, a joke about people from different countries sharing a cab, dreaming about spending 1 million baht, what to do when you have a broken heart.\n\nAt this point, it doesn't feel like studying. It's low effort and pretty painless, especially compared to traditional methods of grinding grammar, flash cards, or Anki (which is what I did for Japanese many years ago). It feels easy to stick to and even days when I'm lazy I can squeeze an hour of listening in. If language learning is a marathon, then I want it to feel as little like a chore as possible, and comprehensible input makes it feel fun and chill.\n\nP.S. Special shout out to Understand Thai. [Khroo Ying](https://www.instagram.com/khrooying/) is really, really good at making material comprehensible even for beginners, and she's even more engaging over a live call than in her recorded videos. Her listening seminars work out to about US$4.60 an hour, which is an absolute steal for the value. You can contact her directly on her [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/khrooying/) if you're interested or sign up for her seminars [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfKDTQA65pqQ0ep0mLh-suRjArD3UgkTtgPpf3-STTHoBWK6w/viewform).",

        "text": "From what I‚Äôve noticed, different languages have different ways to pronounce foreign words (especially names). Examples:\n\n- In Chinese, everything gets Sinicized. If the name is foreign, it almost always gets a phonetic approximation using matching Chinese characters. For instance, ‚ÄúJames‚Äù gets approximated as Ë©πÂßÜÊñØ (zhƒÅn m«î sƒ´) in Mandarin. The same applies for other Chinese dialects/languages.\n\n(Note that, if the name is Japanese, Chinese will pronounce it according to the Chinese pronunciations of the characters that are used. This is why many Chinese speakers may not know what city ‚ÄúNagoya‚Äù is, because in Chinese, ÂêçÂè§Â±ã is ‚Äúm√≠ng g«î w≈´.‚Äù)\n\n- English tends to Anglicize the pronunciations of everything, although there is considerable debate now in some English-speaking countries over whether English speakers should be doing this or should be aiming to pronounce it more accurately in the foreign language. For instance, seemingly all Spanish names in the US have an Anglicized pronunciation, and some who have Spanish names even primarily go by the Anglicized pronunciation.\n\n(Note that while there is debate over this, some of the more established names are not questioned. For instance, ‚ÄúLos Angeles,‚Äù despite having a Spanish name, has been under US control for so long that the Anglicized pronunciation is now ‚Äúcorrect.‚Äù)\n\n- Spanish, when dealing with English names, tends to aim for the accurate English pronunciation and does not try to Hispanicize (is that the right word?) it. I don‚Äôt know if Spanish does this with other languages though.\n\n- Like Chinese, Japanese seems to have to ‚ÄúJapanicize‚Äù foreign words (note that I‚Äôm not speaking of loanwords that have become a part of the language). However, unlike Chinese, Japanese seems to pronounce Chinese names the ‚ÄúChinese way,‚Äù even if the Chinese-style readings of the characters (Onyomi) don‚Äôt sound like modern Chinese. For instance, ‰∏äÊµ∑ (Shanghai) in Japanese is ‚ÄúShanhai‚Äù despite the Onyomi (or at least one of them) being ‚Äúj≈ç kai.‚Äù\n\n(My knowledge of Japanese is limited, so feel free to correct me if I missed anything.)\n\nHow does your language approach foreign words/names?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/11psuva/the_language_loner_demotivators_on_the_road_to/",
        "text": "Over the past few days, I've been thinking that one of the reasons that language learners often happen to be introverts--a notion quite counterintuitive when what comes to mind with foreign languages is the idea of extroverted, social, or spoken communication--is that learning a foreign language is largely a kind of solitary, out-group experience for the learner from beginning to end. Often feeling more socially isolated than their extroverted peers, introverts might find the idea of acceptance by another group in a foreign language and culture to be something worth fighting for through the process of hard work and solitude required to learn a foreign language well. \n\nUnfortunately, this is also an illusion, since you will never attain complete integration with another group, however skillful your use of language. It‚Äôs a question tied to a more philosophical notion of human solitude that I won‚Äôt really get into here, but it's useful for supporting my understanding of some of the common demotivators that tend to crop up while learning a foreign language.\n\nThese demotivators are social, in that the learner often encounters them in a social context while moving through the different stages of proficiency. One example at the more advanced levels of proficiency is that native speakers‚Äô expectations of you change somewhat drastically: at the lower levels, you‚Äôre an endearing foreigner doing them the honor of trying to learn their language, and people tend to find your linguistic facility cute or amusing; at the more advanced ones, you‚Äôre now the quasi-native speaker who can‚Äôt pronounce his T‚Äôs correctly, or who‚Äôs trying to integrate herself into a community in which she‚Äôs a flagrant trespasser with a jarring accent.\n\nIt‚Äôs by no means the case that all or even most language communities are exclusive or distrustful. But if your second language happens to become advanced enough to form a part of your identity as an individual, be aware that you‚Äôll no longer be dealing with mostly linguistic challenges, but with social-psychological ones that are a part of human nature, which is  far more determinative and powerful than all the reason in the world. \n\nTo avoid the worst part of that smattering of human foibles and prejudices encountered on the road to excellence, the emotional ups and downs of the reactions of those with whom you've share this foreign languge, here‚Äôs my advice: know that you‚Äôre alone from beginning to end, that this is a solitary journey in which you have to pursue your own standards of excellence and attain satisfaction with yourself first and foremost, that you can‚Äôt rely on the external feedback of human nature to know whether you‚Äôve made it or not. Don‚Äôt look for external signs of acceptance and approval, but instead use your own self-satisfaction as a guidepost (perhaps with the help of objective exams, to the degree that that‚Äôs necessary). \n\nAnd the good thing about being an introverted language learner? Well, goddammit, you‚Äôre made to last. Once thought to be a vice in the language-learning game, that solitude has now become a virtue.",

However, in many language videos I watch and in a lot of discussions I hear, people always talk about how the standard language that people learning the language study isn't actually used that much by native speakers. I've heard that this is different for some languages, like anecdotally I've heard standard Italian is more widely spoken, but for languages I'm considering learning like German and especially Arabic, I've always heard that the standard language is much less widely used than local or regional dialect. \n\nI don't really have a goal when it comes to learning a language aside from the enjoyment of learning a language (since I kind of just have to take a language lol), but it would be nice to be able to communicate with other speakers and be able to use the language for travel and such. I wonder how people take what they've learned in the classroom and apply it to the language that people actually speak, or if this isn't really that big of a concern and I'm just overthinking things.

I have emailed them and reported this as an issue as my friend who made an account over a year ago got his account verified in about 3 days, what is going on?

In the previous version which is here  [Repetition practice with Excel, sharing my script. : languagelearning (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/11ca47l/repetition_practice_with_excel_sharing_my_script/) \n\nwe could just select couple of columns and immediately start practicing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut before we start, I need issue a **warning!!!!**\n\n **This development uses VBA script, and you need to be very careful when downloading file with scripts because it potentially could harm your system and Microsoft warns you every time you download like this which is quite reasonable.

Sets are basically play role as tags. You can assign up to 5 sets to each file.\n\n2.

With this option on one more randomization takes place in between sets.\n\n\\- Max per session ‚Äì you can restrict maximum numbers of words. Like with sets it is 100 words, but lets set 20.\n\n\\- Max per set restricts maximum number of words withing every set.  \n\nNote ‚Äì first ‚ÄúMax per set‚Äù applies, then ‚ÄúMax per session‚Äù\n\n\\- Priority weight ‚Äì word that has X in priority column will appear so many times as set here. By default, it is 3. If it is ‚Äì 1 then no prioritization works\n\n\\- Choice selection. For new set of words, it is very useful is practicing choice selection.

I assumed that these magazines existed because most high schools in the united states had a spanish curriculum, but no curriculum for other languages, so Spanish was the only one with a positive ROI from a magazine-publishing perspective.\n\nIn any case, I wondered if anyone knew if similar magazines existed for other languages?   they don't necessarily need to be in print anymore as long as I can find them in PDF format or whatever...  \n\nDoes anybody know of similar magazines that exist for native english speakers trying to branch out into other languages?\n\nThanks!",

I have tried to disassociate this as much from my own personal politics as I can, but just for full transparency I am an English first language speaker who is mostly monolingual with at best an A1 level in one other language. I will provide my own personal list but feel free to disagree with all of it.\n\n1. English: this one is pretty obvious, I hope few will disagree\n2. Arabic: the Arab world is huge and definitely expanding. While I'm aware than there are many different versions of Arabic and not all are mutually intelligible, populations of Arab speaking nations are growing very fast and they will certainly be a major player in the near future\n3. Spanish: Spanish is the most spoken first language in the new world. Not to mention it's use in Europe and Africa. As most New World nations are rather young in their development, Spanish could have an even bigger impact on the world in the future.\n4. French: Due to the colonial past of France, French is widely used in many nations all over the world. I expect it's usage to at least stay the same, if not grow in the coming decades. Especially in Africa.\n5. Russian:  Despite it's relatively low number of speakers, Russian is a language with widespread use across a large portion of the globe. Although I expect its usage to decline in the coming decades, Russian still retains it's spot on this list.\n\n?:   Mandarin: Honestly Mandarin could replace any language on this list other than English. China   \nis growing rapidly as a world power and quite possibly could replace the United States in the   \nnear future\n\nLet me know what you think about this list, and feel free to make changes that accurately reflect your views.",

I'm probably at a C1 or C2 maybe even native level speaker of hindustani. Being Muslim and having dabbled in Fusah Arabi in the past, I also know multiple Arabic words. \n\n\nFor the past 6-7 months I've immersed my self in learning Turkish. I've gotten to around B1/2 in Turkish and can hold semi complex conversations about politics and etc. Learning an language like Turkish has been really mentally challenging and honestly i need a break and want to try learning another language. I have enough Turkish friends in my life who i solely speak to in Turkish and spend at least 2 hours a day talking to. I will also continue taking Turkish lessons and doing anki flash cards but i won't be I'm needing my self in studying the language as i have been. \n\n\nI want to take time to learn a language that's far easier for me to learn in which i don't have to relearn sentence structure grammar and thinking in a massively impactful way like i did with Turkish. If love to get back into Arabic or try Mandarin or Korean, I just am not ready for that commitment. So i wanted to stick to learning languages that \n\nA. I can have access to solid resources \nB. I can interact with people locally in and around my area or in the online spaces im in. \nC. A language from a language family i already know and a language that isn't too distant from a language i already know. \nD. A language that has tons of words i am already familiar with. \n\nI have settled on the following as possible options. \n\nFarsi: a significant amount of Turkish and Hindustani comes from farsi. So much so that after a quick glance at some basic farsi i could probably go to a restaurant and order food. Sure i don't understand any grammar rules or anything but i could look at a sentence understand the words that I'm saying and repeat them. In Houston there are tons of personas and Persian restaurants i can practice at as well. And also i can read Arabic so i would just need to learn a handful more letters to pick up farsi. \n\nFrench: it's French. I'm a native English speaker. Don't need to expand past that. I could play video games on French servers as practice as i have been doing for Turkish. \n\nSpanish: i learned some Spanish in highschool and there's a lot of shared it similar vocab compared to English and surprisingly some common Arabic words that even Hindustani and Turkish speakers use. I live in south Texas so finding people to talk to won't be an issue at all. \n\nIndonesian: every language youtuber ever raves about how easy Indonesian is. The thing is Houston has a massive Indonesian population, many of which I'm close friends with. Finding people to talk to won't be hard at all and i hear it has shared vocab with hindi and Arabic. \n\nKazakh: i know zero cyrillic but i have heard they're switching to Latin is love to learn a language similar to Uyghur and travel to china and speak it. I have learned very basic kazakh like \"Selam Qalaysin, jaqse, men de jaqse\" and stuff like that. A lot of similarities to Turkish and i do have a significant amount of kazakh friends. \n\n\nSo if anyone has had similar language experiences as me does anyone know have suggestions on a good language i can look at or a specific language that may work better for me?",

My point is, before I began learning a language, I saw all of these things as just some slang English and not ‚Äúreal‚Äù words or ways of speaking. \n\nI now realize that my old way of viewing language is simply just wrong.

It‚Äôs going great for 9 months. I can talk to myself in French to do some degree, and I have spoken with some natives on Discord. \n\nHowever, I still really struggle with speaking because of this cursed crippling nervousness that makes me feel I like I forget all of the French that I know. Most of time, I simply keep myself muted and listen to the natives speak. Then there is this word, that word, that grammar structure, adjective placement (basic but I don‚Äôt know when BAGS applies or not), that phrase that makes no sense but does, and the natives speak so fast that it all sounds like familiar nonsense where I can understand only a word here and there. It‚Äôs all so overwhelming. And I don‚Äôt why I can‚Äôt remember those words that I learned whenever I‚Äôm speaking with natives.\n\nPlus, I am not a social butterfly in English, so it‚Äôs real pain trying to start a conversation in French when you feel like speaking is unnecessary. I have heard some people say  something along the lines of ¬´¬†Oh, just drink some alcohol and it‚Äôll come out¬†¬ª. It‚Äôs a load of bull because I‚Äôve tried it, plus I don‚Äôt like the idea of relying on alcohol to give you temporary confidence that‚Äôll fade as you sober up (also extremely unhealthy). \n\nAny advice surrounding tackling nervousness speaking your Target Language.

        "text": "DISCLAIMER: This is merely a hypothesis, but I plan on putting it to the test at the first chance I get. Furthermore, I have experience learning languages, but not using this method.\n\nI came up with this method while travelling in Mexico, after becoming interested in learning Maya, and improving my Spanish through constant communication and interaction.\n\nMany people say that it takes years of learning before you can become fluent in a language. I disagree. Although I also believe that the people who tell you you can learn a language in a week or a month are dishonest. It's important to not have false expectations about language learning; it takes a lot of effort. Additionally, this method isn't going to get you perfect in 6 months, but it will get you to a point where you can have conversations and be able to use your language.\n\nBeing able to regularly practice your target language is invaluable, but what about being entirely immersed in it? If someone made an active decision to rely entirely on their TL (not including in the beginning stage), abstaining from switching to their native language, making it a necessity to learn in order to converse, they'd have no shortage of practice. And given the importance that the language would have on your daily life, you most likely wouldn't struggle for motivation. Imagine that every interaction you have is training not just your language, but the areas of language that are most important in conversation. Of course, this method would neglect various other areas, such as literacy and possibly the ability to communicate in more formal situations, but these are skills that could be honed at your home in the area that speaks your native language - you can learn these the old fashioned way. And of course, you'd most likely have to learn the basics in your own time. But you'd pick it up quick, since opportunities to practice will constantly be surrounding you!\n\nI plan to put this hypothesis to the test, when I am old enough, and when I have the chance. I will travel to a Maya community with broadband in the Yucat√°n, Mexico, where I will spend six months living and learning Yucatec Maya - a language with few resources for learning, and one that is incredibly distant from my own native language (the broadband is so that I can do a job working from home, allowing me to work on the wages of my own country, which are higher than those in Mexico).\n\nSo what exactly would my method entail of?\n\nI would be going into the community, knowing no more than the two phrases and one word I already know ('hello', 'thank you', and 'water'). It would be challenging at the beginning, but tips for greetings and usually basic phrases in any language online are always easy to come by. Even if they're sparse in your own language, you will almost always have some results in one of the languages on Google Translate. For example, if someone wanted to learn an indigenous Indonesian language with few resources in English, and didn't speak any Indonesian, they could use Google Translate to find resources for the basics. If this isn't possible, you may have more difficulty, but if you find someone with a basis in a language you know or have access to a translator for, you may be fine. In my case, I have been to Maya communities before and know that I would easily be able to find speakers of both Maya and Spanish. I could use phrases such as 'how do you say xyz', 'what is this called?', and 'what does xyz mean?' to get a basic foundation in the language. If most speakers of your TL are also proficient in another, more widely used language but you can't speak that, either, you can use translation services, such as the ever-growing Google Translate (which, despite its bad reputation, is very good with the basics). I'll call this stage the lower beginner stage.\n\nOnce you reach the upper beginner stage, you'll notice much quicker progress. You'll be able to interact with people in the language, allowing you to grow your vocabulary and fluency. Keep working on vocabulary and grammar, and be sociable. You will have to work very hard to achieve good results, but anyone can succeed if they put in the effort. Eventually, upon obtaining a larger vocabulary and a greater knowledge of the language, you will reach the next stage, in which you will be able to hold conversations. Well done you!\n\nAfter graduating out of the lower beginner stage, the rest of your six months will just be best spent on improving naturally, and practicing regularly.\n\nAnd there it is! Please, feel free to tell me your thoughts! I would also be interested to hear if anybody has ever attempted something like this from scratch, and if so, please tell me how successful it was.",

I am currently working in a multinational company so I do use English every day, but only for business related topic as I don't live in an English speaking country. That's why when I encounter some words, maybe in articles or in my leisure readings, I sometimes struggle to decide if they are worth learning or not. For example, I just encountered in a novel the word \"shards\". Now, I know exactly what is the Italian translation for \"shards\", as Italian is my native language. I'll never forget such a word in my mothertongue, I just have it. But should I make the effort to remember it in English? I would love to have it \"incorporated\" like I do in Italian, but I also know how hard it is considering it is not at all a word I would use on a daily basis. I hardly think I'll ever use it. And this is applicable for so many words, that may be trivial yet I'd like to learn. What do you think?",

This would be my first face-to-face lesson, and I had no idea what to expect. I helped her with her homework, but she was bored, and it was clear that she wasn't understanding what was taught at school. For example, she was supposed to be familiar with the present simple, present continuous simple, and past tenses, but she doesn't know the difference between the tenses, even the most basic ones.\n\nSo I've decided to take a different path. I'm thinking of making her watch Cambridge Young Learners Pre-A1 videos ([https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/learning-english/parents-and-children/activities-for-children/pre-a1-level/sing-and-learn-at-the-zoo/](https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/learning-english/parents-and-children/activities-for-children/pre-a1-level/sing-and-learn-at-the-zoo/)) and do activities, teaching her the most basic vocabulary and then quizzing her, and playing some speaking games.\n\nIs there any advice, what my approach should be, or sources such as books or videos?\n\nThank you so much.",

Tolkien.\n\nIt's purpose is to facilitate the lecture of the book and to assist in vocabulary build-up.\n\nThe deck is composed of Clozed type cards. You have the definition of the word together with a sentence that contains that word in clozed format.\n\nThe Chapters are organized into subdecks. The number of cards trends down with each chapter because cards with matching entries are ignored at import, to avoid redundancy.\n\nIf people appreciate this deck, \"the 2 towers\" and \"the return of the king\" will not be long on their way.\n\n**The actual deck**: [https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/305445501](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/305445501)",

People say that living in the country of your target language is the best way to learn it but they never really mention how. I guess I am asking if besides practicing with people, are there other ways I can supplement my learning now that I am here? Thank you! Or should I say, Obrigado",
