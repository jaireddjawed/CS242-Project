I’m starting to have a lot of despair about the present and where the future is going. I want to be able to enjoy the present moment and be happy about the current situation that I’m in. I understand that I have to learn to deal with the current decade as it is for the next 7 years so I want to make the most of it despite how shitty it’s been so far. Are there any tips or ideas you guys could give me on how to be more grateful and satisfied with the present moment?",

And I recognized that it was because of my insane screen time usage, mostly Instagram. I hated feeling like that, so I’ve deleted Instagram and I’m hoping that I’ll be more productive with my schoolwork. I realize how much time I wasted on Instagram. It’s so embarrassing because sometimes I’m bored, and go to click on Instagram, and then I realize it isn’t there anymore. Definitely for the better…\n\nBut now I’m feeling bored! My first instinct is to download a dating app again…yeah…I know. Not a very good idea. I guess I just need some advice/motivation to get through the sudden lack of continuous content. What hobbies should I resort to? I’ve had so many throughout the years, but how do I find something that’ll stick?",

I wouldn't say I absolutely loved every single part of myself but it felt like I was getting there and for some days I just felt so good and at peace with everything. But for some time now, I started feeling a little down and it is mainly because I feel a little lonely, romantically speaking, I've never had a boyfriend, only \"situationships\", and I just really want to meet someone and connect with them and know how it feels I guess. I tried dating apps but they are not my thing honestly. And many people say that if you truly love yourself you wouldn't have the need of a partner, but I really do and I don't think it takes away from me learning to love myself. I don't know, all these feelings got me a little confused and I'm not sure what to do.",

He tried to date both of us. \n\nThey’re “best friends” now. She’s rejected him repeatedly over the years of their friendship but he is the classic “Nice guy” that kept trying and getting depressed/lashing out when his efforts were never rewarded with a date or sex. He’d simp for her, caretake for her when she had seizures/depressive episodes. He’d do anything for her because he has been so desperate to be with her, she told me she felt bad for him. I’m pretty sure she’s been leading him on at the same time, and has always tried to force herself to be straight. He harassed me to date him, too, but gave up eventually because I enforced strict boundaries and didn’t lead him on. \n\nHe recently got a 1 bedroom apartment and I heard the other day that she ended up moving into it. He told my sister and my sister passed it onto me. I have been 1 month NC and was doing so well. And I’ve been trying not to obsess all over again. \n\nI know it’s none of my business but I’m wondering if they’re dating now.. if she finally ended up liking him after all these years or if she just moved in for convenience. She has a tendency to use people. He’s a workaholic and she doesn’t work much. I don’t see how that’s gonna work out if they’re not dating or at least if he doesn’t *think* they’re dating. He has jealousy issues and wants to date her, and she’s not into him or into guys, she says.\n\nI know it’s a total waste of energy and not something I should care about, but I feel like shit. I keep thinking of her sleeping with that guy… who she has never even been into. And feeling jealous for some reason. She can’t actually have fallen for this guy at this point right? After 8 years of him trying to manipulate her into dating him? Isn’t that pretty much rape at that point? Idk, can some make me feel better? Lol",

But because there exists a minority that uses conscious effort to successfully drastically change their core values, I want to know how that minority--whose core values changed mid-life or continue to change throughout their adult lives--were able to approach breaking old thought patterns little by little to reach their goals. \n\nFor example, I don't associate my identity with my performance in school. Whether I happen to do well or horribly, I feel the same. I rationalize valuing appearance and ideas in the context of identity because they are undeniably a part of you and irrationalize valuing school and career performance in the same context upon the fact that they are only mass judgments made by other people and are not really a part of you in any way. However, I want my mind to associate my identity and confidence with how well I do in school and eventually in my career because I think that would help me reach conscious goals--and I don't know what action to take.  (In other words, my upbringing did not make me an achievement wh\\*re and I want to become one.)\n\nThere are many other things I want to change but this is probably the most pressing.

I’ve realised that this is more to do with their own egos’ rather than actually caring about what I am upto in life… it’s quite tricky to describe but it’s as if that knowing my life isn’t productive or worthwhile (in their eyes) somehow brings them satisfaction, and makes them feel better about their own life situations. \nI’ve explained to them about my practice in spirituality and my meditation etc. but to them these are just ‘meh’. They hold onto ALOT of judgements about me as a person due to my past struggles with mental health. I know this because they have told me what they think of me. \nMy sister in law is the worst for this and bombards me with lots of questions each time I see her, but doesn’t care to ever ask much more once she has received an answer. \nI’ve been avoiding spending time with family because of these reasons , and I would appreciate some guidance on how best to manage this. \nI’ve tired presence and radical acceptance but then I still have to answer their pointless uninterested questions.. which I can only assume they continue to ask in order to feel better about themselves. Practical advice needed on what answers to give to their questioning",

I have been studying robotics all my life and recently got a job while studying in university that pays extremely well, I will graduate in 2 years. I have been successful all my life however I have no goals or a dream. I have tried various things, such as travelling across Europe, Asia and am currently planning to go to new Zealand but I lack any excitement to even do so. I drink and celebrated every weekend blowing 100s of Euros in clubs and bars yet I have no desire to do so if not prompted or forced by anyone. My friends usually describe me the nonchalant guy, a marshmallow even, I don't know whether that's a good thing ahaha.\n\nNo matter what I do I have no attachment or love for it or infact anyone in general. Matter of fact, I feel no empathy towards anything, Often in situations I fake empathy to seem normal. Even seeing a cat killing a crow infront of me as a 7 year old or the time when I accidently swung my bat and hit a sparrow which was flying low did not make me feel bad, it just happened and I casted it aside. I recently realized I have infact no empathy when all my 3 kittens slipped off the 4th floor and died, people around me clearly panicked and crying, however I just continued my day without a thought. \n\nAnyways, I am a fit guy who is lucky enough to live the best life however I feel like I have been on autopilot for my whole life, which is working however towards nothing that matters to me. **Can someone tell me if I am sick with something or its normal for people to be like me? if not What can be done? Are there other people like me who can relate?** \n\nHave a nice day",

        "text": "Hi!  \n**(Longer post 580 words)**  \nTable of context:  \n**-Intro**  \n**-The Problem**  \n**-The Solution**\n\n**Intro**  \nI am a 23 yo guy who has been drinking energy drinks since I was around 10 yo. I started to drink regularly in my early teens when I began to game. It was not a good weekend if I did not hang out with friends do an all-nighter and play video games.\n\nAt 14 years old I started working and making my own money. This made it a lot easier for me to get a hold of energy drinks. So naturally, I started drinking more of them and playing more video games.\n\n**The Problem**  \nStarting high school I would get good grades, but was really bad at making homework. And procrastinating everything the night before. Every time I said I would study I prioritized video games and youtube videos. Most days I said to myself \"okay, today I am buying two energy drinks and some snacks to study all night\". And because I procrastinated on my homework, I wouldn't actually do it most days.\n\nThis pattern continued through high school and into university. Whenever I thought about the need to study, I would buy energy drinks and snacks and then procrastinate all night to not study. I would also consume energy drinks before sports, In school, at parties, and other times I had the craving.\n\nI have always known that energy drinks were bad for your health, especially in the amounts I was drinking. And whenever my parents told me I was addicted, I rolled my eyes and told them no. I would also hide cans around my room so they did not see my consumption of them. I know now that is a common sign of an addiction.\n\nI was also spending a lot of money on it. Probably around 1000$ a year at its worst. And I was aware of that because I still did when I was tracking all my finances very detailed in sheets.\n\n**So the health part did not make me stop, and the financial point did not make me stop.**\n\n**The Solution**  \nFor the past two years, I have been reading a lot about habits and the psychology behind habits. How to begin one, how to lose one, and how your habits can form your life. It started with the famous book Atomic habits, but it evolved into so many other things.\n\nI started reflecting on different areas of my life with my girlfriend on many of the topics I learned when reading about habits and the psychology behind them.\n\nAnd one day it hit me. Because I was telling myself \"I will buy some energy drinks and snacks, and I will do some studying/work\" and continued to procrastinate instead. I created a bad habit without realizing it. One day I tried to work without the energy drinks and snacks, and guess what... I did not urge to procrastinate.\n\nI had done it so many times throughout my life that it had become a bad habit, without me even realizing it.\n\nmy bad habit was...\n\nWhen I sit down with energy drinks and snacks, I will procrastinate.\n\nWhen I realized this it was so easy to stop drinking energy drinks. I decided to stop drinking them one day. And I have not had one in over 6 months.\n\nI hope you found this useful and can use it.  \nI have personally used it with other bad habits I have created for myself.",

Etc. \n\nSo I think this has culminated to me simply coming across as more of a slacker, not-a-care-in-the-world type even though I very much resent that at this point. \n\nI am sort of proud of my carefree attitude in a way, and I would hate to just completely change who I am simply for others’ approval.

I have tried a lot of strategies to make myself commit to something for the reward, but I just lose interest in the reward which can kill my progress. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, just to make sense for the reader, the type of person I am, even though I don't believe in astrology, my personality type is Libra because I am October born. There are a LOT of successful people who are born in October and had to overcome what I am struggling with, but that is the best way to explain my own self to the readers here without confusing the heck out.\n\nIt is so tiring to feel so indecisive about my own goals even though I feel so clear. \n\nAnyone in this journey here who can relate with me?",

My dad taught me to never touch a cigarette in my life (he recovered from the addiction) My mum quit but now starts smoking again.

I talked to her about it. I argued with her about it. She is always agreeing with me and then does the same thing. I really tried everything. I even called my grand and was like: Granny your daughter is smoking at home and it is driving me nuts. I do not know what should I do. I don't want to smell cigarettes in my house. The only thing she says is that it is her only pleasure. Please help me.",

        "text": "Just now i've decided for myself that i must push myself out of my comfort zone. I am tired of just thinking about \"finding my passions\" and \"becoming an interesting person\". I am actually going to do it from zero\n\nI think the only way that i can fill myself with something and become an interesting and smart person is just try out new things and/or get back to old ones. I been rejecting this for long, but i have no option but try it, and here's how i'm going to do it.\n\nI made myself a list of things i would like to try. I'll spend 2 weeks on each and see what sticks to me. The hobbies vary from just playing games to studying complex topics like history, geography, philosophy and etc, so i have a wide range of options to try. If something will stick to me after 2 weeks, then i'll proceed incorporating them into my daily life. If not, then maybe next time or even never again if I'll hate the thing completely (which I hope won't happen)\n\nMy overall goal is to find out hobbies and interests that spark me internally. All the hobbies/interests i chose and wrote down are the ones i have true interest in or i know that i'll benefit if i try them out. Or i'll just have fun! I am scared now that i won't succeed or waste my time, but hey, it's just my gut being scared of getting out of comfort zone, so i'll do exactly that.\n\nMy first goal is to study history for 2 weeks. I'll start with generally watching videos on youtube and researching topics i'm curious about the most for an hour a day. It's not a hard task, and i'll about to supply myself with interesting content, so it won't be daunting.\n\nI don't care if i won't succeed. i don't care if i won't get things right or waste of time. I care only about just trying the thing now. that's the only important thing from now on.  \n\n\nIf it will be appropriate on this server, i will sometimes post my insights on my progress if i won't forget about existence of this post. Maybe if nobody will be interested in reading this, i don't care. I just gonna share my exp anyways (again, if it doesn't annoy the mods. I'll stop once it does)\n\nWell, wish me luck :D",

My situation is that I am on self improvement journey for almost 2 years now (meditating, gym, eating habits, etc) and I met a girl and we have a thing but we ain’t really in a relationship yet (maybe called situationship). She is very fun and loving but she always has downsides which is a waste of time and won’t contribute to a greater good. In my current state, I really want no distractions and just wants to focus on myself but I really don’t want to hurt this girl. I also thought that it’s always good to have a girl when you are still not on your peak yet so that when you really reach ur peak, you already know her personality unlike when u reached ur peak, that’s the time u pick a girl since their personality will most of the time not be real because they just want something from you. My problem is should I leave this girl and focus on myself and hopefully meet a girl in the future again or just let things stay the same and hope that I won’t get burnt out in trying to maintain balance in both aspects? I really lack masculine presence around me and I always do things on my own. Thanks for the help. :&gt;",

By stuff I mean any piece of media, whether it’s video games, tv shows, movies, books, music, audiobooks, sports, documentaries, etc. This also applies for non-fiction stuff as well (although not as potently as pure fiction). I know I WANT to be able to feel something when consuming these things but I don’t know HOW, or if there even is a how. \n\nI’m currently studying engineering maths in university and am passing all of my courses, I have been working out 5 times a week for the past 4 months straight, and I’ve lost more than half my body weight (80kg) in the past 2-3 years. I am very proud of all of these things but I would genuinely give all of them up if I were able to feel motivation for the things listed above. \n\nI don’t know why I can’t feel anything when it comes to entertainment anymore, and I REALLY struggle to find someone who has this same problem as me (googling only comes up with people with the OPPOSITE problem). Could it be some deep-seeded issue that I just don’t know about? Could I be depressed without even knowing? \n\nEither way, I just want to be able to OBSESS about something, anything really. I have had periods when I have been obsessed (not unhealthy obsession, just pure motivation) with stuff. It recently happened for a week when I was playing Minecraft. I woke up and felt this incredible urge to play and the hours just rolled by. It was glorious. But other than that, I don’t really feel like I get that feeling anymore. That feeling that just came by so easily when I was a kid. \n\nAgain, it seems like I’m one of the few people with this issue. It’s like I have everything that people struggle with under control (health, money, education) but I can’t enjoy life to the fullest still.\n\nWould love some advise, cheers!",

        "text": " \n\n***1% Better***\n\nIn today’s mass media world, we hear of bigtime success stories and transformations, lottery wins, and superhero movies where the protagonist’s life is transformed in an instant. The truth is - life isn't like that. \n\nBehind every big transformation story, there is an accumulation of good habits and sometimes years of incremental improvements. Statistics show that 70% of lottery winners go broke, and one third declare bankruptcy (the result of bad financial habits despite winning big).\n\nMassive success is not the result of massive action - as we often mistakenly think, but rather the result of consistent, tiny, incremental improvements over the long run. At first, the habits we change don’t make any noticeable difference if at all - If we workout for 3 days we’re still out of shape. However, over the long run, the accumulations of these tiny improvements compound into something incredible. Here’s how the math works out:\n\nIf you get 1% better every single day for a year, you will end up more than 37 times better!\n\nConversely, if you become 1% worse every day, you’ll become significantly worse.\n\n1.01 \\^ 365 = 37.78\n\n0.99 \\^ 365 = 0.03\n\nThat's a 3778% improvement over one year!\n\nThis is the result of **the compound effect**. \n\nThe idea is simple; Results are **exponential**, not linear. Looks something like this:\n\nResults\n\nTime \n\nThis graph shown above is the reason the rich only get richer, athletes get even more athletic and success brings more success. It compounds.\n\nThe answer to having all of this is **consistency**. If for example you decide to work out every day. The first 2 weeks may not bring the results you expected - this is where 90% quit. They give up because they rely on results to keep them going.\n\nThis is the difference between the common and the uncommon, the ones who give up and the ones who keep going. Truth is, sometimes even 3 months in you won't be where you want to be. But then 6 months you start seeing a change, 9 months you're already doing things you could not imagine, 12 months in you're a different person. \n\nIt's important to emphasize this - the person who stuck for 12 months did the **exact same** thing the guy who gave in after 2 weeks was doing. There's no dark magic or spells or secret pills, it's very simple. Real transformations are anticlimactic!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/10shoiv/how_to_stop_planning_so_much_and_take_action/",
        "text": "Enough with the planning, you already know what you need to do – you just don’t want to take that first step, that’s legit all it is. You’re here hoping I’ll give you some superficial advice so you can take notes on it and then hop on to something else for even more information on what to do next… Enough.\n\nYou know what to do, you’re just scared to do it. Because what if it doesn’t work out? What if you get it wrong? What if there’s just one more variable you need to plan for, one more book you need to read, one more “how-to” video, one more concept you need to learn. There isn’t.\n\nLook, you can plan, prepare and learn as much as you want, but until you take that first step, you truly don’t know anything. You need to put down everything and commit to just doing the thing and accepting that it won’t be perfect, you’ll look stupid and you’ll probably get it wrong. And that’s okay because now at least you’re doing something rather than hanging out on the sidelines and that’s all that matters.\n\nBefore I got into making TikToks and grew my first ever skateboarding page, I spent way too much time researching how to grow a TikTok. I’m a virgo btw, so you already know, I’m a HUGE planner. I was sucking down content after content, reading pieces of advice on Reddit, coming up with detailed content schedules, but the one most important thing I was skipping out on was making content. \n\nAnd deep down I knew that’s the only thing that mattered. Just making and posting content every day. I didn’t need any video to tell me that. But I was afraid.\n\nWhat if I posted content and no one saw it and I failed? That one question is what pushed me to go on the hunt for more information and to overplan as much as I could. I was looking for that one thing to ensure my success but that blinded me from what actually mattered: good, honest, hard work.\n\nAnd maybe that’s where you’re at right now. You’re not planning so much because you really think there’s more to learn and you’re trying to get ready for it –– you’re planning because you’re afraid of taking that step into the unknown. You’re afraid that it might not work out, so instead you’re procrastinating in a way that makes you feel fake productive.\n\nStop it.\n\nLook, I know it’s scary to put down that book, shut off that video or cut off that podcast about growing self discipline and actually put in the work, but if you want your life to change, it’s something you’ve got to do. The more time you spend planning, the less real experience you get and the longer your life will stay the same and your goals unreached.\n\nWhatever is you want to do, whether it’s starting your fitness journey in something like calisthenics or yoga, writing and self publishing a book, starting a business, learning a new skill –– you’ve got to take that first step and just start. And you might fail and waste your time doing the wrong things before you realize what’s up.\n\nHeck, it took me 8 months of consistent posting with no views on YouTube to realize I needed to learn SEO and improve my thumbnails to get more clicks. Think about that. I posted for 8 months straight and missed the one thing that mattered. Even with the research I’d done beforehand and all the hours spent planning, I didn’t fully grasp the idea of SEO until 8 full months later.\n\nBut I don’t regret a thing because in that time, I took more action towards my goals than ever before. And even though my channel barely grew, /I/ grew. I went from this inexperienced wannabe youtuber with a stiff on camera persona, to someone I actually enjoy watching and that’s something no amount of planing could ever help me acquire.\n\nThat all came from honest, hard work. And now I can take my experience, learn from my mistakes and do better over the next 8 months to see where I go.\n\nA plan didn’t get me here. Action –– even if it was in the “wrong” direction did. You’re not going to get things right the first hundred times around and that’s to be expected. But if you keep taking action, you’ll start to see what’s not working and you’ll learn what you need to do better with that new experience. But you can’t get that knowledge from a plan.\n\nIt’s easy to sit on the sidelines and plot up different points of attack before your next move and for a long time that’s all I did. I’m not saying you can’t do that because plans are important and everyone should have a general plan of action. But when that plan stops you from taking that first step because you’ve gotta know more, more, more… That’s when the problem occurs.\n\nI want to help you take action but first I need you to accept the unknown. I’m telling you, it’s not so scary when you step into it and honestly, it’s only until you enter the unknown and give your eyes the time it needs to adjust that suddenly, you’re full of ideas of how to get from point A to Z that you can actually follow. But that all comes from stepping away from your need to plan and just doing the thing.\n\nHere’s what I want you to do. And trust me when I say it’s gonna seem scary and you’re gonna wanna brush me off because this isn’t the easy advice you wanna hear, but it’s what you need to hear. Whatever that thing is that you’re trying to plan for and get as much information on it as you can –– stop. Right now, figure out the 1-3 most important things that you know for a fact will give you the most progress on that goal. And then just do that.\n\nThats it.\n\nIf you want to build a social media, that might be filming, editing and posting valuable content and that’s it. If you want to lose that stomach fat, it might be running, eating healthy and doing crunches. If you want to learn something new that might be spending time practicing and failing horribly at the skill, but continuing to do it.\n\nWhatever it is, pick your 3 and focus only on doing whatever you chose for one month straight. And here’s the thing, you can still spend time planning and learning as much as you want, but only AFTER you’ve taken action on the 1-3 things you just came up with. I don’t want you to expect any immediate results when you do this either. I just want you to do it for the experience. Because experience changes people and it’s what’ll change you.\n\nExperience shows where you’re lacking, whether or not you’re on the right path and it gives you ideas on how to improve. You can’t get that from a book or a video, you can only get that from real life experience. And yes, this will take time –– so what?\n\nYou do know that planning takes time and 90% of planning is wasted time that could be spent taking action.\n\nWhen David Goggins broke the pull-up record, do you think he broke it because he spent all of his time planning? No, he broke it by thinking about how many pull-ups he needed to do every minute and then he did it. it’s as simple as that.\n\nNo need to research the proper way to do pull-ups, how to increase his stamina, the best foods to eat or supplements to take in preparation–– none of that.\n\nJust how many pull-ups per minute, got the number and did it. And here’s the thing, he failed the first time! But he tried again and got it.\n\nSo it’s okay to fail. But it’s never okay to plan so much that you never start and that’s something I’ve struggled with for so long. It wasn’t until I said enough with the “How to grow a YouTube channel” content and told myself all I’d focus on is writing scripts and filming videos that I stepped into the unknown and found my way through.\n\nAnd it was scary and intimidating , but I felt those emotions and kept going anyway. I’m asking you to do the same.\n\nFigure out the 1-3 most important tasks you can do to take action on your goals and for a month straight, do them. At the end of the month, check your progress. If you’re not getting anywhere, ask how can you get better and revise the 3 most important tasks if you need to. Then commit to getting better and try again. \n\nThat’s 10x more effective than never putting your foot in the water because you’re too busy calculating the optimal time and temperature to get in. There is none! Just jump in and swing your arms. That’s it.\n\nNow remember, time is passing anyway. So you might as well start taking action, working on your goals, right now.",

I was like this for about 3-4 years and felt like I’d finally was starting to become the person I’d always wanted to be, had the body I always dreamt of and more importantly I was proud of who I was and what I accomplished everyday. I was especially proud because growing up I started drinking, clubbing and doing drugs from a pretty young age and always struggled with depression and hated my body. Now these feelings are starting to come back after a pretty bad injury I had 5-6 months ago that made it difficult to keep up my exercise habits on top of moving countries alone and the identity change of finishing university. After my exercise habits started to deteriorate everything else kind of started to follow. Some days I can get myself to go to the gym and have productive days and others I’ll be stuck in bed binge eating unhealthy foods for a few days at a time. I don’t wanna be stuck in this victim mindset anymore and want to move on but i’m struggling on how.

This extends to my last relationship, which I should have cut off way earlier (not because he was a bad person, but because we had different ideas of what a relationship entailed, and he felt entitled to more access and power over me than I felt comfortable with) as well as often my friendships and particularly my professional relationships. I'm pretty young (18), so it's normal to be intimidated by authority, but I find myself getting anxious and sick at the thought of even inconveniencing someone slightly. While I think this comes from a fundamentally good place (my parents always emphasised the importance of making things easier for people and being agreeable, and I think those are good qualities to a certain extent), I don't think it's realistic to expect myself to go through life without making a mistake or needing extra accommodation, and I also don't think it's fair to beat myself or others up for needing help.

In Jungian terms, dad was a Ruler, mom was a Caregiver -- textbook, even in their respective career choices (military and medicine).\n\nDad wanted to solve everything with truculence, even when truculence wasn't needed. Mom wanted to solve everything by avoiding conflict, even when conflict was definitely much needed.\n\nI learned very early on: either you abuse or you're abused.\n\nNeedless to say, my problem solving skills are now severely impaired.\n\nEven though I have completely cut ties with my father and loathe all that he is and represents, I still find myself being just like him: angry, violent, intolerant. Except, he was somewhat 'functional', or he got away with or got praise for it because his job requires some level of aggression, I suppose.\n\nBut for me, a 29 year old female developer, it's all just rage, anxiety, isolation, hysteria... I come into conflict with everyone I meet in my daily life. Even when I do not start conflict, I still never have pleasant interactions. I sometimes have to keep myself in check and make an effort to say at least one nice thing, because I've been told that I am a very negative person. I trust no one and I always assume people are being dishonest. Even subconsciously, I feel like I give off a bad vibe, and people pick up on that and treat me unkindly too. Granted, I am going through a sh-tty situation right now and a lot of my frustration is justified. But it manifests in such furious hostile ways that I always end up alienating people who would otherwise be supportive or empathetic. So, even when in the right, I tend to lose everyone's support.\n\nMy biggest goal for myself is to become a person who is light, positive, friendly and makes others feel comfortable around them.\n\nI do not even know if it's possible because I do not know if I ever was that person, but I do know that with my upbringing I was never given the change to actually become that person.\n\nBut now that I am an adult I can parent and give myself the chance to be a better person with better problem solving skills.\n\nIn the meantime, I sincerely apologize to everyone unlucky enough to have crossed paths with this ugly, rude version of myself I so deeply want to leave behind.",

I’m sure you guys know what I mean…\n\nI carry this burden of intense self hatred every day, everything I do is just washed away with “I hate myself, I hate everything, etc etc”. I have cut off most of my friends because I just don’t see the point and I’m overwhelmed by invasive thoughts about how everyone hates me and is better off without me anyway. \n\nI genuinely need your advice.. People legitimately all think of me as stupid, everyone knows I have a learning disability in my life, at work I’m either mocked or infantilised. How could this be? How could this be the person in life I’ve been assigned to be? I feel so disgusted with myself, literally like I’m some sort of ogre or monster. I just want to be alone where I can’t embarrass myself.\n\nHow do I move forward? Do you have any advice on how to overcome the feelings self hatred? I feel like I’m so worthless and I’m just so down.☹️",

        "text": "This is a personal post but I'm sure people have been in this boat before. \nHave you ever felt so much hatred for the world and everything associated yet with no fathomable reason to pinpoint your rage? The person walking slowly in front of you, someone beeping their horn, people glaring judgy eyes at you, the rudeness of the humans you encounter, focusing and replaying certain bad moments you've had with people and thinking everyone's the same, I've come to realise it's associated with jealousy, no one is judging you besides you, it's jealousy in a way that's not very understandable, the boredom of oneself, you're sick of yourself and it projects onto your surroundings but how do you cope? You're not just bored but you're isolated and you isolate yourself, you wish to be someone else in a way that you become jealous of all around you, why am I so fucking annoying, why do I over analyse, why can't I be confident and go up to people and become friends how others do, why am I so mentally alone yet never alone, I feel narcissistic but how can I be when I hate myself, I am embarrassed by myself and jealous because I want to be something more, someone... more.   \nIf there's anyone who's suffered from this type of hatred before, please help me, I'm on a sinking ship and any advice would help, I figured out the cause but I don't know what to do about it now.",

        "text": "title might sound confusing, so let me explain.\n\n\ni am considering being homeschooled. chances are, i'd end up having to educate myself which honestly i think i'd prefer as long as i'm able to get the things i need, like books and stuff. i'm physically not able to attend school much. i'm at 41% attendance now. my school is also not a safe place for me, the school is very bad, so i'm probably not going to stay there anyway.\n\n\nschool drains me too much for me to do both (school and my own learning) at the same time. it takes me days to recover from just being woken up. my body forces me to stay asleep until i wake up naturally for days after, usually when school has finished. my overall health is just very bad and school is the main thing worsening it. the fatigue and brain fog i have from the sleep deprivation caused by having to wake up early is unreal. \n\n\ni want to be able to sleep and sleep as long as i need to so i can actually function and then, when i feel better, i want to learn the core three subjects – maths, english, science – and then just learn whatever i want alongside that. i think i'd try analysing everything i watch and read too. it just sounds fun.\n\n\ni just really *really* want to learn a bunch of stuff. whenever i see something interesting, i want to learn about it. i want to go down a rabbit hole of researching random cool stuff, like philosophies and how dreams work and why we need to dream in the first place. i want to know whatever i find interesting but i can't do that when i'm averaging like 4 hours of sleep per night and can't get anything to help with that. i'm too tired. it feels like i'm shutting down. it's beyond frustrating.\n\n\ni want to learn stuff like ethical hacking, psychology, how the government works, biology, history, media, basic first aid stuff, art and literally anything i find remotely interesting on top of maths, english and science. i want to learn most if not all of the time, but all of the time i am way too tired because i'm not allowed to sleep because i am woken up to go to a school where i am too tired to even learn anything there because my body decided to add 'nocturnal' to the list of problems as if it wasn't long enough already.\n\n\nif i did do this – learn maths, english and science and whatever else on top – would that be a good idea? i know it likely depends on what i'm going to do with my life, but just in general is it a good or bad idea? i don't know what job i want yet, all i know is i'm 100% doing nightshifts.\n\n\ni'm in year 11, btw. that probably matters a lot. i might also get to do my gcses at a later date. i was just wondering since i'm off school for some time now since nobody trusts the school to keep me safe from my fainting prone body and this may be my opportunity to try convincing people to let me teach myself, learn from home, etc. \n\n\n(sorry in advance if i don't reply quick, assuming anyone replies. i'm going to sleep right after i post this – it's 2am, i've slept less than 4 hours, i'm probably going to sleep for 14 hours now lol)",
