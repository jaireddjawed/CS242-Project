It's visually impressive but there isn't any nuance to it besides it being a rehash of the original Top Gun plot. 2022 gave us two Navy military fighter movies. Maverick and the much more emotional and captivating, Devotion.\n\nDevotion far exceeded Maverick with its story, themes, and characters. It also is a beautiful film with epic shots in a historical setting. \n\nSet in the Korean War, Devotion tells the story of Jesse Brown and his plight to succeed and serve as a Naval Aviator. Unfortunately, he bears the ultimate sacrifice. His story is left to inspire Americans of all walks of life to aim high and never give up. \n\nThe focus of Devotion is Jesse Brown's struggle to execute his mission and how it relates to his identity as a Naval Aviator. The racial integration of African-Americans within the Naval Aviation service leaves him weary but hungry to preform, aid his fellow pilots and to provide for his family. The amount of pressure he felt is communicated excellently thanks to Jonathan Majors performance. \n\nJonathan Majors and cast do a fantastic job portraying the development of a cohesive team than the cookie cutter cast of Maverick.\n\nThere are tropes intertwined such as the cartoonish Marines rubbing shoulders with pilots, but Devotion doesn't ham it nearly as bad as Maverick's wannabe Top Gun pilots, bar parties or cheesy one liners. It's just so cringe at times.  \n\nAnyone else feel this way? Anyone disagree? Both films are fine, I just really felt an emotional impact after finishing Deovtion compared to Maverick. Thanks for reading this far if you did.",

I always knew Rocky and what not, but I never cared for the franchise. However, Ive been really into a lot of the trailers and TV spots for Creed 3, so I decided to watch all predecessors. I watched them all in between today and two days ago. In terms of the Rocky films, I like all of them except for 4 and 5, mainly 5. I prefer 1 and 3 over 2, but Im stuck between which I prefer. I also really liked Rocky Balboa. I think I prefer that over Rocky 3 to be honest. In terms of the Creed films, I liked both of them. I think I prefer Creed 2. In short, here's my ranking for the Rocky Films. I'm not putting them with Creed because that would be a really tough decision for me.\n\n-Rocky\n-Rocky Balboa\n-Rocky 3\n-Rocky 2\n-Rocky 4\n-Rocky 5\n\nAs I said, I prefer Rocky Balboa over 3, but Im stuck between 1 and 3.

        "text": "Basically, &gt;!a fat guy walks 8 ft and FUCKING DIES!&lt; . I just saw this movie yesterday and I can't help but think it reinforces the stereotypes the general audience have on fat people. It's downright degrading and incredibly shallow on the message it tries so hard to convey.\n\nBut that's not the only issue I have with it: the use of shock value as a device for generating empathy on the audience, the fact that most of the characters (if mot all) feel overacted and clich√© (except for Brendan Fraser's which I think it was superb as he did everything he could to elevate his character, Charlie), the writing feels amateurish and the dialogues (especially from Ellie) don't feel authentic at all (I read somewhere else that the writing ressembles a Wattpad novel and I just think it's spot on), the characters have ZERO real developement (wtf was the deal with &gt;!the pizza guy, Dan?? That people is nice to other people as long as they're not morbidly obese and THAT'S IT??!&lt; )\n\nThe ending could have been beautiful, and I swear I would've shed a tear since the cinematogeaphy, acting and music were all put together so beautifully until the credits rolled. But everything that preceded it was just so wrong on so many levels I could not help but feel it as a cheap way to generate catharsis on the viewers.\n\nI have so many more issues with the movie but I'd like to read some opinions from you guys. Did you like the movie from start to finish? Did you have some issues with the way it portrayed Charlie? Did you feel the acting and writing ressembled the way people act and communicate in real life?",
