Not a push over. \n\nFresh out of training at a bank call center. I received a call right around the end of my shift. It's an elderly lady who is having a dispute credit reversed. She's on a fixed income ect.\n\n So she starts talking about how bills are so expensive and her rent is over $1000. Trying to help her, she is rambling on about how times have changed and \"certain types of people\" are all the cause of her bad situation. I can't believe she actually said this and would NOT stop talking about \"these people\"\n\nI wanted to throw a \"Yeah criminals due tend to cause crime, no matter what they are.\" but I kept it together and ended the 45 min call. I have an email saying that I need to meet with my supervisor.\n\nSo in my meeting, I am told that I am too nice to customers and brought this upon myself.\nIt's great having a equal opportunity name that doesn't denote my race so yeah... Victim blaming? ",

        "text": "Hey,\n\nTL;DR: Rep wants to audit the faults us techies have already audited and deems every one of them false positive.\n\nIm chiming in all the way from New Zealand, We serve Australian and local customers in the transport sector. We have a telemetry product that also meters distance for road user charging on top of reporting. The devices are connected to the vehicle ignition, speed pulse output for calibration, power and 3 other possible sensors. Frequently a fuse or solder will fail due to the nature of the roads these vehicles work on rough terrain and shit workmanship from the installers. We will email our customers when we identify an issue with the wiring or operation. These are legal compliance devices so it needs to be taken seriously. If these are in fault you will be fined.\n\n&gt;Being in the transport sector you are already dealing with impatient snobs who think everything revolves around their fleet and these are small issues that do not matter.\n\nWe have a very large customer, 2000+ active units with us, Due to the fleet size and the spread across the nation it is not possible for us support people to know what area we need to notify of fault. So for this customer the sales rep took it upon himself to redirect all faults to the correct region! Excellent! \n\nIt has been a few months since this has been the case and a lot of this customers faults are reaching the \"non responsive\" stage, (3 attempts to contact no reply) and receiving a LOT of backlash from their administrators for faults. So I look further into it to find this rep is ignoring all the emails that we are sending. (Trust me when say tech support only email you for things that require immediate action that affects compliance.) \n\nSo I email their administrator with the rep CC'd in for the first time ever. Instant reply from the administrator with relevant details. Queue angry fucking sales rep cause we undercut him.\n\nStarring Myself, Manager and Rep.\n\n&gt;Rep: Once again I have to make it clear that system &gt;generated faults go to me and not ______.\n&gt;There should be notes in the system to that effect.\n&gt;Can we please let all know?\n\nI go to my manager with a big grin on my face and say \"Guess what\" He actually replied for once, To my managers dismay he asked, What fault type was it? I advised what was said 2 paragraphs above.\n\nManager:\n&gt;Support do know but when we do not get a response from you (/u/FinerSire) has supplied 6 examples of this himself) we do whatever we can to get the information. In this case he has copied her in straight away which he should not have done but as I have said we need responses especially when it is a blue light fault and if we have to wait days for a response (if we get one) this could result in the customer getting an infringement and Support coping the flack because we did nothing about it. And believe me this happens quite often. We waste enough time chasing customers and techs for responses, hence the reason we introduced the non responsive process, which we are not doing for _______ by the way as this would look pretty bad if we emailed out to a client admin in _______ that we have had no response given you are the contact.\n\nQueue the Champagne, we just rekt the sales rep! But nooooo, He has to know better than what we do. \n\nRep replied with the opening line, Bollocks! \nGoes on to justify why he is the support contact (Yes because its a national company with many offices and fleets) and then he tries to justify his role in this faulting process.\nRep:\n&gt;The reason they come to me first is that in the majority of cases it is a problem with a truck towing a trailer that does doesnâ€™t have pin 5 livened up or there is a problem with the plug and what has happened in the past is that a tech is sent out to visit nothing and ______ pay a bill for nought. A response is sent through when action is needed in regard to what may be a genuine fault. \n\nSo you are telling me an issue with ignition feeds, speed pulses, units not reporting are due to a truck towing a trailer and not being powered up? Rightt... (Keeping in mind the fault at hand was a speed pulse fault on a truck.)\n\n&gt;Notifications we send through to _____ are taken to mean exactly what we state in the system generated email and they are left with no recourse but to request a visit from a Technician in each and every case. _____ process is (Org's Admin) receives the notification and returns contact details and then that person is told there is a fault and they are then required to ask for it to be rectified as per the case in point.\nIf you would like to provide justification for every visit for your non responsive process on a monthly basis please fill your boots.\n\nThis rep is trying to lay down the law on us support peeps and my manager, All we do is fix compliance issues. Currently the emails sitting with my manager and the national sales manager. This is gonna be a good one and I'll update when relevant.\n\nHere is what we send out for a fault: https://imgur.com/a/bhodR\n\n",

        "text": "Airline guy...  \n\nSo there's a phenomenon here all of a sudden it seems since there's no jurisdiction regarding \"emotional support\" and \"special assistance\" animals on carriers in the us. Basically you can pay a couple bucks and get a fake document and amazon prime an animal vest and claim that you are protected under the disabilities act that voids you from paying for a pet on a flight. There no resources to go after these people because nothing has been allocated to really deal with these liars. So we don't really care unless they get caught in a lie, then it's just tough titty.\n\nSo what we do is give them the benefit of the doubt if they can call in and let us know ahead of time and send in their documentation or you get charged at the airport. Simple as that. Or so I thought\n\n\n&gt;yes I need to speak with someone from your emotional support animal line\n\n&gt;**ok absolutely is this in regards to your flight on the 31st**\n\n&gt;yes \n\n&gt;**ok all that we need is your support animal verification forms you can fax those or arrive to the airport with them**\n\n&gt;excuse me?????\n\n&gt;**we verify your documents prior to travel, send them in and we will get you and your support pet take care of**\n\n&gt;EXCUSE ME it is NOT a PET it is a support animal\n\n&gt;**. . .**\n\n&gt;HELLO\n\n&gt;**of course, so I can set this up for you would you like our fax?**\n\n&gt;I never have to send anything in to other airlines I just call and you add it each time.\n\n&gt;**im afraid that we may do things a little differently from other airlines in that respect we do need the documents sent to us**\n\n&gt;I DONT HAVE DOCUMENTS THATS WHAT YOU ARENT UNDERSTANDING\n\n&gt;**maam in that case we would charge a fee to travel with a pet**\n\n&gt;EXCUSE ME. You just said it again, it is not a pet\n\n(At this point I'm amused at how she centers the discussion about my choice of words which apply to her situation and not the blaring fact that she has no documentation to send in as proof that she in fact has a support animal)\n\n&gt;**maam, you are traveling with a pet in the eyes of our policies if you dont go through the appropriate channels to receive the paperwork for your support ANIMAL**\n\n&gt;we will see about that *CLICK*\n\n\nI flagged her reservation for a callback from our disabilities department. They're going to prohibit her travel with an animal on the day of without the forms, or she's going to cough up the pet transportation fee. \n\n\nTLDR: lady demands her support pet be treated with respect, unable to send in documents for classification because she never obtained forms. Refuses to pay for pet at the airport. Hangs up.\n\n\nWhat is an emotional support animal supposed to assist with in the event of an emergency anyway...",

We don't use Access or anything similar to keep track of our volunteers because we're cheap like that.  Our scheduling software is web-based and was coded in house when we first started 16 years ago.  \n\nSo I get a call from a man I'll call The Interruptor^TM .  So The Interruptor^TM calls and says he'll be late for his 2-5 shift .  Okay, fine, I ask for his name so I can tell my colleagues not to assign his shift to anyone if he's more than 30 minutes late.  I look on the schedule and the following conversation happens:\n\n&gt;capn_morgans_revenge: I'm sorry, Sir, I'm not finding you on the afternoon schedule--\n\n&gt;The Interruptor^TM : Oh, well it better be there!  Last time I tried to volunteer with you people, someone mis-scheduled me and I came all the way out from work for nothing!  Blah blah blah...\n\n&gt;CMR: I'm sorry to hear that, Sir, sometimes our front desk staff make mistakes.  If you want, I can look up your volunteer ID number--\n\n&gt;TI: You can look, but it won't be there [on the morning schedule].  It's [number].\n\nI look, and sure enough, he was scheduled to be there that morning at 10.\n\n&gt;CMR: So I do see that there was a shift for this morning at--\n\n&gt;TI: See, that's impossible!  I work graveyard until 2, why would I schedule something for when I'm working???\n\n&gt;CMR: I don't know, Sir, I can only see what was put on the schedule--\n\n&gt;TI: So you're telling me that I took off early from work, walked four miles from the bus stop, and am now coming all the way from [far away], just for you to tell me I can't volunteer today?\n\n&gt;CMR: I'm sorry, Sir, it does look that way--\n\n&gt;TI: Look, you guys are pretty chill there, can't you just find some work for me to do for my last two hours before I get my computer?  I need this computer for my kid's school so she can do school work!\n\n&gt;CMR (At this point I was genuinely going to try to find him something to do around the building, cleaning or something, especially since he was coming from so far and we already screwed up once): Well if you want I can--\n\n&gt;TI: Look, I'm really trying not to get upset, because I know it's personally not your fault, but I'm pretty pissed!  I missed out on income and walked several miles to get to a bus to come to you! (He's probably exaggerating; the area he was coming from has like half a dozen bus lines running through it).\n\n&gt;CMR: I understand your frustration, Sir--\n\n&gt;TI: Look, can I just talk to your boss?  If your boss tells me I can't volunteer today, then that's fine, you'll never hear from me again, you can take the computer and spit on it for all I care!\n\n&gt;CMR: I'm sorry you feel that way, Sir.  Please hold while I transfer you.\n\nEither I screwed up transferring him, he hung up before my supervisor could answer, or she told him something he didn't want to hear, because within the next fifteen minutes we got probably a dozen hang up calls, presumably from him.  We'd answer, we'd hear some shuffling of the phone, and he'd hang up.  Just being petty and childish.",

        "text": "I just need to talk about it somewhere. Here's a collection of stories. So I work at a call center for a hotel chain. I'm in rewards, but I also can do basic reservations and customer care, though I pass it on if it's complicated. \n\nThe hurricane is... heart breaking. They've been offering major overtime benefits to convince us to stay but oh my god guys. I keep getting desperate people who need a safe place to stay and we... we have none. There's nothing left. We're booked out. And I keep getting calls like that followed by these... selfish assholes. \n\nStory 1\n\nI had a guy yesterday, right before Irma hit. He left his sunglasses in a florida hotel a few days ago and wants them back. I told him the might have evacuated but I'll check, and he starts getting testy cause \"hotels don't close.\" Turns out, they're still open just on a backup generator. \n\nSo I call, and the front desk informs me housekeeping covers lost and found, but they've left for the day to prep for Irma. Even if anyone else had a key, they're trying to prep the hotel for damage and can't go check anyway. They take a message with his name, number, and description of the sunglasses and promise to call him back if they still have power and phones tomorrow. \n\nLet me tell you guys, this was not enough for DouchbagMcSunglasses. They obviously must have stolen or lost his sunglasses and are hiding that fact. What kind of compensation can he receive if they lost them. I directed him to customer care and he let it go but how friggen petty. How dare their top concern be a hurricane and not his stupid sunglasses?\n\nStory 2\n\nThis one is shorter. This guy calls in because he had a gym membership at one of our hotels in the virgin isles. The hotel lost 4 floors in the hurricane. He wants to know when they'll be open again, cause his second home is there and he wants to use the gym when he goes again. They don't even have power right now. He then demanded that we don't charge him. Super fair request but.... It's not exactly ours. It's one of those situations where they're an independent business housed in our hotel. I gave him their phone and email, and his response?\n\"yeah, I know. They told me before that you don't own them. They just aren't answering and I wanna know right now.\"\n\nDude. Fuck off. \n\nStory 3\n\nSo this one didn't happen to me, but my coworker. This dude is looking at our most expensive, fanciest Vegas hotel. It's hella expensive. Like over 500 expensive. \n\nGuest: aren't you doing anything for hurricane survivors?\n\nCoworker: we are but sir. You aren't in the hurricane. \n\nG: yeah but my second home is there. I got damaged by it too. You owe me this room free, because I'm a hurricane survivor.\n\nMy coworker essentially just kept repeating no until he went away but seriously. What a dick. \n\nSo those are the three main stories that pissed me off. \n\nEDIT: Story 4\nMy coworker got another doozy and I had to post it. This is her second hand story of it but oh my god. Cuntomer of the day award.\n\nThis lady calls in, she is the second highest status with us. Usually, you have to stay a LOT of nights for that, but she got it in a different way that's hard to explain. \n\nNow, this lady is actually in Florida. Her house is intact, dry, but does not have power. She's looking for a hotel with air conditioning. Of course we have no availability. \n\nGuys. She ASKED MY COWORKER TO KICK SOMEONE OUT so she could have fucking air conditioning. Gave zero fucks about whether or not that person even had a home left. She needs air conditioning so her needs win. \n\nMy faith in humanity is destroyed.",

Duties include floorwalking, taking over escalated calls and working with customer complaints.\n\nSaturday we close at 6pm, at 5:50pm an agent approaches me and explains customer wishes to complain about a charge on his account and wont get off the call till he speaks to someone higher, so I go log into my phone and the agent transfers the customer across to me,\n\nMe: Hello, is that Mr X?\n\nX: *Sigh* yes it is, and who are you now?\n\nMr: My name is Y, Mr X my colleague just told you they were putting you over to me as you wanted to complain?\nX: No they didn't!\n\n(I'm sitting next to the agent and literally heard them tell him)\n\nMe: So, I was told you have a complaint regarding a charge on your bill of Â£60? All customers are made aware of this charge if they wish to leave before their contracted term is up.\n\nX: shouts and screams usual nonsense about not signing any contract, for about 5 minutes.\n\nNo but what my actual complaint is the fact that your company has entered my name wrong! That's not very professional is it?\n\n(his name was missing capital letters in his forename and surname, thats all)\n\nHe continues this for another 5 minutes or so until he demands compensation for the stress and the upset this has caused as he's just moved and moving is very stressful, and his wife is bedridden.\n\nas a rule, for poor customer service the most we ever give out is Â£20 and is usually a credit off their balance. Oh he didn't like that\n\nMr X: 20 f****ing pounds for all this hassle? I want at least Â£100! (coincidentally including his termination charge this is what his balance works out at).\n\nI told him no, and the most we would give him was Â£30 and an apology letter, which he accepted.\n\nHe later called up about a month later claiming he did not accept this and I said he could have the Â£100. Supervisor listened to the call and heard he agreed to my offer of Â£30...and still gave the guy an extra Â£50...\n\n\nTLDR; Customer's name was missing capital letters and got Â£80  worth of compensation.\n\nEDIT: formatting",

How can I help you?\n\nPatient: Yeah I need to schedule with Dr. Soandso\n\nMe: Sure let's get your chart up [verifies chart details] So you're a new patient, correct?\n\nPatient: yeah \n\nMe: were you looking to see her at the A clinic or the B clinic? \n\nPatient: I don't know. Isn't that your job to know?\n\nMe: Seeing as how you're a new patient, no I don't know. Do you have [condition that would have be appoint in clinic A?]\n\nPatient: No I have adrenal fatigue and high blood pressure. \n\nMe: Ah okay so probably clinic B then. Let me take a quick look at my instructions. \n\n[I put patient on hold and check new patient instructions. It says Dr. Soandso is accepting new patients but my new patient instructions only allow me to appoint with 3 doctors, none of them are Dr. Soandso. I call helpline. They tell me to offer the other providers but if she wants to see dr. Soandso to do a self referral and message the clinic about the discrepancy and tell the patient the clinic will call her to schedule. ]\n\nMe: Thank you for holding. It looks like my instructions only allow me to appoint you with Drs. A, B, or C. I can certainly appoint you with one of those now or if you'd like to see Dr. Soandso I'll send over a self referral and the clinic will be in touch on Monday to schedule you. \n\nPatient: Why is this so damn hard? Just give me an appointment with Dr. Soandso! I shouldn't have to jump through these hoops!\n\nMe: I'm sorry about that patient. In that case I'll have to put in a self referral for you and have the clinic call you. \n\nPatient: No no no! I don't want to deal with all this! \n\nMe: Would you prefer to be appointed with Dr. A, B, or C?\n\nPatient: No! I want to see the person I chose! Not someone picked for me! \n\nMe: I'm sorry but the only way to do that then is the self referral route. \n\nPatient: Fine. But will I need to have my doctor out in a referral? That's such a pain! \n\nMe: No, patient. I'll be putting in a self referral. The clinic will call you to schedule. \n\nPatient: you know what? Just give me an appointment with Dr. A. \n\nMe: sure just a moment. \n\n[I pull up Dr. A's schedule. He's scheduled out. I have no appointments to give her.]\n\nMe: It looks like dr. A is scheduled out and doesn't have any appointments right now. Would you like me to check Dr. B and C as well?\n\nPatient: No! Why the hell cant you get me an appointment?\n\nMe: Patient, dr. A is scheduled out. He has no appointments for me to give you. If you don't want me to check dr. B or C then it might be best to stick to the original plan and I can self refer you to Dr. Soandso. \n\nPatient: If we do that I need to know right now if I will need a referral from my doctor! None of this wishy washy bullshit. \n\nMe: As I said before, if we self refer you, you won't need a doctor's referral. \n\nPatient: Fine do that I guess. Can you make an appointment with Dr.  Bob Whatshisface in digestive health?\n\nMe: I can certainly look into that. \n\n[I pull up one of the gastroenterology clinics and check the providers. No doctors by that name (name changed obviously but doctor's name is super common). I pull up my large list of providers at all the clinics. One Dr. Bob Whatshisface but in another speciality.] \n\nMe: Patient, I see a Dr. Bob Whatshisface but he's a hematology oncologist, not a digestive health provider. I'm pretty sure that's not the same one. \n\nPatient: What do you means it's not the same one? His name is Dr. Bob Whatshisface isn't it?!?\n\nMe: Yes but you said you need a digestive health specialist. That's not his specialty and he has a common name. There could be hundreds of Dr. Bob Whatshisfaces in this state. Are you sure he was with this medical center?\n\nPatient: I'm sure! Just get me appointment anyway!\n\nMe: Do you have cancer or a blood condition?\n\nPatient: No didn't you hear me? I have a adrenal fatigue!\n\nMe: Ma'am I can't get you an appointment with a hematology oncologist if you don't have cancer or a blood condition. This Dr. Whatshisface is not the same one you're referring to. \n\nPatient: You are a useless idiot! I'm going to call back to talk to someone who knows what the fuck they're doing!\n\n[click]",

Very apologetic, pays the bill, we reactivate service and they are on their way. \n2. Customer is a foaming at the mouth asshole, claims either they did pay us, or we're overcharging them, or the service sucks so WHY SHOULD I PAY FOR IT? Etc. \n\nThis was one of those calls...\n\nMe: Thanks for calling this is LilacPenny how can I help you?\n\nCustomer: Yeah I wanna know why you shut off my internet after I just paid *you people* 200 fucking dollars. \n\nMe: I'm so sorry to hear that, can I get your phone number so I can pull up your account and look into it?\n\nC: *proceeds to give me 6 different numbers until we find the one on her account*\n\nMe: (after verification lasting 10 minutes into the call) Great thanks, would you like to update your phone number so we can find your account faster the next time you call? \n\nC: NO!!!\n\nMe: (internally: whyyyy) Ok, so I'm just going to have to put you on hold for a couple minutes while I go over your account and see what's going on. \n\nC: *heavy sigh* \n\nSo upon reviewing this woman's account I can see that she signed up in May and has NEVER made a payment, other than this $200 payment that came in yesterday. This account should have been disconnected months ago and fell through the cracks. Customer is on a pkg she obviously can't afford and goes over her data half way through the month and has overage fees on every single bill. \n\nMe: Thanks for holding, so after review I can see that your total balance before the $200 payment was $1000 and that was also the first payment we've ever received from you. In order for us to turn your services back on we need at least 50% of the total balance, after the $200 payment that would be an additional $300. \n\nC: BUT I JUST FUCKING PAID YOU!!!!\n\nMe: You owed $1000 though and you only paid $200...\n\n(These same 2 sentences were literally repeated back and forth 5 more times)\n\nC: Well your service sucks anyway why should I pay for it! I'm on a fixed income and I only get 1 cheque a month from my child tax credit and I use that to pay all my bills how do you expect me to live now my kids can't watch Netflix anymore you took that away from my kids!!!!!!\n\nWhere to even begin...  \nMaybe you shouldn't have something you can't afford? Maybe you should have called us to lower your package or set up a payment plan? Maybe your kids could read or go outside until you get your shit together? Maybe you should use your child tax credit to buy them some books and not to pay YOUR bills? Maybe if your service is so bad you could have called us to troubleshoot? Maybe get a fucking job??? But I digress...\n\nMe: I'm sorry to hear that, but there is nothing we can do until we receive at least a $300 payment, after that we can send out a technician to troubleshoot your service and lower you to a more affordable package if you like. \n\nC: You guys are a bunch of fucking scam artists just cancel my fucking account. (Coming from the person who's been using a service for 4 months and never once paid for it)\n\nMe: I can certainly set up a cancellation for you, however you are 4 months into a 2 year term so you would have to pay our maximum cancellation penalty of $300\n\nC: ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME YOU STUPID FUCKING BITCH I DID NOT SIGN A FUCKING CONTRACT I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR FUCKING BOSS RIGHT NOW YOU FUCKING LIAR\n\nMe: (all my nice customer service shit is officially OVER once you start getting personal)  You definitely DID sign a contract on xx/xx/xxxx, I have a scanned copy of your signature on my screen right now. If you would LIKE to speak with a supervisor I can get one for you but I'm going to ask you to keep it professional going forward or I will have to disconnect the call. I can also tell you the supervisor is going to tell you exactly what I have. \n\nC: You WILL get me a fucking supervisor immediately you little fucking -CLICK \n\nand I hung up on her. I can't stand deadbeat customers who have the balls to call in screaming about being cut off when YOU'VE NEVER PAID US A DIME. ",

You can't have it both ways. If you decide to change your care then your old doctor can't refill your meds.

BLAH BLAH BLAH (no, she didn't actually say that, ultimately what she did was cut me off to talk in really fast Spanish to the customer)\n\n&gt;Cx: Como?\n\nI'm confused as it is because I don't know Spanish, but from the expression of the Cx, she seemed really confused. \n\nBasically, what ended up going down was this: The Interpreter and the Customer started yelling and cutting eachother off in Spanish while I had to sit back and hear the whole thing. \n\nEventually the customer hangs up but what happens afterwards between me and the interpreter is where the action really starts:\n\n&gt;Me: Ok, what happened? What does the custom- \n\n&gt;Interpreter: SHE HUNG UP! *sigh* Did you not listen to the conversation? Can't you fix something through that?\n\n&gt;Me: Unfortunately I can't. Since I cannot understand Spanish fluently, I am unable to understand the customer. This is why we needed the interpreter to translate the message to me so that I could assist her in the best possible way.\n\n&gt;Int: God, you're useless. *Hangs Up*\n\nDo people just hire some crazy person off the street to do this shit?\n\nTL;DR: I have hearing damage through a soap opera.\n",

        "text": "So I'm a long time viewer, first time poster. Please excuse the formatting. :) \n\nSo a little back story: I worked at a call center for multiple major retailers. There was a secret iron curtain to our customers that the rep you were speaking with at one retailer, would take another call for a competitor afterwards. Of course each retailer has its own policies as well. \n\nAnd away we go.\n\nGuy calls in because he's trying to order his customized jersey and the order will not place. \n\nMe: \"Thanks for calling retailstore1_! How I can help?\"\nC: \"I'm getting an error code when placing my order. It says that there's not enough funds, when I know there is.\" \nM: Sorry! Let's take a look at the credit card charges here. (We had a system we could run a card in that would tell us auth holds, charges, credits, and error codes of why it didn't go through.) \n\nSo there's two things sticking out to me. Customer here has attempted to place the order 6 times, using the wrong billing address, and now he has 6 authorization holds of 150 each. \n\nNow normally a auth hold disappears in 3-5 days depending on your bank. This retailer used a system that applied them to ensure the funds are available when we actually shipped the item in 48 hours. \n\nSo I proceed to tell this customer this and apologize. Of course this kicks off an entire yelling rant of thievery etc, but he tells me that we can use a different card and I can place the order. I advise that if it's from the same bank, he may get locked out. He doesn't care. Jersey is more important. \n\nGet to putting a shipping address in, he gives me a hotel address. Whatever. \nGo to billing address, and he says it's the same. \n\nM: \"Mr. C, are you sure this is the address you get your statements too?\" \nC: \"Oh! No. That's 123 ABC st. Haha that was what my wife put in.\" \n\nExplains the 6 auth holds.\n\n Go to submit order, ask his permission, and card declined. He must've been trying to use a different card from the same bank because now when I run his card in our magical system, it's saying don't honor, call the bank. Idiot locked himself out like I was scared of.\n\nDeep breath, start with explaining and apologizing. He has to call his bank.  \n\nCue the next 30 minutes of cussing me out. \n\nCrazy customer hangs up to call his bank. And then 2 hours later calls retailstore2, retail store1 major competitor. \n\nI recognized the name and voice instantly. I mean, less than 2 hours ago, this man was calling me the rudest names in the world for 30 mins because I advised him to call his bank. \n\nHe's being super calm. Asks to place an order. We start going through it. And just because I'm me, and can't help being sarcastic, as I'm adding his jersey into the cart, I thank him for choosing us as his jersey store. \n\nAnd it began. \n\nHe started complaining about the other retailer and the rep(me) who stole \"3K\" from him. Rep was so rude, etc. \n\nAnd the entire time I'm trying not to laugh as I'm apologizing to hear he went through that. No, retailstore2 only charges when we ship. \n\nFinally finish his order and bam. He asked to be transferred to my sup for a kudos. I was the best representative he ever spoke too. I mean, I treated him with the same professionalism and empathy on both calls. Crazy customers, man. \n\nWhen my sup reviewed the calls, he gave me two break coupons. 1 for the kudos, and another 1 for giving him a good laugh from the way I handled the second call. \n\nTldr: cst calls me at one retailer because he doesn't know his own address, and called another retailer to complain about me to me.

That isn't true.\n\nMe: Ok....so what exactly is the reason for your call?\n\nC: I want you to give me actual correct information! \n\nMe: I did. So is there any other information I-\n\nC: You are not providing correct information. I want you to-\n\n*click*\n\n\nI ended up just hanging up on the guy. Since no account information was pulled up theres no way for the call to be tracked. I mean if he really knew so much he shouldnt have even had to call. Why are people to f***ing stupid?????",

        "text": "FTP, on mobile etc. I found you guys and am so glad that I have the opportunity to post, as I drive my boyfriend nuts with stories! (Names have been changed &amp; details omitted for privacy.)\n\nI work in a call centre doing rostering. Our job is primarily meant to be rostering, but sometimes the calls take priority and push us behind schedule. We're not very big- about 50 staff in our section of a larger company- and deal with both clients and employees across the state. The aim of the game is to roster the employees to meet with the clients a mutually suitable time.\n\nMany of my employees say, \"I could never do your job, it's like tetris! Trying to fit everyone in with each other!\" And therefore most of them are understanding. But sometimes they go a bit nuts...\n\nOne day my colleague ($C) got a call from one of our employees, her name was something like Victoria ($V). Here's how the call went down:\n\n$C: Welcome to [company], my name is $C, how can I help you?\n\n$V: Yes hi $C, its Vicki, how are you today?\n\n$C: Good thanks, Victoria, how are you?\n\n*the line goes silent a moment, then she begins yelling down the phone in a high-pitched squeak*\n\n$V: IT'S VICKI, NOT VICTORIA, DON'T YOU GET IT?? MY NAME IS VICKI. VICKI. I DON'T LIKE BEING CALLED VICTORIA, IS THAT WHATS ON [SHARED COMPANY SYSTEM]?! BECAUSE IT SHOULD BE VICKI!!\n\n$C: Okay I'm very sorry about that, /Vicki/, but your name does display as Victoria in our system, so that's how we verify you.\n\n$V: WELL CHANGE IT THEN, IT SHOULD SAY VICKI, I DON'T EVER WANT TO BE CALLED VICTORIA!! I HATE THAT NAME!\n\n$C: Not a problem, Vicki, unfortunately I can't change your name in the system so I'll have to ask your supervisor to change it for you, but that should be fine.  Now, what did you need help with today?\n\n$V: Well it SHOULD say that in the system, that's what everyone else calls me! I had a client call me Victoria the other day and it was so embarrassing! What do you tell these people??\n\n$C: Normally we tell them your name as based on the system, I can see that Vicki does come up as your preferred nam, but Victoria still is there also. Sometimes we get it wrong, but we'll tell the client your name as per the system.\n\n$V: Well I want to make sure you get it changed so it JUST says Vicki! Nobody needs to know the full name Victoria, that's ridiculous! And make sure you pass it on to your colleagues, too!\n\nThe rest of the call was eventually completed, but $C was a bit rattled. And sure enough, in the next few minutes an email gets sent around to the floor saying, \"Make sure you call her /Vicki/, everyone! She doesn't like the other name!\"",

        "text": "So I currently work as a Customer Service Agent in Germany for a very well known internationally operating Website, which offers all kinds of products ranging from Phones to Apps.\n\n\nOne day this Kid started spam calling us and started saying random and obscene things. This went on for many days. During one call he just made fart noises, or at other calls, where female coworkers picked up, he asked them for their addresses and if he may come by to have intercourse with them.\n\n\nOur Supervisor already informed us all via our teamchat about this. Then I got this kid on the phone on day:\n\n\nME will be me. K will be the kid.\n\n\nME: \"Welcome to Example Company Customer Service! My name is 5putnik. How may I help you today?\"\n\n\nK: \"May I take a sh*t in your mouth?\"\n\n\nMe: \"Um, excuse me?\"\n\n\nK: \"You heard me b*tch.\"\n\n\nME: \"Listen buddy, you do know that this call and all the other ones can be traced back to your exact location once I give this to our legal department, right? They will then transfer this straight to the police and be assured that we will press charges.\"\n\n\nAt this point it went silent on the other line until I heard him sobbing.\n\n\nME: \"Would you like to apologize?\"\n\n\nK: *starts crying* \"Yes please I'm very sorry and will never do this again...\"\n\n\nME: \"Great! Would you also like to apologize to my coworkers you have harrased, up until today?\"\n\n\nK: \"Yes! What will happen when the police gets these calls from you guys?\"\n\n\nME: \"Well your parents will receive a notification about this and will have to go to court because of this, since, according to law, they haven't paid attention to you and your doings and haven't raised you well apparently. Child services will take on from there probably.\"\n\nAt this point the kid just bursted out in a tyrad of crying, sobbing and snorting his nose. Usually we stay really professional about this, and just dismiss these calls, but this kid broke some records and just wouldn't stop. I mean he went on for 9 days straight and never got tired of it apparently. Summer Break must have been really boring.\n\n\nJust to push his buttons I started telling him that we can charge him for sexual harrassment of multiple female coworkers, holding our lines for no reason, may result in his mom paying us damage costs which were made to the company (at which I told him will range above 10.000 Euros), since real customers with real issues couldnt come through, etc. etc.\n\n\nK: \"Please dont tell the Police, my Mom will be very upset!\"\n\n\nME: \"Well why do you keep calling us then and keep harrassing us or calling us names?\"\n\n\nK: \"It was just a joke Mr. 5putnik! I'm really sorry. It won't happen again!\"\n\n\nI ended the call without assuring him that I won't give this to our legal department, telling him I will consider it.\n\n\nFun Fact: Our legal department does not track phone calls and we dont route phone calls to the police, but this is the best way to scare off these \"prankers\". Thank me later family.",

It was hell working there, especially the second time around where they had been bought by another major company and had many policy changes. I have a crap ton of stories from my time working there, but this one takes the cake.\nIn the call Center, the majority of the calls I got were from senior citizens who didn't want to be bothered trying to figure out ho to use the website. It was a 50/50 chance that you'd get a nice one, because a lot of them were really mean. This lady...she was mean/stupid in some aspects. \nIn this scenario, I'll be Me and Lady will be L.\n\nMe: Thank you for calling JobThatMakesMeCry, this is Sherlock, how can I help you?\nL: yes I want to order something to be delivered. \nMe: Okay, I can totally help you with that.\n\nI'll  just shorten this by saying that a lot of our senior customers look at the catalog while they're on the phone, and often it's never the most recent catalog. JobThatMakesMeCry only gave their call Center employees the most recent catalog as a reference, so when someone asked for the pears on page 6, I would sometimes turn there and see truffles. After a little trouble with he page number, I finally figure out what she wants and get it put in. \n\nMe: Alrighty then, it looks like your total is $WayTooMuchForFreakingPears.\n\nThis is when she loses it.\n\nL: NOW YOU JUST WAIT A MINUTE! YOU JUST WAIT. I GET FREE SHIPPING, DONT YOU TRY TO CHARGE ME FOR SHIPPING NOW.\n\nThis happened a lot, customers would have coupons and forget to tell me that they had it, and then they'd lose their shit when you have them the price that included shipping.\n\nMe: Okay, well do you happen to have a coupon code?\nL: YES!!! \nMe: Can I have it?\nL: (rattles off this long af code)\nMe: It looks like this coupon code has already been used before.\nL: Yes, I used it the other day.\nMe: Ma'am, you can only use a coupon code once.\nL: Well, I just thought I could use it again. Can't you just pass it through?\nMe: I'm afraid not, ma'am. There's no way my system will let me.\nL: Well the young man I talked to the other day told me I could!\nMe: (losing my patience) I'm sorry, but he was wrong. Do you happen to have another coupon code I could use?\nL: Yes, but it says \"Share with a friend.\" Am I allowed to use it on myself?\nMe: I'm not going to stop you. \n\nI type it in, it works, the day is saved, she gets her pears, I go home and cry once again.

If you want to pay the same bill 10 times, that's your problem.\n\n2. How are we supposed to know you already paid if you used anothers bank card.\n\nMe: Sir, please understand, we...\n\nCH: Shut up stupid, you don't speak english, you speak stupid. \n\nDoes he know any other word?\n\nMe: SIr, I would ask you to be respectfull...\n\nCH: Sutpid bank, stupid girl.

We take care of all the German speaking countries in Europe, which besides Germany also means Austria, Switzerland and a little bit of Belgium.\n\n\nOne day this English Lady calls in. From her accent when speaking German, you could already tell that she was clearly more English then a cup of Earl Grey tea made by Winston Churchill himself. \nBL will be Britishlady, ME is... well me, who else?\n\n\nME(In German): \"Hello and welcome to Example Company Customer Service! My name is 5putnik, how may I help you?\"\n\n\nBL(In broken German with a strong accent): \"Uhmm.... Hello, my name... is British Lady.... uhmm... do you speak English?\"\n\n\nME (Switching to English): \"Yes ma'am, how may I help you today?\"\n\n\nBL (In English, with an angry tone): \"So I was trying to purchase some things from your store, but I can't buy anything for some reason!\"\n\n\nME: \"No worries ma'am. May I have your E-Mail address so that I can check your customer account?\"\n\n\nBL (annoyed):\"I don't know why you would need that. It's; britishlady@examplemail.com\"\n\n\n(So here I do the normal authentication in order to prove that the customer is the owner of the said account. I also explained this to her in detail. I then find out that she still has her address in England saved in as her standard address, she needs to change it to her german Address so that she can order from the german online store in Germany. This is to make sure no Taxes are being misshandled or no scams are being made. Germans and their bureaucracy right?)\n\n\nME: \"Well ma'am, as far as I can see, you still have your english address saved into your account. You will have to change this to your german address, in order to shop in the german online store.\"\n\n\nBL: \"Why do you have to make this shit so complicated?! Where can I do this?! On the main site?!\"\n\n\nME: \"I'm sorry to hear that you are frustrated. If you just go under payments.examplecompany.com and log in there with your account you should be able to change the address in the options.\"\n\n\nBL: *sighs* \"Fine. Hold on.\"\n\n\n(Types on her keyboard which sounds like Gallagher slamming melons.)\n\n\nBL: \"It can't find the site. Your site is broken! ALL YOUR SHIT WONT WORK!\"\n\n\nME: \"Excuse me ma'am, I'm sorry to hear that you feel that way. But I will have to ask you to remain calm or I will have to terminate this call. Have you checked the address you entered for any typing errors?\"\n\n\nAnd thats when it started. Holy mother of Jesus. For some reason this woman went batshit on my ass. She pulled all the guns of the Great British Empire on me and pulled all the triggers at the same time.\n\n\nBL: \"HOW DARE YOU! AS AN AMERICAN-, GERMAN BLOKE OR WHATEVER THE HELL YOU ARE HAVE THE AUDACITY TO QUESTION MY ENGLISH SKILLS. I'M FROM ENGLAND, I KNOW HOW TO SPELL IN ENGLISH!\"\n(Note: I used to live in the US, so I have an american accent when speaking english. Hence why she thinks I might be american or german, which im neither of btw.)\n\n\nME: \"Ma'am please calm down, I'm trying to help you here. No need to yell at me. Can you at least please spell me out then how you wrote payments?\"\n\n\nBL: \"P-A-I-M-I-N-T-S.\"\n\n\nME (trying not to laugh as hard as I can): \"Ok ma'am, but you do know that you spell payments P-A-Y-M-E-N-T-S and not with I's, right?\"\n\n\n(Audible typing like Gallagher slamming melons again.)\n\n\nBL (with a very soft and shaky voice): \"Uhmm.... ok, that worked... thank you... bye.\"\n\n\n*Phone clicks*\n\n\nThe Quality Assurance department had quite a laugh at this one.",

She then goes:\n\nH: Yea so like I just want to schedule installation, I know the system is slow there in India but like you know I just want to schedule installation ASAP. \n\nM: Oookay so the earliest day I see available is Tuesday September 5th, does that work for you?\n\nH: Uhhhhhhh so like I know it's slow there but I would like to have installation scheduled for Sunday September 3rd.\n\nI explain to her a few times that September 5th is the earliest date available as our installers take Sundays and Mondays off.\n\nH: Look I understand that you might be getting the time zones mixed up since you're in India but I want installation done on September 3rd. \n\nThis lady simply couldn't accept the fact that we can't schedule installation for an earlier date.\n\nM: I see. Please stay on the line while I transfer you over to Customer Service. \n\nH: Are they located in India as well? \n\nM: ............................................................. no ma'am they're located *locally* as well. Have a nice day.\n\n-click-\n\nMy condolences to my coworkers in CS as they can't really do anything for this customer, and especially to the person who got this customer as they would've had to transfer her back to us at Home Delivery. \n\nEdit: removed company name. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I put the customer in good and get one on the line. \n\nOnce the interpreter is in the line the patient goes into this long winded story in Russian. I don't speak Russian but she sounded pretty upset. She was wanting to know if we'd received her referral for a particular clinic that required one. \n\nAfter looking her up I was able to confirm that no, we haven't received it yet. Then she goes into another long winded upset sounding speech in Russian. The interpreter kept trying to get her attention but she just kept going for like 5 minutes. In the end, the interpreter tells me she has no idea what this lady said and she's not making any sense. \n\nI take a look at the notes that offer some clarification that she's wanting to be scheduled but we still don't have a referral but she had said that one was sent. I told her I'd have the clinic call her to see if maybe we had received it but it wasn't in the system yet or something. \n\nThis call ended up being an hour long of alternating this speaking upset sounding long winded Russian gibberish (interpreter's words, not mine)  and me telling her I can't do anything other than send a message and have the clinic call her. What the interpreter did pick up literally 6-8 times in that call was \"how long do I have to wait?\" I'd tell her over and over that the clinic do their best to call her today and she'd just go into another long winded Russian/gibberish rant. \n\nThat was one of my first calls of the day and it left my super exhausted. My interpreter basically gave up and is like \"idk she makes no sense\". ",

Some stuff like at home workouts(think P90x), the MyPillow, grills, ladders, and skin care products. About 3 or 4 months ago we started selling a male enhancement supplement, and most of the calls are pranks or people not wanting to pay 60 dollars for a dick pill that they don't know will work.\n\nSo a few nights ago I get one of these calls.\n\nM=Me, LG= \"lawyer guy\"\n\n&gt;M: Thank you for calling Dickpill company, my name is Yesman69, our calls are recorded for quality assurance, is that okay?\n\n&gt;LG: Yeah yeah whatever, I wanted to get the free supply you guys advertise on the radio, I was just wondering how to get that?\n\nThe commercial he's talking about only plays on the radio, in the commercial it clearly states \"Call now and ask how to get a free months supply!\" So it doesn't state that there is a sample pack, or that you get a totally free supply, just that you can get a free supply, which is true. The pricing is $60 for a month supply, or you can buy a 2 month supply for $120 and you get the third month free. That's how you get it. So I explain to him how it works and he comes back with a fantastic reply.\n\n&gt;LG: So it's not a free supply?\n\n&gt;M: Well sir, you would need to get a 2 month supply to get that free month, but you do have a 30-day money back guarantee so if you're not satisfied you can return it, you would just be out the shipping cost.\n\n&gt;LG: Well you see sir, now you have a lawsuit on your hands. Me and my brother are class actions lawsuit lawyers and we always check on these free offers and see if they are legit. This one is a scam so you might wanna get your supervisor and let him know whats going on and get back to me so I can get the free supply and not file a class action lawsuit against your company.\n\n&gt;M: okay sir give me one moment to grab him really quick and I'll see what he says, so hold for one moment.\n\nSo I place him on hold and tell my manager what he said. So we decide to listen to the commercial to see what exactly is says, and it says \"ask how to get your free supply when you call now!\" So while misleading, is not stating that is absolutely free, just that you can get a free supply. So my manager tells me to give him the customer service number, but let him know what the commercial says and have fun with it. So I do.\n\n&gt;M: Alright sir are you still there?\n\n&gt;LG: Yes I am, and how will I be getting my free supply?\n\n&gt;M: Well sir, unfortunately, we do not have a way on our end to get you a totally free supply, but if you got the 2 months package we'd be happy to give you that third month free. Otherwise, I can only direct you to CS and you would have to talk to them about it.\n\n&gt;LG: Okay but I am telling you that you guys are looking at one hell of a class action suit.\n\n&gt;M: Well sir I cannot speak to that, but what did the commercial say exactly? because the only commercial that we currently air only says to ask how to get a free supply, not that you get free samples or anything.\n\n&gt;LG: Well how the hell do I get the free supply then?!\n\n&gt;M: You get a free months supply when you buy a 2 months supply.\n\n&gt;LG:...............\n\n&gt;M: Are you still there sir?\n\n&gt;LG:... yeah I'm here, well let my bank account real quick to see if I have the money in my account.\n\n&gt;M: Not a problem sir take your time.\n\nDude goes away for about 2 or 3 minutes, and I can hear him cussing under his breath and shuffling. He finally comes back on the phone...\n\n&gt;LG: Alright so I don't have the money in my account right now so i'll have to call you back when i get paid.\n\n&gt;M: Not a problem sir! Whenever you decide to call back, please don't hesitate to pick up the phone and give us a call, we'll be here 24/7\n\n&gt;*click*\n\nSeriously the most satisfying thing to listen to a guy claim to be a lawyer, then listen to him eat his own words, but also that he claimed to be a big class action lawyer yet didn't have 60 bucks in his account.",

        "text": "Explanation: i work at a call centre for tv, int, hp and mobility. Our managers literally have us document the techs' employee id every time because they try to pawn off all their calls on us. Our system runs like this: a customer calls, you fix their issue, call disconnects. If that same customer calls again, and your line is open, they will be put back to you, and the same thing goes for transferring to other departments. \n\nAnyway, I had a tech rep trying to give me a call, telling me that the customer was given 2 pvr's in error and because we made the order, we had to fix it. I explained that we give customers the same receiver, and they are programmed as pvr's so there's no possible way that her tv wasn't working because of that. She kept reiterating the same nonsense and I was like. Dude, not our department SO this tech says \"can I speak to your manager? You obviously don't know how to do your job\" so I laugh and say sure! I call over my sup to take the call where he calmly explains that it's not our responsibility, and tells her what to do, she says she doesn't know how to do that and my sup says \"maybe you should go ask your own manager then\" and disconnected the call. \n\nI got her a second time- the customer wanted to know what they were paying for, so I asked her if the customer had given any other info that would be useful to me on this call and the rep just says \"this is your responsibility. It's all they said.\" So I was like... ok, bring em over. And generally when you transfer a call you say like \"thanks for waiting! This is omnisera from our customer care and she's gonna take over from here. Thanks for calling, have a great day!\" And hang up, but tech rep just says \"This is omnisera from our customer care\" and I was waiting for her to say bye.. and then the rep goes \"TAKE. OVER. THE CALL.\" Super aggressively and I was like (somehow super nicely for a passive aggressive bitch) \"I will, just waiting for you to disconnect\" then there was silence. I gave her ID to my supervisor and got her reported. We all hate our jobs too dude, no sense in making others miserable because you are ",

        "text": "LTL;FTP. My apologies for any wonky formatting, since I'm on mobile.\n\nI work for a long-term care pharmacy that was recently bought out by a popular retail pharmacy chain. This pharmacy services nursing homes, assisted living facilities, group homes, some drug/alcohol treatment facilities, and retirement communities. My day-to-day responsibility is to enter patient demographic information, including name, DOB, doctor, room, SSN, and insurance information. With most facilities, we do not necessarily need to have all of these pieces of information; usually, it's just the name, DOB, room, and doctor we need. The exception mainly lies with assisted living communities, drug/alcohol treatment, and group homes. For those homes, we also need the SSN and insurance information on admit. We are not allowed to route an admission forward without this information. The difficult part about all of this is that we occasionally have to track a facility down to get the information we need. This is usually not an issue except when it is. Sometimes it's difficult to get a hold of them. In this particular instance, I had a nurse from a drug/alcohol treatment center who was very suspicious about who I was. It should be noted that this was the first time I had called this facility, as this will be important later. The facility is located in a different state which we started servicing only within the last year. For the purposes of this story, I will be \"Me,\" she will be \"Nurse.\"\n\n&gt; Nurse: Thank you for calling *drug/alcohol treatment center*, this is (firstname), how can I help you?\n\nIt should also be noted that over the 4 years I've been here, I've developed a particular way of speaking on the phone. Sort of an internal script, if you will. It rarely gives me any issues.\n\n&gt; Me: Hello, this is the pharmacy, I'm calling in regards to a patient named (firstname lastname)\n\n&gt; Nurse: ...okay...?\n\n&gt; Me: We received their admission paperwork, but in order to admit them, we need their insurance information. Would you be able to verify this?\n\n&gt; Nurse: And which pharmacy are you calling from?\n\n&gt; Me: I'm from (pharmacy).\n\nIt's at this moment that I can tell from her tone and pauses that she's very suspicious of who I am and what I want.\n\n&gt; Nurse: And what's your name again?\n\n&gt; Me: My name is (firstname)\n\n&gt; Nurse: Okay. Let me just explain something to you. When answering the phone, you should be introducing yourself by name and the name of your pharmacy. When I heard your voice, I didn't recognize it which put me on the defensive. You also have a different area code coming up on my caller ID which is unfamiliar to me. I don't know who you are which is where I'm having a problem.\n\n&gt; Me: I apologize for that, and I totally understand. I will absolutely keep that in mind for next time. Are you still able to give me that information?\n\n&gt; Nurse: Based on everything that just went down, I'm not sure if I can fully trust you are who you say you are and we are dealing protected health information here. I feel like it would be a HIPPA violation if I was to give you that information, and for that reason I will not be providing it to you.\n\nareyoufuckingkiddingme.exe\n\n&gt; Me: I understand where you're coming from. However I must inform you that in order for me to process this admission as quickly as possible so that we may send out the medications, we will need the insurance information.\n\n&gt; Nurse: If that's the case, then I would feel much more comfortable calling our local pharmacy directly and giving them that information.\n\nAt that point I knew there wasn't any chance I was getting the information I needed, and like or or not, she had all the power in the situation. This call definitely taught me that even if you've been in a job for years, there's still more to learn. Since this call, I've changed the way I introduce myself and haven't had any issues since. I think that she was somewhat overzealous in her response, but I also understand where she was coming from in terms of HIPPA.",

        "text": "Hello! Long time lurker first time poster (Throwaway account).\n\nI have many, many stories to share about my 5 years ~~jail sentence~~ I spent tied to a phone. \n\nI used to work for a major ISP in the UK and my first ever call I took when going \"live\" sort of set the tone of how I perceived our precious customers. Our company had an option for our customers to install modems/ TV set top boxes on their own (providing that they have all the cabling and such before hand, such as previous owner of the property having our services)\nIt went something like this.\n\nM(Me): Hello, Thank you for calling ISP I'm Me, Whats your name and account details\n\nI(Idiot): Yes, I'm Idiot and here's my account info. I have ordered my modem a few days ago and was told it would be here today before 4PM. It's now 6PM and i still don't have any equipment. \n\nM: Ohh, sorry about that. Lets have a look on the account. So... I can see that the package has been delivered by one of the courier companies we use. Are you sure you or someone else in the house has not received a package today? \n\nI: No, its only me here today.\n\nM: Okay, not to worry. It may be a mistake on our systems, or it may have been given to a neighbor. One moment please, ill place you on a quick hold.\n\nI Called the courier company to get tracking info on this product. I was told by the agent that the package was delivered to a Miss Idiot at 14:30 and it was signed by her. \n\nM: Hello again, thanks for staying on the line, Idiot. I've called the courier company and they have confirmed that the package was delivered to your property. \n\nI: Well I can *assure* you that I haven't received it. \n\nM: Well I can *assure* you that you have. It was signed for at 14:30 by Miss Idiot. Idiot, has anyone been to your door today? \n\nI: Well yes. Someone has delivered this brown box. (Penny still hasn't dropped yet) \n\nM: . . . May I ask what was inside that brown box (trying not to let the sound of teeth grinding come through the phone) \n\nI: Well not that it concerns you. However, its unopened. \n\nM: Idiot. Can you open the box. PLEASE.\n\nI: Ugh I suppose. \n\nShe then slams the phone down and as she is walking away she starts muttering about how pointless this exercise is.\n\nI: Right, its some plastic box. I don't know. \n\nM: Does this box black have ports for cables in the back? Does this box have our company logo on it. . .\n\nI: Yes. What have you sent me?!? \n\nM: The modem. That's your modem, Idiot. \n\nI: Well...when is someone coming over to install it. \n\nM: You chose our self install option. You do it yourself (but judging by how dense you are. I highly doubt you actually knew that). All you have to do is follow the *simple* instructions on the leaflet that's attached to the lid of the box.\n\nI: Ohh I don't know about this. I'm not technically minded.  \n\nM: It's really simple. Just connect the black wire to the black port. The yellow wire to the yellow port. White wire to the (you've guessed it) the white port. Call the activation number and that's you all set up. ( its as simple as that. A trained monkey, with one hand, can do this)\n\nI: Is this so I can get internet?\n\nM: Yes, that allows you to get online. Just follow the simple steps.\n\nThis goes on for some time. I could of transferred this customer to someone who assists customers with setting this up, however that queue leads to some poor agent a few rows ahead of me. Since I was new, I wanted to make a good impression on our team. We also had a flow chart of who's responsible for what issues. And this type of call was classed as a \"sit where it hits\". Which means that anyone, in any customer service type department has to help with this issue first time. (saves on transfers and increases first time resolution).\n\nThis call eventually ended up being trucked ( sent to an engineer to come and plug some cables in) and our precious Idiot had to wait over two weeks for someone to come and plug a few cables into the box.\n\nNow I would love to say that this type of call was a rare. But alas my friends, these idiots are everywhere. \n\n",

Usually the card is available the next business day after they make the payment, but if the customer request to have the card available right away, all I have to do is dial her bank, verified the customer has enough funds to cover the payment they just made, if they do, then I can make the card available.\nI explain this to the customer and she was fine with it, so I dialed the other bank.\n\nMe: Yours truly\n\nABA: ANother bank agent\n\nCH: Customer.\n\n\nABA: Thank you for calling AnotherBank, this is ABA speaking. How may I help you?\n\nMe: Hello, this is Pablizza93 from MyBank. I called to make a fund verification.\n\nABA: I am sorry, I'm afraid I don't understand what you need.\n\nMe: I have a mutual customer on the other line, she just made a payment using her bank account with you, so I'm calling to verified she has enough money to cover the payment. I will bring the customer into the line so you can talk to her. \n\nABA: I cannot give you information on a customer without her consent.\n\nMe: As I mentioned, I'm going to bring the customer into le line. You can ask for her permission to disclosure information with a third party, as well as any other information that you need from her. \n\nABA: I just don't get what do you need.\n\nMe: I just need to know if the customer has enough funds in her account to cover the payment she just made. \n\nABA: Yeah but why.\n\nMe: I work for my bank, I'm just trying to get that information so I can have her credit card available.\n\nABA: I don't think that's legal.\n\nMe: Is standar procedure, I don't know what the problem is, I've done this hundreds of times before.\n\nNow the other agent just wouldn't understand, she kept arguing that she couldn't give me that information. I was running out of patience and the customer has been on hold for a unnecesary amount of time, so I just brought the customer into the line even thought the other agent still was not convinced (Not a great plan) \n\nCH: Dear lord, that was a very long hold.\n\nMe: I'm sorry Ms Customer for the time you have to wait for me, I have ABA on the other line from ANotherBank and she will help us today with the funds verification\n\nABA: Gives customer standar greeting\n\nCH: Hi my name is Ms Customer, I made a payment to my credit card and I need to have my money available, so I just need you to tell the girl on the line that i can afford the payment I just made. I'm going to give you my checking account number... \n\nABA: (interrumpting the customer) I'm going to stop you right there Ms Customer. Is my job to protect your information and to be honest this call sounds like a scam. Why would a filipino girl would need to know your bank information? I will recommend you not to give your information to her.\n\n\n(So:\n1. This girl is a racist.\n\n2. I'm not filipino, I'm Nicaraguan.\n\n3. So ABA thinks I called the bank just to get the CH checking account number. Like I already have the CH checking account number, I just processed her payment.)\n\n\nLong story short, the agent ended up convincing the ch I was trying to steal her money. She convinced her of changing her account number, and they disconnected me from the call. \n\n\nTl;DR: The agent was a racist bitch who assumed I was trying to scam the customer just because I have an accent",

Here's one I had last week or so.\n\nCust: Hi, I've lost my debit card and someone's been making purchases with it.\n\nMe: Sorry to hear that. [*sees only entries on statement are things like supermarkets, cinemas, leisure centres, takeaways*] Which of the payments on your statement do you not recognise?\n\nCust: All of these ones (supermarkets etc) except the ones where I've phoned that takeaway\n\nMe: How have you done those ones then since you lost your card?\n\nCust: I know my card details off by heart, that's why I didn't notice it was missing for a while because I don't need it when buying online or on the phone\n\n*[edit: there was a hold here as I was sure something about this guy's story didnt add up so I looked into all the payments in detail]* \n\nMe: All of these payments you don't recognise were made using your pin number, how would someone have known that?\n\nCust: All of my friends know it, but I've asked them slyly if they've gone to the cinema lately and none of them have\n\nMe: And how exactly do they know it? You aren't supposed to give it out to people...\n\nCust: I have it written down on a slip of paper at home, anyone who comes into my home can see it.\n\nMe: And why do you have it written down?\n\nCust: I have memory issues and keep forgetting it.\n\n[*one of our processes is that if someone has to write down/tell someone their pin because of mental/physical illness, we wouldn't consider that stupidity - this process is abused a lot by customers*]\n\nMe: You have memory issues that affect you remembering a 4 digit number but you can easily rhyme off a 16 digit card number, back 3 numbers and an expiry date?\n\nCust: I have them written down as well, I have all my banking details written down\n\nMe: But you just told me on this recorded call that you memorised them and have been able to make payments like that\n\n[*at this point I didn't even let him respond as I was nearing a break and had enough bullshit for one evening*]\n\nMe: *...scripting scripting scripting....* the bank will not be refunding this money as we don't have any reason to believe the payments have been made fraudulently\n\n[*customer hangs up without arguing*]\n\n\n",

I have a lot of horror stories, but this is the most memorable, because is the one that made me decided to quit my job. \n\nOne cold sunday evening this lady called to demand that I improved her credit score. I explained her that the bank reports all her account information to the credit bureaus but cannot change the credit score at will. I offered to help her to contact the Credit bureaus if she had any question about how the credit score is calculated. She lost it. She started shouting abuse about how I was a \"dumb b*tch\" and \"this is you f*cking job\", she screamed at me for a good ten minutes and then she said she will wait on the line til I improve her credit score.\n\nMe (Trying not to cry): Well ma'am, this will be a long call, as I'm unable to do so.\n\nThe Lady: That's your f*cking job, do you have any problem doing your job.\n\nMe: Yes I do. My problem is that I have to deal with horrid people like you.\n\nThe lady: B*tch, get me your supervisor, I'm going to get you fire. \n\nMe: Be my guest, you'll be doing me a favor to be honest. I will happily connect you to my supervisor now.\n \nAfter that I cold transfered the call without even waiting for her reply. Next day I gave my two weeks notice. ",

        "text": "Edited: typos  \n\nI work for a company that builds online services for other companies and provides technical support for them afterward. As with most tech support, 99% of calls are helping computer illiterate people navigate how to use one.\n\nI never assume the caller knows anything computer related. For example, if I have to ask them what browser they are using, I always quickly list the most common ones and what the icon looks like to help them identify it. \n\nHowever, I can't account for callers that don't know normal human things.\n\nOne of these instances of this was a young-ish man struggling to search for a specific accident report using one of our services.\n\nMe: Company name. This is Me. How may I help you?\n\nCaller: I can't find my report. Your website is broken.\n\nMe: I'm happy to look into any trouble you are experiencing. Are you getting any error messages?\n\nCaller: It says my search credentials are invalid, but I know they are right. I've had enough of this. Can't you just email me my report?\n\nMe: Due to confidential information in the reports, we are not authorized to email them. But I am more than happy to help you access the report online. Can you read me your payment confirmation number, so I can see how the search is functioning on my end?\n\nCaller: Well, the site is broken, so not sure what you are going to be able to do.\n\nMe: *ignore* Can you please read me the payment confirmation number in your receipt email?\n\n*Note: all payment confirmation numbers for this service have the same format. Six letters, a few zeros, and then more numbers. They are case sensitive in that all letters must be upper case. They never have the letter oh.\n\nCaller: aaabbb0001234\n\nMe: I am able to locate your report on my end. When you enter the payment confirmation, are you entering it with capital letters? They have to be capitalized.\n\nCaller: Um... I think so.\n\nMe: Sir, I need you to confirm you are typing capital letters instead of lower case. It will not work with lower case letters.\n\nCaller: What about the ohs?\n\nMe: *Thinking we have found the cause of the issue.* There are no ohs. There are only zeros. Please make sure you are typing zeros.\n\nCaller: Are those capitalized too?\n\nMe: Uh, no. They are not.\n\nCaller: How should I enter them then?\n\nMe: Just type with the zero key.\n\nCaller: Ugh! It's still broken! \n\nMe: There are a few other things that may be causing the error. Do you have the caps lock on?\n\nCaller: *groans* I don't understand why your giving me the run around instead of fixing the problem.\n\nMe: There are no factors indicating this is a system issue. I'm attempting to assist you with locating your report online. To do so, there is some troubleshooting required. \n\nMe: Let's try this again. Can you erase everything in the field, and I'll read off each character how you should enter it. Make sure to use the shift key for all letters. *Proceed to read off each character as \"big A,\" \"big B,\" \"number zero,\" \"number 2,\" etc.*\n\nCaller: It's still not working. Just email it to me like you should have at the start.\n\nMe: As I mentioned, the reports can't be email due to the security policies in place. \n\nCaller: You're no help. Your website is broken. Fix it.\n\n*Caller hangs up on me.*\n\nHe sounded to be 35-40. How do these people function? I still think he was typing ohs instead of zeros the whole time. \n\n",

Perhaps we could check something that interests you in the non-premium vehicles? \n\nHim: But surely there's something we can do! Otherwise I won't do business with you.\n\nMe: Sir, you cannot rent a premium vehicle without a credit card, it is company policy and I cannot breach it.

Today a lady called very pissed off because she has not received a payment for an item she returned.  I verified that the return was processed 2months ago and attempted to refund her money.  After receiving an error message multiple times when trying to credit her card,  I reached out to my supervisor.  My supervisor kept stalling when I told her the customer wanted to speak to her.  My supervisor then said \"the system\"  isn't letting anyone credit this customers return.  At this point the customer has been on hold for awhile so you can only imagine how pissed she was.  My supervisor kept asking me to relay messages to the customer. Let me remind you that the customer asked to speak to a Supervisor as soon as I accepted her call.  Yet her I am playing the messenger role and apologizing for the inconvenience.  The customer was so infuriated because she couldn't understand why the process was taking so long and to be honest I couldn't either.  I kept asking my supervisor for an update and she kept making excuses.  Long story short I just told my supervisor \"I'm not going to say another word to this woman,  you take the  call\" . \n\nThis company has some pretty strange practices that I feel may result in legal action. Often times there will be items listed on our website as instock when in actuality we have hundreds of back orders. Also this company claims not to charge customers until the item has shipped yet I've been getting more calls from people saying they have been charged for an item that hasn't shipped at all \n\nI hope I find a new job soon.  ðŸ™ƒ",
