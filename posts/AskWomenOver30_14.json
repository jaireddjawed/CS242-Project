        "text": "I know it all sounds very high school, but there is a rumor going around my friend group about someone I slept with (before my bf was in the picture).  He was never someone I’d actually date - we were both drunk and it was meaningless and I’m embarrassed about the whole thing.  My bf doesn’t know that I slept with this person, but he knows the guy through friends of friends.  I thought it would all go away and I would never have to bring this person up, but now my bf is engaging in the gossip and I’m scared he will hear about it through others and be caught off guard when someone mentions me and this other person.  Would you tell your bf or just ignore the rumor mill in hopes he’ll never hear about it?  I’d address it if he did find out the story, but things are so new and I’d rather not spend more energy on the situation if it becomes a non-issue anyway.  Personally I don’t know why it’s anyone’s business who I or this guy slept with and wish people would stop, but I don’t know if ignoring it would be damaging to my relationship?",

        "text": "I have been married with my husband for a couple of years and we’re overall very happy. However I’m really struggling about how to maintain a relationship with my in-laws that makes them and my husband happy, knowing that I feel zero “chemistry” between his parents and me (English is not my native language, hopefully everything in this post is clear). For some reason they adore me, but I feel like we have nothing in common, and after nearly a decade of relationship I’ve just run out of topics given that pretty much every single day of their life is the same (church for my mil and tv for my fil). I’ve tried doing outings together but basically my mil is only interested in religious things (and I’m not religious), and my fil is not fit enough for outdoor stuff.\n\nMy fil just sent a dramatic (in my opinion) email asking why I wasn’t joining them on calls anymore. I did it very occasionally before, but I just don’t feel like it anymore because he always asks the same two questions, and then just talks over everyone for the rest of the call. \n\nFor context they live about a 7h drive away, and we usually see them at least for Easter, Thanksgiving and in the summer. My family lives in another continent, so our visits there are less frequent but much longer, and what’s really hard is that my husband loves my family and gets along super well with them, so he feels that it’s unfair…\n\nThere’s only another sibling in their family, but they’re single so all the “in-law” attention falls on me, and while it’s very sweet (and also weird to me lol) that they love me so much I find it suffocating. \n\nThis obviously makes my husband very sad, and I can’t really tell him that I’m “just not into them”, but he can feel it.\n\nWe’re on the fence about having kids, and I’m being honest one of the reasons is that I feel like we would have to spend more time with his family (although friends with kids have told me that their in laws would just talk about the kid then so it’s fine, but I know there would be comments I would find irritating like how “funny” it is when men help their wife with child care…). \n\nI find our interactions uncomfortable and thought staying polite and respectful would be enough, but they’re apparently looking for more. \n\nAny advice to keep my sanity but make them and my husband happier ? How do you deal with your in-laws if they’re different from your partner but he’s still close to them ? Thanks in advance !",

I’m an experienced teacher however this school has been hard work and some of the toughest years of my career. On top of this I have suffered with terrible depression in this time and ended up of Zoloft. The medication has greatly improved my mood however I have put on close to 25kg and continued to use food as a way to supplement my feelings. Prior to my weight gain I was a healthy weight, albeit very unhappy with my body due to years of disordered eating and traumatic relationships. My partner and I want to start a family desperately but I am afraid my unhealthy eating and weight will stand in our way, not to mention that my self esteem is in the pits. \nHow can I get back on track? Does anyone have tips to changing their mindset? What eating and gym programs have you used? I can’t stay like this and would love to hear of similar stories of people who have turned their life around. TY",

        "text": "The guy thinks I walk on water.  He’s the opposite of all the toxic men I’ve dated, gotten into situationships with, and have hurt me.  The problem is our conversations are so dull.  Everything I say is perfect, but there’s no why to that.  If I don’t say anything there is awkward silence.  I ask him questions, try to bring the conversations out of yes or no answers but whatever I say he agrees with and then follows with how amazing I am.  This guy has been nothing but sweet, and it’s obvious if I asked him to do anything ridiculous, like send me money or drive hours away to get me some ice cream, he’d do it no questions asked.  \n\nI feel awful, but I just don’t feel anything for him.  We have a second date planned for this weekend and he’s made it obvious he wants to date exclusively.  The idea of me saying he’s too nice sounds ridiculous to me but thats how I feel.  \n\nI reflected on how I felt when he texted as opposed to how’d I’d feel if certain other men who have breadcrumbed me did.  I would get more excited if past guys gave me attention and this one I wouldn’t mind if it went nowhere.  WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME??  \n\nI can tell he’d be a great boyfriend, but I wonder if he just wants a girlfriend, and he’d say this to anyone.  I plan on going on moe dates with him, but I can’t see myself dating someone exclusively that I’m not excited about.  I’ve been on first dates before where I could not wait to see that person again, and any other guy didn’t matter anymore.  This one I just don’t feel any spark or excitement.  Can a spark develop or is my gut just telling me we’re not compatible? I don’t want to pass up a good thing, but I don’t want t date someone just cuz he’s so nice.  What should I do?",

        "text": "I had a date earlier and I am just laughing at my realization of how geographically challenged I am.\n\nI use GPS to get everywhere, even the city I live in. I travel a lot however with new places it's difficult for me to pick up on routes, directions, and even be able to tell what neighborhoods I am in. Then after I travel I mostly forget about these things and mainly just think about what I experienced or did. I realized now this sounds bad because I was asked \"what part of London did you visit,\" and I really couldn't answer what neighborhood specifically because I don't know the neighbor hoods/ areas. Like I have to either pull up a map or tell them specifically I visited this bar, restaurant, or landmark and maybe they can figure it out. To me where I was isn't really important as what I was doing so I just don't remember the where details. \n\nOr the other night me and my friend were going to dinner at a restaurant that I have been to before, however we were walking and I got the blocks mixed up (went right instead of left) and had to resort to GPS.\n\nAlso I go hiking/camping/backpacking and even when I plan the trip details, after about 6 months it's hard for me to remember the name of the trailhead or specific campground. I just know general area (like Zion NP, Moab, Olympics).\n\nAm I alone in this? Haha is it even worth trying to be better at? I guess I'm feeling insecure because since I have such vague specifics even though I know the truth, it can seem like I'm lying about it because I'm lacking specific local details to be convincing. Like yes I've been to the Eiffel Tower but no I don't remember the name of the road it's on or the neighborhood or the name of the road the hostel I was staying in was on. I did know these details when I was there but now I've forgotten since it's been over a year. I can look them up and go from there and that can also help spark memory recall at times.",

What I am seeing about men especially makes it bleak and I'm starting to feel that I strongly dislike key traits about men and their typical mating strategy/needs/wants. I find the following general rules to be true.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n\\- a preference for young partners. I have studied men in hetero and homo relationships and this preference for young partners seems to be like ingrained in the male psyche, even when women are taken out of the equation. It kinda screams pedo to me. This need for young, hairless, perky, etc. Women generally don't show this tendency - our preference in a partner is usually give or take 5 years from our own age and we tend to be way more forgiving in the looks department. Also consent means a lot to most women - we tend to want a person who can meaningfully consent, i.e. they're physically and emotionally mature, have seen a lot in life and can engage on our level. Again a power disparity really turns me off at this point and don't understand how that can be a turn on for anyone really.\n\n\\- a preference for naïve. This may be restricted to hetero relationships but the need to mold their partner into what they want, someone who is a yes woman, cheerleads them and makes them feel like the best person in the world, the protector, the provider, all things good basically.  I dunno but women again generally want an equal - somebody who they can challenge and can challenge them. I hate power disparities of all kinds and definitely don't want one with my partner as I find it unsexy af and don't understand why most men need this.\n\n\\- the entitlement for sex, power, recognition etc. and when not received, becoming radicalized and then having this need to wreak havoc or actually perpetrate violence on innocent people. Think mass shootings, random murders \"to feel something\", engaging in terrorist attacks, etc etc etc",

The two main reasons for doing so were to get ready for baby making and to hopefully increase her libido. She had been on since she was 14 (for skin issues apparently) or so… so like 25+ years. As we have no immediate plans to replicate in the next 6-8 months we are both wonder when she might experience an increase in her sexual desire… at about 45 days off the medication… neither of us have noticed a change in her moods much less her being in THE mood more often.  Based on conversations we’ve had over the years, she can’t recall a time (or maybe isn’t admitting to it) when she was ever horny (ie never gone out of her way to peruse sex with anyone) even before we dated in college nor in HS. That said we do have sex like once a month or so though she is focused on reaching orgasm and i often feel like she appro our sex life as a chore or obligation. She is under the impression her lack or libido/hornyness is because she started taking the hormonal birth control at a younger age then most/some/might be wise… I’m starting think, that some how or “that part of her brain off has switched off”… that to her sex is like drinking water, required for life but not desirable or exciting in any way. it makes me depressed which also does no favors in exciting her. \n\nactual questions:\n\n \\- if you have stopped taking the pill after a decade or more, how did your libido change when you stopped taking hormonal birth control? Additionally where where any other changes to mood, energy level or your body? \n\n\\- can taking hormones for 25+ years cause permanent changes to her body and brain?\n\n\\- what changes, if any, did your libido experience after 35? … On or off the pill… \n\n\\- I’ve done my best to make myself more desirable: I’ve lost weight (not that I’m looking like Zac Efron but i wasn’t fat to begin with), changed my wardrobe, introduced sex toys and ”alternative“ acts like pegging to our sexual catalogue, increased the number of thoughtful gifts and massages I give. But i still feel like she has little sexual interest in me pass her “wifely duties” as she has called them… should this be a concern? \n\n  \n\\- how have you dealt with mis matched libidos in your marriages / long term relationships?",

        "text": "My boyfriend and I are both in our 30s (and have been for our whole relationship) and we've been together for more than 3 years. Lately I'm not sure if the relationship is going anywhere, although I love him deeply. \n\nHe keeps saying that he sees a future with me and assuring me that at some point we'll move in together, but he also says he's not ready for any of that and needs to work on himself and process some things from past relationships more first. I get that, because my journey hasn't been easy either. So I tried to be supportive of him not being ready. \n\nIn the year to 1.5 years since I started having that conversation with him he hasn't done anything to work on this though. He recently tried one more time to see a therapist and once again gave up after 1 appointment and said he doesn't feel like going to therapy right now.\n\nI'm feeling really down because despite verbal assurances that he will give me, and the genuine love that I think he does have for me, I'm not convinced it'll ever happen. It makes me feel like I'm not good enough. It makes me feel embarrassed to be so excited and so sure about wanting to settle down with him, when he doesn't seem to see the same things in me, no matter how hard I try. \n\nI joined a new social group recently and this guy there had a quick and definite crush on me and started flirting with me a bunch. I haven't done or said anything untoward, but I've found myself thinking about it a whole lot. The attention made me feel this combination of electrified and depressed. I didn't realize how bad my self-worth had gotten because of how my relationship has been playing out. I forgot that I'm actually someone people want to date, and the attention really flattered me, but it's kind of breaking my heart that my boyfriend doesn't seem to appreciate me. \n\nI just feel like at this point in our lives it shouldn't be so hard to figure this out. I feel like if he was that into the idea of being with me long term, if it was actually important, he would have lifted a finger once sometime during an 18 month period to work on this, right? \n\nHow patient would YOU be before giving up? I don't even know how to start a conversation with him about this anymore. I would love to try to explain how I'm feeling and work it out, but not sure he'd be able to truly hear me. From his perspective the relationship is fine. \n\nHe's a great person and my best friend, but I deeply yearn to feel like I'm with a partner who is really choosing me. I think there have been some stretches where I felt angry, like it was unfair, but right now I just feel... sad.",

        "text": "So I met a guy, Paul, on a dating app. We've only been on 3 dates so far and he's already met my sister and brother in law when we wen to our 2nd date. I was downtown with him, my sister invited us over if he was comfortable with that and he was. I'm completely smitten with him, as he is to me. He doesn't \"love bomb\" me, but he continuously says very sweet things to me everyday. I haven't met someone from a dating app (and I'm a professional serial app dater) that I've ever ever liked this much in years, none of them have made it to the 3rd date.\n\nMy sis and Bil really like him too. My Bil makes good money, and when Paul told him what he does for a living, they talked excitedly about their careers together. When Paul went to the bathroom my Bil and sis looked at me kinda shocked and said \"I don't know if you know but Paul makes A LOT of money\", which I didn't really know, but I knew from his job title he probably makes decent money. Anyway, that's not why I'm smitten with him.\n\nI get super self conscious with men who make serious money, and by extension handsome and likeable and as nice like Paul. I know they can have anyone they want, so why me?\n\nThis anxious feeling heightened because of the character traits Paul said he USED to go after. (we asked each other these types of questions on our most recent date). The traits he \"used\" to sought after for were -\n\n- Ambitious with a good job *I am not the most career ambitious, and I don't have a good job. I work from home for basically a call center like type of place and I make 1 dollar over minimum wage. I've always been self conscious about careers and jobs because I can never seem to land in a \"good\" job that pays more than minimum wage, while all my friends make really good money with good careers. He said he was the type that wanted to be a \"power couple with someone\" but now sees that's ridiculous*\n\n- A nice big well rounded family. *I don't have basically any family whatsoever apart from my sister and brother in law. My mom died, and my dad is an alcoholic who I don't speak to anymore, and I don't have much of an extended family either. Also My childhood growing up was anything but \"well rounded\"*\n\nI kinda forget what the others were but those two were the ones that stood out to me. He already knows of my job, and my family life and while he says he's stopped caring about those things a while ago, it still stung to hear, I've always been self conscious of these, but it's like it's now proven I had a right to be self conscious about it. I am pretty much nothing he \"used\" to go for. I live in a shitty small bachelor in a bad part of town, and I don't have a car, and I pretty much just have nothing to show for my years on this earth. I'm afraid his old preferences will creep back up, and he'll realize those are a deal breaker for him again. Honestly the only good traits about me are I'm conventionally attractive, can be funny, and outgoing and I'm \"strong and independent\" I guess. Which if I didn't have any of these, there's absolutely no reason for him to stick around. \n\nHe also asked me how I deal with confrontation and arguments in a relationship and if I get mad easily. Which, yes, I do! My ex boyfriend was very verbally abusive and mean and he would legitimately bring the demon out of me. I discovered rage deep inside me I never knew existed, and it's almost like that rage stuck with me now. And while I lied and said a generic, girl next door answer to not seem psycho - I'm now trying with all my might to not get mad, at all, at anything.\n\nI don't know what to do. While this all hasn't seemed to scare him away yet, because he wants to take me out to a \"nice dinner\" this weekend, I feel like he needs to find someone who matches his level in life. I'm scared he'll realize I'm not actually all that worth it, and decide to ghost me or say it's not working out. I know this is definitely a me problem probably and one I need to fix. And I know it's only been 3 dates, but I'm not getting any younger. \n\nIf anyone has advice or in a similar situation, let it all out!",

        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI would really love your inputs on this, because I'm not sure if I'm being super judgmental, if I'm too close to the situation, or if something is wrong that I really can't see.\n\nI've been with my SO (33y) for almost 3 years. His sister (37y) is voluntary unemployed for the last 1 and a half years, as in, \"*I quit my job and I have no clue what I'm gonna do with my life*\".\n\nSince I've been with him, she only managed to work \"seriously\" for a couple of months. Most of the time, she was at home in layoff due to COVID and then just quit her job in 2021.\n\nAll of her life she worked jobs that aren't qualified (keep in mind she has a degree), but the history she tells is always the same: She can't find anything she likes. Stays at the jobs for a very short time (months). She gets quickly fed up with everyone, her boss, her colleagues, the clients, etc.\n\nWhen she quit in 2021, I thought it was a great idea, honestly: she could have the chance to find herself, do some inner work, find a new job, spend some time learning new skills, I mean: it's really a dream, right? You get the chance to do anything you want towards a life you want to build.\n\nSo it has been almost 1 and a half year and she haven't done... anything. She just spends her time home, doing nothing. She doesn't wanna spend time learning a new language. Learning a new skill. Learning ANYTHING new. She can't even barely function with a computer.\n\nThis woman has 37 years old, no kids, no partner, still lives with her parents, doesn't have an income.  No plans on leaving her parents house - none, whatsoever.\n\nWhen we try to make some conversation with her to see what motivates her, both me and our friends, one of two possible things happen: she gets super defensive or she just says \"I don't know what I'm gonna do, I'll see someday, etc.\".\n\nHer attitude is driving me insane, and I'm not even sure why. I mean, probably I do. I would die to have the opportunity to take a license to just travel, learn a new language, learn a new skillset, something new, something refreshing. I work 50+ hours a week, my SO also the same. I have a side gig to sell some stuff online, I try to learn new languages, I bust my ass off working, we're trying to buy a house, we're suffering with the housing prices, inflation, cost of living, and this attitude really itches me. I don't know what she's doing with her life. She seems like a spectator to every single problem an adult lives these days.\n\nMy in-laws don't even have the guts to face her. They are not super comfortable with the situation, but since they kinda suffer from empty nest, I think having her around is a way of having some company. But I mean, we're talking about a woman who is almost 40 years old.\n\nI really, really, try to be understanding. But I mean. Aren't people around her basically cuddling her attitude? I totally understand that it's not my place to even suggest what other people do with their lives, I know it, but we're talking about a person who has every time in the world to figure out what to do with her life.\n\nMost recent episode:\n\nShe's about to celebrate her birthday and was planning a birthday gathering with some friends &amp; close family. No one can make it, because... well, people have lives to live and most of the people are working, with kids, already outside the city. She busted in tears because no one can attend and bluntly refuses to celebrate her birthday on another weekend and just wants to cancel everything out in spite.\n\nI'm really speechless with her attitude. I can't stand the cuddling people do around her, like avoiding talking about the subject. Should I be worried this woman is depressed? Am I being super judgmental of her? Should we do something as a family?\n\nWe have the most opposite personalities and this only makes me avoid her, because there's no subject when she's around. Every time the group decides to talk about friendships, kids, partners, gym, I mean, whatever subject that comes into the talking, she just doesn't have any conversation to fill out. She's actively avoiding LIFE. I already said to her brother, she should get a job. She would take her mind out of this need that she has with everyone. Meet new people. Make money. Learn new things. But he's very protective of her and I can't say anything to him because he always makes it seem like I'm against her.\n\nProbably this is a vent mixed with being fed up with her attitude, with a mix of being worried.",

        "text": "This is long but I think the details are important when it comes to the deciding factor. \n\nFor starters, back in 2012 I met my now husband online. He was in Arizona and I was in New Mexico where I was temporarily living with my parents. They had moved to New Mexico in 2004. My sister was living back in Dallas where we grew up. So I moved to Arizona to be with my husband and his daughter whom he had shared custody with. It was pretty perfect situation especially since my parents were just a drive away to Nee Mexico.\n\nFast forward to 2016, I get pregnant and my sister gets pregnant. My parents decide to move back to Dallas. I don’t know what it was but becoming a mother myself and suddenly having my sister become a mother as well and then having my parents move states away, tore me up. I suddenly desperately wanted to be near my family. It is now 2023 and the pain is still very much there. My day to day life in Arizona is comfortable enough. I have a good job and am almost finished with post grad school certifications to get an even better job. My son has a nice community of support. My husband has 3 brothers, two of whom live nearby. His mother is lovely and lives nearby as well. However, the city we live in has never felt like home. I’ve never felt settled and cozy and complete here.\n\nHis daughter is now a sophomore in high school and my son is at the end of his first grade year. My husband is definitely interested in moving to Dallas. It’s a cool city, it’s my hometown, my husband and my parents get along really well. My niece and son were born a week apart yet have only seen each other in person a handful of times. They love each other, though. My son does have cousins in Arizona that live nearby but they are not close as both that are around his age have developmental disabilities that have gotten in the way of forming close bonds. \n\nMy husband has always agreed to move to Dallas once his daughter goes to college, which will be in more or less two years. \n\nPart of me is scared to death of moving and ruining what I would consider to be a very comfortable situation for my little family. My son is very sensitive and severely ADHD and we have managed to carve out an excellent community of support around us. He loves his school, has an amazing doctor and many best friends. \n\nBut it kills me inside knowing that he continues to grow up without my parents. And that they are growing older. I know time is limited and I feel a very strong need to be with them and my sister and her family. \n\nMy biggest fear in moving is having my husband resent me or “ruining” my son all because I want to be near my family and my hometown. However, I know that I have been living away from them for over 10 years now. \n\nThe only real plus in moving would be so I could be with my parents before they die, also so I can be closer to my sister and so our kids, who are both only children (except for my son’s half sister who is 10 years older than him), can build a relationship and be a family together. If something should happen to me and or my husband, I would want my son to have family he can count on nearby… and that would be my sister and her family. But for some reason I also feel like the move would be really selfish on my part? Should I just get over that? \n\nThe biggest negative is the huge transition of it all, and the rebuilding of a community for my son.\n\nBoth the thought of moving and the thought of not moving send me into anxiety. This has been going on for over 6 years now. \n\nAm I idealizing the idea of living near my family? Would I be moving just because I miss them? I have so many worries and questions. \n\nHave any of you ever been in a similar situation? Any thoughts or advice?",

We were only together for about 6 months.We had a good discussion about the breakup, and at the end of the discussion we both agreed we were still on good terms to restart as platonic friends later.\n\nI asked to go no-contact for a couple months before we saw each other again, and the end of the no-contact period is coming up sort of soon--so I'm wondering, is it worth reaching out again after no-contact ends to actually try being friends? I've been through a couple of other breakups where the \"we can still be friends\" discussion happened, and in those cases it didn't really feel worth reaching out again after some time had passed. I think this case feels different to me because we were legitimately friends beyond being romantic partners. \n\nSo... advice from any of y'all with a little more life experience than I have? Happy stories where truly platonic friendship worked out after dating?",

Basically, that is someone you act like a big sister to, help with the transition of being freshman in college and joining the sorority. She would have the habit of when getting mad at me sending me long text messages about how I have hurt her and really negative things about myself. It wasn't only me she did this to be but several other friends she lost because of this. Basically, I describe these text she knows were to stab you then twist the knife while pointing out traits she feels are negative or how she felt you wronged her. I stayed friends with her despite of this well into my later 20's. In 2020 during the pandemic I found out my partner of six years had a girlfriend for five years of are relationship, but she was in college in Austin, Texas so his once a month work trips he told me were mandatory were to visit her. Jane during this time and I got in a fight, because she let it slip my partner that cheated used to text her about me ALL THE TIME. He also would share secrets I told him with her. I was mad and told her through text a few day later I was really upset about this. She then sent me basically four page text about how horrible I am, how all her friends dislike me and all her family. She then called me a user and really mean things like that. My mental health was really bad finding out my partner was in a double life. I texted her that I had great memories with her, but this time in my life I feel like our relationship isn't needed. Then I blocked her. Three years later I am not engaged in a happy relationship. One of our mutual friend that is bridesmaid told me this weekend Jane, called her talked to her for two hours saying how much she missed me, saying she was in bad place took her anger out on me that night, and asking about my wedding. She stated Jane wanted to me my friend again. I really don't know what to do. Any advice",

        "text": "I made a new friend in the last couple of months, and felt like I was a great friend to her. She has a lot of struggles that are objectively difficult and if people knew what she was dealing with, I know a lot of men would not be interested in her. So I understand she feels insecure about this, and she's friends with me, someone who gets interest from men (as opposed to someone who maybe never gets approached). I feel that maybe it's become difficult for her, because I've been talking to someone over the last couple of weeks and she was aware that there was sort of something brewing between us. It did not stop her from flirting heavily and from trying to get attention from him in gimmicky ways though. \n\nIt culminated in me having a conversation with her about my feelings last week. I made it clear that I was developing feelings for him, and then I mentioned that she had made comments about competing with friends for men (not even fully a joke, I think she was half serious) and stuff like that. I think the first time I really hung out with her, it was semi evident we had different tastes in men and she went \"ok good, we can be friends then\", which was funny but weird to me at the time. I chose to brush past that. \n\nDuring the conversation I had with her last week, I mentioned my feelings about him. Her response (not the first time she has said it) is \"it's a numbers game/he has the right to talk to many women just as you have the right to talk to many men\", which... ok? That isn't relevant. She then said \"well I mean about me - I need to put myself out there\"... ok, again, not about me and him? I then straight up asked if she would flirt with a guy her friend likes. She said no, but she had been doing that in this case. I thought we resolved things because she said she respects friend's feelings so I trusted her and left it at that. I then hung out with her and said guy the next day and she proceeded to lay it on thick with him the entire day. There was one distinct time where he and I finally got a moment where we were side by side, and he fixated on me and she seemed *bothered* by this and kept trying to mention things to get his attention (things she knew he liked). The reason I got annoyed with her the entire day was because she kept saying things like this (stuff she knew would get his attention but she rarely/never mentioned around me) and because she seemed so annoyed/bugged that he was looking at me/talking to me. It just feels bizarre to me. She even made remarks that insinuated that she was bothered/annoyed... the rest of the day, she also tried to walk by his side but seemed to have ditched me, which is weird again. It felt like she was also lit up by attention from him too, so she just mainly tried to make conversation with him all day. \n\nHonestly, after seeing this in her (again), I kept it very cordial with her and superficially friendly but observing this among the previous comments she's made has made it clear that she will do *anything* for male attention (because of her valid/objective insecurities) and it makes me worried she's willing to throw me/any woman under the bus for this. And it makes me uncomfortable, I really look for confident and uplifting friends, I don't \"compete\" with my friends. I haven't had a follow-up conversation with her because I felt like *one* conversation about it was enough, but she really disrespected that conversation via her actions so it makes me wonder if it's even worth it to give it a second shot. It also makes me think she also invalidated me in that conversation with her \"it's a numbers game\" response too. I think it's a loss of trust issue for me, maybe a difference in values as well. \n\nWhat would you do? What do you do in these cases? I have a regularly planned hangout with her every week and honestly I don't even want her around at this point, but I also want to handle it maturely.",

        "text": "I've had a lot of arguments with my husband over the years about how inconsiderate he is when I sleep. I dont yell, but this has caused me to yell on multiple occasions. I dont know what to do. He makes a lot of noise and is just very inconsiderate when I'm sleeping. Ive gotten a bigger bed, I taught him how to close doors so he's not slamming them, I got a cat feeder (the cat would meow at 5 am and he would chase her down the stairs and make a shit ton of noise - after we got the feeder she stopped meowing. i had to change the cats behavior to change his), I've taught him how not to jump in the bed like a giant gorilla at 3 am and so on. \n\nLast night I got woken up at 12:30 by something. He was still up. I asked him not to move or go anywhere because I needed to get back to sleep. He said he needs to get up to go to the washroom and to go get the blanket out of the dryer. He goes to the washroom every hour so I know he didn't have to go. I also don't understand why all the sudden he needed a blanket when I said no. Ive never asked him to do this after getting woken up. This has been the only time after being woken up that I asked him to stay put. I have epilepsy and my seizures are triggered by lack of sleep, stress and getting woken up. I get auras or warnings before I get a seizure. I dont know if I was having a full blown aura last night or just some regular anxiety. I didn't communicate to him that I was feeling an anxious,but he saw me take my anti seizure medication. I dont communicate with anyone that im going to have a seizure unless I'm \"at the point of no return\". Saying or thinking that its going to happen causes more stress and anxiety. In some cases I can stop a seizure with meds and calm breaths. I just want him to fucking listen for once about the sleep thing without it being an issue. Its a medical issue just fucking listen. Thankful I didn't have a seizure last night but im SO hurt. I broke down crying when I saw him this morning and haven't been able to talk to him. \n\nThis was a one off thing with me asking him not to move. Theres been so many occasions with just waking me up because he's being inconsiderate or doesn't know how to not be an ogar. Ive been seizure free for years and he's never seen me have a seizure. If I get a seizure I lose my drivers license for a year, my job and I have to increase my meds. I also may have to get surgery again (I dislocated both my shoulders from seizures in the past and had to get surgery on both of my shoulders and if I dislocate them again from seizures they'll have to cut out my hip bone to replace the shoulder). Maybe last night was a miscommunication thing but its triggered so many feelings of him being inconsiderate over the years and all the friggen arguments. My husband is a very compassionate person but with this one thing it just doesn't seem to click.\n\nTldr; husband wakes me up and has been inconsiderate and behaves like a toodler stomping around at night. I have health issues relating to sleep. Hes gotten better but we still have issues. How do I get through to him to take my sleep seriously ?",

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nSorry in advance for the guy-related post. I know there are much more important things you could be reading about, but I need to get this off my chest.\n\nToday I (30 F) was randomly daydreaming at work (procrastinating lol) and realised something - I've never had the experience of sleeping with someone who actually cares about me. \n\nAs a bit of background, I've never been in a committed relationship. Currently, I have maybe 3 guys I sleep with semi-regularly - including one I've been sleeping with for 2+ years. The closest I've had to a relationship was a 10-month situationship where I'm not sure either of us truly cared about each other (we mutually ended it). I go on first dates quite frequently and recently, most of them have been pretty mediocre - they're either followed by a mutual fade, or I reach out and then it's like pulling teeth trying to line up a second date. So my current situation is me sleeping with these 3 guys who are using me for sex until someone better comes along. Of the 3 guys, I'd consider taking it further with 2 of them, but it's clear they're not interested in me that way (I haven't broached the subject with them but it's obvious, e.g., they're seeing other people and/or have made it clear they want to keep things casual).\n\nFor the most part, I love being single and doing what I want, when I want. Practically speaking, I think I'd really struggle with compromise in a relationship because I've spent so much time on my own and am pretty set in my ways. I just feel sad that it seems like I'll never have a truly intimate relationship and that all I seem to be good for is no-strings-attached sex.\n\nI see other women post about their bad luck on the dating scene so I know I'm not the only one. However, it seems that the key difference between myself and most others is that most people have been in a loving relationship before, even if it didn't end well. I haven't had that and it makes me feel like I'm broken - because I don't have that \"evidence\" that I'm loveable. I've never even had a guy text me with any frequency or tell me they like me. I think on paper I'm okay (have a PhD, good job, fit (I'm a runner), have been told I'm attractive). But I feel like there must be something wrong with me and people aren't telling me what it is. I'd feel more optimistic about dating with some relationship history behind me - it's getting to the point where I'm even becoming jealous of women who were in relationships that ended badly (at least they had someone love them, for the most part - and yes, I know how bad that sounds).\n\nFull disclosure, I do have some issues that I'm working through in therapy (e.g., mentally ill mother / alcoholic father who basically cut off contact with me after he had a fight with my brother 3 years ago). When I told my therapist I'd never been in a relationship he thought the problem was that I'm not putting myself out there and opening myself up to potential rejection, but clearly I am. (side note: I'm trying to find a different therapist after I realised he spent 80% of our sessions talking about himself or Jordan Peterson).\n\nFor those who've never experienced love and/or have never had someone be in love with them, does it make you sad? I just want to have that experience and not feel like a discarded piece of rubbish every time I have sex. :( On a related note, how can I muster up the self-control to break off the 2-year thing? I don't think it's doing any good for me but it's like I'm addicted to the temporary highs.",

I get that they feel heartbroken to have lost their life partners and needed to transfer &amp; replant their attention/love somewhere else, aka rebound.  But I can't explain why it bothers me so much.  I feel disappointed, a bit angry, and hopeless - that the husbands you and I are married to today will belong to another woman one day in the future and he'll be having sex with her instead of me (yes, I know because I'd be dead by then).  I know... rationally speaking... remarrying is very common, and we are humans, we are social animals, we need the companionship. We can't own our husbands forever.  They have the right to move on.  I know I know how to say all these reasons with my mouth.  But my heart aches that the reality is my husband will #$%&amp; someone else one day if I died first, which might be quite likely because I've been experiencing many health problems.",

        "text": "My husband and I eloped last year as our friends and family are scattered all around the world. A month after we eloped, we travelled back to my hometown and had dinner with my 4 closest friends and their husbands/partners. This was the first time we had all gathered since the pandemic and it was the first time most of them were meeting my husband. I considered these 4 women my closest friends who I have known for almost 2 decades, although I had been living overseas away from them for the past decade.\n\nTowards the end of dinner, my friends surprised us with a cake to celebrate our elopement. During dessert, conversation turned to reminiscing about what I was like as a teenager and in my early-mid 20s. It quickly turned into what felt like a \"roast\". Instead of sharing heartwarming or silly and slighly embarrassing memories, it felt like every single dumb and the most embarrassing things I did were brought up for everyone to laugh at. Most of them involved me and alcohol (I used to drink and party a lot when I was younger and was admittedly \"a messy drunk\"). In my mind, it really crossed the line from teasing to a drawn-out cruel roast. I tried to laugh it off at first and change the topic, but it just kept going and going for what felt like 20 minutes and in the end, I just shut down from shock at what was happening. A lot of the memories they brought up were incredibly personal and were honestly some of the most embarrassing moments of my life. These were private memories shared between best friends from many years ago, and I was in disbelief they were saying this in front of my husband who they were meeting for the first time. I felt really ganged up on in that moment and like they were revelling in swapping stories and painting me as this idiotic drunkard when I have always gone above and beyond for our friendship and showed nothing but loyalty and love to them.\n\nAfterwards, I sent them a message to say that I was really hurt over what happened. They all immediately apologized and said it was not their intention to hurt my feelings. After that, I've had no contact with them for over 6 months, apart from when they sent me birthday messages.\n\nIn the past few months, I have really tried to work through my feelings but I have been unable to \"let it go\" and move on. A few weeks ago, I sent them all a long message. In it, I told them I would be expecting my first baby and also told them that I was still incredibly hurt, angry, and confused at what happened that night. I wrote that what happened deeply broke my trust in our friendship. I said I really missed them so much, but that I needed to take a step back from our friendship as I don't have it in me right now to emotionally engage with and process what happened. I wrote that I will feel ready to reconnect later on once more time has passed and the dust settles and that I hope they will want to reconnect as well.\n\nAfterwards, one of them blocked me from all social media. I feel like that was her way of saying she never wanted to reconnect with me ever again. This has really compounded the hurt as I had always considered her my closest friend. It's also really confused me because why is she getting angry at me when I'm expressing that their actions really hurt and upset me and that I still needed time to process?\n\nI guess I'm looking for some outside perspective on this. Am I being unreasonable in this whole thing? Is there even any chance in salvaging my friendship with the one who blocked me?",

I have a few friendship groups who were always the beer and burger at a pub, or bbq at home types, but I have a few other that are very much the elaborate restaurant and alcohol order types where the bill is always split equally (e.g., an dinner for three last week between share plates, cocktails and sparkling water was over $300) - I have 4 of these groups who I catch up with 6 times a month between them and I just cant do this type of spending anymore. I suspect there is no one else in the groups with this issue, they're all high income earners 180K +\n\nSo my question is how do I navigate this discussion I obviously need to have?\n\nIt is pretty vulnerable to say, hey guys, I cant do this anymore, do you want to go to a pub or have a dinner party instead. I am also conscious that this is a me issue, and should not impact a whole group. But I would like to try and maintain these friendships - and these are the only catch ups happening. I feel like a middle ground would be to no longer split the bill and people pay their own (that way I could order an standard meal and couple of wines for $50) - but culturally thats not really how things go in these circles. \n\nAny advice? Has anyone navigated this successfully?",

        "text": "Months ago I had a feeling I was going to run into an ex bf. I posted on here and I got great advice to write down my feelings,  etc. \n\nI did and... I also ran into him at the supermarket.  \n\nWe have ran into each other about 5x in 20 years. His go-to move is to pretend he didn't see me, and he did his go-to move.\n\nAnyway, the other morning, I was thinking about how he's still such a coward to not even acknowledge me 20 years later. I saw him, and i saw him turn around. I stared at him, and he even looked back and turned down the aisle. \n\nI didn't realize it was a messy break up.  I didn't even know how messy our relationship was until about a year after we broke up, and I found out he was cheating the last few months of our relationship. He had the nerve to tell me that he wished he could marry me the night he broke up with me.  (Not the first time he told me he wanted to get married)\n\nAnyway, the other morning I was thinking about him and how it truly bothers me that he ignores me.  My apple speaker started playing music randomly. (Freaked me out a little) The song \"someone that I used to know\" came in on.  The song lyrics fit so perfectly. Tonight I saw a commercial for a movie \"someone that I used to know\".  I am going to watch it tonight. \n\nI mentioned that the song came on and that the movie came up on the TV as an ad to my husband. He said,  \"You're going to run into ex again\"\n\nI'm so tired of the pretending that he doesn't know me. We dated for a couple of years. I was friends with him for years prior to that.\n\nI'm so over him.... he truly is \"someone I used to know\".  I don't know this man anymore after 20+ years. We both have families, and I adore mine. I DL hope he's not as happy as I am. But can't we all be a little petty. \n\nBut why the signs???  And where to post if not here?   I looked on reddit for signs and it was actual signs 🤣",

Sometimes I'd get frustrated and say bye and vice versa. It finally came out today that he stopped being attracted to me, god knows how long ago, and was playing the role to keep me around. \n\nWe saw each other 2x this week, so I asked, \"So you used me this week?\" And he said, \"I like the sex, sorry. Or sex in general.\" So, yeah, fuck him. \n\nI lost my job and was behind on back rent, so he loaned me money and I still owe him about $500. Do I pay it back? Morally I feel like I should, but he's well off and doesn't need it, and also. Fuck. Him.",

I just want to sit in silense and contemplate life in perfect solitude. I'm struggling with asking for it without being snappy because he feels that him being in his office at night should suffice, and it doesn't. \n\nMy next step is to buy a cabin in the woods so I can be alone one day per week, but that seems a little extreme. And expensive. \n\nAre there any other more constructive ideas? How do you do it?",
