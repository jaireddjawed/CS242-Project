        "title": "Linux — namespaces: PID namespace",
        "author": "boutnaru",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/11ct2l7/linux_namespaces_pid_namespace/",
        "text": "In  the first part of the series we have talked generally about what are  namespace and what we can do with them — in case you want to go over it  you can use the following link [https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-namespaces-part-1-dcee9c40fb68](https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-namespaces-part-1-dcee9c40fb68). Now we are going to deep dive into pid namespaces.\n\nThe  goal of PID namespaces is to isolate the “Process ID number space”.  Thus, different processes in distinct PID namespaces can have the same  PID. When a new PID namespace is started the first process gets PID 1  (so we don’t have a new swapper — [https://medium.com/@boutnaru/the-linux-process-journey-pid-0-swapper-7868d1131316](https://medium.com/@boutnaru/the-linux-process-journey-pid-0-swapper-7868d1131316)). In order to use PID namespaces we have to ensure that our kernel was compiled with “CONFIG\\_PID\\_NS” enabled ([https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pid\\_namespaces.7.html](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pid_namespaces.7.html)).\n\nMoreover,  PID namespace can also be nested , since kernel 3.7 the maximum nesting  depth is 32. A process is visible to every other process in the same  PID namespace or any direct ancestor PID namespace. The opposite way  does not work, a process in a child PID namespace can’t see a process in  a parent PID namespace ([https://www.schutzwerk.com/en/blog/linux-container-namespaces03-pid-net/](https://www.schutzwerk.com/en/blog/linux-container-namespaces03-pid-net/)).\n\nAlso,  “/proc” will show only processes which are visible in the PID namespace  of the process that executed the “mount” operation for “/proc” ([https://lwn.net/Articles/531419/](https://lwn.net/Articles/531419/)).  If we want to see the number of the last pid that was allocated in our  PID namespace we can use “/proc/sys/kernel/ns\\_last\\_pid” ([https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/sysctl/kernel.html#ns-last-pid](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/sysctl/kernel.html#ns-last-pid)) — as you can see in the screenshot below.\n\nLastly,  a nice fact to know is that when we pass a pid over a unix domain  socket to a process which belongs to another PID namespace, it is  resolved to the correct value in the receiving process’ PID namespace ([https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pid\\_namespaces.7.html](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pid_namespaces.7.html)).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3u0yhsoynlka1.png?width=632&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0bf7cdb7d0d628e1f106f128c7da0650de7dda57",

        "text": "I was looking for a new distro for myself and was stunned by how few options there are, despite the fact, there's like a bazilion existing distros. Generally you can divide them into 4 categories:\n1. Ubuntu LTS/Debian based \"oldies\"\n2. Arch based \"bleeding edge\"\n3. Wacky enthusiast distros\n4. Fedora\n\nWhat do I mean by that? Well, basically every Ubuntu-based distro is using LTS edition, which is fine for the first few months, but as soon as new hardware arrives, and as time passes it works worse and worse, for example 22.04 is unusable for me on RX7900XTX, simply because drivers either don't work or crash all the times, reason beeing old libraries. There are SOME exceptions, that backport a lot, like Pop OS, but if you wand fairly recent versions and Ubuntu base - well, Ubuntu or nothing.\nOn the other end there are Arch based - and don't get me wrong, Arch is great. But you know how it's like with bleeding edge - it cuts you. So yes, recent, but not stable.\nAnd there are these wacky weird distros for absolute enthusiasts - Gentoo, LFS, Void, Solus. They are OK, but often don't have any suppory for hardware except bare minimum offered by LTS kernel.\nAnd there's Fedora - sharp edge, but still stable. But Fedora has its own problems I noticed by daily driving it for 2 years.\n\nSo there we are - if you want a distro, that is fairly recent in terms of packages, hardware support, but still stable you have Ubuntu non-LTS, Pop and Fedora. Am I weird, or is it just... Too few? Ultimately we want more people to start using Linux. And they won't if they have only 3 options. Cuz really - a casual user will just plunk distro in the drive, and if something like WiFi, GPU, Bluetooth won't work they'll just go back to Windows. \n\nAnd I know about Snaps and Flatpaks! But sorry - you wont provide Mesa, AMDGPU, NVidia or WiFi card drivers with Flatpak. This is the issue. \n\nSo yeah - more distros that are \"in between\" - recent but stable.",

I am told this is because Windows use commercial Dolby drivers not avialable for Linux. This may be true but then I need a laptop that either doesn't need drivers or provides drivers for Linux.   Suggestions about using external speakers or headphones are beside the point.\n\nBottom line is, I've accepted that this laptop isn't very useful for Linux, so my question is, what is?  Something similar - reasonable/similar CPU, 8GB RAM, 120-240GB SSD, decent screen.   I'm not going to use it for gaming so touchscreen or GPU is not a requirement.  Preferably solid.

While by default `/usr/local/lib` is in the library path, `/usr/local/lib/mylib`is not, and the library path is not searched recursively.   When I look at libraries installed by package managers, under `/lib` for instance, I see it is stored within a directory who has the name of the package-- for example `/lib/packagename/libraryname.so`.  Since these can be searched by the library path, my only conclusion is that the package manager modified my library path to include the `/lib/packagename` folder.   So here are my questions:  \n\n1) Is this what happens?  Does some script modify the library path when you install a package?\n\n2) How might I write a makefile script to modify the library path as well?  Other open source projects can be installed this way-- with `make install` rather than through a package manager-- so I figure there must be a way to do it.\n\nThank you!",

I run the linux-hardened kernel and changed a few parameters in a systemd-boot entry.\n\nHowever /proc/cmdline and sysctl show different results. My assumption is that the former shows only boot parameters and the latter runtime parameters. Is this correct?\n\nIs there a way to check the actually used kernel parameters on a running system resulting from all three methods of setting the parameters?\n\nWhat's the recommended way to set parameters? Via boot parameters or sysctl?",
