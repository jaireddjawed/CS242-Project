        "text": "I am mulling over senior project ideas now for my senior year in the Fall, and I have a few ideas that would be really fun. The difficult part for me is that while I want my senior project to blow employers away, I am still stuck in a cage of Dunning-Kruger effect (too uneducated to know how uneducated I truly am), and so I can't even tell what design details would get my project to a professional standard.\n\nThe two projects I have are as follows:\n\n1) Build underglow for my car, which reacts to turn signals, warning lights, and acceleration to control the bottom of the car's underglow while driving, and a sound sensor to make my underglow (and interior lights) \"dance\" to the music in my car. I want to use a touch LCD screen to control the whole array from the dash.\n\n2) Build a remote-control car which can run through a course drawn in chalk. I want to make it capable of running the course using the absolute fastest possible route available, then I want to make it capable of racing on the course with another human-controlled car. I'll probably change settings to allow difficulty settings for the user.\n\nI actually made a lot of the first project just before my Sophomore year in college, just using an Arduino and a bunch of breakout sensors I found online. What scares me is that I could do it as a freshman, so why would it be cool to do it as a senior! I'm trying to really wow people. Should I make these projects more difficult for myself by building them with more difficult platforms such as FPGA's or BASYS3 microcontrollers (the kind which don't use libraries to skip over all the nitty-gritty of the boards) or force all the computing of the RC car to stay onboard so that space and weight is a constraint? Or should I move the goalposts, maybe by making the underglow also have a voice-control key-fob which sends signals to the car from long distances, or make the RC car capable of determining the best way to complete the course without any prior mapping whatsoever and make it capable of threading through obstacles which are randomly dropped on the course without warning?\n\nFor all I know these ideas could be barely enough to not look dumb to my interviewers, and I need a new route to take. I know this is very broad, but I could use all the help I can get. What do you think?",

Got interviewed for a Design Automation role that works on CAD tools, uses SV, UVM etc. What are the chances I would be able to switch to a design role in the near future through this Automation role? Would it be a wise decision to switch roles frequently? I want to stay in HW and work on IPs at depth, will I be straying farther away from design if I take up this role?",

I've been told at my company, beyond moving to a senior signal design engineer there is no more vertical movement for this career path.\n\nI would like to ask others who have been in this field how they were able to progress their careers (conventional or otherwise), some of the steps taken, be it specific experiences or schooling, or if they transferred industries and how? I would love to hear the experiences of as many people as I could and talk to as many as I could and I figured this sub would be the best place to do so.\n\nThanks!",

I'm really living in a dilemma where I can't decide between a career in semiconductors or cybersecurity. On one hand, working in semiconductors with a PhD (which I may end up doing) is a high end career with a very few amount of people with this background, basically it's world class difficulty not everyone can pull it off. However on the other hand, Tech is still to this day the hottest field out there with insane salaries, remote work etc., and frankly I see *not so skilled individuals* having lots of success in Tech in a relatively very short amount of time after only a BSc in CS or even without any degrees. In addition, almost every EE,ME even Civil engineer are breaking into Tech jobs right after graduating. Is it possible for me to have a normal EE job in a company while doing part-time cybersecurity on the side? I really want to have my own company one day and honestly I'm slightly leaning towards cybersecurity for now but I need to hear some opinions first maybe I can learn something new or someone can highlight another thing for me I wasn't really aware of.

My questions are as follows:  \n\n\n* As I understand from the documentation, switch position can be set separately for AC, DC, IC and Transient analysis. \n* I have an xf and ac analysis setup in ADE Assembler for the OPAMP. While all the switch positions are set to 1, my simulation results are as expected. However, when I change the DC position to another value (let's say for DC analysis it is set to 2), my xf and ac analysis results are skewed. DC analysis switch position affects the outcome of these tests, even though there is no DC analysis setup in the ADE Assembler.\n* What am I missing for the switch functionality? Why does my xf and ac analysis do not hold with different DC analysis switch positions?\n\nAny help and info about this would be really appreciated.",

I read low resistance across transformer input wires, so no continuity but across the output it shows continuity and since I don't work with transformers often I wanted to make sure this is correct.",

I have worked primarily with the TM4C123GH6PM with an ARM Cortex M4 so that is what I am comfortable with thus far. My plan is to use it mainly for guitar so a single channel, 16 bit, 32kHz sample rate is the minimum requirements. An ADC and DAC peripheral would be ideal of course.\n\nAs of now I do not plan to store any samples in memory. I hope to compare the current signal to a threshold and compress the signal by a ratio if it is above, then output that value and discard it. My main issue is processing speeds and peripheral inclusion. \n\nIf anyone has suggestions of an external IC for ADC or DAC that would work with the TM4C123GH6PM that would be appreciated as well.",

Thank you so much in advance to whoever reads and can help\\*\n\nMy situation might be unique, but I'm sure it's not uncommon.\n\nI'm employed full-time and my lifestyle currently allows me to enroll in part-time education. Throughout my career, I've been enrolled starting with Electrical Engineering online (with Arizona State University) then I transferred to the University of Arizona to major in Electrical and Computer Engineering (Computer Engineering track). However, I wasn't able to progress with Arizona's online degree plan they set for me, and because I was enrolled in the pre-engineering program (which they unfortunately removed spring 2023 semester), I'm in a bit of a dilemma.\n\nI researched other universities that look credible to offering an online Bachelor's of Science in Computer Engineering and the options are severely limited. The only other university I came across is FIU (Florida International University). I applied and was accepted, but I was approved for their Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science (because I haven't completed Calculus I). The highest math I've completed was College Algebra, so the next class I will need to take is Pre-Calculus.\n\nI hope what I described above makes sense so far.\n\nI've attended college in the past, but it was a technical college where I earned an Associate of Science in IT. The end goal with my Computer Engineering degree pursuits is to return to a university as a full-time student and earn my bachelor of science degree in Computer Engineering.\n\nThe caveat is I'm on a contract with my career and I cannot just quit my job and leave to enroll in college full-time. There are options and programs where I can do that, but I'm trying to be proactive when I return to school full-time to ease the course load.\n\nThat being said, would it be a good idea to temporarily enroll in an online bachelor of science in Computer Science to eventually transfer to a university in-person and finish my bachelor of science in Computer Engineering?\n\nI'm thinking maybe if I can complete the Computer Science classes as an online student and then finish the Electrical Engineering side in-person to factor in the labs and projects.\n\nTL;dr: is it a good idea to temporarily enroll in a B.S in Computer Science as an online student (due to limited ability for online CompEng), then enroll as a full-time student in-person to transfer to a B.S in Computer Engineering to finish the electrical engineering side of the Computer Engineering degree?",

But ultimately I want to move up the stack, do something regarding architecture design/systems level design. Is that a realistic outlook? Is it more common in the industry to be stuck at RTL design? I am concerned about this because I read in a few forums that it is near impossible to move into architecture without a related  PHD. Please share any advice or experience.",

        "text": "Hi\n\nI know this will probably be an easy question for most of you, but I have a question about coursework I have been given recently. I have been asked to create a mobile detector circuit that will detect an RF signal between 800MHz and 2.8GHz, and I cant seem to get the online examples to work on proteus. \n\nHere is my circuit:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3poiwapol3aa1.png?width=1045&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e9225282f6bff9908cce025cf7bcc005251d88c\n\nNo matter what I change the frequency to be on C1, the output is always about 0.65V. Changing RV1 doesn't make a difference to the output voltage either. \n\nIt's late for me and ive been writing up the work all day, so it might be something simple, but some help would be appreciated haha.\n\nThanks",

Is it merely the size of the blocks that are different? I assume the definition of the symbols within the blocks are different too?\n\nFor example, in PCIe 3/4/5, the TS1 blocks have some symbols for polling states, dc balance, EQ control. What about ethernet?",
