The excitement on my face when she dropped and I felt like a badass. I‚Äôm probably gonna make a save state to help people take her on. I think it‚Äôll be a very fun fight once I learn how to deal with her Waterfowl.\n\nBUT DUDE! IT TOOK ME FOREVER! IT WAS BADASS!",

I‚Äôll just be another nobody guy workin 9-5 who died. My diary would be considered so uninteresting it‚Äôd probably get thrown away.\n\nJust the thought of that makes me panic, i wish my parents had been more involved in my hobbies and made me take classes, if only my mother let me go on with my karate lessons or if they just taught me something sooner so that i‚Äôd be practicing it for a while now and would be pretty experienced at it.\nI feel as though i‚Äôve wasted my life being average and not knowing how to do anything and it hurts to know i won‚Äôt amount to much. \nI look at people like Sixto Rodriguez, Kurt Cobain, Malala, anyone really. People i follow on social media showing their amazing and breathtaking art, or their music or comics and i think to myself why can‚Äôt i be skilled enough to do that? Despite drawing for years i‚Äôm only decent enough to sketch some fun characters and my anatomy is nowhere near good enough to make a comic. I wrote many short stories and deleted them cause they seemed subpar.\n\nI will get told i‚Äôm too young to be pessimistic but i‚Äôm 19 and i see PRETEENS that skateboard better than me and i cannot even practice out of embarrassment as i don‚Äôt wanna be publicly humiliated. I practice tricks at home sometimes but stopped trying when i saw skaters on youtube pulling off god level stunts.\n\nComparing yourself to others is counterproductive i know but i feel useless. Everyone is so ahead and worlds of talent ahead of me that even if i got better at skating or drawing or even picked up the piano again i would be below average and would not make a mark.\n\nCan someone help me out‚Ä¶ how do i stop feeling like a pathetic loser amongst child prot√©g√©s..",

        "text": "I'm a teacher now, but some of the productivity advice I heard as a student (break things up into smaller tasks to avoid procrastination, do the most difficult task first, create a routine, etc.) simply do not work for some people. For instance, I can‚Äôt do the pomodoro technique or work in highly structured environments. It does not motivate me, and it makes work become even more of a chore.\n\nI also cannot reward myself to stay motivated. Perhaps it‚Äôs because I grew up in an abusive environment and was in a DV relationship for a while. I am used to feeling deprived of basic needs, so if I fail and don‚Äôt reward myself, it doesn‚Äôt have much of an effect because I am able to survive in that state of mind. If I do reward myself, I enjoy it, but I know the feeling of being in survival mode again, and I expect it. My mental state has actually improved a lot after being in therapy, and I don‚Äôt know how various techniques will be for me in the future, but I think my experiences now are worth mentioning.\n\nI have waves of productivity, and my work is much better when I am considering the tasks that I complete based on my mental state. It causes me less stress, which results in me being in a better mood and getting more done. When I‚Äôm forcing myself into a routine, I get more stressed, and that can cause me to burn out.\n\nI have tasks that are prioritized, and I also consider the difficulty of doing the task. If I‚Äôm in a bad state of mind, forcing myself to do a difficult task will be a grueling and unproductive process. If I do some of the easier tasks, I‚Äôll at least get those out of the way. And then the next day, I‚Äôll feel refreshed and ready to tackle the difficult task. If I‚Äôm in a bad enough mental state that I‚Äôm still not getting things done, maybe that‚Äôs a sign I need to take the day off work. I keep that open as an option. I‚Äôve done it occasionally, but most of the time, it ends up being unnecessary. But having that as an option relieves the stress, which helps tremendously.\n\nIf it‚Äôs at the point where I‚Äôm feeling like I need to keep taking time off work, that would mean I‚Äôd probably need to look into a career change. So I don‚Äôt stress myself out over it. I‚Äôll recognize that I‚Äôm struggling at the moment, and I have to do what I have to do, even if it means I end up quitting my job or something. Giving myself a little bit of space helps a lot, then I‚Äôm usually able to power through and get things done without work actually being affected.\n\nI also do not commit to one type of productivity tactic because my life is constantly fluctuating. If the productivity tactic you are trying to implement becomes stressful or anxiety-inducing, maybe you need to switch it up (even if you‚Äôve been doing this successfully before).\n\nI‚Äôm not saying this is a perfect system (deadlines do exist), but maybe it would be helpful for some people‚Ä¶I‚Äôve talked about it with students, and many of them found it very useful to hear this perspective. I tell them that it helped me to think about everything that would happen if I didn‚Äôt do well on an assignment. What options are there? List them all out. Even dropping out of college is an option, honestly. Failing at something is not the end of the world, even though it seems like it sometimes. Life is just a series of choices‚Ä¶I‚Äôve learned to recognize that I just may not be as productive as some people no matter what I do, and there‚Äôs no point in putting pressure on myself to perform at the same level. It‚Äôs not a weakness, it‚Äôs just that my brain does not want to function at that capacity, and that‚Äôs okay, honestly.\n\nI‚Äôm curious what works for other people, when it comes to productivity?",

In a lot of genres, covering music is looked down upon.\n\nI feel like this really misses out on the iterative process of music. And this is where I've come to really appreciate playing pop music as a classical musician. I don't always get to do vocal ensemble work as a classical musician so I have to venture out. If I want to work with other musicians and say rock for example, as a vocalist I'm expected tomorrow right by own songs. I'm not a lyricist. I really just want to practice the art of singing.\n\nEnter pop music. I would really like to think Bach Mass in b minor. Am I good enough to join a symphony inquire that is going to perform this piece? No. Pop music gives me the infrastructure to practice my basic musicianship and ensemble skills singing some Taylor Swift arrangement, well sign me up.\n\nHats off to you pop musicians.",

I wanted to go completely off grid (excluding Whatsapp, Telegram etc). But at my workplace or when soeaking to friends, everyone uploads their lives on Insta. Went to a cafe? Had an impromptu meetup? Did an interesting thing? Everything was uploaded already. As a result, I tend to miss out on happenings. Like people come the next day and be like \"Did you see X went on a trek?\". At my workplace, I kinda feel irritated as I want to be completely professional. I'll friend a few people on insta (but before I leave the job Ig). \n\nI rarely check insta, and the only reason why I use it is because I might need it if I go on dates or need to exchange contact info.\n\nI get that sharing numbers with random people isnt safe  enough.  But, why do I need to have an active social media presence to prove that \"I have a life\"? I dont want my life to be on public. You want to know? Thats what dates or meetups are for. \n\nI meetup with friends, go to some places. Most of my days are meh. Kinda feel that insta has made conversations redundant. If I already reacted to your post with a fire emoji, why would I bother talking again? This became a ramble, but I'd like to know why you use social media. \n\nPS: Kinda inspired from the Social Dilemma documentary. (I have personally seen a prof discuss a social engineering research paper that mobilized opinions using weighted networks, and a complex set of matrix optimizations, so the movie hit home wven harder).",

Not to be gross, but I could shake out my hair and my arms would get tired long before the flaking stopped. Recently it seemed to take a turn for the worse and I vaguely assumed that my issue was a dehydrated scalp because it felt itchy and irritated. \n\n\nIn addition to just using head and shoulders I‚Äôve tried using stronger versions of these shampoos, shampooing more often, less often, washing my hair every day, less than every day, just using conditioner, silicon scrubs to help work in shampoo, cleaning my pillow case more often, and even a scalp pick to try and get rid of the build-up manually. All of these methods yielded little to no result, and I eventually had to try to stop thinking about it because I‚Äôd get so frustrated it would derail my day. I generally try to be a very hygienic person, and this felt like I was somehow doing something wrong but I couldn‚Äôt figure out what it was and it was driving me mad. \n\n(TW: slight grossness) \n\nI then stumbled on a r/YSK post that talked about how dandruff, in some cases, isn‚Äôt caused by dehydration, but by a kind of fungus that lives on the scalp. It isn‚Äôt obviously visible, so I hadn‚Äôt had reason to suspect something like that. \n\nNot only does the fungus like water, dehydrating your scalp indirectly, but in response the rate at which your scalp sheds its skin goes into overdrive to try and get rid of it. There‚Äôs a specific kind of medicated shampoo with an ingredient that directly addresses this issue. (This isn‚Äôt an ad or something so I won‚Äôt mention it here, but if you have the same problem and suspect it might be same issue you can DM me if you‚Äôd like). \n\nI started feeling hopeful because this was a possible cause of the issue I hadn‚Äôt been aware of before and that I could try to address. I ordered the shampoo, used it for the first time yesterday, left it the lather for several minutes and repeated, and I could almost cry. \n\nI‚Äôm almost certain that this fungal thing was the issue because this shampoo basically nuked my dandruff, almost over night. I know it‚Äôs a little early to be celebrating as if the problem is over, but this is far and away the most dramatic effect of any of my attempts, and I‚Äôm optimistic that I‚Äôve finally identified the issue and have an accessible solution.",

I was happy to help them as for some reason it did not trigger my social anxiety as I was speaking about a topic I was comfortable with.\n\nThroughout my life people would talk shit about her right in front of me. One day another girl I liked even told me to straight stay away from her. The shit talking was constant and endless. I felt a lot of people where jealous of her or something because uase she was so nice and happy all the time. \n\nAt the time, I never had the courage to step up for her as I too did not have anyone on my side. \n\nNext thing I knew I never saw her again. She was a nice girl, I hope she is doing well.\n\nEveryday‚Ä¶she would see me she would hug me. It made me uncomfortable as hell but I loved it.

We have some tall and skinny, some young people, we‚Äôre getting a lot more women in this field, but there‚Äôs such a huge number of us that are pudgy old bearded men who probably actually won‚Äôt retire.

I intend to stay at it myself. That may be why there‚Äôs so many that look the same. We all stick around long enough. Just like how some people‚Äôs pets start to look like their owners maybe. I don‚Äôt run into many former waterworks people, unless they‚Äôre retired, which seems to be rare, or those that worked for companies that treated them poorly. That‚Äôs also somewhat rare because they usually just find another company in the same field. \n\nI recommend it to anyone looking for a stable career.

Each time someone hit enter they thought they were the first person to say that. Even if you don't post it you probably thought the same thing (upvote). So if AI is just reading what people say and then responding with a randomized most popular answer or something like that, then that's all it could be.

But she would arrive fifteen to twenty minutes later than our agreed upon meeting time. Lunch at the cafe? She‚Äôd tell you she‚Äôll be there at noon, and show up at 12:20. I let her know many times that I don‚Äôt like waiting and that she could pick a time to meet that was based on her convenience - just that I would appreciate her being punctual. We typically met for lunch at the cafe or coffee in the break room - a few minutes walk from her desk. And yet, she‚Äôd make me wait. Eventually I lost interest in meeting her. I feel sad about it sometimes, though. She is otherwise so nice.",

How can you ever be satisfied if you're trying to chase a feeling no longer attainable to your grown up self ?",

Sometimes we think about grand plans but we often settle for simpler things, which is funny.  \n\nIt's interesting how we come to the realization that simpler activities can be just as, if not more, enjoyable than more elaborate ones. I also have to add the fact that we are more or less practical people.\n\nHowever, the day turned out to be quite eventful - my wife received and gave cookies at her office celebration, and I gave her a small basket with a flower and heart-shaped biscuit with a figure. We cherished this moment after I took her home from work. However, we failed to watch anything as we were too sleepy.\n\nI think that celebrating something does not have to be a big event, enjoying each other‚Äôs company can make it up for anything. Love can be expressed in simple ways.",
