        "text": "Hi! I am a MA student in Islamic studies and will have to start writing my thesis in February (20.000 words). I‚Äôve been struggling a lot with choosing a topic, narrowing this topic down and picking a methodology. \n\nSadly my supervisor is not that helpful. I have mostly excelled at essays but when having to conduct research for a thesis it‚Äôs like my brain blocks and I just do not get what is expected of me. My main problem seems to be that I tend to prefer writing about broader topics or phenomena instead of focussing on a very specific detailed issue.\n\nI also tend to write a lot about history, looking at secondary and primary sources, analysing these, scrutinizing them and comparing them to each other, to then in a more or less chronological way work up to the present and describe how I think we got to the present situation and how this historical context can inform us about the present. Because of this, usually my essays tend to have a very narrative style to them (I realize that I‚Äôm sometimes more of a storyteller then a researcher in this regard).\n\nBut while during my essays this approach never seems to fail, when it comes to doing research for a thesis it doesn‚Äôt seem to cut it. When I look at my classmates they all tend to have very specific topics with very detailed research questions such as ‚Äúwhat did *occurrence* mean for *group of people* in *country* in *specific time period*‚Äù.\n\nWhen looking at topics that I‚Äôm interested I struggle to make something that‚Äôs nearly as specific as that. I‚Äôm mainly interested in modern trends in Islam and some of the topics that have crossed my mind are:\n\n-The Influence of (online) Fatwa‚Äôs by Saudi religious institutions on the Islamic views of Muslims in the West\n\n-The Athari school of theology throughout the ages and it‚Äôs relation to (and difference from) ‚ÄúSalafism‚Äù, ‚ÄúHanbalism‚Äù &amp; ‚ÄúAhlul Hadith‚Äù\n\n-The relationship between the Western political ‚Äúright-wing‚Äù and Islamic thinkers\n\n-The changing perception of Sufism in the West from colonial times in the 19th century, to the 20th century to the contemporary age.\n\n-The influence of Guenonian Traditionalism on Sufism in the West\n\n-The Ulama-Umara division in Saudi-Arabia from its inception towards contemporary times.\n\nI have read MANY texts on all these topics and feel like I have a decent grasp but I just have no idea how to narrow them down. With almost all of these I would prefer a methodology where I begin with describing the topic in its historical context to then work my way up via textual analysis and primary sources to some sort of present day conclusion of what this phenomena is or means. \n\nHowever, my supervisor keeps saying that I‚Äôm thinking too broad, that I should specify things and that I should intend to analyze and not just to describe. But I feel like if I would for example talk about ‚Äúthe influence of fatwa by Saudi religious institutions on the Islamic views of Muslims in *one country* in *short span of years*‚Äù would make it very hard to get to 20.000 words plus that in many cases I think this amount of narrowing makes one significantly overlook the broader story (which I find so important to tell).\n\nMethodology wise I‚Äôm also struggling. Many classmates will go abroad for fieldwork, which I sadly don‚Äôt have the time or the money for. Others will use interviews etc. But I largely prefer textual research as opposed to quantitative research (as well as only having 4 months which might make finding enough interviewees quite difficult).\n\nQuite a long story but I feel really stuck and I hope that someone might be able to help me",

        "text": "Hello. I was in a toxic lab for over a year for my masters. I had spent thousands, my whole savings, on research for a funded project. Most of this was due to traveling. My PI told me I would be reimbursed, but I found out they denied any requests I made and threw all the receipts I had turned in. I posted about this situation in LabRats, another Reddit group: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/u60mqj/burned_out_over_toxic_lab/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button\n\nOn top of this financial strain, I was constantly threatened, belittled and emotionally abused by my PI. The experience was devastating as I ended up homeless for a few months. My PI knew that during this time my family had stopped supporting me financially and emotionally due to my gay identity, and my PI continued to put financial and emotional strain on me. I quit and reached out to many different resources on campus, but nothing was ever done. Finally months after, I emailed the president's office of the whole university and was able to receive some financial reimbursement back. \n\nI am currently in another lab at a different institution facing some of these issues again. I started a few months ago and was so honored and ecstatic to have another opportunity. I was brought on as a research assistant and would start my masters the following semester. However, the lab manager quit within a few weeks of me starting. As a result, I have become the defacto lab manager. This put my start date as a student on hold for now.. Which would be fine, but as soon as I assumed this role, the PI in this lab has began to treat me poorly. I am threatened and ultimately emotionally abused again. I am cursed at and told that I will be fired. I am getting things done and am also told by the PI that I am doing an amazing and great job, but there are times where the verbal assault occurs. When I was first threatened over the phone one night, I immediately reported it to HR. I was told I could either quit or have a meeting setup with the PI and HR. Obviously I cannot have the latter occur as thats a dead end option, so I have been applying to other jobs. I am just so heartbroken by both these experiences. I have tried to talk to the PI about this and it just ends up with me being yelled at and essentially bullied (I reported personal attacks that were said to HR). All I want is to be treated with respect and to be in an environment that facilitates science. I am so passionate about the subject and getting a masters is the best option for working in this field.\n\nIt just hurts deeply because along with family issues, I just can't seem to be respected. I don't know what to do now. I was thinking about working retail as a way of taking a break. I'm really just asking if anyone has suggestions or advice. I have always struggled standing up for myself and I am doing the most I have ever done for myself now. Thank you for your consideration and help.",

Do accommodation/meal grants (distinct from 'travel' grants) for winter/summer schools or workshops, as opposed to travel grants for research conferences qualify as an 'award' in the same manner, or would including them on one's CV as an undergraduate student make the CV look like a 'laundry list', in the sense that it starts to appear like a list of insignificant things? \nSecondary question: Does selection for a moderately selective/prestigious winter school count as an 'award' in itself?\nApologies for poor formatting.",

        "text": "I finished my PhD in France a year ago. From my PhD, there are still 2 papers pending. One of them is a conference paper \\[Article A\\] that I intend to turn into a journal article, and the other one has not been published in any form, but I already started writing the article \\[Article B\\]\n\nThe issue is, that in the last year I have not worked hard on finishing the writing of Article B itself. Nevertheless, I made the whole data cleaning, standardization, analysis, Machine Learning models, etc. \n\nToday, I saw that my former supervisor is looking for Master students to basically finish or re-do the papers... Both.\n\nAs far as I remember, I never shared with my supervisors the cleansed, standardized databases, because I sensed that they might do something like this. Therefore, as far as I recall, they would have to re-start all the data analysis, from the raw databases.\n\nOn the other hand, I already have 6 pages of the paper written and re-checked, and I already have the code in python and the results are there.\n\nI admit, I have been lazy finishing the article and perhaps that's why he's doing this, but he just gave me the rage-fueled motivation I needed to finish it in a month or so.\n\nMy question is. What would you do in this case? Try to fix the situation and tell him that he should not hire Master students to do something that I'm already close to finishing? Or just finish the article and send it out by myself, or with a different professor? My supervisors did nothing for this paper. NOTHING, 100% OF THE WORK IS MINE.\n\n**FINALLY, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY. IS THERE A WAY IN WHICH I CAN PUBLISH PARTIAL RESULTS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, TO CLAIM THE OWNERSHIP OF THE ANALYSIS, DATA, ETC? LIKE PUBLISHING IN OPEN ACCESS OR SOMETHING? THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OF MY PHD THESIS IS MINE BY THE WAY.**",

So for me, moving forward with a Ph.D. seems like the natural next step.\n\nHowever, I had the opportunity to do a year of research during my master's, and needless to say, I have never felt more lonely. The number of hours sitting alone at a desk in the office, researching and reading, sucked out my soul and joy.\n\nI am highly extroverted, and I thrive in engaging in debates, discussions, and teaching. I also like working long hours in the lab, engaging with test subjects, and doing analysis. Sitting and reading paper after paper, putting in data manually, and writing each rejected grand proposal again and again, however, was an experience that was soul-destroying, to say the least.\n\nSince then, my interest in a Ph.D. and research has been wavering. I am afraid I will go into 3 years of extreme loneliness. I know that if this is really the case, I will break. However, I am also afraid that if I go outside academia, I will not be able to participate at the forefront of the intellectual debate within my field.\n\nIs this experience of loneliness a normal part of academic research? Or is it based more on specific settings and supervisors?",

However, this is my first time and I have no idea how this will work. Several thing I'd like to hear some suggestions.\n\nShould I ask if she'd like to get lunch before taking her? Or should I just assume so.\n\nShould I greet her before she gives the talk? professors in my department usually do the greeting but since I am taking her to lunch after her talk, I wonder if I should walk up to her and do that with the professors.\n\nShould I offer to show her around the campus or should I just thank her after lunch?\n\nHow should I end it after lunch? Do I walk her back to the building she gave the talk? Walk her back to her car? and etc.\n\nThank you so much everyone!!!",

But I messaged one of her current PhD students to ask if there are openings and he said that the lab is \"fairly at capacity right now\". Given that she started her professorship in 2019, none of her current students will be graduating before fall 23 either. But I also read that most profs don't know if they will have new openings until after the application deadlines, because funding cycles are different from application cycles. \n\nSo do I shoot my shot and add her as a preferred prof in my application?

        "text": "I'm an American graduate student, and I wrote an as-yet-unpublished essay based on a short chapter from the Handbook of the Biology of Aging. My essay reproduces much of the structure, insights, and examples of the original chapter.\n\nHowever, my essay fleshes out the original chapter with new examples, quotes, and insights, and it also completely transforms the language - the only few direct, brief quotes are clearly indicated as quotes. 99.9% of the language is original to me. It also does not include every bit of content from the original. I believe my essay would pass a plagiarism checker (and I intend to confirm that before I ever publish it), and that it makes the content significantly more readable for a new audience.\n\nIf I am clear about how heavily I relied on the original textbook chapter and credit the original author, does this remove any question of plagiarism? Is this an intrinsically plagiaristic way of writing? Or am I overthinking things?\n\nTo illustrate the difference, here is the opening of the original:\n\n&gt;We speak of aging with respect to many nonliving entities as well as living organisms. In doing so we imply that aging is a fundamental process applying generally to living and nonliving entities alike. In general, many things age, eventually deteriorate, and become nonfunctional. Vehicles, household objects, clothes, etc., all last a certain length of time but wear out and reach a point where they no longer fit the purpose for which they were designed.\n\nAnd here is my opening paragraph, expanding on the first two sentences of the original opening paragraph:\n\n&gt;The oldest mountains in the world are The Makhonjwa Mountains in South Africa, which arose 3.6 billion years ago, just before the earliest undisputed evidence of life on Earth. Just as you and I will shrink as we age, so do the mountains: the Makhonjwa range rises to just over a mile above sea level at its maximum. You are probably more familiar with the youngest mountain range in the world, which sprouted 15 million years after the dinosaurs went extinct, in the middle of the Paleogene Period. They are the Himalaya Mountains, and they are not only the youngest but also the tallest mountain range in the world, home to the 5.5 mile high Mt. Everest. How long will it take the Himalayas to crumble into insignificance, and for the Makhonjwa mountains to flatten into a level plain?",

I asked what I  should present, he said, I should focus on my past and current works. Thus, had I not asked, he wouldn't have ever told me that I should focus on my past and current works. I am a bit confused because I expected that he would prefer to know my research ideas more than what I had done in the past. So, can somebody give me an idea of what kind of information the panelists in this kind of presentation (recruitment at a US national lab) would want to hear from their prospective employees?\n\nAnd honestly, my current research is not well connected to the research highlight of this PI. It falls under the same field but lies in the opposite region of the spectrum, so to speak. As an analogy, this guy is doing research in the relativistic velocity, while my research has been on things moving with everyday velocity. I even feel tempted to plan on not talking about my research ideas at all, given that the PI also asked me to focus on my past works. But I don't know if this is a good idea.",

Within days of her birth, the queen bee takes to the skies with several male bees and several worker bees to mate with the male bees. However, scientists believe that the story of male bees dying soon after mating with the queen is actually made up. After mating, the queen bee returns to the hive with the workers she took with her.

He extracts animal DNA from medieval manuscripts, which isn‚Äôt something I would‚Äôve ever guessed could be done for English studies. From my understanding, most of his research pertains to the digital humanities, which is a field I only learned about this semester. I‚Äôm extremely curious to learn more about how it can be used in the context of medieval lit specifically, and I want to ask him (since this is his field of expertise), but I‚Äôm unsure how to go about it. Since my knowledge of both medieval lit &amp; digital humanities is pretty superficial, I don‚Äôt necessarily have specific questions for him; I‚Äôm just curious to learn about more applications of modern/STEM research methods to look at medieval texts. Would I be wasting his time by asking about this stuff out of sheer curiosity? If this weren‚Äôt an incredibly niche area of study, I would definitely try to learn more about it on my own first, but, to be honest, I don‚Äôt know where to begin looking, or what to even look for. \n\nI feel kind of stupid admitting I‚Äôm not sure how to learn more about this on my own; it‚Äôs just so wildly different from applying theory to American lit or Victorian lit (which is pretty much all I did in undergrad).

When I first came into college I was very much so into the Army and wanted to make it a career but have since grown far more interested in my academic endeavors within Psychology and realized I want to pursue a PhD and ultimately conduct research and teach.\n\nI can fulfill my commitment either by going active duty which would delay my entry to grad school by 4-6 years based on when I get a slot to go to job training and when I am able to get out of the service, both of which are hard to predict exactly. Or I  can go into the Reserves. The Reserve route might require me to defer admissions for a year to go to my job training or possibly take a LOA one semester, but would allow for me to hopefully enter immediately following undergrad. The caveat is that for the next 6 years post undergrad I will have training ~1 weekend a month and 2 weeks in the summer.\n\nI think given my career goals and lack of interest in being an army psychologist I'd be most happy going the Reserves route, my only concern is if I'd be setting myself up for failure in my academic endeavors. I've heard so many mixed things on the matter. My Cadre has all told me it is certainly manageable, and I've had two professors agree with them and two disagree. Was hoping to hear specifically from someone who has done it themselves or knows someone who has done it. Or if you just have general comments on the feasibility of such a commitment while in a PhD program. I understand the likelihood I won't finish as fast as some of my peers.",

        "text": "Hi everyone. \n\nI don‚Äôt know whether this is the correct sub for my question but here it is. \n\nI started a PhD back in 2018, switched programs in 2020 (moved closer to my family, it‚Äôs not that I switched programs for no reason) and in early 2022 I was forced out of the program. So I never graduated. If you talk to my ex advisor , he will tell you I was a horrible student who didn‚Äôt deserve to graduate (hence why I had to be kicked out of the program). \n\nIf I look at what happened though - he hired me as a student when he was first starting his lab. He didn‚Äôt have projects to support both my training and the other student in my labs training . I don‚Äôt know why he took me as a student (I think he was an enthusiastic young prof who wanted to grow his lab fast). \n\nWhen I started he asked me to present the projects he had proposed for me to the faculty, which I did but at the time I didn‚Äôt know that he wasn‚Äôt planning on applying for funding or whether the projects were feasible. Knowing what I know now - lack of funding and the logistics surrounding the projects would have made it impossible to finish on time but back then I had no idea and no one else knew either. \n\nAfter this the uni thought I was working on said projects but for a long time I was asked to stay home and wait for funding. If I asked questions about some of the methods, I was given half answers and told that the ‚Äòrest‚Äô of the answers I would get when I started working with the methods myself. I was told that it wasn‚Äôt a priority to train me because my projects lacked funding so he didn‚Äôt want to. If I asked to go shadow my lab mate in the lab - who participated in every single active project our advisor was involved with, I was told no because this would interfere with her training. If I asked for comments on my written work I was told that he couldn‚Äôt because it wasn‚Äôt priority - no active projects for me so no need to provide me with feedback. When finally he received money for a project, he shifted me to that project but this project lacked equipment. After 2 years in the program (it was a 3 yr program), I had barely collected data from 3 participants (out of 47) when he told me to leave because he didn‚Äôt want me in his lab anymore. The collaborators of the project I eventually worked on hired students this summer , and my ex advisor himself hired a new student in September (so 2 semesters after I left) . I genuinely feel like he made a mistake hiring me when he did but as I mentioned previously he kept telling me what a shorty student I was, and how I was horrible to work with. He made me feel worthless, by the comments, by isolating me from my lab mates (since I didn‚Äôt have active projects he had asked me to work at night so that the lab mate I started with could work with the team and ask them questions if needed). \n\nBecause I was told these things again and again, I believed it . Despite passing everything in the program, despite my awards and scholarships that I received while studying. When I left I was heartbroken - my confidence was shattered, I also worked with a psychologist who has been helping me navigate though what happened and why I had nightmares and reacted the way I did while in the program.\n\nThe reason I‚Äôm reaching out to you all now is because I‚Äôve recently been thinking about starting a PhD again. I love the work, I‚Äôm extremely curious and like making sense of my data. I like reading a lot. But I‚Äôm also absolutely afraid to start a PhD - is what I went through normal? I once also cried in front of him because I felt so neglected and asked him to please provide me with feedback (I thought that since he doesn‚Äôt provide me with feedback he is not happy with the work I produce), he told me to mind my own business and that I should do as he says and not complain basically. Again - is all this normal? Is this the general way PI treat their students?",
