Steps to reproduce\n\nNavigate to any post that contains an URL containing an underscore, e.g. [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/physicsmemes\/comments\/10zs1e7\/comment\/j84zfpe](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/physicsmemes\/comments\/10zs1e7\/comment\/j84zfpe) or various self-promotion posts on r\/webtoons. Open it on\n\n1. A mobile device in a browser,\n2. Via old.reddit.com,\n3. In Chrome on Desktop using the developer tools to emulate a mobile device.\n\n# 2. Observed behavior\n\n1. On desktop and in the official Android app the link says `https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jerk_%28physics%29` just as expected.\n2. On the mobile website the link renders as `https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jerk\\_%28physics%29`. This link is incorrect due to the added backslash before the underscore. The behavior can be reproduced on Google Chrome (Windows) with the developer tools, when emulating a mobile device. Might require reloading for Reddit to switch to the mobile layout. It seems dependent on user configuration however: In Incognito mode, the link rendered correctly on the mobile website and they layout looked differently then what I am used to.\n3. The same error is visible on old.reddit.com ([https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/physicsmemes\/comments\/10zs1e7\/dont\\_be\\_a\/j84zfpe](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/physicsmemes\/comments\/10zs1e7\/dont_be_a\/j84zfpe)).\n\n# 3. Expected behavior\n\nThe link should render as  `https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jerk_%28physics%29`  across all platforms.\n\n# 4. Additional information\n\nOn the r\/webtoons posts, in some cases I posted a fixed link. So apparently when posting the URL with an underscore from an affected reddit client, the issue does not exist.\n\nOther threads mentioning this bug hint at the issue occurring when posts created with the \"Fancy Pants Editor\" are viewed on the affected clients, which would be consistent with my experience of being able to post a \"corrected\" link from the mobile-web version of Reddit, where I use a plain-text editor with markdown.\n\nI was able to confirm this below by posting the same link by pasting it into the markdown editor and into the fancy-pants editor.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/pgybnrljksha1.png?width=593&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4a7667fc7bc60973e1051714338bce444606a9d3\n\nAs seen, when posted in the fancy-pants editor and then viewing as a mobile web-page, the link is broken; When posting it as markdown text, the link looks correct.\n\n# 5.

The older Post Flair will not be found either in the JSON list or the Sidebar Widget of Flairs, but will still be present on old Posts, making the old Post Flair unsearchable without entering it into the URL manually, or by finding a post that still has the old Flair name and clicking it to search by it.\n\n**How to reproduce the problem**\n\n* Make a Post Flair, e.g. 'Test1'\n* Post something i.e. 'Post1' and flair it under 'TestFlair1'\n* Go back to Post Flair editing, and rename the 'TestFlair1' Flair to 'TestFlair2'\n   * i.e. Don't delete and create a new one, just rename the Post Flair\n* Post a second post i.e. 'Post2' and flair it under the renamed Post Flair (now called 'TestFlair2')\n* Search by Post Flair. This can be done in 2 ways;\n   * Click on either Post Flair as it appears on the Post\n      * 'Post1' will appear but 'Post2' will not, and vice versa.\n   * Or click on the Post Flair as it appears on the Sidebar Widget in the Reddit Redesign.\n      * 'Post2' with 'TestFlair2' will only be visible (as the Sidebar Widget updates the Post Flairs when they are renamed)\n      * 'TestFlair1' will not appear on the Post Flair Sidebar Widget despite still existing.\n* As a Mod, click the Flair button of 'Post1' to show the re-Flairing options.\n   * 'Post1' will list as 'TestFlair2' even though the Post Flair says 'TestFlair1' everywhere else.\n   * It can only be renamed as 'TestFlair2' everywhere else by clicking another option and then re-flairing it as 'TestFlair2'.\n\n**Possible Explanation**\n\nI think it's because the URL searches only by the string shown on the Post Flair, as it currently is, instead of the Flair ID. This ignores previous namings of the flair if it was renamed.\n\nI originally found this out when I renamed a Post Flair from 'DiMAGE - Digital' to 'DiMAGE - Digital *Photography*' on r\/minolta for ease of understanding. When I clicked on a new post with the renamed Flair, only a single new entry showed up and didn't show the older ones. This goes as deep as the [Flair JSON](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/minolta\/api\/link_flair.json). Even though older posts still showed 'DiMAGE - Digital' on Reddit, the JSON didn't list it at all because both DiMAGE flair variations were used by the same Post Flair ID.\n\nThe repercussion is that if you rename a Post Flair later on, you lose almost all search abilities on older forms of that Flair **UNLESS** you re-flair all of the old posts... a big task on small subs, impossible if it's a heavily used flair on a very large subreddit. The only way to find it is to edit the URL to the old flair name, which requires knowledge and memory of it existing in the first place.\n\n**Possible Solution**\n\nInstead of having the URL search for Post Flairs by the text string;\n\n    https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/minolta\/?f=flair_name%3A%22DiMAGE%20-%20Digital%20Photography%22\n\nhave the URL search by Post Flair ID;\n\n    https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/minolta\/?ID=\"2445eee8-bfd4-11ec-8107-4253e6cb99be\"\n\n(Or however it can be done if not via URL - I'm not adept at coding). That should cover all historical versions of a particular flair because the ID of a Post Flair doesn't change unless you delete it. This is already evidentially feasible if the re-flair list of a Mod lists an old Flair name under the new name.","upvote_ratio":0.72,"created_utc":1672842530.0},{"title":"Can\u2019t Disable Spatial Audio","author":"MuriloA","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/bugs\/comments\/103c9ki\/cant_disable_spatial_audio\/","text":"A couple days ago I noticed that all videos on the Reddit app plays with spatial audio.
