        "text": "This is the tale of how my party of 4 level 17 adventurers nearly died to a single cleric and a swarm of ghost like bugs. But to start from the begining, the party is made up of four people and this is going to get confusing so here they are:\n\n***\n * Luna: Human Eldritch knight, vengeance paladin.\n * Wakkum: Dwarf Fighter\n * Harford: Half-orc Arcane trickster\n * Lady Nightengale: half-elf Druid\n\n***\n\nThe party had been tormented in their dreams by a coven of hags, who the rogue had managed to piss off, and the coven had begun creating monsters to send at the party. They Made their way to the Hag lair, finding a passage to an underground cavern.\n\nFIghting their way through the party finally made it to the last room before the coven, Guarded by a Plague Cleric, a level 11 spellcaster with the contagion spell and a single swarm of insects that acted the same as a ghost, being as that they can fill the body and on a failed save incapacitate the target and possess the body until the body is knocked to 0. \n\nEveryone rolls initiative, fight begins. The party starts off with a pretty good intiative rolls and acts before the cleric, Wakkum and Nightengale(Now in the form of a fire elemental) charge the cleric down dealing large sums of damage, but not killing it. In return the cleric casts Contagion on the Druid, giving her disadvantage on intelligence checks, saves and *CONFUSION* in combat!\n\nThis is when shit starts to go awry, the insects manage to possess Harford taking control of his body. The rest of the party ignores this threat to deal with the cleric, however this is when Luna decides to take matters into her own hands and charges the cleric attempting to misty step in range. \n\nNow the rest of the party had been conservative with spell use due to the fact the magical mist that fills the room causes the weave of magic to react similar to wild magic. When one wishes to cast a spell, they must make an arcana check or the spell could go arwy and a random magical effect could  happen simultaneously.\n\nLuna makes her arcana check\n\n**Natural ONE**\n\nThe spell fails, and wild magic takes hold. The result? Switch minds with a random enemy within range, the only one visible? The cleric! Suddenly staring out at her body and her comrades she decides that killing the body of the cleric is the best bet she has and begins stabbing herself.\n\nWakkum now very confused, less so than the remaining members of his party has a brief talk with luna now in the body of the cleric claiming that they switched bodies, and decides to take out her body as she is taking out the clerics.\n\nHilarity insues, the Fire elemental druid cant roll above a 6 and keeps doing nothing, failing her saves vs contagion. The Insect possessed Harford fires crossbow rounds at Wakkum. Luna in the clerics body firebolts herself learning she can still cast spells in this new body. Wakkum and the cleric in lunas body begin fighting it out. \n\nThis is when the cleric in the body of luna realises he too has access to his magic and attempts to blight wakkum and end the fight early, that when he makes his arcana check.\n\n**NATURAL ONE**\n\nThe effect? The spell reverts and affects the caster instead. While the wild magic effect? Switch bodies with a random enemy! Gm rolls... switches bodies back with Luna! so just as she returns to her own body she sees the blight returning on her and is blighted unconscious and bleeding out.\n\nWakkum turns his attention to insect harford. The two of them fight it out, just when harford is knocked to 0 as a half-orc he stays up as wakkum now out of attacks and out of range. Insect harford stabs himself and the swarm charges toward wakkum looking to possess another fool, however does not recieve its ability back. \n\nLuna bleeding out is barely making death saves, and nightengale hasnt moved and is just out of range to hit the bleeding out luna to the south, while wakkum manages to barely kill the swarm he rushes over and stabalizes luna, unable to make it to harford. Still in combat cause they are making saves, the confusion diseased druid finally rolls somthing different... a one. Creature rolls a d8 and moves in a random direction, rolls a d8 and gets.. move south...DIRECTLY OVER luna! suddenly the on fire fighter is making death saves again, and wakkum has to ignore hardford to rush back and stabalise her, using his decanter of endless water to douse the flames, while harford nears 3 fails on his death saves, wakkum manages to just barely save the rogue, ending combat and the druids confusion.\n\nOnly the druid was mechanically confused, but all the players were mentally confused.

        "text": "The glowing holographic screen is the only light in my cabin aside from the dimly glowing lights of the cramped dock my ship is currently parked in, illuminating everything in a soft, orange glow. My ship. The sudden realization sets in and my heart races. This is it. What I’ve always dreamed of has finally come true. Now I can finally begin taking jobs and enjoy the freedom of space. I’m finally going to become a freelancer. I scroll through the hundreds of jobs posted to the bulletin board on my holoscreen. They all seem so far out of my league. I cross reference the map several times, most of the courier jobs are to systems much farther than I can afford to go. Fuel is not cheap at all. Ah ha! I found one! Some CEO wants a physical copy of a contract delivered to someone just a couple systems over. I can do this one! It doesn’t pay much, but everyone starts somewhere, right? I quickly accept the job and wait for the package to be delivered to my ship.\n\nOnce loaded, I nervously go through the preflight checklist. Flipping various switches, turning knobs, and controls. All systems are responsive. My HUD tells me my ship is ready for flight. I take a deep steadying breath. I reach forward with a shaking hand and tap the command to take me outside dock and into the landing bay. The conveyor belt moves the platform my ship is on forward a few meters as the blast doors above me slowly slide open. I gaze up through the door as the platform is raised through it. I’ve never seen the inside of a landing bay before. The huge cylinder is lined with hundreds of docks, and just as many ships of all kinds of makes and models passing through. I tap the button on the side of my helmet, turning on my radio pre-tuned to Space Traffic Control. “This is Commander Altenstud of The Bastion requesting permission to depart for Bay 24.”\n\nI take another deep breath as I await the response. “Commander Altenstud, you are clear for departure. You have 10 minutes to clear the port. Happy flying.” The cool voice says from the other side. A countdown timer appears on the bottom of my display as I try to look competent with my first real flight. The simulations are state of the art, and almost true to life, but you always know they are simulations. This is real. With real consequences. I lift off of the dock and head toward the exit, careful to match the rotation of the station to fit through the door. I know the opening is huge, but it still feels too small. I carefully adjust my angle, trying to avoid the other ships and make it through the bay in one piece. Sudden claustrophobia sinks in. I approach the door and punch the accelerator just to get out of there, feeling like I’m finally able to breathe once I make it into the great vastness of space.\n\nI grew up in that station my whole life. I’ve looked into the darkness of space every day, but this is the first moment that I’ve felt truly free. I detract my landing gear and put some space between me and the station, before settling into a comfortable drift while I plot a course in my navigational computer. A target appears on my window showing me where the system is. I angle the ship toward it and push the accelerator to max, and flip the switch to charge my Frame Shift Drive. My ship announces the FSD is charged, and a bright light fills my view as a hole into hyperspace is torn and I’m sucked into it. I can’t pretend to know how it works, but I can tell you it’s beautiful. Sort of like the time travel in that old show that comes on late at night.\n\nI drop out of hyperspace and I consult my navigation charts again. My heart sinks as I realize I’ve immediately bungled my first mission. I jumped to the wrong system! I quickly plot a new course and jump back to where I started, and another to the next system in the right direction. I’m already at 50% fuel. I decide it would be best to refuel here before making another jump. Just to be safe. As I supercruise through the system toward a station, my screen starts flashing and my ship begins lurching out of control. INTERDICTION DETECTED flashes over and over, filling my screen. My heart races, pounding in my chest. This was not covered at all in training. I pull desperately at the controls to keep the ship steady and in supercruise, but the heaving ship is too much. I drop violently out of supercruise and immediately a gruff, angry voice fills my ears. “Hand over the contract!” he bellows as lasers fly past my ship from his.\n\nI throw the throttle as far forward as I can to try and build some distance between us. Combat was always the hardest part for me in training, especially with the basic lasers that I’ve got on The Bastion. I frantically try to spin the Frame Shift Drive back up to escape the pirate I know I cannot beat, but it hasn’t yet cooled down. I scream in frustration at my basic equipment, and only pray I live long enough to have a decent ship. I may not know how to fight, but I know how to fly. I take tight turns and hard banks, doing whatever I can to make sure he doesn’t get a good line of sight on me. My shields take a beating, but I think they’ll hold. Finally, the FSD begins charging again. I bank hard, making my ship groan and face the pirate. I fire wildly. A few lasers make a glancing blow against his shield, but not nearly enough to do any real damage, but just enough to make him turn away from me. I slam my hand down on the large red button and watch another hole tear open before me, and I speed away from the pirate.\n\nI sit back in my seat and breathe a sigh of relief. I made it. I drop out of hyperspace not far from the station the contract needs to be delivered to. “You thought you could escape that easily, did you?” a familiar voice taunts through my headset as the pirates ship comes into view. As his weapon hardpoints open up and his lasers ready I push the throttle and fly past him as fast as I can accelerate making a beeline to the station. I wonder if this guy is as dumb as I hope he is. Lasers fly at me, but I stay the course. I reroute all shields to the rear and take minimal evasive action. The station is the key to my survival in this fight.\n\nI watch the distance tracker count down as I get closer and closer to the station, I glance at my shield readout as they get lower. I’m not sure I’m going to make this one. Finally, I hear the glorious voice. “You have entered a No Fire Zone! Detract hardpoints now, or we will fire on you!” I detract my hardpoints, but I do not slow down. I can pay a speeding fine, but only if I live. The pirate doesn’t falter. He must know that my shields are almost completely gone. Huge turbo lasers fly through space from all over the station fly past me and begin slamming into the pirate. He breaks off and I finally breathe easier. The authorities will handle this one. “Commander Altenstud, please come to a stop and prepared to be scanned.”\n\nI turn my ship to watch the pirate try to avoid the lasers, but he’s gone far too close to the station. I go ahead and request landing as the scan completes. The pirate’s ship explodes in a magnificent and one sided fight and the Air Traffic Controller comes back into my headset. “Commander Altenstud, you’re clear. Please proceed to landing platform 09.” I clumsily find my way into the station and onto the landing pad. I quickly send the platform into the dock and send the contract away. I receive a message confirming transfer of funds to my account and I collapse onto my console, relishing in a job well done. I pull my headset off and rub my eyes and temples, and make arrangements for room and board for the night. I’m going to need to rest up if I’m going to be taking more jobs. Space is dangerous, and I need a lot of expensive upgrades...",

        "text": "Every weekend, our group of friends plays one of a few different game - but for about a year and a half now we've been playing Pathfinder, with some CoC and some Deadlands: Reloaded peppered in. This story takes place in the earlier days, when we had an open door policy for anyone who wanted to play.\nThe core party consists of: \n - **Veruca Thicket**: Elf Ranger, spent a substantial amount of time convincing the rest of us not to kill any of the DMs NPC creatures (even hostile ones),  \n - **Cornish Soggybottom**: a Halfling Rogue, who was undetectable more often than not, as well as the resident skill monkey.  \n - **Lash K'lishkahn**: Half-Orc Barbarian, who spent most of her time splitting skulls and setting fires.   \n - **Odjah'b**: a Dwarven Cleric, who's job was to make sure the the rogue and the barbarian didn't get arrested or burn down the town\n and   \n - **Tamlin Greenshrub**: a Halfling Bard,who was the face and voice of the party, as well as the quintessential lover of booze and wenches. \n\n \n   Over the duration of the campaign, we have had our fair share of one off players, and a few that kept at it until they were forced away by real life. Then there is JT (All Player names have been changed to protect the innocent), who actively played with us for a few months. Good RPer, had a decent amount of understanding for the game. Unfortunately, JT had a nasty habit of holding a grudge, and flying off the handle. He was playing a Human Druid, and was appropriately respectful of life in general.\n   The DM sets the story; our rambunctious heroes find themselves having fallen through a mad wizard's portal, and awake to find a litany of over-sized trees and flora, outlined by an imposing mountain range. After a few survival checks and a bit of scouting, our party realizes that they have been spirited away to a prehistoric era.\n *Cue Dinosaurs*   \nRunning from a T-Rex, the party dodges into a crevasse they spot, and temporarily find reprieve from their pursuers. \n   The discussion at the table briefly turns to the topic of the dog, Leila, sleeping under the table. Someone, I forget exactly who, called the dog \"Her\", and JT, the defender of all that is PC and right, jumps to his feet the give us all a lecture on how \"we shouldn't assign gender roles to dogs because they have no understanding of such or ability to identify\" and went on a tirade. Like Denis Leary yelling about Maple Nut Coffee from 7-11. Only, not as funny. \n   After he had said his piece, the person who was playing the Elf Ranger, calmly tells JT to \"Shut the fuck up, that's retarded. Let's keep playing, and not worry about the dog's personification.\" All in all, quite appropriate. But not to JT's liking.\n   JT gets so butt-hurt by the comment, and that apparently no one at the table cared one way or the other about the topic, he decides to split from the party (in game) and trek on ahead, but keep the knowledge to himself. About an hour goes by (we just allowed him to continue as did the DM - probably a mistake) and the party has made it back within line of sight of JT. At this point, JT starts spouting off, and Veruca cannot stand to listen to it anymore. She strides up to the Druid, and says OOC  \n *'I Roll to bitchslap this fool.'* \n\nJT's mouth hits the flood. Veruca rolls: \n\n**Nat 20**\n\nThe table erupts in laughter, and the DM rules (through tears of laughter) that the conversation is dead, and threatens \"Rocks Fall\" if it is brought up again.\nThe butt-hurt Druid grabs his sheet, his dice and makes his way for the door, wiping his eyes and generally being a shitty player. \nAnd so, the Crit-Slap was born and forged into legend around our table. \n\n\nEDIT: Formatting and such\n\nEDIT 2: Spelling\n\n",

        "text": "First off, a little context about the game. Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead (or c:dda for short) is a roguelike set in a zombie apocalypse... Sort of. There's really a bunch more to it than that, as well as a surprisingly deep lore, most of which can be discovered ingame. To avoid spoiling anything to anyone who'd want to discover it for themselves, I'll just say this: there's a lot more than just zombies out there. This story is about that.\n\nI had started a new character, and was doing fairly well for myself. I'd started in a shopping mall (For that extra challenge) and had gotten away with some alright gear. In the parking lot, I even found a functional Pickup truck, and I'd siphoned enough gas from nearby cars to get it enough fuel to last me a little while.\n\nI'd just finished scouting the nearest town (which has still been a 15 minute-drive away from the mall) and was feeling pretty well off. It was then I decided to explore further south in my pickup truck, affectionately nicknamed the Pickup Line. My mistake was heading down a little side road to see what was at the end.\n\nI couldn't have known what was about to happen. It was a beautiful day, zombie-less as I was driving around the countryside and far from any city. Every now and then, a straggling hostile animal would come after me, but the Pickup Line outpaced them all.\n\nThe first sign of the impending doom were the Giant Ants. Ants that have mutated to be massive, think about waist high. That's the normal ones. The Soldier Ants are twice that. That was good news for me. Ants are a surprisingly good source of meat (I guess if those African countries can do it for the small ones...) and pretty much renewable. They've got a mean bite to them and are aggressive if you get too close, but apart from that, they usually don't bother you too much.\n\nI was happy by this discovery. I knew my food problems would be sorted throughout Winter, when it came to that, so I marked it on my map and moved on.\n\nThe real problems started appearing along with the fungaloid.\n\nNow fungaloids are anything but fun. They're mushroom beings and are notorious for having an absurd reproduction capacity. Randomly while they're alive, or every time one of them dies, they release spores. spores can hit the ground and take root or disintegrate. Every spore that plants successfully becomes with time a new fungaloid. Oh, and they're hostile to ants.\n\nSo now, there was an army of ants marching against an army of fungaloids, and me driving down the middle of the road. Both were hostile to me now, and to each other. Whenever they weren't busy killing each other, they were trying to kill me. And more kept arriving attracted by the noise of the battle and of my gradually speeding up pickup truck.\n\nAt this point, driving meant I had to ram the fuckers since they were too dense on the road to avoid hitting them anymore. My truck didn't like that, and though it was a solid old thing, it was taking hits as it dished them out. But I didn't turn around.My thought process was that I couldn't afford to stop now, I'd be surrounded and the truck wrecked as they pummeled through it. My only choice was to make it further along the road, hope they thinned out, and turn around, or hope for a safe place and hole up there for a while. So I kept driving, ever faster, and ramming into them.\n\nThen all hell broke loose when the triffids showed up.\n\nTriffids are dangerous. *Way* dangerous. They are animate plants, similar to They all have paralytic venom, and the regular cannon fodder are as tall as moose. They hit like trucks and have boatloads of health. I definitely can't handle those things, even with the truck.\n\nOh, and did I mention they're hostile to both other groups I'd met before?\n\nIn 5 minutes, my quaint sunny Sunday drive has taken me from the rolling meadows and happy forest to a fucking war zone, where a fight rages between giant ants, ferocious and in endless numbers, mushroom beings, steady and in exponentially endless numbers, and giant Murder-Ents, really really scary and also in endless numbers. Oh, and that one stupid human sod driving through the heart of it all in his increasingly battered pickup truck.\n\nAt this point I can't even begin to avoid them. I plow through them all, ants, fungaloids, and triffids alike. They all declare truces to go after me, and I know the Pickup Line can't take much more of this. The engine is already making strange noises, I've lost both headlights, the windshield is non-existent now, I've lost some speed. Unless I get out of there really quick, the Pickup Line will wheeze its last and I'll be stranded in death land. And then, I arrive at the end of the road. Empty, except for a military bunker, and a river behind it.\n\nI'm saved! A bunker, now *there's* what I need! It's solid, built to endure it all, and is probably *filled* with military-grade toys I can use to get away after resting for a bit. Angelic choirs of salvation start playing in my head. But then, I suddenly remember, with soul-crushing desperation, that none of it matters to me because *the goddamn door is locked*.\n\nI've got a river in front of me, which might as well be a wall because I can't cross it without drowning or losing all my gear. I've got a locked bunker to my right, along with a bunch of fungaloids, I've got triffids on my left, and behind me, I have my only escape route. Oh, and the heart of the massacre. My truck is already running on fumes, and I've got nasties of every denomination closing in on me.\n\nSo, with great resignation, I turn around and head back right in. Out of the fire, back in the fire again. I won't bore you with the details, as the way back is much like the way in. Except, of course, my truck dies right in the middle. I can't even spare a second to grieve for the brave fallen truck. Monsters are already closing in on me now that speed is no longer my all, so I grab my things and head into the deathzone on foot.\n\nI take hits from all sides. I mostly manage to avoid the triffids, which could likely kill me *real* quick, but I'm not doing well. My pants take one too many hits and rip completely, I am being followed and surrounded by every freak of nature I've mentioned so far, and I'm running like a madman, probably crying of fear the whole way, while the Battle of the Titans rages all around me, in the cold, and in my skivvies.\n\nI almost made it. I was at the end of the road. I even drank an energy cola I had in my pack to try to give myself a boost. But my stamina gave out, and I got surrounded and killed. \n\nI sure wonder what my corpse will look like to anyone who finds it, a grown man, with no pants, an expression of horror frozen on his face, clutching an energy drink can in his cold dead hands. What a way to go.",

        "text": "Hello again Reddit. Welcome back to the adventures of Twitch, Kit-Kat, Sargan and Kitten. This story takes place some weeks after the last that I posted, https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3ya0f5/shadowrun_how_to_screw_yourself_completely_with/, and begins as most runs do: The team was running desperately low on money. The nuyen reserves had once again dwindled to a pathetic stash beneath the mattress as the team worked on their own projects.\n\nKitten had finally put together the spear mentioned in https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3xwmqc/shadowrun_how_to_bake_a_fingerpie_or_why/ while Twitch had managed to acquaint herself with a premium grade bioware surgeon. Kit-Kat made a few modifications to her treasured van and Sargan, ever the fiscally responsible one, tinkered with his rifle. It was, of course, Sargan who determined that we would soon be unable to afford our shared lifestyle for much longer. Like a vampire patiently biding it's time to strike, our home was quickly bleeding us dry of our hard-earned monetary lifeblood. Thus, sadly, it was time once more to put on our expendable asset hats and get to work.\n\nIt took a surprisingly long amount of time before we picked up a job. None of the fixers that we had worked with were able to provide us tasks that suited our team; everything either required a nova-hot hacker or a magician with a greater intellect than your average lemming. As these were both requirements that our particular group was lacking, days passed by without a single nuyen to be gained. Desperation began to kick in and, like a rabid drop-bear hungry for flesh, we snapped up the first thing that came along. One of our contacts tentatively offered up a task for hire, claiming that no-one else was willing to even meet with the Johnson let alone complete the task.\n\nHa! What fools, say we! I think I feel a change in the wind, says Sargan! I hope we get to kill something, says Twitch! Stay away from my chainsaw, says Kit-Kat! Kitten...actually, Kitten was passed out in his make-shift hammock as he was want to do. Thankfully, the shaman had very little input when it came to group decisions. He didn't even really get paid, asking Sargan for something whenever he needed it. His low maintenance nature was possibly the only thing truly positive about him.\n\nSargan and Twitch were to meet with the contact in Sydney Park. When pressed for a description, the fixer told them that they would know him when they saw him. Alright, bizarre but the group has already dealt with worse so we all buckled up in the van and trundled off to the meet.\n\nOur Johnson had requested that we rendezvous at mid-day, during the lunch break for most corporate wage-slaves. Arriving there half an hour before-hand, a good tactic for any professional criminal, the team assumed their positions: Sargan waiting patiently on a park bench feeding ducks, Twitch jogging in criminally short training pants while Kit-Kat assumed over-watch from the van. Kitten, as you might expect, was snoring away contently back at base. It was probably best for everyone involved, come to think of it.\n\nThe team waited patiently for our client to appear, whiling away the seconds in various ways. Just when it looked like Twitch was going to have an aneurysm from sheer boredom, he arrived. Kit-Kat had to double check what she was seeing before hesitantly telling Sargan that she might have found our man. The hawk-eyed sniper lazily peered around before stopping, his casual demeanor shattered. Our Johnson, a portly human man with a perpetually dopey expression, was dressed like a 1960's spy. A long trench coat tried to conceal his considerable girth while a literal fedora and glasses did nothing to hide his identity. Coupled with the increasingly nervous demeanor, Sargan was almost positive that this was our man. What he couldn't figure out was...why!?\n\nTwitch jogged past, offering a tantalizing view of skin, and curtly directed him to join Sargan. Shuffling over to the seated elf, Mr Johnson made sure to check for followers every three steps. He was only half way across the path when Sargan loudly asked for 'Johnie, my old son' to sit down, shut up and feed the goddamn birds. Unsurprisingly, he did just that. There were a few, precious moments of silence before the hapless Mr Johnson leaned over and spoke. \n\n\"The swallow flies east in the winter.\" It was said with the tone of someone who thought they were being terribly clever. Sargan, not knowing what the hell he was talking about, responded appropriately.\n\n\"Mate, I've got no bloody idea what the hell you're talking about. Stop being a tit and tell me what the job is.\" Surprised and confused, the Johnson proceeded to do just that...after introducing himself as Stanley Jensen, senior manager for a local corporation. \n\n\"Don't fucking give your real name, you tosser. We call you Mr Johnson because you're identity is meant to be a secret.\" Stanley was surprised by this, having believed that the polite man he had contacted simply got his name wrong. Kit-Kat had to go communication silent as she was laughing like so many hyena's in a sack and Twitch collapsed into a small bush from her hysteria. Sargan, the consummate professional, maintained his composure and asked for the details of our task.\n\nThe target was Stanley's wife, Madeline Jensen. She was a corporate executive from a rival company and had been forbidden from seeing her husband due to the corporate politics involved. Stanley wanted us to break into the arcology that she was being held in and snatch her out from under CorpSec's noses. Sargan was just about to begin haggling for our pay when he stopped.\n\n\"Arcology? I thought only the Triple-A corps had those...\" The proverbial light-bulb sprang into life above Sargan's head at the same time that our beloved murder-bunnies stopped laughing. Stanley nodded and confirmed that his wife worked for Saeder-Krupp. It was at this moment that Sargan came to a decision: Hell no. Most runner teams, regardless of how long they've been operating, know better than to screw with the German based corporation. You don't try to mess with a literal dragon and escape unharmed. With nothing more to talk about, Sargon casually rocked onto his feet and started to walk away. It was at this time that Stanley unearthed that most powerful of Shadowrunner faults: Greed.\n\n\"I can pay you two hundred thousand nuyen.\" This was a large amount of money, Sargan noted with some indecision. It might even be enough to warrant disrupting Lowfyr's operations but the elf was a creature of logic through and through. Even with Kit-Kat chanting to take it in the background, Sargan knew what their answer was. Or what it would have been had Twitch not hurtled over the park-bench and shake Stanley's hand.\n\n\"We'll take it! Thanks for the nuyen, Stan!\" The contract accepted, Stanley offered up what little information he could to the petrified Sargan. Twitch, her part done, sprinted down the running path with a whoop of glee and a cart-wheel thrown in for good measure. Eventually, our social manipulator returned to his chariot only to find his erstwhile team-mates exchanging congratulations. There was little to be done about it now, he reasoned, save to salvage whatever he could from the situation. \n\nSome research was called for, once they returned to the estate and informed Kitten about their new task. Not really understanding the concept of two hundred thousand anything, the shaman yawned and went along with it. He didn't know if he could take a dragon in a fight but was prepared to give it his best shot. Once it was explained to him that Lowfyr wouldn't actually be there, Kitten was far happier to go along with whatever plan they came up with. \n\nIt took a few well-placed, and painfully expensive, bribes to obtain the information our intrepid runners needed. Mrs Jensen was a medium level executive for Saeder-Krupp, operating as the human resources manager for SK's local branch. Madeline was housed in the arcology, a heavily fortified facility the size of a large shopping center and staffed by a private military, so it wasn't going to be an easy task to liberate her from it. With some incredible luck, we managed to find some old floor plans for the outpost. It gave us something to work with, even if it was missing a few very important things: Positions of drones, guards or spirits that would undoubtedly be providing security for such an important installation. \n\nA plan slowly emerged from our caffeine and sugar fueled brain-storming: Kitten would perform some astral reconnaissance on the property while Kit-Kat inspected the perimeter defenses. Twitch and Sargan would work on an appropriate cover-story, one that would allow him to enter without too much suspicion. They ended up choosing a freelance reporter, a small-time social justice blogger up in arms about some issue or another. They spent a week, and the very last of our nuyen on a talented hacker, making it air-tight enough to pass through SK cyber-security. Meanwhile, Kitten had identified not one but two spirits dedicated to weeding out any infiltrators. \n\nWith this information in place, we were left with few options. Kit-Kat was rendered helpless against the spirits since they could just locate her life energy, negating her exceptional stealth capabilities. Twitch couldn't really operate as a normal human being for long enough to pass through the security checkpoints, so she was out. That left Sargan, who was already heading inside, and Kitten. Our over-all plan was to knock her out with tranq-patchs, making it seem like a kidnapping instead of a liberation, and then cart her out through a back entrance. We would repaint Kit-Kat's van as that of a courier service, along with suitable identification, and have her wait near the walls. Twitch would be waiting to deal with any guards who were too canny for their own good. \n\nKitten would infiltrate alongside Sargan, invisible to any physical surveillance. The question became, how would he hide from the spirits? As luck would have it, Kitten had recently become initiated into the deeper mysteries of magic and had developed the ability to actively shield himself from the prying gaze of other mystic beings. Theoretically, this would grant him the ability to move unseen throughout the arcology. The team would have preferred a little more conviction from their resident shaman but they would work with what they had.\n\nThe day arrived. Sargan, false identity in place, emerged from his hired taxi and nervously presented himself to the visitor's security checkpoint. After a thorough inspection of his person, including a slightly longer than appropriate pat-down, the elf was allowed restricted access into the inner workings of the establishment. He was given detailed directions to Miss Jensen's office and strict instructions not to deviate from the path. Sargan thanked the guard and began his long, anxiety-riddled route to the target. The sniper would simply have to hope that Kitten was fulfilling his role. \n\nIt took him a few minutes to arrive at his location, strolling down the identical hallways with a purpose. Before long, Sargan found himself standing before the door of one Madeline Jensen. He steeled himself for what was to come and knocked on the door. Once, twice and then thrice his fist rapped across the frosted glass panel before a woman's voice called for him to enter. Holding the door open for slightly longer than would be considered normal, Sargan noted a few minor issues. First off, it appeared that the guard earlier had not spoken out of turn. It was in fact *Miss* Jensen who stood before him currently and, while she was indeed an ork, she was the largest ork that Sargan had ever seen in his goddamn life. Possessed of more muscle than a bodybuilding contest, Sargan was beginning to worry that they didn't have enough drugs to take her out. \n\nThankfully, Kitten shared no such concerns. Having been floating along invisibly ever since the taxi, the young shaman had been more concerned with rendering himself undetectable by the spirits around them. Now, as the human resources manager stared introduced herself warmly to her interviewer, he had only one mission. The team had told him not to diverge from his task from the beginning and so, latched onto the ork woman. \n\nSurprised by a sudden weight around her, Madeline had little time to react. Kitten slapped one of the direct injection patches on her neck and held on for dear life as she started swinging him around. Sargan leaped onto the flailing woman and tried to subdue her. Unfortunately for the two of them, Madeline was at least as strong as both runners combined. The drugs were slowly working their way through her system but it wasn't quite enough to drop her. It was all the duo could do to stop her from hitting an alarm or calling her help, slowly being dragged across the room in her desperate bid for freedom.\n\nThankfully, Kitten had prepared for this. When the team had given him a patch from their armory, the magician had a rare burst of inspiration. He quietly pocketed a pair of the tranquilizers and went about his business. You can see what's coming, right? If you guessed Kitten slapping the target with both patches then congratulations, you're correct. Now with enough drugs in her system to take out a rampaging bear, the ork succumbed to the tender embrace of unconsciousness. Sargan, panicking internally about a possible over-dose, ordered Kitten to levitate her out the window and down to the conveniently located truck. Kitten, somewhat disappointed that his clever thinking hadn't been praised, complied sulkily. The window opened and absolutely nothing dropped silently by the van. Twitch and Kit-Kat loaded her in, before driving away at a leisurely pace. \n\nSargan left quickly, barely escaping the alarm that was raised after security discovered the missing manager. She was delivered to the agreed upon location, sent by text communication in the smart thing that Stanley had done, and the team returned home to enjoy their money. Then the last call came through. Stanley nervously asked when we would be dropping his wife off. He seemed baffled when we told him that we had just left her at the rendezvous site. His response?\n\n\"The what? I'm sorry, you're breaking up. I can't hear or see you.\" The video call displayed a shadow detaching from the wall behind Stanley, blade in hand, before it cut off. There was single rifle shot from behind us, advertising Madeline's final fate. As we drove home in stunned silence, we received a single message. \n\n'Well done. Payment inbound.' \n\nWhoever had sent us that message, the person who had organized this whole thing and made it seem like Stanley's idea, paid us. In the end, I suppose that's all we really cared about but laying low seemed like a good idea for a while.\n\nThe moral of the story, chummer? You should always double check your information.",

        "text": "Sol Santo was the 28th state admitted to the Union, having been ceded to the American government, from Spain, in 1822. It is a large island in the Gulf of Mexico, twenty miles from the upper Texas coast; a single four-lane interstate connects Sol Santo to the mainland. The island is rather small, covering less area than Rhode Island, and four cities compose the entire state: Diamond, state capital and upscale refuge; Harvos, a cluttered wasteland of parking lots, shopping malls, suburbs, and fast-food dining; Shell Beach, home to surfers, tourist, and the workers than fuel the island's “Endless Summer”; and, finally, Sol Santo, named identically to the state, a dense metropolis of skyscrapers and condominiums. The powerful Suncorp group own most of Sol Santo, and want to own even more. The island has the highest crime and murder rate in America, almost double that of Chicago, while possessing only 1 million residents. This story is about four of those residents.\n\nLarry is an office drone during the day, but after hours (and sometimes during hours) he rips off databases as one of most talented hackers in Sol Santo. A crippling fear of females has prevented him from attending college, advancing at work, or doing anything generally useful with his life. He spends much of the day with one eye on the Suncorp Home Shopping Network buying an endless supply of swords, knives, and throwing stars. He is obsessed, and, consequently, broke as a result of this HSN addiction. However, life in the “house” has been good to Larry; his social skills are improving and he has even used this new, human knowledge in several hacks requiring social engineering. By understanding how people think, Larry discovered, he can anticipate their patterns, passwords, and PINs.\n\nJade is a Buddhist scholar, although her rebellious nature, attachments, and desire for martial power has ostracized her from her family, former dojo, and local templs.  She is now master of her own studies, and has even trained several pupils of her own. Hugo, Soren, and Larry have all received training, although they manifest this teaching in different ways. She lives with a severe bipolar condition; often riding a manic high, she can fall victim to paralyzing depression. Homeless and exiled, Hugo, Larry, and Soren let her move in 6 months ago without ever paying rent. For this she is eternally grateful, and she would do anything to help her friends, even if it meant her life. They, in turn, respect their teacher and are grateful for her training. She is the first female friend Larry has ever had, and he has the utmost respect for her as a person.\n\nHugo is a philosophy punk. Music used to provide a sense of meaning, but recently he has become increasingly disillusioned with the scene. He enrolled in college at Sol Santo State University in August to pursue a degree in Philosophy. The group has seen less and less of him ever since, although they do remain in touch. Hugo moved out of the house, and lives alone in a small apartment near campus. Although a nice guy, he tends to take this to the extreme, giving up most of his money and possessions to others that want or need them more. Before he moved out, he trained heavily in Kung Fu with Jade. Suspecting that martial arts did not contain the answers he sought, Hugo decided to walk a different path.\n\n\n\nSoren Sequra grew up a scion of the Sequra Cartel (of South Texas). Nephew to the head of the cartel, Soren quickly proved adept at networking and gun-running. Several major deals saw him skyrocket through the ranks of his family business. He was dispatched to Sol Santo to make a name for himself, but all his success has come at a price. Soren grew up isolated and never had a childhood. He has always known a paramilitary existence and so he is incredibly paranoid. For the longest time, his only friends were the dice and Lady Luck; he is a compulsive gambler, and loses often. He’s lost and wasted everything and is currently waiting on his family for the next big job, but the cartel isn’t doing so well. Gang wars in Texas have dried up family resources and so Soren finds himself without much of his support system. Instead, he has discovered what life is like with friends instead of business contacts, and he has begun to trust Larry, Hugo, and Jade more than he ever trusted his dangerous gang.\n\nToday is December 21th, 1996. Larry, Jade, and Soren cannot pay the rent. They haven’t paid the rent in three months. Soon, they will be evicted.\n\nSuddenly, news reports interrupt Larry’s home shopping: more violent murders; an emergency broadcast.\n\n“Shit!” he mutters, “these are practically next door!” Five people dismembered less than a mile from the house. It is an unsettling segment...\n\nThe phone rings. Soren answers, hoping it’s finally his next big score. It isn’t. It’s Hugo’s mother. Hugo is dead; he hanged himself last night. \n\nIn a daze, the group attends the funeral. Things are being hurried, the wake is only in the morning, and the burial in the afternoon. There is one major problem: Larry, Jade, and Soren are certain that Hugo would never kill himself. The wake is closed-casket, but Larry opens the lid to see Hugo’s corpse for himself. It is the grisly remains of his hanged friend, Hugo’s face distorted in horrible pain. Larry lets the coffin lids close, and the three bury their friend in the afternoon.\n\nThe next day, they talk to the police, but the death is ruled a suicide and the group told to accept the facts. Christmas suicides are very common. There was no sign of foul play. It’s a tragedy to be sure, but some people just can’t handle living.\n\nShunned by the police, they begin to plan an investigation of their own.\n\nAt night they decide to break into Hugo’s apartment. The streets are dark, and a chilling ocean breeze cuts through the group’s light jackets. Hugo’s place is unlocked, the police clearly didn’t give much of a shit about this one. Just another Christmas-season surprise waiting for the landlord to clear-out, re-paint, and re-carpet.\n\nHugo’s studio looks just like it did when the group helped him move in 4 months ago. The walls are bare, boxes still sit in corners, and clothes litter the floor. Hugo doesn’t even have a TV. \n\nJade finds a picture of Hugo with three friends… but no one recognizes the two girls and guy in the shot. They turn over every piece of trash in the apartment, and Larry finds what looks like a computer monitor in the closet. However, he recognizes it as a self-sufficient computer system; it just needs a keyboard, which is also in the closet. The police must have thought the actual computer was missing, but Larry easily searches the hard drive. He finds a file, “README.txt,” on the desktop:\n\n\"If you are reading this, I am dead. I will have been killed by true agents of evil, but I do not know who they are, except that they are close. At strange times I feel the stare of unseen eyes and I know that at these moments that it is my killer’s gaze that unnerves me so. I see my death in the pattern of seagulls on the sidewalk and drops of water in the air.\n\nLook to the…\n\nLook to yourselves. Evil lives in Sol Santo.\"\n\nThe friends read over the note several times. It confirms their suspicions: Hugo was murdered. The letter mentions that Hugo’s killer might be close to him, and with only a strange photograph to go on, the group notice that the people in the picture are wearing Sol Santo State University (SSSU) gear. Larry hacks into the school’s ID-card database and spends an hour identifying all three of Hugo’s friends: Sara Jones, brooding with large eyes; Trevor Williams, long-haired,  athletic, tall; Elizabeth Menos, smiling with hair irreverently covering much of her face. \n\nNone were at the funeral. No one knows any of these people, but Soren thinks he knows someone who does. An old friend and bartender, Adam Blaze, who always seemed to know a little bit about everything and everyone. Outside Hugo’s apartment, there is a payphone. Soren heads outside, alone, to make the call. Blaze doesn’t disappoint--in fact, he is surprised that Soren doesn’t know the SSSU Quarterback, Trevor Williams, who is about to take the team to victory in the Sugar Bowl. He thanks Blaze and hangs up. Pop culture and sports were never Soren’s strong suits.\n\nBack inside, Soren shakes the icy dew from his jacket and Larry gets back to work. Jade stares out the window and watches the silent streets. Larry has his personal issues, but he’s good at what he does and his fingers move fast: deeper in the school’s database he finds Trevor’s address. It’s nearby.\n\nA plan begins to form; Larry and Jade will pretend that Hugo told them about Trevor and ask for help. They will pretend that Hugo always spoke fondly of the day the photograph was taken. Gaining access to Trevor's apartment might allow them to look for clues. One last sweep of Hugo’s apartment yields a jar a change. The group cannot pay rent, so Soren pockets it. Hugo doesn’t need it anymore. \n\nThey walk in silence across frozen streets. \n\nTrevor’s apartment building is unlocked, and the dark stairway has direct access to the Quarterback's door. Soren knocks and immediately the door is opened.\n\n“What the fuck do you want?” he says.\n\n“You’re that Quarterback guy,” Soren begins. He can think of no name to drop except one he knows nothing about. He lies: “Sara Jones told us you might know something about Hugo’s death, we were hoping to talk to you about it.” Trevor is confused. He doesn’t look happy, but he concedes.\n\n“Alright, c'mon inside, let’s talk.” As he says this, Elizabeth Menos elbows past Larry and Jade to enter the apartment. Clearly she’s been here before, and she practically jumps onto the sofa. Trevor stands in the middle of the room, not offering a seat to Soren.\n\nElizabeth is hot. She touched Larry as she pushed him out of her way. Larry’s phobia of females kicks in and he feels his pulse increase. His vision goes black, his hearing fades, and he slumps down in the full effects of a panic attack. Jade has his back, and she stays with Larry, making sure he doesn’t hit his head.\n\nThe door slams shut.\n\nInside the apartment, Soren faces an impatient Trevor and an obviously bored Elizabeth. He’s paranoid and senses that these people mean business. He’s outnumbered. He’s out of ideas. Jade and Larry were supposed to do the talking on this one. He runs out of the room, hiding in the shadows of the stairway.\n\nJade shakes Larry. “Stop it! Larry she’s just a girl! I’m a girl and you’re not freaking out! C’mon man we gotta go now!” She catches the door as it’s about to slam shut and pulls Larry into the room with her. Larry tenses his jaw, but manages to back-up Jade. They tell a sad story about Hugo and Sara and the photograph.\n\n“O fuck this!” Screams Elizabeth. She flips the coffee table at Jade and Larry, but our friends have fast reflexes and catch the table in mid air, then slam it to the floor, splintering it into thousands of shards! Elizabeth pulls a wicked axe from under the sofa’s cushions. Larry draws a sword from his long jacket. Elizabeth swings her axe wide, aiming to decapitate him. Larry turns, but the axe strikes a gash across his torso and inch deep and blood covers his clothes. The ax scrapes the bones of his rib cage. The pain is like lightning. \n\nLarry returns the blow and Elizabeth dodges back, but not enough! He cuts across her face and hits her teeth hard, knocking one out.\n\nTrevor charges Jade and punches her in the face. She punches him back, and the two size each other up as they prepare for mortal combat.\n\nSorin is locked in the hallway. He draws his 9mm, shoots the lock, and kicks the door as hard as he can. The door doesn’t budge. \n\nElizabeth spits out a broken tooth and grins at Larry. The awful look sends chills down his spine, exacerbated by his fear of females. He stares in shock as she nearly chops off his arm. Luckily, Larry gains control at the last second and jumps behind Trevor’s massive 48-inch television but still takes a nasty ax cut to the arm. He holds his torso wound closed and attacks back, and with a series of strikes he forces Elizabeth near the splintered coffee table and finished his flurry of attack with a high kick that knocks her down. A wooden spike stabs through her leg, and Larry tells her to stay down. She parries his sword away and curses as she throws down a smoke grenade, instantly filling the room with a thick cloud.\n\nTrevor tackles Jade, intending to break her back, but she remembers her training and goes limp, letting the soft carpet absorb much of the attack. Still, her shoulder is dislocated but it’s better than a broken spine.\n\nSoren kicks the door again and it flies open. He sees Trevor and Jade fighting nearby and shoots at Trevor, but the athlete’s reflexes are impressive, and he rolls out of the way and onto his feet. As he fires, he sees Elizabeth sprint out of the room at an impressive speed. \n\nLarry slashes with his katana, but Trevor dodges again!\n\nJade jumps into into the smoke cloud and launches a flying kick at Trevor. She kicks his head against the nearby apartment wall, dazing him, giving him a concussion, and breaking his skull.\n\nOutmatched with Elizabeth gone, he understand how this battle is going to end if he keeps fighting. He wants to live. he has no choice. He puts up his hands, “Holy shit, don’t kill me. I don’t even know who the fuck you people are.”\n\n“Dude, we did not want to kill you!” Jade cries, still on guard. \n\n“You’re a damn good fighter,” offers Soren, gun still in hand.\n\n“Obviously you guys are as well.”\n\n“Tell us about Hugo!”\n\n“Hugo killed himself,” and Trevor laughs.\n\n“Bullshit! Tell us who killed him!”\n\nLaughing: “You guys have no idea what’s going on do you?” \n\nTrevor is cut short because his head explodes into bits of bone and brain. Soren’s paranoia takes control: the thought of Trevor getting a fast one on the group is too much and Soren panics. He pulls the trigger.\n\n“Nice one Soren, not like we needed to hear what he had to say.” The room is covered in blood. The smoke dissipates slowly.\n\nSoren knows he fucked up, but ignores the his friends’ sarcasm and searches Trevor’s apartment anyway. Finding two thousand in cash, at least the group can pay rent. \n\n***\n\nWith the sounds of sirens in the distance, the three run as fast as they can across the frozen concrete.  Soon, Larry starts to fall behind. Jade and Soren practically carry him as the emergency vehicles get closer. Soren drops a quarter from Hugo’s jar into the nearest payphone and calls his contact.\n\n“Adam, listen fast, my friend is dying. I need a doctor. I can’t go to the hospital.”\n\nAdam thinks for only a second: “Start walking to midcity, I’ll page you the address of a black market surgeon, Zhang Qiang. He owes me a favor, so I’ll give him a call and let him know you’re on your way.”\n\n“Thanks…” but Blaze had already hung up the phone. Soren got the page in a few minutes, and soon they were in a twisting industrial area of solid concrete and not much planning. Tucked amidst warehouses and unmarked buildings the group pounds on a door and it opens. \n\nZhang is very tall and has a head scar, as if the entire top of his skull has been removed at some point. An intense calm is evident in all of his movements. Already he is dressed in scrubs and leads the group to an operating table inside this large warehouse. A chainsaw sits on the floor nearby, doing little to inspire confidence. Nevertheless, he stitches Larry’s cuts and sets Jade’s shoulder in a sling. \n\n“You guys can sleep here,” he says, “we’ll talk in the morning.” He grabs the chainsaw and walks off into the dark warehouse without looking back.\n",

        "text": "Allow me to preface by saying that I'm the GM for this bunch of misfits. We're playing Pathfinder 3.5 after trying 13th Age and D&amp;D 5e, both of which we found to be either not in-depth enough or way too much of a throwback to 9th grade Algebra class. \n\nI've posted another story for this group, which was called [The Little Ranger Who Could.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3te78l/pathfinder_the_little_ranger_who_could/) This actually takes place before that story, since Karasu's still ~~has some bones intact~~ in the party. Anyway, here's the basics.\n\n*Setting*\n\nA large high-fantasy world. High elves, wood elves, orcs, tengu, catfolk, dragonkin, and two different breeds of humans. Big bad human empire to the north, peaceful human republic to the south, dwarven mountain-realm in between. The scope of this setting is actually so large that it can realistically only take place within one or two regions, which is exactly how I like it (because I can break the story into short-term chapters which complement the long-term plot and are based on the players' actions in the regions).\n\nThis world is named Aodharion. This little story takes place on the Emeric Sea, the ocean on the west side of the continent.\n\n*Characters*\n\n**Karasu Shortbeak:** A male tengu rogue/ranger multiclass. Level 6, two levels in ranger, four in rogue. Started as rogue, then took ranger levels because he found that he loved travel almost as much as his precious \"shinies.\" Look up kleptomaniac in the dictionary, and you'll find Karasu giving you a smug grin as he tosses your coinpurse from hand to hand. Very confident, very restless, very excitable.\n\n**Dragh:** A male orc sorcerer with the Undead bloodline. His bloodline manifests itself through slow gangrene and necrosis (which he hides under many, many bandages and is extremely painful), but in exchange for taking half his HP that he would normally get upon levelling, he can raise a number of undead equal to his Hit Dice (total levels) every day. They last for twenty-four hours and are never intelligent. Despite the excruciating pain he's normally in, Dragh is quite kind and polite to a fault, even apologizing to someone if he raises their corpse or kills them.\n\n**Alaine Dremgast:** A female wood elven alchemist hell-bent on converting iron to gold without the use of arcane or divine arts. She obsesses over her alchemy, spending most (if not all) of her gold on ingredients and potions to further her research. Whenever she's not working on her projects, she likes to sit somewhere quiet and read a book. If she doesn't have one, then she seeks out the nearest person (or intelligent creature) and tries her hardest to strike up a conversation with him, her, or it. Very protective of her materials, and has actually been arrested for murder twice (and released later) because someone tried to \"steal\" her things and nobody could prove otherwise.\n\n**Gerry Tundee:** A male human fighter/bard that absolutely loves the sounds bowstrings make when they loose arrows, and consequently has anywhere from five to twenty bows of all shapes and sizes on him at all times. Has known Alaine for a very long time and is slightly deformed (his skin is pitted and a rather stomach-turning shade of orange). He plays his music on instruments made of bows, and collects them. He has no qualms about lending them out as long as the lenders return them unharmed. Keeps a journal almost religiously.\n\n*The Story*\n\nSince everybody's on the same continent, water travel isn't nearly as big as modes of land travel. Still, it's useful, and has a small market, which mainly focuses on sailing from southern parts of the continent to the north in order to avoid the mountain ranges and nasty swamps in between. The party is trying to track down a pirate lord who's put a bounty on their heads for stealing some of his loot, and to that end, they've hired a ship that's been recently rechristened from \"The Dragon's Claw\" to \"The Melody Bucket.\"\n\n...Don't look at me, my players suggested the name.\n\nAnyway, it took them a while to figure out that The Melody Bucket wasn't a tavern, and once they did, Alaine was understandably apprehensive. They'd be potentially sailing this ship into a pirate lord's territory, so if the crew wasn't any good in a fight, the party'd be more or less fucked. Gerry's very interested, since the \"Melody\" part of the name suggests some involvement with music. Karasu is staggered that ships are even a thing (since 99.9% of the people he's ever known can just fly wherever they need to go, including across bodies of water,) and Dragh is worrying that the salt water will agitate his \"wounds.\" By agitate, I mean he'd be in agony if he ever fell into the water, or if any of it got on him. Rotting, open flesh does not mix well with salt at all.\n\nSo they come to the port where the ship is docked, and meet the captain. He turned out to be one of Gerry's cousins (he's got quite a few; a running joke is that if you walk out into the street, close your eyes, and fire an arrow, Gerry'll have to attend a funeral in the next few days). Gerry, realizing that he's going to be spending a few weeks with a friendly relative, is content, and the captain actually lowers the price for his sake.\n\nFast forward a week. Things seem to be going normally. Karasu is roosting in the rigging, heaving his guts over the side. Dragh is curled up under three layers of blankets, terrified that some small amount of salt is going to cause him unendurable pain. Alaine is snooping around, trying to test the mettle of this crew at every opportunity, and Gerry's having a fucking blast. Drinking, some light singing, and friends of a close cousin? He's happy.\n\nThen, at some point during the night, the navigator starts humming a tune. Then, the captain starts humming along. The watchmen on deck start humming, The guy in the crow's nest (hehehe, tengu pun) starts humming. The cook, the first mate, the quartermaster... this humming spreads like the goddamn Black Plague. Alaine is freaking out, thinking they're under an enchantment, Karasu isn't paying attention, Dragh is sharing Alaine's fear, and Gerry...\n\nGerry whips out one of his bowstring lutes.\n\nOver the next four hours, the crew goes from being normal sailors to a fifty-man orchestra. From every conceivable container, instruments are produced, with the captain conducting. They were basically singing the shanties from AC: Black Flag, but with significantly more instrumental accompaniment.\n\nAlaine and Dragh are panicking when they finally finish, and it takes Gerry, his cousin, and three other sailors to convince them that they just really enjoy music. After a bit of digging, Alaine finds out that the entire crew (including the captain) are actually alumni of the Songmaster's Academy, the equivalent of the Bards' College (from Skyrim? Anyone?). They were all buddies in the vocals &amp; strings classes, and when they graduated, decided to adventure around, eventually getting their hands on a ship and making no small amount of coin serenading passengers and transporting cargo.\n\nFast forward three weeks, and six more impromptu performances.\n\nThe Bucket encounters three ships flying the same black flag, and if the party had any doubts as to who the ships belonged to, cannon shot dispelled them pretty quickly. Battle breaks out on the high seas.\n\nI actually gave my players control of different aspects of the Melody Bucket; Dragh was on guns, and reanimated killed pirates from afar, which created a considerable amount of chaos on the opposing ships. Alaine was 'first mate;' in reality, her player was steering the ship. Karasu was in charge of flying over to opposing ships and fucking up their rigging, and Gerry...\n\nFucking Gerry, man.\n\nI start getting PMs from Gerry's player (let's call him Mark). He asks me if the crew members count as bards. I say not really, since they don't have any magical capabilities, and he asks me if he can extend the buffs from his bardic performance to them. I make him roll a Perform check, and he passes marvelously.\n\nGerry the Bowstring Bard used his cousin's crew as amps.\n\nThe entire crew, including the party (and a kobold stowaway) got buffed with +5 to hit and sonic damage on hit. Because it was a great idea, the cannons got buffed too. Sonic quasi-homing cannon shot.\n\nThe pirates were quickly regretting their life choices.",

        "text": "The first ever roleplaying group I was part of was a d20 Modern/homebrew campaign. The setting was modern day with heavy World of Darkness elements. Our group’s PCs consisted of the following\n\n* Ignatius (a gunfighter, played by me)\n* Talon, (Catholic priest with healing abilities)\n* Venna, (part time dominatrix and assassin) \n* JB (tech guy and forgery artist)\n* James (martial artist with some monk powers)\n\n\nWe had been contracted/coerced by a vampire lord to recover parts of an ancient grimoire from a secret society of demon worshipers. Previously we had found one of them hidden in the Astral Plane and tangled with a Fey warrior wherein I accidentally killed another PC with a shotgun. James had recovered a very powerful great axe of frost from the Fey warrior. The axe ended up being sentient and exerting substantial control over James, driving him into bloodlust and killing rages. Up to this point, it hadn't been a problem since he only dropped into the bloodrage when he was in combat with enemies. Our DM was making him take willpower saves at the start and end of combat to be able to control his anger.  \n\nThe second portion of the book was on a hidden military base in the north eastern US. After reaching the area and doing some scouting we planned our entry. The base had a high powered electric fence and guards posted on towers at regular intervals. So we sent our two stealthy characters, Talon and James to cut the power to the fence and make an escape route. Meanwhile, myself, Venna and JB would commandeer a vehicle destined for the base, eliminate the occupants and steal their uniforms to bluff our way in.  \n\nTalon and James make it to the fence without being spotted at night. Meanwhile, we managed to successfully steal a vehicle and by the blessings our merciful DM, the passengers had uniforms that sort of fit us. Driving up to the gate was a nerve wracking experience, but a couple of good bluff rolls and smoky eyes from Venna get us through. As soon as we get in we ditch the vehicle and start searching the buildings for any sign of ancient grimoires. \n\nAt the fence line though, Talon and James' luck has run out. They had shorted out and cut through the fence without a problem, but were quickly spotted when going through the hole. Acting quickly, James pulls out his axe and vaults up the ladder to the guard tower. His plan was just to knock the guard out, but he fails his willpower save and proceeds to dismember the guy. And then he fails his save to stop combat and continues chopping and hacking, all the while screaming bloody murder. \n\nTalon sees this is a problem and climbs up the tower to talk James down. James is having none of it and continues to brutalize the body, while the frost axe whispers sweet nothings in his mind. Talon realizes that this is going to attract attention, so he goes all out, trying to grab the axe from James' hands. Big mistake. James shoves him away and makes an attack, swinging the axe upwards to the groin, getting an unfortunate critical. Talon is split from balls to brain. He is then pitched out of the guard tower and onto the electric fence. The fact that it was shorted out wasn't much comfort to him. \n\nSo of course all this commotion leads to us all getting captured. We were nearly used as summoning vessels for demonic soldiers, but a lucky intervention from another group of hunters got us out. After that we traveled to China wherein we used a toy submarine to cross an underground lake filled with flesh eating slugs. This story shall also be told.  \n\n\n",

        "text": "Cast of Characters:\nUrgaan - Orc barbarian\nGimmdren - Dwarf ranger\nDaenelis - Elf Ranger\nGylwynn - Elf Rogue\nMe - DM\n\nI intend this to be the beginning of a series of posts as the campaign discussed in this post is still going on and after each session (unless nothing remarkable happened) I will post the next chapter is what I have decided to call \"The Urgaan Chronicles\". Expect new posts on Saturdays. Now, on to the story.\n\nI'm currently DMing an online 3.5e campaign via Roll20. Todays chapter is about the party's adventures in a small introductory dungeon for their characters. In the first room of the dungeon were 7 kobolds around a fire, not wanting to face them head on, Daenelis tried to sneak around the kobolds, and succeeded. He hid in the doorway to the next room, little did he know, there were two more kobolds in there. But he somehow managed to succeed in a hide check, even though he was literally 10 feet away from the kobolds, in a torchlit room, with the kobolds looking directly at him. Daenelis quickly dispatched the 2 kobolds and then sneak attacked one of the other group. Soon afterwards the rest of the party came in and quickly dealt with the rest of the kobolds. But before the party could kill them all, one of the kobolds managed to get a natural 20, then another natural 20 on his crit confirmation roll... and then rolled a 3 for damage and did a total of 6. So the party moved into the next room, where Daenelis was ambushed by an assassin vine that brought him down to only a few HP, but while the rest of the party was fighting, Gimmdren just kind of left, and went to explore another room. In that room he found 3 barrels which he promptly looted, all the while his companions were fighting to save Daenelis from the assassin vine. This post actually covers two sessions, and after the first session  Daenelis's player had to leave the group do to real world problems, so the rest of this post will not contain him. It's possible he will return eventually though. So after killing the assassin vine, the party decided they would go through the door to the next room. But first I noticed that Gylwynn was using a bastard sword, I asked her why an elf rogue was using a bastard sword, and she said that she had exotic weapons proficiency. The rest of the party was about 80% sure that a bastard sword wasn't an exotic weapon so I looked it up, and sure enough, it was. Someone made a joke about her being a ninja because she used mostly exotic weapons and we spent about 10 minutes discussing ninjas with bastard swords. Once they finally got through the door, they saw a young blue dragon (they were a  low level party). Gylwynn and Gimmdren  began to fight the dragon head on, while Urgaan snuck up behind it... even though he was a barbarian and Gylwynn was a rogue... yeah I didn't understand their reasoning either. So Urgaan tries to sneak up behind the dragon, and rolls a natural 1, so he slips on a wet rock, but his modifiers made him still succeed because the dragon was distracted. So Urgaan tried to move silently, fell over, and still succeeded. At first I didn't say what he slipped on, so he asked \"Did I slip on a bucket?\" and I responded with \"No, a wet rock, why would there be a bucket here?\" to which he responded with \"THERE IS ALWAYS A BUCKET!\" which has since become his catchphrase. After killing the dragon they went back to town, the first place they stopped was the general store to get some gems appraised. At the general store Urgaan asked me \"Are there any buckets in the shop?\" I told him that there are and he quickly followed up the question with \"Do any of the buckets have gems on them?\" to which I said something I never thought I would have to say \"No Urgaan, you cannot have a jewel encrusted bucket.\"",

        "text": "Let me tell you a tale. A tale of... Well, you read the title, it's an epic tale of almost complete derailment of a whole campaign. But before we begin, let me introduce you to the victims of Snakebutt's wrath.\n\nJack: Our benevolent GM\n\nTom (Me): Tark Blackwing, Void Master, Master Helmsman, winged human mutant\n\nJames: Einar Frostclaw, Arch Militant, Twistcatcher, minorly corrupted human\n\nLee: Volgus Metallus, Tech Priest, Enginseer Prime\n\nEmily: Navigator, can't remember other details.\n\nSo, let us begin our tale. We were tasked with delivering a map to another Rogue Trader by a map salesman, in exchange for a map of a small system that we needed to visit. Last known location: Footfall. You might know the place. Void settlement, centered around an enormous statue of the most holy God Emperor. Our lovely Arch Militant, already slightly corrupted because of his obsession with sex, and moving toward full blown heresy, makes a blasphemous comment, along the lines of \"Fuck the Emperor\". GM decides that this means a full blown d20 roll of corruption points...\n\nNatural. Fucking. 20.\n\nThis leads to Einar not only gaining another 2 malignancies, but a full blown mutation, listed here in order of importance.\n\nA distaste for iconography of the Emperor, causing nausea at the sight of it.\nA snake tail instead of legs, hence the lovely nickname of Snakebutt.\nBloodlust, causing potential rage when attacked or at the end of battle.\n\nNow, all these things should have been manageable, if a little brutal. Einar was still playable... But, the luck of the roll was not strong with James. As we continued our search for the recipient of this map, another Rogue Trader by the name of Xiao, who we'd found out was currently in a drug den on the lower levels.\n\nWe arrive there, but the bouncers won't let us in. Snakebutt makes some... Choice comments about the specific clientele of the establishment, bringing a punch his way from the bouncers... James fails his roll, engage bloodlust. After he completely incinerates one bouncer with his Long Las, we attempt to non-lethally subdue him... With the exception of our Navigator, who opens fire with a bolter. However, Snakebutt is a tough son of a bitch, and withstands and dodges whatever we throw at him. \n\nLong story short, he was a little bit tanky, and did a fuck ton of damage with the long las... Enough to one shot EVERY party member. Luckily, we all have fate points to burn, and none of us die, except me, but fortunately I make my toughness roll, and survive.\n\nCasualty Report:\nOne bouncer, incinerated\nTark Blackwing, unconscious, missing right leg\nVolgus Metallus, unconscious, missing left leg\nNavigator, unconscious, unmaimed.\n\nLuckily, after almost killing all of us, James makes his roll, and Snakebutt calms down, otherwise we'd all have been finished off. He heals us all up with our medipacks that we all had. Shit proceeds to kick off. The Tech Priest is yelling, I'm yelling, we are all on the verge of killing Snakebutt. But, we calm down, but send him in first, in case the occupants of the drug den aren't glad to see a murderous, snake-tailed mutant.\n\nFunnily enough, they weren't. They pump a few shots into him, barely a scratch on him thanks to bad rolls and his armor... But again, he fails his roll, bloodlust round 2 engages. The rest of the crew didn't want to deal with his shit, and walked out. \n\nSnakebutt throws a grenade, takes out half the room. I shoot him with my bolter... And miss. The room however, unloads into him, stunning and almost killing him. I fire again... And miss. Room fires, takes him into critical damage, he drops unconscious. The inhabitants all drop behind makeshift barricades, as I attempt the Coups de Grace... And miss... Twice. The third shot however, completely obliterates him. Red mist. Nothing left at all.\n\nSnakebutt was finally destroyed. The occupants saw me, floating above this red mess that was Snakebutt using the wings, because of the whole missing leg thing. As they were all high as kites, they weep at this angel of the Emperor, sent to destroy the mutant menace. Hence, the legend of the Angel of Vengeance. But that isn't why this session will be remembered.\n\nFor the legend of Snakebutt the Destroyer shall live on, in the hearts of our crew. Mostly out of fear, and what happens when bad rolls happen at the right time.",

        "text": "In some fantasy bullshit Austria-Hungary alternate history setting, a team of adventurers is not having a super great day. Having just busted a big-time prisoner out of a high-security prison and making off with a large amount of shiny things, they now had a large force of RATHER IRATE soldiers on their asses. Seeing as they did not enjoy cool, refreshing breezes passing through their internal organs, they decided they needed an edge.\n\nAnd so they enter Happy Happy Village, in the Peaceful Rest valley. Rumor had it that the place was infested with sinister cultists. This turned out to be rather disturbingly true, as every goddamn person they ran into started preaching \"old gods\" gospel and handing out pamplets in the manner of extremely inconsiderate jehovah's witnesses. A cursory examination by magic revealed that they were under a very slight compulsion, as though they were being mani, uh, [manipulated](http://earthbound.wikia.com/wiki/Evil_Mani_Mani) or something. So naturally the party decided, fuck that noise, let's just move along without getting involved in any way, or doing any investigations. Fair enough, it wasn't like they were being paid or anything.\n\nBut the subject of compulsions and the widespread cult activity did raise a serious issue. Namely, every institution that was normally run by sane people was now being run by crazed cultists. Inns, item shops, churches, mail centers, military bases, it was cultists all the way down. Except for one...\n\nThere was, in fact, one individual that had managed to keep out of the whole \"cult\" business and avoid getting a magical compulsion slapped on their brain. The owner of the magic item shop! It was relatively simple to find, they just had to enter the one building that was decorated with \"KEEP OUT\" and \"SOLICITORS WILL BE VAPORIZED\" instead of the usual mind-numbing propaganda about some 'old gods'. And find it they jolly well did, and were quick in talking the rather screwy tengu shopkeeper into item-sale mode instead of shotgun-wielding mode.\n\nTurns out that the twitchy tengu had an item that would whisk them away from this atrocious attempt at a subplot, but A) it would cost them some cash, B) it may or may not run on the souls of orphans, and C) that fellow in the doorway looks like he wants to have a word with you. The party, to their dismay, found that there was indeed a cheery halfling standing in the doorway, being upbeat and nonthreatening. Alarms started going off in the heads of every party member there, up until the awkward and meandering small talk was cut short by a hostile rogue tripping over a rack of potions and faceplanting onto the scene.\n\nSo the assassins turned to plan B: Wizard. A dwarf stepped out from around the doorway and casted Black Tentacles on everything. Which ALSO didn't work. PLAN C! PLAN C!\n\nCombat began, with the party up against a trio of bounty hunters- Rogue, Monk, Wizard. The wizard instantly proved to be the biggest hassle, casting spells that bogged the party down in difficult terrain, entanglement and status effects. Black Tentacles! Web! Color Spray! The party's two sorcerers were immediately wrapped up and incapacitated while the enemy monk and rogue charged in, avoiding the hastily-put-together interference from the party. The enemy rogue was keeping the party sorcerer down, except that the bastard kept using spells without somatic components to send little balls of fire into the rogue's face. Rude. Meanwhile, the party's OTHER sorcerer, who excelled in mind fuckery, incapacitated the enemy wizard with Hideous Laughter and completely failed to get out of her web bindings. That left two main combatants- the cheery halfling monk against the party's Vitalist, a Duergar built like an exteremly grouchy tank.\n\nIN THIS CORNER, A PISSY DUERGAR WITH HUGE HP, NEWFANGLED RAGE POWERS, LIFESTEALING ATTACKS, BUT LOW DAMAGE OUTPUT! IN THE OTHER CORNER, A HALFLING MONK WITH INCREDIBLE DEXTERITY AND LITTLE STRENGTH, WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF ATTACKS AND FANTASTIC DEFENSES!\n\n***AND THIS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IS ROCK 'EM SOCK 'EM MIDGETS!***\n\nWith that, the two started whaling on eachother with all the energy of their blue and red counterparts, throwing punch after punch after punch after PUNCH AFTER PUNCH AFTER PUNCH AFTER\n\nYou get the idea. Needless to say, teeth flew everywhere, and the fight generally went nowhere. That is, until the enemy rogue managed to win his fight, despite his wide array of poisons doing exactly jack and shit against the webbed-up fire sorcerer. The other sorcerer, who was STILL caught up in the web, managed to contribute only by ocasionally slapping a healing spell on the allied fistfighter whenever his HP dropped too low. But now she was out of spells. That just left the Duergar Vitalist with the busy fists, who had just gotten KO'd by the halfling when his rage finally ran out.\n\nAnd at that exact moment, the party Gunslinger walked in the door with a big paper sack full of fast food.\n\nTaking stock of the situation, he stepped over the still-manically-laughing Dwarf Wizard, whipped out his gun and shot at the enemy monk. And wouldn't you know, it was the exact WRONG moment to get a critical failure. So he spends a turn backing up, fires again, AND CRIT FAILS AGAIN. He had to resort to using his backup shortsword like a fucking philistine. And the kicker? IT WORKED. Barely managing to stay conscious at 0hp, he knocked out the halfling, who was teetering at two hit points, and knocked out the enemy rogue with a lucky blow.\n\nWhich was when the Laughing Dwarf finally made his freakin' will save.\n\nBy this point, the total health of the party members were universally negative. None of them were dying, though- the bounty hunters had been specifically trying to capture them alive. The Duergar vitalist was barely conscious and fumbling with some bandages, the fire sorcerer had more holes in him than he cared to admit, the tricky sorceress was STILL COCOONED IN WEBBING and now nearly out of spells, and the gunslinger was barely holding on with a lucky fort save and a gun that wouldn't ever stop jamming. On the plus side, their enemies weren't in much better shape (dead, unconscious and suffering from serious burns, and outnumbered four-to-one, respectively). So the Tricky Sorceress, STILL IN HER COCOON, casted one final spell. Suggestion.\n\n\"Just... leave.\"\n\nWith that, the dwarf failed one last save, grabbed the rogue, and GTFO'd before things could get any more godawful. The party got everyone bandaged up, had some sandwiches, and as an afterthought, finally removed the sorceress from her ball of webbing. Pretty much everyone agreed that this was probably the most retarded bout of combat that they had ever participated in, and that in the future they should have precautions against surprise assassination and AOE web spells. The Tengu Shopkeeper offered scathing advice, cold popcorn, and the goddamn magic carpet that was the reason they were all here in the first place.\n\nThey blasted the fuck out of there at maximum speed, let me fuckin' tell you. By now, they were COMPLETELY done with this entire business. The prison break, the racism, the inconsistent accents, the war, the cults, the assassins, the angry dragons, the goddamn solid steel dire honey badgers, the cheesy superheroes, all of it. FAREWELL, GOOD DAY SIR.\n\nThus ended Mister Numbers' running of the normally-serious campaign, called Gods and Machines, orchestrated by /u/djinn900.",

        "text": "So this was my first ever campaign in a tabletop game and it was the same for the others in the group. Our DM was our best friend and he was very experienced. He decided to introduce us to tabletops as he had found all his old pathfinder stuff from years before. So we all get together and we start playing with a large group.\nOur initial group was huge, as we had thrown a party and drank to get us pumped for the game. We had a chaotic evil Anti-Paladin, a neutral good wizard, a chaotic neutral rogue, a lawful good cleric, a chaotic good witch, a neutral good ninja, and me who was a good gladiator. After the first session, the anti paladin didn't want to play as the nights we played his girlfriend wanted to hang out(she would do this on purpose because she hated us), the cleric and witch were brothers and they got so drunk that night they were secretly banned from being over again(both were homosexual and when drunk one ran out the door naked screaming, while the other would openly and aggressively attempt to sleep with our DM who is a macho pure straight man. Made him uncomfortable and chasing the other down was no fun), leaving only the ninja, rogue, wizard, and me. \nSo in the quest, we were hunting down a werewolf who was plotting to curse the entire city with lycanthropy. After looking for clues to who was the werewolf secretly all day, we went to our inn/tavern to relax. Our Wizard trying to be funny tries to pick up a bar maid, and rolls a 2 failing it. So the ninja being the good friend he is, tries to talk her into it, rolling a 12. She then says she will go upstairs with the wizard, but only for 10 gold. Now some context here, we are BROKE. We are saving up for some silver or something of the sort to help us in our efforts to stopping the werewolf so we are drinking and eating to a minimum. So the wizard decides to splurge to get some bar maid. \nSo with our DM being the funny guy as he has, he makes the wizard roll a fort save to see if he does well. The wizard fails it and goes limp. The wizard decides to use the spell telekinesis to keep it up to get the most out of his ten gold. \nDuring that time, the 3 of us downstairs end up in the always classic tavern brawl due to the rogue trying to steal some money from some unsavory people. We do well but before killing someone, the town guards rush in to stop the fun. The guards give us a warning as they rightfully blame the fight on us, and let us go on our way. So we decide to go upstairs and check on the wizard.\nThe wizard is just finishing up his time with the bar maid when he has the sudden instinct to roll a perception check as the barmaid never fully took off her clothes and just opened the skirt up. He realizes it's no woman as it's a man in drag and panics as we walk in. The bar maid panics too and tries to run away, so the ninja not knowing what's going on throws a ninja star at her to stop her. He rolls a nat 20... So down goes the decapitated bar maid. \nNow we are all panicking as one of our own committed a murder for no reason we check the body to see if there is anything on it. We find 25 gold pieces and then while I am trying to think of what to do, the other 3 vote to toss the body out the window as we are on the second floor. They do so, and the body lands on the guards who just left the tavern after breaking up our fight...\nSo the situation could not get any worse in my minds as the guards go up to our room along with the bar's owner. The guards threaten us with jail time and execution but the bar owner asks how much gold she had on her. We explain that the wizard paid 10 but there was 25 total on her. The bar keep then has an \"A HA\" moment as he explains that he suspected her of stealing money from the tavern and her having extra pocket gold on her would make sense. He tells the guards not to worry about the bar maid and that these adventurers deserve a reward for stopping the thief. \nMy jaw is on the floor at the incredible luck the DM tossed our way. The bar owner gives us 200 gold and sends us on our way. I small tear moves down my eye in game and we went onwards to hunt down the werewolf like it never happened. Looking back, it's no wonder the anti-paladin's then girlfriend didn't like us.",

        "text": "Some time ago I began a subreddit for this very thing, /r/PaegaRPG, and discontinued it due to personal issues at the time. The project is once again operational. For those who are unfamiliar with the project, it is an attempt to create an RPG world in which anyone can play in and interact with anything that they want, including other players. The rule system that is going to be used is a modified version of [Dominion Rules](http://dominionrules.org/). Players will generate their own characters and can essentially do what every they want as long at it's within the rules. Meaning that Hendersons are strongly discouraged, but still technically allowed.\n\nThe lore is available on the subreddit thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PaegaRPG/comments/3z1k91/subreddit_activity_has_now_resumed_now_recruiting/), but I'll leave it here as well if all you want is an idea of the setting. If you have any questions regarding how the project is going to be carried out, please direct them to the main thread.\n\nHope to play with you soon!\n\nJajuna, an island in the clouds. First discovered in 1932 by an Englishman via Blimp, it was quickly flooded with large groups of scientists of every kind trying to figure out exactly why and how a 300 mile diameter island was floating around the world on a cloud that supported the island and nothing else. Even more baffling was the existence of several large ruined temples, seeming to have the architectural style of the ancient Mayans. There is currently no scientifically feasible theory on how the island is able to exist up in the sky, and no idea how the ruins got there or where the builders came from or went.\n\nDuring the start of World War 2, the island was floating over England at the time and was commandeered, turning into an Allied Air Base and a camp for refugees from the war. Once the war had ended, the Military presence stayed, as did a large portion of the refugees. As time passed by and Jajuna traversed the world, many different people from many different ethnic groups settled on the island and the military presence quickly became a major policing force to combat the massive amount of organized crime which was carried out by an increasingly unruly populace. Due to an increasing amount of brutality, uncalled for shootings and executions, the populace revolted, exterminating the remaining members of the military and banning on pain of death any firearm in order to prevent what they consider to be a “streamlining of slaughter.”\n\nDeclaring independence in 1964, it settled on a ruling Council of Nine that managed each large city on the island, creating a Senate that made nation-wide decisions. This quickly descended into a highly confusing mass of government corruption and mafia-like “Families” who maintained relatively tight-knit groups, claimed their various territories and fought among each other and against the other Families. Despite this constant feuding, there was one thing all the Families held in common: a xenophobic attitude towards “Worlders,” a slur referring to anyone who wasn't a natural-born citizen of the island. In a rather bizarre cultural turn, religious Worlders have begun to idolize the Islanders as pure beings due to their life in the sky, and often consider them to be angels themselves. News of this only caused Islanders to look down on Worlders even further and planted a seed of that particular train of thought in the minds of the general population.\n\nIn an attempt to maintain a “Pure and Breathable Atmosphere,” something Islanders think that the Worlders lack, the Senate banned gasoline-powered transportation, limiting travel to horses, bikes, electric cars, etc. in 1996, accidentally beginning a Balkinization process which would greatly weaken the central authority of the Senate.\n\nThe Senate has been able to keep a very careful eye on who is able to enter and leave as the only way off the island is through the air. Only those who are considered “worthy” are permitted to enter the island and become a citizen, though the exact details of what “worthy” is is quite fuzzy.",

        "text": "Hey guys, I just found this sub and I wanted to share a story with you:\n\nThis was only the second campaign I'd ever played and for two of the other guys it was their first.  We are all friends are this one though, so everyone is patient with everyone, especially since I had only played in 3rd edition before this and we were transitioning into 4th.  One of the new guys even got into the idea of character roleplaying right away, which not only was awesome for him, but really pressured the rest of us to up our game.\n\nThere were some cool things that happened before the moment I'm going to tell, like how our group of six sneaked into a cultist's mansion, found a coliseum used to keep making skeletal warriors, and had the two new guys (a minotaur full-plated paladin and warforged spellblade) try and fail a sneak check.  It's become a running joke.\n\nThis story though takes place a couple sessions afterwards. At this point, due to drop-outs and reentries we have:\n*Fionnna: (me) a half-elf bard\n*Stuhak: the GM's answer to us not having a really good striker for the early game.  A mute half-orc barbarian that traveled with Fionna.\n*Keiral: the minotaur paladin\n*Goswald: the warforged spellblade\n*Toos: the changling assassin\n*...And the guy that ended up dropping out and coming back with a thri'keen.  I can't remember what his first character's name was, but he was a wilden.\n\nRegardless, we had been tasked with escorting a healer to a new town knowing that there was a bandit group that was trying to intercept and kill any support.  I volunteer to drive the cart since now that it's 4th edition I can do a majority of my attacks at range and I'm the most fragile of the bunch.  Sure enough when we're getting close to the town about seven bandits rush the cart and the other guys hop out of the cart, prepping their powers for a beat down while I figure out if it's a better option to stay in the cart or hop out to help; the answer comes to me when one of the bandits that aren't being engaged tries to sneak onto the wagon and I pull away.\n\nThe GM is focusing on the fight with the other guys, leaving me at the bottom of the initiative list and thinking about what to do.  I'm just standing and looking over the whole map, trying to figure out my move.  When it finally comes to my turn, I look up at the GM and ask, \"How far can I move in the cart?\"  He looks up the actual chart and decides, \"You can move twenty squares in a turn.\"  I nod; the other guys think that Fionna is about to bail (fairly; she started the game neutral evil) and I ask another question, \"So how many squares can I move if I turn?\"  \"Ah...You can move twelve all together.\"  \"Okay...\n\n...I want to drive the cart over these bandits.\"\n\nI point at the targets, the table goes quiet.  The two new guys look at the GM with absolute panic, not knowing you could do things like this.  The two other veterans just sit back and wait for the ruling.  I can see that the GM never planned for this question and after a beat picks up his books, and after about a minute of silence that I thought he was trying to ignore my question says, \"I'm looking up a damage chart.\"\n\nNeedless to say, in a game where we frequently give a fake award of MVP for fights, taking out two bandits by Tokyo Drifting them in one turns earned the bard the MVP for that fight.",

        "text": "Previous session here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3q2mg0/beyond_the_wall_session_10_of_the_battle_of/\n***\nIt's been some time since I was able to get the group back together, but I've finally done it and compiled two short sessions together into one! The group that has escaped the destruction of Lundenfeld moves on, the Royal Family in their carriage and the current love interests of the others in tow. The destination is the capital city Kirkwall, a journey of nearly a week at best. But danger strikes at every turn as the characters flee through the dark woods, and even closer danger sits amongst the party…\n\nThe Cast of Characters includes:\nLindsey as *Perdenzia, the Fae Foundling*\nDJ as *Arrow, the Would-be Knight*\nCaitlin as *Freya Pendragon Kirkwall, the Forgotten Noble Child*\nRiley as *Caligeth ‘Cal’ Darwinus, the Apprentice Court Sorcerer*\n\nAfter the encounter with the bear, the posse of survivors heading to Kirkwall is more than leery to stop. But after that destructive encounter the group needs a little rest, and the horses have to graze as well. Still far away from their destination, the group pulls aside near a field and allow the horses some respite. As everyone gets out and stretches their legs Arrow wanders off to answer Nature’s call. As the young warrior relieves himself, he is startled to find that he is now surrounded by seven wolves, eyes gleaming maliciously and fur on edge.\n\nThe others are gathered around the carriage and horses, and hear the shouts of their friend. Cal runs over to investigate, seeing what he might be able to do. Utilizing his magical arts of illusion, and the power of his excellent charisma, he manages to startle the wolves into falling back, leaving just two standing defiantly. One is the alpha, and Perry whispers the secret words that allow her to speak with the lower creatures of the world. Meanwhile, Freya hesitantly pets the other wolf.\n\nThe alpha explains the strange plight that had fallen upon them. About a week ago a strange new wolf, one they had never seen, came and forced himself upon the pack with the work of blinding magic and power. This was clearly the guise of some strange spellcaster who inflicted his command upon the pack: let nothing enter or exit the nearby hamlet, kill any who resist. So for the past week the wolves have turned away any merchants or travelers, but are suffering because they cannot leave the close proximity of the settlement without coming down with a strange illness, obviously inflicted as a curse from the spellcaster.\n\nThe party offers their help in freeing the wolves of this magical bond, and inform the stopped group of their intentions. They would wait while the wolves let the small team of adventurers past, at great risk to themselves. The party headed down the path into the hamlet of Tywyn. It didn’t take long until they gain some attention, as an inquisitive local questioned the group in their method of evading the wolf blockade. Arrow the ever eloquent managed to insult the man, who promptly attacked him in anger. The rest of the party restrained the foolish would-be knight and informed the man that they were bounty hunters, and that Arrow was their captured prey. The man, still angered, leaves. The group decides to find out why the town needs to be quarantined like it is, and Perry heads to the meeting hall before being forbidden to enter. During a meeting of elders women are not allowed inside.\nAngered by this slight, Perry and Freya hurry away and quickly disguise themselves well enough to slip through as Cal distracts the two guards with chit-chat. During this Arrow breaks free of his bonds and slips away into the hands of the town guard, who restrain and drag him away to the small holding cell in the sheriff’s home. The rest of the group doesn’t care enough to help him in this case.\n\nPerry (under the alias of Perm) and Freya (under the alias of Fralf) enter into the tent with Cal to discuss the wolf problem with the elders. The elders are talking and enjoying their mead, and the trio get involved as well, though ‘Perm’ stays away from the drink despite the ribbings of the elders. But problems start to arise when ‘Fralf’ starts to enjoy a little too much mead, and jokingly hits one of the guards in a drunken stupor. Cal, feeling both the part of the hero and the strange urging to really impress the assembled peoples with his powerful magic, opens fire with a powerful offensive spell that ignites the guard on fire, causing him to burn before the assembled group. Any semblance of a fun party is lost as panic sets in. Cal is brought back to reality as the steel blade of a guard cuts into him, and Freya jumps up onto the table to flee the tent. Perry hides herself away near some assorted vegetation, waiting for the right moment to strike as Cal stumbles into an elder, tripping the both of them. Cal is stabbed again for his troubles.\n\nOutside Freya stumbles (literally) into the butcher, who tries to hlep who he thinks is a lost drunk girl. She pushes him aside and runs to fetch Arrow from the jail cell, knowing how well he does in a fight. She finds that the sheriff has already gone to investigate the commotion, and picks the lock. After freeing the would-be knight she turns and runs down the road to join her parents.\n\nInside the tent Cal is on his last legs, blood streaming from a half-dozen wounds by the angered guards. But before the hapless mage can be struck down, Arrow bursts through the fabric door, blade glinting in the torch-light as he plunges it into the chest of a guard. The blood flows over the blade, and he feels a strange burst of ecstasy. The blood spatters over a wicked grin on his face. With the advantage in their favor, Cal wrings his hands, casting the magical symbols in the air. A vibrant purple fireball shoots from his hands and incinerates another guard, and the elders are stuck screaming as the tent catches fire. Arrow is stabbed in the back of the leg by a lucky guard, but Perry’s arrow quickly stops him in his tracks, and allows Cal to slice off his ear before Arrow wraps his hands around his throat. Feeling a strange voice egging him on, Arrow watches with glee before the last breath is cast from the guard’s mouth.\n\nHaving made it to her parents, Freya tosses herself at their feet and passes out from all the drink. It is a restless sleep, full of strange red hellscapes of burning fires and ruined kingdoms. A deep thrumming fills her head, a powerful presence that she can’t quite shake. The other feel it too as the elders cower before them, carted out one by one into the courtyard. One tries to protest and Arrow cuts him down, feeling the call of the strange Red Dream.\n\nInside the saddlebag on Cal’s horse, the darkstone thrums, it’s evil presence hard at work...",

In our game alone, we have seen [the GM fuck with us](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2v0x6a/vampire_the_masquerade_why_cellphones_arent/?), we have seen [the dice fuck with the GM](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2syis9/vampire_the_masquerade_the_antidiceshaming_or_how/?ref=search_posts), and we recently have seen [the GM retaliate to even greater levels](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3yc2nc/vampire_the_masquerade_when_the_going_gets_tough/).\n\nBut the best experiences are when we go out of our way to fuck with him in ways that reach out into the real world.\n\nThe following prank is the masterwork of player /u/amagi82, aka Jim. In our game, he plays Captain Thomas Anstis, a pirate-Gangrel with a perfectly irreverent pirate attitude. The brief backstory is this: shit in our city has been going to hell, and NPC Justicar Theo Bell ([yes, *that* Theo Bell](http://whitewolf.wikia.com/wiki/Theo_Bell)) was sent in to take over and try to wrangle some order into things. He thought he'd reached a breakthrough when PC Tom Lytton (Brujah) got captured for fucking up one too many times and thrown into metaphorical carbonite. Problem is, in Tom's absence, PC Captain Anstis has found himself the new scapegoat of many dramas that have exploded around town (sometimes literally). After nights of this, Bell pulled Anstis aside and told him, in no uncertain terms, that, moving forward, he wanted the *full* details of everything that's been going on.\n\nAnstis--and Jim--decided to take him at his word.\n\nAfter over three weeks of planning, we all sat down for our weekly game. Our hapless GM, Jason, was faced with the following scene. If you'd like, the [audio clip here](http://raptor.zombox.org/vampire_recordings/2015_10_08_Anstis_letter.mp3) records what occurred in real time. We recommend listening to it while looking through [the photo gallery here](http://imgur.com/a/xbC13) and reading along with the letter. \n\nOther characters mentioned in the letter:\n\n* Cantor: (NPC) A rogue Black Hand Assamite loose in the city and suspected sire of Tom Lytton's long-lost sister Isabella\n* Karl Sutro: (NPC) Primogen of the Nosferatu, deceased. Killed by accident when Tom Lytton and his werewolf BFF kidnapped him, quote, \"for the lulz\"\n* Admiral Jonathan Flowers: (NPC) Anstis's arch-nemesis, [possibly in that sort of way](http://www.harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=327)\n* Jeremiah Flagg: (NPC) A Hunter Inquisitor, rolls around spouting Bible bullshit and seems impossible to kill\n\nAs always, [full accounts of our games can be found on our blog!](https://sfvampires.wordpress.com)",

Has no idea when he should shut up. Played by yours truly.\n* Buddy and Jim the elven scouts (NPC Allies). I forget why we nicknamed the one Jim, but when we met them I was picturing Buddy as, well, Buddy from Elf. The rest of the party thought that was pretty funny, so it stuck.\n* Wolf, a wolf that Stree had convinced to follow us around. Basically the party pet, and for some reason crossbow bolt magnet.\n\nA wonderful group of people, and very, very efficient at murder. We had been tracking a group of bandits that had kidnapped the 11 y/o son of the local baron, as well as the nominal leader of a nearby elf village. Working on a lead that the two survivors of our last encounter with the bandit gang had given us, we had worked our way to the bandits' base, deep in the forest. As we approached it, we started talking tactics.\n\n&gt;DM: You see the bandits' stronghold, lying between the ancient trees. It stands around 15 feet tall, with a flat roof. You can see one entrance, and a few windows, but the curtains are drawn. From inside you can hear the sounds of carousing. Outside the entrance are two guards, and on the right side is a ladder, pulled all the way up.\n\n&gt;Stree: Can we-\n\n&gt;DM: Absolutely not. For one thing, it's made of stone, and for another, did you forget about the hostages?\n\n&gt;Stree: Fine. Guess we'll have to do it the hard way.\n\nSo we did it the hard way. We made pretty good use of our surprise round, eliminating the two guards. But before we could celebrate, we heard something really odd: wheels. And lo and behold, two more guards appear on the roof overlooking the entrance, hauling, shit you not, a\n##fucking\n#ballista\n\nas an antipersonnel weapon. After some surprise from the party, and not a little bit of panic, Stree did the only sensible thing: shifted to bear form and charged up the wall to RIP AND TEAR. She swiftly disables the ballista by cutting the rope and then starts in on the crew. Fortunately, the already loaded bolt went wild, impacting the ground in front of Buddy harmlessly. The rest of the party, bar the wolf, worked their way up, with Ander and Asha both rolling 20s on their athletics checks to climb up. (Yes, I know there's no such thing as a crit on a skill check, but rolling a 20 on one is still pretty awesome.) After polishing them off, the party had the following conversation:\n\n&gt;Ander: Anyone have rope? We might be able to repair this thing and haul it down or something.\n\n&gt;Pretty much the whole party: *raises hands*\n\n&gt;Ander: Great. Give me a second here - hey Asha! Give me a hand with this, will you?\n\nSo the two soldiers did their best to restring the ballista. After some successful rolls, everyone was standing around admiring their handiwork.\n\n&gt;Ander: Looks like it'll fire. We should try to get it down.\n\n&gt;Orryn: Wait: We have more rope, right?\n\n&gt;Ander: Well, I've got some left - \n\n&gt;Viondra: I haven't used any of mine.\n\n&gt;Stree: Nor I mine. What do you have in mind?\n\n&gt;Orryn: ...we tie the ballista to Stree's bear form.\n\n&gt;DM: What. \n\nSeveral seconds of silence pass, before\n\n&gt;DM: You know what, fuck it. The ballista is kinda small anyway. \n\n&gt;All: *Cheering, laughing*\n\nSo that's exactly what we did. We tied the ballista to Stree as a bear, who helped get it down once it was secure. Asha then yanked the already-fired bolt out of the ground, leaving us with two bolts (there was one bolt that the crew hadn't loaded before the BEAR ATTACK). We then devised a cunning plan: Orryn, the gnome, would ride the bear as we breached the main entrance. Viondra would follow close behind and aim the ballista, and then Orryn from his position atop the bear would fire it. Asha would then step in to load bolt #2, Merrik would aim, and Ander would fire. So we kicked in the door and the surprise round started. The DM decided that since it was so fucking ridiculous, we had advantage for that round. But, as Orryn was preparing to fire the ballista, he remembered something.\n\n&gt;Orryn's Player: Sneak attack applies to all ranged weapons, right? And we have advantage?\n\n&gt;DM: ...you're shitting me. \n\nSo yes. Maybe it's not RAW, and I'm really not sure of how sneak attacks and siege weapons interact, but damned if that rogue didn't get the extra d6 on the damage from that ballista.\n\nNeedless to say, we mopped the floor with the poor bastards inside that room.",

        "text": "At the end of the first post, I left off at a point where my character acquired a dragon egg, thanks to the naive efforts of the cult of Cyric. I stuff that bag of holding in my backpack and played ignorant. \n\nThe story continues, where the rogue, and I, are separated from the others. The cultists in watch uniforms tell us that the others have been arrested, or escorted, to the castle. We assumed that something could be amiss. \n\nI thought that our involvement with Cyric might have leaked, or something else incriminating. Then, the cultists inform us of a hideout the dragon cultists have gathered to. So we had a choice, and I suggested springing out the others to take down the hideout together. We make a request of the cultists for supplies, using our writ of credit.\n\nAfter loading up, rogue and I take 10 cultists with us. All disguised as guards. We bullshit our way to our \"posts\" in the keep, making way to the dungeons. We kept the \"guards\" on watch by relieving the real ones for debriefing. We have limited time. In the dungeons, we do not find our companions, they must be elsewhere. We do find dragon cultists... Lots of them. And I smile for a moment.\n\nSince we supplanted the real guards,  no one could be alerted. And so I begin to ask questions, politely. No answer. I pop a half-orc with an eldritch blast. They get rowdy and angry. I used silent image, to produce dark tendrils reaching from the shadows. They got spooked, but they called my bluff. And before I could cast arms of hadar, the rogue gets someone to talk.\n\nThe rogue found the most skittish cultist, grabbed him, stabbed him, and treats the wound with an acid vial. (She called it \"perfume\", when questioned later. She actually has perfume) She's starting to really embrace the \"easier\" methods.\n\nHe talks, but doesn't know enough useful information. So, we offer an invitation to join. He turns it down, and I slay him, hoping someone will crack and consider the offer. Un/fortunately, the cyric cultists that were with us started to get blood thirsty, and began hacking at the prisoners through the bars. Seeing as they no longer had any use, we let it happen. The dungeons were purged of every prisoner (yes, even the vagrants). Eh, they were criminals, we saved the law the effort of trials. Plus, there is hardly any blood on my hands. We walk out and steal horses to ride to the next objective, before the real authority finds our mess.\n\nBefore we set out to the hideout, the cultists gave us 4 bone masks. (I plan to keep that mask as proof of \"slaying\" a horseman of cyric, incase suspicions fall on me again) On the ride to the hideout, the rogue and I donned our masks, and removed our guard disguises. After a 1 hour ride out from the city walls, we come to the place on fire, with a large skirmish taking place out front. It seems our companions have been busy letting loose on our enemies. (@note. Apparently, the authorities pulled them aside to weed out this hideout. They were not arrested or questioned.)\n\nUnder my suggestion, the rogue and I split our calvary forces and commenced a pincer attack. Riding in with a bone mask on, I shout out a few words to demoralize the dragon cultists: \"Your compatriots are dead. You are alone. Fear and despair, you worms!\" and I start trampling and shooting eldritch blasts.\n\nWhen the battle ended, our NG sorc wanted to non-lethal-tazer(shocking grasp) the only captured cultist, hoping for information. She accidentally knocked him out. She heals him and threatens to do it again if he doesn't talk. Granted, he's surrounded by us, and cyric cultists (who are now wearing skinned remains of his former friends and covered in blood, with wild elated expressions). He talks, and we learn of a new location.  The cyric guys slay him, and we plot our next course. (Btw, the ranger and sorc are starting to think we drank the cyric koolaid. I reassured the sorc, telepathically, that cyric is a convenient alliance. We will dispose of them when we are done. She hesitantly accepted this as good intentioned) \n\nI suggested we make camp a half hour walk from the smoldering fire, and have our \"friends\" retrieve some supplies for us. That way, should the authorities arrive (and they will) they won't find us immediately. I'm expecting something to happen over the dungeon incident.\n\nSince the cyric cultist were so pumped up from the slaughter and destruction, they went reveling in the streets of Waterdeep, that night. Which benefits me greatly, since the authorities will be weeding them out a bit. This will blow their carefully built cover and keep their numbers from becoming too great. None of the ones who know are brave enough to betray our identities.\n\nThe next morning, the representative of the Zhentarim faction, who was present during discussion at the keep of Waterdeep, shows up with our supplies. \"So. The four horsemen of Cyric, huh?\" I stated that I have no idea what those are, but I assured her that we are taking care of it. She states that the dungeons of Waterdeep are apparently empty now, and I said \"Good. You have a place to put those Cyric cultists, now\". She seems more amused at the the thought. Nevermind that she has our supplies, but I can appreciate that it's not the paladin with his sword drawn. We give thanks and move on.\n\nIn the thick fog of a mere, we find ourselves playing a game of hot and cold, with these runic stones that stave off evil. Granted, none of us are fiendish or undead, so we're fine to use them. After some time, we came to a bank and our choices were simple; left or right. \n\nThe party futzed around talking for a 10 minutes, then some small lights appear out over the water. I immediately take the left path, hoping to ignore such childish traps. But, the party was fixated on watching. The lights disappear, and then we get surprise-shocked.\n\nAfter a small bout with these things, I failed to keep the bag of holding (containing the egg) hidden because I got shocked from behind and spasmed. In response, i kept moving along the bank each turn, firing eldritch blasts, till i was out of sight from the fog. (I send a txt to the DM) Quickly, I packed flour (running joke that my character eats raw flour) and mud into the opening of the bag, and decided to dodge the next attack by rolling prone. The sorc caught up just in time to see me on my back, but destroying the wisp with a final double-beam. (my eldritch blast was double unnat-20's to hit, and double 6's for damage. eery)\n\nI was not confronted about the bag, because before anyone could say a word a shadow wizzed by. A sudden aura of fear struck. The ranger and rogue panic, but we got them to hold it together and pressed on for cover.\n\nIn little time, we find a cavern, large but empty. It was filled with debris and acid damaged corpses. We thoroughly examined for threats and then took a short rest. Unfortunately, before we could zip out, a humanoid figure 9ft tall and black as night walks in with a sadistic grin. When he spoke, a puff of acidic fog emanated. It's a black dragon.(DM handles dragons as having a secondary humanoid form) A very particularly infamous one. Voaraghamanthar, the Black Death.\n\nWe were not immediately evaporated because he had something else in mind. And the fear aura came from him. Struck down by terror, I was forced to listen, instead of escaping.\n\nHe wanted his worshippers back. Something the dragon cultists have taken. He wanted the knowledge of the location of the remaining rings of Myrkul (he has 2 of 5). He was aspiring to take Myrkul's place as a god of death. Everything he wanted stemmed from raiding the fortress we were heading to. I openly appreciated the sentiment that you never reveal your entire hand, because he wanted to be covert in his 'betrayal' to the cult. (Granted, his pride was his mistake. He told me too much, and appeared personally) The party accepts his 'quest', and is tasked to seek out his followers, marking us with a runic aspect of the black dragon. (the party doesn't want to die gruesomely)\n\nThen, the DM pulls me aside... I get a strong feeling invade my mind. Ever since the dragon started monologuing, I have been focusing inward. My patron wants this one dead. I can't leave this cave without those rings or his life intact. It was my best chance knowing he would rarely show his face, let alone drop his guard. \n\nI was stuck. I knew the beast would betray us, once we bring him what he wants. But, how do I do something that improbable? I could call a favor from Cyric, but that's in poor taste. No, I chose (offered from DM) to be a complete conduit of my patron. He will take care of it. I chose this option because I did not make a pact just to be half committed. (My character's ego is forfeit. This patron has taught him about the deceptions of gods, and their dependence on us. The gods are miserly, unsympathetic, and they hold us back from our true potential. Thus, he knows divine and nature spells without some petty devotion. A.k.a. pact of the tome)\n\nTo my companions, this is how the event occurred: Everyone was making their way out, and I stalled to write an entry in my book, which is typically necessary. Once I was alone with this dragon, my companions suddenly hear a very angry roar. They all failed the save for fear. The sorc attempts to use message \"What are you doing!? Get out of there!\" (ignoring line-of-sight apparently). The answer: horrors beyond her wildest imagination. And the words in my voice \"NOT NOW\". Needless to say, the sorc fell over sobbing in absolute terror.\n\nThen silence. We walked out with a wide smile, and a complete disregard for anything. They asked if everything is ok. We told them \"Yes. Come on. We got STUFF to do! :)\" They pressed again. We said \"He didn't seem to like our jokes. But we don't mind those simple things. Come on.\"\n\nAnd we did. We(I) suffered severe damage to our(my) sanity. We can only refer to ourself in the plural, now. We have complete disassociation and mania. But we kept the rings hidden, and we told them nothing. That dragon was going to betray us. We did the party a favor. \n\n-------------\n\nIf you haven't guessed, my patron straight up Scanners-exploded the dragon's mind. I don't get xp for it, but I don't care. This story is off-the-rails. The party is starting to get spooked. I think they regret missing the crazier side of my character. \n\nThe DM commented to me privately, afterwards. \"Ya know, for an evil campaign this is not that bad.\" I could only laugh and agree. The party is practically villains right now, and I'm leading them straight to hell.",

        "text": "Unlike many great stories on this subreddit, I'm ashamed to say that this is not exactly a tale of grandeur.  Neither is it the most witty of comedies nor the most intriguing of plights.  This tale is merely the story of a very dangerous, very stupid risk that somehow paid off based solely on a group's dedication to a joke.\n\nFor those of you who do not know how Town of Salem works, you may wish to visit the wiki or watch a good play of it or else some of this might not make much sense.  Similiarly, if you are not a fan of Harry Potter, there is a lot that might go right over your head.\n\n---\n\nI do not consider myself a very big Town of Salem player.  I go through phases here and there where I might play hours of it over the course of a weekend to going a whole month without even touching it.  As it happens, this story takes place when I was going through another ToS phase.  That particular night I'd been having the worst luck and every round saw me to the business end of a noose.  Before heading to bed I decided I would play one last game.  If my luck turned around, I'd at least be ending the night on a good note.  If not then what was there to lose?\n\nI chose a normal game and, as usual, got placed into a lobby of randomly picked strangers.  As it so happened, these random strangers, myself included, did at least have one thing in common : a love for Harry Potter.  From the moment it was time to pick names and the name 'Harry Potter' entered the chat, everyone was singing the same tune.  Next came Ron, then Draco, Hermione, and so on.  Trying to be quick, I chose Dumbledore, since that was the first thing that popped into my head.\n\nAlright then.  I won't lie.  I was actually kind of excited.  It isn't often that people jump on a theme and it's nearly unheard of to find nearly all 15 people sticking to it.  All that was left was to wait for my role.  Alas, the last role to wrap up my night.  What would job would the great headmaster undertake?\n\nExecutioner.\n\nDamn.\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar or new to Town of Salem, the executioner is a simple role with a simple goal : Get your target (randomly chosen) lynched by the town.  You're considered Neutral and gain the added benefit (although it can come off as suspicious to killing roles) of being immune to attack at night.  However, you can screw this up very easily by either making yourself very obvious, having people mistake you for the Godfather, who is also immune at night, people flat out discovering you are an executioner and lynch you on principle so they don't have to worry about you messing with people, or waiting too long and having your target killed at night which will turn you into a Jester (Someone who purposefully wants to get lynched).  In short, it is simultaneously super easy and yet very difficult.  One move can make or break you.  So, one might understand my lack of enthusiasm at seeing that grey title pop up on my screen.  And of all the characters I could have gotten to be my target, it could not have been one of the two people who did not choose Harry Potter names or someone who had named themselves after a Deatheater.  Nope.  As we entered the town my stomach sank as I looked to see who Dumbledore was going to try and kill.  Ronald Weasley.\n\nYep, I thought, of course.  Harry Potter's best friend.  In a town where we also had Fred and George, not to mention Ginny.  Oh yeah.  Somehow I had to convince an entire band of Harry Potter fans to kill Ronald Weasley in cold blood based solely on the suspicious word of an unreliable headmaster.  No pressure.\n\nThe first day was fine enough.  We pretty much spent the brief moments cracking Harry Potter jokes before it went into the night phase.  By the next day, Snape had been stabbed by a Serial Killer and the mafia's target had been healed by the Doctor.  In all honesty, when you play a neutral role, the plight of the town or the mafia sort of becomes little more than silly banter.  As such, I chose to play it safe.  I backed off and just let things play out, instead deciding to have fun with roleplaying the name a bit.  In my own experience, sometimes the best way of gaining people's trust, with the unfortunate tradeoff of possibly painting a target on your back, is to be charismatic.  So, I played the game.  I pretended to be the concerned headmaster that disapproves of his students killing each other, addressing everyone as though I truly were Dumbledore giving a speech to his students.\n\n\"And of course it had to be one of your Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers that was found dead.\"\n\nIf I didn't have them before, that gem got them laughing enough to garner some favor.\n\nA fruitless day ends with everyone at least enjoying the light roleplay while at night I debate my strategy as to how to kill the Weasley boy.  While I was playing my role, he was playing his rather well too.  He had been chatting a lot between the people playing Harry and Hermione and they seemed to be forming an alliance fast.  If I waited too long, Harry and Hermione could dissuade the rest of the town.  If I pounced too soon or too clumsily, they might turn on me.  Just as the music signaled that the night was ending, I made the decision to go with the latter.  \n\nThe rooster crowed and we all came out to discover the bodies of Fred Weasley, having apparently been killed by the mafia, and William Hobbs (one of the two who had decided to not go with the theme) who had been stabbed by a Serial Killer.  Quickly, I started to play a rather common, albeit sometimes effective gambit.\n\n\"Attention students!  Last night I witnessed Ronald Weasley sneaking into Mr. Hobbs' chambers.\"\n\nI hoped that slightly playing up the bit might make it more strong.  It backfired.  Almost immediately, the real Lookout piped up, proclaiming their role while the Investigator, Harry Potter, in a bitter twist of irony, spoke up, saying that he had investigated me last night.  With my behavior and his evidence, it became very clear that I was obviously a desperate executioner.  With no leads to the real killers (again), the town rounded on me and the votes started flying up.\n\nOne last shot.  The votes were quickly tallying.  Normally, I would try to play the liar's game, saying that Harry was a fraud of some sort and that I was the Random Town role, making for a second Lookout.  It was early enough.  The bell tolls and my character is making his way up to the podium.  I'm primed to type.  Yet, for whatever reason, my brain made the sudden change to a new tactic.  It was something I had toyed with before, but knew it would normally fall on deaf ears.  In a room like this, though, where we all had, just moments prior, been cracking jokes and really playing into our respective characters, it might just be stupid enough to work.\n\nNow, I don't like to brag usually.  I would like to believe myself to be a modest person most of the time.  But for the story's sake, I would like to make the important mention that during my keyboarding classes, my record has been about 62 words a minute.  This was the perfect time to really put that score to use.\n\nBefore my character even made it to the podium, I was typing like my life depended on it.  In this case, at least in terms of the game, it did.\n\n\"I will not deny it.  I am, indeed, an executioner.  Harry was correct in his judgement and, much as I would expect of him, has called me out for what I am in hopes to protect his dear friends.  But please, listen to me.  I do this not just for myself.\"\n\nEnter.  Not much time left for my defense.\n\n\"Consider it.  You need me.\"\n\nEnter.  Hopefully, I've gained their attention.\n\n\"You need me because I have a very precious power that any of you require.  One more strong than any curse or Elder Wand.  I am a guaranteed Guilty Vote.  So long as you stay loyal and trust in me, I shall never die.  No matter if you are a student, a teacher ... a death eater.  No matter who you put up on that podium, I will vote to have your enemies hung.  A jester?  What is it to me if I have what I require?  I will protect you.  I will keep you safe and be there for my students to the end.\"\n\nEnter.  By now the defenses just ended.  Nobody is even saying a word.\n\n\"All I require is the head of Ronald Weasley.  What do you say?\"\n\n20 seconds.  Just one last line to hook them.  Some have already cast their vote.  Ron is the only one talking now, scoffing at my efforts.  Shouting about how Harry would never let that happen.\n\n\"Who wants to join Dumbledore's Army?\"\n\nSuddenly the chat explodes with voting notifications.  Some just putting in their votes, others changing it.  As the last ten seconds tick away, I sink back in my chair.  Well, I tried.  Much like the rest of my night, I'll be hung, this time by a cast of some of my favorite characters no less.  The bell tolls once more.\n\nInnocent.  11 to 1.\n\nWait, what?!  I sit straight up and lean toward my screen as though I might have mistaken the green text for anything else.  And in the chat, everyone.  Every single person in the chat is voting up Ronald Weasley.  I couldn't even type.  I was just laughing.  Laughing at the absolutely idiocy and brilliance of the situation as Ronald pleaded for his life, trying to make a case.  He was the medium.  He could talk to the dead and find out who killed them.\n\n\"Come on!  Harry?!  Hermione?!  WTF?!?!\"\n\n10 to 0.  Guilty.  It was unanimous.  I was too busy laughing to even put in my own vote.  Just like that, the rope went taught around the Weasley's neck and so began the reign of Dumbledore's Army.\n\nTrue to my word, whenever someone made their way to the podium, I always pitched in my guilty vote.  It did not matter to me if they were good or evil.  I made a promise to 'protect my students' and I always voted guilty.  Throughout the whole round, somehow my word became law.  Knowing myself to be neutral, many people would whisper me their roles or even asked for advice.\n\nIn another stroke of brilliance, when it was revealed that Hermione had been the Jester and stood on the podium, I told her that I was sorry and, just for fun, mentioned that 'it was a shame since she had always possessed great potential as a witch'.  To which she replied in the most amazing way possible, saying that she wouldn't kill me because \"We're his army. Dumbledore's Army.  Everyone in this room's been fighting.  Everyone in here's proven they're loyal to Dumbledore.\" A direct quote from the books she apparently had also written in her will, posted in chat as her final words before she was hung.  True to her words, even though I was the only vote she did not kill me.\n\nAs such I lasted all the way to the end, eventually helping the town win the game.  I doubt that tactic would have ever worked in any other game, but man am I glad that it did.  After a horrible night of bad luck and bad plays, it was ended with perhaps on of the most memorable, albeit also one of the most dorky, rounds I'd ever been treated to.",

        "text": "Paragon Chat is, in essence, a chat room client that utilises assets from City of Heroes. The original CoH client, up to issue 24, is functional, but not as a game, of course. Actual gameplay has been removed to avoid being sued, but you're able to make a character and look around the game's maps while chatting to other users. As such, some folks who used to RP in CoH a fair bit have used it to continue to RP when they can.\n\nThe other day, while in Pocket D, a small girl enters the bar and strikes up a conversation with two heroes about the cult that she had managed to escape from. The California based 'Church of the Left Hand Path' appeared to be a satanic and violent organisation, and the girl informed us of at least one ex-solider turned enforcer and the group having an old tank in their possession.\n\nNearby, Dr. Automata listens with intrigue. This would be my main supervillain, an intellectual sort who praises logic above emotion, seeing things like symbolism and hope as weaknesses ripe for exploitation. As such, when the heroes decide to go and deal with this cult, he tags along claiming to find the situation intriguing and wishing to observe. His actual goal, however, is to use his psychological expertise to find the cult leader, crush him emotionally and leave having proven a point.\n\nThe situation seems to become somewhat more dire as the group arrive to find an entrance to an abandoned missile silo. Entering, they find the place relatively empty, bar one metahuman door guard, who would be the ex-soldier we were told about. One of the heroes bluffs the guard to let us in to speak to the leader in exchange for more children, magically inclined or otherwise, and we continue in while Automata scans the complex.\n\nWhile there no additional individuals in the nearby area, it turns out that the cult had managed to stockpile enough weapons to stage an invasion of a small nation. Automata finds a few remote accessible weapons, which if used would 'destroy the complex' (as told by the person running the event) and, with the guard getting fed up and attacking the heroes, decides to flip the situation in his favour.\n\nTurns out the weapons in question functioned on cold war era computers, so they weren't terribly hard to hack remotely. He informs the door guard that he now had access to the remote access weapons and would activate them to shut down this entire operation lest the heroes were given what they wanted.\n\nThe door guard stops fighting, explaining that the state of California would be gone should said weapons be activated as said 'remote access weapons' were a stockpile of thermonuclear warheads, enough to wipe the state of California off the map.\n\nExcellent.\n\nAs it stands, this particular RP plotline had been put on hold due to IRL shenanigans, but Automata now had the state of California hostage, even when that wasn't the intention of his trip there.",

        "text": "A story from a mate of mine, Constance, via Skype.\n\nSo, today in Fallout...\nMe and Cait were hanging out at a pier, just shooting the shit, doing companion conversation things.. Talking to me about her hard life and all that.\n\nWe heard yelling, screaming, and gunfire, so obviously, being the fucking idiots that we are, go and check it out... It's a Radscorpion raping some Raiders against a Pinball machine.\n\nThen this dog comes out of nowhere and latches onto Cait's arm, so I take out my machete.. (I carry one for reasons) and lop the dog's head off while she's flipping her shit about getting it off of her... The dog is dead and Cait is getting fixed up.\n\nMeanwhile, this Radscorpion angers this raider to a point where he's like fuck nah, I have a missile launcher, let's end this shit now.....They both died in a nuclear firestorm of complete atomic annihilation... There were two cars these Raiders were living next to.\n\nSo, we swoop in and take all their shit.. Because we're bad ass like that, reaping rewards we didn't work for.\n\nAll of a sudden.. Cait is like \"oi u eer dat sawmoon's awt dair rustlin my whiskey and shite\"\n\nSUPER MUTANTS, AHOY... IT'S A FUCKING AMBUSH.\n\nGod damn hounds descend upon us, so for the next minute or so, we've got fully automatic shotguns slinging lead into trees while this hounds dart around biting our nipples and shit...... Friendly fire don't mean shit to mutant overlords though, because he's slinging missiles (they're missing) but it's still insane.....\n\nMore Super Mutants decide to leave their base thing as we kill the last of the hounds and shower us with laser rifles because they have laser rifles now I guess, and frag grenades....\n\nSo, we hunker down and return fire, I pass Cait a .50 sniper rifle and I take mine out as well.. Accurate fire and a few plasma grenades from me and it's running across no man's land time with a Thompson and a Combat Shotgun..\n\nThen the Brotherhood of Steel shows up in a Vertibird and starts raining lead on the mutant base with their door gun, the pilot is circling about and looking for a landing zone... But hey, we can't communicate and I can't say, \"Bro, don't do it, bro.. They've got Missiles... BRO\" \n\n\n\n\n\nBut it's too late... All of the Super Mutants concentrate their fire on the Vertibird and it begins smoking during it's descent.. \n\nThe BoS Vertibird takes a missile to the belly along with about 50 bolts from assorted laser weapons and starts spinning out of control towards the mutant base... Low and behold, it crashes in a ungodly ball of flame and fury, consuming a pair of mutants (which isn't all that bad)\n\nI've got this look on my face like I've seen someone kill my dog in front of me... But LOOK, a Lancer Knight Brotherhood of Steel BAMF gets up from the wreck and starts firing at everything in sight, he sucks obvs and the super mutants suck too, but it's a hell of a sight, all the while me and Cait are fighting our way through the junkyard that this escapade is taking place... So, he's fighting in the back of the facility as me and Cait fight in the front, I've never seen so many Super Mutants in one place, it's actually pretty amazing how deaf I went at one point and I was in awe at the fact that I was seeking cover with Cait and moving like it was as close to my life as possible, I wasn't dying today..\n\nSkipping forward about 3 minutes of non-stop gunfire, we take down the overlord with the help of Lancer Knight Charlie (That's his name now), but oh no... There's a legendary super mutant that comes out of a warehouse, tosses a frag at me and Cait (who absolutely loses her shit and runs off for cover as I duck into a shipping container).... I hear one bolt leave the SM's laser rifle.. And I hear a pained yell from the Lancer Knight.. I hear it again, but no yell this time... This time, I see a headless Lancer Knight crumpling to the ground... \n\nSo, now I'm like NOOOOO CHARLIE WHY... .FUUUUUUUCK.\n\nSo, I run up and shut the door on the warehouse this Legendary SM came from, sending shotgun shells into his chest as he back inside, giving me a second to prime a cryo grenade and toss it inside, slamming the door and inserting a new drum magazine into my shotgun.\n\nGrenade goes off and I pull the bolt on my shotgun as Cait bursts through the door with her own weapon in full auto, we move in..... 30 seconds of fire, noise, and confusion... Laser bolts are glancing off my chest armor and my left shoulder, virtually blinding me as I spray with my shotgun, switching to my Thompson as it clicked empty... Cait takes a bad hit and falls down, clicking empty on her shotgun as well, drawing a .44 Revolver I gave her earlier, firing it as I slide over and drop a Stimpak into her neck, giving one to myself as good measure...... She stands up and we finish off the super mutant..... It's done... Finally.\n\nBut what of our BoS friends?\n\nWe make our way through the wreckage and bodies to the Vertibird wreck... There's Charlie, Weapon still in hand, head some 10-15m off downhill.. He died a hero after living through a furious wreck like this... \n\nI make my way to the other side, looking for the pilot and door gunner... I see the gunner, inside, left arm missing, body bloodied and crumpled up... I pull his body out of the wreck, lie him down and take his tags from his neck... I'll need to inform Elder Maxson of these losses at some point... I go back to Charlie and grab his holotags, as well.. Moving along to find the pilot...\n\nAnd there he is, less than 5m from his pilot's seat.. pinned under the Vertibird wreck... I RP'd hard and told myself he was still alive, so I had to do the unthinkable... I couldn't pull him from the wreck and Cait doesn't think too highly of the BoS to even want to help me, which leaves me to this...\n\nI pull my machete from its sheath and pull him as far as I can from the wreck... I hack at his left leg and his right... They come loose after some effort and I'm able to pull him away and prop him up against a tire pile a few meters away.\n\nHe doesn't make it. I take his ammo and tags, leaving his weapon in his lap, straightening his bomber jacket before moving onto the next body to move him beside his comrade.\n\nThey are at rest and I am beyond words at what happened... I move back into the warehouse and sleep for the next 12hrs..\n\nTLDR: Shit got real in Fallout 4\n",

        "text": "This is my first story on Gametales (so sorry if the link flair is messed up or something), but given that I'm very excited that this story has risen over a year or two of me playing 40k RPGs, I have to share it. This story is what me and on of my best friends and main tabletop partner jointly came up with that connects every character I've used in Warhammer 40k tabletop games such as Dark Heresy and Rogue Trader. It's fairly long.\n\n\nKadir was born on a dusty Imperial world with no surname to a nameless mother. Raised to perform droll monastic duties his entire life, he found interest in altered states of mind. As he grew, he experimented with the various drugs that his planet produced as commodities, and also trained with various weapons in order to fulfill ambitious goals of conquering galactic territory and performing genocide. While the troubled youth did still hold devotion to his Emperor, his priority did not lay with prayer or obsequiousness.\n\n\nHe secretly trained with what became his signature weapons; the flamethrower and other heat-based weaponry. His aim with these weapons was not to kill innocents or destroy races necessarily, though these may be by products of his true goal: to cause immense pain and grow loyalty to him from the weak. His proficiency with these weapons gave him a surname in his own eyes; Rubra Spatha, or The Red Spear. When he had reached young adulthood, he struck out on what had planned to be a short exploration mission on an abandoned mining planet with a few of his droogs - there, he found much more than he bargained for: Necrons.\n\n\nHis friends mercilessly slaughtered, Kadir was captured for an unknown reason. After an uncertain amount of time, as he had lost count of the days, he was *released* by the Cryptek on board the vessel. His stay at the Necron post was not without some lasting effects - firstly, his eye was taken from him and replaced with a rudimentary device that barely allowed for him to interpret what it saw, but it was better than being half blind. Secondly, he had managed to take with him a valuable artifact from his captors - a Tesseract that, unbeknownst to him, contained a C'tan Shard. His experience in the Necron vessel would forever be the source of blind rage upon any mention or sight of anything resembling Necron technology or people, a PTSD symptom that he all but enjoyed having, given his affinity for strong emotions.\n\n\nHis return to his homeworld on a stale space pod that was destroyed upon re-entry was met with his \"family\" at the monastery greeting him sourly and without sincerity. His stint in captivity led him to want to venture out into the galaxy to achieve what he had wanted for so long, so without much hesitation, he gathered enough supplies and stole a ship just capable of bringing him to the planet Charon, a planet locally renowned for its sizable market and spaceport. There, he joined up with a crew led by the Rogue Trader, Alek \"Lord\" Kalishkov.\n\n\nWith the crew, he adventured the galaxy with goals of conquering the local cartel dynasty - and after a mission given to them directly from the leader of this cartel involving the assassination of a Necron Harbinger of Despair which inadvertently led to an impending Necron - led genocide  the Kalishkov Dynasty was born with Kadir as the sole proprietor of the Holy Whorehouse, the most popular red light entertainment station in the region. Upon the birth of the Kalishkov Dynasty, the next rival appeared in the neighboring region - a generations-old pirate syndicate known as The White Spires. Kadir and the Kalishkov Dynasty effectively warred with this syndicate, eventually replacing the feckless leader, Darkblade, with a Kalishkov-approved one, Matilda the Iron Hand, granddaughter of the founder of the syndicate.\n\n\nIt was at this time where the Kalishkov Dynasty was at its height, and Kadir at the height of his wealth, that the Silent Chaos God Malice reached out to him. With his hands, he grabbed Kadir's mind and fooled him into believing that the Emperor had \"chosen\" him - when he looked at himself in the mirror, or at his own hands, he saw himself glowing with divine power; however, in reality, his body had begun a twisted transformation into a Greater Daemon of Malice. As his madness grew and grew, his already conflicting personality had begun separating farther and farther apart, his body following suit in the latter stages. Eventually, he became two.\n\n\nThe body that Kadir had before his transformation returned, only knowing of devotion and servitude to the Emperor - or, in reality, to Malice. This form of Kadir became a humanoid Daemon of Malice known as The Black Spear. Kadir's ambition and hedonism split off from his corporeal form and was reborn as another human; Kentz. Kentz was born at a random point in the timeline of the universe, and his natural life was filled with antics and crime that led him to founding a pirate syndicate of his own: The White Spires. Kentz, in his old age and as founder of the White Spires, was known as Kentz Whitebeard, or the White Spear, and he was succeeded in death by a weak and cowardly leader known as Darkblade.\n\n\nAt this time, it's important to describe the unreal plane of souls. While The Warp is what is commonly referred to as what holds all incorporeal beings, there is another entirely philosophical realm that was born when the first life forms became sapient. These life forms were the universe finally becoming able to look at and learn about itself, and when these sapient beings turned around to marvel at the universe they were born from, a plane was created in their minds that housed all their consciousnesses. It was in this plane that Kadir's \"soul\" split into two, and when it did so, it left a sliver of space in between them, and this was eventually filled just like all other empty spaces in the plane by a newly conceived sapient being - and it just happened to be Clagius Clanler.\n\n\nClagius was born to a poverty stricken family in the moldy alleys of a packed Imperial hive world. His mother died shortly after his birth, and his father gave up when he was a child, leading Clagius to be forced to learn his ways around the back alleys of his home, and through the maze of words necessary to get his way in the world. Being somewhat cowardly in the heat of conflict, but cool and suave in any social situation, Clagius was able to rise to some degree of infamy in the underworld of his home - that, and in the painful memories of many a mistress.\n\n\nClagius' life was filled with many adventures, but being the soul that filled the void between the Black Spear and Kentz Whitebeard, his fate was ill. After an adventure with a group of Inquisitors who required the help of a criminal in order to learn of a particular heist that had taken place of a high-profile mining operation, he was confronted by the leader of a cult of Malice-worshippers at a location known as Blackstone Tower. This cult leader was genocidally insane and had the goal of ripping the veil between the Warp and Reality. After a heated battle between he, his group, and this Malice-cult, Clagius was sent falling into the great Collider that was meant to tear the wall between realms apart. Upon his entry into this plane between the Warp and Reality, he collided with his consciousness in the unreal plane, causing his soul and the torn soul of Kadir to combine into one glowing consciousness, The Spear Soul, radiantly shining over its neighboring consciousnesses.\n\n\nThis is what the Necrons had planned for. Kadir's stealing of the Tesseract, his corruption by Malal, and the soul void filled by a random being who they would find and send pouring into unreality, all of it was orchestrated by Necrons, and when finally that radiant consciousness was formed, the Necrons plucked it from unreality, creating a deeper void than was ever seen before - and it was this void that was the birth of the prized Pariah Necron, Kadius, the Royal Spear, the first Pariah to be *made* rather than born, without the Blank powers of psyker-repellant, but with all the strength and weaponization of a powerful Pariah, and it's with Kadius de Regium Spatha that the Necrons will further whatever mysterious efforts they have planned ahead.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3yj8x1/dd_5e_the_tale_of_twenty_natural_twenties_or_why/",
        "text": "So I just wrapped up a session from my D&amp;D 5e campaign and yeah\n\nSo the party was investigating a noble district brothel because all their clues from a swarm of undead babies appearing in a local all-girls college to pregnant female parishioners falling ill at a church led there. They explore around for a bit and find a runestone under the establishment they think might be linked to the weird shit going on. When they attempt to leave the premises with he runestone, the first phase of a boss fight begins.\n\nIt begins with the halfling sorcerer rollig a NAT 1 on a Wisdom save vs being dominated by the boss (who was moonlighting as the brothel's receptionist). The boss lures the sorcerer, the barbarian and the paladin (for whom this was their first session) into a back room. The rogue and bard believe they're just signing to say they took the runestone away under suspicion of magical shenanigans and so are completely absent for the surprise round of combat.\n\nThe boss dominates the paladin, throws the sorcerer into the wall and narrowly misses the barbarian with a strike from it's tail. We enter initiative order.\n\nThe sorcerer and the boss both roll natural 20s on initiative. The boss wins a contested luck roll and gets to go first, hitting the barbarian in the chest. The sorcerer goes, twins and quickens his spells and throws out a bunch of attacks, two of which roll a NAT 20 to hit. He ends up doing 34 damage while only hitting with half his attacks. The bard and rogue jam up their turn trying to unlock the door. The barbarian rages and misses both his attacks. The paladin manages to shake the temporary domination and does an unarmed smite attack, dealing a grand total of 32 damage after the boss's vulnerability to radiant was taken into account.\n\nThe boss gets off a few more hits, whittling down the barbarian's health a little. The sorcerer, now out of all but one spell slot due to trying to fuck with the paladin earlier in the session, pulls out daggers and goes to town. Two. NATURAL. TWENTIES.\n\nSo he cuts the tail off the boss, doing another 30-odd damage in the process. The boss is looking significantly worse for wear now and then the barbarian gets a couple of good hits in, followed by the bard blowing down the door with a Thunderwave. When the boss hits 5% health its final ability activates. The rogue and bard both roll natural 1s to resist the domination effect and attack the barbarian and the paladin. The rogue gets a hit off, doing five damage to the barbarian, which is nothing when he's raging. The bard's player is busy trying to tie their hair up while simultaneously trying to pet my cat, so they tell the sorcerer's player to roll for them. Another natural 20 sees the bard springing past the paladin's platemail and ramming a rapier into their intestines for 18 damage.\n\nIn the confusion the boss attempts to flee. As it flees, disguised as the receptionist, the local guards attempt to stop the party to figure out what the hell is going on. The sorcerer asks if he can roll Acrobatics to dodge over and around the guards and give chase. He's a halfling and can move brought their space so I say sure.\n\nNatural. Fucking. Twenty.\n\nAt this point, the sorcerer's player has cycled through four different sets of dice. Each time nothing changed. He just can't stop rolling amazingly. The dice, as they say, were hot.\n\nSo a couple of the guards give chase to him. One of them turns out to be fucking Bruce Willis. A slew of 19s and 20s see this guard brush off illusions, negotiate heavy traffic and dodge thrown objects, all while accelerating faster and faster. The guard's luck eventually comes to an end and he loses the sorcerer in a back alley. \n\nThe barbarian and paladin are both giving chase at the same time, while the bard convinces he guards that they're chasing a dangerous criminal and the rogue's player gets into an argument with their parents over text that lasts the rest of the game.\n\nHaving lost the guard chasing him, the sorcerer continues to follow the fleeing boss. A well thrown (ie, natural 20) ice knife does enough damage to let the paladin catch up and burn the remaining four health off the boss, which crashes lifeless to the rooftops.\n\nAt this point the session is nearly over. I rule that the sorcerer's ridiculously over the top number of athletics and acrobatics checks have worn him down to the point where he gains a level of exhaustion. With the boss dealt with, the sorcerer drags himself back to he back wall of he brothel, as he left behind a key item he realised he needed for the quest. A 3'4\" halfling begins the slow climb up the 35 foot wall.\n\nOn his first Athletics check, which is taken at disadvantage due to his exhaustion, he rolls two natural 20s to climb the wall.\n\nHe makes it over, falls into the garden and makes a Persuasion roll on one of the brothel's clients, trying to convince him to carry him to where he needs to go. At disadvantage, he rolls a 19 and a 20. \n\nHe gains a second level of exhaustion because Jesus Christ how much energy can the tiny guy have left?\n\nIt turns out he has just enough left to make one final NAT 20 on a Stealth check to hide away on a carriage heading towards the party's home.\n\nI hand him a d12, and ask that he rolls that instead if a d30 for the last fifteen minutes of the session.\n\n\nWe have thoroughly tested his dice, and in the hands of anyone else they behave perfectly normally. On a variety of surfaces, thrown in a variety of ways they maintain average rolls.\n\nWe have decided that in future a neutral third party must buy all his dice (I know he's not cheating, he's just some weird-ass luck vortex XD)",

        "text": "So. There's four, fiveish idiots plotting a prison break on a highly secure dwarvish prison, guarded by very irate men with guns, and their mission is to rescue a tweeny revolutionary dumbass (Gavrilo Princip) from its stygian depths. Their usual approach of PUNCH THINGS was right out, because these guys had a fortified position and LOTS OF GUNS, so they had to figure a way to sneak their way in.\n\nThe drunkard wizard took a janitor job and the busty enchentress (guest player) took a waitress job. They spent days figuring out the layout, vulnerabilities, rooms of interest, and possible avenues of attack. All in all it was surprisingly well thought out.\n\nSo naturally they settled on the old smash-and-grab. They're goddamned adventurers, and the adventure isn't adventuring properly unless people die and something explodes!\n\nOkay, that's unfair. They chose a REALLY GOOD SPOT to blow shit up, and they engineered a big old distraction that would keep a massive chunk of the guards occupied while they did stuff. But, as is so often the case, they got distracted by the universal murderhobo vice: ALL-CONSUMING GREED. See, this wasn't just ANY dwarven fortress. It was a fortress from which the original inhabitants had been expelled at gunpoint by the military that was now running it. Oh, and said military wasn't about to let the dwarves run off with all their shinies, so the main treasure room was still full of gleaming, glittering gemstones, gold piles higher than certain russian midgets, and a sapphire the size of a battle tank.\n\nWhich the party stumbled upon not two minutes into their break-in, after brutually murdering the guards.\n\nEvery single party member immediately dove headfirst into the pile, a la Scrooge McDuck, and tried their best to fill their bags before the guards showed up. And show up they buggering well did, armed for bear (and Dire Bear) and screaming for the drunk-ass wizard to get out of the pile. His response?\n\n&gt; *\"I AM THE PILE!\"*\n\nAnd that's how the wizard inherited many of the qualities of swiss cheese: Outwardly yellow, goes well with fine wines and booze, rather nutty, and filled with an alarming amount of holes. But I'm fairly sure cheese doesn't leave blood splattered all over the floor, walls, and ceiling. Thankfully, the REST of the party was there to bail his ass out, and they made short work of the thoroughly distracted guards.\n\nWith that, the party hotly debated whether to risk more guards and retrieve more loot, or cut their losses and bail. And seeing as how they now had to transport their wizard in a bucket, and more to the point, they didn't have another one around to soak up all the bullet wounds, they decided to leave while they were still possessing most of their limbs. A brief search later, they found the man they were sent to rescue, and hauled some serious ass out the big old hole in the ceiling that they had blasted earlier. Sure, some people got a little more shot than was entirely comfortable, and that friggin' wizard would never walk the same again, but their mission was now complete! Right? The guy's out of jail. So what if he's the target of an international manhunt, hundreds of miles from home, in enemy territory during the largest war of several decades, cut off from his contacts and any assistance, with no means of transit?\n\nWell, while they dealt with that, the wizard got used to his new life as a cripple and the party put aside lingering questions of why a hostile military force would leave a treasure hoard sitting right in the middle of a room with somewhat lax security. Because that totally wouldn't become a plot point that whipped around and bit them in the ass later.",

As with any town, you had your Lookouts, and your Doctors, and your... Werewolves... Ahem. In this town lived three invaluable individuals trying to stop the recent rise in deaths there. There was James Bae ( u/come2syria4training ), the BodyGuard: A silent protector for the innocent townsfolk. Gandalf (me), the Doctor: A good healer, nursing injured people back to health. And Fox Mulder,  the Investigator: A mysterious stranger trying to uncover the town's darkest secrets. In the days to come, these three characters will play a major role in overcoming the dangerous criminals lurking in this seemingly peaceful town; So prepare yourself for a tale of epic proportions, featuring ACTION! MURDER! BETRAYAL! ROMANCE! Okay, not romance, but all the other stuff! So let us begin with the first night.\n\nIt was a dark, quiet night in the town of Salem. Not a creature was stirring, not even a whale(m). The BodyGuard, James Bae, stood tall before the meek old Doctor. His eyes darted from the bushes, to the other houses, and from the other houses, to the non-stirring whales. The Doctor handed him a small vial filled with a dark blue, translucent liquid.\n\n\"Here,\" he said calmly, \"In case you get hurt.\"\n\nThe BodyGuard nodded silently and accepted the medicine, slipping it into his pocket for easy access.\n\nA silhouette flashed before his eyes. He blinked and looked again, but it was gone. Suddenly, the cock crowed. It was the first morning of a long, twisted week... And they were alive.\n\nThe BodyGuard assumed a position in the town centre as everybody else gathered around the well. The Investigator, with his shady coat and furrowed brow. The completely inconspicuous fellow, with his bloody knife and his crooked smile. And the Medium, with his... Wait. Where _was_ the Medium? It wasn't like him to be late.\n\n\nAll of a sudden, one of the townsfolk cleared his throat and began to speak.\n\n\n“I’m afraid last night, the local Medium was discovered dead in his home. He appeared to have been killed by a member of the Mafia. We could not find a last will. We found a death note next to his body. It read: ‘Just trying to make your job easier.’”\n\n\nGasps emanated from all the people. Each man, woman and child was now in danger of being killed, and it was up to our three unlikely heroes to stop it.\n\n\nIn the confusion, the Investigator slipped a note to the Doctor. The note said the following: ‘As the wisest of us all, you should speak for all of us. I am the Investigator. Last night, I was spying on the man in house number 5, and I saw him leave his house and enter the Medium’s. Announce your suspicions of him publicly. Do not involve me.’\n\n\nThe Doctor hobbled a few steps forwards and propped himself up on his walking cane.\n\n\n“I have reason to believe that the man from house number five killed the Medium. I propose that we hang this man, in order to save this town from its doom.”\n\n\nHe stepped back to his former position, as the crowd began to chant.\n\n\n“Lynch him! Lynch him,” they cried, in a rash attempt at saving themselves. The man from house number five was pushed into the centre of the town, and made his way to the gallows.\n\n\n“Mister Five,” spoke the Mayor, softly, “You have been accused of treason against this town. What is your defense?”\n\n\n...Silence. He didn’t know what to say. How could a guilty man plead innocence?\n\n\n“Mister Five, you have been found…”\n\n\nSilence befell the people as they ask realised the gravity of the situation. Could this man have been innocent after all?\n\n\n“...Guilty. Do you have any last words?”\n\n\nThe crowd gazed upon him, their eyes clawing at his mind, the noose falling softly around his throat. He took a deep breath, and said three words.\n\n\n“For the Godfather.”\n\n\nThe floor seemed to disappear beneath his feet. He closed his eyes, and let the last breath escape from his body. Everyone gloomily wandered back into their houses, feeling just that little bit safer.\n\n\nBut James Bae knew better.\n\n\nAs night fell, James Bae walked begrudgingly towards the house of Fox Mulder, to guard him for the night. He was about to knock in the plain, wooden door when it was opened by a shrewd man in a long, black coat. He motioned for the brutish BodyGuard to step inside, and James obliged. He patrolled the small interior, while the owner intently watched. They stared each other down for a moment. What secrets lie behind those lenses, black as the night itself, James Bae asked himself.\n\n\nFox broke the silence. “I’d like to make a proposition. You continue to protect me. When you do, I will provide you will information. The same goes for your friend, the Doctor. I will trade my intel for a guarantee of safety. I want nothing more than to rid this town of anybody intent on damaging it, as I'm sure you do too. I have proven where my loyalties lie already, for it was I who gave the Doctor that information earlier today. Without me, this town would be one Mafioso stronger. Obviously I can trust you, which is why you are the first and only person who will receive this offer. Should you accept, which you will, I implore you to relay this to the Doctor, so that he understands the plan the same as you and I.”\n\n\nThe BodyGuard continued to stare at Fox.\n\n\n“Alright,” he grunted, “sounds good to me.”\n\n\n“Wonderful. That’ll be all, then.” The Investigator smiled and coolly strode towards the tough BodyGuard. “Dismissed.”\n\n\nJames felt as though he shouldn’t leave so suddenly, but he knew to always follow orders. He trudged outside, and made his way back to his house. Maybe he could get some sleep before the morning.\n\n\nScreaming woke the BodyGuard from his slumber. He stormed through his front door to see the townsfolk crowded around something on the ground. The Doctor was on one knee, looking down. The Investigator was stealthily observing the crowd from a short distance.\n\n\n“What happened, what’s going on?!” James exclaimed, causing the Doctor to look up from whatever he was studying so intently.\n\n\n“Don’t come any closer, James.” Gandalf exclaimed loudly. “You don’t want to see this. He’s been mauled… by a werewolf.”\n\n\nJames crouched down and lifted his jaw up off the ground.\n\n\n“A werewolf?!” He yelled.\n\n\n“Yes. A werewolf.” Muttered the Investigator, who was now standing next to James.\n\n\n“Hey!” James spluttered in shock. “But you were over there!” He pointed to where Fox had previously been.\n\n\n“I am aware. Pay more attention to your surroundings, BodyGuard. It could save your life someday.”\n\n\nJames was about to retort, when the Doctor abruptly stood up.\n\n\n“There’s nothing we can do but find the monster that did this.” He said, shuffling to Fox and James to confer with them. The townspeople moved to their usual positions.\n\n\n“Alright, Doc. You have a hunch that the woman in house number eleven is the Werewolf. You didn't hear this from me.” The Investigator swiftly threw his hands into his pockets, and pulled out a piece of paper.\n\n\n“Read this on the seventh night of this week.” He whispered, as he wandered towards his spot. The Doctor and the BodyGuard followed suit.\n\n\nOver the next few days, those three eliminated almost all of the town’s enemies. The Werewolf was lynched on day three.  The Serial Killer was shot by a Vigilante on night four, and over the following day and night, three members of the Mafia lost their lives. It was the morning of the sixth day, and the team were clueless. Among the five living people, one member of the Mafia remained. James, Gandalf and Fox knew only that they could trust each other. As they left their houses to gather, Fox gave Gandalf a small note. It read: ‘I think the man in house number seven is the final member of the Mafia.’ Something about the note struck Gandalf as odd, but he couldn't quite figure out what it was. As the day progressed, the man from house number seven was brought to the gallows. As he stood there, he pleaded innocence relentlessly. However, Gandalf and James had no reason not to trust Fox Mulder. He had never been wrong before; He wouldn't lynch someone randomly.\n\n\nRight?\n\n\nAs the thoughts raced through the Doctor's mind, he realised that it was too late. He had been too absorbed in his thinking. The body of an innocent swayed in the wind before him.\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\nThe next day, the Doctor woke up with a heavy heart. What was going on? Why was an innocent man lynched? Who was the final enemy? As he opened the door, he felt his heart sink. Before him stood just two people, and neither of them were the BodyGuard. He spent the day mourning the loss of a good friend.\n\n\nThat night, the Doctor was about to fall asleep when he remembered the note from a few days ago. He stood up and wandered into his dusty old study, sat down, and read the note.\n\n\n‘Took you a while to connect the dots, huh…?’\n\n\nSuddenly, the Doctor felt a sharp pain in his back. He slumped into his chair, barely holding on to his life.\n\n\n“Fox… Why?” He muttered.\n\n\nHe didn’t get an answer.",

        "author": "CorvidaeSF",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3yc2nc/vampire_the_masquerade_when_the_going_gets_tough/",
        "text": "(Unlike previous posts of mine, this little tale from [our ongoing Vampire campaign](https://sfvampires.wordpress.com) requires a bit more summarizing so sadly, no audio clip this time)\n\nOur GM has always maintained that the thing that gets people killed in Vampire most often isn't the backstabbing politics, or the unholy death-monsters, or the inevitable explosions. No, the thing that is most deadly for Vampire players is not managing their ~~day-to-day~~ night-to-night vampire shit. Players don't mind their bloodpool so end up getting taken out by wounds they should have been able to healed, or they don't mind their bloodpool and end up frenzying on someone they shouldn't have, or they don't mind their bloodpool and--in desperation to feed--make a bunch of mistakes while hunting that lead to Masquerade-violating shenanigans.\n\nThe moral of the story is: mind your bloodpool.\n\nSometimes, though, if conditions are just right, you can do everything possible to mind your shit and keep yourself in the black, but *another* player reaches a singularity of such fucktitude that it pulls everything around it in. And by \"just right,\" I mean just right for your asshole of a GM.\n\nThe following event took place in the middle of a major plot beat in our campaign, wherein three of our players were sent upstate (from San Francisco to Humboldt County) to meet with a cell of known neonazi-cultist-terrorists and convince them to make a doomed kamikaze raid on Sacramento in order to take the fall for a lot of the Masquerade-violating shit that's been going on (which may or may not have been our fault in the first place). Anyway, we got up there and once we waded through their creepy culty shit, we discovered that they somehow were *also* in possession of an Abomination, which is basically a werewolf-vampire hybrid, vanishingly rare, and about as fucking dangerous as you can imagine. \n\nSo we watched in horror as the group loaded up to drive to Sacramento--just as we asked--with a monster that could basically level half the town in a single evening--which we definitely did *not* ask for. What followed was almost literally a scene out of Mad Max where we took over the convoy and crashed the semi-truck carrying the Abomination in the forest halfway through the mountains, allowing it to escape \"harmlessly\" into the woods.\n\nTo explain how this happened, I need to pause a moment to mention the players in this scene. First and foremost was Augustus von Rabenholz (played by Chris), a distinguished German Ventrue with a voice like Count Dooku and the leadership skills to match. Next was Scout (played by myself), a quiet and mysterious Caitiff whom not much is known about. Last and not least, though, was Captain Thomas Anstis (played by Jim), a pirate Gangrel based on an actual pirate actually from the Golden Age of Piracy and whose Gangrel shape-change forms are a macaw-parrot (because obviously) and a giant-fucking-octopus (because OBVIOUSLY).\n\nIn a nutshell, Rabenholz tried to stop the convoy by talking his way through things, Scout hid on the truck waiting for the opportunity to stab a bitch, but Anstis took a more direct route by taking over the cab of the semi-truck, turning into giant-fucking-octopus in the middle of it, running the thing off the road, and then flying off as a parrot before it crashed into the woods.\n\nEveryone survived, astonishingly enough, but as you can imagine, Anstis ended up using a lot more blood for his little trick than we other two. Thus, he flew off as a parrot to a nearby town to grab some blood before sunrise. \n\nSince Anstis is short on time and there's not many people about, he decides on the charmingly direct method of breaking into a farmhouse. Midway through this, a sheriff's deputy rolls up and draws a gun on the intruder. Anstis tries to Dominate him into standing down, but gets his ass tazed instead. Anstis fights back, eventually biting the man into submission, then steals his wallet and leaves him unconscious on the lawn while he continues trying to break into the house.\n\nThe moment Anstis gets through the door, he’s instantly confronted by a man with a shotgun. The man fires, knocking Anstis back out of the house onto the lawn. He lays there a moment, playing dead until the man comes out of the house and approaches him. Then--because Anstis also has Thaumaturgy for reasons of don't ask--Anstis sits up and hurls a handful of flame into the house. Fire races through the building, the man yells and shoots at him some more, and Anstis ducks behind the house just before even *more* police cruisers show up, along with a posse of armed men. They spread out into the surrounding woods looking for him. Anstis sneaks after them, slowly stalking one who’s become separated from the others. Anstis kills him with a silent slash across the throat, drains him dry, then slashes the body more to make it look like an animal attack. With that, Anstis turns back into a parrot and flies away, finding a quiet place deep in the forest to sink into the ground for the day.\n\nThe next person to arrive in town is Rabenholz, via levitating himself there (because apparently everyone in this game has Thaumaturgy, urg don't ask). He doesn't need food but he needs shelter for the day, so he finds a random man up early–an old farmer named Leonard–and talks him into inviting him home, then finds a place to sleep in his shed. He casts a ritual to protect the structure from sunlight, but, just in case, he also Dominates Leonard into making sure no one disturbs the shed during the day.\n\nScout, meanwhile, reaching the town on foot not long after, finds a barn loft to hole up in. She doesn’t have the same ritual to protect her from errant light like Rabenholz has, but she does find a thick tarp to wrap herself up in. With just minutes to dawn, it will have to do, and she passes out into the deathlike \"sleep\" of the undead.\n\nAnd from there, just a few minutes before we closed our game session for the evening, the following discussion occurred: \n\nGM/Jason: “I have a question at this juncture. What’s the largest city in Humboldt County?”\n\nMe: “Uh, well the county seat is Eureka--”\n\nGM/Jason: “Yeah that’ll do. Okay, so everyone spend a blood. It’s now the next night. Anstis, you wake up in the middle of the woods, where you were before. Everything is just fine.” *turns to Chris and I* “You two do not. You wake up…in bags.”\n\nChris and me: “…Huh.”\n\nGM/Jason: “Let me explain what happened during the day. See, the state police descended upon this little town after several people were found to have been murdered in it. One guy–a sheriff’s deputy, in fact–seems to have died of a heart attack on the front lawn of a house that someone tried to break into. There was an arson attempt at that same house, followed by gunfire and a manhunt. But all that failed somehow to find the murderer, who dragged some motherfucker out into the woods, exsanguinated him, and left his body to be torn apart by animals. Clearly what’s going on here is some kind of crazy evil ritual cult thing, probably with nasty sex.”\n\nChris and me: *silence*\n\nGM/Jason: “So the next day, the state police blanketed this town and what did they find? Well, some guy’s barn had been broken into, and what should they find inside but a *dead woman*, wrapped in a tarp, with no visible cause of death!”\n\nMe: “…Maybe drugs?”\n\nGM/Jason: “Or kinky sex cult, I told you so! Anyway, the police also find an old man named Leonard telling anyone who will listen to *not* go in his shed. Well, what do you think they do but go into the shed and find *another* dead body! This one some weird cloaked hippy motherfucker–carrying a *sword*, no less–and *also* dead of a drug overdose! They took Rabenholz, put him in a body bag next to the woman, and arrested Leonard for participation in an evil sex cult.” *points at Chris and me* “You two are now in the Eureka General Hospital morgue.”\n\nJim: *laughing at our faces* “Chaos has descended upon a peaceful town!”\n\nGM/Jason: “Chaos totally has descended, and you know what the best part is? Nobody else even knows about this because the news is only reporting the shit that went down yesterday in Sacramento. So nobody knows where the fuck you are!”\n\nJim: “And they probably have been separated from their phones….”\n\nGM/Jason: “Yes! All of your belongings have been itemized and stored fuck knows where. You wake up naked in body bags–”\n\nChris: “…Great.”\n\nGM/Jason: “–With formaldehyde injected into you–”\n\nMe: “Aww, son of a *bitch!*”\n\nGM/Jason: “–And Eureka is a big enough town that there may or may not be some kindred in it, but even if there are, you sure as fuck don’t know who they are, you don’t know who their ghouls might be, and you have no contacts within the hospital. This ain’t something where someone is going to show up and wake your asses up. You’re locked in body bags in a morgue you don’t know. See you all next week.”\n\n\n(A detailed account of this--and other--sessions [can be found on our blog](https://sfvampires.wordpress.com/2015/12/24/10115/))\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Hi again all. This session takes place in the same campaign that https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3y1jhe/shadowrun_how_to_kill_a_van_with_a_sword_or_why/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3xwmqc/shadowrun_how_to_bake_a_fingerpie_or_why/. This was set after the Professor Sweedy Swissman incident but before the art of finger-pie baking was touched upon. While the previous posts may have focused on our esteemed murder bunnies Twitch and Kit-Kat, this session was all about the man with the plan: Sargan.\n\nA quick recap of our party: Twitch - A psychotic elven street samurai with a taste for swords, violence and a fine appreciation for plugging her body full of genetically enhanced material. Has thus far slaughtered a drug cartel hit-crew, a team of wet-work operatives and an armor-plated truck armed with a very big gun. \n\nKit-Kat - Our lovable infiltrator with a mild fixation for mindless violence that only rarely gets in the way of her work. As agile as one might expect of an elf but with the same social charm as a flatulent skunk who has just consumed their tenth cup of pure java. Very protective of her vehicles, her equipment, her pay-check and her team...in that order.\n\nKitten -  Raised by a tribal gathering of mystical warriors who worshiped the great cat spirits, Kitten was about as intelligent as your average corpse while wielding the power to kill everyone in a two block radius. Quick and quiet, Kitten could typically be discovered either sleeping the day away or scratching his arse with a look of confusion on his face. \n\nSargan - The man of the hour, our de facto leader and the only member of this motley crew that could be bothered to develop something resembling a plan. His official roles were as our social manipulator and long-range over-watch but the elf was often tasked with providing backup for Kit-Kat on stealth operations. As previously mentioned, Sargan's player had the worst case of luck. His character had a truly stupid number of dice for activities and he would constantly roll a glitch or worse. This will be very important for today's story.\n\nIt has been several weeks since the team engaged in the mission that led them to houses of horror, gullible scientists and road warriors. Several weeks where personal projects were completed, bioware was installed and Kitten continued trying to construct the world's greatest hammock. The once bountiful reserves of nuyen had started to dry up, leaving the team with no option but to once more offer up their services as expendable assets. \n\nThankfully, Sargan's fixer had something appropriate for the crew. A protection assignment for a small facility, isolated from the rest of civilization and very much preferring it that way. We wouldn't have anymore details than that until we met up with our Mr Johnson except for the fact that it would pay a grand total of 80,000 nuyen. With that much dough on the line, there was only one real option for the team. So the journey began, riches and glory at the forefront of our minds!\n\nTwo days in a cramped van later, violence was on our goddamn minds. With our Johnson demanding that we turn up within three days, there was no time to waste on luxuries like motels. It turns out that none of the eclectic runners were particularly suited to being locked up with three other people for long periods of time and no way out. Even the Matrix failed to distract since Kitten had no idea how to use it, Kit-Kat preferred pranking her team-mates and Twitch needed to satisfy an itch...of the murderous kind. Sargan, making an executive decision, pulled the van over at a small town and demanded the team piss off while he refueled. \n\nThe short version of those escapades? Twitch stole a car from some local gangers and then slaughtered them for trying to reclaim the vehicle. She then enlisted the narcoleptic Kitten to dispose of the evidence, the two of them spraying the car's interior with sports drinks to cover up their finger-prints before ripping it to pieces with a mono-filament chainsaw. Kit-Kat spent the time chatting with the only mechanic in town before trying to locate her now-absent mono-filament chainsaw. With some time away from the Three Shadow Stooges, Sargan started researching the meeting place for their contact and found out some very interesting information.\n\nLocated nearby our rendezvous was a single research facility, owned by the local single-A corporation known as Spitwater. The Shadowrun equivalent of a real company, Spitwater was considered something of the local under-dog. With investments in mining, environmental conservation, medical technology and minor defense contracts, Spitwater managed to compete with the Mega-corporations in Australia. The reward that had been offered made much more sense if Spitwater was going to be the employer. Research having been completed, Sargan went about the tedious task of gathering his bickering fellows and getting a move on. \n\nWhen the team finally arrived at the meeting place, a charming little valley with forested sections throughout, they were met by Mr Johnson. A gruff older man with a full beard and a near pathological disdain for shadowrunners, the Johnson immediately outlined the task he had for us: An armored convoy would be arriving at the facility within the next two days and Mr Johnson wanted us to ensure that it arrived intact. It seemed like the kind of task that Spitwater's security forces could handle easily until Mr Johnson dropped this bomb-shell on us: Two other runner teams had already been hired to waylay the convoy. \n\nThis was the reason for such a large reward. We would be going against between six and sixteen other runners, all of them unknown quantities. This should have been enough for the traditional shadowrunner self-preservation protocol to activate but this was hardly your typical group. Sargan, taking it all in his stride, calmly informed the Johnson that they would be taking the job and that Spitwater would increase the reward to 120,000 nuyen. Our contact was furious, seething and spitting in a manner most unprofessional.\n\nSargan kindly informed him that paying the new amount would ensure not only their skills but their loyalty as well. This sort of task was not one to be taken lightly and the fact that Spitwater was even considering the underground option indicated that there was a leak inside their own organization. If this shipment was as important as the Johnson seemed to suggest then he would require a team willing to lay down their lives for it. Sargan meant absolutely none of it but his performance was convincing enough for the Mr Johnson. A deal was struck, information exchanged and preparations were made. \n\nSargan was to use his background as a sniper to determine any potential marksman's nests while Kit-Kat and Twitch would begin to trap likely staging zones in the nearby forest. Kitten started the arduous process of summoning and binding an animal spirit, specifically a mighty jaguar spirit. The bestial entity was displeased about being caged in any form but after a lengthy battle, it conceded defeat. Our team assembled once more at midnight, filling each other in on what had been done to prepare. Outnumbered and easily outgunned, it was going to be a difficult engagement by any definition. The only advantage that they possessed, Sargan reasoned, was the shipping manifest: We knew when the convoy would be arriving.\n\nCompared to a possibly corrupt security force at their back and an unknown number of runners out to remove us from the equation, it wasn't all that much of an advantage. Still, we would have to make do with what we had. The convoy was entering the valley tomorrow evening. We only would have a small time frame to eliminate any targets trying to intercept or destroy the shipment. Our team would set up in one of the personnel quarters for the night and head out first thing in the morning. That was what we told our friendly representative from Spitwater but we thought it better to err on the side of caution. Slipping away from the facility under a series of invisibility spells from Kitten, the team began taking up their positions across the valley. \n\nTwitch and Kit-Kat separated, slinking through opposite sides of the forest. Kitten sat in a meditative trance inside a small grotto, hidden away while his spirit roamed the astral fields in pursuit of prey. Sargan opted to take the second most effective snipers position, reasoning that another sniper would automatically place themselves in the key location and Sargan would have a bead on them. His theory proved correct when, less than half an hour into their vigil, a soft crack echoed across the valley. There was a decidedly smug tone to Sargan's voice over the comm-link as he reported target down.\n\nThe night continued to drag on, the crickets chirping almost deafeningly loudly as the valley was illuminated by moon-light. Nothing had happened for at least four hours and the entire team was operating off of stimulants by this point. After the loss of their sharpshooter, the other runners seemed to have grown more cautious. With each minute that passed, we had to consider that a change in tactics might be necessary. As luck would have it, it was at this exact moment that Sargan spotted a low-flying drone zipping through the forest towards Twitch. Kit-Kat recognized the machine as a short-range reconnaissance drone from Sargan's description and deduced that it's operator must be nearby. \n\nIt was Sargan who located the rigger den, the hidden lair only just visible through his thermographic scope. With no clear shot available to him, the sniper suggested that he and Twitch put their infiltration skills to use. Twitch agreed to this new stratagem, pleased to finally commit violence against something. The deadly duo reconvened at the base of a slight hill. Plastered with foliage and hidden by the natural shape of the valley, this was the perfect location to cover any movement in the area. The group were kicking themselves for not having found it earlier but decided to rectify their previous error by slaughtering whoever was inside. \n\nA cursory scan of the area showed a very nasty Doberman drone armed with a light machine gun, parked on the ridge for security. Nothing too difficult for the pair of agile elves and so, they began to make their climb up the ridge. Sargan's player had been rolling amazingly well all night, from negotiating with the Johnson to effortlessly performing counter-sniper operations, so he had gotten more than a little cocky. This was an infiltration test, something that he excelled at, and not a very difficult one at that. As Twitch seamlessly transitioned murder-hobo to stealth operative, Sargan paid the price for his arrogance. Out of game, we joked about the sharpshooter having brought his own sticks to step on at the dramatically appropriate moment. In game, that might as well have been what happened. The sound of nature ceased at the exact right time for a thunderous crack to ring out as Sargan plowed straight through a pile of dry sticks. \n\nThe Doberman reacted instantly, unleashing a torrent of destruction towards the sound. Sargan was thrown off of his feet by the force of the impact, high velocity rounds ripping through his camouflage suit like wet tissue paper. Barely grasping on to consciousness, Sargan huddled behind a tree and waited to die. What he heard was a series of panicked shouts and screams of pain as Twitch appeared inside the alcove. Soon, there was nothing left of the rigger and his hacker companion but a gory pile. She was quick to rush to his side, the Doberman neutralized, and began hauling the wounded soldier vaguely in the direction of help. Having the Incompetent (Navigation) Negative quality made this somewhat difficult. \n\nAt the same time, Kit-Kat was garroting the infiltrator who had tried sneaking up on her. Alright, so maybe he had managed to surprise her, just a little bit. With a knife lodged between her ribs, the elf took great pleasure in ending her assailant. As her opponent breathed his last, Kit-Kat realized that team communications had been jammed. Knowing that Sargan and Twitch were together, she made a bee-line for the helpless form of Kitten. She arrived just in time to prevent him from suffering a terminal case of copper poisoning from a burly dwarf gunner. The fight would have been longer and more difficult had Kitten not emerged from his trance, incinerated the gunner and then been bombarded with an astral assault by another mage. Barely clinging to life by this point, Kitten commanded the semi-tamed Jaguar spirit to hunt the one who had harmed him as well as his fellows. \n\nTwitch and Sargan, half-conscious as he was, came to the conclusion that someone must have rigged the obvious paths for the convoy with explosives. With the sharpshooter in no fit condition to move, Twitch took off at a sprint to get there in time. She was half-way there when someone began blasting away at her with an assault rifle, spraying rounds everywhere. Another crack echoed across the valley and the gunman collapsed with a smoking hole in his head. Even with one foot in the grave, Sargan was as good as they come with a rifle. Hurtling across the valley like an Olypmic sprinter, Twitch gave no thought to any threats preventing her from reaching her goal. After all, Sargan had her back. \n\nIt was as she neared the path that the vehicles would take that Twitch noticed a van roaring around haphazardly. The passengers were desperately focusing fire on the colossal jaguar that was bounding after them while the driver did their very best to close the distance with Twitch. Keen-eyed as she was, the street samurai managed to spot a slight bump in the road. With no time to think, she ran flat out towards it. The van was closing in, it's driver intent on turning Twitch into a smear on the road, with the Jaguar finally turning to smoke under the barrage. \n\nTwitch slid across the ground on her knees, tearing the item free from it's earthy mound and flinging it into the sky. The proximity mine flew high into the air before exploding, painting the early morning horizon orange far before the sun considered rising. Her mission completed, and her legs turned to jelly, Twitch sighed irritably to herself as the van closed with her. There were a pair of faraway pops and the van veered violently off the road. As it passed inches from her, Twitch watched wide-eyed as four tonnes of metal careened through several trees before sliding on it's side in a shower of sparks. The tired runner searched desperately for any sign of what had happened before laughing. Off in the distance, propped up on the crest of a hill, was a small figure with a long rifle. \n\nNo other runners tried to claim on the contract. We were paid handsomely and went home with a new appreciation for our team-mates.\n\nThe moral of the story, chummer? Never get cocky.",

        "text": "Warning: If you do not know what ToS is then please refer to this link to famililarize yourself with the rules of the game. \nhttp://town-of-salem.wikia.com/wiki/Town_of_Salem_Rules\n\n\n\nSo, picture this. \n\n\nMe and my friend, Dan [ /u/legitgoat ] ,joined a game of Town of Salem in hopes to have fun and hopefully win.\n\n\nWe join and I am chosen as a Bodyguard, an ex-soldier who protects other citizens for a living. My friend is chosen as a Doctor, basically the same thing who can heal people who have been attacked, including oneself. \n\n\nThis means we are both on the Town side and need to kill the entire Evil side to win the game.\n\n\nSo, we join and trust absolutely no one.\nSuddenly, an unknown person named *Fox Mulder* started sending Dan private messages saying \"I'm Investigator.\" and Dan was suspicious.\n\n\nNow, before I go on any further; an Investigator is a role which can have a look at other players and see a list of three roles which they could possibly be.\n\n\nSo, in order to see if *Fox* was really an Investigator, we asked for one of the people who may be Mafia.\n\n\n*Fox* replied saying \"This person is either Godfather, Vigilante, or Veteran.\" which means they are either Mafia, or Good. *Fox* was so determined that the person was a Godfather. So, we trusted *Fox* and *Fox* made the whole town agree on lynching the player. The town ended up agreeing with *Fox*, making *Fox* trustworthy as the player lynched was indeed a Godfather.\n\n\nNow, let's get to the good part. \n\n*Fox* did this for 3 more players, being right every single time. Me and Dan were absolutely sure we were gonna win. \n\n\nBut... not all things have a good ending.\n\n\n\nIt is Night 6, and there is Me, Dan, *Fox* and two other players left.\n\n\nNight 7. Dan dies from a Mafia attack.\n\n\nSo, I claim to avenge Dan by lynching the last person I know cannot be trusted. But we lynch them and it is just Me, *Fox* and one other person.\n\n\nI say to *Fox*, let's lynch the last person tomorrow.\n\n\nSo, we go to sleep, anticipating the vast victory we are going to have for excellent teamwork. \n\n\nWake up. Although....\n\n\n\n\nI don't wake up.\n\n\n\n\nThe whole time *Fox* was a **Mafia** who betrayed their teammates to be trusted by me. The whole time, Me and Dan were just puppets who brought the Mafia victory closer and closer upon *Fox*. \n\n\nAt the side of my bloody deathbed, a creased and torn note, covered in blood, reads \"You never started to connect the dots, didn't you?\" \n\n\n\nMafia win.\n\n\n\n\n**The End.**\n\n\n\nThank you for reading.\n\n\n\nMe and Dan stood there for at least a good 3 minutes with our mind's blown.\n\n\n\nIt was a fantastic play, and now I am never going to trust anyone again. Not even Dan.",

        "text": "Hi again all. This story takes place in the same campaign that https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3xwmqc/shadowrun_how_to_bake_a_fingerpie_or_why/ did, still run by Red Leader. Taking place much earlier in our shadowrunnning career, none of our assorted group was aware that they were working alongside the inmates of an insane asylum. As is often the case in the Sixth World, the team had been assembled in order to complete tasks considered too dangerous or bizarre for others to even consider. \n\nSargan and Kit-Kat were life-long friends, their personalities meshing well. Sargan would calm Kit-Kat and keep her on point while Kit-Kat constantly provoked the sniper into being better. Twitch had been rescued by the pair after her partner was caught by the local law enforcement and killed. Kitten...had been found sleeping in the backyard of our team's safehouse. Given that they needed a mage, they decided to give it a shot. \n\nThe task that we had received was a seemingly simple one: Locate an item out in Canberra and transport it back to Sydney within one week. Easy enough, right? Nothing about this mission was pleasant. From our horrific accommodation to impersonating a Swedish professor and ending with a visit from legitimate Mad-Max style raiders, this was a cluster-fuck from start to finish. Let's start with us trying to get to Canberra. \n\nIt should have been the easiest thing in the world to purchase some tickets for a one-way flight to Canberra. Sure, the tickets would be slightly more expensive to account for the constant surges of wild mana that were sweeping across the continent but that was a price that we were all willing to pay. The problem? In the above post, I may have mentioned that Kitten was not only SINless but he was also only just intelligent enough to qualify for sentient life status. The team struggled in vain to explain the concept of going up into the sky in a metal bird in exchange for nuyen. It took them almost an hour before they threw up their hands in surrender, or possibly disgust, and decided that we would simply drive there. \n\nMuch more amenable to the situation now, Kitten happily helped everyone load their supplies into the colossal van that they had procured (see: stolen). After everything was packed, they headed off on their way. As you may know, road-trips are commonly filled with inane games like I-Spy and 'The Number-Plates game'. Of course, that's when normal people go on one. For runners? Now you get to play 'Favorite way to kill someone?' or 'Who hit the most powerful target?'. Typical dick measuring contest turned up to eleven. Sadly, only two of the team really got into the game. If you've read the last post then you might just be able to guess which members enjoyed trading tales of destruction.\n\nAfter Sargan and Kitten had been subjected to increasingly depraved tales of violence, the team finally arrived in Canberra. As we slowly made our way up the queue to be inspected before entering the city, Sargan came to the realization that only three of them were legal entities and that the locals would not look kindly on people smuggling. Cue murder bunnies preparing to fight their way out, Sargan desperately trying to come up with a plan and Kitten turning invisible. Problem solved, Canberra entered and professional criminals slightly embarrassed. \n\nThe second problem? Not a single one of us had even thought to book accommodation for the duration of our trip here. Even though the others hadn't even tried to help, Sargan was the one to receive our blame. He was the planner and he had failed to plan appropriately. In the midst of shouted accusations and recriminations, our team leader calmly booked four rooms at a lovely little bed and breakfast run by a charming older woman.\n\nYou might think that this basic fix was the solution to all of our problems but in truth, it only added to our woes. Little was not a word to describe the hodge-podge manor that we came across, a massive building that towered over it's neighbors. Still, it was somewhere to lay our heads while Sargan figured out how to acquire the target. We pulled into the drive-way and headed inside to meet our host. For the sake of convenience, we will call her Madge. Madge was a seventy year old woman who lived alone save for the occasional guest. She was also the second most terrifying creature that the team had ever met. We'll get to the first later in the story.\n\nOur first impression was that this sweet old lady was quite charming, if a little eccentric. That should have been the moment that warning sirens started wailing in our minds but we were oblivious to the threat lurking beneath her kindly exterior. She seated us in the parlor for a brief introduction and a bite to eat. Fresh fruit, meat and bread. For those unfamiliar with Shadowrun, nearly all food stuffs have been replaced or supplemented with krill or soy products due to lack of agricultural space for the ever-growing population. It was rare enough to encounter such delicacies in our line of work, let alone offered freely. Kitten and Twitch had eaten such things before, with Kitten growing up on wild fruits and Twitch the daughter of wealthy antiques dealers, but the others had never experienced the beauty of fresh fruit. They quickly learned that stomachs unused to such luxuries soon revolt. \n\nExcusing themselves as soon as politely possible, the pair sprinted off for their respective rooms and the toilets within. This was where we encountered the full-scope of strange that inhabited this home. Every wall was different. Different paint, different wall paper or simply different dimensions. No two walls or doors were the same. Even the windows seemed to be unique, each one somehow seeming to fit this impossible landscape. It would only be later that each team member discovered that every single room was themed. This was learned when Kitten entered his shower and found a colossal spider rearing up to devour him. His shrill screams and resultant spell-slinging brought Twitch pounding through the door, sword ready. I'm unsure of what took longer, calming the shaman down or explaining to him that it was just a shower decoration. Either way, Twitch realised that Kitten had been stowed in the Arachnid themed room while she was in the water-bed room. This does not mean a room with a water-bed, though you could be forgiven for thinking so. This means a room where the floor is an ever-shifting water-bed that constantly ebbs with the tides. \n\nWith the weirdness of this situation firmly entrenched in our minds, the group decided that we should complete our goal as soon as possible so that we could leave. There was talk of vacating the premises and finding somewhere else to stay but that would require time we did not have. So, despondently, the team chose to stay. Over the course of our time there, we encountered the following things: A chocolate fountain that produced the liquid treat from a statue's marble knob, a wall covered entirely in a magically awakened plant that liked to tickle and a large cat that remained silent while staring at you for hours on end. This was all in the first day and it got to the point that Kitten ended up sleeping in Twitch's room just to avoid the spider.\n\nThis is why we were eternally grateful that Sargan's contacts located our package with such haste. It was explained away as a strange blip that they had noticed while monitoring secure traffic channels but in reality, Sargan's player had rolled remarkably well for the first time in this campaign. It seemed that our prayers had been answered and so, with hearts full of joy, the team set off to acquire the device. The device in question was a state-of-the-art chemical something or rather that was currently held on-site at a research university on the outskirts of Canberra. \n\nNo problem. Kit-Kat can get inside...except that the facility had recently developed security protocols that rivaled that of AA Mega-corporations. Ventilation was secured tightly, armed guards were at all checkpoints and mandatory identification sweeps were made at random. This, it seemed, was not the particular role for an infiltrator. It was, to Sargan's dawning horror, the job for a face. It took a decent amount of time before we located a scientist physically reminiscent of Sargan and longer again to acquire credentials for him. All the while, Kitten and Twitch wasted days playing with a mono-filament chainsaw and some scrap in the junkyard that they were hiding in.\n\nIdentity in place, Sargan made the call. World-renowned Swedish geochemist Professor Sweedy Swissman was interested in making an appearance at the university, perhaps even delivering a lecture while he was there. The staff there ate it up and excitement spread throughout the facility. All the while, the rest of the team sat in the van trying to research geochemistry terms so that Sargan would not be completely over his head. When your researchers include a psychotic street samurai and a mentally damaged man-child, it becomes a coin-toss as to whether they help or hinder your chances of success. Still, the day crept closer and closer until Professor Swissman appeared at the front door of the facility.\n\nI will not describe the entirety of what occurred. It is safe to say that the entire team was chewing on their finger-nails the entire time, wincing at every potential encounter until Sargan managed to convince the staff to show him the prototype. At that point, Sargan's player had been on a winning streak with his rolls. None of us could believe it, especially him, but roll after roll came up his way. Until the big one. \n\nThe head researcher of that particular project wanted to speak with Professor Swissman personally and ask him for any feedback that he could offer. The rest of the team, listening through his comm-link, knew that this was the end and prepared to fight their way inside. If they had to level the building to snatch their target then so be it. Sargan had another idea. He informed the researcher that he could not make a snap judgement on such a complex piece of equipment but that he would be more than happy to study the device further and offer a detailed analysis afterwards. The dice were rolled as silence fell over the table, permeating the room. \n\nIt was as if all of the bullshit in the universe convalesced into one moment of time. That moment, as the dice informed as, was now. While the project manager was dubious about allowing anyone to study the device on their own, Professor Swissman's reputation proceeded him. If anyone could solve the issues that they were having with the device then it would be him. Thus, the team was treated to Sargan shuffling out the front door with the device in his arms. He parked his trembling body in the passenger seat of the van and we pulled away triumphantly. \n\nThe vehicle was quiet. Kitten was grinning happily at the mission being completed so easily but Twitch and Kit-Kat were smart enough to know that this should not have worked. Sargan was still in shock at his 'escape' and was incoherently muttering under his breath for the majority of out trip back. It was roughly at the point that we hit the vast stretches of nothingness that Twitch decided to look at the package and noticed a small, inconspicuous timer slowly counting down. The whatever it was had a time lock on it, so that it would be rendered useless if someone did not enter the code within 48 hours. Everyone capable of taking their eyes off the road looked at each other and sighed. It was never easy, was it?\n\nAs Sargan is trying to contact someone who can help us, an explosion rocked the van. Twitch scrambled to the rear doors and threw them open, hoping to see what was happening. Tearing up the road directly behind us was a heavily armor-plated truck with an assault cannon poking out of a specially cut firing hole in the front windshield. That explosion? That was a round from this bad-boy blasting the asphalt beside us to a fine concrete mist. The team, like the well-oiled machine that we were, sprung into action!\n\nKit-Kat started swerving wildly to avoid being splattered across the road, Sargan began desperately trying to assemble his sniper rifle while Kitten threw ineffectual spell after ineffectual spell as this armor-plated behemoth slowly closed the distance between us. What was Twitch doing, you may ask? Well, Twitch was having a wonderfully terrible idea. There was no way that they could evade this thing and as long as the team was in front of that cannon, it wasn't a matter of if they would be killed so much as when. \n\nDrawing her sword, Twitch positioned herself at the rear of the van while Sargan fumbled with his rifle parts. She demanded that Kit-Kat hit the brakes and then gun it. Kit-Kat, despite her own numerable psychological problems, screamed a number of obscenities back at her and refused to do so. It was at this point that the wind-shield disintegrated as a round ripped through it and detonated almost harmlessly ahead of us. Her options increasingly limited, Kit-Kat had no choice but to acquiesce. She slammed on the brakes, sending Kitten and Sargan slamming into one another. Twitch? She leaped from our van as soon it jerked backwards. Her target? The rapidly gaining raider vehicle. \n\nArcing through the air gracefully, Twitch gave a gleeful holler. It seemed as if she would simply splatter across the pavement when a nimble hand shot out and snagged the cannon barrel itself. Using it as leverage, Twitch spun up and onto the windshield, barring her teeth in a wicked grin that promised nothing short of annihilation for the passengers. The bandits swerved, trying to dislodge the clearly insane elf from their bonnet, but her grip held firm. With a single swipe of her blade, the cannon's turret was lopped off and sent spinning through the air. A shotgun barrel was jammed into the slot, desperately trying to rid them of their unwanted passenger. It simply gave Twitch a target and so, she jammed her sword through the slot and into the passenger. Putting all of her body weight into the swing, Twitch sliced through the windshield plating until she hit driver. \n\nWith no-one left to operate it, the vehicle began to accelerate off of the road at dangerous speeds. Her work completed, Twitch hauled herself up and over the roof in a graceful tumble to a nearby tree. It should have been short work clearing up the survivors but a shot from the distance handled it first. We investigated but found signs of nothing more than a few kangaroos in the area. A mystery for another time, we decided, and made good on our delivery attempt. We got paid, got the hell out of Canberra and made it home safely. It wasn't until much later that we found out that there were Awakened Kangaroo's actively hunting poachers in that area. We were billed for their services in blood samples.\n\nThe Moral of the story? Don't trust the wildlife, chummer.\n\nEdit: Wrong vehicle.",

        "text": "After the Occult Adventures Pathfinder expansion came out, I really wanted to run a campaign set in the Avatar universe using the kineticist class for benders. It was a bit different than games I’ve DMed before, but I was confident I could do a good job with the material.\n\nOur story takes place roughly 170 years before the events of Avatar: The Last Airbender. Avatar Roku is a small child at this point, and unaware that he even is the Avatar. With no Avatar to protect the world, three unlikely heroes have had to step up to the plate. A kind redditor was nice enough to draw our cast: https://i.imgur.com/JtgxOPC.png\n\n(From left to right)\n\nXen: A 17-year-old earthbender drifting his way around the Earth Kingdom.\n\nHimaru: A 15-year-old waterbender from the Southern Water Tribe on a quest to prove himself to his waterbending master. His player was also Lankoris in my previous story, Doing All the Wrong Things for All the Right Reasons.\n\nRomi: A 19-year-old waterbender from the Northern Water Tribe, who left because she hated the strict gender roles.\n\nChance had thrown our three heroes together in a noodle house in Shongshou village, a thriving port town on the western coast of the Earth Kingdom. A very drunk merchant was making a scene in between pounding shots of sake.\n\nMerchant: I’m ruined! I paid a sizable amount of gold for a shipment of goods from Ba Sing Se, but the cart driver was ambushed by thugs before he reached town!\n\nHimaru pulled up a stool at the bar and ordered a cup of tea.\n\nHimaru: Calm down, friend. I believe I may be able to help you out. See, I happen to be a waterbender. I could take down those bandits for you and get your stuff back.\n\nMerchant: Splendid! I would pay you handsomely, of course. The driver said it happened a few miles up the northern road out of town.\n\nHimaru slurped down his tea and stood up.\n\nHimaru: I’ll have your stuff back before you know it. Hey, the two of you look capable, want to give me a hand?\n\nRomi: Sure, I’m down to make some extra money.\n\nXen shrugged and tagged along with them as they walked out the door.\n\nHimaru: All right, the first thing we’ll need is a cart to haul the stuff back. I propose we borrow one from someone in the market.\n\nXen: You mean steal one?\n\nHimaru: It’s not stealing if we give it back afterwards.\n\nThe three walked over to the market, where merchants of all sorts were hawking their goods from stalls and carts.\n\nHimaru: I look around for a produce merchant.\n\nMe: As it so happens, you see a man with a cart piled full of cabbages.\n\nHimaru: All right guys, let’s come up with a plan. I’ll distract him while you two grab the cart and run.\n\nRomi and Xen got into position while Himaru approached the merchant.\n\nHimaru: Hello, kind sir. You sell cabbages?\n\nCabbage Merchant: Why, yes I do! I sell cabbages just like my father did, and his father before him.\n\nHimaru: Are they any good?\n\nCabbage Merchant: I can guarantee that you won’t find better cabbages anywhere in the Earth Kin- HEY!\n\nMeanwhile, Romi and Xen had snuck up and grabbed the cart. The merchant tried to chase after them, but Himaru shot a blast of ice at his feet, freezing him to the ground. Romi and Xen turned a corner into an alley, accidentally slamming into the side of the building and spilling several cabbages.\n\nCabbage Merchant: MY CABBAGES!\n\nThe three regrouped at the northern gate of the town and headed up the road. Himaru decided to hide underneath the cabbages while the other two pulled the cart, so if the bandits ambushed them, he would have the element of surprise.\n\nAfter some time of walking, they came upon a burned-out horse-ostrich cart.\n\nRomi: That must have been the merchant’s cart. Keep your guard up.\n\nA few minutes later, two men carrying daggers stepped out of the trees.\n\nBandit: My, those are some nice looking cabbages, and my friend and I are very hungry. Why don’t you two just give us that wagon nice and easy-like so you don’t get hurt? We also want all the money you have.\n\nRomi, not one to be pushed around, drew her spear and leapt into action. The two benders fought valiantly, but the bandits got a few good hits in.\n\nRomi: WE COULD USE SOME HELP!\n\nHimaru burst from underneath the pile of cabbages and promptly botched his acrobatics roll, landing in a heap on the ground. However, his arrival was enough to turn the tide, and Himaru finished one off by stabbing him in the back with his dagger while Xen knocked the other out with some rocks.\n\nAfter dealing with the highwaymen, Himaru tracked their footprints back to their camp, where they found a stack of wooden crates. Romi dumped the cabbages out of the cart and began loading the crates onto it. They were extremely heavy, and clanged when moved. Xen lifted the top off of one to reveal several finely-crafted weapons.\n\nHimaru: What could he need those for?\n\nXen: He’s probably a weapons merchant.\n\nHimaru: Oh, yeah. What about the cabbages?\n\nRomi: We don’t have room for them. Also, I’m not pulling your lazy ass back to town. You’re walking.\n\nHimaru picked up a few cabbages and carried them in his shirt as they walked back. As the trio passed back through the northern gate, they spotted the cabbage merchant flanked by several Earth Kingdom soldiers.\n\nCabbage Merchant: That’s them, officer! Those are the ruffians that stole MY CABBAGES!\n\nHimaru was so startled he let go of his shirt, spilling cabbages all over the ground and certainly not helping his case.\n\nXen: Cops! Run!\n\nThe group bolted, but were stopped when the soldiers bended some stones from the ground that pinned them in place.\n\nGuard Captain: Cart thieves, eh? Men, load them onto a prison wagon, we’re taking them to Ba Sing Se for judgement.\n\nHimaru: Dammit.\n\nMe: I love how our sessions always begin with you stealing something.",

        "text": "We begin out adventure on the morning after a grand party with the satryrs and dryads.  Strangely, there is no trace of them.  The party was ill equipped for adventuring in a frozen cave and everyone woke up tired and stiff.\n\nSoon after breakfast, Krampus' voice resounded through the cavern.  He taunted the party and offered Ash a shiny new glaive.  The gift was too good to be true, and as Ash grabbed for it, two tentacles grappled him and pulled him forth.  It was a mimic, a cruel trick by Krampus.\n\nDuring the fight, Alli slipped on some ice, fell, and hit her head.  Gylian managed to kick her awake as he attacked.  Ash was bitten mercilessly.  Finally, Alli reared up and crushed the mimic.  Taking a short rest, the party found a bundle of sticks.  After studying it, they found it to be Ruten, one of the tokens of krampus.  \n\nKrampus interrupted the short rest with vicious taunts and laughter.  Alli grabbed the Ruten, and the party headed on further into the cavern.\n\nSeeing a light at the end of a cavern, the party stumbled into Krampus' kitchen.  Gylian, Alli, and Ash attacked.  The fight started to look good, when krampus's hair got into his eyes, and he missed an attack.  It went downhill from there.  Gylian slipped off a table and it bashed Argon.  Then a huge hit split off a chunk of Krampus and a mini-krampus sprouted where the chunk landed.\n\nKrampus nailed Ash with a huge rending attack and Ash went down.  Argon shoved a goodberry into his mouth, getting him up.  Alli took a hit and went down.  Gylian got her up and she then disengaged and headed to the back of the room.  Ash got the idea that he needed fire to do real damage to krampus, and wrapped an arrow in webbing from his spider, ran it though his 'hair', and fired it.\n\nAsh took one of his dragon breath bolts, crushed it into a bottle of fine liquor, and lit up the room with flames.  A second mini-Krampus sprouted, and attacked Ash, again dropping him unconscious.  Gylian soon fell as well.  Alli kept moving away, but lost her way in the darkness.  Taking advantage of the situation, Gylian and Ash got back up.\n\nAsh sent his spider out to check on Alli and the spider was able to feed her a goodberry and get her back headed toward the right direction.  In the kitchen, Ash threw his last bottle of fine alcohol and burned up a mini-Krampus.  Gylian jumped forth to tank, and completely missed, but seeing the damage the fire did, he grabbed a chunk of ruten from the counter, lit it, and began using it against Krampus.\n\nFrom watching Ash strike with his ruten, he knew he only had four good hits before it crumbled to ashes.  Ash used his last bit of ruten to attack Krampus, but missed and fell unconscious again, and a mini-Krampus bit his knee cap off.\n\nAlli fired an arrow from the sidelines, but slipped and it lodged in her thigh.  Falling from the pain, she too went unconscious again.  With that distraction, the party waqs able to finish the fight.  It was the most challenging encounter they had ever seen.\n\nThey took a short rest, licked their wounds, and forged on.  Everyone noted their equipment.  Their boots were worn, leather armor scratched and pitted, and clothing was ragged.  Nothing had prepared them for the life and death challenges they had seen in the past two weeks.\n\nMoving to the north, Gylian slipped on an ice flow and fell, sliding down to the bottom.  Using caution, Ash sent his spider on ahead.  The spider saw a strange glyph on the floor, and Ash decided to copy it.  As he finished the final stroke, he realized that it was a summoning symbol.  A flock of Steam mephits appeared and attacked.  Ash took the brunt of their breath weapons and dropped straight away.\n\nWhile down, Alli stumbled while shooting an arrow and killed Ash.  Mephits surrounded his spider and ate it.  Gylian and Alli were able to kill the rest of the mephits, and drag Ash's body to a storage room.  While there, they took what equipment they could salvage from him, and put his body to rest.  While on lookout, Gylian saw a last mephit, and was able to kill it.\n\nThe party spent their second restless night in the ice caves of krampus.",

(I planned on using him as a NPC, that might be a little difficult as you'll see.)\n\nSo a little background\nMy world is set in a Victorianish era, and it is a world that has never known magic, there are legends of course but nothing to take seriously \nuntil one day that quaint interest everyone has in the occult suddenly gets a whole lot more real. \nStrange rumors of strange happenings begin to circulate. \nLike \" OH SHIT I actually talked to a ghost\" and\nHOLY FUCK this metal encased giant beast just ate my leg, and my family, AND MY ENTIRE FUCKING TOWN!\nSo amidst all this the various kingdoms of the world are collectively being skull fucked by their own worse nightmares. \nThe one area  that seems unshaken by the attack is one of the three kingdoms of Tridenti, known as Elsroth.\n Elsroth lead by Queen Elizabeth stands resolute, quietly dispatching threats and remaining relatively stable.\nThen the queens eldest daughter Emma, disappears suddenly and with what looks like signs of both a struggle and not a struggle at the same time. \nPanic and Confusion at the royal disco!                     \n    So this one shady guy, hoping to better gain the Queen, and really everyone's favor, (poor shit just wants to be loved for something besides the stabby stab) decided to undergo a rare ritual known as a spiritwalk, to investigate rumors of an abnormal strangeness occurring at this usually predictable strange tower. \n     Guy goes into a trance tries to go to tower. Nope tower ain't have none of that, do not pass go, do not collect 200 gold\nSo Caius trys again the next night, and succeeds. \nIn having his spirit materialize a mile form the tower.\nShit.. .Damm.. Horse.. and other such displeased grumblings are whispered as are hero begins his skulking trek through the woods on spirit foot. \nAfter a while hero hears a rustling but he skulks by like the pro creeper he is.  Still he worries about the possibility that given this tower's nature it has defenses even against a sly BOO Ghost like him.  \nA little way later more rustling. No skulk here but our arrogant hero isn't afraid, he faces the threat.\nand promptly shoulder throws a LEAPING DIRE WOLF into a nearby tree. NoFUCKsgiven.jpg    \nCombat ensues and out of the 4 wolves (3 dire one req) all but one run away when they see this guys ball of steel dragging the ground.\nBut not one wolf NO. this wolf roles a double 20 and decides he has seen bigger balls than this guy. He attacks\n\nDuring the battle both pretty messed up with the highlights being-\n\nWhen the wolf gets stuck on Cauis arm for like five minutes while cauis tries to stab him and meets with only partial success.\n\nWhen cauis falls on top of the wolf and then engage in a wrestling match \n\nWhen the wolf in a wonderfully metal move further impales his leg on Cauis sword so as to gouge his shoulder.\n\nThroughout the fight this wolf (brave-wolf) has been trying to call to his pack and Cauis using the mimicry skill has been trying to call them to his side. He DESPITE BEING THE ONE WHO IS NOT A WOLF has been having greater success.\nFinally the wolves arrive to find both Brave -wolf and Cauis heavily wounded and so through a series of bullshit  Cauis gets the idea to assert himself as alpha of these wolves \nRoll to have your meaning be understand\nNat 20\nConfirmed Crit.\nEven Brave-wolf recognizes your bad-assery, you are the leader of this pack of wolfs. \nThey rest up and, upon being ambushed by bug bears, decide to treat said bugbears to a breakfast of pain and brutal death. (free of charge)       \n\nThey finally draw close to the tower and enter. The wolves are taken on a magic ride when the carpet animates itself, while two magic swords prepare to cut Caius down.\n\nCauis, like a motherfucker, plucks one sword out of the air, and deflects the other sword with it.\n As the wolves tear free of the carpet, both swords are suitably pissed.\nThe sword deflected by Cauis goes to cut him again but both times fails to pierce  his AC. \nCue  an existential crises as the sword looks at himself in mirror \nMeanwhile sword in Cauis hand is vibrating like an overworked laptop and despite his abysmal speeds, his dial up tone is clear. I WANT TO MURDER KILL YOU BRUV! What does are hero do??? \n\nCiaus promises the sword that he can show it things beyond this tower,  he promises  to show it, \"A WHOLE NEW WORLD\". (Cue song)\nRolls poorly for song but NAT 20 for persuasion \nHis voice is terrible but the sword is moved by its meaning and the sword joins Cauis gladly. \nThe other sword still floating around in a haze is dutifully subdued by brave wolf. \n\nSo who should show up to this magic singalong of bullshit? Why the king of bullshit himself. \nYes the mad god makes himself known, and after having pressured Cauis sufficiently, gets him to \"play a game\" with a mysterious deck of cards. \nCauis draws a card and his persuasion goes up even more. Great. \nKing crazy disappears and all seems well when a mysterious female voice is heard by Cauis Gray abd his wolves and suddenly everything goes back.\nTLDR smooth talking assassin goes on a spirit   walk and sweet talks his way into becoming a pretty solid meme not suited for competitive play.

        "text": "Some years ago now, a few friends and I had gathered to play 4th Edition Shadowrun. Our GM, who we will call Red Leader (In honor of Star Wars coming out and because he has red hair), was desperate to introduce us to the game since he thought that we would enjoy it. In truth, we did and continue to do so weekly. So, with the thought of cyber-punk magi-crimes in mind, a team was assembled.\n\nSargan - An elvish face/sniper extraordinaire with the ability to talk or shoot his way out of any situation...until he had to roll dice for it. This was the start of Sargan's player developing an ongoing three year case of bad luck when it comes to dice rolls. This will be important later in the story.\n\nKit-Kat - An elvish infiltration expert with a sarcastic streak the size of Australia. She was in, out, back in to have one more peek and then out before anyone ever realized that she was there. There were a few unfortunate traits that she had, such as an allergy to fish and an addiction to psyche, that may have affected her outlook on life somewhat.\n\nKitten - A human (genetically if not mentally) tribal shaman that had been kidnapped at a young age and taught the honorable method of blowing people up with magic or stabbing them with a spear. Uneducated to the point of not being able to read, naive enough to believe whatever anyone told him and powerful enough to drop a building on someone. Not a great combination for a covert agent. He was also as dull as a polished spoon, even if he thought himself clever. This led to his catchphrase becoming 'I'm not stupid, you know?'. Recently, he had hand-crafted a collapsible spear that was perfectly suited to him. This will also come up later in the story.\n\nAnd finally: Twitch. Twitch was poetry in motion, a love-story to ultra-violence and high-octane destruction. Once the humble daughter of affluent antiques dealers, this young elvish woman had developed the skills to kill anything within her line of sight. Coupled with the ridiculous amount of bioware in her body, Twitch ascended through the ranks of street-samurai to become something...terrifying. Her other exploits include killing a heavily armored, auto-cannon armed van with her sword and butchering an entire drug cartel's made men within all of thirty seconds. \n\nAs you can see, this is a very eclectic group with a wide variety of skills. The team was based out of Sydney, sharing a large cottage on the outskirts of the city. In Red Leader's Shadowrun Universe, Australia is constantly pummeled by intense Mana Storms that have highly unpredictable effects. For instance, a mana storm swept through a small town and turned everyone there into golden statues of themselves. On top of that, Sydney had seceded from Australia and was now operating as a well fortified city-state. This led to some interesting attempts to smuggle Kitten, who was entirely SINless (Lacking any form of identity for the non-runners out there), through the borders. As entertaining as all of that was, it had nothing on our very last mission of that campaign. It was not the last because we retired the characters but because of how monumentally fucked they would have been had they stayed where they were.\n\nThe task was a relatively simple one: We were to intimidate a local biker gang into backing down and away from some choice territory. Our targets were the Chullora Cheetah's, known as such because of their love for high-velocity vehicles. The mission needed to be completed within one week and casualties for the go-gangers kept to a minimum. The pay was good and violence was involved; we were in. \n\nAs should be the first port of call for any paranoid runner team, we decided to gather some information on the target and their headquarters. The team moved in under the cover of night and the shroud of invisibility that Kitten provided (One of the few non-combat spells that he could manage). A large abandoned  train-yard that the group had retrofitted so that it required some incredibly tricky maneuvers on a bike to get in or some specialized climbing gear. Alright, bizarre but not game-changing. We also discovered that there were two rival gangs in the area who were planning to move on the Cheetah's soon. Does this gang have bad luck or what? \n\nThe answer is no and go screw yourself with a rusty fish-hook, chummer. The reason? The Chullora Cheetah's were in tight with the local law enforcement in a big way. We never figured it out but these guys were the best of pals. Sargan went bar-hopping and, with the help of liquid stupidity, found out that the security forces routinely offered ballistic support when the Chullora's went to war.\n\n\"Ah. That makes things a little more difficult.\" Sargan thought to himself. Sargan may have been our long range over-watch and the team's social expert but he was also responsible for keeping us all alive. This meant coming up with a suitable plan and reining us in when the less tactical of the group came up with their own schemes. Caught up as he was in his strategic development, Sargan failed to fulfill his role in the group. Kit-Kat and Twitch, impatient at the best of times, had come up with their own plan. \n\nThey were going to bake a finger-pie. \n\nTheir idea was a straight-forward one. The duo would sneak into one of the rival gang's hangouts, kill them all and cut off their fingers. They would then bake the fingers into a pie, Mrs Lovett style, and deliver it to the Cheetah's with a vaguely threatening message. Yes, they decided, that would do the trick. If it didn't then Sargan could always be as dreadfully clever as he usually was and come up with a plan. \n\nThey were skipping off on their merry way when Kitten reported that there were other people heading into the area. Alright, it may have been slightly less intelligible than that but it got the point across. A little bit of recon later and we discovered that the other gangs were sending a message of their own. While Sargan was cursing under his breath and Kitten was scratching his ass, the would-be-bakers' eyes lit up with delight. Now they wouldn't even have to leave the area for their plan to work. Today was looking up!\n\nI will not describe the massacre that occurred. Suffice to say, Red Leader became a frustrated mess as the two carved their way through a dozen street toughs like a monofilament sword through butter. After about twelve seconds of combat, the girls had the ingredients they needed...except for anything even slightly related to baking a pie. It was here that they stumbled upon the next flaw in their plan: Neither of them could bake worth a damn. \n\nWhile they pondered what to do next, Sargan was watching them silently through his scope. As a psychological chatter-box, this was something of a big deal for him. After all, it's not every day that you realise you're working with a pair of psychopaths. Alas, poor Sargan, the shit has only just begun to roll downhill. Snapping out of his funk, the face tried desperately to convince them that was a terrible plan and that the finger pie was sure to get them killed. \n\nAfter listening to his well constructed argument, they agreed. Sargan let a breath of relief slip past his lips, as Kitten let loose with a tremendous fart, when it all came crashing down. \n\n\"Fuck the pie!\" They had decided. \"We'll just throw the fingers at them!\"\n\nIf this had been a movie, this would be the scene where Sargan's shattered dreams are accompanied by an appropriately poignant song. As it was, he could only watch on helplessly as the pair scaled the defenses bare handed and began to head inside. \n\n\"We have no idea how many of them are in there!\" That just made it fun! \"I can't cover you inside the warehouse!\" Don't worry, they won't need it! \"We haven't even finished the recon yet!\" That sounds like a problem for someone else!\n\nWatching as the pair finally made it up the walls and inside, Sargan went through all of the options presented to him. Since he was stuck on overwatch almost a full kilometer away, he would have to send someone in after them. It was with a sinking feeling of dread that Sargan appointed Kitten the task of making sure that they stayed alive. Kitten, just happy to finally be doing something, turned invisible and levitated over the wall. Landing quietly atop a rusted train car, the shaman began searching for his teammates. \n\nA number of things happened all at once. First, Twitch located a meeting of the Cheetah's higher ups by bursting through the door with a manic grin on her face. Second, Kit-Kat found the kitchen and was throttling the kindly old woman behind the grill unconscious. Third, Kitten overheard a pair of the Cheetah's gripping about how late the heads of the other gangs were. There was meant to be a massive feast after the peace talks had concluded and these guys were hungry. \n\nSargan, having overheard everything through Kitten's commlink, froze. Those heavies that the girls had slaughtered like so many helpless sheep were diplomats from the other gangs, not assassins like the team had originally thought. Our esteemed leader took in all of this information before flipping out and demanding the girls leave, right the fuck now! \n\nSadly, this train was already in motion with no chance of stopping it. Twitch, ignoring the little voice in her ear as she often did, sprung into action and started bludgeoning people with the hilt of her sword. Three of them were out before the rest realized what was going on. Then the desperate scrabble for weaponry commenced. Meanwhile, Kit-Kat was glaring at the oven in the hopes that it would convert the bag of fingers she carried into a finger-pie. So focused on the unrelenting mechanical scumbag in front of her that she didn't notice one of the guards outside readying to blow her away.\n\nSadly for him, he didn't notice Kitten drop down behind him until a spear slammed through his shoulder and into the train car next to him. This streak of not noticing things was broken as the ganger's automatic weapon started advertising the sheer amount of wrongness that was going on. Alarms sounded, guards were arming up and Sargan wept quietly to himself as he watched from his vantage point. \n\nWith klaxons blaring, Kit-Kat decided the game was up. She went charging through the building, beating people with a chair leg until they moved. She only stopped running when she found Twitch, laughing manically as she fought two dozen  heavily armed and understandably frightened gang members. Their terror reached a crescendo when Kit-Kat smashed through the window, rolled to her feet and emptied the bag of fingers onto the floor. Silence reigned as the last digit hit the ground, all eyes on the pile of pointers. Kit-Kat gestured to the fingers, laughed and sprinted away with Twitch right behind her. \n\nKitten faced a conundrum of his own. His one-of-a-kind spear was lodged firmly in the rusty carriage wall. With a little bit of time, he might be able to retrieve it but there were several large men with guns bearing down on him and he was already bleeding from several small holes in his body. There really was first time for everything as Kitten decided to do the smart thing, rolling under the carriage and away. He reconnoitered with the others as they ramped a pair of dirt-bikes over the wall, laughing madly the entire way. \n\nSkip forward two days. No payment has been received for completing the run, our safe-house was burned to the ground in a remarkable accident and we are being actively hunted by the Chullora Cheetah's along with their now staunch allies. Twitch reasoned that we had been through worse and that this would all blow over in time. She kept up with this train of thought until they found Kitten dead in their backyard, his missing spear on fire and lodge through his brain. The team wisely decided that it might be time to call it quits and go our separate ways. \n\nThe moral of the story? Reconnaissance is important, chummers.\n",

        "text": "With winter break started, we've gotten a new Pathfinder game running. Our first session was.. interesting, to say the least.\n\nIn the massive, clockwork city of Chrona, three individuals of importance to our story have walked into Tevaga's Tavern for different reasons. The first to enter is a catfolk by the name of Corrick. Having recently been kicked off his ship for talking about how he was going to one day defeat the captain and take over within easy hearing distance of said captain. He had wandered here to go get incredibly intoxicated and chat up other drunkards.\n\nThe second attendee was an albino tiefling named Nauss Baru. He had recently graduated from his university, double majoring in alchemy and empirical studies with a minor in philosophy, and needed to think about his plans for starting his investigation business over a warm meal and a mug of hard cider.\n\nThe last to enter was the stunning human model of masculinity known only as Douglas. He was heading towards a nearby monestary and had ducked into the tavern (it was actually an inn but Tevaga's Inn just didn't sound as good) for a quick bite to eat.\n\nAside from a few off duty guards bothering Nauss about his races affiliation with demons that were soon chased off by Tevaga, the three drank excessively, pondered, and ate respectively at their own tables in general peace before purchasing rooms and retiring for the night. But just as they were settling in, they heard a commotion downstairs. Nauss was curious and headed towards the stairs. Corrick, on the other hand, immediately sat up, screamed something about being under attack, and burst out of his room, flailing wildly with his machete. Nauss turned around to find a crazed cat-man bearing down on him with a large blade and immediately decided to nope the fuck out of this situation by diving down the stairs.\n\nDownstairs, the two drunken guards from earlier had come back to trash the place but were interrupted in the middle of debauchery when a pasty white tiefling came diving down the stairs and hid behind the bar as a humanoid cat followed soon after, screaming about pirates and slashing at the walls. Corrick eventually remembered he was no longer on a ship and stopped flailing to process the situation. He was just about to tell the guards to leave when Douglas, who had come down to investigate and decided to do the exact same thing as Corrick just in a different fashion, blew past him and grabbed one of the guards. He was planning to pin the guard against a wall before making his request. However, there was not a wall behind the guard but a full length window. Douglas didn't even flinch as he and the guard went through the window and a good twenty feet outside before stopping.\n\nCorrick took this opportunity to point his weapon at the other guard and told him to get out of here. With a weapon pointed at him and his friend through a window, he complied and the other ran off as well after Douglas finally let go of him. After Nauss checked on Tevaga, the three made their introductions before more guards came and brought them to the barracks under charges of property damage and harassing guardsmen.\n\nThe three were introduced to Knight Captain Robert who offered them a few choices, they could be tried for their actions, they could pay a fine, or they could do a little community service. The guards had recently occupied a graveyard in the poor district because they believed a noble had been buried with a magic item of some importance. If the three would go to the tomb that was being guarded and retrieve the box then all charges would be dropped as well. Seeing as how the fine was ridiculously high and no one wanted to have trouble with the courts, they decided to do the community service in the morning.\n\nAfter a decent night's sleep, the three went off to the tomb, grumbling and complaining about guards and authority in general as they went. The guards standing there let them in after making a snarky comment about trying not to die horribly and the adventure was on. The first trap was a basic pressure plate. This was easily avoided by the party's leet acrobatics skillz. Next was the bottomless pit. The party all worked i unison and jumped over the pit, where they immediately stepped on the pressure plates on the other side and were shot with arrows.\n\nNauss- \"Who the hell puts a pit and arrow traps in a burial site in public domain in the middle of a god damn city?\"\n\nCorrick- \"Assholes, that's who.\"\n\nThe next room had a downward slope and more pressure plates. Nauss was about halfway through the room when Corrick tripped and face-planted onto a plate. They took the rumbling as a bad sign and dove into the notches in the hallway as a giant boulder blew past them. Then they had to dive back into the notches as they peaked out and learned that that boulder had triggered the pressure plate for the **second** giant boulder. Suffice to say, the group was pretty sick of this tomb's shit by the time they made it to where the bodies were buried. The went through the main chamber to the back where the really important people are always buried and found in front of a big, fancy coffin was a small, ornate, wooden box, sitting on top of a pedestal, sitting on top of another freaking pressure plate.\n\nWith the collective opinion being \"screw this place and it's traps\" the other two waited by the door while Nauss got ready to snatch it. Whatever trap activated, the party didn't see as they were already bolting for the exit the instant Nauss grabbed the box. After gunning it at full speed around the plates and over the pit, they made it back up to the surface, greatly suprising the guards as they burst through the doors gasping for breath. The party quickly composed themselves and walked of to the barracks like nothing had happened, leaving whatever hell-spawn they had just released to the people who were paid to guard against such things.\n\nKnight Captain Robert thanked the party for their deeds and raised the offer to do more community service, this time for pay. As a final favor, he asked them to deliver the box to the royal artificer in the royal district. This trip was rather uneventful aside from the gnome artificer constantly telling Corrick not to touch anything and throwing a ball of yarn at him. Racist. On the trip back, the group discussed themselves and their general distaste for the people they had just worked for, and decided they would be willing to work together again should the opportunity present itself. They returned to Tevaga's Tavern, who had just gotten their window repaired, toasted to their first successful adventure together, then turned in for the night.",

        "text": "So, there's four or fiveish ninteen-hundred-something adventurers on a mission to go invade a big city and stage a jailbreak to advance the plot. But, in order to get there, they need to travel through a war-torn land of danger and intrigue. So they all step up and enter some nameless Austro-hungarian place that I can't be arsed to remember, start getting comfortable and making plans, and then those plans catch fire and die screaming. First thing they find out upon entering the town is that the local residents come in two flavors: Shady and terrified. And the shady folks were giving blatantly bad advice for where some travellers could go for a good time.\n\nWell, the party showed up to the shady alley where the nefarious thugs were waiting, and then proceeded to be \"rescued\" from their predicament by a masked figure in spandex who crit failed his first roll and dynamically faceplanted onto the scene. So entered Virgil Ante, hero at large! He was there to help should the fight go south, but it ended up being unnecessary. The party made short work of the mooks with a mixture of fire breath, spine-shattering punches, and drowning the survivors in raw sewage. Remember, these are the GOOD guys!\n\nAnyway, it turns out that Virgil the hero had his very own villain counterpart. Sanguine Scarlett, the charming assassin behind the nefarious events going on in town! She was kidnapping people from their homes and murdering them, so that she could sell their corpses off to the Austro-Hungarian military (because necromancy is easier than conscription and, say, tactics). Naturally the party decided that this shit needed to be stopped. But, having blown most of their spells on melting people's faces and drowning them in semiliquid shit, they needed to rest and recuperate in Virgil Ante's Generic Hero Base, that of the menacing clocktower. So naturally while they were there Virgil spent the entire time staring out at the night sky and trying to be batman with all his might.\n\nOkay, there was a LITTLE more to the situation. Turns out Virgil was once a part of the organization that the party belonged to, so technically they were comrades. The problem was that Virgil had been abusing the local Time Travel Macguffin and annihilated himself from history. As in, nobody remembered his name. Not even him! Or his close comrades that had fallen prey to the exact same events! Like, say, Scarlett. Turns out they had been on the same team once, and she'd been kind of a... creepy stalker type. And then, the object of her affection was annihilated from reality, and the little Yandere cogwheels in her brain fractured into teensy little Love Freak shards, and she snapped with the fury of a thousand unrequited Desus, becoming obsessed with the idea of love prevading death (and thus, death not being something to fear or avoid).\n\nIn short, just about goddamn everyone in the universe EXCEPT Virgil was perfectly happy with the idea of shooting her in her psychotic animesque face. But since Virgil was a stand-up guy, the party decided to give rehabilitation a shot, and set off on a mission to capture the crazy bitch.\n\nLong story short, the party wound up on a big old boat filled with a bunch of \"tourists\" who were riding \"free\", and would definitely not be \"murdered in their sleep and their corpses sold off for a tidy profit with their families none the wiser\". The boat was naturally filled with rent-a-mooks, that the party promptly charmed, mind-screwed, regular screwed, pistol-whipped and threw overboard after stealing all of their stuff. Remember, these are the HEROES! It's okay when they do it! The next objective was to take down Scarlett herself, along with her personal little retinue of elite mercenaries.\n\nWell, seeing as the villains were currently camped out in a small room with no windows, discussing how best to hunt down and murder the \"infuriating interlopers\" that kept \"getting in the way of love\", the party came up with a brilliant plan. They'd recently looted a bunch of premium-strength opiates from the cargo hold, and they figured that a bunch of tripping balls opponents would be easier to deal with than a bunch of alert-and-trying-to-murder-you opponents. That was correct, as far as it went, but then the party's Wizard tried to use his makeshift 420 grenade. Said wizard has a nasty reputation for being a fuckup, a drunkard, and being ridiculous. So naturally the first thing he does while holding the lit opium bomb is roll to throw it, and get a total of 7. So he drops it.  And then he tries to kick it before it goes off, and rolls a total of 6. And then he rolls to resist going on the mother of all trips, and he crit fails the fuck out of it.\n\nAnd that was how the party of scheming villains was caught completely off-guard by one of their targets bursting through the door in an opium haze, his foot on fire, his hat askew, and promptly slamming facefirst into the table and pissing himself. There was a moment of awkward silence before Scarlett decided to take action and drew her knife. Surprisingly, this was only the BEGINNING of a big conga line of questionable decisions, poor rolls, and completely avoidable fuckups.\n\nThe party Psionic used some spooky powers to crush Scarlett to the ground, which triggered her Escape Clause and she poofed away. The party sorcerer decided to lend assistance by blasting a flaming hole in the door. It accomplished little more than putting himself in range of the VILLAIN'S sorcerer, who crispy fried the unfortunate party member. He barely survived. The villain's fighter tried to bust through a door to get to the Psionic, but the psionic was holding the door and the whole thing devolved into a retarded push-of-war. And through it all, Virgil was lending assistance by vaulting in and laying the hurt on the unfortunate enemy sorcerer.\n\nOh, and the fucking wizard was still trying to cast spells. Emphasis on TRYING. Being stoned out of not only his brain, but everyone else's brain, he was well and truly past 10 on the Highness Chart and was rocking some insights to the deepest understandings of the universe. Which he promptly tapped into for lulz. The results were as incredible as they were unpredictable and laughably stupid. But, for the sake of relevance, the most spectacular thing he did was turn every wooden thing within a mile radius into stone. Like, for example, the boat that they were all riding.\n\nThe enemy sorcerer discovered this as he tried to use a Gust of Wind to blast himself out through the roof, and promtly gave himself a concussion. The enemy fighter discovered this when the animated chair legs that were trying to throttle him suddenly became impossible to break out of. And the party themselves discovered this when the boat began to sink. I mean, not all at once, it was still watertight and stuff, but they were suddenly riding a LOT lower in the water. Anyway, Virgil did a heroic leap and punched the enemy sorcerer in the face, toppling him off his rooftop perch and sending him two stories down to land head-first on a guard rail. From there, the party quickly mopped up and slapped the tripping wizard awake before he could do any more retarded things. But there was still the issue of Scarlett herself, who had been very carefully waiting and watching for an opportunity to send any unprepared party members to the great big anime convention in the sky.\n\n&gt; PSIONIC: We should definitely NOT split up.\n\n&gt; GUNSLINGER: Eh? Split up? That sounds like a great idea!\n\n&gt; PARTY: ***NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO***\n\nWith that, the gunslinger valiantly threw himself off the boat, leaving the psionic completely exposed. Scarlett struck like lightning, bypassing the psionic's not-inconsiderable defenses and burying a knife in his neck for an instantly lethal strike. Fort save vs death, and... NATURAL. FUCKING. TWENTY. The psionic completely No Sell'd the attack, knocked the assassin on her ass, shut down her final getaway spell and had the rest of the party on her in seconds. GG no re\n\nWith that, the party found that the boat had conveniently taken them to their exact destination, because it apparently it ran on plot (secretly, all vehicles do). With that, they were FINALLY able to put a stop to the retarded sidequest, give a heartfelt goodbye to Virgil (who had been a total bro), and FINALLY advance the main story. They just desperately hoped that their return journey would be less eventful.",

        "author": "Mr_Conelrad",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3xqea6/dd_5e_adventures_in_civics_using_legal_loopholes/",
        "text": "Hello, everyone! This is my first time posting here, although my characters have been featured in other stories posted here ([see Rogan of Pelor](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3etyz7/dnd_35pathfinder_killing_the_king_of_hell_the/)). \n\nHowever, this is a different campaign, most of the same players, but a different DM. The story goes like this so far:\n\nThe party, (wizard, rouge, paladin, and cleric), have been sent by the Church of Pelor to retrieve the Sun Shard, part of powerful Pelorian artifact that was shattered and lost to the four corners of the world. The church has gathered about 1/3 (maybe it was 2/3) of them, and sends us to get the rest. We travel to a small town called Eidleways Oasis, a literal oasis surrounded by scorched, desolate earth, the remains of a battle long ago in which a group of warriors used a Sun Shard to shield their forces from an onslaught by Fire Demons. The shard was lost, and the shield left an oasis while all else was destroyed. Eventually a town sprang up, and relied mostly on tourism.\n\nThe party arrives in the town and starts to track down leads. The only location of note is a mine about a mile outside of town, where people can pay to try and find gold, and keep what they mine. (Imagine places in the US where you can pay to try and find geodes). We arrive and find out from the mineowner before we go in that there are some gnomes living in the lower levels of the mine, and they leased the rights to live and mine down there from him. Unfortunately, his papers have been stolen, and asks us to get them back for him. We tell him we will see what we can do, and head down into the depths.\n\nWe notice that our **light** spell is about twice as powerful as normal, so we figure out that the Sun Shard must be close. At the bottom of the shaft, we encounter a community of about 50 gnomes living and working in this mine. They say they worship Pelor, as it is his blessing that sustains them (they use the power of the shard, combined with divine magic to transmute the gold into delicious food). They have different ideas that the mainstream church of Pelor, so they don't recognize the Writ we bring from the church. We eat with them and try to figure out a plan to get the shard, but we don't want to kill them. They're good people, but we have a quest to complete.\n\nWe fairly easily get them to return the stolen papers (some gnome kid stole them as a \"joke.\") So we head up the mine. We had figured the options we had were to:\n\n* Kill them and take the shard\n\n* Hire someone to kill them and take the shard. (Neither of these were attractive due to killing innocents and all that.)\n\n* Steal the shard while they slept (kind of hard since it is extremely bright)\n\n* Figure out a trade for it (they didn't want anything we had)\n\n* Abandon the quest and leave the ~~heretics~~ reformed church of Pelor in peace.\n\n\nHorace (my character, a wizard), gets an idea. He haggles with the mineowner to sell him the deed to the mine (ends up paying 85GP for it). Out of character, I have a fair knowledge about leases and legal documents, so I ask about the lease that the gnomes signed with the former owner. Turns out, they never included a clause that says in the case that the mine is sold, the lease remains in effect, so we used that against them. We said, since the lease was between the old owner and the gnomes, when the mine was sold, the lease was not transferred to the new owner, and they are being evicted.\n\nNow, Horace is a fair man. With the help of the Cleric of Pelor, they gather 2 barrels of ale, a weeks worth of rations for 50 gnomes, and the services of a cart for the day of the move. When delivering the eviction notice, we give them the ale and rations and say they have 1 week to mine as much gold for themselves as they can, to help pay for their new life they will start. The rations are so they do not have to turn their gold into food.\n\nOne week later, the gnomes are solemnly leaving the mine, carrying their gold and their worldly possessions with them. After they left, we mined some gold for ourselves, boarded up the mine until I could get a small mining company set up, took the Sun Shard, and headed back towards town.\n\nThat is the story about how Horace the Wizard when from Neutral Good to Lawful Neutral. I have heard stories about how people use their degrees in engineering and chemistry to do nifty things in D&amp;D, but I haven't heard a lot of stories that involve legal loopholes.\n\nI hope you enjoyed the story!",

Massive, metal pieces of the temple are floating off, hovering and shimmering from pure magical energy, and beginning to rotate. \n\n&gt;Look! They came from the temple! They are the heralds of the gods’ return!\n\nPeople cheer, people cry, people pray. Everything just kinda explodes as everyone drops what they're doing to see this event. (Gods are a *huge* deal here.)\n\nThen, they return to the duke, who grudgingly hands over the copious amounts of gold. However, he is grateful for making Arrakis a beacon of hope for the world -- literally.\n\n&gt;DM: “It is late at night, and you are extremely exhausted after your battles today. Would you like to rest? If you don’t, you’re fucking idiots.”\n\n&gt;DM: \"“In the morning, as you prepare to leave, you are approached by an old man.\"\n\n&gt;OM: \"Ello. Ye are the folk who entered the temple of the gods, no?\"\n\n&gt;Jodcus: \"Why, yes. Why do you ask?\"\n\n&gt;OM: “My lady would like to ave a tolk wit ye.”\n\n&gt;Slice: \"Your lady? Who is she?\"\n\n&gt;OM: \"She is my lady. That is all.\"\n\nHe leads them into the richer districts of the city, those close to the Duke’s palace. Eventually, they reach a simple wooden door, and the old man knocks on it. It slowly creaks open, revealing a grand entry hall.\n\nOM: “I present te ye, milady Ana.”\n\nHe gestures up, to a balcony above the floor of the entry hall. At the top of the stairs leading to the balcony stands an exquisitely dressed woman with dark hair and piercing orange eyes.\n\nAna: “Thank you, Charle. Come, adventurers. I would speak with you.”\n\nDM: “Ana leads you to a dining hall, the table absolutely filled with food. She slowly strides to the seat at the head of the table, taking her seat at a gold plated chair with red velvet cushioning.”\n\nAna: “Take a seat, please. And help yourselves to anything you see.\"\n\nShe takes a seat silently and lets the party eat, before speaking up.\n\nAna: “I have heard of your little expedition into the temple. Why, if I may ask?”\n\n&gt;Jodcus: “We were hired by the Duke to do so, in order to have a rallying point for the world.\"\n\n&gt;Ana: \"Well, of course. Leto has his motives. He always has. Well, you may find it hard to believe, but I support your little endeavour, and as the two nearest temples are across the oceans, you likely would prefer to sail on someone else’s coin rather than you own. What do you say?”\n\n&gt;Varion: \"Wait, what are your motives?\" he says, rolling for diplomacy.\n\nHe rolls a 26. She beats him.\n\n&gt;Ana: \"I have my reasons.\"\n\n&gt;Varion's Player: \"Really? With a 26 diplomacy???\"\n\n&gt;Jodcus' player: \"Well, she's probably an aristocrat. She has assloads of diplomacy.\"\n\n~~She's a level 15 (Eberron) Changeling Lich Sorcerer with Undetectable Alignment~~ She's an \"aristocrat.\"\n\nJodcus: \"We'll take your offer.\"\n\nAna: “Good decision. I look forwards to working with you. There is a galley on the docks, the Cry of the Trinity. Tell the captain ‘The Sun Sets in the Morning’.”\n\nThey buy shit then head off to the galley, where they meet a large man at the gangplank, staring at the party.\n\nM: \"Whaddya want?\"\n\nVarion: \"We are here to get on the boat.\"\n\nM: \"No one gets on without the boss' permission.\"\n\nVarion tries to get on the boat. The man punches him. He was a level 10 monk. It hurts.\n\nJodcus: \"Tell the captain 'The Sun Sets in the Morning.'\"\n\nM: \"BOSS! 'THE SUN SETS IN THE MORNING!\"\n\nDM: \"Out of the ship's cabin storms a purple-haired woman in a tricorn hat.\"\n\nC: \"Good gods, Odakota, do you want to be fired? Welcome to the Black Sea. We set off for Marakesh (the closest port city to the next temple) in an hour.\"\n\n*And so, they finish session four with a new goal and a new party member: Odakota.*\n\nThanks for reading!",

They were only level one and were generally using good tactics to advance room by room. After a tough battle in the penultimate chamber, the only enemy left was the Necromancer, who fled to his study. The group took a short rest to restore health and then slowly advanced on their foe.\n\nThe players were an odd mix - a ranger, two bards, a monk, and a fighter. The fighter decided to charge down the hallway, alone, in an attempt to whack the Necromancer with his maul - big mistake.\n\nThe Necromancer fire off a Magic Missile at 3rd level and knocked the fighter unconscious in one attack. Intimidated, the most of the party peppered the Necromancer with ranged attacks and dealt only minor damage. One bard used Vicious Mockery to successfully demoralize the Necromancer, giving him disadvantage for a round (roll two d20, take the lower).\n\nTo heal from his wounds, the Necromancer tried to use Vampiric Touch on the unconscious fighter. With disadvantage, he rolled two 20s. Critical hit.\n\nHigh damage rolls followed and the Necromancer sucks his life away. The fighter died and the Necromancer went up to full health. To add insult to injury, the Necromancer cast Animate Dead on the fallen fighter and he rose as a zombie minion.\n\nAn enraged party charged the Necromancer and quickly killed him. Without his influence, their friend turned zombie stood mindless and passive. They led him back to town with the hopes of finding a priest to revivify him. Ultimately, they decided the price was too high and let the priest put him to rest for good.",

        "text": "\"Ah,\" Fell says with a twisted smile, \"Preparing the treasure for my ship?  You're so kind.\"\n\n\"What's this about Fell?\" My Lord responds, distain evident in his voice as he spits Fell's name.\n\n\"A little birdie told me you was in a spot of bother.\"\n\nKlaus moves to the middle of the bridge, next to the holographic communicator.  \"Are you admitting to spying on me Fell?\"  Fell raises his finger as if to make a point, but instead pauses there, mouth agape, with nothing to say.  Even as a hologram, I see his face fluster as he retracts his finger into a clenched fist.\n\n\"Just look at where spying has got me Winters!\"  He stomps and throws his hands back like a tantruming child, his hair knocked loose as he himself starts to unravel.  \"It has brought me here!  Destiny has arranged it so I can destroy you on this day!\"\n\n\"Yes, well...\" my Lord looks at Fell as he eagerly awaits a response, but instead makes a beeline for the switch and cuts transmission.  The confused staff watch as their Captain leaps back over to the helm, grasping the wheel ready to jump.  \"Odette!\" He yells, in position.\n\nThe rest of the crew have little time to react, barely securing themselves as all necessary preparations have already been made.  Before Fell's weapons can charge we say goodbye to the marooned ghost ship the Righteous Path, ripping head first into the warp at full speed.\n\nOur ship twists and turns, Odette leading us through the darkness as our Captain steers on her mark.  The two of them are focused, flawlessly in sync, as we pass through places no ordinary pilot would dare to try.  I man the sensors, scanning for the ships Fell brought to intercept us.  They still follow, but we're gaining distance fast, their crew unable to match the sheer level of skill Odette and Klaus each possess, even with an easier to manoeuvre vessel.  Our escape seems assured.\n\nAfter a minute or so Odette goes silent.  My Lord attempts to call her in her tower; still nothing.  Perhaps I thought too soon.  I have only ever seen Odette take matters seriously on a handful of occasions, all of which were dire and perilous.  Her absence can only be a bad omen.\n\nJust as we send staff to check on her directly the ship jolts, ejecting itself from the warp.  Klaus, while off guard from the sudden expulsion, shifts his weight and quickly turns us about, making our entrance as comfortable as humanly possible.  We slide bumpily into an asteroid field, relying once again on our Captain's exceptional piloting technique to see us through.  He does so clutching the helm, spinning it rapidly, avoiding the debris and skidding us around one-eighty, facing our point of entry.\n\n\"Sorry about that sir,\" Odette reappears over vox, \"I had to make an emergency exit.\"  She pauses as the rest of us wait for her explanation.  \"Something was following us.\"  The terrifying seriousness in our Navigator's voice tells me she is not talking about Fell.  I can't recall her ever taking up this tone before.  This may be the most unsettling thing I've experienced all day.\n\nBut the day isn't over yet.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"  Klaus asks.\n\n\"I've heard the legends, but I didn't think they actually existed.\"  Odette continues, as I begin to scan our surroundings.  The three other ships are barrelling toward us, one by one exiting the warp, split up by the asteroid field.  As I take note of their positions, a forth entity forms on our radar.\n\n\"Something... big is living out there.\"  Odette stammers.\n\n\"...Odette, what *is* out there?\"  I urge her, my nerves rising as she leaves us in suspense.\n\n\"...a warp kraken.\"\n\nThe call goes silent for what feels like forever.\n\n\"Um...\"  Klaus clears his throat.  \"Sorry... what?\"\n\n\"A kraken sir!\" Odette repeats, \"You know, it's big and has tentacles -\"\n\n\"- aha, yes I know the stories Odette.\"  No one speaks up as Klaus appears to process this.  Catching us all unaware he pipes up again, only this time much louder.  \"With something like that in my trophy cabinet, I would be one of the greatest living Rogue Traders!\"\n\nI stare at the mass on the radar bigger than our ship, or any of the surrounding ones.  I'm not convinced that our Captain knows what is about to appear.\n\n\"Sir -\" Odette once again adopts an authoritative tone \"- I'd remind you that no one has ever actually killed one before.  There are only a handful of accounts even *escaping* these beasts.\"  \n\nIn a strange twist of events Odette silences our Captain.  I can only sit back and watch as it all unfolds, caught between utter panic and total bewilderment.  Klaus pulls himself together, instructing the Tech Priests to broadcast him over the entire ship.\n\n\"My crew - something large is coming for us out of the warp.  I intend to take its head.  If you don't want to join me in this noble victory, then you are free to flee.  Those who stay however, will be greatly rewarded.\"  Considering what the crew we have left has gone through today, I can't imagine any would leave now.  Together with those found upon the Righteous Path, our men prepare for war.\n\n[Start](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3dfr45/tales_from_a_seneschal_rogue_trader/) | [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3vnmi5/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_15/) | [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/406jtc/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_17/) | [Last](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/406jtc/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_17/)",

DnD, Shadowrun, NWoD, etc. But one game system I have memorized inside out, backwards, forwards, and blind is the **Star **Wars **RPG system from **West **End **Games. It's my bread an butter. Also, I have had my FRIENDS and I've had my GAMING FRIENDS.\n\nIt wasn't until last night that my FRIENDS tried GAMING.\n\nIt was beautiful, horrible, and hilarious.\n\nAllow me to set the stage for you:\n\n* A Zabrak smuggler/Space Cowboy named Malum Reynolds\n\n* A recently attained self-awareness constrution droid named Bonder.\n\n* A martial artist that recently discovered he was force sensitive named Ryu Muramasa\n\n* Two Farguls (Space Khajit) played by a dating couple, one's name was John Stamos, the other Mary Sue.\n\nAt this point I knew EXACTLY what kind of gaming session this was going to be.\n\nThey expressed interest that they actually want to do a Campaign but *I* insisted they go through a \"Tutorial\" adventure first. So I pull out my handy dandy 2nd Edition and turn to the 1 hour adventure titled \"The Pirates of Prexiar\". \n\nSide Note: Any idea out there on how to pronounce Prexiar? I've run this session about 10 times over the last 15 years and have never figured it out. \n\nAnyways. \n\nBack to the story.\n\nI lay out the rules: He who kills the cheer, buys the beer. Put up OOC if you absolutely have to, otherwise everything thing you say is IN CHARACTER. Good roleplaying trumps dice rolls out of combat, etc.\n\nYou know, the RULES.\n\nI tell them their mission (Get back the stolen supplies) and leave the room and allow them to prepare their assault for the next 5 minutes (If Malum Reynolds didn't buy a skill point in tactics I wouldn't have allowed this...). I go outside, smoke a death stick, come back in and they all look like they're FUCKING CLEVER AND SHIT.\n\nFor those that don't know The Pirates of Prexiar it's basically an isolated Pirate camp with an electrified fence all around with an entrance on one side and a river that runs into a retention pond on the opposite side.\n\nMary Sue declares she's going to attempt to bullshit the gate guard into letting her in to talk to the pirate leader while everyone else sneaks in the back way.\n\nMental Note: She's going to try and be the distraction...\n\nMary Sue: So Runnnerbrax, I walk right up to him and persuade him\n\nI roll a 12 and she rolls a 15\n\nMe: Ok, you barely won the roll, but now you have to really try and convince me (The GM).\n\nWhich she does SPLENDIDLY, but since she is who she is IRL, this doesn't surprise me. I make a mental note of something else she said in the speech challenge and file it away for later.\n\nWhile this is all happening, the space cat, space cowboy, asshole robot (Don't worry, he's water-proof), and Jedi low crawl through a shit smelling creek into a shit smelling retention pond.\n\nBut not before Malum Reynolds fails all of his rolls miserably and touches the fence while crawling though. Actually, he fails his damage resist roll so bad that he should have died (I found my bad dice thrower everyone!).\n\nI informed Captain Malum he only pissed himself.\n\nNow the cook of the base decides he needs more water for his shitty space beef soup and sends one of the roving patrols to get another bucket of shitty space water.\n\nMe: Everyones' rolled high enough to hide in the water. He doesn't see you guys when he bends oer to fill the buc...\n\nJohn Stamos: I reach up out of the water and snap his neck.\n\nHe rolls for a Very Easy surprise melee attack and rolls a THIRTY FUCKING SEVEN (His wild die kept landing on 6 which enables a re-roll).\n\nIt seems I've found the Player Character with the enchanted dice.\n\nNow, I don't know if you guys do this, but if one of my PCs rolls high enough on whatever they are doing in combat, I allow them to dictate the scene for the next 30 seconds.\n\nWhich I immediately regretted \n\nSaid friend is actually a pretty successful horror author.\n\nBy the way, my dice wizard is also my my murder-hobo...\n\nJohn Stamos murder-fucks another roving patrol, Bonder sneaks into the mechanics shop with the declared intention of looking for supplies. \n\nTo which I found the thief of my group. \n\nAnd Malum Reynolds BARELY sneaks onto the Pirate ship so he can commandeer it.\n\nBack to Mary Sue. She rolls for another  persuasion challenge. I keep this roll hidden. She fails miserably.\n\nMe: Dammit, you beat his roll again\n\nNPC: Ok, I'll take you to Vangar.\n\nThe gate guard knocks on the door.\n\nNPC: Soooo, Mary Sue right?\n\nMary Sue: Yeah.\n\nI secretly roll Perception for her, she fails.\n\nNPC: What was the name of the Space Commmunity College we had Space Philosophy together?\n\nMary Sue: Uhhh, wasn't it Space Blinn of Space College Station?\n\nHe levels his blaster at her\n\nNPC: Probably not, I'm a Space Longhorn...\n\nAaaaand SCENE",

For this, I decided to run them through a session my own players had gone through a few days earlier.  The following is a comparison between the two styles of play, and as such gets a bit long due to the dual nature of this tale.\n\n**My group:**\n\nThe party approaches a city near sunset, and as such go about finding a place to stay for the night.  This city is one that was indicated on a map they found in a dungeon and that they decided to follow.  As the party is exploring the city, they learn of an assassination plot involving a couple twins who are next in line for mayorship and one not wanting to share power.  The party is able to strike a deal with the chief lorekeeper of the city, who is also the sister of the twins, that if they keep the good brother from dying, she will grant them passage to the location in the city marked on the map.  \n\nThe ensuing investigation to get hard evidence includes a loan shark getting Batmaned by the fighter, the cleric spending 2 days in the library, and the creation of rocky-talkies^tm by a local arcanist.  Finally, the party finds the local brothel/assassination ring, the Sword and Sheath, where all the workers are \"multitalented\".   After finding the name of the assassin who will be taking the job, our bard sees his moment to shine and hires her for her more pleasurable services.  After passing an acrobatics check and a natural 20 on the constitution check, the bard has won her over, and he convinces her to take out the twin who wanted the assassination as opposed to the intended target.\n\nHaving technically completed their objective in preventing the death of the good brother, the party is granted access to the next part of their journey after 4 hours of play time and our longest session yet (because I still need to learn about making organic stopping points)\n\n**The Chucklefucks:**\n\nThe party consisted of Spencer as Orky Orkinson, Garrett as some legitimate assassin rogue type character, and Ego as Donald Trump on a mission to make America great again.  In an attempt to make things under similar conditions as my own party, Ego ended up with the [Jakkawab](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/32fqtc/dd_5edeadlands_hoe_the_consequences_of_playing/cqarjxw) and Garret holding the [Wabbajak](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2zun42/dd_5e_when_a_surprise_character_betrayal_failed/cpmy3i9), and each of them holding a single chaos potion.\n\nTrump, hoping to make his country great again, downs his potion instantly, causing him to turn into a wood elf - a tragedy for the racist caricature - and Orky throwing his at Trump not trusting the magical properties, and shuffling Trump's stats and landing him with a constitution score of 1 and a max hp of 11 at level 3 (this is important later).\n\nAs Donald enters his mid-life crisis, the party finally enters the city.  Garrett opts to sneak into a room instead of paying for one, with Orky and Trump sharing a room at a different inn.  Trump, wanting to start a bar fight to help distract him from his crisis, swings his dildo bat (it was a goof off session, so I allowed it) at the nearest patron.  \n\nNatural 1.\n\nThe dildo bat swings straight over the head of the intended target, and flops around to hit Trump in the face with its damage roll of a war hammer, dropping him to 1 hp.  Orky, wanting to stop the trouble before it starts, goes to grapple Trump.  Natural 20.  Orky decides to grapple Trump by picking him up by the balls, which knocks Trump to 0, knocking him unconscious.  Everybody goes to bed for the night.\n\nCome morning, Trump is overcome by grief and decides to fire the jakkawab at his dick. \"target disappears and is seen again two sessions later.\"  As far as he knows, it isn't coming back.  Fires Jakkawab at his head.  \"hedgehogs rain from the sky.\"  Orky then attempts to wrestle the Jakkawab from Trump, causing it to fire which resulted in Trump's arms to be possessed by a demon for an hour.  the actions of the arms result in Trump yet again falling unconscious.  Orky throws the Jakkawab out the window, not trusting it in the slightest.  As he does so, it fires once more.\n\n\"Portal to another universe of the DM's choosing opens in front of you\"\n\nSurprised and terrified, I go with the only logical answer.  The portal opens into the canonical world of my campaign. Orky goes through, dragging Trump with him.  There is now a dickless wood elf Donald Trump roaming the streets of my campaign along side Orky Orkinson, the Half-Orc barbarian (which my own players are unaware of unless they read this tale).  Thank the Mad God they didn't bring the Jakkawab with them or I'd have a mess to deal with.\n\nNotice how Garrett hasn't done anything yet?  That's because all this Chucklefuckery has happened in the span of about 15 minutes, if that.  Garrett takes the opportunity while Ego and Spencer are making new mem- I mean characters to actually get shit done.  Goes to the office of the chief lorekeeper, gains enough information to be able to forge a document of permission, and then bypasses the entire point of the plot.  This takes him about 10 minutes.\n\nFinally, Ego tells me he is now Boris the Soviet Love Hammer.  Since the plot is done, I allow this.  He finds the Jakkawab on the ground.  Luckily, he decides to not use it.  He then finds Yolanda the bar maid, Spencer's new character.  Yolanda would appear to be a man, were it not for her huge... tracts of land.  She is instantly infatuated, but Boris responds (in heavy Russian accent) with \"I prefer the cock\", after which Yolanda slaps him with a rooster that she pulled from thin air.  Fade to black, the bed and floor are broken.  After this, they go to find \"large hairy man\" and stumble upon Dio, the evil twin.  \n\n\"roll for threeway\"\n\nDio dies of a heart attack during fade to black.\n\nWith more detail and less time, the Chucklefucks accomplish the same and more than my own little shits did on their run of the session.  Bizarre? Yes, but business as usual for these Chucklefucks.\n\n\n",

        "text": "Sorry, this is long. This is my first time writing a story like this.\n\nAt the beginning, we were all level 1 and introducing ourselves. Because of my odd race choice ([My homebrewed acid slimeling.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/3xfpec/homebrew_slimeling_race_v2/)), my DM put me into the plot by having me be in the sewers where bodies where being dumped. The other players were a tiefling bard/traveling circus with no members, and a wood elf druid who loves fire. I'm also a barbarian.\n\nAfter a while and some rat fights, we manage to link wererats to the murders. (Actually, one player randomly suggested it as a joke, and the DM went with it.) We talk with a half-dragon who has a plan to deal with these rats, and that requires us going to an abandoned silver mine (possibly caused by griffons in the area) and getting silver for fighting wererats. Our bard also wants to capture a griffon for his circus (which he also recruits us for).\n\nAfter 3 days of travel, on which our druid befriends a boar which she accidentally kills it in the next day and I hug a bear to death on the third, we reach the mine. (Also an imp steals some of our food disguised as a raven.)\n\nWe scare off some bandits near the entrance and get attacked by some violet fungus inside, reaching level 2 and ending our first session. Also, no griffons in sight. After some exploring we find a dead end. Instead of taking another path, I feel the wall and it's an illusion! The tunnel continues and we find a very scared bird person. \n\nHe thinks we're with the bandits that apparently captured the rest of his people. We also find out they started a rumor that griffons are here, so there isn't any. Our bard (neutral alignment) after failing to calm him down, and finding out that there are too many bandits to deal with, decides to capture him for the circus anyway and just leaving. Closest thing to a griffon we got. We also forget the silver and decide to deal with it later. The bard also grabbed some glowing mushrooms.\n\nAfter returning to the town, the rat problem got worse; they started to attack people in daylight. We return to the half-dragon and the bard shows him our 'griffon' (who's tied up and not very happy) and rants how he sent us to a mine without tools, miners, etc. So of course we don't get paid, which our bard dislikes greatly. She then grinds up the mushrooms we got and pretends they're drugs, so she sells the fake drugs for gold. (I swear she's a rogue disguised as a bard.)\n\nEventually we go back to the sewers to find the source of the rat problem, which happens to be a very exclusive club. The way into the cellar/basement of this club from the sewer is too small for the bard to crawl into, but my sliminess and the druid's wildshape allows us in while the bard tries to gain a membership to the club and fails.\n\nThe druid and I are in the cellar and steal a little wine (I don't get drunk, but I turn from blue to light magenta), then a tall grey-haired man walks down the stairs. Druid wildshapes into a rat and hides, I freeze. After a little talk we find out the rats are his minions or something. I try to attack him (I grapple him with my sliminess) but he uses a dominate spell and forces me into a bottle. He can also talk telepathically and tells the druid to leave. She takes me back into the sewers and uncorks me, my character now afraid of bottles.\n\nWe meet up with the bard and she decides \"Fuck it, the rats have taken over. Burn the city down.\" So we do. I *WAS* neutral good but now I'm just neutral. They corrupted me. He throws molotovs into a library (he makes them with booze he bought with the drug money) and uses prestidigitation to start other fires around town. The druid uses produce flame to set more fires and we escape town. I assume we dealt with the rats, but I doubt the weird tall rat guy is dead. Also *possibly* killed many innocent lives, but they could've been wererats.\n\nThus ends our second session. We didn't reach level 3 sadly, and we ruined some of the DM's plans. Also the bard's equipment got stolen by the rat people and we're all broke.",

        "text": "I play in a kingdom-building campaign, and each player controls multiple PCs. My characters include the rulers: a paladin and a sorceress. My GM tasked some of the players to create a group of assassins which would target another character on the council. I decided that if I were to play an evil assassin, he may as well have a class requirement for it. So I decided on an antipaladin. The others formed a balanced party, and we joked how it was the antipaladin's harem, since he was the only male.\n\nWhen I started making him, I quickly ran into the first dilemma. Antipaladins gain immunity to the effects of disease, though they can still contract and spread them. In my interest of making a character that would actually be able to do his job, I asked the GM to give me as many diseases as possible. He gave me 8 diseases, and then I picked up Tetanus and Zombie Rot for free. \n\nMy paladin ruler was immune to disease, and my sorceress had an item that made her immune as well. But the day after I made this NPC, I realized that this would not go so well for our kingdom. Considering that the bubonic plague alone wiped out a third of Europe, and I had 9 more diseases on top of that, our kingdom was about to be well and truly shafted.\n\nWhen the assassination event happened, the assassins laid out their trap, which included most of our ruling council except for the targeted NPC. They drew us down into a cave with zombies, created a cave-in behind us, and filled the cave with smoke. It was surprisingly effective, and we wouldn't have made it out, except for our wizard magister's ability to teleport short distances without having to speak.\n\nThe antipaladin, meanwhile, had spread as much disease around as possible. The kingdom was going to be torn apart by disease.\n\nAnd then things turned out to be laughably easy. We had a genie-in-a-bottle that we could have used to make a wish, but our magister had discovered the true name of an angel outsider during some of his research, and this angel had unlimited Remove Disease. So this angel helped cure everyone before the diseases actually started killing people.\n\nThe assassins, having been thwarted, started escaping on a boat. We managed to find them with a Bird Feather Token, and caught them on the riverbank as they were leaving their getaway boat. The GM had our party in the river, except for the people who were flying (like my sorceress). The assassins were supposed to hit us with ranged attacks while we were swimming across, and then we would have a grand old throw-down on the shore. My sorceress specializes in compulsion spells, so she just hit them with an AoE Confusion. None of the assassins managed to make their saves, and they didn't do a single thing. The rest of the party made it across, and the assassins were just slaughtered. \n\nOur GM calculated that all of the diseases would be a high enough CR to bring all of the commoners who contracted them up to 3rd level. So we now have the most heroic populace of NPCs in the world.",

I played a ranger, my favorite class, with a wolf companion.\n\n&gt;She decided there would be no combat. Okay, fair enough, roleplaying sessions can be good. Heck, a noncombat campaign can work, too. Then she said we all had to be good aligned. Eh, we were all playing good or neutral characters anyway.\n\n&gt;Then we learned that we couldn't hunt for food. Sigh. That's what rangers do. Then we learned that all our characters were going to be vegan for the campaign. We asked if this was because of the laws. No, we were vegan because eating meat is a bad thing. Oh, and my wolf is uplifted and wise enough to be a vegan now.\n\n&gt;First session was nauseating. There was no conflict. We were just plunked down into a perfect vegan hippie commune with no direction. We had to make our own fun. I don't think she really understood that we needed some conflict. After some player feedback, we got an actual adventure. There were some people doing vague evil things, and it was threatening the commune.\n\n&gt;She left it up to us. I tried sneaking in to gather evidence of wrongdoing. It was described in exagerrated terms and sinister tones, but I learned that they were running a game farming operation. Essentially poaching, but on a large scale.\n\n&gt;Oh, and the runoff was polluting the drinking water. So we cracked some jokes about summoning Captain Planet. She was not happy about the comparisons, but it was something for us to do.\n\n&gt;The breaking point for me was that she threatened to deduct xp from my character if I brought snacks she disapproved of. She tried to coerce me into throwing out the chili I had brought for everyone, which had been preparing for no less than ten hours, then shame me for it, telling me that my character would never eat something like that.\n\n&gt;She was that kind of hippie. The kind that acts like they have your best interests at heart, but don't want you to be able to make choices they deem wrong.\n\n&gt;Anyway, up to the breaking point, we were bored. Sooo bored. The DM was annoyed that we were cracking jokes. Up to and including me playing dueling banjos and making Deliverance references. I reasoned, out loud, that everyone in the village had the same birth defect, so there must be some heavy inbreeding going on.\n\n&gt;The DM asked me what the hell I was talking about. \"Well, it's obvious they were all born with their heads up their asses. Must be a spinal defect.\" I don't rag on the setting or plot unless you are doing something very, very wrong.\n\n&gt;I try to be fair, but nobody was having fun. It just wasn't fun. ",

        "text": "[Gloop.](https://redd.it/3s63fz) [The party](http://imgur.com/X67Krv3) was marching through a swamp filled with crab-men and gloop. Why the hell were they doing this, when they could be doing so many other things? Well, the short answer was morals. They were escorting a caravan of reasonably-friendly drow, whose lives they had inadvertently ruined, and were trying to make amends by escorting them through hostile territory. And boy howdy, they needed it. Swamps are awful.\n\nBut nobody likes trudging through a damp muckland forever, so a plan was formed. Instead of just marching through the swamp as they had been, and encountering every damn monster from the manual on the way, they decided to expedite things by taking a shortcut. A \"shortcut\" which involved enchanting a bunch of caravans to levitate, and then flying them over the godawful place! What could go wrong?\n\nWell, as [Kai the wereshark titan](http://fav.me/d91by1o) and [Fish the goblin rogue](http://rakadishu.deviantart.com/art/Fisheye-571132531) discovered on their journey, quite a lot! They were attacked by hellish mosquito-things (smacked them around and set them on fire), a flock of harpies (smacked them around and threw nets at them), and some fucking hydras (filled their mouths with spiders). But finally they arrived at their destination, travelling hundreds of miles per hour, in the air, with no way to maneuver and no brakes. All in all it was insanely lucky that Kai still had a scroll of Soften Earth and Stone.\n\nAnd now, the party had one final hurdle to cross... that of going up. They were stuck in the underdark, like a large amount of other unfriendly creatures, and they were ready to go home. It's just that, in order to actually go home, they needed to take the proper path. And in this case, the proper path was an impossibly tall tower, called the Tower of Babil, which was completely and utterly STUFFED with Faeries. Prissy, uptight, capricious goddamn Faeries with the charm and grace of rabid lawyers, and the patience and kindness of spoiled toddlers. And the capstone on this cornucopia of NOPE was that Fish had been very kindly asked by an innocent five-year-old spider girl not to hurt any of the fuckers.\n\nThe party snuck their way in, desperately hoping that their journey up would be easy. It was totally not. On the first floor alone, they were groped, shaken down for bribes, nearly drowned in a river, hunted by assassins, struck by lightning, nearly eaten by some sort of fungus-monster, and about a dozen other things. Fucking Faeries. About the only good part of the situation was running into [a really chill guy named Haem](http://fav.me/d9ht420), who wasn't interested in much other than partying. Cool dude, gave them a place to crash and a few pointers for where to go.\n\nThe next floor, and who do they run into but Haem! The party, well, partied for a bit and relaxed after the mad dash they had just endured, and planned their route. And the whole Faery world rigamarole started up anew, but this time with boiling swamps, scorching deserts, and fire tornadoes. They made a mad dash for the portal to the next floor, while being pursued by lizard-men, some sort of creature made entirely of holy fire, and a six-legged swamp monster that breathed lightning. And who's waiting on the other side? Fucking Haem.\n\nSeriously, that dude was, like, everywhere. He knew everyone, could get anyplace, and could get \"the choicest shit\" on a moment's notice. And apparently he had nothing better to do than follow the party around, give them advice, take them to sweet gigs, and talk up how cool things were in Faeryland. Well, the party wasn't really having it, so they set off on the next leg of their journey. This time around, they had wonderful adventures involving arguing over the price of some booze at swordpoint, travelling through an incredibly creepy pumpkin patch, getting into an argument with a scarecrow, and learning a bit of the history of the place while dicking around in a graveyard. And then, when they found the next portal, they were forcibly escorted through by [some godawful horse-man-plague-monster-thing](http://orig04.deviantart.net/595b/f/2013/186/5/3/53ff9a822a665d8d21989e45bdd7d229-d6c2uhx.jpg).\n\nAnd guess who was on the other side! Motherfucking Haem the jolly stoner.\n\nThings were different this time around, though. The whole way up the tower, the spacey bastard had been talking up the wonders of the Faery lands, offering places to stay, and generally warning the party away from the whole \"leaving\" thing. And, of course, he had a damn good reason. The party, by now, knew a LOT about the tower. Its history, its significance, its location, and most importantly, how to kill every goddamn thing inside. See, Kai and Fish were carrying a LOT of iron, and if it wasn't for their incredibly admirable caution and restraint, they easily could have carved swathes of death and destruction through the place. And any fucker with combat sense and some handy iron could do the same, and there was fuck-all that the Faeries could do to stop them.\n\nWell, not quite true. The faeries had a secret weapon- Haem. A reasonable, caring, and affable guy who just wanted everyone to chill and do their own thing. And, oh yeah, the most powerful druid in all of Faery. This guy sat the party down around a nice big campfire, and had a serious discussion with the party about their travels, and what they knew, and how they couldn't be allowed to leave knowing what they did. And if they didn't come to an agreement, every godawful monster in all of the Faery-infested tower would be on their asses.\n\nThe party extremely reluctantly agreed to an unconventional solution- they would have their memories altered. All the stuff they knew about the tower, and the Faeries, and even the drow (who were technically faeries) would be edited out of the party's memory and replaced with some bullshit story about finding the magical macguffin crystal and teleporting out of the godsforsaken underdark. Fish in particular was not happy about this arrangement, having spent a lot of time connecting with a certain insufferably cute spider girl, whom he would forget after the memory alteration.\n\nThere was a lot of waffling, heartfelt arguments, and a tearful goodbye, but they went through with it. They got the alterations and were booted out the door, into some fresh surface snow in a lovely winter forest. Finally, FINALLY out of the underdark!\n\nSo naturally they were immediately assaulted by a pack of Dire Bears and some strangely plants. It's just that kind of campaign.",

        "text": "So me and my friends just started a game of shadowrun and this was our second game.  I figured with Christmas right around the corner,  I might as well run a seasonal session just for fun. \n\nA brief introduction to characters:\n\nWan: Wan is quite the character.  A pixie who was born with essentially no magic,  and so decided to become a decker. He has a very noticeable trait: his wings.  Whenever he gets aroused,  a bright pink glow Emirates from his wings.  Beyond that he is the typical decker: squishy,  not very fight,  but good with a deck.  However unlike most,  he is pretty dumb in everything other than computers. \n\nNadia: Nadia is a druid mystic adept who is very charismatic,  but also stealthy.  She is the face of the group,  as well as the stealthiest,  with a knack for acrobatics. She is quite a pacifist with a love for animals and tries her best to do no harm...  Unless it means getting paid. \n\nVivi: a happy go lucky technomancer,  Vivi decides to maintain a positive outlook on life to compensate for her dark line of work.  She's also good with a sword or 2.\n\nHappy (NPC): he's a troll.  He's the muscle.  Need I say more? \n\nOnto the story. \n\nSo it started like every other run. It's late in December and vivi gets an anonymous phone call saying someone had a job for her. They were told they were to help disrupt a competitor's shipment however they like,  be it explosions or simply rerouting,  and report back to their local watering hole to collect pay. Should be a milk run.  \n\nSo Vivi gathers a team and they set out to do their legwork.  They find the factory where the shipments sounds be leaving from that night.  They decide to hack in to the system to get a little more info than the public grid would give up.  In their research they find out this company,  The Emotional Levity Force (hey,  I like giving some clues...  ELF....yeah anyway.)  manufactures a lot of household goods,  but seems to make write quite a few toys as well.  \n\nAfter talking to a local toy store owner,  Nadia learns that quite a few of the local toys come from this manufacturer. \n\nThey do the rest of their leg work and get the standard stuff like security details etc. \nIt's now,  unbeknownst to the runners,  the night of December 24th,  and the shipment is supposed to leave at 00:01 of the 25th. They have to do the run now or risk not making it in time. \n\nThe first thing Vivi does is trigger an alarm outside back of the factory.  After this,  they walk in through the front door of the factory where two gnome security guards they saw on the security cameras are chatting.  Vivi immediately orders Happy to take care of them.  Happy takes Nadia's silenced gun, as he lacks his own,  and makes short work of one guard while the other sustains a heavy shoulder wound.  Nadia begrudgingly finishes off the second guard- blood staining both the guards green suit,  and the wall.  In the mean time Happy went and opened one of the packages ready for shipment and finds kids toys inside.  \n\nNoticing on the security cameras that there are two guards blocking a door upstairs that didn't respond to the alarm,  Vivi figures the server with the shipment data is in that room.  The party decides to go upstairs and on the way there,  Nadia notices a truck one truck in the fleet had a bright red light on the front. Once in the hallway upstairs,  Wan pops around the corner and immediately fire non-metal stick-n-shock rounds at one of the guards,  and then,  seeing as that didn't down him,  shoots him with his actual handgun.  The other guard fires back and Wan spends a point of edge to avoid what was certain death if he got hit.  \n\nThe team joins in the fight,  Vivi kills the injured guard with her swords,  and then the remaining guard begs for mercy.  He grants them access to the room and safe escape to spare the life of him and the remaining guards out back.  The team agrees. \n\nOnce in the server room Vivi edits the shipping destination,  sending 1/3of the toys to an orphanage,  and the other 2/3 are offset by 1 street number. \n\nThey escape safely as the guard promised and went to collect their pay.  Their Johnson rolls up in a bright green Mitsubishi Nightsky and hands them a cred stick and says thanks for the successful run.  \n\nThe city wake up the next day to find none of the toys that they ordered for their children have arrived,  and instead their neighbor seems to have got what they ordered.  In the Barrens,  this causes some brawls,  while in the city,  most were just generally unhappy on Christmas morning. \n\nAnd that is how my runners missed some subtle clues,  ruined Christmas, and got paid to work for George Rinch,  or G. Rinch for short.",

        "text": "**Members**\n\n* Alli the centaur\n* Ash Greyborn, Genasi Ranger\n* Gylian, Goliath Paladin\n* Herb, Elven Druid\n* Misdir, Elven Ranger  \n\n**Timeline**\n\nDays 11 &amp; 12\n\n**The Adventure**\n\nWe begin our session on the evening of the third day in the desert. After checking supplies, the party finds some of the water and food tainted. Something from the sewers caused it to rot, leaving them with only one day's worth of food and water. They also look down at their worn shoes, and realize that adventuring is hard on their equipment.  \n\nAfter preparing camp and settling in for the night, the party heard a battle cry, “Woop! Woop! Woop!”, and a centaur rode through the center of their camp. Ash was on guard duty and quickly woke the others. The centaurs were young and trying to count coup. Opening themselves to attacks of opportunity, they were running through the camp, trying to show off their prowess.  \n\nFinally, Gylian moved toward the biggest one, and was hit from behind. As he fell to the dirt, the apparent leader called off the 'assault'. The leader introduces himself as Gildemane. The party elects to follow the centaurs back to their camp and stock up on provisions. Along the way, a young female centaur named Alli decided to join the party for the rest of their journey.  \n\nThe centaurs went ahead to prepare and Alli stayed behind to guide the party. On the way, the party encountered a hive of ankhegs. Everyone noticed the ground rumbling just before they appeared, and managed to get out of the way. Ash dropped a Spike Growth in their path, as everyone jumped to safety.  \n\nAlli, got the first hit with her bow, and then Gylian blasted one with a Divine Smite, getting the first kill. At this point, Herb finally woke up and made a run for safety. He lit his pipe, taking a good drag, and checked out the situation.  \n\nThe ankhegs attacked. First Misdir and Alli got splashed with acid, and then Herb gets grappled. Gylian stepped in and went face to face with the closest one, and put it down. Alli killed the one holding Herb and he managed to roll out before getting splashed with acid.  \n\nThe party finally made it to the camp, Gildemane traded some hand made obsidian arrowheads for some javelin shafts. The party ate some boiled oats and drank the centaur's beer.  \n\nThe following morning, the party noticed a pair of giant eagles on the horizon. After some discussion, they decide to give the eggs back to the eagles, and in return, the party is gifted three Feather Whistles. Ash almost has the eagles convinced to fly them to Hurim, but in the end, the party walks the distance. Walking around a hive of giant ants and other insects, the party finally sees something on the horizon.  \n\nThere is a small tent town. Heading straight in, they find a large tavern tent, named Kensin's Inn. The leader, Alakar the Silent, greets them. As they enter, they notice a small cage with a Kender in it. Somehow Rowan beat them to the compound. Alakar explains that for some mysterious reason, the camp's children started disappearing just as Rowan showed up.  \n\nRowan explains that he ran the whole way after finding a 'Bag of Holding' for the party. He had wanted to apologize for his earlier actions, and though getting this obviously magic item to the would help. He was reluctant at first, but the party forced more information from him. It turns out that this is an 'endless' bag of holding, as in anything you put in never comes out.  \n\nThe party wastes no time and jumps completely in the bag, where they are teleported to the Lair of Krampus! The first thing they notice is that it is cold and dark. Hearing some children's voices, the party headed south. Before they could turn back, they were all hit by a strange magic cauldron. Herb was instantly chilled to the bone, and Alli got changed into a toad. Leaving that room, Misdir missteped and slid down a southern passage. The party followed, but were not in time to stop Misdir from falling off a 200 foot cliff. It nearly killed him. Unconscious and at the bottom of the cliff, the rest of the party scrambled to save him.  \n\nThe spider saved the day and fed Misdir a goodberry, and someone threw a healing potion down to him. While the party was helping Misdir up, Ash made his way up the ice chute and back to the storage room off in a side passage. He found a cache of goblin supplies there and burned them all.  \n\nGibbering mouther colored by redmonkey da-d3ijxru\nMoving south, Ally stepped on some thin ice and fell into a ten food pit. As soon as the ice broke, a strange cacophony of voices flooded out. Alli was soon engulfed by a Gibbering mouther. In her toad form, she couldn't do much, but that problem was soon solved, as the toad died and she reverted back to her natural form. Misdir stepped up to fight, but slipped and almost went in as well. Gylian managed to catch him by the scruff of his shirt.  \n\nGylian jumped in to help Alli, but misjudged his attack and hit his head. His next swing hit Alli. Herb, after transforming out of his own toad shape, struck the killing blow. Moving more cautiously, the party heard the yapping of goblins.  \n\nIt was an easy fight, but in the melee, Alli hit and killed a child. Gylian was able to save him by laying on hands.  \n\n\nMoving south, the party heard the lively sound of pan pipes. Moving in that direction, they came upon a band of satyrs and dryads. Ash was the first to fall to the effects of their potent wine, and went off with a satyr to look over his icicle collection.  \nThe party was for the winter solstice. The dryads and satyrs partied late into the night and all manner of fun was had.\n\n**XP**\n8350 for the session\n\n1670 each\n\n(Total campaign XP per person: 4,768)\n\nCurrent level: 4\n\n**Loot**\n15 obsidian arrow heads\n\n3 Feather Whistles\n\nBag of krampus",

        "text": "Hello everyone, my friends and I all started our first tabletop campaign ever with D&amp;D 5ed. Things have been crazy, and I wanted to share a few highlights/character bios even though I’m not sure this is the right place. I might post more if anyone seems interested. Excuse any bad formatting.\n\n First a little background. Our first couple of sessions didn't go so well, such as when the beginning tavern scene devolved into a total bar room brawl over the the course of 2 minutes (hence the title). There was no plot, the original DM couldn’t come up with a reason for our characters to work together so had them strapped with proximity bomb collars, and by the end of 2 sessions the entire continent was overrun by wendigoes with absolutely nothing we could do about it. After that the DM gave the DM position to one of our players. Our new DM decided to run a canned adventure so there would actually be plot. With that out of the way, here is our dysfunctional party.\n\n•\t**Blank:** Lawful Good Human warrior. A skilled swordsman who originated from a Northern Kingdom that fell into enemy hands. His player couldn’t think of a name so literally named him blank. Presumed dead 2 sessions into the campaign after the continent fell to Wendigoes. His player went on to play Alton.\n\n•\t**Heywood Jabloughmii:** A dragonborn dragon sorcerer who can best be described as aligned to himself. A sex crazed dragon sorcerer who specialized in intimidating everything that dared oppose him. Was hated by an entire camp of Sky Pirates of the Trees for sleeping with their wives, daughters, and mothers. Betrayed us 2 sessions into the campaign. His player eventually became the DM, and does so surprisingly well.\n\n•\t**Alton Thorngage:** Chaotic Good Light Foot Rogue Assassin. The second character Blank’s player made. He seeks vengeance on the noble that killed his wife. Met the party fleeing from wendigoes in the forest. Possibly the only sane man in the group, which isn’t saying much. He infiltrated a cultist camp and freed all their captives by cutting leg holes in a backpack and sneaking around in it. Due to his small stature, he has been physically tossed by Kragon and Lyria 3 times into danger when they were tired of waiting for the party to make a decision. He likes to sneak up on enemies, stab them repetitively, and then run away. His player is trying to think of some way to raise an army of chickens to distract enemies so he can sneak up on them easier. Currently trying to block out the bellowing shouts of an angry Drow.\n\n\n•\t**Lyria Dawnrose:** Chaotic Neutral Half-Elven Ranger. Last surviving member of her village that was burned to the ground. Holds her own interests above all else, but tries to accomplish them in a calculated matter most times. The only reason she is probably still with the party is her determination to get to know the Drow party member since she has never seen one. One of the 2 surviving original party. Current achievements include missing nearly every shot she took with a bow during the first half of the campaign, lassoing a giant spider boss down from some trees, recruiting a forest guardian named Sylf as a pet, and shooting explosive arrows at anything that manages to dodge her regular ones.  Believes the rest of the party besides Corvo is incompetent or crazy. Currently keeping watch over an angry Corvo after she had to knock him unconscious and tie him up.\n\n•\t**Corvo Nightgale:** Chaotic Good Drow Arcane Trickster. After becoming the enemy of Lolth’s high priestess he has been banished from the Underdark. After escaping to the surface world, he had to steal to survive leaving him with a bad case of kleptomania. Is ignorant of most of the customs and beliefs of the surface, and is enraptured by any animal he has never seen before. Came into possession a horse named Entei, which he believes is the most majestic creature in existence. Has a verbal tick of renaming objects, such as calling all short swords “really long daggers”. On friendly terms with the party excluding Aliella and Naill. Is the party’s eyes when traversing dungeons and has avoided every trap to date. Preferred method of fighting is charging a specially made sword with shocking grasp and electro-stabbing things.  His character seems to alternate between having amazing luck and abysmal luck every session. Currently tied up after going into a rage over forgetting Entei at the last stable we stopped at.\n\n\n•\t**Fredrick Robert Orwell:** Chaotic Good Human Lore Bard. Originally from our world, Fredrick somehow was transported to the Carthonai Bard College. The eccentric head of the college believed his story about being from another world and trained him as a bard. Now he is secretly trying to find a way back home by using his bard training and applying fantasy tropes to everything he sees. One of the 2 surviving original party. Has been relegated to part time tank due to having Defensive Duelist to add his weapon proficiency to his armor class. Escapades include: being forced to duel a half dragon mini boss at level 1 since no one else thought they would survive, mocking 2 enemies to death, temporarily going stark raving mad after failing an intelligence check against eldritch sheet music, finding out said sheet music apparently lets people contact the Fey Lords, and accidentally hypnotizing Corvo into throwing all his gold away with a possibly cursed harmonica. Currently wondering whether contacting the Fey Lords for a favor would just get the entire party killed.\n\n•\t**Aliella Carterhorn:** A Chaotic Good Half-Elven Dragon Sorceress. A happy go lucky person that just so happens to have invasive, bloodthirsty draconic voices in her head. At times she blanks out and attacks anyone who has made her mad with no memory of the event afterwards. When rolling up her backstory she found she is supposed to face an evil that only she can defeat. Has a luck dragon familiar and loves all living creatures except when she goes mad and wants them all dead. The parties best dedicated caster, has used her magic to get the party out of tight spots both in and out of combat. At the same time she is possibly the parties biggest threat depending on her mood, having tried to set Kragon’s face on fire as well as abandoning a battle to talk to some dragon eggs. She is currently skipping merrily through the ashes of 5 lizardmen she fried with a lightning bolt.\n\n\n•\t**Naill Immeral:** A “True Neutral” High Elven Wizard. Snuck up on the party out of the blue with no one noticing and claimed he had always been there. Seeks to make up for his forgettable personality and appearance by becoming a powerful necromancer. Does basically whatever he wants whenever he wants to keep things “neutral”. Has attempted to charm basically everything the party has encountered that has 2 legs. In his boredom he has launched a firebolt into the sky above a cultist camp we were sneaking into, physically flung himself into a dragon pit to make a flashy entrance, and fails so spectacularly at to hit rolls he has spent the campaign summoning/raising/charming creatures so that he has never had to directly kill something. Currently sitting bored in a canoe.\n\n•\t**Kragon:** A Lawful Neutral Human Barbarian. Originally an enemy Naill charmed in battle something went wrong and residual traces of the charm permanently stuck with him. He now travels with the party both because he is uncontrollably drawn to Naill and he hopes that if Naill died it will break the “curse”. This was the DM’s way of introducing him after the player had lost the character sheet he made 3 sessions in a row. Is the party’s angry tank, with incredible luck with rolling natural twenties. Achievements include: killing most mooks he fight against in one hit, getting into a bar brawl with a NPC berserker that lasted 2 real life hours, realizing he was terrified of the dark when we had to explore a tunnel, and attempting to drink himself into oblivion whenever possible. Currently trying to interrogate two lizardmen that don’t speak the same language he does by beating them and screaming.\n",

        "text": "Or rather, someone who could do a perfect impersonation of Obama. So this was about six or so months after GTA Online was released. A hacker had given me millions of dollars, I wasn't a hacker but I wasn't complaining. \n\n [Here is a map for reference](http://i.imgur.com/2IIz6nP.jpg)\n\n I was cruising around Rockford looking for something to do when I hear Obama, so I plug in my mic and start chatting with him and get an idea. So I send him a private message asking him if he is up for it and he was. So I bought the GTA equivalent of a Rolls Royce, upgraded it as much as I could and met up with Obama at Vinewood. We then put bounties of 9000 dollars on eachother (Highest bounty you can put on someone) and get ready.\n\n&gt; Where to Mr. President?!\n\n&gt; The airport please!\n\nIt's also worth noting, I was barely starting puberty, I was a squeaker, so just picture Alvin the chipmunk chilling with Obama.\n\nSo we head south from Vinewood, going Downtown when one of the people with the sports car is right on our tail.\n\n&gt; Do you have any sticky bombs?\n\n&gt; Haha watch this!\n\nObama throws a sticky bomb forward, instead of behind us. Before I can ask what he's doing, I go into a narrow gap between two busses. The guy in the car hits one of the busses and it EXPLODES! \n\n&gt; Get Rekt!\n\nIt scared the shit out of me and I steer us into a pole, an invincible one, unfortunately. Our engine is smoking but we are otherwise good. Hearing Obama say 'Get Rekt' was awesome by the way. \n\nThe rest of the way to the airport was uneventful, and we head to where the private jets are, get out and run to the jets. We get to a jet and start taking off.\n\nWe get into the air when I hear\n\n&gt; Uh Oh\n\nAnd Obama bails. Then another plane crashes into me, luckily only taking out my wing, rather than just exploding. I start spiraling down, so I bail and tell Obama to head to the helicopters. I land and run to the helicopters and there is another Buzzard, I get in, pick up Obama and start heading north towards [Blaine County](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gtawiki/images/e/e8/Mapp2.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140131040136). \n\nRight when we are about to reach the Alamo Sea the one in the other Buzzard starts shooting at us. I turn around and start flying backwards while shooting at her. Unfortunately my engine shut down and we just plummet towards the Alamo. We land smack dab in the middle and start swimming north. But then we are crushed by the other Buzzard. I took out her engine too, but I didn't notice. \n\nSo we respawn and start wondering what to do next, but then the rockstar servers all went to shit and we were booted back to singleplayer, but not before I sent him a friends request. And we proceeded to never play another game together again.",

One of questionable allegiance as well. His abilities stemmed from a cursed dagger he carried with him at all times. At any time he could summon several ethereal warrior whom he had killed and stored their souls in the dagger. They were powerful summons but they had one insanely obvious weakness, they could be banished back to the dagger in one hit. Their purpose was not combat but rather misdirection and illusion. My Necromancer excelled in close combat and pissing pretty much everyone off.\n\n\nOne day after going on a killing spree for no particular reason. The rest of the party got fed up and caught the bastard deciding to throw him into prison and let him rot so they could finish the campaign unhindered.\n\n\nThat is until I found out that the GM really enjoyed my character. \n\n\nA few days later the BBEG pays a visit to the Necromancer and offers him a sweet ass deal, get possessed by one of his seven powerful Knights, each an embodiment of one of the seven deadly sins. However because the Necromancer is just that special kind of dick, he refuses and instead provides a counter offer.\n\nSacrifice his own soul, gluttony's soul, and every soul the Necromancer had ever taken in order to punch a hole in reality and pull the nothingness from beyond creation and have it possess a body.\n\n\nGM says that's cool.\n\n\nGM plans for the rest of the campaign to focus around her original BBEG while my newly created Void God ravages the rest of the world in order to set the party up for a sequel in the future. And while that happens my Necromancer and the sin of gluttony retire to hell to a cottage on a flaming lake. Providing the only comic relief for the rest of the campaign.\n\n\nGood times.",

I'd love to listen to them while at work or in the car, but my own searching has turned up little (I found one recording for part of the Old Man Henderson story on someones SoundCloud, and that's about it). I figured there has to be someone, what with how popular Creepy Pasta reading is, why not read these kinds of stories? So if anyone knows of anything I'd love to check them out for myself.\n\nEdit: They don't need to be Youtube, that was just where I started my search. Also, I hope I used the right flair for this.",

        "text": "I'm normally the GM for my group,  but one of my players wanted to give GMing a try, so we let him. Turns out he's pretty good; he made a homebrew setting with decent lore in about three days, and some pretty unique races. There are lizard-people, so I decided to make a small rogue and call him a kobold in my head. He plans heists on the higher-class mages in the world (who are almost universally diabolists of the sacrificing-virgins, calling-deep-dark-powers-from-hell-with-the-blood-of-innocents kind of people,) and fucked up a heist some time in the past. Present day, he's lacking all the fingers on his left hand except the index finger and thumb, and he's lacking his... er, manly bits.\n\nBackstory time. The party arrived in a major city separately. For some reason, a lot of people have been migrating here and we don't know why, so we followed the mass exodus of bodies to the city and now we're dicking around here. I found a dilapidated chapel and set up shop in the disused bell tower, while the shaman went around looking to ~~whore~~ hire himself out. The spear-fighter joined the city guard, seeing it as a good opportunity to learn about the city quickly. The golem was already a part of the city guard (and only has elemental blasters for hands; commence Mega Man jokes out the ass).\n\nDuring my exploits, I see a rather large healing center called the White Cross (originality for the win). I head over there, and realize that people are getting treated for everything from paper cuts to dismembering, and get an idea.\n\nI catch a (normal-sized rat) and wring out its blood and viscera all over me. I even tear off a bit of my cloak and wrap it around my hand to play up the \"fingers chopped off\" bit. I then run around the White Cross, screaming bloody murder about giant rats.\n\nAt first, people are terrified, but after realizing that there are almost no rats around, the nurses and doctors begin to think that I'm mentally insane and eventually \"convince\" me to get inside a padded cell with only a mattress and a flimsy desk.\n\nI'm rubbing my hands together with glee. All going according to plan.\n\nAs soon as the door locks behind me, I throw the mattress up against the cell door and start stuffing my weapons/valuables into it, making sure that it isn't obvious that two daggers, twenty lockpicks, two torques, a belt with fake jewels embedded in it, a very, very nice diamond ring, and various maps and plans are secreted inside. Once that's done, I put the mattress back down and wait for nightfall.\n\nThe staff leaves at about 11 PM, so I get up from a small nap and begin to leave my room. In case everyone hasn't actually left yet, I'm only taking one lockpick out and using my index finger's claw as torque on the lock. I roll Disable Device.\n\n5.\n\nThe GM hand-waves (ha) as \"I accidentally slammed the stumps of my fingers into the door and recoiled in pain.\" I sigh and roll again.\n\n5.\n\nI'm rather miffed. I'm a thief; regardless of deformations, I should be doing better than this. The GM says my pick breaks, so I slip the now-useless scrap of metal into my pocket and grab another pick. Roll DD again.\n\n9.\n\nI realize that the lock is a rather special one. It's got three tumblers, but one is at a right angle to the others and has a different spring. I grab a few more picks, and roll a few more times. A summary:\n\n5, 6, 5, 12, 5.\n\nI'm now reasonably sure the GM is loading my dice. After THREE HOURS at this goddamned door, I manage to open the lock and make acquiring a key my first priority. I did eventually get one after a solid hour and a half of panicking because the door locked behind me.\n\nAnyways, now I have a free bed, and as long as locks don't give me that kind of trouble again (read: as long as the GM stops LOADING MY FUCKING DICE) I should be able to progress with Phase Two of my plans.\n\nTL;DR - Rogue forgot how to rogue.\n\nEDIT: I know the GM's not actually loading my dice, but that's now a decently solid running joke in our group. For added hilarity, whenever I'm with this group of people IRL I've begun cringing at doors, and outright screaming bloody murder if they're locked. Gotten some odd looks, but it's worth it.",

I of course panic and draw my dagger and flames spell. I start fighting back and he just keeps wailing on me. I finally beat him and realize something, I took no damage in that fight at all. So I quick check 3rd person and my body isn't there. I go back to first person, two floating lizard hands. Back to 3rd, nothing. I try attacking in 3rd and here a thud in the room behind me. I quick run back ands see my body jammed half way in the table flailing as it tries to do a walk animation.\n\nI begin shooting fire out of my hands and my character model starts flipping out launching fire everywhere as its hit box and the table's battle for the space. The camera was no longer locked to my model so I had free range to wander around the 2nd floor. After laughing for a while I take advantage of this to level up my stats by farming some mercenaries in first person because I am untouchable flaming lizard hands.

He was way too intent on making us experience **his** story than letting us play. We only got through 2 encounters in a 7 hour play through because if we weren't following his written path we \"couldn't do that here.\" Okay Professor Oak! \n\nLittle back story on my friend he had wanted to DM for quite some time so we gave him a month to prepare. He likes writting fanfics also so when he was told he could make the story for one session he went nuts. When he shows up he has a 100% filled 80 page notebook note book with 30 pages devoted to preplanned encounters (your dming one session dude.), 20 pages of random npcs(okay I guess), and the last 30 were devoted to tragic backstories of everything and how we had to fix them all (Hhhhm no).\n\nTake our first encounter for example. We see two figures on the road side standing over a dead person. So we all of course go to investigate. The two characters are hooded, silent, and have matching scars over each eye (2edgy4me). So my group begins questioning them while I investigate the body. Apparently even though I'm a healer, I can't find the cause of death even though I succeed my rolls. Really man? I succeeded my let me know the what I'm investigating.\n\nAnyways back to the hooded characters. They're being shady and a small idea passes my mind, I'm dragonborn wonder if they know dragconic? \"I speak to them in my native tongue.\" My friend gets a worried look and says, \"why do you do that.\" \"Because I want to.\" \"Well I don't think they'll understand you.\" Ten minutes of him saying no later, \"Fine have it your way.\"\n\nInshort stuff goes down and one of my hot headed companions get into a physical altercation with one and ends up getting turned to stone. So I being the lawful good person I am I charge amd swing at them both and the first thing my DM says is \"Why?\" \"The fuck do you mean why, Argnog is stone and could be dead!\" \"They were just pulling a prank.\" \"How are our characters supposed to know that?\" \"You could have asked?\" \"You haven't been answering any of our questions for the last hour and a half! So I bring my mace of disruption down on their skulls!\" Initiate the most boring one sided combat of my life. I'm desperately trying to fight off two crazed travelers while the DM keeps pullin ex machinas for them. I swing, hit them, \"They have extra armor under their cloaks.\" Okay then. I swing again, pierce their armor, \"your mace bounces off them\" WHY! This goes on for about an hour.\n\nNeedless to say after all this is said and done It turns out they were dragons in human form and that the dead guy died of \"poison or something.\"(The DM forgot why he died). If the DM had let me do what I had wanted a 3 hour long encounter would have take about 15 minutes. I fell asleep halfway through our next encounter because it was boring as sin and the DM was trying to make us do what he wanted. Everything ended with one of my friends stone, another trapped in a mirror, and my character sleeping at the inn because I fell asleep.\n\nTl;dr don't let your friend that thinks his terrible fanfics are cool DM because he will try turning your game into one.",

He admires his horns for a second before head butting the glass, bouncing off and stunning himself for a minute.\n\nThe sorcerer see this, decides to grab the barbarian's hand axe and takes a swing. Another 1. He drops the axe on his foot, narrowly avoiding losing a toe.\n\nThe rogue sighs deeply, steps over the sorcerer and barbarian and presses a finger up against the glass. \n\nNatural. Effing. 20. \n\nThe mirror cracks along the points where the party previously attempted to break it before shattering into a rain of glass shards that slash the barbarian up pretty good.

        "text": "Hey guys, first time poster, just discovered this subreddit a week ago. Just wanted to share an especially silly thing I did a few months ago.\n\nSo, let's cut right to the chase, shall we? First off: the setting: American soldiers are invading Canada because reasons, something similar to how it happens in Fallout universe. Ontario had been pretty much taken over, and our characters are still stuck Toronto. We have to get out of there and join the resistance fighters up North. \n\nSide note: I say \"our characters\" but at this moment in the campaign it was solo because the other guys weren't around.\n\nNext up, the cast:\n\n1. Dermock, a gnoll with ties to the Canadian military. Is probably edgy as fuck seeing as he doesn't talk much and owns a katana.\n1. Abdul ibn al-Hussein Mohammed, a human field medic that sort of appeared out of nowhere and decided to follow the Gnoll. He's a PC played by the GM, who tends to stereotype *just a bit.*\n\nSo Dermock had just barely survived combat against a bunch of soldiers in a mall's parking lot. He had been lucky enough to have \nAbdul show up during the firefight and hastily patch up some grievous wounds afterwards - after all, they didn't exactly have a lot of time before the main invasion force showed up. Dermock decided, though, that they had just enough time to search through the mall for valuables, specifically black market valuables. He had been lucky already: a rare pepe fell on one of the soldiers during combat (they managed to roll nat 1 on initiative), and it would fetch a fair price on the market.\n\nAs the two entered the mall, they found a trio of soldiers. They said something about a bomb in the mall, before they were rudely interrupted by Dermock's Glock-18 and katana. One of them wasn't exactly a free kill, though, as Dermock had taken another shot and wouldn't be able to take much more (0 HP). The other two were, one was armed with a dry strand of spaghetti and the other with a banana. Dermock took this single spaghetto and banana, and against his better judgement, he said they should continue looking around. \n\nRight on cue, as he turned a corner, he was face to face against a squad of soldiers.\n\nWhoops.\n\nDermock did the first thing he could think of - raise a firearm to them, and intimidate them out of his way. Unfortunately for him, he didn't have Quick Draw yet, and the banana, which felt very vaguely firearm-like, was still in his hand. So he ended up pointing a banana at a group of soldiers, telling them to back away.\n\n* I rolled to intimidate. Natural 1.\n\nTo make things worse, Dermock panicked in this process, accidentally squeezing the banana too hard - it splattered all over him and the floor, and while dazed, he dropped the banana and slipped on it, making him prone.\n\nHe still also had the spaghetto in his hand, and it wouldn't mean any effort to actually snap it, so he then threatened to snap mom's spaghetti.\n\nThe soldiers all agreed that dad's spaghetti was better.\n\nDermock was really desperate now. These soldiers would kill him, real easily too. He was a sitting duck.\n\nThat's it. Duck.\n\nDermock was wearing a ghillie suit, and it had been splattered to a banana colour, the same colour as the banana stuff all over the floor he was lying prone on (look this was a [$44.99 banana](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/38618308277948191/81CDE1D1EC7CA96FA21C7D7D88955ED137A23B43/)  and that's not just because of the inflation ok). So he made one final, desperate attempt to hide.\n\n* I rolled to Hide. 17 roll, + 1 rank, + 3 dex, + 10 ghillie suit = a success ok? math is hard\n\nRemember how I said the DM tends to stereotype? Well, he did that here. Apparently the soldiers were using animal stats, and because of that, thought I disappeared. They immediately went after Abdul instead, who ran back around the corner. Dermock soon heard a ticking noise and panicked footsteps running out the door. Standing back up, he turned the corner to see Abdul, and a ticking object on the floor - oh, it's an egg timer strapped to a bunch of other stuff. Dermock opened it, and there was a hard boiled egg blessed by Abdul's god, which, after asking for permission, was greedily eaten by the hungry and wounded gnoll.\n\nThey had chased the soldiers out, so the storekeepers popped back up to sell a few things before they packed up and headed out. Still fearing a bomb threat, Dermock made his business quick - he went to an airsoft store bought an airsoft M4 Carbine, and illegally painted the tip gunmetal grey, along with some ammunition of both airsoft and non-airsoft varieties, and quickly left.\n\nAnd that's the end of this story.\n\n^^By ^^the ^^way, ^^the ^^M4 ^^actually ^^came ^^in ^^really ^^handy. ^^As ^^in, ^^got ^^a ^^Barrett ^^.50 ^^cal ^^and ^^an ^^RPG-7 ^^from ^^a ^^single ^^intimidate ^^check ^^kind ^^of ^^handy.",

Hadn't played in a while and the gathering of funds has been a pain in the ass, but it's going well.\n\nSince then, I scouted out a sector devoid of other races' stations. It proved to be somewhat rich in asteroid-based resources, so it got picked to be my staging area/construction yard. Thus began the long process of populating it with stations. At this point, the sector contains:\n\n* 5 food factories\n* 4 farm stations\n* 3 crystal factories\n* 2 ore mines\n* 4 silicon mines\n* 2 shield factories, for fighter and frigate shields\n* 3 weapons factories, for cheap missiles, fighter and frigate cannons. \n\nIt's all powered by one solar power plant, which still manages to create a surplus of energy. Yet to be built are additional shield factories for destroyers and carriers; as well as weapon factories to supply them with turret cannons, heavy missiles and torpedoes; an equipment dock to consolidate all the gear and upgrades; and a headquarters to serve as a shipyard. I'll also have to expand the other stations to keep up with the demand, but that's easy.\n\nThe fleet itself hasn't seen much progress. Spent about 30 million on a cargo ship that can carry stations, another 60+ million on additional cargo ships to keep the stations supplied and about 20 million on yet other cargo ships that simply roam the universe and trade freight in my name. Roughly 50 million went into buying and outfitting my current flagship, a frigate that I lovingly named Normandy. The only other ship of note is a puny little corvette, which will be relegated to sector patrol duty, once I have a handful of frigates and at least one destroyer for my main battle fleet.\n\nWhen I'm not building military stations and making sure they're stocked, my time is taken up by plotting the campaign of devastation that I will visit upon Sol. I will need to move slowly, wiping out one sector at a time. Ships are an absolute priority. Unfortunately, Terran ships are quite powerful and I have no idea how many are waiting for me. I will need a large fleet of destroyers and carriers, fully equipped and stocked with heavy fighters, as well as missile frigates. Guns don't have the damage output necessary to swiftly pummel stations into space dust.\n\nSimply eradicating entire sectors isn't enough, though. I'll need to leave a standing fleet in every Terran sector, because the game will respawn their stations and shipyards and I want them destroyed before they can build a single ship. I want them completely locked down. Not a single Terran will leave Sol again.\n\nThere is a lot of work yet to be done. I will need to step up my income something fierce, many stations that still need to be built and I am still stuck getting my ships from other shipyards. But the crusade has started. They may not know it yet, may not realize it, but their end is coming.",

        "text": "I love Doppelgangers. I think it's quite entertaining to let the players be freely suspicious and paranoid at each other now and again, and the Doppelganger is a great way to do it if done properly.\n\nToday I finally have a game tale worth sharing. I was running a one-shot set in my 5e campaign with a mix of my regulars playing new characters, and players who had never set foot in this world before.\n\nThe cast: \n\n* Morrigan - the human bard who always has a dreamy, distracted expression and loves books\n* Silkbeard - a Dwarf Barbarian who happens to be a noble \n* Kaze - a Human spirit Barbarian \n* The Judge - a Dwarf Cleric of Light\n\nMorrigan's player wasn't with us when we kicked off, and it started as your standard dungeon crawl through an abandoned mine. The 2 dwarf and Kaze slew some demons and answered questions three, and it was all standard.\n\nThey took a short rest when Morrigan's player finished work and Kaze's player went to collect her. She turned up, pizza was consumed and the adventure continued with her bumping into them during their Short rest. They continued following the straight line toward their objective, ignoring a couple of side passageways. As they went past, Morrigan's player was asked to do 2 perception checks (one as they walked past, one as they jumped the ravine just beyond the tunnel entrance), and crit-failed both.\n\nThey continued on through two more caverns fighting some demons and nearly dying to two Intellect Devourers who came very close to ending both the Dwarves' lives.\nThey took a long rest, and I had Morrigan do another perception check, which she passed.\n\nI described her realising she was hungry after having spent the last 8 hours reading. She asked me what the others were doing and I commented that there were no others, she'd been alone reading for the last 8 hours and was getting hungry. Confused, the player had Morrigan leave the cavern she was in and join the main corridor. She turned right and the player recognised the area, and had the character follow the tracks of the party.\n\nWhen she came to the cavern entrance I described her seeing the human barbarian, and that she did not recognise him. The human barbarian was confused, and looked over his shoulder to where the Morrigan he was familiar with was reading a book. This familiar Morrigan stood up and the poor player had to have an argument with herself, describing the two as \"Familiar\" and \"Unfamiliar\". \n\nIt ended when the Familiar one who had been with the party tried to murder the imposter. a fight ensued, and very quickly the unfamiliar lay dead on the floor. The dwarves had been sleeping and were roused. \n\nThey investigated the body, Nature checks revealed \"this is a perfectly normal dead human female\", arcana checks revealed \"there is no sign of any magical effects about her\". They were very confused, and for good measure Morrigan stabbed the Unfamiliar one, making her fail her death saving throws.\n\nThe session continued, the players found the artifacts and returned in time to save the village from the threat. Once that was done she asked me \"what the fuck was that?\" \n\nTo which I responded \"**It was you, your character. You were playing the Doppelganger.**\"\n\nTL:DR; I make player unknowingly play the Doppelganger first, the character second. Player has the doppelganger murder her own character without realizing the truth.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3w3wm1/twitch_trolls_pokemon_part_three_the_bane_of/",
        "text": "TL;DR of the previous recaps:\n\n* There is [a Pokemon universe](https://www.reddit.com/r/twitchplayspokemon/) in which a hivemind called \"The Voices\" infest the mental processes of (un)lucky heroes, called Hosts, and direct their actions to stumble around the Pokemon world righting wrongs.\n* \"Lord\" Bill MacKenzie is a Well-Intentioned Extremist who does everything within his power to stop the Voices, eventually committing every crime in the book except prostitution. Inevitably, the Voices get fed up with this and decide to kill him.\n* Bill realizes that his death is inevitable at this point, so, among other things, he creates a computer program doppelganger of himself, named Lord_Bill.exe, to carry on his purpose after his death. \n* This does not work out as planned. Specifically, through [a series of bafflingly meta coincidences,](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3smiit/twitch_trolls_pokemon_part_one_the_meta_creation/) one of the Voices (Trollkitten) winds up with eighty-four percent of Lord_Bill.exe trapped on her excruciatingly slow five-year-old laptop.\n* Bill.exe \"creates his own\" Reddit account (now defunct for reasons unrelated to the RP) and proceeds to, as is his sacred duty as a MacKenzie, bother the hay out of the Voices. \n* Eventually [.Exe realizes that What He Is Doing Is Wrong](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3so1b3/twitch_trolls_pokemon_part_two_methinks_the/) (both in the moral sense and in the way he talks, Which Is Literally Like This), which leads him to a crisis of existence: this is what he was programmed to do, but he knows he shouldn't be doing it.\n* Meanwhile, a couple of other Voices start shipping Bill.exe with Trollkitten, which .Exe picks up on, with naive, sometimes creepy, sometimes hilarious, and sometimes completely facepalming results.\n\nThe problem with being the digital successor to one of the most hated men in history is that you inherit a lot of enemies.\n\nEnter /u/Bane_of_BILLEXE.\n\nBefore I know it, there's suddenly *another* virus on my laptop, and a far ruder one to boot -- one that's constantly making innuendos at Bill.exe while trying to trap him in virus-infected Flash games. And the worst part is, nobody much knows what to do about it. \n\nBill.exe tries to trap it and e-mail it off to some other sucker -- no dice. He tries to build himself a competitive Pokemon team in a Blaze Black 2 download to defend himself -- the laptop's too slow to make any progress. He tries to go after Bane personally -- I, Trollkitten, slap some literal restraining bolts on him to keep him and Bane from tearing up my laptop. Bane continues to mock Bill.exe with taunts, violent threats, inappropriate app downloads, and raunchy comments, and in the meantime, all of Bane's sex jokes leave /u/Bytemite still singing the shipping song. (It doesn't help that Bill.exe is so clueless on the matters of human reproduction, Bytemite keeps thinking that Bill.exe has Bill MacKenzie's organic memories and is intentionally making innuendos himself.) \n\nAnd meanwhile, I, Trollkitten, am not-so-quietly facepalming at how quickly things have degenerated.\n\nEventually Bill.exe manages to actually trap Bane in a decoy program similar to Bane's own, a program with a name I can't remember, except that it was, like Bane's own programs, offensive. And then, with his enemy contained, Bill.exe starts a strawpoll on Reddit to ask the Voices what they think he should do with Bane, not revealing that, since he's a Bill, he's doing to do the exact opposite.\n\nMeanwhile, much to some people's horror (Bane's most of all) the program trap that Bane is in is slowly ripping Bane's coding apart.\n\nThe Voices vote to kill Bane, which Bill.exe, of course, immediately vetoes. But as Bane appears to be dying anyway, and in immense pain as well (even for a computer program), Bill.exe suffers a crisis of conscience. Which, immediately, proves that Bill.exe *has* a conscience. (Ironically, this is the exact point in which Bill.exe's speaking glitch unexpectedly corrects itself. Probably a metaphor for something, but in truth, I just forgot I was supposed to Keep Capitalizing Everything Ever.)\n\nBane of Bill.exe is writhing inside the computer program, doing the digital equivalent of hemorrhaging. /u/Gioz2 is telling Bill.exe what a horrible person he is. Bill.exe, realizing the horror of what he's done, immediately decides to try to fix Bane's remaining coding into *something* \"alive\" and sentient that **won't** kill him.\n\nAnd then /u/Gadzooks3 comes up with a brilliant idea to tell Bane, who has completely forgotten who and what it is:\n\n&gt; You're Bane. You're a fluffy zigzagoon and you like giving everyone hugs and flowers. Did you forget?\n\nBill's Zigzagoon, for those who don't know, was [a ferret-like Pokemon](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Zigzagoon) briefly obtained in Randomized FireRed that became known in Twitch Plays Pokemon lore as Bill's lovably incompetent hench-mon. Bill's Zigzagoon was a good soul at heart and a lover of ice cream, but was impossibly naive, practically worshiped Bill, and would do almost anything for him.\n\nAnd now Bane, who was created to be Bill.exe's sworn enemy and had been giving him flak since Day One, gets reprogrammed by Bill.exe under Gadzook's coaching to believe himself to be Bill.exe's own loyal hench-mon. \n\nWhile the name \"Bob\" gets thrown around a couple of times for Ziggy-Bane's new name, being the acronym of Bane Of Bill.exe, it never sticks, so the program retains the name of \"Bane,\" or, affectionately, \"Ziggybane.\" \n\nAnd he *totally* makes an adorable sidekick to Bill.exe.\n\nThis can't possibly backfire badly in the future, can it?\n\nTo be continued...",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3w2f73/rainbow6_siege_i_had_one_of_the_best_games_in_my/",
        "text": "Out for a week - Rainbow 6: Siege is an intense game which is essentially 'Counter Strike with gadgets'. Short rounds, 5v5, one life only; storm / defend an objective in a building that features destructible walls. There's also a short time pre-match where the defenders reinforce and attackers recon with camera drones.\n\nThe following story was posted in /r/rainbow6 by /u/TimLoz. For those that haven't played, the classes mentioned have the following abilities:\n\n**Castle** - Places extra tough barricades on doorways and windows    \n**Mute** - Drops device that disables approaching drones (&amp; other electrics)    \n**Ash / Sledge** - Extra fast barricade smashers   \n**Glaz** - Sniper    \n**Fuze** - Attaches device on outside of a wall that pumps four mini grenades into the room    \n**Blitz** - Carries shield with a blinding flashlight panel   \n\n[Story source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/3vy3l1/i_had_one_of_the_best_games_in_my_15_year_gaming/)\n____\n\nJust thought I would share how epic this game can be, even with the issues that come up from time to time.\n\nSo I queued into a ranked match with a friend last night. We got into the game and our fifth teammate dropped instantly. So here we are, stuck on 4 v 5 for the entirety of the match. We were on Consulate, so because of the beta we were pretty familiar with the setup of the map and round 1 of attacking it gets down to just me v 2. I get one downed and the other flanks me, we lose.\n\nRound two we setup upstairs, castle the windows and block them with Mute. We feel pretty secure, as cameras show no ash or sledge on the other team. We guard the two entry doors and take the other team out pretty easily with them funneled in a way we can control.\n\nThe next few rounds play out pretty similarly, we can't overcome the 4 v 5 on offense, but set up our defense the same way and the other team never adjusted making our strategy work well the whole time.\n\nWe get to the 6th round, down 3-2 and our castle guy gets disconnected. Instantly it's a 3 v 5 and we have no way of covering the windows. All feels hopeless. The guy is able to rejoin, but has to sit out the round. Within a few seconds I see a wood panel fly off a window so I turn, throw a nitrocell and detonate. Now it's 3 v 4. I'm watching one door and a window, we have the other two watching the other door and two windows. Blitz busts in and gets shotgunned by my team mate while he's blinded. He actually only knows he got the kill because I told him. 3 v 3.\n\nGlaz leans out and takes out my two team mates in an instant with two headshots. 1 v 3. I lean over, handle Glaz easily from my flanking angle. 1 v 2. Fuze then places his device on the door right in front of me, and as I run for my life I spot where he had moved to before setting his trap off. 1 v 1, but Fuze hit me pretty bad and I'm down to 32 health and way out of position.\n\nI see something streak across the screen and suddenly the hostage is picked up with the defender sprinting out the way he came in. I start booking after him, literally in a chase through winding hallways on the upper level. If he knew how low of health I had, he very easily could have turned around after running through a door and handled me with his pistol, but he continues running down the hallway. After about a 15 second chase he starts running down the huge stair case in the center of the map. I get to the top of the staircase, ADS and get the headshot right before he was gone for good.\n\nMy heart is pounding and I physically feel as if I actually ran down the hallways after the guy. But no time to catch my breath, it's overtime.\n\nWe get lucky and start OT on defense, handle round 1 pretty easily. now that we have all four guys back and we can run our strategy the same way again. Round 2 we get it down to a 2 v 2, but get trapped in a corner and get taken out by good flanking. So down to the final round of OT. Still 4 v 5. Every team has only won as defenders and we are on defense.\n\nFuze takes out one teammate with his device. 3 v 5. Glaz takes out another 2 v 5. How is our same defensive strategy suddenly not working when they never changed? All this craziness for nothing? Blitz busts in, I shoot him in the side but not before he takes my teammate down to 4 health. 2 v 4. I take out fuze but he lights me up. 2 v 3. Glaz one shots me. 1 v 3. Teammate is out of position, leaves the room shotguns two guys with three quick shots to the back. 1 v 1. Glaz has our teammates flank, but misses 4 shots as my teammate sprints away, knowing he can't take glaz at distance with a shotgun. He hides in the corner of the hostage room. 5 seconds left, Glaz grabs the hostage because he has no other choice, not knowing where my last teammate is. My teammate pops up as Glaz passes in front of him. He shoots one shotgun blast, which downs the hostage, but luckily kills Glaz. We win a ranked match in 9 rounds down 4 v 5 the entire time.\n\nI've never felt more pressure on a video game in my life. I've never felt like such an underdog and still pulled out a win in miraculous fashion.\n\nThis is just a snapshot of what this game is possible of providing. Some of the most intense moments with the highest highs and lowest lows, all in one match.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this book I just wrote on one random ranked match I played, I hope you enjoyed it! :D\n",

        "text": "I made a long ass post on my gaming communities forums, because we all played AA when it very first came out. And it was super fun. This isnt much of a tale but more so of a collection of experiences we had, i'm gonna copy paste directly from our forums. Ill try to edit some of it for readability. \n\n=============================================\n\nIn a world torn by war,\n \nActually fuck it, anyway nostalgia thread. here i will type long words because holy fuck we had a blast playing this game. \n \nThose who don't know, AA was/is an open world mmo thing, that Test played for a few months. In fact it was so popular, our stratop numbers were awful, because everyone was playing this game.\n \nIm just gonna list off quotes and things and explain how it worked, ill link the threads at the bottom for you to explore. i had a blast writing this. \n \nWe had over 100 nerds in our guild, which was awesome. We mostly did PvP, but the fun part is, that when a zone is contested/at war, you can attack your own faction, same with the open ocean, free for all. So Test was a pirate guild, sort of. \n \nThe main thing was open world PvP, and trade packs/ trade runs. the running of trade packs for dollarydoos. \n \nTrade packs were the main source of income. so we would group and do valuable ones, or if solo you just did the best safe ones you could do. you only could walk while carrying a pack as well, and so this is why donkeys were made. Donkeys allow you to ride them, and you get to jog with them while holding a pack. To join us on pack runs, you had to be level 10, and you were required to have a donkey. Otherwise you were too slow, and 30 dudes didn't wanna wait on you to walk. So you were either a scout, meatshield, or just protection.\n \nSo wed form like 40 or 50 dudes up, and all get trade packs, then move as a blob to the best paying area for it.  Trade packs are crafted in certain zones, and then taken to a trader at another for a lot of gold, depending on how far away it was, this took time, and could also be very risky, since you can only walk when carrying a pack. Since they were valuable, people would try to kill you when they could, steal your pack, and turn it in for themselves. So, the point was to have a group. The best paying ones were in the pvp zones.\n \nWe also did mercenary work, since most of the players were carebears and didn't like to PvP. We didnt do this much really. Usually we were the ones killing them and stealing the packs. \n \nSince we had a huge number advantage over most any other guild ( there were a few good guilds, like oranthul which was the PL of AA) otherwise, we could just blob people and still win, we would blockade ports. So we would have a good 40 or so of us, with around 15 boats, and line up outside a city during wartime, and attack anyone who tried to do a trade run into it. you made mad dollars for doing runs during war. So wed kill them and take the packs and use them ourselves. The ships had a few weapons, namely the harpoon, which could latch on to other ships and slow/drag them in. So 1 guy would get first harpoon/tackle, then the rest of us would converge onto him and attack, steal their shit and turn it in for ourselves. Eventually the server learned to let newbies go ahead that didn't know better, and wait for us to pounce, and then try to skirt around us during the frenzy of our assault on the other poor bastard. Or hire mercs, which usually didn't work since we had a lot of nerds. Even with most of us at level 15-25, since we had so many, we could easily overrun a group of like 7 level 50s, which normally is more than enough protection.. sure wed take losses, but we still won. Usually you would see a boat of trade runners try to get as close as possible, then abandon ship and try to swim for it. this sometimes worked, cause guards near the turn in would attack any pvp action, or they would all starbust and swim like crazy, usually we got 70% of them. Even still, we would use their boat for our own uses until it despawned after a few hours. heres a pic of our line, and another one of how we caught people. http://i.imgur.com/WXQRJbP.jpg\nhttp://i.imgur.com/5RaK1y2.png\n \nSometimes one of the major guilds would roll into town, and have a galleon (biggest ship) full of 50s, so we simply scooted out of the way and let them by, while trying to keep other traders from going through the opening we made for them. I also managed to broker an \"alliance\" with Oranthul or something like that, (they didn't really ever do faction on faction pvp, but when they saw us doing it, they would help us out or just not attack us) Before the alliance sometimes they would kill us during faction ganking because we were niggers. So wed let them by, and never attacked each other. and they let us get on with our dastardly deeds in peace. Yeah like the CFC lel. Oranthul wasn't particularly liked by anyone, but they were the PL of AA. Really good, but also expensive, usually we were pretty cool with each other. they had some bro tier dudes. The other superpower was another merc guild called Catch XXII. We didn't fuck with them though.\n \nThe ocean was also an open zone, and it was HUGE. also, fuck the kraken, huge npc that would wreck your shit. Anyway, you could attack anyone at any time on it, and it took a good 30 mins to get to the other side. also had islands and shit out there. if we saw people, we usually would attack (or break if off if it was too much to handle). Early on, the boats were kinda buggy, so we all had to stand in certain spots to make sure to not fall off, and god help you if you fell off during a boat chase, we didn't have time to stop and get you and still catch our victim. so you swam for a little while until we managed to come back and pick you up.\n \n \nThere were also carriages, which were npc controlled that traveled between cities, usually if you didn't have a donkey you'd ride these because they were fast. very early on we used these before donkeys were a thing we found, and it was neat. we played on an rp server, so it was really cool to chat with people on the carts and shit\n \nfor the few months we played, a lot of spaceship drama came from it. Stratop numbers were abysmal because we were all playing this, and we had to yell at people to get into fleet. a lot of dudes were mad about low numbers. \n \n&gt;Quote\n\"&gt;Leon OrikiPostmaster General\n&gt;Jump Drive Appreciation Society\n&gt;1,166 postsPosted 25 September 2014 - 13:14 Also, because of constant scamming and ganking; Test Guild Please Ignore is already starting to become hated on Tahyang. Mission accomplished, folks.\"\n \n After a while, we started to become infamous for being dicks, after all, eve is one of the few games that allows you to be an asshole, so we took it to AA. Wed gank our faction when we could, especially if we saw them trying to do a quest and fighting npcs, wed wait til they were low and go in for the kill. i solod a lot of high levels doing this. There were many ways to be a dick. \n \nScamming was sorta allowed, some dudes would steal money, or try to extort people. Could also destroy illegal farms, and most of the time wed tell them to pay us or well destroy the farm.\n \nAA also has a jail system, and the more crime points the more time you'd spend if convicted. Basically once you get crime points they stay iirc, and if killed, you are off to court.  The jury was made of players, and you'd try to argue your case to get off scot free. Before we became known, wed simply say we had been killing gold farmers and bots (which holy fuck were a problem) and most people were like cool, ok, free to go. (we lied obviously). and sometimes the victim would see us in jury chat, and try to get us convicted. we spent a lot of time in jail. Whenever one of our own went to court, wed all pipe up in jury chat saying how hes a cool guy. After a while, we became known for our antics, and a lot of jurors would just see our guild name and convict us. Sometimes you could bribe them as well, and pay them money if they didn't convict. we made sure to actually honor the deal, because we knew wed be back in the court room sooner or later, and hoped to at least have a few of them in our pocket. \n \nGliders were something you got for doing some gay starter quest. and they yeah, let you glide around p neat. We would also hotdrop people, and when things got hot, run to the nearest cliff and take off. There were lots of tactics used for escapes, since non of us really bothered to level too high, and relied on overrunning our foes. If things got too sticky, an every man for himself was called, and we would scatter. They couldn't catch all of us.\n \nShips were really expensive at first, but after a while we did a ton of trade runs and most people had one.\n \n&gt;Quote\n&gt; Elite Qin\n&gt;Involved\n &gt;Dreddit\n&gt;202 posts\n &gt;Posted 05 Ocober 2014 - 16:52\n&gt;WE GOT ENOUGH GILDA FOR A MERCHANT SHIP\n&gt;It'll arrive tomorrow at about 3:45 PM EST, and we can get the ship built and moving quickly after that.  We'll be able to make money and pirate much easier with this ship.  It'll be superdope.\n \nMerchant ships were large ships, that held like 20 or 30 trade packs... slow and vulnerable, but high risk meant high reward...\n \n \nSometimes we would do actual pvp, and go to the other factions continent on raids. We just wanted to fight and kill, wasn't really any rewards from doing this. These raids were pretty hilarious, usually it was small gang stuff, sometimes a ton of us would go. We fought with a group called Somalian coast guard a bunch, which was basically the other factions version of us.\n \nLater on when we had been playing a while, a lot of us were high level. so new tactics were made. The high levels would be the main attack force, while lowbies would play a support role, like harpooning and steering the ship, securing the packs, scouting, and healing.\n \nwe got a big ship too http://i.imgur.com/zpWcbj7.jpg\n \nI hope you enjoyed reading this, i had fun writing it, feel free to comment with questions, or if you played with us share a story and your experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=============\n\nAnyway, thats the tales of Archeage that we all had. Too bad it died. ",
