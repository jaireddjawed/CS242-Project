        "text": "So a quick rundown of me, I’ve been burned a fuckton in relationships, probably due to doing the same to people in the past. Relationships terrify me now, and flirting is just awkward as hell. I also follow a few rules, keep it to a minimum in the workplace, don’t flirt with servers, hosts, or any captive audience. I have never had trouble, save for one instance. \n\nI’m at my local coffee shop enjoying a nice frappe during the hotter season a few years back. Then in comes my dream girl, absolutely beautiful in every way, and a voice that carried such a tone that was like a symphony to my ears. Well I see her throw on an apron and get behind the counter, so I just mutter “fuck” under my breath and carry on. Well I end up ordering a quick sweet bite, and let slip something to the effect of, “can I also get a side of your smile?” I quickly paid and left after I got a nasty look. Both embarassed and super pissed off at myself, I went back in, apologized, and left. Haven’t gone back yet either... ",

This wasn’t served as part of the buffet so we had to pay extra - no big deal. Our server said they had some being prepared and it would be about a 15 minute wait. It’ll be good to note My parents were noticeably excited to try this as well.\n\nOur server brought out the calamari and we tried it as soon as our waiter left, it didn’t taste good at all - almost as though it was prepared improperly or it wasn’t fresh. Over half the dish remained and none of us wanted to eat it.\n\nAt the end of our dinner, the server picked up our plates and noticed the calamari wasn’t really even touched, and asked if everything tasted okay. My parents aren’t ones to raise complaints - especially to say “yeah your chef cooked this wrong.” They said everything was good, and the server left with our plates.\n\nHe came back with our receipt and when we saw the calamari listed there, the price was $0.00 - our server voided it.\n\nYou can bet he was thanked immediately and given a 30% tip.

        "text": "So last Sunday I made the mistake of ordering pizza from a well known chain that has gone down in quality over the past few years.  Their delivery has always takes at least an hour, but my wife likes their pan pizza and I think their wings are alright, so we just go for it.  I order online and leave a % based tip, hoping that maybe the up front tipping would put me at the top of the list for delivery. \n\nNope.  Still takes an hour, but it gets worse.  He brings me the receipt to sign, then pulls the pizza out of his \"keep warm\" bag.  \n\n\"Thanks, where's the wings?\"\n\n\"Wings?  Hold on.  Let me check the receipt.\"  And he goes back to his car, rolls down the window and shouts \"I'll be right back.\"  \n\nThat was the last time I saw him.  Two hours later, I'm fuming.  I call the manager and explain my situation.  Her response was \"Oh yeah, he mentioned that.  I'll talk to him when he gets back.\"  \n\n\"Ok, well we're done eating, so can I just get a refund for the wings I paid for and tipped on.\"  \n\n\"I can't do that.  I can give you a credit, but you have to use it in the next 30 days and you have to call into this store to use it.\"  \n\n\"Do you understand I just paid for something I never received?  I'd rather just have a refund than have to deal with this service again.\"  \n\n\"You have to come in to get a refund for the wings.  I'll make a note here and leave it by the register.\"  \n\nSo now I gotta use my gas to go to this store that I placed a delivery order at.  Whatever, it's about the principle at this point.  I make it in yesterday and again explain my situation.  \n\nCashier - \"Hold on, I can't find any record of your order.\"\n\nMe - \"Yeah.  I made it online.  Here's the receipt.\"\n\nCashier - \"OK I found you, pizza and a cookie right?  I don't see any wings.\"  \n\nMe - \"No.  See.  My receipt.  This line item.  The one that says wings.\"  (this goes back and forth several times with her typing my phone number into the system incorrectly at least twice)\n\nCashier - \"Hmm hold on.\"  (takes a phone call order for 5 minutes, then goes to the back and I don't see her for another 5 minutes)  \n\nShe finally returns with 7 dollars and it's over.  I leave and don't ever plan to come back.  \n\nYou know what the worst part was though?  Not one apology.  Not the delivery guy, not the cashier or manager I called, and not the cashier I dealt with at the end.  Not even a fake apology. ",

        "text": "So it has been really hot out, and humid on top of it, so cooking just wasn't in the cards on Tuesday. I had been moving furniture all day, and needed a break, so I decided to order a pizza.\n\nIt is bad enough that a pizza with one topping costs  nearly $20, but I had a coupon code that brought it down to about $11. Then tax, a delivery charge, and a $3 tip took it back to $19. \n\nA few minutes pass and the skies open up and it begins to rain. It was one of those summer storms that disappears as quickly as it started, but the ground was wet and there were puddles.\n\nThe Pizza Tracker App shows that the pizza is en route, so I open the front door to wait for the driver.\n\nA few minutes pass and my phone rings, with a name and number I don't recognize... I pick it up, and the girl on the other end tells me that she is outside with my pizza. I hang up and go to the door, but do not see her. She is not on the porch, in the driveway, or even at the curb, so, puzzled, I walk outside.\n\nI see the neighbors outside on their porch a few houses past mine, and realize they are watching a car that has driven up onto their curb, and is trying to get back into the roadway. \n\nI holler over to them that I think that is my pizza, and start down the steps to the road. The driver is back on the road by this point, and I wonder if she is going to either get out of the car to deliver my pizza, or come back to the house in her car. She does neither, but begins to drive up the street very slowly. I chase after the car, waving my arms like a madwoman, and she doesn't seem to notice me. \n\nBy this point, my socks are saturated with rainwater, and I am RUNNING up the street after her car, as she speeds up and drives away from me.\n\nJust before she turns onto the side street, she notices me, stops the car, gets out, pulls my (cold) pizza from the back seat, and hands it to me without a word.\n\nI was more than a bit annoyed. She was paid AND TIPPED to deliver the pizza to me. \n\nI would not have tipped her at all, if I had known in advance I was going to have to chase her to get my overpriced, cold pie.",

The owner knew me on sight as one of his regulars, and they would have my usual sandwich waiting for me by the time I got to the front of the line (yeah, I'm that much of a creature of habit). I'd take the sandwich, go back to my office, sit in the lunchroom and read while I ate.\n\nOne day, the onions were off. That same day, just by wild chance, the owner wandered into my office lunchroom while I was eating to deliver a catering order and said hello. I mentioned that the onions were off, that I didn't expect anything, just wanted him to know to get them out of circulation.\n\nThe next time I wandered in, the owner told me that my sandwich was on the house, so I bought a bag of chips because I wanted to cause some cash flow, and he insisted that was free, also. So . . . I left a tip like I usually would have, just with the amount I would have spent on food added to it.\n\nNeedless to say, I continued going to that same shop about once a week until my company moved me to a different office a couple of towns over.",

        "text": "A few weeks ago I was visiting my parents. They live a little over 200 miles from me. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but my dad mentioned he had been on the phone with a car satellite radio company (I will call them DS) trying to figure out why they were sending him emails about a car I own that has never been associated with any type of identifying information tied to him or my mom. The reason I didn’t get concerned at the time is because my dad and I share the same first, middle, and last names. The only difference in our names is a Roman numeral. We’ve dealt with people confusing us for one another most of my life. We chalked it up to DS being stupid, a fluke occurrence even, and moved on to more important and interesting topics of conversation. I didn’t think about it again... until this morning.\n\nWhen I checked my email today, I saw a message from DS with the subject “Important Account Reminder.” I usually automatically delete emails from DS, but thought I might see what this one was about since it included the word “reminder” in the subject. The email notified me that I have a radio ID that isn’t associated with my online account and two options were presented to rectify the situation: press the “Register NOW” button in the email to take care of it online or call them (at a phone number not listed on their website) to speak with a customer service agent. Nothing too troubling, although I only own one vehicle currently that has an active subscription to their service. I thought I would scroll down and see the radio listed for the other vehicle we own that we had a free trial period that expired several years ago. I thought wrong. \n\nListed below (in addition to the car we own that has an active subscription) was the full radio ID, make, and model of a car owned by my parents. The conversation with my dad a few weeks before immediately came to mind. Not one to think this could be resolved online, I decided to call DS. Today is a day off for me, so I thought I would be able to take the time to get this straightened out. Here is my account of that fruitless effort. \n\nUpon calling and getting through the stupid automated system that doesn’t seem to understand clearly spoken commands (even in the most annunciated and condescending tone I could muster), I was put into contact with a female customer service agent. I will call her A1. \n\nI explained the email I received to A1, and requested to get this straightened out so that I would stop receiving notifications about my parents’ vehicle and vice versa. She apologized and ready beautifully from her list of scripted responses, saying she would resolve the situation. A1 asked if the phone number I was calling from was associated with my account, to which I confirmed. She then asked for my address for verification. After I told it to her, she asked if my address had ever been different for my account, to which I responded with “no.” A long pause from A1 followed. Uh-oh. \n\nI then asked her if my address was listed as my parents’ address. She confirmed. I asked A1 how my account with a different physical address, email address, phone number, and payment identification could be possibly linked to my dad’s account. She stated that she did not know, but that all information for accounts is strictly limited to updates from customers. I told A1 that my dad isn’t the smartest person (although he is extremely intelligent and detail-oriented), but that he isn’t some idiot that doesn’t know his own address or other identifying information. A1 immediately began backpedaling by stating that was not what she was implying. I told her that is what it sounded like. Another long pause...\n\nA1 then returned to her script stating that she would resolve the situation, but I did not let her avoid my question: “How did this happen?” A1 stated that she did not know, so I asked to speak with someone that could provide that information. A1 asked me to hold so that she could contact her supervisor. Awesome hold music followed for a good 2 minutes. A1 comes back on and tells me her supervisor is not answering, and she returns to her script on resolving the issue while attempting to avoid answering my question.\n\nIf nothing else, I am stubborn. I refuse to let her drop my question. I ask her if people with truly common names (I can only find around 60 people in the US that have my same first and last name, and it’s only me and my dad in the state where we live) get emails like this with radio IDs that belong to complete strangers. Stammering response (the script doesn’t cover that)... I tell A1 that I am not frustrated with her. My frustration is with her company (DS). I then asked her if DS databases accounts based on first and last name. A1 responds that no, it is by physical address, email address, and phone number. So, I take her back to my question she keeps trying to avoid: how did this happen? “Sir please hold as I try to reach my supervisor again.”\n\nSeveral minutes on hold are spent listening to the best smooth jazz has to offer and thinking about all of the identifying information for my dad that has been given to me: physical address confirmed, email address, radio ID, and his car year, make, and model. I try not to think about the other information I probably would have been able to acquire (phone number, credit card number, etc.). The next voice I hear is a male customer service agent who I will call A2. It is a polite voice, and he tells me that he is looking into the resolution for the issue that A1 has informed him of (the accounts being tied to one another). I tell A2 that is great, but that isn’t my main concern. Rehashing of same concerns listed to A1 commences. By this time, I’ve been on the phone for a good 20 minutes and am hoping we are almost to a point of resolution. Besides being stubborn, I guess I can be pretty naive at times, as well. \n\nAfter interrupting me several times while I am attempting to voice my concerns to A2, he asks to put me on hold so that he can speak with the “back office” to find out how this happened. More light jazz...\n\nWhen A2 returned to the line after several minutes, he tells me that they are unable to determine how the issue occurred and assured me they would resolve the account connection issue. I told him that was unacceptable and that DS should be in possession of records that detail when and how the accounts got connected. A2’s response: “I respect your position.” My response: “I appreciate that but do not care if you respect my position. I want answers. Who do I need to get involved?” Stammering from A2 ensues... lots of repeating scripted responses. I repeat that I do not care and demand answers. A2 asks to put me on hold so that he can check with the “back office” again. He asks me to verify the radio ID for my dad’s vehicle. I successfully try not to lose it on him, but make it clear that I believe it is unprofessional for him or DS to request information that belongs to a completely different customer from me. More light jazz...\n\nWhen A2 returns to the line after several minutes he tells me that he had opened an incident ticket and that I should expect to hear back in 7 to 10 days from DS’s corporate customer service team. I tell him okay (trying not to let him know I am wearing down) and ask which phone number I can expect to hear back from. A2 asks to put me on hold while he checks. Several more minutes of light jazz... it must be my lucky day!\n\nA2 comes back on the line and tells me there isn’t one particular number that they use. That sounds reasonable to me, but I wonder why it took him several minutes to figure that out. He provides me with the incident number, and I read it back to him purposely giving one incorrect digit about halfway through. He corrects me with the number her originally gave, so that makes me feel just a little bit better. I ask him to repeat his name, and A2 even offered up his employee ID to me without me asking for it. He also confirmed A1’s name, and provided me with a valid physical address to their corporate customer service team when I told him I would be writing a letter to DS to detail the situation, my concerns, and how it was handled during my call today. \n\n41 minutes of my life. Forever gone. A2 apologized (or at least read the scripted apology) for the time spent, and wished me a happy remainder of the day. Upon hanging up I immediately got online to confirm the information he gave me for their address with an online chat agent (A3), and I spent another 5 minutes on the phone with another customer service agent (A4) to verify the incident number given to me by A2 was legitimate. A4 told me that I should hear back in 3 to 5 business days, so that was the only discrepancy I could identify with what A2 told me. \n\nSo, time invested but nothing to show for it. Now I will spend more time crafting a letter and mailing it to DS’s corporate offices. Here’s to expecting nothing while hoping for the best!\n\nTLDR; satellite radio company inexplicably links my account and my dad’s account, lots of time wasted on the phone, and nothing yet to show for it with the exception of getting to listen to some awesome light jazz while on hold.

I was really stressed and exhausted for the past few days because my professor just keeps on rejecting my Title proposals BUT that rejection also became my source of happiness 'cause it gave me the chance to spend more time in the Coffee Shop where this cute cashier guy is actually working. \n\nI always visit that Coffee Shop, maybe two or three times a day? Well not really because of their strongly brewed coffee but I always get to see the cashier wave his chestnut colored hair and glare at his shining blue eyes and those soft lips that makes me sip my coffee without blowing it first. His deep voice always greeted me in the most cheerful way as possible. I always love seeing his enthusiasm over the customers greeting him a good day, trying to stay upbeat throughout an exhausting day. \n\nOne afternoon, I went back to te shop to buy my usual overwhipped waffle as a treat for myself after a long tiring day. As I was looking at him placing my money into the cash register,  I accidentally said \"I Love You\" in my normal toned voice. I was really shocked and embarrased at the same time and I saw his cheeks blushing because of what I said. I quickly went into my seat and shortly after a guy with a green apron sitted right infront of me while I was covering my face because of an insane embarrasment . It was Him. He asked me if I really meant what I said earlier, making my face turn really red and sweaty. I told him that I really wanted to be friends with him and hangout a little. He replied and said that he felt the same thing about me. Huhuhuhu i cant even.  After that I ran out and went to my 6:00 pm class.\n\nOh yeah for those asking what happened.\nWe're fine and we're dating.\n\n\n",

        "text": "Hey guys, ltl;ftp. On mobile, so be gentle.\n\nI was at a place known for their burgers—I mean pancakes. We wanted to take advantage of their anniversary 60 cent pancakes and order a burger. We have one waitress for all of 20 seconds, then they switched with another, which is okay, she was probably getting off shift. No big deal.\n\nNow, I have social anxiety, especially when it comes to ordering food for some reason. My boyfriend ordered a burger, and I asked for the same. I stumbled over the order a little, because I was a little confused because of substitutions. I looked up, and the waitress was giving me the HARDEST stink eye. Which, of course, made me fumble over my words and forget some. She sighed and looked at me like the scum of the earth. I have no clue why I deserved such a harsh reaction, but it made my anxiety go into overdrive.\n\nWhen get nervous, I get progressively more frazzled and fuck things up. Every time she came over to our table, I felt inadequate and started to feel like I was embarrassing my boyfriend for being so incompetent. He reassured me I was fine afterward, but what started as a special treat (we don’t normally go to sit down restaurants) turned into epic proportions of being self conscious. Things like asking for a utensil set because I didn’t get one made her roll her eyes and huff. I mentioned how weird it was to my boyfriend, and he agreed. When we went to pay, apparently they just changed it so we had to pay our waitress at the table. They called her over to check us out, and we apologized for not reading the receipt. She hammered it in when she pointed to the receipt and told us, “See? It says here to pay at the table.”\n\nI’m normally a really friendly person and, having been a waitress before, tend to tip 20% or over and give people the benefit of the doubt. We still tipped, because she did do her basic job, but we tipped the minimum. I wish I could say I talked to her manager, but I just wanted to get out of there as soon as possible.\n\nI’m thinking about emailing corporate. I’ve only done this once before, and it was for a truly horrendous experience. I don’t know if she thought we were teenagers (I’m 26 and boyfriend is 30, but I have a baby face), but that still doesn’t excuse how she treated us. I’m afraid to ask my boyfriend if he remembers our server’s name, because he might think I’m overreacting. What do you think, is it worth it to complain?",

        "text": "On Mother’s Day 2017 my husband, son, in laws and I made reservations at an upscale steak house. The restaurant is a non-franchised chain with around 10 locations in three states. Ironically my husband worked at another location during college and so it’s our go to place with his parents. Because he worked there he’s very knowledgeable about the restaurants internal procedures and knows that each server only gets a max of 4 tables at a time. \n\nEverything was great when we arrived and we were seated right away. It was busy, but our server greeted us quickly, as she only had a few tables. I am a vegetarian (which doesn’t help) and it’s a family joke that I am cursed with food because restaurants constantly mess up my food in random and unexpected ways. When I first started dating my husband my in laws thought I must be terrible at ordering or unreasonably picky but after a few years of these ridiculous situations (example: restaurant giving my food to someone else and not realizing until everyone else was served at my wedding dinner) they have finally realized the truth of it. Instead of being an angry horrible customer I have learned to be as clear as possible and laugh at these situations.\n\nOn this particular day we received our drinks quickly and when it came time to order I was ready. There is only one thing one the menu that I can eat, so I ordered *special salad* with no chicken, and then provided the server with my little disclaimer. I let her know that I am a vegetarian and that even small amounts of meat would give me serious gastro issues and asked her to please be careful. \nIt took a while for the food to arrive, which wasn’t unexpected. It was Mother’s Day and while they had more then enough servers, the kitchen can only make things so quickly. The server brought out the food two orders at a time, dropping off my in-law’s food, followed by my husband and son’s, so it wasn’t unexpected when I was left without food in front of me. I waited patiently for about 10 minutes, but when it didn’t arrive I started looking around for our server. I got the attention of a different server and asked him to send ours over. After another 10 minutes our server comes back and says she will go get my salad, which is a bit uncomfortable because everyone else has finished eating. \n\n7-8 minutes later the store manager comes over and drops off my food and apologizes for the mix-up, but right away I notice that my salad has chicken on it. I immediately tell her that I am a vegetarian and that I ordered it without chicken. She seems frustrated and says she will fix it. She comes back with my salad maybe a minute later, the chicken gone. I am immediately concerned. 60 seconds didn’t seem like enough time for a remake, so I pick at it with my fork and sure enough, there are little pieces of chicken left over from when she went into the back and threw away the large pieces and brought me the same salad.\n\nI called the manager back and asked her if they had picked the chicken out or made a fresh salad. She insisted it was a fresh one, and that she had made it herself. I showed her the many small pieces of chicken, and I could see her face just fall. Without thinking she said “well I can assure you I remade it. There must be chicken in the lettuce, I’ll make you a fresh one”. I normally don’t give restaurants a hard time, but that really bothered me. I understand that mistakes happen, but I really hate it when people lie about it. It was obvious that she had picked the chicken out and the contaminated lettuce was a story to shift the fault on someone else, but I ran with it. I asked her why I would want another salad if the restaurants produce was contaminated with meat?  And on top of that, my entire party had gotten their food 40 minutes ago and had been finished eating for quite some time. I had her take my salad off the check, and decided it was a good Mother’s Day to just make something at home. \n\nThis is a really upscale place and normally we have great experiences, but this one really rubbed me the wrong way. It’s never a good sign when the store manager blatantly lies to you. What’s ironic is that this place almost never makes mistakes, but the last time we ate there with my in laws there was a much more horrible screw up that resulted in me spending three hours in the bathroom puking as well as other less pleasant symptoms. \n",

        "text": "I have a son who was a terrible sleeper as a newborn. So on Saturdays I would take him out all day so that his poor mother could get some much-needed rest. He's 7 now and we still do it because it's fun. We usually go out to lunch at some point.\n\nWhen he goes to the bathroom, I need to escort him so he doesn't get lost, kidnapped, hurt, or fuck stuff up. That leaves no one at our table for a minute or two. Lots of times we'll come back to find all our food taken away, even if it wasn't half-way done yet. I get it, the bussers have to really haul ass to make way for new customers, but your heart sinks when you return to your clean table. Once they took it to the extreme and put our coats and books in the lost and found. We're never gone for more than a minute or two, I swear.\n\nWe usually go to the kind of place that gives out crayons and an activity sheet for kids. I learned to make a sign with 2-inch letters in crayon that says \"WE WILL BE BACK\". This usually works.\n\nWe just sit back down at the table, the wait person comes back, apologizes, and brings us the full check. It hasn't occurred once yet to a waitperson that I shouldn't be compensated somehow for this. I politely tell the waitperson, then the manager, \"I'm sorry, my food got taken away and I don't want to pay for it\". They offer to make our meal again, but at that point, we're not really hungry anymore, a little bit pissed off, and just want to go on with our fun day. I ask that the entrees be wiped off the bill and they always seem happy to go with that. I still tip the wait person as though we ate well, because she still did all the work, and we split amicably. I even come back as a repeat customer.\n\nThe last time this happened, the young manager tried to paint it as though it were my fault. He tried to man-splain shit to me (a man, 10 years older than him) about how I never should have left the table unattended. He suggests that when I come back, I can leave my smartphone on the table while I go to signal that someone is still there. I hadn't gotten my compensation yet, so I didn't tell him \"When I come back, maybe I can call you over to my table, and you can leave YOUR smartphone on my table while we all walk away in this crowded-ass restaurant.\"\n\nA tip for those who leave the table unoccupied when they go to the bathroom: sometimes you'll be surprised at what places don't give you crayons and an activity sheet. Take a pre-made sign, sharpie on printer paper with you to let people know \"DON'T TAKE MY FUCKING FOOD!\"\n\nedited to add: letting the waitperson know we're going potty in a larger establishment has been tried and does not work.

As he was walking back over I said something like kids, man.

I was the third person in line, and the guy behind the counter knows everybody so he was talking to the guy in front.  When the guy in front left, the land whale in front of me stomps up to the counter and says, “I can’t fucking believe that you made me wait that long. Give me two pouches of rolling tobacco. Do you have any idea how long I’ve been waiting?!” To which the guy says, “Come on, you weren’t waiting that long.” “You’re fucking rude, I can’t believe you. I’m coming back to talk to your manager, faggot.” Me, being the smart ass that I am told the lady to get the fuck out of the way, you’re holding up the line. The cashier pushes the tobacco across the counter and tells her, “get the fuck out.” She glares at us and stomps out of the store. Me and the guy busted up laughing, fist bumps and the like. He thanked me for backing him up. It’s surprising how often people are unnecessarily rude to cashiers, I don’t understand how someone can think that buying two baggies of tobacco makes them the most important person on earth.",

I’ve never heard what temperature for how do I want a piece of meat done. So this temperature question goes over my head, thinking this lady was asking me if I want a luke-warm burger or something, and I answer:\n\n“.....hot(?)”\n\nAnd she goes off and it was something along the lines of:\n\n “oh, you aren’t original, hoW MANY TIMES DO YOU THINK I HEAR THAT ONE, BLAH BLAH BLA”\n\nAt some point I start blocking it out because I’m just sitting there frozen, ‘cause I had no damn clue what she was talking about but mentally I was like “wHaaaAAAAaaat ThE FuuUUcCck”and screaming on the inside. \n\nAnd by this time my grandma was on a call, but watching this and my grandpa just thinks it’s hilarious and answers at the end of her rant, “she (me) probably wants it well.” \n\nAnd once my grandma gets off her call and the waitress walks away I lean over and I’m like, “dang, y’all couldn’t have helped a sister out and answered sometime between that pause that she meant how I want it done??” And they laugh at me all over again and my grandpa answers she thought I was being a smart ass, but I wasn’t tho that was my serious answer to HER question. \n\nThis happened a week or two ago and I finally bring that up to my mom and step dad since we’re all at the same place for vacation and my grandparents retell the story laughing even harder about how I was “serious as a heart attack” when I answered hot and then the lady went off on me.\n\nI’m still pissed, I wish I would have stood up for myself.

The process is that you go through three “rounds” of rush, the further into the rounds you go, usually the less people rush, and you finally pledge in February. \n\nI tried out the rush process my sophomore year of college and I never joined anything (long story with too much sorority drama) but I remember I went to a first round with this one sorority, I’ll call them XYZ. At this time XYZ sorority had a reputation of being full of book smart girls but overpriveleged, rich, not so street smart women. I only rushed because a girl I was really close friends with at the time was in it and convinced me to try out their “first round.” (She didn’t even show up for this event anyway.)\n\nXYZ’s first round every year was to gather all the interested girls, tell them to show up in pajamas around 10 pm and carpool everyone to a very well known pancake establishment. Rush events usually happened on Thursdays, so it wasn’t even a weekend where extra service was expected. \n\nThis was a tradition EVERY year, but turns out, these super smart, perfect girls would NEVER call ahead of time to warn the restaurant that about 30-50 potential sorority girls would be showing up around 10:30 pm for pancakes. There was one sweet lady working as a waitress and the hostess that night and I felt terrible, because if I had known they didn’t call ahead I would have. \n\nLater the girls in the sorority were making rounds and talking to us (mostly to scope us out) and these two girls came up to us and started talking. \nI remember they basically said something like “we knew it would get this busy and we wouldn’t get our order in time so we drove over ahead of time and ate.” And I remember my friend and I were so confused. I basically went “if you knew it would get this crowded why didn’t you at least warn the restaurant while you were here earlier?” Didn’t really get a real answer to that. \n\nAs soon as we got back to campus my friend and I immediately took our names off their “interested” list. I really hope they learn to call ahead or maybe I would do it myself his year because that was honestly one of the messiest dinners I’ve been to.",

        "text": "Just want to share my travel story from about a month ago and how 3 random acts of kindness from 3 strangers turned my disastrous situation around. \n\nI was travelling from my home in the United States to a foreign country. I drove towards an airport that was a few hours away from me. I needed to get gas along the way (I drive a gas hog that gives me poor miles per gallon); the fact that I needed to get gas (or petrol, for you Europeans) is going to loom large later on in the story. \n\nAfter I got gas, it was the last time I used my wallet. Before I got to the airport, I made a stop at a coffee shop where I paid with my phone. There were some suspicious characters/homeless type in the store and one was behind me. I was wearing special work pants that had extra pockets on the outside of my thigh, like cargo pants. My wallet was in the pocket on my right thigh and my passport and foreign currency was in the pocket on my left thigh. It looks like my wallet was stolen right then because I didn’t have to use my wallet until I got to my destination and yes, things don’t fall out of my work pants. I’ve been wearing these pants for years now and I know the pants really well. \n\nAfter my 5-hr flight, I landed at my destination. I arrived at my hotel and the front desk lady asked to see a credit card to cover for incidentals. That was when I realized I no longer had my wallet. As I was panicking over my lost wallet which contained all my credit cards, debit card, and U.S. driver’s license, the front desk lady was very understanding and accommodating. \n\nShe gave me free WiFi access (that hotel charged for WiFi) and let me get checked into the room to make phone calls and rest up a little bit with a deposit of a small amount of my limited amount of cash in that country’s currency. That was kind act #1. I tipped her the equivalent of $5 American dollars before I checked out the hotel. \n\nAs I called my credit card companies and banks, yes, there had been some fraudulent activities on my credit cards in the town of that coffee shop I was last at in the United States. \n\nI then called the airline to explain my situation – I had no credit cards and basically no money and I needed to get back home to the United States ASAP. The agent was very understanding and accommodating yet again. As I arrived in the foreign country on a Friday late in the afternoon, he was able to get me on the earliest flight back the next morning at 6am (Saturday morning). He charged me no changing fees. Kind act #2\n\nSo in a foreign city, thankfully I still had some cash to get food and rest up for the night before flying back to the States first thing next morning. However, I had one more problem: I needed parking money to get my car out from the airport garage and gas money to drive home once I’m back in the US. With my limited cash in the foreign currency, even after exchanging it back to US dollars, that was not enough. Uber was not an option not just because of the distance between my home and the US airport I flew out of, but also all my credit cards were now deactivated. \n\nWith no debit cards or credit cards, I needed a kind soul to be willing to give me some cash and I can then Venmo or wire him/her money with my phone. The guy who sat next to me on the plane turned out to be my savior. As we chatted on the plane, I told him about what had happened to me. \n\nOnce we got our luggage at the airport, I asked him for the favor. With no hesitation, he gave me $40; when combined with the money I exchanged at the airport, that was enough to get my car out of the parking garage and the gas money to get me home. As I insisted on Venmo’ing the man, he insisted back saying that it’s okay, things like this happen when one is travelling, and just “pay it forward.” \n\nAs we hugged and then shook hands, the amount of thankfulness and gratefulness was indescribable. As a fairly well-to-do man, I had never felt so helpless in my life. Yet, I encountered 3 kind people who helped me to get home safely. \n\nMaybe it’s the karma I’ve built over the past 10+ years by helping and volunteering for the underserved. I am still and forever will be thankful for these individuals (Jess, Todd, and Dan). I am also thankful that I still had my cell phone and my passport and cash in the foreign currency. I will continue to pay it forward! ",

We were driving back from my community band’s concert and had been to the restaurant in another state so we wanted to check out this one. \n\nWe get sat and we notice almost all of the tables in this part of the restaurant are full, which is surprising for so late on a Saturday. Then we notice that there’s only two servers for this whole section, which amounts to about 14-15 tables. We found that very unusual. \n\nAfter several minutes, our waiter finally stopped to say hi and get our drink orders. We asked him how many tables he had, and he said that he had 7. 7 FULL TABLES. That’s absolutely insane! He looked exhausted and we felt so sorry for him, so we wanted to make his job as easy as possible. Both my husband and I worked in the restaurant industry at one point in time (my husband was a server and manager and I worked in customer service and drive-thru) so we knew how we could make his job easier. \n\nWe even told him that we used to work in the industry so we felt bad for him, and he seemed relieved that we understood why he was running around like a chicken with his head cut off. He was very busy but he still gave us extra salsa and chips and stuff. \n\nWe are quickly and we cleaned up after ourselves (stacked our plates and wiped up some salsa we had accidentally spilled) because again, we wanted to help him out. He gave us the check and it was $24, so we decided to tip him $20. I hope it made his night better. ",

        "text": "I could more so use advice. I'm the customer..\n\nI hired a local contractor to do some work on the outside of my house. What should have taken one day, has now taken at least two. That does not bother me so much, what bothers me is that they started in mid May and still have not finished. It is not because they are at my house every day working and just moving very slowly, it is because the contractor and his workers have been to my house only twice, and on the second time they were on site they found some things that they wish to try and upsell me on. I budgeted for this project and I'm not looking to spend extra money on other things at this time. Because they had nearly finished the project and literally just have one step remaining, that will take a total of an hour to do, I gave them the check and expected to see them back. In fact, they left all of their equipment in my backyard. It has been there for over a month. I have reached out multiple times and keep getting told that they are coming tomorrow, or the following day, or the following weekend. Of course they never show up.\n\nI'm very frustrated, and that's why I'm sharing. I'm asking for advice. I don't want to make it a legal matter. I really just want some advice on how to encourage them to come back and finish. I learned that I should not have paid, but having very large and expensive equipment in someone's yard would seem to be an incentive. I have no intention of even touching the stuff, but if it were stolen it would be their loss. I can't imagine leaving thousands of dollars worth of stuff sitting outside someone's house for an extended period of time for a project that would take minutes to an hour to do. Why take the risk? Not to mention the fact that the longer it takes to get done the understandably angrier a client would become.\n\nOn one hand, I feel bad because they are new to being independent contractors and I truthfully believe they are struggling at moving through projects. But on the other: finish the project!! It should have been finished in May! I havent seen anyone since mid June.",

So i'm young...ish looking I guess. I don't know, I guess what I'm trying to say is that a lot of people don't think I \"look\" like a responsible business owner, which - okay - I mean I work with a lot of corporate offices so I get it and dress accordingly when I need to, but this lady was just next level weird. \n\nSo i'm at the greenhouse that I get my wholesale plants from, looking around and adding stuff onto my cart. It's super hot outside, so you know it's going to be a friggin sauna in the greenhouse, so i'm wearing a tank top and shorts. I'm not doing anything labor intensive or anything, I definitely looked like I was browsing their selection. An older lady walks into the front area where I am and immediately looks me up and down with a bit of disdain. Whatever, kind of used to it at this point, I keep doing my thing. She then proceeds to look around, trying to find somebody to help her I assume. This place is a huge wholesale greenhouse and they had just received a shipment so everybody was down by receiving, not at the front area. After looking around for a minute she hesitantly walks over to where I am and initiates conversation across from one of the tables where I'm picking my plants. No intro, no nice \"hello\" just a very annoyed \"I am looking to by some succulents and I-\" \n\nI cut her off pretty quickly, I didn't have time to wait for her obviously-bummed-she-had-to-talk-to-me whole spiel and frankly I was already kind of irked by her, so I just smiled and said \"oh i don't work here sorry\" . Even though I owed this lady nothing and I was a customer just like her, I made sure to use my super 'customer service' voice so she didn't get even more weird, which might have been a mistake.  \n\nthis lady looks at me, clearly insulted and scoffs\n\n\"oh, you don't \\*work\\* here?\" \n\n\"you just.....shooop here.\" She says the word 'shop' with a smile, and then just continues to stand there, like i was going to confess it was all a lie and i really did work there? it was really bizarre are totally uncomfortable. She was just expectantly staring, and continued to do so. \n\nI ended up walking to a different section because I was so fucking weirded out. I don't know. it just really bugged me and made me feel really out of place in a greenhouse that i'm usually totally comfortable in. \n\n\\*\\*Unrelated! - Also, for those of you who read my parking garage scam experience, I'm working on it still.  The app I used refunded my money but I haven't taken any legal action yet because I wanted to make sure my money came back before I did anything else. I'll update though soon.\\*\\* ",

I am an 18 year old female and I really like changing my hair color (v important). \n\nMy ID photo is my with my natural dark brown hair, from 2 years ago, when I passed my test. Now, my hair is blonde and longer than my photo. \n\nAnyways, I go in, ask for my mango pods and he asks for my ID. \"That's odd\" I think, but I give it to him and I can tell he doesn't think it's me. I calmly explain that the picture was taken 2 years ago when I got the ID so I look different due to aging and hair color. He doesn't believe me. He has a very heavy Indian accent and asks for my \"Good name.\" I recite my full name and DOB. He says \"Yeah, I know, but this isn't you\" and my heart fucking sinks. He starts to yell at me saying shit like \"This is a fake ID\", \"I'm gonna call the cops\",  etc. I, being young and tired, kinda snap at him and raise my voice \"This ID is real, that is my name, my face, and this is the date I have to renew my license.\" \n\nThis old, bitch-ass man yells at me louder, telling me I can't raise my voice at him. I apologize. I ask for my ID back so I can drive home. He says he's going to confiscate it. I say \"No, give it back to me, scan it, or call the police. That is MY REAL ID and i need it to drive home.\"\n\nHe says \"I'm not a dumbass, I've taken many fake IDs over the past 20 years, this is fake.\" I respond with a \"Well you must fucking suck at your job, because that is a real ID, sir\"\n\nAfter a bit more arguing a guy tells the cashier to just give my the ID back. The other customer said \"She asked you to call the police, there's no way it's a fake ID.\"\n\nThat is how I, IcedAlmondMilk, almost got my real ID confiscated because a cashier was too fucking stupid to scan it. \n\nEDIT: This story had nothing to do with the cashiers race? I don't know why I got a couple messages saying the fact I mentioned his thick accent is racist. The ONLY reason I mentioned his heavy Indian accent is because it described the situation. I wasn't able to understand him that well because of the accent. This story wasn't calling Indian people stupid, I said this MAN got on my nerves and accused me of illegal activity even though I wasn't doing anything bad. This is not a fucking race thing.

        "text": "I was reading reviews on an Italian Restaurant, when this comes up\n\n\n“lives in Daytona Beach, and when deciding where to go for dinner, he suggested (Restaurant) as a place he had been wanting to try. We arrived between 6 and 6:30pm, and when we walked in, half the tables and booths had hand printed signs on them saying \"Reserved.\" A young gentleman (owner's son perhaps?) cleared a booth for us and gave us menus. Quite a few choices on the menu. \n\n\nHowever, to me the restaurant looked like it might have been a former pizza joint that was trying to expand. Everything looked old and in need of some refreshing. Another gentleman (perhaps the owner?) who had been chatting with some of the other tables, came up to us to take our order. I asked for unsweetened iced tea, and was told that they did not have iced tea at all. First restaurant I have ever been in (especially in Florida) that didn't offer iced tea. I settled for the fruit punch. My boyfriend ordered the lobster ravioli, and when he asked for meat sauce, was told that that was an additional charge. \n\n\nI ordered the oil and garlic linguine, and a side salad with Italian dressing (which I was told was the house dressing). After waiting some time, the waiter brought our plates of food, but I never received my salad. When I mentioned that to the waiter, he said the food came out so fast there wasn't a chance to get me my salad. That was certainly not correct since it was a good while before the pasta was served to us. The waiter asked if I still wanted a salad and I said no. He then walked away, and I had to call him back to request parmesan cheese for my pasta. The waiter brought a glass shaker container of parmesan cheese for me. \n\n\nMy dinner was ok - not much garlic and heavy on the oil (it was actually pooling on the bottom of the plate). My boyfriend ate his lobster ravioli, but indicated he couldn't taste any lobster in it - it was more like cheese ravioli with meat sauce. The bill came up to $35 for his ravioli, my linguine and two nonalcoholic drinks. With the lack of atmosphere, mediocre food and expense for the mediocre food, neither of us will be eating at this restaurant again.”\n\n\n\n\nThe management responded with this:\n\n\n\n\n“My Dearest Carol C and boyfriend – Let me dispense with my normally humerus reply's and attempt to address your comments which are almost identical to the recent Facebook comments made by your boyfriend. We regret and apologize,[1] for your disappointment due to NO TEA being offered. I can assure you our Lobster Ravioli contains an appropriate amount of lobster UNLESS you were expecting a lobster claw in each ravioli. \n\n\nWe normally serve, and strongly suggest, the ravioli to be served with our lighter Spinach Ala Vodka sauce but, your boyfriend wanted it served differently. When you cover the very light ravioli's with thick marinara with garlicky seasoned beef added, the lobster taste should be expected to be overwhelmed. Your choice!! YOU did indicate YOUR meal was OK? Not a major endorsement but acceptable. One would think that you wouldn't seem surprised that adding meat to a dish costs very slightly more? \n\n\nNot promptly getting your salad was an oversight which WE APOLOGIZED FOR. You declined the salad at that point and I don't know what you would have us to do beyond that? Calling the waiter back for Parmesan cheese doesn't seem like a major inconvenience? BUT? Moving on - Your apparent dissatisfaction with the prices and the atmosphere are a bit surprising because these things should be immediately apparent? My suggestion to you would be as follows for future visits ANYWHERE. If you are disenchanted with the atmosphere upon arrival – turn around and leave. \n\n\nIf you look at prices prior to dining and they seem high, turn around and leave. If adding an additional item is expected to be free, despite being advised of the very slight additional cost, don't be surprised. A bill of $35.00 for two,[2], folks – two entrees - additional meat - breaks down to $15.25 each entree - plus 2 sodas $4.50. As Information, Most of our customers LOVE the atmosphere and the food. WE interact with all and LOVE MOST of our guests who become part of our extended family. 91% of our guests have rated us #4 or #5 stars so we must be doing something right and do not plan any changes in the very near future. \n\n\nAbraham Lincoln was quoted as saying “You can please some of the people some of the time BUT, not all of the people all of the time” I can assure you we DO NOT like to disappoint anyone - EVER!! Your declination to return is probably best for both of us because I don't think we could please you. We wish you well in your endeavors. Go in Peace and May the Force be With You!!! Barbara C., Owner of that restaurant with the EXPENSIVE, MADIOCRE food - and LACK of atmosphere where we forget to deliver salads!! Arrivederci!!”",

        "text": "So I brought my brand new vehicle (8 months old; \\~7,000 miles) if for it's first oil change and tire rotation at a dealership that sells this vehicle, though it was not the one I purchased it from. I was initially told this work would take an hour. However, after two hours went by, I was approached by ones of the service managers. She informed me that the mechanic broken one of the locking wheel nuts and it would take a few more hours to get it off. Apparently, he tried to get if off with an impact gun, which you should never do. I told her that was fine, accidents happen, but I needed a loaner to get me to work since I had a meeting that day. She told me they couldn't get me a loaner, but someone from the dealership would drive me to work. I told her that was fine. So the guy brings me to work (nice guy, by the way) and all is well. I made it to my meeting. \n\nThen it all starts to go wrong. \n\nAbout an hour after getting to work, I get a call from the same service manager. Apparently, they would have to keep my vehicle overnight because they would have to drop the rear axle and hammer the wheel off. Now I'm getting concerned and frustrated. I told her that was fine but I really needed a loaner and would like to come see my vehicle before they did that work. She told me that they would have a loaner to me when I got off at 5:00 PM and that I could definitely come by and look at it. So the day goes on, I'm worried about my vehicle, and frustrated that this simple service is turning into a multi-day project. So I get the loaner and drive to the dealership. First of all, my vehicle is not sitting in a mechanic bay, but in front of the dealership. Second of all, there are chunks of metal missing from my wheel. The mechanic told me that they tried to hammer and chisel the broken pieces off the stud. As a car guy, I almost cried. Third of all, the mechanic hands me the piece of the locking nut that did break off and says, \"Did you want to keep this as a souvenir?\" I played it off as a joke, but I almost blew up in her face for thinking this was something to laugh about. But I kept calm and left the dealership.\n\nThe next day, I get a call from the service department. It was the guy that drove me to work. Says they got the wheel off, but are ordering me a new wheel (that they are paying for) because they damaged the original one. They said it would it be in and installed on Saturday (today). \n\nFirst phone call I get this morning is from the service manager, \"Hey. We've had more issues. We broke an axle seal and it'll be here and installed Wednesday. We are sorry for these issues.\" I tell her that's fine and we hang up. Well now I'm furious. So I left a review/warning on a private page of fellow owners of the same vehicle telling them what has happened and that the mechanics were incompetent.\n\nI get a call an hour later from the head service manager requesting that I take it down because I was \"slandering\" the dealership after they have gone \"above and beyond\" what is expected by giving me a loaner and paying for the new parts (that they broke). I was civil and I told her that I did not appreciate her calling me about this and that I would not take down the post until I reviewed the work done on my vehicle, and that I might not take it down because it's the truth.\n\nSo not only have they damaged my vehicle, but they have harassed me about a poor review. But now I'm worried I can be sued about calling them incompetent. \n\nTL;DR: mechanics broke my vehicle, I left a bad review, the service department called me, and now I don't know what to do.\n\nUPDATE: Sorry it took so long for this. I’ve been crazy busy at work and at home. I, of course, got my vehicle back 2 days after I made this post. All service was free of charge. However, the receipt they gave me at the dealership wasn’t the one with all the work listed on it. They said they would email that one to me. I received the email right as the clock hit 6:00 PM (the time the service department closes) and they had apparently broke my brake lines as well. I did a little shakedown drive with it to make sure nothing was rattling. Did an inspection and everything is tight and right. ",

        "text": "Just add all the acronyms\n\nSo our journey starts out in November. We got a notification that fibre gigabit internet was available in our area.  The company was Porkopolis Bell (only people from my area would understand.).  We were currently using rectum as our ISP, and plate as our cable TV provider.  At this point Rectum was meh at best, so we decided to switch both to Porkopolis Bell.  We set up a appointment with them, and they determined that we needed a new fibre line from the street.  We agreed and they said they would install it in a few days.  We cancelled our Rectum internet, which was a huge mistake.  The  install day comes, and no one shows up.  No communication at all.   We called them and had to deal with the automated computer thing, as we didn’t have a account set up yet.  When we finally got through to the agent, they said that it was supposed to be done and the contractor didn’t notify them of the cancellation.  We set up another installation for the next day, same thing happens.  When we called them now, they said that we needed to wait 14 days for the install, which is way too long.  At school, because everything is “modern” we need internet for homework.  The teachers thought I was lying when i said i didn’t have internet, and called my parents to confirm it.  We have been without internet for a month now.  The contractor finally shows up.  It didn’t look professional at all, they just had shovels.  They “finish”, and the person who sets up the router and other stuff arrives.  After a whole afternoon of troubleshooting, he determines that they messed up the fibre installation.  Side note, they also broke the “visible fence” wire loop, which they did not compensate us for.  We had a nice long phone call with the representative, and promised the correct install would be in a day.  As you might expect, no one shows up.  We called them and explained due to the lack of service, we would cancel.  We reverted to rectum.  \n\nThe bad fibre installation probably hurt the contractor financially,  We live on a private drive that is a few hundred yards away from the street. After this, we actually looked in the corrupt business bureau, and they had a “A+” rating. Yet they have hundreds of unresolved complaints, and only 1 out of  50 or so positive reviews.  So honestly I don’t know what i was expecting.  Morale of the story, wait for google fibre, or take gigabit internet offeres with a grain of salt.",

All I could find was the “extreme” upgrade. Could never find a upload/download number of Mbs to see what I should approximately be getting. I found was ads for new customers advertising 100mbs a second. So I decided to do some speed tests. I used theirs, Ookla and couple other sites. Theirs- 78mbs, Ookla- 4mbs, other sites varied from 1mbs to 15mbs. \n\nI gave them a call and they decided that the best thing to do was reset my modem. They said it would take about 30minutes to take effect and to reset my router after the 30 minutes. I did as they said and my internet was gone, 1 hour.... 2 hours... gave em a call again. Repeated almost verbatim what I heard before. Asked to speak with a superior and was placed on hold for 45 minutes. The superior said that they would turn my internet back on(why in the holy name of fuck was it turned off???) and send a tech out the next day. \n\nNow my internet hasn’t been working for about 37 hours, I never saw or heard from a tech all day (which I stayed up for as I work nights) if I don’t see one tomorrow I’ll call again. I wish I could use a different provider but they’re the only one available in my area. \n\nNever did find out what speed I’m paying for every month. ",

        "text": "Sorry but this is going to be a long one.\n\nI was meeting a friend for lunch at the weekend and I was really excited to see her as we had quite a bit of catching up to do. I suggested we go to this little authentic Indian restaurant that is usually jam packed for dinner but not so busy for lunch. On entering we could see there was one couple in the whole restaurant...  now this restaurant could fit about 50 people but the waiter/host led us to a table in the back that was RIGHT next to where the waitstaff come out with the food, where waiters come up and yell orders to the cooks, etc. Not fancying being hit in the back of the chair with the kitchen door all day I politely asked, “Could we possibly sit over there?” and point to a booth right next to the window (totally empty), bathed in sunlight, pretty much with birds singing in the background. The guy deadpan looked at the booth, back at me, back at the table, then gestured in that universal “do what you want” sign and stomped away. \n\nSeemed a little weird but whatever, we got the nice booth!\n\nWe sit, get our drinks, then order a lot of food (£30 worth at lunch time!) planning to settle down to a long girly chat about life and boys and work gripes. Very quickly the food comes out and the waiter asked me if I wanted another drink, which seemed weird as my glass was still half full. I politely declined and, again, he didn’t say a word but turned and stomped away. So far he hasn’t said a pleasant word to us and has had the same scowl painted on his face since we walked in the door. Anyway we devour the main plates in 2 minutes flat and then get to chatting and lingering over some shared plates. \n\nNot even 5 minutes later the waiter pops up and asks again if I want a drink. I tell him no. Again. I’m starting to feel the pressure to order again but I haven’t touched my drink and I’m not having an extra sitting on the table and getting cold! Without saying a word (not asking ya how the food was etc) ge then starts to clear up the plates... I thought he was just tidying the table until I saw him reach for plates that still had food on them and dump them on the empty plates. We had been in the restaurant less than 20 minutes at this point! He is dumping chicken, sweet potato and black lentils, some really good stuff!! At this point I decide I need to say something, but am also in shock so what comes out is a weak “Sorry, can you leave those ones please?” and I shakily pointed at the two plates left. The waiter didn’t even acknowledge me. He just dropped the plates like they were suddenly burning his hand and stalked away without a word. My friend and I are just staring at each other now. Was this guy mute except for the one phrase, “You want another drink?” \n\n“Maybe we should leave?” my friend said.\n\nA few minutes later guess who came back! And threw the check down on the table with a smug smile. We’d been in the restaurant less than 30 minutes and it was STILL EMPTY. We had food on the table and drinks. By now I’d worked myself up into a bit of a rage. I thought I wasn’t going to pay the bill, no sir, not until I had my girly chat and black lentils and I was NOT going to order another drink. \n\nBut then, seeing I wasn’t picking up the check, this waiter pulls out a card machine, types in the amount, swivels the automatic tip to 20% (normally 10% in the UK) and tries to hand it to me while I am pointedly not taking it. My friend is visibly dying from the awkwardness so she suggests we just pay, leave, and go somewhere else to chat. I’m now seeing red because my friend wants to go to avoid confrontation, and I want her to be happy, but this asshole wants me to leave because he didn’t get enough attention as a child, and I want him to suffer. So I do the only thing I can. I grab the card machine, quickly swivel the tip to as low as it will go (5%), and hit enter. Then I hand it back with a smile. Now I forgot to mention, this place is pretty cheap price wise so I don’t think there is money in their margins for paying their waitstaff exceedingly well, so they rely on tips. \n\nWe down the black lentils and grab our purses ready to go. As we are leaving I hear running footsteps behind me, the sound of a card machine being shaken in the air, and a heavily Indian accented voice yelling “Hey, you should give at least 10%!” I turn around and say, “You should give customers time to eat.”\n\nGreedy bastard.\n\nTLDR: Just read it.\n\n",

Please excuse formatting, spelling, etc. I’m on mobile.\n\nThe beautiful cable company that many of know and love, rhymes with Rectum, which I feel speaks to how I feel of this company right now, came to install my service on Tuesday this week. Nice duo of people, the inside looks pretty good. I was happy with their service. That is h til I went outside and I see a BIG HONKING white cable going over the peak of my house with a black roof. Right up the middle, over the peak, down the other side.\n\nI call this wonderful company and tell them I am displeased with the installation. The wonderful lady on the phone more or less said \n\n“ I have no explanation for that, it’s completely unprofessional”, again wonderful lady. Anyways, she gives me something like an urgent ticket, she says they will be here between 8am - 5pm. That’s fine, I guess I’ll just take the day off work and continue fixing the new house up. \n\nSurprise, no one shows up. I get on the good ol’ cellular device and give them a call again. Different lady and she really seems like she doesn’t want to be talking to me, oh well.\n\n“Sir the ticket is closed and is marked as ‘Customer satisfied’”\n\nUfuckinwot?\n\nI explain I am most certainly NOT satisfied with this and I tell her this is unacceptable. She agrees, neat. I’m transferred again, this time some guy. I explain again what happened. \n\nGuy - “Sir I will open another urgent ticket and we will get you in sometime within the next 7-10 business days”\n\nMe - “ that’s unacceptable, I’m not waiting that long for this to be fixed” (I’m more just pissed at this point)\n\nGuy - “ yeah you know actually I can fit you in tomorrow” (why didn’t you just tell me that the first time?)\n\nSo, today arrives. Again, 8-5 waiting period. 3 days of missed work now, 2 unscheduled. Very upset about this, I’m losing 3 days of pay for what should have been 1. \n\nAgain, no show. \n\nCurrently on the phone and will update with what comes of this...\n\nUpdate: \nThey will be coming out again, she said tomorrow. Luckily I don’t need to take off of work.\n\nI was also comped $40 for my troubles... I guess that totally makes up for the 3 days of missed pay...\n\nUpdate edit: forgot to put in last night, they say the ticket was resolved again yesterday and that is why they did not show up! \n\nI’m wondering if it’s the same guy all 3 days not wanting to own his mistake ",

        "text": "I went into a new nationwide chain pet store last week that just opened up. I was excited because I like this store and happy that a new one opened up near me. I went in with my dog to specifically buy a new harness. Initially, I couldn't find the specific kind I was looking for. I look around and there are absolutely no one on the floor but the cashier. There are not a lot of other customers either, approximately 5. So I go up to the cashier and ask for assistance from the cashier and she calls someone over the intercom. I wait over 15 minutes with a dog and I'm just tired and hot and just got annoyed that no one came. So instead of being that middle age woman who complains about stuff, I bought some other stuff and called it a day. I got an email receipt that asked to rate my experience. So I put in the note that we waited for 15 minutes after requesting assistance and no one came. To my surprise, the assistant store manager sent me an email directly with response to come back to the store, here is a $10 credit, just ask for him. \"Oh, well that was cool. I didn't expect that.\" is what I told myself. I went in yesterday and decided to try the harness thing again. Again, no one came to help. Lovely. So I decided to ask for the assistant manager in that email and ask for him to help me with the harness. He comes out 15 minutes later extremely pissed off that I asked for him by name and had the biggest attitude in the entire world in trying to help me. My super friendly dog wouldn't go near him. He kept hiding behind my legs. Not a good sign from my dog. Also, he's a little (fat) Chihuahua. So I am trying to figure if the harness could fit him and the assistant manager just bolts off without any explanation or excusing himself. Thinking he's going to come back, he never does. So I am struggling too hard with the unique harness and I decide to buy another one. I get up to the cashier, tell him about the credit from the assistant manager, and he has to call him to get the special code. We wait for another 20 minutes and there were no responses. The store had no customers in it the entire time I'm there. Finally, I just apologize to the cashier for hanging out with him so long and thank him and just leave with no attitude or storming off. I chalked this up to just a bad manager and call it a day. I think nothing of it. Today, I wake up to an email from the assistant manager asking me to come back in for my $10 credit. There was no apology. No explanation why I waited so long for him during a part of the day where there were NO CUSTOMERS in the store. Look, if he would have said \"I felt sick and had to run to the restroom.\" I could have been understanding. But there was nothing. I responded with a \"No thank you.\" and that was it. I did not even put an explanation of how much waiting I did or complain about a single thing from my encounter yesterday. That was 2 hours ago. Now, I'm getting emails from their corporate office trying to \"resolve the issue with the store assistant manager.\" I haven't answered any of them and it feels super awkward. First, I really don't want to spend any energy on this with the store. Second, it's putting me in a position where I feel uncomfortable. I'm not that type of customer that goes hardcore in the complaint department where I am screaming, yelling, or demanding some type of justice and entitlement. I don't even understand how this is spiraling. ",

Makes me want to dab my eyes with a &lt;famous brand facial tissue&gt;. \n\nOk, this happened almost 30 years ago, but now is as good a time as any to tell. \n\nWhen my wife &amp; I first married, we received two &lt;famous brand&gt; food processors as wedding gifts. We didn't need two, so one went back to the store for a refund to our credit card (let's say $200, I don't recall the exact amount). \n\nThe next month, on our credit card bill, we realized they had debited us $200 instead of crediting us $200. So, back to store with all our receipts.\n\nThe very nice salesman immediately saw the error and credited our credit card for $200. Here's where things went sideways:\n\nUs: \"Gee, that's great, but you still owe us $200.\"\n\nSalesman: \"What kind of scam is this. The food processor costs $200, I credited you $200. Why should I refund another $200?\"\n\nUs: \"Look at it this way: We started with a food processor. You took our food processor, debited us $200, and now credited us $200. So now we have the same amount of money as before, but no food processor. Either give us $200 or give us a food processor.\"\n\nThis went round and round for about 30 minutes as we tried in vain to convince the salesman that this wasn't some gypsy con scheme. Eventually we prevailed (I'm not sure we really convinced him, or just wore him down). ",

I don’t mind waiting for them to finish talking because I’m not in a rush.\n\nWhen they finish up and it’s my turn to check out the cashier’s mood instantly shifted. She didn’t even greet me or acknowledge me, just stared at me blankly and rang me up. I finish up with my card at the machine and all my groceries are bagged up. So I’m standing there for a solid 2 minutes waiting for my receipt all while the cashier is just staring at me and staring at me. I politely ask for my receipt and she instantly snapped at me “I’m waiting for it!!! I can’t make the machine go any faster!!!” and waved her hands in my face.\n\nI was totally shocked and said “I’m sorry you haven’t said a word to me this entire transaction, I didn’t know it was running slow”. She then audibly laughed at me and rolled her eyes. Finally the receipt prints and she hands it to me wordlessly then turns and is bright and cheery with the next customer.\n\nIt was so strange, I don’t know why this woman seemed to instantly not like me but was fine with everyone else. I was so taken aback I actually called the store later because I kept thinking about it. The manager I spoke to was nice and commented that Peggy my cashier seems to treat her regular customers a little better. He said he’d work on coaching her on customer service. Mind you the woman was easily in her late 50s, and I really think she should have the whole customer service thing down by now, especially when her job deals directly with the public.

I read the rules but no other subreddit fits with this story.\n\nTo start off with, I have never worked retail but I have worked in customer service and I know how to be a good human being and most of my friends were met through the retail/service industry. I love and have so much respect for you guys!\n\nThis literally just happened and I am SO LIVID!\n\nI just finished work and went to get some food at HomestyleChickenPlace so I entered the rope barriers and I was greeted by this very nice young Latina woman with a thick accent (this will come into play later) -- let's call her \"Angel\" (since she had the patience of a saint.).\n\nSo HomestyleChickenPlace, like many fast food places, requires their staff to promote their latest special.\n\nAngel: \"Hi I'm Angel would you like to try [our new special]?\"\n\nMe: \"Hi! Not today -- next time though! I promise!\"\n\nSo Angel and I are cruising towards the serving line. It's apparent this chain wants employees to upsell product - I decline poilitely both times. \n\nApparently while I was going through the serving line Red Old Asshole got on line behind me (ROA). \n\nSo, I'm waiting to pay my order and hear Angel doing her opening line promoting the new product and suddenly I hear this shrill, LOUD, voice.\n\nROA: THAT LOOKS DISGUSTING. I DON'T WANT THAT!\n\nSo I'm waiting to pay, minding my own business when suddenly I hear:\n\nROA: I DON'T WANT THAT CHICKEN BREAST! GET ME ANOTHER! \n\nAngel says something (I can't hear) and ROA, the gentleman, shouts (I couldn't hear Angel):\n\n\"I WANT CHICKEN POT PIE TOO! CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND?\" \n\n\"YES [I] WANT STRING BEANS! YOU CALLED THEM GREEN BEANS! THEY'RE STRING BEANS!\" \n\n\"WHAT DID YOU SAY? I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND YOU!\"\n\nIt's apparent that Angel is getting flustered and she's stuttering her words and since English is not her first langauge, was getting overwhelmed. \n\nWhat sent me over the edge the most was when Angel tried to upsell him an extra side for $x.xx. I kid not, this guy said in the loudest most shrillist voice I've ever heard in my life:\n\nROA: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!\n\nThat did it. I wish I could have confronted the guy directly, but he looked like he'd been drinking (red face) and I'm a lot younger and smaller than him (I'm also a girl). I finish paying and: \n\nMe: ANGEL! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL YOUR HELP TODAY! YOU WERE GREAT! (In the same loudness as ROA and in a bubbily and happy tone). \n\nI was so in the zone that I sidestepped ROA and actually went through the serving line in reverse! This other customer on line beamed at me and and let me through.\n\nBefore I exit the store though, I call over Angel  (Ironically, ROA had stopped screaming and was silently paying for his order)\n\nNote: I am fluent in Spanish even though I look like another ethnicity (biracial).\n\nMe (in Spanish): I'm so sorry about that rude man!\n\nAngel: (Startled at first) Laughs and smiles and looks at the ROA and does the brush off gesture to him.\n\nHope everyone enjoyed this! If anyone's interested, I have more stories!\n\nEdits: Typos, clarity",

The employee had never heard of these shelves or the brand but was happy to help look and so we set off with the item number to check the overheads. After a few minutes I manage to spot the item number on a pallet so I point it out to him and he goes off to find a spotter to get it down.\n\n 20 minutes later a different employee comes up to ask if I need anything and I tell him the story and who I'm waiting for. Welp another 20- 30 minutes go by and the original employee comes back and says he got sidetracked and had forgot about me! At this point he tells me he'll get me a good deal on it and I was thinking sweet! Another 10% off or something maybe. Nope he got the shelf down and wrote out a note to give the originally $115 shelf, on sale for 89, to me for $30. Needless to say I have no complaints about my experience today!\n\nAlso to note every employee I interacted with today complained about being understaffed so I do feel bad for the guy, he really didn't mean to forget me.\n\nTLDR. Go to buy shelf, get forgotten. Get 115 dollar shelf for 30.",

I like to order pick up and on this particular evening, I went with a burger and onion rings.  Onion rings are additional, no problem.  I pick up my order and check it at the counter.  The first burger with fries is prepped normal.  The second burger, mine, with onion rings, is a bit short.  As in three half dollar sized rings…. That’s it…. Three measly fucking tiny ass onion rings.  I take a breath, conjure a smile and an ounce of patience, and ask to please get a full order of onion rings as I seem to be a bit short.  The waiter expressed zero surprise and disappeared into the depth of the kitchen.  I wait……  A few minutes later he reappears, sees me still waiting, and disappears into the kitchen again.  That’s when I hear what was actually going down with my onions rings…\n\nServer: Hey, where’s that onion ring order?\n\n…Muttering and shuffling…..\n\nServer: You ate them again?!  What the hell!  I told you not to touch these\n\nStaff #2: I was hungry!\n\nServer: But you ate the last ones too!\n\nStaff #2: I said I was sorry!\n\n……Cursing and mutter……\n\nServer reappears. “OK here is the rest of your order!”\n\nI’m presented with a small to-go box.  He quickly tries to disappear as I open the box and examine the three measly half dollar sized onions rings huddled together.  Our eyes meet over the pathetic offering…. I say nothing.  He sighs.  I sigh.  I leave…. This happens twice again at different points.  I have stopped ordering onion rings now.  It also happened with my quesadillas that accompany one of the salads.  That I nipped in the bud by playing dumb and asking every single time I order said salad “how many quesadillas come with that?”   \n\n Edit: descriptive terms. Fair enough Reddit, I'll retract \"snowflake millennial\".  Let us not apply an easy, negative stereotype.  To be more precise and descriptive; it appears that this establishment has a staff in the age range of 18 to 30.  Many elements (some out of the staff's control), such as training, decent pay, and proper management, and lack of experience have created an establishment whose service has frequently disappointment me.  \nAs a millenial, I am not insulted by this term but respect some are and I'll agree let's not box each other up so quickly",

It has a pear cut green sapphire in the middle surrounding by a diamond halo  and a diamond half-infinity band. I was (and still am) so in love with it. \n\nAnyway, after the event, I went to a local jewelry store to have it appraised for the insurance. I thought I would try and support small business rather than going to a chain. \n\nSo I walked in and the woman behind the counter, kind of older, just stared at me until I spoke. Now, I was not dressed like I could afford anything in the store. I had athletic-wear on because it was over 100° outside. So I finally spoke up “I was hoping to get my ring appraised for my insurance.” And she asked to see my ring. \n\nShe called for her husband, the owner, and he walked up and said “What’s the middle stone *supposed* to be?” Now I understand that blue and white sapphires are very common and other colors aren’t seen as much, but that was incredibly rude. So I told him what it was and he fumbled around with it for a minute and looked me dead in the eye and said “$80”\n\nColor me insulted. I very sharply said “excuse me?” To which he replied that an appraisal would be $80, and I’d have to leave my ring for a week because he was busy. NOPE. I demanded my ring back and left. \n\nAbout 6 months later, that shop went out of business because “millennials just don’t buy diamonds anymore.”  You’re right, asshole. We’re buying avocado toast. \n\nEdited to add: he didn’t tell me anything about the appraisal process until after I gave him a weird look when he said “$80”. Both me and my fiancé thought he was saying the value of my ring was $80. ",

An older woman enters the aisle at my end and starts to yell down the aisle to the employee \"Where can I find a trolley\" (Note that we rarely call shopping carts \"trolleys\" in the US and there was no indication she was not from the US by her accent). Of course because she was yelling all the way down an aisle and using an uncommon term, the employee was confused. She repeats herself a couple more times as she makes her way down the aisle and I end up inadvertently following her because the item i was looking for was down the aisle. I listen in on the conversion because at this point I am confused whether she wants a cart or is looking for some other type of item that this store probably sells that could be considered a trolley. The employee finally realizes she is looking for a cart and directs her to the front of the store where there are probably 300 carts right as you walk in. What the woman said next sure took me for a surprise. She says *\"That's strange, when did they start putting them there\"*. Maybe the store she normally shops at keeps them inconveniently in the back, you never know.",

No damage that I could see, but after that incident I could smell burning plastic every time I drove it. \n\nSo, I went online and made an appointment to have my TINI checked over early one morning. Having dealt with these folks before, I made sure I requested a loaner vehicle because they are not timely in the least (my last oil change took almost 4 hours) and I had to go to work. \n\nBecause my warranty covers my oil changes and a ton of other stuff, I put up with their shenanigans for the most part, but today I had a meeting to get to. \n\nI walk in. My “favorite” technician, a crusty grump we’ll call Tim, is on duty. \n\nWhen I let him know I’m here for service and hand him my keys, he directs me to go sit in the waiting area. He interrupts me when I start to mention the loaner and says he’ll speak to me when he finishes his paperwork. \n\n10 minutes later, a different guy (Tom?) comes out to verify what my visit was for and informs me that they gave the last of the loaners away mere minutes before.  \n\nLovely. So I asked if they could check it before I had to leave. I had almost two hours before my meeting. Tom says no can do, so I opted out right then and asked for my keys to be returned. \n\nAs we’re walking back to the front desk, Tom offers to make me a new appointment for the next day with a loaner request. I let him know that I had done exactly that online the night before and wasn’t happy with the results. That’s when this rage bomb dropped. \n\n“That’s just technology, baby!” Tom said with a smile. “You gotta call ahead next time.”\n\nWhat. \n\nAt this point the red was clouding my vision. I said something like, “maybe if that’s the way you operate you shouldn’t have those options on your website,” took my keys, and left to go to my job in the TECHNOLOGY field. \n\nHalfway to work I saw my car’s hood bobbing up and down in the wind. They never latched it. \n\nNeedless to say, I never ever went back and left a one star review on their webpage. \n\n",

        "text": "so im very annoyed at a phone company right now.\n\nive been using my cell phone hot spot to provide internet to my pc for around 8 months, no issues. suddenly i get a text message from my carrier saying i need to give them ten extra dollars a month to keep doing so or i will get my service suspended. i knew they had a hotspot option but i thought it was to make my phone do that if it didnt already. well i try to go into the app, and the website, and add the option in, and i cant. i call customer support - and they tell me that even though my phone already does the thing im trying to pay them for, they cant add the feature to my account. they literally wont take my money.\n\nnow im sure there is some good technical reason for it somewhere - but whatever it is that reason can (ends post before profanity ensues)\n\nUPDATE: so i made a stink on facebook - and the company actually replied and was going to fix my issue. but then, thanks to my -1/10 accounting skills, i found out i didnt have the ten dollars in my bank. told them this, and they have no stopped replying entirely, even after i have fixed my bank issue today, and am actually ready to give them my money. so now, i am also mad at myself.  \n\n\nUPDATE 2: ok, so now they are finally replying after me making another stink post on their page and my wife messaging them asking them to reply to me, and its more of the same. they tell me my phone isnt compatible, but if i dont stop using the thing my phone isnt compatible with, my service will be suspended. after arguing with someone over facebook messenger for like 10 mins theyre final excuse was that my phone doesnt have 2 APN bands so they cant track my hotspot usage - seems odd considering they sure do know when i hit my 22gb data cap to slow my speed down. but whatever i can find a company that actually wants my money i suppose.",

        "text": "Last night my husband and I went out to a chain restaurant that we love. Wine, appetizers, entrees, all predictably great. Server was outstanding. Here’s my issue. We were seated in an empty section, not surprising for a Monday evening. It was a double row of eight booths, four on each side, aisle in middle. Halfway through our meal they seated a group including a child directly across the aisle from us. It was a normal 8ish year old kid, which means talking loudly and constantly. We have no problem with kids, we have kids, but last night was a night out just for us. Our enjoyment was lessened by having to listen to someone else’s kid for the rest of our meal. When we went to leave, a manager that we passed asked how our meal was. I told her that it was good food, great service, but let her know that we would’ve enjoyed it more had they not seated a child so close, especially when there were plenty of empty tables available. The manager was barely polite, and told us that next time this happens we can let our server know that we’re “uncomfortable around children” and that we’d be moved immediately. I feel like she missed the point.  Relocating a table full of food and drinks would’ve been more disruptive than the child was. So, am I being unreasonable to expect the host/hostess to seat groups by type in order to accommodate everyone? Families by families, quiet couples by quiet couples, etc?  \n\nEdit: This is a restaurant famous for salad and breadsticks for reference.\n\nI am not bitter, and didn’t mean to inspire bitterness in others. I don’t dispute the child’s right to be there. Just would’ve hoped that they not have been seated 4 feet from me. On a busy night I would never expect such a thing. In fact, on a night when they were packed this noise would’ve been no where near as noticeable. The mostly empty restaurant actually amplified the “loud talker”. \n\nI didn’t complain in the hopes of freebies. We paid, tipped like 23%, and mentioned it on our way out while remaining polite, since honest feedback can sometimes help. Was sure to complement server and food. \n\nThey had a different server than we did. \n\nThanks to the people who remained civil, even if you do think I’m unreasonable. After all, I did ask. ",

        "text": "So I have posted about this before, except my submission was automatically removed because I guess manipulating the actual company name isn't allowed in this sub! Forgive me, I've never posted on this sub before and sometimes on other subs (like TalesFromYourServer or DumpsterDiving, idk if linking is allowed, I'm gun-shy now), making a play-on word of the actual company name is allowed.\n\n// I DID IT AGAIN. IT'S SO HARD TO EDIT NAMES OUT WHEN YOU'RE JUST TYPING A STORY. I'M SO SORRY PLEASE DON'T BAN ME I'M JUST FUCKING STUPID //\n\nI assume you guys know which company I'm talking about, the one run by the richest man in the world who gets richer every day.\n\nSo this happened about...2 weeks ago, I think? About that.\n\nI was downstairs on my way to the kitchen for a snack and had taken a detour to pet one of my cats who was laid out on our ottoman ([cat tax](https://imgur.com/a/PPIK3au)). We keep the main door open and security screen closed on fair days for air flow and the kitties like to sit in front of it and watch the world go by, in addition to watching the lizards sun themselves and the wild bunnies that come out at night.\n\nI noticed someone walking up to my door with a box in hand. Not my regular mail carrier, one of Big River's independent contractor drivers who deliver in their own cars and not their white panel van drivers.\n\nI open the screen door and greet him: \"hi, are you my Big River delivery man?\" He says yes and hands me my package. What happened next was the bizarre part.\n\nHe looks me up and down, you know the head-to-toe once-over you get by judgmental grandmas or creepy men in bars? It's very obvious. So he did that, then shakes his head (disapprovingly?) and mutters something under his breath. He then tries to run away and I call after him \"what was that?\" he half-turns back to me and says \"have a *wonderful* day\" VERY sarcastically.  I KNOW that's not what he said under his breath since what he muttered was only a few words.\n\nHe then goes back to his car across the street (parked in the fire zone, ample street parking available at the time), THROWS his tracker into his front seat and PEELS out of my housing development. The whole time I could hear him shouting to himself. From across the street.\n\nI honestly was so shocked I didn't even process what had happened until about 10 minutes later when I told my best friend/roommate. He told me that's not normal and I should call their logistics department and report it. \n\nThe whole thing unsettled me a fair amount. This guy knows my first and last name, what I look like, and where I live. I did debate whether I should report it or not because I don't know if this guy is smart enough to figure out who filed a complaint against him. I ended up calling their logistics department the next day and told the nice lady the story. I'm not sure if this guy was mentally unstable or just an asshole, but I'm still rattled by it.\n\nTo give you guys some context, I'm a 23 year old woman that's heavily tattooed and pierced. I have resting bitch face and I'm generally pretty scary-looking, and I live in an old white people retirement community town. I stick out like a sore thumb here. However, I am extremely nice and have worked in customer service for 4 years. I tip well, don't make a fuss because I know how busy service establishments can get, and I'm usually pretty understanding. I'm your typical millennial as opposed to a baby boomer that thinks the world owes them a favor, millennials are all spoiled brats, and that servers deserve to get stiffed if they refill their waters 3 seconds too late.\n\nI did wrestle with whether I should report him or not. Maybe he was just having a bad day, or a previous customer was a complete asshole to him. But I talked to my best friend/roommate about it and he's like even if he WAS having a bad day, that's not an excuse to make a customer uncomfortable and be nasty to them. It's impossible (for me at least) to make a snap judgment about somebody from just a 20-second interaction, so idk what his deal really was.\n\nAre there any Big River drivers out there? do you guys have any insight into this? I'm looking for opinions and maybe validation. I've never reported ANYBODY in the service industry before, I know having a job is life-and-death for some people, but I was so put off by this interaction and sort of insulted that I figured I should maybe say something. It wasn't an okay thing to do by any means, so I was wondering what the great world wide web's thoughts were. ",

What's your name?\n\nme: If you busted me yesterday, wouldn't you know what my name is...\n\ndk: *flashes some badge from his pocket*\n\nme: Nice fake badge.\n\ndk: It isn't fake.

I work a block away from here, I'm not going to steal from this store.\n\ndk: Okay, well I just had to see your face. You look like someone I busted in here yesterday.\n\nAt first I thought it was a poorly formulated creepy ploy to hit on me because he had this stupid little smirk on his face the whole time. Then he flashed his real-because-it-physically-exists badge and I realized this wasn't some new redpill tactic to add to the age-old list of failed pick-up lines; this dude was wasting my lunch break because he was a Big Boy with an Important Jobby serving up overpriced justice like it's asparagus water. \n\nBy the time I got back across the parking lot to work, I was pretty pissed and asked my coworker if that company employs or contracts plainclothes LP because I still wasn't completely convinced that dick knot wasn't just a weirdo. My coworker used to work there and when he heard my story he flipped out and sent me back to talk to a manager. \"Go right now!! We'll cover for you.\" \n\nThis time I'm wearing my work apron with our logo emblazoned across the front and, while waiting for the manager, I could see dick knot still \"shopping\" around the store. What's he pretending to buy anyway? \n\nThe manager was extremely apologetic and agreed that it was way out of line. He did admit they'd had a rash of thefts recently and I do apparently look like a girl they caught yesterday so he wasn't surprised about who it was when I pointed the guy out. Manager issued me a $50 gift card, said he hoped this wouldn't affect my patronage of their store, then immediately went off to 'bust' officer dick knot. \n\nI wasn't looking for money but sure I'll take 50 bucks in hush money (oops?) from the grocery chain that was investigated for overcharging their customers. \n\nAnd if you're reading this, Junior Officer Dog Lipstick, I hope you got ~~fired or~~ [retrained and] reassigned.

Never really had many issues. \n\nUntil today...\n\nSlight backstory, I work nights, so when I come home,  I usually order from this app, get my food and crash since I'm normally too tired to drive much further than home after my shift. \n\nGet home, place my usual. This app usually has a tracker that goes with it giving you the location of your delivery driver until they get to your door. \n\nPlace order at 1:18PM. \n\nI occasionally glance at the app for updates. \n\n1:50PM. \n\nGet a notification they're a little busy at my restaurant and it'll be just a little longer.\n\n2:15PM.\n\nCheck the app again, driver is still at the same location as almost an hour ago. \n\nIn the past the app has acted up and the tracker was way off. Well today something was different. \n\nContact support and request a new driver as its been over an hour now. I'm assured by the rep that the driver is diligently on his way to the restaurant.\n\nOk. Fair. It's busy. I could see it. I close the support chat. \n\nThe second its closed: update! Delivery driver has delivered your order. Please rate them. \n\nThat's odd. I've been on my front porch for over an hour now. Haven't seen anyone. \n\nContact support again. This time the rep tells me they're going to contact the driver and see what's going on and they'll get back to me in 5 minutes. \n\n3:30PM. \n\nGet notification the chats been closed by the rep. \n\nAt this point I'm beyond angry.\n\nContact them again. \n\nTurns out the driver took my order on the app, then decided to go home. When the company contacted him, he swore up and down he delivered it and was off the clock now. Company calls the restaurant and is greeted by a very angry employee trying to find out why an order has been sitting there for almost 3 hours. \n\nThe company's fix? Ask me to replace the order and they will refund me my money in credit so I can replace the order immediately. Ultimately I'm still paying full price for everything, no credit, no sorries, nothing.\n\nHere it is now almost 5PM. Order just got delivered by someone else. I think I'm done with these guys. \n\n(Edit: Update) Finally got my order. The restaurant gave them the order I had placed hours before.  IE, cold. Company won't respond to my support tickets anymore. I'm done. ",

        "text": "I recently went to Tokyo for a week, lucky to get pretty much free tickets via a voucher. Travelling solo with a five year old in a country that I hadn’t been to before, I spent the week prior planning out an itinerary (which of course, included plenty of time at Disneyland). \n\n\nThe day prior to leaving, I happened to get chatting with another customer at my salon, who highly recommended a gyoza place, as well as a bar. I reviewed the bar, which is on a Top 20 list for the planet, and decided to add it to my itinerary as the ONE place for me on the trip. I checked local customs and could see that kids were ok at bars during the day, or ikebanas etc where parents could have beers with food, but decided to wing it and see if they’d allow me to attend, kid in tow, early in the evening. \n\n\nHoogle Laps enables me to find it, and triumphant, I pushed the door open, quietly, kid in tow. The staff graciously and apologetically advised that children could not be served at the bar.  I responded that I understood, but would it be possible to stay for just one drink? They responded that just one would be ok - just one - so we were seated in the corner, and I immediately set the kiddo up on his tablet with headphones, and reminded him of the behavioural expectations we’d run through prior. \n\n\nHe complied, and the staff soon came to ask me what I wanted. A brief chat ensued (I like whisky, but also enjoy X flavours). They asked if the kiddo would like a juice. “Sure, anything will be fine.”\n\n\nWhat they returned with in a few minutes was the BEST drink I’ve ever had. The flavours were PERFECTLY balanced, and the kid’s “juice” was comprised of fresh pressed raspberries and a few other fruits. He didn’t GAF, because iPad and juice, but I spent the next half hour supremely happy to have a Saturday night out at one of the world’s best bars, in Tokyo, with an appropriately behaved kid. And the best drink I’d ever tasted. \n\n\nDid I mention that this was the **best** drink I’d ever been poured?\n\n\nThe bill came to ~30 AUD, so I left the equivalent of $50 AUD, eternally grateful. \n\n\nMy bartender chased me out to insist on returning my tip, insisting it was too much. I happily explained how grateful I was to them for not only serving me and my child against policy, but making us more than welcome AND serving me the best drink I’d ever had. \n\n\nHe supplied me with his card and told me we’d be welcome any time. \n\n\nThank you ~~Ben~~ *random excellent bar* in ~~Shin~~ *random nightlife area of Tokyo*.

        "text": "I thought I would share a positive experience I had when I went shopping around New Year's.\n\nI made a few planned stops to my favorite stores in the mall, when I went to look for some new anime T-shirts at a store I'll call \"Cool Subject\" (I hope that's as clever as it sounds XD) that sells a lot of pop culture items. I picked out two since they had a buy one get one some-odd off percent sale of some sort, if I remember correctly. Last time I'd been there they had some Rick and Morty items in the clearance area so I looked them over, finding an item I wanted on clearance with a 50&amp;#37; off sticker. Full price is about $26 which isn't bad, but still pretty pricey for someone making minimum wage. XD (Doing the math in my head, $26 is about half a day's pay for me after taxes and such) I had been eyeing it for a while cuz it's cool and I'm a total nerd, so I felt lucky to find the last one they had there.\n\nSo I proceeded to check out, when I was told my total I thought it was a little high considering I only had two T-shirts and a clearance item, but I only had about fifteen minutes to get to my last stop before my brother and I needed to head home so we wouldn't be late for dinner. But I double-checked my receipt anyways when I got to the food court, and I saw I had been charged full-price for the Rick any Morty item. I already knew everything I needed to grab at the last store on my trip, so I rushed back to Cool Subject and waited a few minutes before an associate was available to help me. I was a little panicked that they might not be able to fix it for me, but I didn't raise my voice at all cuz no one needs that grief, especially with the shopping rush there always is for the holidays. Honestly if it was a mistake and not really meant to be on clearance, I had already spent the money so I would have just kept it. But luckily the associate (if I recall correctly, she was a manager or an assistant manager) who helped me was able to fix the mistake; I returned the item for full price, then she sold it to me for the clearance price. I guess apparently their system had been having trouble with scanning the clearance items correctly, which she told me, and I understood. Stuff happens, and it wasn't anyone's fault.\n\nI kind of panic sometimes when I'm in an unexpected situation like that so I tend to not shop alone, but my brother and his friend had their own stops to make so we met up together after we made our final purchases at the last store I was stopping at. I was a little worried that I couldn't handle the situation well, sometimes I start to cry when things catch me off guard, but I tried to keep calm and I didn't raise my voice. I probably talked a little too fast like I do when I'm nervous, but the associate was calm and understanding and I'm glad she was able to help me and resolve it. I love this store and I get most of my graphic T's there, and they give you birthday coupons every year which is awesome. :D\n\nSo, thank you Cool Subject employees for always being helpful! And for getting my Rick and Morty item for half off. [Wubba Lubba Dub Dub!](https://i.imgur.com/bfQFttC.gif)\n\n(First time linking an imgur gif, hope I didn't fail. XD)",

When watching this shit show, it was all from the perspective of an empathetic young adult. \n\nSo, it's my cheat day, the gym I go to is right by a popular fried chicken chain. My boyfriend and I scramble from the parking lot into a messy dining room. Tables haven't been wiped down, there's a backlog of customers waiting by the counter, and the people out front appear to be two boys about 16 and 18. \n\nI stand at the counter, watching and waiting, the 16 year old seems to be new, I'd guess been there a month or so. The 18 year old is giving out instructions and running between front and back. Ten minutes go by and we still haven't been served, four more customers have lined up behind us, someone's already walked out. I'm standing here trying to be patient as I watch the manager dawdle out the back. He checks the friers, he walks to the fridge, he grabs nuggets, he puts nuggets down, he stares at a screen, he watches his army of adolescents, he casually tries to initiate conversation with them when they're obviously stressed out. \n\nThe teens out the front aren't able to keep up, there's so many family orders. I still haven't been served, and this asshole is walking at the pace of an elderly snail on his way to a funeral. It's dreadful to watch. \n\nThe older teen finally takes my order and I sit down with my boy. Our food is out after another ten minutes. The inexperienced kid must have prepared it because we have no napkins or cutlery sets. There's also a separate bag for both a single bottle of water, and for a potato and gravy. \n\nNow, I am not mad at either of the boys out front, I'm mad as all hell that the shift manager wouldn't help them. I've seen some good managers at other chains, the kind who say \"I've got this, please focus on preparing the meals,\" but this guy didn't care. Maybe he was new, maybe he was having an off day, but the kids were struggling so hard. \n\nAnyway, the food was disgusting as always but it filled that kinda once a month craving I get for bowel destroying grease. \n(Edit:formatting)",

        "text": "A little bit of a background to this story before I get into it. I use to work at upscale casual restaurant that serves american cuisine, sushi, and cocktails, it was also sort of a chain as the company has 46 locations with most in the US and few outside of the US. At the time I worked there I was a food runner and sometimes when it was slow or the Executive Chef was busy I would also be the expeditor. It was a nice little job where I made minimum wage ($7.25/hour) and got some tips since I got a little bit of a cut from all the server's tips. I ended up leaving that job after working there for a year but I was really good friends with a bunch of people there including the General Manager.\n\n2-3 years ago I decided to stop by, I had just gotten paid and was in the mood for some good sushi. This restaurant had a little sushi bar that sat 4-5 people and it was right in-front of the Sushi Chefs so you could watch them make sushi for other people and order sushi directly from them as well. The Sushi Chefs actually made a pretty good hourly wage, and than they got a percent of a server's tips based on how much sushi their customs ordered. But the main thing is that when you are at the sushi bar you do have an actual server who takes care of you and it is the easiest job. They take your order for anything from the kitchen, get your drinks, and than the Sushi Chefs tell them what to ring up for the sushi that you ordered directly from them. So if you are sitting there chances are most of what you are going to be eating is sushi so the server has to stop by every once in a while to check on you.\n\nWell when I sat there, the server whose section included the sushi bar did absolutely nothing. The Sushi Chef (Who I am friends with and knew him when I worked there) has to practically do everything for me. He got me my drinks/refills, kept having to bug the server to ring up the food I wanted from the kitchen, and get me everything pretty much. It pretty much pissed me off since I knew the server was going to be getting a majority of the tip that I gave but at the same time I didn't want to stiff him since that would mean the Sushi Chef wouldn't get his cut.\n\nThe General Manager saw me sitting there and came over to talk to me to see how I was doing since I haven't seen him in a while. While I was talking to him I mentioned that I did not like the server at all and he did absolutely nothing, that I wasn't comfortable giving him a tip for doing nothing but at the same time I wanted to tip the Sushi Chef only. I only had my debit card so I didn't have any cash to pay or give directly to the Sushi Chef. Unfortunately, this wasn't something that could be done but the General Manager looked at me with the most serious face on and told me to consider that server fired. I was a little speechless about this since I only really wanted him to talk to the server about this problem since I could see the server through out the entire meal doing absolutely nothing since he had no one else to take care of.\n\nI had already paid the bill with my debit card and I just had to sign for the tip and such, the bill was like $50 and I decided to go ahead and write done a big fat 0  for the tip. Afterwards I walked out of the restaurant and to the nearest ATM to get some cash, came back and gave the Sushi Chef $20 in cash and told him that was all for him.",

        "text": "So this happened almost five years ago. I still feel awful about this because I let my grief get the best of me and took it out on some poor guy making minimum wage. \n\nTW: Mention of child death\n\nSo. My oldest son had a twin at birth that didn't make it. I'm pretty sure there's details in my post history. Suffice it to say, between losing SonB and SonA being in the NICU constantly balanced on the edge of life and death.. I was not in a good place. But that does *not* excuse my behavior. \n\nSonB lived long enough to qualify for a life insurance payout. Honestly, this was a silver lining on a very dark cloud. 98% of that money was used for gas because we made the one hour (one way) drive back and forth from the hospital every other day for 5 months. Some of the money was used for cremation and cremation pendants for ourselves and family. The one thing we bought that was not specifically geared towards those babies was a game. \n\nMy husband is a gamer. It's his happy place. We really needed some damn happy during that time and the newest game from his favorite series had just come out, which was good timing as we'd just picked up the cremation pendants. We went to the local game store to buy a copy. He grabbed the game, we browsed a bit, and we went to the register. \n\nThis is where I become an asshole. I made a quiet, sarcastic comment to my husband that \"Well, I guess it's a good thing we have a little spare money, huh?\" \n\nAnd the cashier.. The poor, probably not even 20 years old cashier.. He grins at us and jokes, \"Oh, did you win the lottery?\"\n\nAccording to my husband, my face went completely blank. And I replied, \"No. Life insurance.\" Then promptly turned on my heel and walked to the other side of the store before I cried. I left my husband to explain to the cashier and saw his face go from confused to horrified. \n\nI spent a couple of minutes gathering myself, went back, and apologized. I told him I was so sorry I had said that. I told him I was out of line. His smile was gone, guys. He was so sweet, but the light was gone from his eyes. I feel like I destroyed a piece of his soul, or at least ruined his day. \n\nAlmost five years later and I still feel awful. It wasn't his fault. He didn't need to know what we were going through. He was just some guy doing his job and I went and emotionally punted him in the nuts. \n\nGame store sales associate, if you're out there, I'm so sorry. ",

        "text": "Hello friends! LTL, FTP, mobile user, long story, etc etc. So this happened a few months ago.\n\nMy friends and I had just spent all day in an amusement park that has a bit more than a couple Flags. We were trying to decide where to eat before we drove back to campus and pass out from exhaustion, and I was really craving indian food.\n\nThe city I am from, and the college I go to has a very low Asian population, and Indian restaurants were pretty hard to find. As the Designated Indian Friend™ I was in charge of finding a good restaurant and I found one that “specializes” in a specific type of Indian food, so we all pile in and zoom over. \n\nSo anyways it’s all fun and dandy we’re joking around and the waiter comes to take our order. He’s this awkward ish indian man like late 20s/early 30s type, seems pretty fresh off the boat. I order for everyone (more duties as designated indian friend) when he just pauses. (Waiter is W, Friend is F) \n\nW: which one of you wants the butter chicken?  \nF: uh I did?  \nW: is that what you always order in indian restaurants?   \nF: I guess? I don’t really go to a lot?  \nW: Are you sure that’s what you want? I think you should order something else. It’s a very basic order When there are so many different options.  \nF: ok but...that’s what I want to eat. \n\nIt was a very awkward exchange but he writes it down. And then starts talking to me. \n\nW: is your name Pam? (fake name)  \nMe: *\\confused face\\* uh...yes  \nW: yeah I heard your friends say it  \nMe: okay....  \nW: there’s a REALLY popular indian app where you can chat with robots online and the one I talk to is named Pam! Is it you?   \nMe, not really sure if he’s joking or not: haha! Crazy!  \n\nAnd a bunch of really awkward small talk later he goes to put in our order. Somewhere in between delivering our drinks and our food he comes back again. \n\nW: Pam! *\\pulls out phone and shoves it close to my face\\* this is the app I was telling you about! \n\nHe then goes into detail showing me exactly how it works and does a sample message to “Pam” and repeatedly asking if I was her?? Just a very weird exchange that wasn’t major drama inducing but did leave me a bit uncomfortable because he came back to our table very often and stress my name a lot. There was also a lot of only making eye contact with me/speaking to me type of stuff the whole time. \n\nEdit: Fixed formatting.",

        "text": "I want to preface this tale by saying that I am a server myself, and I’ve worked in the restaurant industry for about 5 years now. So whenever I go out to eat, I’m very understanding of how things can be. Also I will add that I tip what I feel is earned. If it’s busy at the restaurant, and the server takes awhile to get to us, I understand that. Regardless of things they personally can’t help, they will still get a 20% tip (or more) from me if they give good service, even if rushed. Bad service on the other hand... is exactly as I describe below. \n\nSo this past weekend, my boyfriend and I went out to eat at a popular chain restaurant that is named after a certain type of cheese. We had never been there before, and were promptly sat at our table by the host with menus, and waited for our server to come over to take our drink order. And we waited. And waited. And waited. About 15 minutes go by when he finally comes over and greets us by saying “sorry I didn’t know you guys were in my section. What you wanna drink?” Ummm... okay. I should note that this dude had walked by our table twice before this, and we had assumed he wasn’t our server based on the fact that he didn’t say anything to us or even acknowledge us before this, not even a “hey I’ll be right with you.” Nothing. So he gets our drink orders, which were two waters, and we wait another 10 minutes for him to bring them out. When he finally does come back, we give him our food orders. My bf ordered his meal, as well as a SMALL portion appetizer (this is important). And then I ordered my meal, which was country fried steak, which on the menu says that it is automatically served with mashed potatoes and green beans (this is important too.) I told him that I wanted to add an additional side of broccoli cheddar casserole to my order as well. The server just stares at me for a minute and then says “sorry I can’t hear you. What was that side you said?” So I tell him again and he just stares at me, nods his head and says “okay.” Then reads back our order to us perfectly, except he forgot my broccoli cheese casserole side, which I tell him AGAIN. And again he just stares at me and says “yeah.. okay.” And then walks off to put it in the computer. \n\nAbout 2 minutes later, he comes back to our table and says to me “I didn’t hear you when you said your additional side, you need to speak up!” And at this point I started to get angry because he had already asked me to repeat myself TWICE before, and the last time I did, he didn’t say that he couldn’t hear me, just nodded his head and walked off like he understood?!! I was also mad because even if he couldn’t hear me, telling someone you do not know “you need to speak up” comes across as very rude and disrespectful, and there are better ways to let someone know they are speaking too softly. Anyway, I repeat the broccoli cheese side for the THIRD TIME, and I’m not going to lie.. I had a bit of attitude in my voice this time (because of reasons listed above.) I think the server picked up on my tone because after I said it, he shoots back “well the country fried steak comes with two sides and you only said one and I couldn’t hear you!!” Umm WHAT?!! So I tell him that on the menu it says that it already comes with mashed potatoes and green beans. And he says back to me “no no no, those are used as examples of what to get with it, but if you want those sides, all you had to do was tell me” and then he walked off before I could say anything back. My boyfriend and I even looked back on a menu after he walked off to make sure I didn’t read it wrong. I didn’t. I was PISSED. \n\nFinally our food comes out, broccoli casserole and all. He checks on us once during our meal, not to ask if we would like refills but to say “y’all don’t need refills, right?” With our water glasses both empty at this point. Wow. \n\nLater when he comes back again, he drops off the check without a word, and my bf points out to me that he charged us for a large appetizer (even though when he read our order back to us he said small) and he’s prepared to just pay for it and leave because we did eat it, after all. But I insist on pointing it out to him, because we’ve never been to this restaurant before so how were we supposed to know that we got a large appetizer instead of a small?? Also, he read our order back to us, that HE HAD WRITTEN DOWN, and said small then. We wait about 10 minutes for him, he’s no where to be found. A manager walks by our table and I pull her aside and point it out to her, explaining that we had never been here before and didn’t know that we had received a large instead of a small. I also tell her that when our server read our order back to us, he even said small then. She apologizes profusely and even says “we’ve been having a few issues with this server tonight but I assure you we’re going to take care of this, and this will be comped from your check.” I told her that we are willing to pay for a small appetizer and they don’t have to completely comp it, but she just sighed and said it would be taken care of. Manager lady brings us our new check, we give her our money, and about 5 minutes later the server comes out with our checkbook. He put it on the table and says “You welcome” and walks off. \n\nI tipped him $1. \n\nLPT for any servers out there: DONT DO ANYTHING THIS GUY DID UNLESS YOU WANT A SHITTY TIP!! \n\n\n\n",
