They filmed him jacking off- which, yes, is embarrassing, but in terms of the whole CP plot-twist, what does that video prove?  Are the hackers recording his screen and somehow constructing a side-by-side video?  Did they secretly place another camera in the room that shows what's on his screen?  How would the hackers prove his guiltiness by just leaking a masturbation video?\n\nThese thoughts led me to think - this makes sense for why they chose Kenny to fight the man.  Kenny wouldn't have been arrested (most likely) for simply the embarrassing video of him, so by manipulating him to kill the man, the hackers have then created actual tangible evidence of guiltiness to put him in prison.  And even if Kenny had died in the fight, it would've been justice for the hackers.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

        "text": "I understand why many individuals around my age (50) could find this series odd, confusing and even scary. \n\n\"Technology is scary! See this show proves it!\"*\n\nBut really all the episodes I have seen so far are just injecting technology into age old human questions and experiences.\n\nExample:\n\nI am currently watching \"Hang the DJ\" and this is nothing more than contrasting/comparing arranged love against romantic love. And that is an very old trope. The \"computer\" simply replaces society/friends/parents advice. Their advice is important and shouldn't be ignored. However the individual must still decide for themselves. And if they do not, or cannot, decide for themselves they will always feel lost or, at best, unsatisfied.\n\nNothing in this series is really new, only adapted to include modern technology. Every episode is just a retelling of an age old story. \n\nAnd I have nothing against this! Classic stories must always be adapted to modern times. They are classic because they actually reflect the human condition. \n\nSo my question is, again, do you think this series contributes anything new to the the age old questions? Or is it just re-framing those age old questions so that \"you youngsters\" can question and answer them on your own terms?\n\n*I grew up with technology in isolated, backwards part of the world. So I  always questioned how one affected the other. So I find this series well done but nothing really special. Edit---Not that I imagined all these stories or possibilities. I am not that smart. I did seek out other far better thinkers than me in science fiction, pure science writers and classic explores of the human condition. \n\n",

        "text": "Hey guys, I'm a big fan of black mirror, atleast season 1 and 2, and some episodes of season 3. Tried to watch the new season, but the first episode was so bad, probably one of the worst and flawest episodes, as a biologist I couldn't help but cringe at that technology.   Tried to give it another chance, by watching the highest rated episode, which is Hang the DJ, and again, another garbage.  Are all the episodes that bad? Those 2 are really the best of the season? If so, do you think black mirror became another netflix garbage that most people will brainless consume just because it's on netflix, just like 90% of what they produce?\n\n Not saying you are wrong to like it, it's all a matter of taste, you are not better or worse than anyone for liking or hating something, I just really want to hear the opinion's of the loveliest and most polite place on the internet, Reddit.\n\nThanks!\n\ntl;dr Is the new black mirror american trash now? Is it worth watching season 4?",
