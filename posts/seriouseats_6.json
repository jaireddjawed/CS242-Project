And then you can spend your time enjoying it.\n\nIt's helped me to be more mindful of what I eat, stay on track, as I can literally see what I've eaten throughout the day, and treasure what I'm eating at the time.\n\nThe app is at a very early stage and I have lots of exciting features I'm looking to release such as:\n\n\\- Nutritional challenges (where you can learn, remain accountable and eat).\n\n\\- Retrospective meal logging (where you forget or don't want to log a meal in the moment).\n\n\\- Customised recipe book (so you've got quick access to meals based on your likes and dislikes, budgets, times etc...).\n\nThe app is currently on the App Store for pre-release and will be released on February 1st 2023.\n\nYou can sign up to the pre-release here: [https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/munch-quick-photo-food-diary/id1660087790](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/munch-quick-photo-food-diary/id1660087790)\n\nI'd love to hear any feedback you have on the app so far and or any problems you encounter when trying to eat a healthy balanced diet whilst at the same time enjoying food.\n\nHopefully Munch can help you to healthy and sustainable, lasting change where you get to eat guilt free.\n\nThanks for reading and happy eating!",

The Facebook page posted a link to (this)[https://sponsored.seriouseats.com/original-plus/a-dieticians-tips-healthy-choice-2022] sponsored post advertising low-carb frozen meals under the guise of 'healthy meals'. Now I have no objection to SE doing paid advertising - but I and several others commented on how inappropriate this specific sponsor and post is. Serious Eats promoting this kind of orthorexic garbage diet culture is really shameful by itself, but to make it worse the Facebook page has just deleted the post with critical comments and reposted as if nothing has happened. Really really gross.\n\nAgain I have no objection to SE having ads from appropriate sponsors, I get the need to pay for the writers etc. Most YouTubers I watch have some kind of ad from time to time and I don't mind. But straight up promoting something which touts a low-carb diet as a 'New Year health goal' is frankly disgusting, especially given the fact that food insecurity is such a huge problem in the US and is only getting worse - and those food insecure people unsurprisingly rely on a ton of carbs just to survive (and also, demonising carbs is gross and harmful even without that). I'm so depressed at what the site has become.",

        "text": "I’ll start by saying that I’m a full on Kenji fan boy. After buying the food lab several years ago, I rarely even bother looking up recipes outside of serious eats / Kenji universe because I value the science backed methodology and overall sensibility of his approach. I watch all his YouTube videos and have had a lot of success with many of his recipes and techniques over the years.\n\nThat said, I am at a loss when it comes to the [Chile Verde with Pork](https://www.seriouseats.com/chile-verde-with-pork-recipe). I’ve made this recipe a number of times and it’s always been a crowd favorite…. but recently I cannot for the life of me get the pork to become tender. I’ve chalked up a few misses to having too much pork compared to liquid or having to rush timing, but this time I followed the recipe to a T and it’s still not falling apart at the three hour mark. \n\nI understand wanting to balance collagen breakdown with the muscle fiber tightening and that all makes sense, except in practice. I was careful to crack the lid in the Dutch oven, have a secondary thermometer in my oven to ensure the right temp, checking doneness periodically with the poke test, but this pork will not become tender. \n\nI’m currently fighting the urge to leave it in for a few more hours but fear that it will become even tougher.

        "text": "Wondering if anyone else agrees with me but I find meal prepping really hard for people who have high standards for how their foods tastes. What I mean by that is - I cannot eat reheated roasted vegetables … I find them slimy and gross. I’m also not interested in eating grain bowls with random condiments on top of them. I like composed meals cooked fresh. Eg chicken Marsala or shrimp stir fry but made fresh every night. \n\nNow that I have a kid - I’m struggling to make this work though. Does anyone have any tips for making meal prep work? Here are the only things I have found that work for me so far:\n\n1) leaning heavily on stews or braises which get better the next day or two (beef bourguignon, pork shoulder ragu) and prepping cauliflower mash to eat them over kind of a La polenta. Chicken Marsala is actually okay this way too.\n\n2) doing various flavor packed meatballs (bahn mi, Indian kathi kebab seasoning etc) and eating them with the relevant ethnic condiments, rice, pickled veg and lettuce wraps kind of like a variation on kalbi.\n\n3) cutting broccoli or brussels sprouts ahead of time in big batches so they can be roasted fresh quickly.\n\nAny other ideas? We try to keep it lower carb but aren’t averse to a bit of rice (especially since if we freeze it and reheat, the carb content is lower, yay science!).",

The butcher told me they had folks desperate for rib roasts before Christmas... and then got a huge order of rib roasts 12/26, so they boned some of them to cut as steaks. So, so grateful for the Serious Eats references for sous vide steaks. I gave these 2 hours at 131 degrees (to give myself a little wiggle room as I am not that great at searing) then opted for the (gas) grill to sear, using the flat sides of GrillGrates. So good!

It has been on my holiday wish list for many years, but no one had gotten it for me.  \n\nThis year I finally got myself a really nice wok, and, wouldn’t you know it, I received TWO copies of The Food Lab! 😂\n\nI plan to return one of them and pick up a copy of The Wok, and then I will have both of Kenji’s books.\n\nHere is my question for those who have read both books:\n\nSince I just purchased a wok, does it matter which order I read the books in? \n\nShould I work through The Food Lab 1st?\n\nDoes The Wok build off of The Food Lab?\n\nShould I read the Wok 1st, so I can play with my new toy??\n\nI would love your insight and opinions! \n\nHappy Cooking!!!",
