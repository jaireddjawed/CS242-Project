I'm engaged in negotiations with my department to reduce the $1000+ in fees we pay out of pocket *each semester* (anyone on here knows what a significant portion of our income that is). To help my case, I was hoping to compile a list of institutions that don't charge these fees or charge much less. If anyone here would be willing to comment on their institution and fee amount AND if you're feeling generous, include a bonus link with a bursar's webpage confirming the fee amount that would be incredibly helpful.  \nCheers, all, keep fighting the good fight!",

        "text": "I’m sorry if this post is too long or isn’t exactly the kind that’s suited to this sub, but I feel lost and have no other place to go to.\n\n\n\nAt the moment I’m trying to do an MA in Economics. I just found out that I narrowly missed getting into my first choice university, here in my country, India. This was my second attempt at the entrance test. My first in 2021 went in vain because I’d recently switched streams from a more general degree of Bachelors of Commerce to studying Economics and couldn’t prepare very well. \n\nThis year, I prepared better, and secured admission in some other colleges although I don’t want to go to them since they’re not as good as my first choice college. I didn’t  want to apply for universities abroad because I didn’t do very well academically during my undergrad, and I’d only end up in some middle tier university abroad, spending huge amounts of my parent’s money to study there. The benefit wouldn’t be worth the cost. \n\nMy plan was to do my MA and work hard and improve my grades profiles before applying for a PhD in a good program abroad. But now I feel lost because I’ve wasted an entire year at home doing nothing but prepare for my entrance which didn’t end up capitalising. I have nothing to show for the year I spent. \n\nIt’ll be a year before I can give my third attempt, if I get selected, I’d have a two year gap in my resume. How badly will this affect my plans for a PhD?",

        "text": "Hello everyone! I have been thinking for about 1year (and while mentally healthy for 3 months) or so about mastering out and I have finally made the decision. I realized I do not enjoy the research that I am doing, but also, that I do not like research, I do not see myself doing it in the future, and I feel that I am losing my 20s. While I am doing research or taking the courses required for the degree I find myself wanting to learn about other things, daydreaming about other things I could be learning and that I would really enjoy working at. \n\nI do not know how to approach my PI and tell him that I want to master out in a period of a maximum of a year and a half or less (I am at the beginning of my 2nd year). I feel kind of guilty because I am repeating two courses, and my PI has paid for conferences (even though I did not have any data to present) and also is taking me to another conference (without anything to present again). I also feel guilty because there are a couple of professors/PIs that have put the effort into making me succeed and get over the bumps of graduate school, but this is not for me, I do not see myself doing this for the next 4-5 years. My life is miserable because I am doing something and putting time which I will not get back onto something I do not enjoy, I feel like I am just checking boxes for the degree and I do not enjoy this. I miss my family. I feel trapped with this grad student salary, but I am also afraid that if I master out, I will not find a job right away and then will not know what to do with my life. \n\nTL;DR I want to master out, I feel guilty after all my PI and other professors have done for me (and grant/fellowships money), but I feel miserable and do not enjoy/like research.",

I’m a dual professional degree + PhD student in year 3 of my PhD (program year 6) and will finish my PhD December 2023 to return to my professional degree. My PI is a fairly young and very successful professor with a large (30+ person) lab primarily focused on genome editing / cancer therapeutics. His focus is how to make more money / how can I commercialize this product. \n\nI had an even longer post written out, detailing many of my frustrations but basically, my PI continuously treats male coworkers very differently (better) than he treats me — grad students, technicians, and post-docs, doesn’t matter their ‘status’. \n\nToday I hit a breaking point. A relatively junior technician sent a nasty email with my PI CCed, more or less telling me what to do/giving me instructions as if he were my supervisor. After emailing my frustration to my PI and asking if we could discuss at our weekly meeting, he says, “I don’t really think he was out of line.” \n\nI knew as soon as I emailed him that he would side with this male coworker. It doesn’t matter that I’m one of the hardest working members of his lab or that I am a good student/scientist or that I was awarded an NIH fellowship. It is at the point that I hate going to lab (I still go in but go ungodly early to avoid everyone). He makes me feel like absolute garbage and I just have nothing left. \n\nI made a meeting with my committee chair for tomorrow to get his advice. He has had to confront my PI during committee meetings in the past about giving me an unreasonable number of ‘side’ projects - these are full projects that could encompass an entire thesis project. I just don’t know how to get through this last year with things on this trajectory. I’m just so tired.",

        "text": "Hi, I rarely post on Reddit but I felt like I need to vent somewhere so here it goes.\n\nI'm currently in my second year of thesis-based MA in a humanity/social studies discipline at one of the top 3 universities in Canada. I'm in the process of applying to PhD positions. I have an amazing thesis supervisor, who's a well-established scholar in the field, and he's been helping me draft my statement of intent. We had a meeting last week and my supervisor gave me a lot of concrete feedback on my statement, and I revised it accordingly. \nBecause some schools ask applicants to reach out to potential supervisors, I have been in contact with a professor in another university and sent her my statement as requested. I originally thought that despite it still needing work/tweaking, the basic ideas that I sketch out in my statement are sound. My confidence comes partly from my own ability as a future scholar, also partly from my faith in my thesis supervisor, as we have gone through the argument I make in my statement step by step. However, the potential supervisor replied to me, saying that the fundamental premise of the argument I make in my statement is flawed and that this flawed argument \"would not provide a sufficient foundation for doctoral studies.\" When I got the email I was dumbfounded by how quickly the potential supervisor shuts down even the possibility of the premise being open for debate. She simply says that \"it shouldn't be....\", whilst my thesis supervisor has published multiple papers in respectable journals exploring the possibility of the very premise.\nI've generally enjoyed my graduate studies and have had other tenured professors at my department saying to me \"you should do a PhD/you are perfectly capable of doing a PhD.\" However, this small incident was frustrating in this application process, to say the very least. I think I'm just going to forward the email I got from the potential supervisor to my thesis supervisor and ask for his take. \n\nAlright, rant over. Feel free to comment however you like :)",

The fear of missing out on the student life abroad really got to me. Does anybody have some experiences with masters degree within this subject, ans maybe some tips on what to do? I would like to study in a different country (currently in Norway). Dont get me wrong, I love my job. Its just that i dont feel that i really got to experience the student life during my bachelors, and I would love some new experiences!",

I had on campus classes before I moved out of the country, but for the past several years I’ve only done online courses. I’m wondering if anyone has any quality online Master’s programs, specifically for Marriage and Family Therapy, they know of. It would be best if these were accredited and actually considered legitimate degrees. I can do in person internships, but on campus classes are difficult since we move frequently and unexpectedly. Bonus if the school has military discounts. Thank you!",

Hustled as a musician and handyman while working part time at a restaurant until my dad had a stroke at the end of 2020. \n\nPivoted to freelancing after that. I currently balance a combination of:\n\n- Agency work as a content writer\n\n- Freelance work as a copywriter, content writer, and digital marketing specialist\n\n- 1 day per week stocking shelves\n\n- A collection of side hustles including an email newsletter + video podcast in the philosophy niche and two e-commerce stores\n\nI’ve been considering going to grad school to open up more opportunities for income. \n\nI’m considering something in humanities, possibly philosophy, which I know basically makes me a meme, but I think I have an edge over the classic “philosophy major who’s checked out from real life,” for a few reasons:\n\n-  I have several years of work experience in a wide variety of industries\n\n- I have experience running several small businesses\n\n- I’m already monetizing my passion for philosophy with my newsletter + video podcast through a combination of merchandise, Patreon supporters, and soon, ad placements and direct revenue from platforms (YouTube monetization, Medium Partner Program)\n\nI’m interested in doing a grad in philosophy specifically because I want to immerse myself in an environment full of people who share my passion and are actively engaged in the act of learning. \n\nMost of the advice I’ve found isn’t tailored for someone like me, who left academia because I wanted to participate in the “real world.”\n\nSo here are my key questions:\n\n- How much does grad school cost?\n\n- I’ve read that I may NOT need to take a test. If so, then how do I qualify and apply for grad school?\n\n- Since I’ve been out of school for 6 years, and I haven’t worked a full time job in 4 years, how could I go about getting letters of recommendation?\n\n- I would most likely focus on work and do school on the side. Is that even allowed?\n\n- Based on my history, would any programs even be interested, or will I be wasting time and money by applying?",

Still, after the summer, I work in the lab on a part-time basis to finish off my manuscript. I don’t have to interact with him on a regular basis, so I don’t really feel like he got to know me that well - but I feel like him agreeing for me to stay on at the lab was a good sign.\n\nNow applying for my PhD in Epidemiology, I’ve been told by many people who have sat on the admissions board that not getting a recommendation from your practicum supervisor looks suspicious and is a red flag. So, I felt like I had no choice but to ask my supervisor for a letter of recommendation.\n\nHe agreed but asked me to draft it for him and that he would “change/edit” it as he saw fit. I’ve tried to write a good letter for myself, but I’ve just been very paranoid that he is going to change it and sabotage my admissions. I’ve been told that letters of recommendations are weighted very highly in the program I’m applying to.\n\nWould a professor ever change a reference letter to make it more negative?

I am considering taking a leave of absence next year to do research elsewhere, though, which makes me consider withdrawing my application to apply next year instead.\n\n1. If I apply for the GRFP while on a leave of absence, could I apply a second time once I came back (for my second year) because I wouldn't technically have been enrolled the first time I applied?\n2. Would applying for the GRFP while on a leave of absence decrease my chances?\n3. Would I be able to do a semester-long internship (in computer science) while on a GRFP? Summer internships are generally okay, right?\n4. Is there any way I could take time off to do something unrelated to work like hike the Appalachian Trail if I got the GRFP, or would this have to wait until after grad school? I saw that leaves of absence are not permitted while on the fellowship.\n5. Could I defer the GRFP if I am already enrolled? For example, if I continued with my application this year, received the fellowship, and wanted to take a leave of absence next year to pursue the other research opportunity, could I defer the GRFP to begin in 2024?\n\nThank you!",

Obviously I can’t be both of these at the same time, yet the same statement has solicited both responses. \n\nI was curious for those who got accepted into a program - what worked? \n\nAlso, is there anyone here that sits on a reviewing committee? I’d love to get some first hand advice on what works for those looking at the statement. \n\nThank you in advance!",

        "text": "I am currently trying to finish up the list of schools I am applying to this fall for next year's phd cycle. I am currently doing chemical and biomolecular engineering as an undergrad but most of my research has been focused on computational pathology/modeling (what I hope to study in grad school). I am having trouble deciding if I would be better off applying to phd programs as a bioengineering major or chemical engineering major because while I am pretty sure what I want to do at the end of the day is bioengineering, I really have not taken many bio classes in college (tbh my chemical engineering classes were really hard and in order to do well in them I sort of had to sacrifice taking challenging bio classes on the side as a result if I wanted to do well in my major's classes I was required to take). I worry this would reflect negatively on me for some of the more selective schools in cities I would like to live in (like UCSD) and wonder if at the end of the day I should apply to chemical engineering programs instead since my academic background has more proof of doing chemical engineering and at the end of the day I want to get into somewhere... I also do like chemical engineering too and think I would be fine majoring in it in grad school, I just want to make sure I can do research in the bio areas and I am not sure how much the prestige of one program over another at a given school matters in terms of applying for jobs in bio if that makes sense. Any advice would be appreciated !",

I'm eyeing some of these online tutoring companies, warily and on scam-alert ofc, for some income to get me to the end before I can get a \"big girl\" job. Does anyone out there have genuine experience, good or bad, with any of these companies? The ability to work remote and on my own hours is so appealing, but if the companies are scummy then I'll keep applying to my list of \"regular\" jobs. Thanks in advance!  \n\n\nP.S. If anyone has other suggestions, I'd love to hear! Doesn't have to be Chemistry or science, just gotta pay the rent!",
