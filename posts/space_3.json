Plan to add to arch Linux air and create a deb package soon.\n\nLots of todos including writing title below thumbnail images, center then better (forgot to change that before packaging. :/) And some under the hood things.\n\nAny suggestions/feedback would be received with appreciation. I'm not a designer and the GUI came as an afterthought to make it available to more people who may be interested.\n\nCurrently let's you fetch the daily apod, after that it generates random links and downloads random apods. You can set as wallpaper, you can set past apods that are in thumbnail gallery as wallpaper. You can right click and open any apods webpage from the gallery or main page.\n\nA lot of config options, aspect ratio to crop images, run on a time interval, minimum size image to be turned into a wallpaper. Also custom env var and custom wallpaper setting command for window manager users, or if your Linux operating system isn't identified by xdg_current_desktop.\n\nThings will improve and may change drastically.\n\nThe app is mit licensed, everything is opensource and all the code is available on the GitHub. This is my first app I ever packaged and published, learning a lot and have a long way to go.\n\nThank you for taking the time to check out my app, I hope I made something someone can find some enjoyment out of. And keep a fresh astronomy wallpaper. \n\nAll the code and a compiled exe installer is available on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/jameseh/fetchAPOD/\n\n\n*Attempted to post to NASA and apod but were removed because my karma. Hope this is following the rules. I did not see anything against this when reading them.",

Because of how we define them as a \"fold or hole\" in space/time it insinuates that there is a layer of space that all black holes coexist in and possibly are connected by. \n\nSomewhat taking this from Neil Detrasse Tyson (I'm sure he didn't invent the theory) theory of \"flat world\" where they only could move/perceive left/right forward/back and never know of up/down. In that they did not understand up or down, should a 3rd dimensional being (as they only occupy 2 dimensions) pick one of them up it would appear as though their mass ceased to exist. But on return, everything would be normal aside from their new found (but not understood) knowledge of extra dimensions of reality. \n\nBlack holes are our version of flat planet, where we've \"witnessed\" an extra dimension but have zero fucking clue what it means or how it operates. Light is very capable of escaping the event horizon we simply lack the tools to observe it once it enters the unknown dimension, just like flat guy's perceived disappearance.",

It's a reminder that we are all just a small part of something much greater than ourselves. At the same time, we are also reminded of our interconnectedness with the universe and the incredible impact that we can have on the world around us.\n\nThinking about space also inspires me to reflect on the mysteries of the universe and the potential for new discoveries and breakthroughs that could change our understanding of the world. It's a reminder that there is always more to learn and explore, and that the possibilities for discovery and growth are endless.\n\nOverall, thinking about space is a humbling and awe-inspiring experience that reminds me of our place in the universe and the endless potential for exploration and discovery.",
