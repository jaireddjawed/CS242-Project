        "text": "So I opened the door when I heard a knock, and there was a Jehovah's Witness. He handed me his flyer and invited me to their meeting or whatever they do. I politely declined saying I am an atheist. He asked what lead me to that decision.\n\nAt that point I told him that if he really wanted to know, come in, sit down, have tea, and we can talk. Him and his cohort accepted, and we had an nice hour long conversation about why I didn't believe, and where I felt every religion was dead wrong on certain issues.\n\nIt was a fun hour! They wanted to know why I knew so much about the Bible if I was an atheist. I asked them if they've ever seen the movie *Twilight*. Neither of them had, because they heard it was really bad. To which I asked them how could they know if it truly was bad if they haven't seen it. There are a lot of people who LOVE Twilight. So how can they decide who is right and who is wrong.\n\nI forced myself to watch Twilight just so that I could actually say how bad it was. I wasn't expressing a common opinion. I was speaking from personal experience.\n\nAnd that is why I read the Bible and knew so much about it. Not because I listened to what other people said was wrong with it. Because I took the time to understand it, and made my own decision about it.\n\nThey were positively shocked and grateful for me taking time to talk to them. I even challenged them on a few of their own beliefs. I think they may read their Bible a bit more over the next couple of days. Specifically, I told them to really study Matthew 15.",

        "text": "To start off, you might be thinking that people who no longer believe in a God and an afterlife and complain about it are the people to be regarded as weak, immature, etc. when it is actually the exact opposite.  The reason many people are whiny is that they are too much of a human being (someone great) to possibly accept that there is no God and afterlife and no longer complain about it or to no longer believe that there is a God and afterlife. They add their own personification as a human being and as someone great to reality itself and this is why they either whine that there is no God or afterlife or still believe that there is a God and an afterlife. In short, people who whine that there is no God or afterlife or who actually believe there is a God and an afterlife are the better people who have a sense of higher purpose/self to possibly stoop so low as to either, again, accept that there is no God and afterlife and not complain, or to no longer believe that there is a God and an afterlife.  This sense of higher life and higher self that these people have (that they are special and that this life is special and intended for them or that, at least, they complain that it isn't and that it should be that way anyway), this is what makes these people special and \"higher\" (great).\n\nAlthough atheists can still achieve a sense of greatness and being someone special, the fact of the matter is that they are restricted from true greatness as I've just explained since they have stooped so low into a world where, in reality, they are not that great or special as to deserve a God and an afterlife and that this life is not something special in the sense that it was not intended for them and such.  It doesn't matter how great and special you think you are if you are an atheist, to realize that, in reality, you are not great and special in this universe is demeaning of yourself because just by giving yourself the message that you are not that great and special, this is demeaning of you as a human being and that is what makes you a lesser person.  Therefore, this is why people who have a sense of higher self and such who either complain that there is no God and afterlife or who still arrogantly believe there is a God and afterlife anyway despite much scientific evidence are the better people.",

        "text": "This is the 21st century. That is, approximately two thousand years have passed since we reset our year numbering according to the birthdate of a man who was at the center of a cultural revolution 500 years prior. Two thousand years ago, you could say that the collective worldview was a bit different than it is today. There have been several major updates that you would really want to know about if you were wondering about the world. 1: Communicable disease is caused by tiny infectious microorganisms that can be controlled. 2: Every living being and all of its traits is coded for by DNA. When your DNA gets screwed up, you get sick. Or, you prosper because you became better than everyone else. Our species looks and acts differently than worms, mice, and apes based on a relatively small set of traceable DNA changes that specialized us to occupy a certain niche. 3: The world we see isn't the only thing going on. There's a whole universe so big it blows your mind and lots and lots of empty space. \n\nOK, so, how did we come to know these things? Every single one of these facts was won, slowly, through hard work and careful thought. No one gave us a nudge on the shoulder and whispered any clues. It took centuries of collective inquiry to reach these conclusions, which are now utterly irrefutable. We can see other masses of rock beyond our atmosphere, and land on them; we can see bacteria and watch them kill people they inhabit; we can purposefully engineer mutations that have expected consequences in any species we wish to place them in. \n\nDang. Seems like we've figured quite a few matters out. Well, yes we have. And as a result of it we live lives of a much different nature than the people two thousand years ago did. You could say that the scientific revolution has graced us with or forced us into (depending on your attitude) to a greater awareness of what is around us. \n Now here is where I get confused. I grew up around a good number of \nintelligent people. In fact, they are leaders in their communities, successful at business and in family. They understand that vaccination with specific antibodies will protect their kids from specific viruses. They understand that antibiotics will kill unwanted bacteria and save their child's life. They are aware that we all make choices about each and every one of our actions, be it whether to wear pink underwear that day or to conduct the research that leads to the cure for cancer, and that these actions all have a real outcome in the world. But, they fervently believe at the same time that they need to pray for specific things to happen. \n\n In wondering about this tendency, I try to understand what things they pray about. A lot of the time it's something like safe travel; a good surgery outcome; healing to the sick; ending a global disease outbreak. To be sure these are all scary things. They are things that carry inherent uncertainty and danger. I also wonder about my relatives, as they are carefully praying for specific things for themselves and each other, does it ever occur to them to evaluate the effectiveness of their prayers to date? To say, boy, am I just talking to the sky here, or is my prayer being heard? One really good way to address this question would be to take a look at your prayer track record. Umm, wait--we can't, can we? Life is a one shot deal; there are no re-dos, no going back in time to change something, so therefore we will never know if it had turned out differently had we NOT prayed. So there is a way we get around this: we look at a whole bunch of mini-experiments at once, and look for overall differences according to our hypothesis. If God answers prayers, then a big set of people who pray would definitely experience better overall outcomes in their lives and the lives of those around them, given all their prayers for safety, health and recovery. The trouble is this isn't the case. Bad things happen to people who pray, and bad things happen to people who don't pray, and they happen at about the same rate. Nobody has published a study indicating that Christians lead inexplicably \"blessed\" lives. The rates of disease and accidental death are pretty predictable based on factors we can see and measure: if you inject yourself with a virus you will get it, and if you spend long enough in a crime-infested area, you are quite likely to be mugged. Sorry, but your prayers aren't actually helping. Somebody besides me has done the legwork to show this (Benson et al., 2006, Am Heart J). \n\nHey, you're being too literal. Christians just pray to be closer to God, to pour their hearts out, to lay their worries down. You can't \"measure\" the \"effectiveness\" of these things and prove that they don't help. They are beneficial to communities and to individuals, on a spiritual level. They provide comfort. OK then. They provide \ncomfort, even if we can't see any evidence for their influencing the world. How then \ndo we know God's up there listening? No, really, how? I think there are two \npossibilities. One, he talked directly to you and told you. Two, you heard it from \nsomeone else, who heard it from someone else, who apparently saw it when it came into being 2,000 years back. I think Two is the category most people would say they fall into. \n \nLet's be clear: my relatives have never seen nor heard God, but they have complete faith in him, and believe he can (and, maybe sometimes does, if you go on facebook and get enough people to pray with you) alter events on earth. This is based on the movement known as Christianity which had its birth 20 centuries ago. We take our predecessors' word for it: Christ exists, and so does God. Is there just one more possibility, though? Is it possible that the Christians who decided they had seen Jesus and that he was the incarnation of God were just one more society who conceived of its own beliefs, gradually cementing them into text? They wouldn't be the first ones.  People have believed in many gods (Greeks, Romans, hindus), one god (Christian, Jews, Muslims), or something in between (Buddhist, daoist). My relatives, today, they definitely don't believe in all of those belief systems. Only theirs. They see their particular beliefs as more true than the rest of the world religions. Because? Because  their family told them so. Just as the families of people believing all manner of things told them so. So which is it? Are all these versions of god(s) cool to coexist? Are they all true? Or do you literally believe that the Abrahamic God chose you as a special one in this world who gets to grow up in a place where you hear of him and be saved? (Blast all the others to tarnation.) They do not see the possibility that their faith is one entry in a larger category of specific belief systems, devised by people, that provide comfort and moral structure. We still want to pray, today, even though we know the causes of disease. The sobering reality is that now, now that we can see the causes of scary events for what they are, we are forced to realize that the forces at work are utterly indifferent to our wishes. The causes for the things we experience are not God. And  he has never answered your prayers. If you think that they are and that he has, at least admit that you have no evidence for it.\n",

        "text": "Hello /r/TrueAtheism,\n\nI wanted to make a case for Gnostic Atheism but I think I should continue the conversation I've been having, on here with all of you first. Surprisingly a youtube comment gave me some insight about a few definitions I hadn't found as clearly stated before.\n\n&gt;-Agnosticism/Gnosticism: is a position on the nature of knowledge\n\n\n&gt;-Agnostic/Gnostic is an adjective that explains whether the following position is derived from your knowledge of the topic or lack there of.\n\nUnfortunately just about no one uses, or understands Gnostic in this context as an adjective. Everyone I've asked, all of whom identify as Agnostic Atheist, say that a Gnostic Atheist would be, roughly: 'a person who does not believe in a God and knows this to be true with absolute certainty'. Thus other atheists instantly criticize the mere concept of a Gnostic Atheist as a stubborn, unchanging and unreasonable position.\n\nI think adding \"absolute certainty\" is unnecessary and muddies what could be a clear and useful label. I acknowledge that there are epistemologies that say knowledge can only be something that you can determine the truth value of with 100% confidence. Nothing else qualifies. I think that many of us would say that we subscribe to a scientific knowledge epistemology and as such, that means 100% certainty is not needed to say you 'know' something, but rather we have levels of confidences at which we can say we 'know' something. \n\nUsing a scientific knowledge epistemology, and Agnostic/Gnostic as an adjective, this is what I understand:\n\n&gt;A Gnostic Atheist does not believe in a God, believes that there are no Gods and claims to have knowledge that this belief is true.\n\nTo those who identify as Gnostic Atheist, what does that mean? What do you think of my understanding/use of the phrase?\n\n**For everyone, do you think this position can be reasonable? Do you think it's possible to support this position?**",

        "text": "I posted this over on /r/atheism and thought you guys might like to discuss it too.\n\nWe all know that language is a powerful tool for changing the way people think. And the most powerful position in any debate is the setting of terms. If there is any primal \"sin\" in rational thought, it is omitting necessary context or facts. Regardless of motivation, there is no greater thinking error than deliberately or accidentally dropping context. All knowledge is hierarchal and must be internally consistent to make sense.\n\nAtheists and rational thinkers should all be using this rarely-used word-- omissive --as a term to pejoratively describe any idea, suggestion, comment, or argument which explicitly or implicitly omits necessary context, facts or ideas. Arguing the need to rely on evidence is a difficult argument to logically make, especially against people who don't already know and understand it. But most people when faced with a pejorative accusation reflexively resort to denial as a defense, without even realizing that by doing so they might have implicitly accepted the accuser's main premises. If the goal is to argue a position fails to account for the evidence, the need to account for the evidence must not be a subject of debate. Hence the use of this term. \n\nThe subtlety of using a term which accepts the need to consider all available evidence as its main premise, but which is used not as a shortcut to arguing the need to consider the evidence but as a means to discredit an opponent's position for failing to do so, will sail right over the heads of most people. Instead of arguing over the need for evidence in making rational decisions, by becoming defensive they will be left in the position of having implicitly accepted that point and attempting to argue instead they have taken account of the evidence.\n\nCan we come up with a list of examples of how this term and other kinds of linguistic jiu-jitsu can be used to replace current attempts to argue that people should account for the rational evidence?",

Her dad is a non-denominational pastor at her church and she grew up in that environment. Her mom is also very loyal and devoted to the church. I met her in my scholarship program and she was the first person I'd interacted with ever that identified themselves religiously as being a non-denominational Christian. \n\nRecently I began writing my faith story for a project a friend is working on. I was telling Sarah about it and I detailed to her my faith experience. I then finished with saying that right now I'm not very religious but very respectful. I am personally fascinated with the role religion plays in society and people's lives. I mentioned to her how she had an impact of how I viewed people of faith that they too can be great people without trying to impart beliefs on others. \n\nI brought up how I felt that I could not deny that God exists for people, whether I personally believe in it or not. Her big thing was that I was rather respectful towards others beliefs and she related. She talked about how her dad whenever he is out likes to talk about Jesus and bring up religion with people, even strangers. She mentioned how she doesn't do this herself because as she says \"Jesus showed his faith through his actions, not yelling and jamming it down people's throats\". \n\nWe discussed whether we could see ourselves dating people that were religious or not, her expressing that faith is important to her and mutually sharing that would be something she'd look for in a future relationship. \n\nMost importantly I am glad to have the conversation. It went better then expected and was glad she handled it the way she did. No matter the differences in beliefs, I feel our friendship will last which is important to me no matter what faith. ",

        "text": "Let me be clear that I myself am an atheist, and I couldn't care less about anyone else's beliefs provided they behave as sensible humans to me. I am sure many of you can relate to this. Someone or myself, tries to argue the point that the obnoxious type of atheists need to calm down an be respectful of the other human being they are conversing with, and we are refuted by *'Oh come on! How can you compare a verbally offensive atheist to a murdering religious fanatic?'*. I have a problem with this argument.\n\nAs an atheist, we are supposed to not just be above a belief in God, but above the entire phenomenon of being away from reasonable behaviour because of our religious position. I consider atheism as a religious position. I expect more from an atheist, simply because he is at a better intellectual position than a religious fanatic. This becomes especially true, and often hypocritical, when the atheist in question behaves like a brat. What positive difference does it make to the world when at the end of the day, you remain a negative contributor because of your self-righteous rudeness?\n\nI expect a religious person to be kind, compassionate and modest, because almost every religion expects that as their core goal. Often, religious interpretations are twisted to the point that anyone with a mix of sincerity and fear who drinks this toxic concoction will become a social weed even though without religion, he could have been a decent human being. An atheist is free from such modifiers. He is free to think, to be rational, to behave like a human should behave with another human being, behave like he would expect to be treated himself. As such, an atheist behaving rudely or obnoxiously like wearing the *'Jesus loves blah blah asshole'* T-shirt in a Creationist Museum is committing a really bad crime considering the reasonability he is capable of showing. I wouldn't spare him thinking *atleast he is not killing someone*, I would try to make him show that he is really being a pathetic individual (thankfully, most comments on that post did tell him that he was being an asshole).\n\nI believe that mentality evolves on an individual level. I don't think a world without murderers and fanatics will be a 'beautiful place', not when there are rude self-righteous brats who can't seem to get over the novelty that they don't believe in some god. The world doesn't *just* need less murderers, it needs more reasonable people, more compassionate and kind, two human emotions which make a huge difference on a social plane, religion or no religion. I don't believe in waiting for everyone to stop being a religious murderer before we start to focus on being better humans. I think an atheist has more responsibility in being a *better human being* than a religious person, because he is more free, more logically sound, and less fearful, or at least he should be.\n\nI know, atheism is not like religion, it doesn't have anything else in common other than the fact that 'we don't believe in a god'. But if we can come together enough to create IRL groups as well as online forums and form circlejerks as well as have meaningful discussions like on this sub, I think we have enough in common to expect some levels of moral decency and rational behaviour, the levels being much above those one would expect from a religious person. \n\nTl;dr: I expect more from an atheist than a religious person, a hell lot more.\n",

Something else?) and then at some point after that one of those strands somehow found itself in the first cell, which then divided, becoming [the last universal ancestor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_universal_ancestor), starting the whole tree of life as we know it.  As far as we can tell, this was the only occurrence of this kind of chemical synthesis.  As Darwin said, \"Probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed.\"\n\nMy questions: \n\nIsn't it strange that there are no areas in the contemporary world- whether geothermal pools, deep sea vents, etc- where those same amino acids synthesize, creating swarms of those same primitive life-forming molecules that then form new bases of new trees of life? And why hasn't this happened over and over since that first cell that led to all life as we know it? It seems odd to me that according to our evidence, the chemical path that led to the first spark of life only happened once in the billions of years of earth's history.\n\nAnd the fossil record and the theory of the last universal ancestor- isn't it strange that only one cell formed out of presumably many moles of amino acids combining with each other that led to that first self-replicating strand?  That first strand was the single most important molecule in the history of our solar system, and yet it was a molecule created only once.  How do we account for this strange fact?\n\nI hope what I'm asking is clear, for me this is a mysterious part of the fossil record where the science seems particularly incomplete.  The exact steps in the abiogenesis process, whether occurring on Earth or elsewhere, still remain unknown.",

Therefore, everyone who is religious is an ex-atheist.\n\nThe only way this argument doesn't work is if you deny that babies are atheists in any meaningful sense. But if you deny babies are atheists in a meaningful sense, then atheism must have meaning greater than merely lacking belief since babies merely lack belief. Hence, weak atheism, or merely lacking belief, is incoherent.\n\nIf weak atheism were coherent, you would have no basis for your objection. You believe you have basis for your objection, hence, you cannot rationally believe that weak atheism is coherent.\n\nHowever if you still accept atheism as simply a lack of belief would it be correct in saying:\n\n* Everyday thousands of people are becoming theist ,who were formally atheist when they were younger.\n\n* Most new atheist (not to be confused with new atheism ) are babies because they lack belief.\n\n* Most newly existing atheist are ignorant of the world around them because they are babies.\n\n* It is not incorrect for a theist to call himself an ex-atheist if he was referring to the time when he was a baby therefore it was correct to say the majority of people on this earth being theist are ex atheist.",

Later, my questions got more sophisticated and I would ask about evidence for Christ and would explain the difficulty I had with believing Jesus died for my sins without evidence. I was told by my camp counselor to \"just have faith.\" Unfortunately, my dislike of faith-based belief took me on a long journey where I first ended up a Fundamentalist Christian rather than an atheist. Since I was indoctrinated with belief in a Christian God from childhood, and the world made sense to me through that filter, I took it to the extreme and was a balls to the wall creationist thinking I had the evidence to support it; you know, evidence like Piltdown man hoax, Paluxy river tracks, no transitional fossils, good stuff like that *snark*.\n\nFortunately, when you base your religious beliefs on the supposed evidence and not on faith, once you get shown how bad the evidence is, losing the religion comes a little easier. I was fortunate to have a group of atheists in an online forum patiently explain to me the evidence for evolution and show me how absurd creationism was, and it lead to my deconversion in 2005.\n\nI have introspected a great deal about what lead to my deconversion and subsequent atheism. I don't believe it was solely being shown evidence for evolution, although that was the last straw. There was also the fact that my best friend who I loved dearly was an atheist and a wonderful person and I had severe cognitive dissonance about her going to hell. My degree in philosophy also took me through thoughts of comparative religion and recognizing how religions are essentially geography based, so what made one regions religion more true than another?\n\nSince becoming atheist, I have been interested in other  deconversion stories and what lead to a change in how the deconverted viewed the world.\n\nIf you have a moment, I would be interested in hearing about the formative moments in your deconversion and how you broke through the indoctrination of religious belief. What was  it that altered the pattern of thinking that once caused you to see the world as a creation of a god?\n\nIf you have seen any research done in this before, I'm interested in that as well. With a background in experimental psychology, I have always toyed with the idea of studying common themes in religious deconversion and one day writing a book about it. \n\nTL;DR What were the formative thoughts/moments in your religious deconversion?\n",

Maybe less so on the third one, since in the last century of the scientific renaissance, religious institutions have generally (with some exceptions) interfered with, and often wickedly stifled scientific inquiry into of the nature of 'humanness' and consciousness.\n\nIf we accept Occam's and Hitchen's razors, which (respectively) are summarized as:\n\n* Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.\n* What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.\n\nthen we must reject religion and its deities and all other mythologies, since they introduce unsupported complexity in their attempt to explain nature.

Gasp!\n\nWe have a choice:  (1) believe in things that are almost certainly made-up (including the 'safe' spiritual notions that are vague and so somehow less accountable to reason); or (2) accept that there are some things that we don't know.   In fairness, there may be a third option, which is to never fully acknowledge and consider the choice and simply accept the beliefs in which you were raised be default.

        "text": "Refuting the argument from morality by JW \n\nI am a writer and the admin/editor for www.atheistanalysis.com where this was originally posted. I was told that this subreddit would like this and you only take text.  So without further ado I present the mind of JW.\n\nTl;Dr The Euthyphro dilemma means morality is either arbitrary or god is NOT the standard, which makes him meaningless, and if objective morality exists, the universe is the standard, not God. Then JW proceeds to form a rudimentary utilitarian model as a potential front runner.\n\nA common argument for the existence of God put forth by theists is the argument from morality. For reasons I will explain later, many theists really like this argument. It is the main argument put forth by C.S. Lewis in Mere Christianity, and I have seen it proposed time and time again by Christians in many debates I have had. The gist of the argument is the idea that the only or best explanation for morality is God, and in its strongest forms, that without God, one has no basis for objective morality, and must accept a nihilistic universe. While I have no issue with the idea that the universe is nihilistic and our actions having no grand cosmic meaning, this framing sounds suspiciously similar to a god of the gaps argument; theists cannot explain the existence of morality, so they attribute it to a deity. While the exact argument can vary as there are many forms of it, the general format goes something like this:\n\nP1: God is needed for objective morality to exist (or is the best explanation for said morality in soft forms)\nP2: Objective morality exists\nC1: Therefore, God exists (or probably exists)\n\nThe best way to refute the first premise of this argument is the Euthyphro dilemma. This dilemma asks if commands given by God (or “the gods”, since it is of Greek origin) are moral simply by the virtue of being given by a god, or if they were moral because they actually have intrinsic value. Another way of putting it in this context is whether God deserves to be called omnibenevolent simply by virtue that he is God, or whether he is perfect and morally good because he actually exhibits characteristics in keeping with those traits. This dilemma leads to one of two possible conclusions, both of which undermine the credibility of divine command theory. \n\nIf the first prong of the dilemma is true, God’s morality is ultimately arbitrary, and has no bearing on the reality we live in. Actions are right simply because God has defined them as moral. If killing is okay according to God then it is moral, regardless of consequences. However, I am sure most of us would agree that this is absurd. Jean Jacques Rousseau, in his book The Social Contract, discussed the so called “right of the strongest” to force its will in morality. He argued that when force fails, what was once moral is no longer moral, so it makes no sense for morality to be based on force. Morality must instead be based on the willing submission of the people, because such a morality would continue to be followed even if force fails. While admittedly, God is technically immune to this conundrum because his power never fades away, Rousseau’s illustration shows the weakness of morality based on power. Just because God can introduce a cosmic speed limit to the universe does not make it “right”, because Rousseau points to a disconnect between the use of force and the moral value of rules. Just because one can force their will does not make it good for the people who are subjected to it. That being said, accepting the first prong of the Euthyphro Dilemma really adds nothing to the idea of objective morality existing. It just adds a supreme dictator of the universe who can force people to do whatever he/she wants them to do.\n\n\nThe other prong of the dilemma is that God’s commands are moral because they have meaning in something other than God, and that God, in his omniscience, has revealed them to us. The main problem is that this means God, in and of itself, is meaningless; he is just a messenger explaining objective morality to us rather than commanding it by his own virtue. If the universe is the standard for morality instead of God, it can be said by theists that God created morality, but at the same time, since the universe has already been set in motion, God no longer has control over what morality is; it must conform to his creation.\n\nNow, some theists will argue for a “third” option to Euthyphro’s dilemma, such as the idea that God “is” the standard. However, most of these arguments seem to fall into one of the two prongs of the dilemma. Either the commands are arbitrary and out of sync with the consequences of the actions themselves, or they are based on the consequences of actions, which make God irrelevant. In the case of God being the standard, God’s morality falls into the first prong of the dilemma if he is a different entity than the universe, or falls into the second prong if he is the universe, as would be the case in pantheism. Even in this case, any commands God gives would have to be consistent with his observable nature in this universe, which would likely debunk many of the holy books that theists claim God has revealed to them (after all, can it really be said that books like the Bible and the Quran really exhibit the best morality the universe has to offer?).\n\nThat being said, it is possible to refute the argument from morality based on the Euthyphro Dilemma alone. Divine command theory makes no sense because all God adds to the equation is force, which is a poor means for deciding the actual merits of morality, because morality is still arbitrary. On the other hand, if God merely explains morality to us, he is unnecessary and morality exists without him.\n\nIf the Euthyphro Dilemma debunking the first premise of the argument from morality are not enough, the second premise is just as flawed. Often times, when Christians talk of objective morality existing, they either are misguided in their convictions, or, as hinted at earlier, referring to a definition of objective morality that can exist without God.\n\nFirst of all, let us look at whether the theistic claims that morality is objective actually pans out. There are many cultures on earth, and many of them have very different ideas of morality. What we consider to be immoral is sometimes moral in other cultures, and vice versa. We might consider the things like the patriarchal culture of Islam as self evidently wrong, while someone in a Muslim culture might see our idea of equal rights for women as wrong. In both cultures we have certain moral principles ingrained into us from a young age; then, later as adults, we just see things as self-evidently right or wrong without closer scrutiny. Without finding a solid basis upon which to justify their beliefs, theists turn to God. In reality they are merely taking their ideas for granted and attempting to justify them by appealing to authority; in the end, their morals can be said to not be objective.\n\nSecond, when many Christians refer to an objective morality, it not so much that the claims are objectively moral simply because a God says so but because they see intrinsic merits in certain morals. Christians, however, cannot explain these claims without appealing to a god of the gaps argument, as mentioned above. While many atheists do not believe in objective morality at all, it may be possible to claim it exists separately of God if based on something that is objective, such as the universe. I think it is reasonable to assume the following things: that there are objective consequences to our actions in the universe that we live in, that there are some consequences of said actions that any rational human being would seek to avoid, and that morality is the regulation of behaviors to avoid such consequences and to encourage positive ones. If, for instance, we agree that things causing pain are normally objectively harmful to human beings and that morality is the regulation of behavior to avoid such things, then we can conclude that a form of objective morality exists. It may not be a cosmic, God-based standard coveted by Christians but it would be enough by which we can judge moral standards as good or bad for human beings to live by. \n\nGood moral standards will lead to universally preferable consequences, while bad standards would lead to pain and suffering (in other words, I am arguing for a basic form of utilitarianism). Technically, the universe is still nihilistic and actions do not really “matter” in some grand cosmic scheme of things, but to us and our individual existences, they matter very much. It matters to almost every rational human being if we die at age twenty from murder or die peacefully at age ninety after living a full, happy life. The avoidance of pain and the desire for the “good life” is generally universal in human nature, which is what makes it “objective.” We just differ in the means to accomplish such goals, and that is where “objective morality” runs into problems. There is no single standard that is universally preferable to all. People disagree and desire different and conflicting ways to accomplish the goal of living the good life. That being said, while the general inclination of morality is “objective” (or universal), individual moral codes are often very subjective and debatable.\n\nIn conclusion, the argument from morality is easily refuted when scrutinized. The concept of God does not justify morality by virtue of force, lest it be arbitrary and divorced from real world consequences. On the other hand, if God merely explains, in his great wisdom, the best path of morality for humans to take, he is merely playing messenger and it is not really God that matters, but the standard itself, which exists outside of him. Moreover, it can be shown that what most theists take for objective morality is largely cultural and taken for granted. If objective morality exists at all, it is based in the fact that there is a universe with objective consequences and that we humans can agree, at least on a very basic conceptual level, that there are some consequences that should be avoided and that there are some consequences that should be pursued. Even then, this is not much of a standard because it is more of a general goal that morality attempts to accomplish rather than a moral code set in stone. Finally, if such a theory is correct, then objective morality could exist without God, which makes the entire moral argument fall apart.\n",

Obviously as an atheist my argument was that children should only be introduced into religion once they are capable of making a rational decision on the matter, and that indoctrination is dangers and harmful.  The other parties felt that it is their duty as Christian parents (understandably) to instill Christian morals and values to their children at an early age.  My assumption is that children who are brought up as Christians are far more likely to be religious when they grow up, I'm aware of almost no cases of children being brought up without religion and then converting as adults.  Is there any data related to this?",

        "text": "This morning I had a middle aged gentleman and an early-adolescent boy come to my door with some papers and bibles. They came by this weekend while my wife was home and she said I might have some questions and to come back later. Introducing themselves, they said they had a pamphlet with some of life's biggest questions and were providing answers. \n\nHaving questions of my own, I let him finish and then immediately began setting the stage by making sure they agree with my interpretation of their beliefs (the god of the bible is the creator of all things, he knows all, sees all, is all powerful etc.. Jesus is separate from god as per the JW perspective, and so on).\n\nI have 5 questions I like to ask every theist I have a religious conversation with that allows me to figure out a bit more about what exactly they believe. They go as follows,\n1. Do you take the creation account of Genesis as literal truth?\n2. Do you believe in pre-destination?\n3. Why do you think there is/why does man commit evil in the world?\n4. Does faith or works get you into heaven? Or both?\n5. Of all the gods and religions of the world, why yours?\n\nI realized after my opening that I was not going to have any kind of productive conversation with them, since he stated that he was pretty much only going to answer any questions if there was an exact biblical response. The conversation devolved into him quoting scripture with me quoting it back to find the JW version either didn't have the verse, or the wording was slightly different from what I said, and, \"isn't interpreted that way\" (like Isaiah 45:7 for example).\n\nI ended up getting him uncomfortable by saying that Psalm 14:1 lies about me by saying I am not corrupt and he agreed with me earlier that some of the things I do and care about are noble and good for the world. He ended up interpreting me as someone who knows the bible but is struggling to believe, and he asked me to, \"gain more knowledge, and ask for more faith\"\n\nI wanted to come to a consensus on how to COME to knowledge (trying to move on to expose faith as a faulty epistemology), but he ended up saying he will drop off some special literature just for me in a few days and we can chat about the knowledge I've gained around the end of the month or so...\n\nNow tell me; am I wrong to try and crack this nut? Do you think it is worth it for me to get him to eventually give me some off-the-cuff responses and get him on faith vs reason, or genesis vs science, or should I just take the book, learn a little more about their cult for next time, cut my losses and give up trying to inoculate him?",

        "text": "This is a redo of a previous post here. I don't understand why atheists are pussy-footing around the issue, and furthermore presenting themselves in the defined parameters of theism---belief. \n\nTest case: I'm not sure how many Batman movies have every been created, going all the way back to the early 1900's. What if we somehow collected all these movies edited them into a single cinematographic script and called it \"The Holy Batman.\" \n\nIndeed our single homogeneous film would evidence many contradictions in Batman's portrayal, the things he said and did, his enemies, chronology, etc., but nothing that a good apologist couldn't explain with some hermeneutic chopsticks in hand. But that's not the point I wish to make here. \n\nIs this single volumed work (it doesn't have to be single volumed; we could keep them as let's say 3 dozen different Batman movies) prove that Batman existed? \n\nNow, since we are part and parcel to the very culture that produced these films, we know that Batman is our creation, for whatever psychological need he fulfills. But this is my point:\n\nIt is the very lack of knowledge about the cultures that produced the over 3 dozen different texts---Egyptians, Summerians, Moabites, Babylonians, Israelites, Persians, etc. etc. etc. of the ancient Near Eastern world each with their varying portrait of God, a god, be it Yahweh, Chemosh, Marduk, Osiris, etc. \n\nWhy under one circumstance can we say, based on the cinematographic evidence that Batman is the creation and expression of a particular cultural era, and we can't say the same thing or use the same evidence to argue the same point about god? Again, I believe it's because of our lack of knowledge about ancient Near Eastern culture. \n\nAs an atheist, I don't believe in the non-existence of god; I don't not believe. Belief has nothing to do with defining my atheism. I once couldn't join an atheist forum because they wanted a signed waiver stating that \"I don't believe in any god(s).\" WTF. Why is it about belief or non-belief? \n\nNow, as a PhD biblical scholar and student of the literature of the ancient Near East, I'd be willing to argue on purely textual and literary grounds that god or God does not exist. I see \"him\" created and re-created in all of the literature of the ancient Near East, like a modern-day remake of Batman ... speaking of which, isn't Affleck slatted for the next one? \"God\" is the product of a particular culture's expressions, hopes, fears, meaning, worldview, etc. \n\nContinued evidence could come from the fact that this process of re-creating god still continues. Not only is the revamping of a 1st century Jew as God a radically aberration of Yahweh---it's another deity in fact. But so too is our God of America---on purely textual grounds one can show that this is not Yahweh! nor Jesus! It's our own culture's re-creation. Aren't these proof enough that \"god\" is created and re-created by different cultures? ",

        "text": "I’ve been an atheist for pretty much all of my life. In the past few months, however, this line of reasoning for joining an organized religion has been making me very uncomfortable. I would appreciate if anyone could provide a legitimate refutation for it. If you are going to respond to this post, please read through the whole post first (sorry if that makes me seem dickish):\n\nLet us forget, for now, that there are two religions that preach everlasting torture after death for non-believers (Christianity and Islam) and assume there is only one. Let us name this religion ‘religion X’. Let us assume that ‘religion X’ does not require ‘belief’ in the conventional sense of the term, but rather ‘faith’- a willful suspension of rational thought and one’s best efforts to believe in an idea that has no evidence. A human being now is faced with decision of whether or not to put his or her faith into religion X. Let us assume that the probability of religion X being true is one in a billion. \n\nI would argue that a rational way to approach a decision is by determining the expected value of each option that you have. The expected value of an option is equal to the value associated with each possible outcome of choosing that option multiplied by the probability of that outcome occurring. \n\nWhen it comes to religion X, one has two options- putting one’s faith into the religion, and not putting one’s faith into the religion. Let us evaluate the expected value of not putting one’s faith into religion X. \n\nOutcome A: No faith in religion X, religion X is incorrect. This outcome is associated with finite positive value- a life of open-mindedness and fewer restrictions on one’s activity. The probability of this outcome is roughly 0.999999999. The contribution of this outcome to the expected value of choosing not to put one’s faith into religion X is finitely positive. \n\nOutcome B: No faith in religion X, religion X is correct. This outcome is associated with infinite negative value- an eternity of torture. The probability of this outcome is one in a billion. Nevertheless, any number, no matter how small, when multiplied by infinity, is also equal to infinity. So the contribution of this outcome to the expected value of choosing not to put one’s faith into religion X is infinitely negative.\n\nWhen one sums the two together, the expected value of not putting one’s faith into religion X is infinitely negative, no matter how small the probability of religion X being correct is. So the best decision, from an expected value viewpoint, is to put one’s faith into religion X. \n\nNow, of course, we deviate from the model, and realize that there are two religions that preach everlasting torture for non-believers, and that belonging to either one will damn you if the other religion is correct. Nevertheless, in order to reduce your chances of receiving infinitely negative value, this argument would say that you should put your faith into one of the religions. \n\nAny refutation to the argument warmly welcome! \n\n\n\nEDIT: The idea of a trickster God that punishes belief is definitely interesting. Does anyone have a refutation other than that one? \n",

As opposed to all the family and friends and their prayers of support, I've taken comfort in knowing that the surgeon is well trained, the hospital is top notch, and the technology is just plain awesome (real-time nerve conduction studies!) \n\nBut I find myself not knowing what to say. Not just to the well-wishers; I thank them for their prayers and move on, I have no need to be petty about things. And my wife is Catholic, so to her, the prayers and her rosary are very comforting. \n\nNo, I just keep catching myself about to say \"let's pray (the surgeon) does a good job,\" or something similar. Not because I have any believe in the power of prayer, or desire to seek divine intercession. But simply because I haven't found a suitable substitute in the atheist lexicon yet to convey that desire that all will go well. \n\nAll that is to say, I'll be glad when atheists have been \"out and proud\" long enough to have our own pet sayings, a way of lending verbal support and comfort that doesn't stem from Christian roots. \n\nThanks for reading. \n\nEdit:  as /u/Squeeker066 pointed out in his reply, \"it is difficult to know what to say sometimes, when everyone else so easily spurts out religious bullshit.\"\n\nI hadn't been able to articulate it, but this is it completely.  While I carefully consider my words, tailoring them exactly to the situation at hand, a religious person can spout off \"I'll be praying for you!\" and be done with it.  Requires so little effort on their part.  Of course, from an admittedly negative perspective, this is one of the beauties of religion, it allows the believer to abdicate rational thought, or just follow the path of least intellectual resistance.",

My wife's younger cousin just recently graduated from there, and is visiting from college for the summer. While talking to her this morning, I asked her how her experience was at that school and what they taught her. \n\nShe explained that they taught evolution and real science, both obviously good, but the real subject that caught my interest was philosophy. They were taught not only about other religions, but about their own from an objective viewpoint if there is such a thing. They were taught that the content of the religion is far outweighed by the good that it does in the community. A tool for bringing people together and teaching those who would otherwise have no access to education. \n\nThe way she explains it seems as it is preferable to NOT follow any religion word for word in a literal sense, if it causes harm to others. However the usefulness and relavence of religion lays with its ability to help people. \n\nWhat is your guys' take on this? Is it a ploy to stay relavent in a scientific world that demands religion either deliver on its promises or gtfo? Is the teaching of evolution and real science from a realization that they are necessary for a worthwhile education that transfers to college? \n\n**Cliffsnotes** - found out a popular catholic school in my area teaches evolution, science, and philosophy which mitigates a literal religious interpretation.",

        "text": "The fact that a person has a nice life and is happy does not make them special, \"blessed,\" or better than anyone else (especially those who are innocent and suffering and are very unhappy).  This life is nothing but sheer luck.  Therefore, people who do have nice lives and such, all that means is that they are lucky--nothing more.\n\nIn truth, nothing is \"special\" or has any of the value we give it since everything is pure luck and nothing more.  If this life were pure choice and allowed us to choose how we wanted to be born (such as how we want our brains and bodies to be and what lives we want to live as well as giving us the choice if we want a God and an afterlife), then that would make this life special with value.  But, again, since this life is nothing but sheer luck, that makes this life nothing special with no value whatsoever.\n\nEven the fact that we can make choices in life is a result of sheer luck.  For example, some people with depression have the choice of getting better while others are unfortunate and have no choice but to live with it and never get better.  For that very reason, I consider this a worthless life since it is nothing but sheer luck and that there is no God or a promised afterlife of eternal joy and perfection in which we can choose whatever we want.  I consider this life worthless even despite the fact that you can choose to make the best of it anyway.\n\nMy sole reason for being on this Earth was to be a higher badass being by dominating this inferior life of sheer luck and instead creating a superior life of my own in which I have choices of my own and can choose to have as little problems as possible.  But this inferior life has instead dominated me by giving me many problems such as depression and anhedonia that is never getting better.  So now, at this point, I consider life utterly worthless and my dominating and superior dream of ultimate status and power shattered.\n\nSince this life is sheer luck and there is no God or afterlife in which we can live a superior life of eternal joy in which we have pure choices, I consider not only this life worthless, but also me as a person and everyone else on this planet.  In truth, we should all just kill ourselves if we are living a life of suffering because, apparently, we are all going to die in the end anyway and it makes no difference if you were to kill yourself now or die from old age later on anyway.  Actually, you would be doing yourself a great favor.\n\nI am a cold-hearted bastard who is presenting the cold harsh truth here.  Usually, the cold truth would be from the result of scientific facts of reality.  But here, I am presenting the cold truth from a perspective of fantasy (having a life of pure choice and there being a God and afterlife, etc.) and applying that perception to reality despite the fact that I am well aware that fantasy is not real at all.  Again, to me, living a life of pure choice is the only thing that would make this life superior and worth living.  The idea of there being a God and an afterlife definitely applies here as well since, if there were an afterlife (heaven), you would be able to live a life of pure choices, eternal joy, and badassery (empowerment and superiority over an inferior life of sheer luck).\n\nTo me, it doesn’t matter how useful I am now. As long as I am unable to live a life of pure choices and such as well as a promised afterlife, I am inferior. It doesn’t matter how useful I am, as long as I am inferior, this is the reason why I consider myself and life worthless.  I am inferior to my ideal self (the person I wish I was which would be me having pure joy/empowerment and living a life of pure choice and such with a promised afterlife as well).",

        "text": "I don't really know what I hope to gain from this post but I'm lost and just need to talk.  I was brought up Lutheran and from around 2012 until a few months ago considered myself an agnostic Christian Universalist.  Since then I've completely lost my faith and in doing so I have become completely lost.  \n\nYou see, the things the church teaches you when you're young, to scare you, those things made a lasting impression on me.  I have suffered from OCD and delusions from a very young age, and so, when at the age of 7, I was told by my Sunday School teacher that I had to have a \"personal relationship with God\" to get into Heaven, I got really confused and upset.  Soon after, a change in my way of thinking would occur that affected me for the next 23 years of my life.\n\nFrom the age of 8, until this past summer, my most prominent compulsion through my OCD was compulsive prayer.  I'm not talking about having to recite certain prayers daily... I'm talking about HOURLY.  Every hour, of every day, I had to pray.  Scratch my balls, pray.  Notice an attractive woman, pray.  If during the ritualized prayer I had to scratch my leg, or someone interrupted, I had to start over.  During baseball games as a teenager I would constantly be taking my hat off in the field to compulsively pray because the Bible says that men should not wear hats to pray.\n\nA couple years ago, I started questioning things, right after my father died a slow, painful death from colon cancer.  So many people said so many things about God's plan, and I ate it all up.  I questioned things but ultimately could not get away from the fear that I was raised with.  I bought into Pascal's wager, and basically was in denial about how flawed such an idea was.  I shed any belief of hell and clung to my own version of Christianity.\n\nMy faith took a tumble that I would never recover from about 6 months ago, when I was on Facebook, and saw a prayer group for a teenage girl clinging to life.  Out of nowhere I had the thought, \"how many prayers does God need to heal this girl?  1000?  10,000?\"  from there it was downhill... \n\nThen in late March my mother was diagnosed with lung cancer.  Just 2 years after losing my father, my mom become terminally ill.\n\nTwo weeks ago I became an adult orphan, at the age of 31.  Again, I heard so much about God's plan, in a better place, etc. etc. etc.  My mom was a true redemption story, because she struggled with addiction, overcame it, and became a model AA mentor.  All along the way she credited God 100% with it.  I don't know how to view that, because it helped her, but she never gave HERSELF the credit she deserved for overcoming it.  She became an inspiration to those around her and her last few years of life on this Earth were amazing, she was a changed person, and our relationship was stronger than ever.  She had left me as a teenager and in the past few years we reconnected and became closer than we ever have.  \n\nI know this is a long post without much direction... but I am just so lost... I'm so tired of people telling me this is God's plan.  Even if there is a God, and even if he \"needed\" my mother, having her slowly choke to death as tumors collapsed her lungs, and then having her become so emaciated that her own grandchildren, my children, looked at her and knew she was near the end... having her in so much pain that there were times that she was so high on morphine she could barely talk... what God would have such a plan?\n\nNo... my mom died of lung cancer, most likely because she smoked for 35 years.  That doesn't make it any less tragic... she was a good woman with a bad habit... we all have bad habits...but even if I were still a Christian, saying this is somehow God's plan is ludicrous.  \n\nAgain, sorry for the lack of direction in this post... I just feel so alone.  I have a wife and two small children (too young to understand what's going on), and they are amazing... but they don't understand what I'm going through.  My wife is an amazing woman, but she also has a strong faith, so she doesn't understand how it feels to believe that the two people that brought me into this world are gone... not spirits, not in Heaven, just gone... and I don't blame her... she is a great companion, she believes in God but doesn't push her beliefs on me, she doesn't say cliche things like \"in a better place\" or \"God's plan.\"  \n\nI almost feel guilty for feeling so alone, just because I feel like it's unfair to my wife, who is there for me.  Nobody understands though... everything that linked me to my childhood is gone.  I can't ask \"oh hey, when I was 4, what was my imaginary friend's name?\"  or \"what was my favorite food when I was 6?\"  It's just all gone, in the blink of an eye.\n\nI really feel if I didn't have the wife and kids, I'd be in a gutter somewhere, with empty vodka bottles around me.  But I still feel lost.\n\nI guess the point of this post is to ask for how you grieve when everything you knew to be true goes up in smoke.  I'm afraid to even tell anyone in my family outside of my wife about my lack of faith, because they are the conservative Christian sort.\n\nTL;DR: Lost, ex-Christian, both parents died in past couple years.\n\nEDIT: Wow, you guys are awesome.  Thank you for all the kind words.  I am currently seeing a shrink, I just had my second appointment today.  I saw a therapist a few years ago who diagnosed me with OCD and GAD.  I am also on Zoloft, which has helped me with some of my compulsions.\n\nAlso, I have to say this.  For a long time, as a Christian, I wondered where atheists got their morals from.  After spending some time on here, as well as getting to know several atheists in my personal life (moved from small town to outside a big city), I am ashamed I ever questioned the morality of atheists (based solely on atheism, there are good and bad atheists just like there are good and bad Christians/etc).  You guys are some of the kindest and most understanding people I have encountered.",

        "text": "I grew up Methodist in Texas and as is typical in that upbringing I went to church/bible camp almost every summer starting as a pre-teen.\n\nIn high school, I went to a work camp for teenagers where we would build things like wheelchair ramps for people in poverty. We slept on air mattresses in local churches, often 30-40 kids and 5-6 counselors crammed into a single Sunday school room. You were assigned to a small team of about 6 kids per counselor and you would go as a group to house to work all day. Over lunch you'd do a bible study. We would stop at a local high school on the way home to shower around dinnertime, and then the evening would be spent doing typical camp things.\n\nI was a bit of an outcast in my youth group because I didn't put up a facade for church. I was just myself. I had a few friends but I wasn't part of the \"in\" crowd. I was happy though and enjoyed going.\n\nWhen I arrived at the camp when I was 16, I was immediately drawn to a kid from one of the other churches. He was very feminine and the other kids with him obviously didn't want him there. This struck a chord with me. When they called out the groups, I was delighted to find out we were in the same small group. I'm a straight female and he was a bisexual male. \n\nWe hit it off immediately and for the rest of the camp we were inseparable. The leaders of the camp, obviously unhappy that such a kid came to their conservative Christian camp, were out to get him from the start. They stood there in the corner and talked about us. They'd walk behind us as we were going places to try to overhear our conversations.\n\nAt one outing, we went to a country club to swim in the pool. I was kicked out of the pool by the camp leader for wearing a suit that was \"too revealing\". It was a tankini. He got out of the pool with me and we went to find somewhere to chill. Again, they followed right behind us to try to catch us talking bad about them.\n\nWe had such a good time and I just couldn't understand why they hated him so much. He was a good person and a blast to hang out with. I started to question why I should follow the footsteps of people that treated someone like this and his friends so badly for just being themselves.\n\nI don't know where he is today. This was about 12 years ago. Maybe he'll read this and know it's him. I hope he is okay. I'm glad he was there to make my week so much more fun, and I hope I made his summer better as well.\n\nIt's a tragedy the way LGBT teens are treated by the religious in this country. This is one of the first things that made me question the church and eventually led to my atheism.",

        "text": "The Historical Jesus is not a sufficient condition for today’s Christianity, the only kind that’s really left after [Docetism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docetism) was squashed as a heresy. But it *is* a necessary one. Without the flesh-and-blood existence of this itinerant preacher walking around Galilee two thousand years ago, Christians are left with no character they can dress up in the robes of their Christ of Faith.\n\nThat simple observation, coupled with the fact that most scholars of Jesus and the New Testament are Christians or embedded deeply in Christian culture, explains why there is so little attention paid to the **Christ Myth Theory**. It is the idea that there actually never *was* any Jesus, certainly not the one the Bible talks about. Instead, this still-unpopular alternative proposes, the Jesus character grew out the same imaginative thought process in the ancient world that gave us the Greek and Roman gods with their amazing powers and exploits, and the heroes of ancient novels with supernatural acts that included raising people from the dead and being so raised themselves. There may have been some sand grain in the oyster, one ordinary preacher or supposed miracle worker among the many wandering around the Levant back in those times, that grew into the astounding figure of Jesus. But he wasn’t the guy described—with ever-growing divinity as the manuscripts get later—in the Gospels.\n\nAnd so we have a Jesus-Industrial complex of apologists and pious scholars working to keep Christians’ doubts at bay (occasionally they also manage to convince an outsider), and they are able to operate largely without defending or even thinking too much about their pivotal assumption: That there actually *was* a Jesus. But, it turns out, that assumption deserves some serious scrutiny.\n\nA recent book that provides it is *There Was No Jesus, There Was No God* by Raphael C. Lataster. My review is here: “[A Christ-Myth Carol](http://blog.edsuom.com/2014/08/a-christ-myth-carol.html).”\n",

Everyone (I think) hopes this will be some kind of re-conversion experience for us.

They are *good* friends, but it's not like he's going to be this **big ongoing influence**\n\nOriginal Post Follows:\n\nBit of a rant, but I wanted to tell someone.\n\nMy alt-account because of friends on reddit that don’t need to know this…\n\nI’ve agreed to this for her sake, and I’m going to be lying through my teeth for the next few months to dozens of people while going through marriage preparations, and more importantly I think, while saying my vows.\n\nMy family is Catholic, my fiancée’s family is Catholic; they all want us to be married in the church, obv. More importantly, one of my fiancée’s best friends is a deacon in the church, and we are going to be his first wedding. That’s why this is her dream wedding.\n\nI have been an atheist for about 16 years, and I think my extremely conservative Catholic upbringing (homeschooled and Catholic school for 12 years, forced to attend mass and confession…being taught about the “homosexual agenda”, science education suppressed, living with constant guilt, etc.) was the single worst thing that has ever happened to me. Fiancée is a deist, and she is well aware of the resentment I harbor against the church; she is very grateful I’m doing this, and while I mind, I am willing.\n\nThe marriage preparation within the church is nuts! For starters, we’re being counseled on how to live in our married life by a celibate man only a couple years older than us. We’re being sponsored by a “Canaanite Couple” (a married couple within the parish), that we get to have all kinds of friendly dinners and activities with while discussing why their marriage is so much more meaningful and stable than secular couples (it’s not). We’re going on a weekend marriage counseling retreat with other engaged couples to learn all about marriage within the church and “Natural Family Planning” and why actual effective contraception is sinful.\n\nGetting back into this indoctrinating echo-chamber, that is so obviously homophobic and so so so structured around traditional gender roles is strange but familiar to me…\n\nI’m lying to all of these people. It’s convincing because I am so familiar with the Catholic mindset, doctrine, etc. I’m going to continue this for months, and then I probably won’t see any of these people again after the wedding because I think the church is a net force for evil in the world even if it was all true, and I don’t want to associate with it.\n\nI don’t even feel bad about it, except that bailing after getting married might give atheists (or whatever they think I am) a bad name. Also we’re not giving the church any money except a $300 booking fee…which I think is reasonable.\n\n**TL;DR: Former Catholic, now atheist, getting married in the church. Lying through his teeth to dozens of people, convincingly, and wondering how anyone could think this is the best recipe for marriage.**\n",

Atheists are selfish, self-absorbed, greedy jerks. \n\n&gt;3. Atheists are cocky, self-sure, and totally enamored with their own superiority. \n\n&gt;4. Atheists will openly threaten you\n\n&gt;5. Atheists are clearly incapable of love.\n\n&gt;6. Atheists lack ethical boundaries\n\n&gt;7. They disbelieve in God because something bad happened to them. \n\n&gt;8. Atheists are angry at God. \n\n&gt;9. Atheists are miserable because they believe life is meaningless. \n\n&gt;10. Atheists have no basis for morality.\n\n&gt;In the end the central injustice of this movie is its failure to fairly represent a class of people whom Christians purport to love.  *But it’s not loving people well to misrepresent them this badly.*  This movie caricatures, dehumanizes, and depersonalizes people like me, portraying us in the worst possible light.\n\n\\-----\n\nMore details in the original -\n\nhttp://www.patheos.com/blogs/godlessindixie/2014/08/05/what-i-learned-about-atheists-from-gods-not-dead/\n",

As such, the university have now announced plans to provide two new locations for dedicated Muslim prayer for the next academic year. The two sites chosen are an outlying building used primarily for exams and seminar classes and the bottom floor of the main university library which is currently used for AV training and extra resource storage. \n\nWhilst I have few problems with with the university providing facilities for religious students, one issue that sits very uneasily with me is the fact that structural remodeling will be undertaken to design gender-specific entrances in each location. I understand that this is seen as a major requirement in many mosques, but I'm unhappy with the fact that the university is spending money (contributed in small part by my tuition fees) to build segregated entrances for different sexes.\n\nI'm considering making a complaint to university authorities or raising the issue amongst my peers, but a part of me is unsure whether the right of Islamic students to pray in a space with religiously-mandated segregated entrances should take priority over our university's general commitment to end discrimination on the grounds of sex, race and creed. For context, the university is located in the UK.\n\nAny thoughts or comments you have on this situation would therefore be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",

Let me give you an example; if person A approaches person B and talks about their spirituality towards themselves.  Person B might completely misinterpret what person A is saying simply because they have different interpretations of what spirituality IS. There's no real communication going on unless you go in depth into what the word spirituality really represents in their mind to really understand what they're saying. This simple problem is where I believe most problems begin within this conversation.\n\nIf individual people that belong to the same religion interpret the word differently, how and where does the conversation start? If one Christian interprets spirituality as reading the bible, going to church, faith in God and the literal interpretation of the bible and another Christian interprets spirituality as loving all of earth and its creatures equally with a metaphoric interpretation of the bible. How can either off them really describe there own beliefs. This lack of unbiased definitions makes it very difficult to understand what most theist are talking about.",

This happened the other night, where I was trying to discuss the influence of religion on the pro-life crowd, and how unfortunately that set of beliefs have been determining legislation in my state. I merely criticized the radical religious groups for not seeing reason, and for being blinded in regard to other people's beliefs. My mother then took it upon herself to say that we are a religious nation and that certain beliefs should be respected (utter bullshit in this regard). My sister also called my non-belief bullshit, right to my face.\n\nFor the record, I try not to bring up religion around my family, and I most certainly try not to start fights about it. Whenever they bring up religion, I stay quiet, and even when they don't they still use it as a weapon in order to knock me down during an argument, no matter the topic.\n\nIs there any other way I can deal with this? I'm so sick and tired of being disrespected in this regard, and I hate that they're allowed to pick at my set of \"beliefs\" but I'm not allowed to berate them for theirs in return.\n\n",

The whole heaven/hell thing wasn't so much a motivator for me since I was assured that I would go to heaven, but the guilt that I knew I would rack up over a lifetime I knew would be weighty.\n\nI knew that I did things either purposefully (with full knowledge of the impact), childishly (without fully knowing), or out of ignorance that injured others.  I always had a keen sense of guilt and empathy for others.  I remember feeling guilty over causing my parents to lose sleep or my great-grandmother to rouse from her comfortable chair to give me tea.  As I got older, I knew my trespasses became greater.  Hurting feelings, withholding comfort, competing for resources, etc. were all weighing on my conscience.\n\nI would replay scenes in my mind where I had given some offense, but as a couple of days or weeks would pass, I found it hard to approach the person to apologise.  Either the timing was wrong, the situation felt odd, or sometimes to say you were sorry would open a wound and you could be punished.  My family punished many times out of anger, which could easily turn to rage.  So I avoided the apology and suffered with the guilt.  This was where god came in...  If I didn't feel I could approach someone or if they were already dead, I could ask god for forgiveness.  That act of acknowledging my guilt and asking for a weight to be lifted from someone external to myself seemed to help to a point.\n\nNow that I'm an atheist, I realize I alone am responsible for my actions and only those who I've offended can offer me forgiveness.  I try to make amends for my old debts, but sometimes the guilt still stays with me.  I especially feel bad about being too harsh with my children, not being around for my parents, not protecting my sister enough when we were young...  I know these may be common issues, but I'm having problems dealing with them.  It's like having a debt that can never be paid.  \n\nIf I asked a pastor how to deal with guilt, he might say 'Give it to Jesus'.  It always seemed like code for 'Sweep it under the rug'.  Does anyone have any insight on healthy ways to deal with guilt?",

I am not asking for help with my relationship in that sense, I can handle that area as it comes. I am most worried about what she wants to teach my child.\n\nNow, before I continue, I must say that she and her family are not crazy religious. They are very religious, but not the kind that would ban things like Harry Potter, for example. Right now she lives with her parents and my daughter, and I visit as often as I can. In this environment they are very patient with her, and her mother and me. Very nice people. They teach her to be thankful and polite, as polite as a defiant two year old can be.\n\nI really don't mind that they are obviously going to be raising her to be christian, I was raised christian as well. It is a little awkward if I must admit. My ex, knowing my views on religion, would ask me things like \"Do you think she sees angels?\" when she was a couple months old and was looking around the room in wonderment. She believes that our daughter from birth knew God, and Jesus. When we eat, my daughter now looks to me and asks me to pray with them before eating. All of this is...awkward. I will put my hands together and just watch her as she she prays with the family, all while my ex is glaring at me when I show signs of hesitation. I feel like these situations are doable for me, I just need to show tact, and be polite. They obviously want her to be a good person, which I am all for.\n\nAll that aside, what I most need help with is the fact that they are very much subscribed to creationism. I am almost afraid to ask how much, as in young earth or whatever. I can't even talk about orbital mechanics around my ex because she will start thinking I am talking down to her and her belief that the earth was created by God. They are just arguments I am not equipped to handle. I am very bad at arguments. I have trouble expressing my side and am careful when I talk because i realize how frustrated I get, and i don't like getting angry over things like that. \n\nI had literally never heard of creationism until I was at least twenty-two. (i'm twenty-six) I went to a christian private school as a child and everything, Lutheran, if that matters. The whole thing sounded so new and silly to me, and everything that I was reading about what they believe just made me shake my head in how silly it all was. That was until I brought up the silliness of young earth creationism around my ex...she...got...pissed.\n\nIt was since then that I have had a part inside me that was always uncomfortable thinking about what they were going to push on my daughter and her easily warped mind. around the house were magazines about creationism, she got a dvd from a family member on the ex's side that was about dinosaurs through creationism. Noah's ark and dinosaurs were in the same sentence on the front. They have family members who work at the creationist museum.\n\nI have no idea how to handle this, besides keeping my mouth shut out of fear of fighting with her. That whole side of my daughters family are all very religious, and likely believe in creationism, and that will be her life. While, on my side all she has is me. Her father, who isn't going to be married to her mother, and won't be there every hour of every day, even though I really wish I could. She will get a new dad, who will believe in the same crap as the rest of them and I am all alone in this wish that my daughter not be raised to be ignorant. and proudly so.\n\nSorry about the wall of text. I have wanted to type this all out for quite a while, but I never know what to type. and always feel foolish trying to ask for help with anything.\n\n/edit: I think I need to clarify, after reading some comments. I have no problem with her family raising her religious, they are good, kind, and I was raised in a similar manner. Her being raised christian is not a problem. The thing I was having trouble wrapping my head around a plan was the creationism part. everything else was just background...maybe useless background, but background nonetheless.\n\nAnd thank you all for the replies!",

In summary, she said that your opinions on religions, and life in general, can drastically shift depending on the current conditions of your life.\n\nNow, personally, I think that religion was a necessary part in initial human development. Agree with me or don't, but I think that religions did a good job in establishing basic human law. Things like don't murder, steal, respect your elders. Ancient religions like that of the Egyptians explained why things in the world came to be, like the sunrise, rain, conception, etc. And of course, it gave people some solace and comfort about death.\n\nNow, in a more modern world, I feel religion is mostly not necessary. It did it's job, and now that we can scientifically explain the world's functions I think it draws the world back more than it pushes it forward. Controversial issues like abortion, gay marriage, and stem cells would have never become such hot topics without religion.\n\nNow that I've laid down my background information, I ask again: How is your life? I am a young man, living a good home, in a good neighborhood, with a good job, coming from a family that loves me (albeit they don't know my beliefs), and I have a good group of friends. Life has bumps, of course, but all in all I don't have any major worries at the moment.\n\nAnd then I look at my parents, who have now both entered their 50's. They've become noticeably more devout. They volunteer at church multiple times a week, my mother makes Facebook statuses about Christ, they host Bible study groups, they make snarky comments about other religious views and lifestyles. I can't help but think that they've become so religious due to concern for their age; that they have to set things right before their time.\n\nTen minutes ago, my parents were talking about how their church converted over 1,500 people to Christ whilst on a mission trip in Africa. And I thought about how the needy, who do have worries, would put stock in a cosmic entity rather than look at life with a more logical perspective. It gives them hope; it gives them something to thank when good things happen.\n\nI guess there isn't really any kind of point I'm trying to make. I'm still confidently atheist, but I'm interested in seeing a discussion about why some people may still cling so strongly to religion as a result of the conditions of their life. Are there atheists posting here who are currently in a rough condition? How does religion affect your life?",

My group of christian friends were certainly educated intellectuals and could argue all day about god, the bible, and the history of christianity.\n\nI'd like to make a point to atheists that may not have much experience in the world of christianity.  You have to first start at the reliability of the bible.  It doesn't matter how strong your logical case is against god.  Lack of visible evidence doesn't mean anything to christians(it assumes a characteristic of god that the bible doesn't necessarily claim).  Even if you could convince all christians of the facts of evolution, it wouldn't contradict the bible.  They would just reinterpret.  \"God used evolution in creation.  Genesis is a metaphor.\"\n\nI went to a bible college and had history professors beat into me how the bible is more reliable than any other comparable historical book.  I'm realising now through my own studies that this is not universally agreed upon...  They are getting their history and science from, go figure, christian historians and scientists.  Unfortunately, I don't know where to turn to learn more.  As I have conversations with old christian friends, I realize that I can't get past the bible.  It doesn't matter what I say, they can just turn to the bible.  It's all there.  It explains everything for them.  They believe in it's absolute inerrancy and historical reliability.  It is there only tool and insight into the god that they worship.\n\nAll of that being said.  Can we discuss the reliability of the bible?  Who wrote the old and new testaments?  The bible is a pretty long book.  Did one crazy man just write the whole old testament and a few others the new?  And how did they gain any credibility for it to be taken as the word of god? What do actual historians say about the historical jesus?  What about prophecies?  Eye witnesses? And so on...",

        "text": "Recently in my life, my views on religion have gotten me into social trouble. People have a problem with me being an atheist sometimes and I'm not sure why. I don't go out of my way to express my views onto others. I never even feel the need to share that I'm an atheist when discussing religion. \n\nSome of my friends and family members automatically think of me differently when they find out I'm an atheist. They assume I'm some cold and hateful person that wants to tear down their world view. I can't even browse Reddit without seeing atheists being mocked. \n\nHow can I show my peers that being an atheist doesn't equate to being an asshat?  ",

        "text": "In my atheist life I have encountered a few different types of non believers.  While the end result sounds the same, to me they are vastly different.\nA.  The begrudging atheist.  ie. Someone who was deeply disappointed by religion, so much that they stop believing.  Prayers never answered, bad luck blamed on god, and observations of faithful hypocrites fuel their motivation to denounce all religion.\n\nB.  The unsubstantiated atheist.  ie.  Someone who claims to be atheist, but doesnt know enough about the world to truly understand why. Possible reasons: particularly identifying with atheist friends, not fitting in with certain religious individuals, or feeling cool and rebellious.    \n\nC.  The thinking atheist.  ie.  Someone who came to their conclusion through knowledge and reason.  Decent understanding of the sciences, sees the contradictions between all religions, is objective enough to come to an intelligent conclusion.\n\nI post this because to me, its not the end result that is important.  Knowledge of the 'world' and all life in it seem to be a prerequisite to claiming non belief.  Sadly, I see many people who claim to be atheists, but came to this conclusion for the wrong reasons.",

However, later down in the comments, the individual who had the experience states that [the experience changed her](http://www.reddit.com/r/shrooms/comments/2cdpsh/first_time_taking_heroic_dose/cjejgqo), and that she is [no longer atheist](http://www.reddit.com/r/shrooms/comments/2cdpsh/first_time_taking_heroic_dose/cjei25x).\n\nIn particular for how well researched she claims to be, this is shocking. How a single experience can just throw things out the window so quickly and fly in the face of reason/logic (I hate using those terms, but I'm not sure what else to use). I've experimented with shrooms several times before (though nothing this profound), so I do know how powerful they are.\n\nThoughts on this? Personal experiences?",

What I mean is this: an objective fact is something that just is, unemcumbered by any feelings or thoughts in the part of the observer. Example: the earth is not a flat square. This is an objective fact, no matter how much you might be biased against it. You can fly into space and see it . You can travel around the world and see it. You can look at the moon and see it, etc. It can be observed, tested, verified in a myriad of ways no matter how you feel about it.\n\nIn that way, if there were such a thing as an objective moral rule, how would you find it? How would you test it? Observe it? Verify it?\n\nWhen people speak of objective morality, they mean a moral rule that remains plainly the same despite the opinions of anyone, much like the shape of the earth. But what would that even look like? Theist morality is not really objective, it is more accurately described as \"deity's current whim\" morality, since it must be constantly changed to form a halfway coherent apologetic.\n",

I gave them each a soda and they were on their way. Afterwards felt bad that I didn't go more in depth in the discussion with them and would love a redo. Another part of me thinks that with them not being adults I made the right call. \n\nMy question is two part: \n\n1) How would you respond to this in this instance?\n\n2) What are your thoughts on sending kids out to do this? \n\nEDIT: Thank you for all the thoughtful responses. The only thing I may do different in the future would be allow them their time to tell me about what the Bible says and then either ask them pointed questions about it, or bring up the many contradictions that will surely also be in the Bible. Sorry for the delay/lack of responses. Just had a baby so she takes up most of my time right now :)",
