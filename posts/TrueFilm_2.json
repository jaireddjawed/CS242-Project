        "text": "I am tackling a film that has been much talked about to propose an analysis that I hope is a little different. I worked a little bit on the concept of « person » and it is when I discovered that the word comes from the latin *persona* that I wanted to see the film. It gave me a special perspective because I was looking for something that I think I finally found.\n\nThe word *persona* in latin designates the *actor's mask*. The latter was used as a megaphone, the thing through which the sound passes (*per sonare*). In this perspective, the person is the social mask that one wears in society and the intermediary through which one communicates. It is a kind of abstraction that is added to us when we are seized by society. Another etymology links the word person to *prosopon* in greek (the face). Among the greeks, the slave (who is a human) is *aprosopon* (literally \"the faceless\").\n\nWith this in mind, what does Bergman show us in Persona? An *actress* who chooses in the middle of a play to stop communicating. An absolutely essential scene in my opinion follows in which a doctor diagnoses the actress, she tells her: \"***An abyss separates what one is for others and for oneself*** \\[...\\]. ***But one can be immobile, silent. At least one does not lie. We can withdraw, we can shut ourselves in. Then no more roles to play, no more grimaces to make, no more lying gestures***\". She adds \"*Each intonation, a lie; each gesture, a deception*\". From there it seems to me that this is what seems to be played out. The character of the actress ceases to be an actress, to play a role, both in the play and in life, by speaking. She does not want to disguise what she is by this means: she withdraws into herself and thus ceases to communicate and deforming herself in the eyes of others.\n\nThe rest of the film, from this angle, goes quite far. The famous shot where the two faces are mixed together shows well, I think, that making this choice makes us disappear (\"faceless\", *aprosopon*). It leads to the absorption of the actress by the others: her disappearance, her erasure.  \nI discovered, later, that in *L'image-Mouvement*, Deleuze seems to make a similar analysis of this shot. He writes :\n\n&gt;It is useless to ask oneself in \"Persona\" if it is two people who resembled each other before, or who start to resemble each other, or on the contrary a single person who splits into two. It is something else. **The close-up has only pushed the face to those regions where the principle of individuation ceases to reign**. They do not merge because they look alike, but because **they have lost individuation, no less than socialization and communication**. This is the operation of the close-up. The close-up does not duplicate an individual, nor does it unite two: **it suspends individuation.**\n\nIn my language, french, « person » and « nobody » are namesake, their both written « personne ». Y think this homonymy reveals quite much. There’s this little quote I found from the french jusrist Jean Carbonnier that express this idea : \"*Nobody* \\[\"Personne\"\\], *this word so marvellous of our language which says everything and its opposite. Who is there ? A person* \\[personne\\]*, nobody* \\[personne\\]\" (in frnch : \"*Personne, ce mot si merveilleux de notre langue qui dit tout et son contraire. Qui est là ? Une personne, personne*\".).\n\nBergman's film shows this, in my opinion: the way in which one *suffers from being erased behind one's person* but, on the other hand, that one exists *only as a person*. This tension, at the heart of the notion of \"person\" (an actor's mask, hiding and revealing us at the same time) is, in my opinion, also the heart of the film.\n\nNote that the film addresses many other themes as well and that many interpretations are possible. It has a strong psychoanalytical dimension for example: a woman who speaks and the other one who doesn't. The climax is the scene where the nurse tells her orgy as if she were telling a dream to her analyst. Important reversal: the patient becomes the carer.  \nWe can also see the particular treatment of the motherhood which is also an important dimension of the film (cf. the highly symbolic opening shot where the actress' son touches her face on a projection screen).\n\nBut I think both those interpretations relate to the one in the very concept of \"*Persona*\" which is also the title of the film !",

        "text": "I'm currently working on a video essay about Lynch and am fascinated by the recurring doubling that happens in his films. I'm wondering if there's any particular examples you think I should be aware of?\n\nPredominantly, I'm working on Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive and Inland Empire. (Spoilers for these below). It's a pet theory of mine that these are all fundamentally working from the same themes, with Mulholland Drive being the most complete (ironically, considering its production history).\n\nFor me, there's a few layers of doubles:\n\n**Plot** \n\n\\- Several of the films literally contain doubles; Fred / Pete in Lost Highway, along with their love interests; Betty / Diane in Mulholland Drive (plus Camilla Rhodes, both the replacement for Betty and the 'real' Rita); Laura Dern's multiple selves in Inland Empire\n\n\\- Plot elements repeat themselves within each film, often doubling back and layering over previous events - LH and MD's plot loops, IE's moment where Dern comes back and observes herself within the studio set etc.\n\n**Inter-text**\n\n\\- The films mirror each other in multiple ways: the Pale Man in LH / Cowboy in MD / Phantom in IE for instance\n\n\\- The films also mirror other films; the Cowboy as a Western callback, MD's relation with Sunset Boulevard\n\n**Para-text**\n\n\\- there's a layer of further doubling added by the parodies and pastiches of Lynch's work after its release; I'm thinking about The Simpsons' 'burns suit', Sesame Street's 'Twin Beaks', videogames like Alan Wake and Deadly Premonition.\n\n\\- and of course, Lynch himself has some filmic doubles, notably Gordon Cole in Twin Peaks, his self-named character in The Cleveland Show, and his recent appearance in &gt;!The Fabelmans!&lt;.\n\nIf we read Lynch's work as having a 'dreamlike' logic that ties into the idea of cinema as shared dreamspace, then these doubles also constitute part of the wider dreamspace around his work - sort of like those odd waking dreams where elements of dream 'plot' are reconstituted and reconfigured into new scenarios.  \n\n\nAny thoughts / additional double suggestions are greatly appreciated!",

        "title": "Review: \"B'Twixt Now and Sunrise: The Authentic Cut\" - Francis Ford Coppola's new cut of his maligned 2012 film \"Twixt\"",
        "author": "TheRealProtozoid",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/11glgq1/review_btwixt_now_and_sunrise_the_authentic_cut/",
        "text": "Okay, here's my long book report. I went back and forth between the versions for a couple of hours, but I may have missed some small trims here and there.\n\nFor those who have never seen it, \"Twixt\"/\"B'Twixt Now and Sunrise\" is a low-budget ghost story that Coppola made back in 2012. It was based on a dream of his (the best part of the making-of documentary is when they play his original voice memo recorded after the dream). It stars Val Kilmer as a \"third-string\" horror novelist named Hall Baltimore. While on a book tour in a small town, he is approached by the sheriff (Bruce Dern) with an idea for a book about local murders that he thinks involve a supposed vampire (Alden Ehrenreich). It starts out fairly comic, but Baltimore begins having dreams involving a murdered girl named V (Elle Fanning) and Edgar Allen Poe (Ben Chaplin), who provide creative inspiration and clues to the mystery.\n\nIt's a low-budget movie that received fairly poor reviews when it came out and contributed to the perception that Coppola was in decline (although I think the two films he made prior to it, Youth Without Youth and Tetro, are unsung masterpieces). Indeed, it feels *very* low-budget, and even the cinematography by accomplished DP Mihai Malamaire (The Master, Jojo Rabbit) sometimes seems a bit amateurish, as do some of the performances. Nevertheless, Twixt does have its fans. While I never really counted myself among them, I did find the movie interesting, and it had some really good isolated scenes. This new cut focuses on the good and mitigates the not-so-good.\n\nAs a side note, I believe Coppola used to tour with this movie and its composer, Dan Deacon, and they would do \"live\" presentations of the movie where Coppola would *edit the movie live* to live accompaniment by Deacon. How I wish I could have seen one of those performances! So regardless of this movie's reviews, it still deserves a spot in the history books for this detail alone.\n\nThe following review contains spoilers because I will be comparing and contrasting two cuts of the movie: the 2012 version known as \"Twixt\", and a new cut of the movie released on Blu-Ray this week called \"B'Twixt Now and Sunrise: The Authentic Cut\", which is about 8 minutes shorter by my estimation and contains numerous substantial revisions (but no new footage). The spoiler-free review is: \"B'Twixt Now and Sunrise\" is a much better version of the movie, and brings more sharply into focus why this is a surprisingly personal film for Coppola, as it deals with the death of his son in the late 1980s in a boating accident.\n\nI'll refer to the two versions as \"Twixt\" and \"B'Twixt\".\n\nThe changes:\n\n\\- The principle change is the movie ending four minutes earlier in the story. B'Twixt now ends with the scene with Hall Baltimore and Edgar Poe on the cliff. The only new footage in the movie that I noticed is the final shot of the movie being extended slightly to let the final moment linger, and the new title card appear before the credits roll. The final sequence is also edited slightly differently. In Twixt, we cut to Baltimore in the middle of Poe's final line, splitting Poe's line over two shots. Now his final line plays over one shot, and then we cut to Baltimore's reaction. This way, the second-to-last shot of the movie is Baltimore absorbing Poe's message before the movie ends. Helps it land, I think.\n\n\\- A little bit of the deleted final 4 minutes (V waking up in the morgue after Baltimore removes the stake from her heart) has been used earlier in B'Twixt, around 38 minutes in, when Baltimore is trying to begin his new book and he's doing impressions. In Twixt, he ends up in a reverie thinking about his daughter, then he goes to the morgue. The reverie has been replaced with a shortened version of the stake removal scene, presented as a fantasy instead of the daughter reverie. The daughter reverie is moved to the end of the movie and incorporated into the cliff scene. The music from the daughter reverie in Twixt replaces the \"Nosferatu\" song as the end credits music in B'Twixt.\n\n\\- Two sequences are combined. In Twixt, the process of Poe telling the story of V and the murdered children was split into two parts. After the scene where Poe describes his process for composing \"The Raven\", Poe tells Baltimore a little bit about the mass murder of the children. The rest is told at the climax. In B'Twixt, the story about the murder is moved to the climax of the movie and combined with the rest of the murder sequence. In combining the two sequences, Coppola also shortened them substantially. Trims include: making lemonade; Poe addressing the camera to say \"But the monster caught her and put her in chains in he vault\"; and all of the screaming as V is chained up.- When Baltimore visits Flamingo in B'Twixt, most of Flamingo's dialogue has been removed. Now he just recites French, Baltimore remarks \"You're educated. You know Baudelaire.\" Flamingo responds, \"I know the dreams of Baudelaire\", speaks some more French, and then the sheriff arrives. In Twixt, they have a longer conversation about the missing girl before the sheriff arrives.\n\n\\- In all, there are over four minutes of trims before the cliff scene, and another four minutes after it (besides the stake-removal scene which was moved earlier and substantially shortened).\n\nGenerally speaking, I think the trims made the movie more dreamlike. By withholding Baltimore's reverie about his daughter, we don't know much about what happened until the last scene of the movie. The same is done with the murdered children. By not connecting as many puzzle pieces until the end, I think it makes the middle of the movie more dreamlike, and the ending more emotional.\n\nRemoving the climactic scene in the sheriff's station/morgue was a good idea, too, because now there are no \"real life\" scenes after the sheriff realizes that Baltimore is onto him and hits him over the head. There are now no \"real\" horror scenes in the movie aside from that moment. It's left implied that the sheriff is the stake killer, but that's the only resolution we get.Also, by combining the two Poe-narrated Chickering Hotel scenes, and removing the final sheriff's station scene, the number of times we re-visit certain locations has been cut way down. I think this makes the movie feel bigger, because we aren't re-using locations so much. And it makes the narrative flow better and feel less episodic, especially in the second half.\n\nPretty sure the first 38 minutes of the movie are identical, although I may have missed some subtle nips and tucks. Also fairly certain there is no new footage besides the extended final shot.\n\nAnother great Coppola re-edit, imho. It's still not one of his major works, but it does feel like Coppola was being more emotionally and artistically authentic, removing the more commercial stuff and committing to making it an arty and personal ghost story. I would be very surprised if anyone preferred the original cut.\n\nDefinitely recommended that Coppola fans give this another shot.",

This was my first Altman movie, so maybe I lost out on some of the quirks and characteristics of his style that would help me make sense of the film. \n\nOverall, I understood the film pretty well, it's a fairly straightforward story in the end but obviously disguised by the various lies of the characters and confusing relationships portrayed. I think I understand the concept of Marlowe as a \"man out of time\", and how the first layer of the film is about Marlowe's virtuousness and morality contrasted against the deception and violence of 70s LA. I watched The Big Sleep (1946) a little while ago and have been watching various other noirs as well, so it's been nice to be able to trace the line between the classic noirs and neo-noirs. \n\nI really enjoyed the movie overall, the cinematography was stunning and the way the camera was constantly zooming and drifting gave it this listless feeling that was simultaneously a little dizzying but also magnetic. Loved how it emphasized little moments throughout the film and captured this energy of life and movement throughout the story. It was also incredibly funny. I loved how the warm cinematography and funny dialogue would suddenly contrast with the moments of tragedy and violence. \n\nA small discussion question I have is what do you think the significance of all the dogs (or animals, considering Marlowe's cat) is in this movie? There's quite a bit of time devoted to them. There's Eileen Wade's barking Doberman, there's the silly little dog who refuses to move out of the way of Marlowe's car, and then all the dogs in Mexico, including the wildly amusing shot where the camera follows Marlowe coming into town and then the camera continues zooming in past Marlowe and onto two dogs having sex. Is it just a representation of the \"dog-eat-dog\" world?  Are they moments of levity? Every scene with a dog is honestly pretty funny.",

While this might be a bit of an over exaggeration, the point has truth in it. Some of the characters in the film are rather grotesque sociopaths that could easily be found as a villain in a horror movie. The scene in which Casey Affleck’s character finds the murdered boy in the bath tub is more disturbing and visceral than most of what is considered horror these days. \n\n- Lastly, the strongest aspect of the film is it’s moral ambiguity. When a movie can make you question your own morals and force yourself to be put in an impossible situation, I applaud the filmmakers for not letting the audience off easy.",

        "text": "Something that shocked me about whiplash is how analogous it was to playing college football. Fletcher was a one to one recreation of multiple coaches on my team. My defensive coordinator acted exactly like that guy except for slapping people but even then the guy did go so far multiple players and coaches fought him. All the incredibly demeaning language, the homophobic shots at guys masculinity, being kinda nice just to be a super dick later. Breaking equipment just to make a dumb point. That scene where Fletcher cruelly makes those three drummers drum until one of them does it right, that happened quite a lot. Even learning about your family just to use it against you later. For example my coach saw my mom and sister and in an attempt to make me angry while I was injured he told me he’d rape them. That’s the kinda guy these dudes are. All of that makes this movie once of the most relatable movies I have ever seen even tho playing jazz and playing football are wildly different experiences. \n\nFletcher justified those actions to both himself and others in his vainglorious attempt to find the next Charlie Parker. Yet in his pursuit he’s left behind many people who probably were incredibly talented disillusioned with jazz. You never see him teach anyone anything about jazz. Which again harkens back to some of the coaches I saw. Guys who rarely taught but often bullied young men striving towards greatness and wanting to win. When the members of the jazz band interact with each other it’s always negative because that’s the environment he’s built. One of negativity. One where all mistakes are brutally punished. \n\nYet despite all of that Andrew Neymen wants to be great. He drums until his hands bleed. He walks away from a car accident to play in fletchers band. I fully understand that. I played with broken ribs and concussions. I dislocated my finger and it’s permanently disfigured cause I would take my cast off to give myself a better three point stance. I’ve seen plenty of other guys do the same. People sacrificing parts of themselves pushing their body to its absolute limits. All in a pursuit of winning and becoming great. \n\nUltimately, I think fletchers and my coaches method of teaching/coaching is bullshit. A tactic of small and petty men who failed to reach the heights they wanted and decided to be incredibly mean to those who remind them of who they were. My DC lead a terrible defensive unit that could barely even perform the simplest tasks. We couldn’t tackle or communicate hell we barely knew what plays we were suppose to run. Fletchers never produced Charlie Parker. The end of the movie does imply maybe Andrew is that guy. However, I see Andrew’s final incredible drum solo as a repudiation of Fletcher. Andrew’s hard work got him there. All those hours of listening and playing jazz alone got him there. Fletcher brought him up there to slam the door on any chance Andrew had of making jazz a career. A final humiliation. Yet Andrew used the moment as a fuck you to display his skills that he earned. My final analogy is that in my last game of my trash ass college career I actually made some plays. Cause I played ball like how my instincts said to, I stopped listening to my Fletcher. I felt that drum solo so deeply and that’s why I love movies cause it can extract those deep feelings. \n\nGreat movie, great performances and I really hope we leave fletchers in the past where they belong.",

        "text": "Unlike other genres (if you could call arthouse a genre), arthouse films don’t really have marketable hooks or easily digestible narratives, and mostly rely on the quality of the film and the director/cast involved.\n\nFilms with excellent dramatic performances with hyper realistic dialogue that explore human psychology and behavior, or avant garde experimental films that push the boundaries of filmmaking and allow for authorial expressiveness, or surrealist dreamlike non literal narratives that use metaphors to make thought provoking statements, or films with all those things. These films can’t really be enjoyed by a mainstream audience because of their challenging and cerebral nature. People of course want escapism in their entertainment, which of course there’s nothing wrong with, but it makes it hard to find an audience.\n\nOf course art films still have an audience and that audience actually watches great films, but is it enough to find an audience to just make an excellent film? \n\nIf a newcomer who hasn’t yet reached “auteur status” creates an excellent film with superb craftsmanship, can they just rely on a film’s quality to find an audience, or is there something else (that’s within reach for unknown filmmakers, so no a list actors) that comes into the equation? Is it just luck and completely out of your control? Are there any excellent films that just go undiscovered because the director didn’t get lucky? Or do all (or most) great films eventually get discovered?",

        "text": "[SPOILER DISCUSSION]\n\nHey all, \n\nI know JD1080 has had its moment as the focus of discussion earlier from the S&amp;S 2022 poll. And I'll not talk about the bulk of the movie or how great it is--I personally love it as a #1 pick, for both meme status and legitimate recognition of a great film. Instead I would like to talk about specifically the ending with those who've seen it. As a 'greatest film of all time', surely that includes an ending that can stand as one of the all-time great ways of ending a film. But to me, whenever I think about it, it's one element that doesn't unfold or give me more to appreciate over time.\n\nJeanne finally snaps, and kills one of her clients, then 'resting' for one last shot. So what does this action specifically as the ending mean as a resolution to the buildup of all those themes that have been talked about at length elsewhere? Murder is a kind of 'easy' way to convey melodrama or unrest in movies, but for a story this toned down it feels like a cop out to something that could be a 'snap' moment, but more effective beyond just 'she snapped and killed someone'. Has anyone else thought this is a bit cheap over time, or do people have explanations of why they think it's the perfect ending to a carefully crafted film?\nIf we're brainstorming possible endings, firstly we'll consider what I wrongly was expecting: I was spoiled at least that she attacks/kills someone at the end, and as I was watching it I honestly thought it was the son who'd be the victim at the end. It taps into a person who Jeanne's life of passivity is most connected to, and would be a deeply uncomfortable way for her to rashly break out of her cycle. But on the other hand, do we know enough of her character to really say she'd ever do that even when she snaps? Despite the strained, unreciprocated love in their relationship, at least she does actually care about him. I think. This could be put into question by having him as the one there when she decides to end it all. I get the feeling from the film, especially that baby sequence, that he's a huge part of her current 'trap'.\n\nA second approach that didn't require the staginess of murder would be an ending with the son where she just slaps the shit out of him or something. I dunno, it would be funny but also sad as a cathartic moment of snapping out of things. The guy already approaches saying some really sexist and creepy stuff right to her, and him continuing to show less respect towards Jeanne and women could be met with a totally out of routine attack from Jeanne, and a suspended moment afterwards like in the existing ending to cap it off. Something that at least rings more true and leaves more endings open beyond the plot's runtime. \n\nA third option that feels plausible to me is Jeanne leaving her life by... literally leaving it. Like she's going through her usual routines and then just stops, as the increasing moments of fragmentation of her rhythm comes to a conclusion. If she had a client coming she just ignores him, she doesn't even start her chores, she walks off somewhere we don't know. Even have lingering shots of the home completely empty. It's kind of suggested by the criterion cover art, so I might have semi-predicted this as an ending when watching it. But it's a more restrained ending that would fit into the emptiness of the film. Also this IS in fact the ending of another criterion film about a woman living in a miserable life for extended detailed scenes, that I thought hit hard. I won't say which, but if you know you probably know. \n\nJust a question out of curiosity, as I really haven't settled on JD's ending as an ending that perfectly encapsulates the film. Looking at its strengths, it is an ending that's meant to be the most shocking and upfront about comparing a quiet, subservient life to violence, which is a connection I feel was important to hammer home especially in a society where such a connection was not assumed at all. It just feels a bit rash. JD1080 falls short of being a 10/10 for me, and the ending might be one reason why. I hope some JD stans can come in and give more detailed comments considering why they think the ending works as the ending of a masterpiece.",

        "text": "Recently I've been binging all 11 seasons of The Walking Dead. I used to be a mega-fan and between the TV series and the comics, it's the corner of media I've spent the most time with. However, I lost interest during Season 7, and have been on and off with catching it live since Season 10.5. My girlfriend convinced me to do a rewatch, and we're currently at the point I left off on.\n\nMy understanding of film/television/storytelling has grown a lot since I was a kid, and this rewatch allowed me to pinpoint some of the reasons I lost infatuation with the show. The reason I'll be detailing here relates to its heavy dependency on the same handful of tropes (whether that be in writing or its presentation), and how this dilutes story progression, desaturates characters, diffuses emotions and overall undermines the show's legacy. ***Spoilers will be tagged, with Season # attached.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**THE PRISONER TROPE**\n\nThis trope is the most overused in the entire show. The protagonist(s) is captured by the enemy, disarmed, held at gunpoint, and after some back and forth, they're either spared, saved, or killed.  This happens \\~20 times in Season 8 alone, over one per episode. It's used to allow protagonists and antagonists to have direct conversations, making it easy to portray their conflicting perspectives and create tension. However, tension is typically diffused, as The Walking Dead only uses a handful of outcomes with these story situations. First, the protagonist(s) almost always has a lengthy discussion with their captor, thematic and character motivations are discussed. Then the protagonist(s) is either (1) saved right before death by an ally hidden from the enemy or a zombie ambush, (2) the protagonist knocks the weapon out of the captor's hand and escapes or (3) the protagonist(s) convince the captor to spare them. *Very rarely* do we see other outcomes, but when we do, they are reserved for the show's biggest moments. \n\nBest Examples Of Unique Outcomes\n\nSeason 3 - &gt;!Andrea unable to save herself from being bit!&lt;\n\nSeason 4 - &gt;!Hershel's Death!&lt;\n\nSeason 5 - &gt;!The failed hostage exchange for Beth!&lt;\n\nSeason 6/7 - &gt;!Negan brutalizing Glenn and Abraham!&lt;\n\nSeason 7 - &gt;!Sasha's Sacrifice, Eugene's spineless commitment to The Saviors!&lt;\n\nAlmost all the trope's subversions come in season/mid season finales, so the audience can easily predict the outcomes of the prisoner situations on almost any other episode of the season. This isn't necessarily an issue, as brilliant subversion can't exist without precedent, but considering how these prisoner situations occur 1-2 times per episode, it becomes extremely stale. For instance in S7 and 8&gt;!Rick is captured by Jadis twice, having to fight off metal covered walkers both times, and makes it out with a deal with Jadis's people, both times leading to Rick being screwed over. There is no emotional or thematic juxtaposition between these two events, and the second iteration is complete plot filler.!&lt; Not to mention the number of times that the protagonists can be completely surrounded at gunpoint, but manage to survive without a single casualty because of some distraction.\n\nWhat's the solution? Don't use this as an easy way to create stakes and allow opposing characters to have prolonged interaction, writing yourself in a corner because you can't kill off a character yet. With a situation like &gt;!Daryl's psychological abuse!&lt; in Season 7, it's necessary, but typically there can be unique and more effective directions. In Season 8,&gt;! I appreciate when Rick and Negan end up in the basement of some building, their heated conversation carried by echoes and amplified tension as they attempt to find the other (It reminds me of the finale of Heat). It could've been Rick capturing Negan, and Negan somehow getting away, but the filmmakers chose a more difficult but rewarding direction (especially since Jadis captures Negan later that episode).!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**UNEARNED DEUS EX MACHINA**\n\nThis is another extremely common trope used in conjunction with The Prisoner Trope. Frequently, characters find themselves in situations of inescapable death, but end up saved moments before their demise due to forces outside of their control. Typically, it's an unexpected character or group coming out of the shadows and gunning down the enemies (S7 EP16&gt;! Shiva jumping into frame moments before Rick and Carl's demise)!&lt;or walkers sneaking up out of nowhere to create sudden uncontrollable chaos (S9&gt;!Henry and Lydia's escape from The Whisperers)!&lt;\n\nNot only are these \"Acts Of God\" used multiple times in almost every episode (neglecting practicality and probability), but they almost always betray character development. It's uncommon that \"you're only alive because of luck/outside forces\" is the point being conveyed, and when it is, it's usually solely or partially viewed from the perspective of the \"saving grace\". When the *character(s) of focus* succeed despite their inaction, it rarely contributes to their growth. More often than not, it degrades characters, as they are absolved from their consequences because of other characters' decisions.\n\nAgain, these moments do have their purpose. It assists in terms of building relationships between characters that save the day for one another and contributes to the show's thematic principles of empathy, hope, and redemption. However, when used excessively this diminishes the stakes, as audiences expect characters to get out of most situations, and when the same characters constantly save each other (Daryl and Carol come to mind) it restates the same points about their relationship and prevents moments from standing out.\n\nThere are multiple solutions to this issue.  First, simply have the character's fate rest in their own hands. The show will do this by having characters knock their captor's weapons away moments before death, finding ways to cut themselves loose from bindings or convincing their enemy to spare them. However, the show is almost exclusive to these choices and often chooses solutions that don't align with the character. In S8 &gt;!Eugene making himself vomit on Rosita was an aligned, unique solution to escaping captivity.!&lt; But often, the characters typically make inconsequential decisions to escape captivity. In comparison, take an almost universally acclaimed show like Breaking Bad, where impossible situations lead the characters to take drastic, highly consequential actions, like &gt;!Walt crashing his car to avoid Hank finding out about Gus' laundromat, Jesse killing Gale to save him and Walt's life, and Walt and Skylar fabricating a confession to blackmail Hank. !&lt;Seemingly inescapable situations give characters opportunities to take drastic action, and it feels like The Walking Dead is afraid to have characters take major action without it being on one of the season's highlight episodes.\n\nAnother solution is to reconsider where these \"Act Of God\" moments are being perceived from. Deus Ex Machina moments feel more character motivated when seen through the perspective of \"the savior\". Even if it's a small glimpse, it's better to sacrifice some of the potential surprise instead of chalking it up to coincidence. Often, the saving grace hasn't been on screen for 20+ minutes, leaving the moment feeling hollow after the initial wave of emotion.\n\nIn conjunction with these solutions, I suggest attaching these moments to character turning points. One of the most rewarding moments of the show comes during S8 EP16 when &gt;!The Savior's guns self-implode, a direct action of Eugene's sabotage, the ultimate choice of his 1.5 season-long turmoil of loyalty vs survival.!&lt; Audiences can forego logical improbability if outcomes are significant and aligned with a character's development.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**HALLUCINATIONS AS DEPICTIONS OF TRAUMA**\n\nThis trope deals with the show's presentation as opposed to the underlying story. Naturally, this show deals with tragedy, and thankfully it doesn't sacrifice this aspect to make every character an impenetrable badass. Even the show's toughest characters show their vulnerability, and one of the contributors to the show's success is its long-term emotional depictions of the apocalypse. The most overused presentation of this is through hallucination sequences. While being unique, comparatively visually interesting detours from the show's traditionally grounded style, it seems that most characters go through a hallucination arc.\n\nTypically, these hallucinations come as former cast members reprising their role to haunt characters, vocalizing the emotional turmoil they feel inside. At times, it leans more into fan service, as characters are visited by those who were relatively insignificant in their development like in Season 5 when &gt;!Tyreese is visited by a bunch of former cast members, some seeming to exaggerate their connection to his psyche.!&lt; These moments are sometimes great, especially when used to tie up important loose ends and/or being creatively presented, but often these arcs are drawn out, restating the same points over episodes despite a general emotional/ideological stagnation.\n\nAnother issue with this is that the consequences of these hallucinations are frequently underrealized. It's limited to mistaking walkers for loved ones, being rude to other survivors, or letting something pass by you. These hallucinations rarely feel significant, as almost every arc resolves with little impact.\n\nSome of the show's most heartbreaking moments come from cast members' performance in the moment. Like in Season 5, &gt;!the group's reaction to Beth's death is one of the most harrowing moments in the show, and her impact is felt without a revisiting of her presence.!&lt; I don't expect trauma to always be depicted solely on a character's performance in reality, but it feels like acting without external dramatization is underutilized.\n\nOn top of that, I do think the hallucinations could be more subtle. There's clearly a push to make these sequences accessible and comprehensible to all of the show's audience, but there's not enough detail to reward a more active viewer. Additionally, I think they should go further with hallucinations that seem completely real, as I found these moments to feel pretty exciting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**THE OVERALL ISSUE**\n\nI say all this knowing that these solutions to story issues aren't as easily implementable as they are suggested. Clearly, the focus of the show was to maintain its position as one of the most popular shows in history. This becomes the most apparent when considering how long this show is. It's over  7 full days in length, averaging 16 \\~50 minute episodes a season over its 11-season journey. Repetition is bound to happen, and creating 15 hours of content almost yearly is incredibly difficult. Reincorporating tried and true plot points are more efficient than developing new avenues, and the show has some of my favorite film and tv moments to date. I would love to see an alternate universe with 6-8 seasons of 12 or less episodes, a smaller cast and more time for production. There's a lot of fluff, and it dilutes the overall legacy of the show that has some unforgettable episodes.\n\nI spent way too much time writing this, especially for finished show with producers that will never see this post, but I figured I'd write this to not only help me understand how I felt about this show, and how I can learn from it with my own work, but also generate discussion with others who may find this interesting.\n\nTL:DR The show had to hit unrealistic runtime expectations yearly, and overused story tropes to bloat its runtime and be more efficient in its production.",

        "text": "I enjoyed this little riff on Vertov, the disembodied eye, and the uncanny experience of seeing one's own decentered gaze. It's part of a larger theological essay that is also interesting but not explicitly to do with film.\n\nhttps://www.lacan.com/zizshadowplay.html\n\nKino-Eye /Kino-glaz/, Dziga Vertov's Soviet silent classic from 1924 (one of the highpoints of revolutionary cinema) takes as its emblem the eye (of the camera) as an \"autonomous organ\" which wanders around in the early 1920s, giving us snippets of the NEP (\"new economic politics\") reality of the Soviet Union. Recall the common expression \"to cast an eye over something,\" with its literal implication of picking the eye out of its socket and throwing it around. Martin, the legendary idiot from French fairy tales, did exactly this when his mother, worried that he will never find a wife, told him to go to church and cast an eye over the girls there. What he does is go to the butcher first, purchase a pig eye, and then, in the church, throw this eye around over the girls at prayer – no wonder he later reports to his mother that the girls were not too impressed by his behavior. This, precisely, is what revolutionary cinema should be doing: using the camera as a partial object, as an \"eye\" torn from the subject and freely thrown around – or, to quote Vertov himself:\n\n    The film camera drags the eyes of the audience from the hands to the feet, from the feet to the eyes and so on in the most profitable order, and it organises the details into a regular montage exercise. [10]\n\nWe all know the uncanny moments in our everyday lives when we catch sight of our own image and this image is not looking back at us. I remember once trying to inspect a strange growth on the side of my head using a double mirror, when, all of a sudden, I caught a glimpse of my face from the profile. The image replicated all my gestures, but in a weird uncoordinated way. In such a situation, \"our specular image is torn away from us and, crucially, our look is no longer looking at ourselves.\" [11] It is in such weird experiences that one catches what Lacan called gaze as objet petit a, the part of our image which eludes the mirror-like symmetrical relationship. When we see ourselves \"from outside,\" from this impossible point, the traumatic feature is not that I am objectivized, reduced to an external object for the gaze, but, rather, that it is my gaze itself which is objectivized, which observes me from the outside, which, precisely, means that my gaze is no longer mine, that it is stolen from me. There is a relatively simple and painless eye-operation which, nonetheless, involves a very unpleasant experience: under local anesthesia, i.e., with the patient’s full awareness, the eye is taken out of the socket and turned a little bit around in the air (in order to correct the way the eye-ball is attached to the brain) – at this moment, the patient can for a brief moment see (parts of) himself from outside, from an \"objective\" viewpoint, as a strange object, the way he \"really is\" as an object in the world, not the way one usually experiences oneself as fully embedded \"in\" one’s body. There is something divine in this (very unpleasant) experience: one sees oneself as if from a divine viewpoint, somehow realizing the mystical motto according to which, the eye through which I see God is the eye through which God sees himself. Something homologous to this weird experience, applied to God himself, occurs in the Incarnation.",

        "text": "I am teaching a college course on psychology and cinema that is a very introductory course and attracts students that are totally new to watching arthouse films. These are not film or film studies students and although one of the stated purposes of the course is to introduce them to a variety of arthouse/world cinema (so to an extent they know what they’re getting themselves into), many of them are accustomed to watching films only for entertainment and are not practiced at looking at film as art. Some of them announce early on in the course that they can barely stand watching subtitled films (!) but I try to encourage them to keep an open mind about experiencing film in ways that take them outside their comfort zone. \n\nI start with films that lean arthouse but are more accessible and “entertaining,” stuff like Almodóvar, and Jenkins’s Moonlight. I try to introduce the films in a way that will help them think about what the film is doing and accept elements that they’re not used to. (For instance, with Almodovar I’ll tell them he is exploring melodrama, that you may see exaggerated storylines that may not seem strictly realistic, emotional expressiveness that may seem overdone, that the film may feel soap-operatic and have elements that remind you of a low-brow telenovela but he’s attempting to elevate that to something that feels like art.) Basically I want them to think less about whether the films entertain them and remind them of things they already like, and more about “how the films are working.” They are also asked to apply concepts related to cognition and theories of emotion that I lecture on, and use them to attempt an analysis of each film that we watch.\n\nI should reiterate that this is not a film studies course and I am not a film scholar but film is one of my interests, and there is an interesting but somewhat obscure subdiscipline of psychology that focuses on the unique cognitive, social, and emotional effects of film. So that’s the course content and in getting them to practice that type of analysis I expose them to all of these different films from around the world. \n\nSo here’s the question. We are about to screen Persona, and I have to admit I’ve gotten a little nervous that they will reject it on the grounds that it is “boring” and/or utterly incomprehensible. How would you introduce this film to put students like these in the right state of mind? I know that no film will work for everyone, but I just want to maximize the possibility that they can receive and maybe appreciate it. Some of them said they felt lost and confused (and bored) even with something like Wong Kar-wai’s In the Mood For Love, so Persona feels like… a huge ask. But maybe there’s a way I can guide their expectations a bit so they won’t feel so lost at sea. Any thoughts or bits of advice are appreciated!",

        "text": "I just re-watched the film *Witness* starring Harrison Ford and Kelly McGillis. I saw this film as a kid and liked it, but re-watching it as an adult made me appreciate it even more. Things that stood out:\n\n* So many great scenes that are communicated through silent acting rather than dialogue. Two that stood out were when the boy recognizes the murderer by seeing him in a photo contained in a trophy case at the police department. Such great direction and acting by Ford, as he realizes what the boy is looking at and why, and the horror on Ford's face as a result. The second is when Ford explains to McGillis when she is in the chicken coop why he didn't make love to her the night before, then he walks away and she gives a look at him that communicates *so much* without any dialogue. About how she feels, their situation, and what she would be willing to do in that moment. I just love how the direction allows the actors to *act* and respects the audience's ability to follow. It's the definition of show, don't tell.\n* There is a romantic rivalry between Ford's character and the Amish man, Hochleitner. I so much appreciate that they didn't make these men enemies. They are competing for Rachel's affections, they know it, and it's an irritation between them, but that's where it ends. They work together in harmony in the barn raising scene, and I just love how at the very end of the movie Ford is driving away and Hochleitner is walking on the road towards Rachel's farm to once again try and woo her. Ford stops his car, and while the audience can't hear what they're saying, it's clear they have a nice conversation, then they go their separate ways. A lesser film would have found the need to play up their rivalry more, or to have Hochleitner be unlikeable.\n* I love the ending. There's the shootout at the farm, but the Chief (who is the main villain) is still alive and gets the drop on Ford. An alarm bell was rung earlier and a couple dozen Amish w/in hearing come to see what is the matter. Ford challenges the Chief and says to him, \"What are you gonna do, shoot me? Shoot the boy? Shoot all these people?\" And to the film's great credit, the Chief emotionally breaks down and puts the gun down. A lesser movie would have had him menace the group and Ford would somehow save the day and put him down. Instead the movie is resolved with simple reality. The Chief knows the game is up, he literally *can't* kill all these people and hope to get away with it. It's over, he realizes it's over, and he stops. From a pure action standpoint it's in some ways boldly anticlimactic. The catharsis comes from the Chief understanding how vile he has become, and him being held to account, rather than being killed or even beaten up by Ford. It also is a nice culmination of the film's theme of Amish community. These are pacifists, they are unarmed, but their power comes from their strong sense of community and in the end that is what resolves the conflict.\n\nThere are other parts that are great, like of course the barn raising and Ford and McGillis dancing in the barn, but the points above really stood out to me on rewatch. I just really appreciate how mature and restrained this film was.",

Or even antihero horror movies like Spawn are different than regular antihero movies. \n\nIt also forces the horror to change, the point of view is not of some defenseless people being chased hunted or spooked, they dont mean to scare you that way but you are going after the monster not the other way around. Evil dead 2 is not a superhero horror movie but Army of Darkness certainly is. \n\nI think its a hard genre to define so it got me wondering, which movie would be the first one can consider superhero horror? Is it Dracula ( 1958 ) where there is a focus on Van Helsing as a vampire hunter which Dracula has to fight face to face? \n\nWhat do you think?",

I've seen a few of these and can attest that they're mostly successful; Apocalypse Now theatrical is arguably still the best, but Encore is way better and Death of Corleone is less grating.\n\nI remember him talking about a new cut of Your for Youth, so that is likely coming at some stage, though he's likely busy working on his magnum opus.\n\nAbsolutely fascinating project, likely an attempt to improve the track record for posterity (something Coppola seems to care about).

        "text": "I saw *Phantom Thread* recently, and it left a strange taste in my mouth.  \nThe movie is impeccable in so many ways. Formally, it's a work of art: Paul Thomas Anderson has such an amazing eye for detail, for rhythm, such an astute sense for what makes a scene interesting, and his actors deliver amazing performances, that it's hard to take your eyes off of it. \n\nBut what is the movie really about? Like, what is the message or moral that it conveys? What values is it built on?\n\nOn its surface, the film is about a genius man-child whose relationships with women are a driving force in his life. \n\nIn that way, it's quite different from most Anderson films, which, with one exception, tend to focus on \"daddy issues\", the presence of a father/Father, their absence, their influence: men negotiating who they are and what they should do in relation to a Bigger Man or an ideal Manhood defined from the outside-in. So I was excited to see a film which focused so deliberately on \"mommy issues,\" as it were. And the movie doesn't shy from that, the idea that Daniel is shaped by his relationship to his mother, to his sister, and to the women around him much more than by the specific absence of a father-type is not accidental. \"Father\" doesn't even show up. (As a fashion designer/tailor Daniel exceeds, as it were, in a \"feminine art\", and his success or failure depends on the whims of women, their likes and dislikes, their ability to get what they want, and not on conventionally \"masculine\" notions business acumen.)\n\nBut what we have then, is this fragile boy, this beloved and respected genius curmudgeon, and the different ways women are woven into his sense of self. \n\nThe movie begins with Daniel treating his then girlfriend as a nuisance, someone whose presence interferes in the exercise of their genius; someone whose usefulness has faded; someone to be disposed of. Those around him are all too eager to indulge his egomania, as they recognize the fruit of it is inimitable art. His strength and his weakness, his talent and his fragility, are seen as twin engines of his brilliance. \"Let Daniel be Daniel.\"\n\nWhen Daniel meets and courts Alma, a waitress at a seaside restaurant he immediately recognizes as a potential muse, he is both pathetically vulnerable and smitten as well as commandeering, telling her what to do and how. He may be vulnerable, but he is vulnerable on his own terms, terms that are familiar to him: he's been here before, infatuated with beauty. \n\nAs their relationship evolves, Daniel takes full control of Alma's life: what she wears, where she sleeps, kind of like Pygmalion. But the movie is told from Alma's point of view, and, from her position, she doesn't see just this commandeering jerk, but instead a little vulnerable boy, someone whose weakness she can recognize, someone who needs her more than she needs him. She is special in that regard: where the other women were intimidated by Daniel, she isn't. She can say \"no\", and she can be the one \"writing the story\", as it were. She is not his victim, and certainly not expendable like the other women. Yes, Daniel is, for all appearances, the tyrant, and she wants to please and serve his art, but she is the one secretly in control, and this takes on the form of her literally poisoning Daniel in order to make herself indispensable to him. \n\nThe movie ends with Alma poisoning Daniel again, apparently with his full knowledge, and him being OK with that.\n\nDaniel is an unsympathetic character from the start, but I set it aside as the eccentricities of an artist, that this is what the subject of the film was, so the first thing that stood out to me as distinctly bothersome was the scene where Daniel takes Alma's lipstick off because he wants to \"really\" see her, as it were. it took me back to my early twenties, pleading with girlfriends not to wear makeup, that they were beautiful just the way they are, and that applying makeup detracted from it. Only now, twenty years later, does it occur to me to defer to a woman's sense of her own beauty. My partner's face is not my toy, their makeup is not for me. And this idea that \"my woman\" doesn't know her true beauty, but I, her partner, do, it really seems like a very childish \"little boy\" way of looking at things, something men typically outgrow. \n\nAnd I was prepared to appreciate the film as an investigation into this \"stunted\" way of relating to women, and to see all the ways Daniel controlled her and used her after that through that lens, of a man that doesn't really understand what a fully constituted woman is, and sees them primarily as vehicles for their own self-fulfillment. A woman as a \"partial subject\" incomplete without a man. \n\nThat Alma finds a way to seize control, as it were, would be cool, if it wasn't so devious and dangerous. It makes her wildly unsympathetic, pretty much a villain. More and more Daniel started looking like a Jordan Peterson type, someone suspicious of women, who sees them as some serpentine manifestation of a chaos deity, and the film validates his feeling. Where I was expecting to see some growth, some denouement, some turn, there is none, this isn't the story of Daniel, it's the story of how Alma learned how to \"hack the machine\" and avoid the predictable fate of her predecessors, and get what she wants, despite Daniel. In a way, she gets to wipe off his lipstick now and see him \"how she wants\".  \n\nFor me, that is one redeeming way of looking at their dynamic, but the one thing that really saved the movie for me is its implicit humor: all of this pain and agony is ultimately in the service of hideous clothing for hideous people. It's bad art, of negligible social value to account for its interpersonal cost. It's like if we saw an intense and fraught family drama over a company that manufactures adorable panda-shaped bath mats. The disjunction between the emotional toll and the banality of the end product makes the film ultimately about pathetic subjects: two people squeezing a little bit of joy out of mutually alienating relationship.",

        "text": "This isn't really a big insight into the story's themes or an analysis of the narrative but I think this film's best moment is right at the end- Teddy's question to Chuck, \"how are we gonna get off this island\". As someone who has a close relative that suffers from bipolar this line just really hit me. The simplicity of going through this entire ordeal which is rendered completely futile by a singular line, and then that shared look between Chuck and the Doctor at the end felt uncomfortably personal and was the perfect end to the film.\n\nWhilst the film has some unrealistic and hyperbolic depictions of mental health, obviously, Scorsese managed to capture a moment of raw familarity for me. The many times you hope someone is going to heal and get better only to realise that they're still trapped in that cycle, and no matter how much you try, you cannot help them leave it. Its a tragic yet peaceful moment in the story, and one I haven't really seen come close in other films.There wasn't really any point to this post, but I felt the need to share.",

Why? I don’t know I just felt like doing it.\n\nSo I saw Secrets &amp; Lies, which I just found out won the palm do’r in the 1996 Cannes film festival, and I can’t stop thinking about this movie unless I write about it. I don’t want to exaggerate but everyone in the cast gave amazing performances, from the supporting characters to the main lead, everyone ate their cake and delivered. Even the side characters with the least screen time have their own chance in the spotlight. This has to do with Mike Leigh’s way of building its characters through improvisations while rehearsing the scenes months before shooting the actual scenes. This not only elevated the actor’s performance but also added depth on the character’s qualities. \n\nI haven’t seen other Leigh films as of now but I’m planning to see more of it because there’s so much complexity on his stories that start of very simple.\n\nI’d like to hear your thoughts on it and Mike Leigh’s style of filmmaking as well.",

        "text": "I'm interested to hear everyone's opinions of the film here. It could be anything from your thoughts of the film, to what pieces of media it reminded you of and why, or anything else in between.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's been a bit since I've seen the film and I just got around to writing up my thoughts on it now, so here's a copy of it (on Letterboxd as well):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Rating: 70/100  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So, \\*Scent of a Woman\\* was definitely an interesting movie for me. It's one that I'd never seen before and neither one that I knew anything about. I'd seen it mentioned before on the those \\*movies-you-need-to-watch-before-you-die\\* kind of lists and associated with it with the word 'classics' but had still never sat down and actually watched it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;However, recently I asked a friend of mine for a movie recommendation, one which I promised I would go in blind for. He would say a name and I would watch it straight away, without reading any descriptions or watching any trailers. It's something I plan to do more of in the future as well by the way, since it definitely added to the enjoyment I got out of the movie and didn't detract anything. Anyway, this film was his pick for me.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Initially, I wasn't too happy with how the plot and characters was playing out.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The colonel felt like he was all over the place, and we, the viewers, felt completely out of place, just like Charlie; having no idea what was going on and jumping from scene to scene along with every one of the Colonel's wishes. Even when we got the reveal at the restaurant, that the Colonel planned to commit suicide, it didn't elicit much of a reaction for me because the movie didn't give me any reason to care about him yet or tell me anything about him.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Now, I haven't looked up many other people's thought of this film or any analysis behind it from critics, so I may be entirely wrong, but that lack of sympathy might have been the point. Here's a guy tossing out a morbid and depressing plan as if it's a normal dinnertime talking point, and we the viewer, much like the rest of the people in Frank's life aren't given much reason to care enough about his mental state to rectify that. The only exception of course being Charlie.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;From there on, however, the movie takes a much more fascinating turn. We see the slightly gruff and unapproachable demeanour of his switch to something more gentle and mentor-like. The dancing scene is the best example that I could point to in order to prove that; we see him try to be a wing-man for Charlie, entertain the lady, and be courteous to her boyfriend. The sudden shift in how he behaved, before and after that scene, was one of my favourite parts of the film due to the huge contrast between them. I wasn't expecting that at all. The dancing scene was also just really fun, wholesome and light-hearted.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There was also a scene with him and Charlie, both going for a drive Ferrari, that struck me as slightly interesting, but it's been a bit since I've seen the movie so I'm not sure on all of the details. I remember Frank going from driving relatively safely to nearly outright killing the both of them. Now I'm just hazarding a guess, but maybe the reckless driving there was his way of expressing his frustration and having one more go at trying to feel alive. My reason behind that would be the fact that so far he's ticked off most of the items on his bucket list but that it probably didn't spark as much joy as he thought it would.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I didn't find the scene with his brother to be that remarkable though. I do however know why it was necessary to include it, since it served as a way to truly show how alone Frank was, that even his own family felt some degree of annoyance towards him and viewed him as merely someone to tolerate, rather than enjoy times with.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I won't mention much about the small advice sessions between the two characters throughout the movie either. It gave us a good sense of Frank's morals and showed Charlie that life has some tough decisions sometimes. Not to mention, those small scenes added up to make the final speech all that more powerful when it did come around, so I don't have any complains with them.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The final scene at Baird however, was fantastic. Right when we think that Charlie and Frank's relationship is over Frank comes out swinging for the former. It wasn't just moral support by the way, but also a complete obliteration of the questions and punishments thrown at Charlie. It was a brilliant scene to witness, and one that I thoroughly enjoyed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisagreements/agreements on the small review I wrote would be fine too.",

Obviously, older works like Dekalog, Berlin Alexanderplatz, and Scenes From a Marriage have the same artistic merits as any capital C Cinema. But the last decade or so has seen a glut of TV shows, many of which are high-concept, high-budget, and high-brow, with lots of great filmmakers turning their talents to TV. \n\nTwin Peaks: The Return is maybe the most obvious example, and has sparked many a debate about television vs cinema, but is certainly not the only high-art TV made recently. In fact, there have been so many highly lauded shows and miniseries recently that I frankly don't know where to start. \n\nBefore the pandemic, I could count all the TV shows I had seen all the way through on one hand. Now I've seen a few more, and can appreciate that TV is a very different art form; over several seasons, plots may meander with certain characters and subplots dropping out entirely. What I'm most interested in is a clear, intentional cinematic experience, which seems more common in miniseries. \n\nWhat 21st century shows (and especially miniseries) would you call cinematic, the kind of thing that could sit on a shelf next to Bergman, Kieslowski, or Fassbinder?",

        "text": "Personally, I am not too invested in the whole superhero genre. Specifically, stuff like the DCEU or MCU but there are specific superhero stories that I particularly really love like Justice League Unlimited series, Harley Quinn Animated show, The X Men Original Animated Series snd I think you could count Gargoyles as a superhero story as the Gargoyles are quite literally referred as vigilantes of the night like Batman. These are among my favorite superhero shows with Justice League Unlimited being probably my favorite along with Gargoyles. What I really loved about these 2 in particular is that they took on a very mature and important that relate to things like the risks of power (both literal and in the political, authority sense), government corruption, racism, village/collective parenthood, capitalism, public and intellectual influencers,  international conflicts, martial law, religion, etc. And they did it in a way that still captures the perfect comic book aesthetic. And the characters were also all compelling with all having independent character arcs and relationships that are prevalent throughout much of the narrative.\n\nBut how about films? Well, some of my favorite superhero movies are definitely films like The Incredibles, Spiderman 2, Story Of Ricky and also Cutie Honey. All for different reasons. \n\nWhat makes \"The Incredibles\" for me an incredible movie (pun intended) is obviously, like a lot of people say, it's the kind of film that kids cannot just enjoy for the great animation and cool action scenes but it's also is willing to explore relatable themes like family, divorce, the mediocrity of life and also, of course, genocide. We all went through it. It's fun, funny, exciting and it can have some genuinely personal moments to it. It's just simply great as a film.\n\nA lot of people say that the best one in the trilogy is the first Spiderman but personally, I really do not agree. It's  a good movie and it has its charm with a powerful and surprisingly violent climax in the fight between Spiderman and the Green Goblin but I feel \"Spiderman 2\" really embraces the spirit of what Spiderman Spiderman and Peter Parker Peter Parker. His status as a working-class hero, his relationship with his girlfriend, his studies and his problem-solving not through violent preventions of crime but through his intelligence and his willingness to help the bad guy and trying to bring them to a better direction in the lives and morality rather than just punishing them for their crimes. \"Spiderman 2\" really embraces the true meaning of what a superhero is, in my opinion and it comes with a very humble take of what the genre means. Not about superpowered world cops nor superhero just being supervillains. Just some guy doing work for the community. As clichéd as the line is, to have great power is a great responsibility and we cannot just simply kill the concept of power. Power should be held to a greater standard and be used to serve the community and help the powerless. But also, at the same time, it understands that Peter is a human just like anyone and he is also someone who has much of the experiences of being someone who was powerless and wasn't the most where his life would go and how to handle his relationship with his loved ones.\n\n\"Cutie Honey: The Movie\" is a bit of a weird one cause it's not necessarily the most traditional superhero film. It's a story about a robot superhero girl from a Manga and anime series that was appealing for its mix of magical girl/shoujo elements along with ecchi elements that are more to the appeal of boys. And what I love is that it just perfectly captures the absolute absurdity that you would find in a manga and comic book. The characters are very over-the-top and entertaining to watch and the very obvious bad cgi works to its advantage by adding to the cartoonish nature of the film. It also has a pretty homoerotic relationship between the female superhero and a woman posturing herself as hyper competent cop who is very shy in reality and they're cute to watch. The whole movie is just amusing to watch and it's quite a Hilario contrast from the rest of the stuff that Hideaki Anno has made. His works always tend to be super depressing and filled with self-loathing about the fact the fact that the creator has indulged in his emotions along with the Otaku culture he has been conflicted about. But with this film, he just completely embraces the otaku culture and just has a lot of fun with it.\n\n\"Story Of Ricky\" is a live action film adapted from a manga that I must say is, very clearly a rip off to \"Fist Of The North Star\". Big strong mothefucker who kills cartoonish evil bad guys who harm the weak in super creative ways. And the live action perfectly captures what Fist Of The North Star should be as a live action. It's goofy as hell, the gore is amazing and over-the-top and it's a big dinner of a power fantasy. This film also surprisingly comes with very explicit social commentary about the private prisons and how they abuse their prisoners with Ricky being the man to put a stop to this evil. It is one of the funnest movies I've seen in my whole life and I love it for a lot of the reasons for why I love \"Cutie Honey\", which is capturing the absurdity of comic books and has a lot of fun embracing it.\n\nTo me, the best kinds of superhero works from what I can tell are those that either fully embrace the original spirit of what something a comic and a superhero story with all its shark sprays and with its sneezes of solar systems and those who are willing to challenge themselves and tell things that can be intimate while not letting go of the importance of the superhero role.",

So I hope someone here could help me.\n\nI am writing “understand”, because I get that I am not necessarily supposed to “understand” it, I am instead supposed to “feel” it. It is after all poetry somewhat directly translated into images. But the pure symbolism leaves me cold, because, I guess, I don’t know what to do with it. The imagery (not the Christian-themed style, but the essence of the imagery) seems so alien to me, that it hinders itself from communicating the poetry of Sayat Nova to me. I have actually read some of his poetry out of interest from this film, and I get so much more out of it, because I understand the linguistic imagery and symbolism he uses.\n\nAs a comparison, Mirror, an on the surface seemingly vague film due to its poetic images, is probably my favorite film of all time. It specifically to me on an almost transcendental level, which I neither understand or can explain. But I guess it’s because of its familiar images, that makes me love this film and not Parajanov’s. At least here, I am able to comprehend the images presented to me.\n\nSo what am I missing? How am I supposed to “understand” the images when I don’t know the context of the poet’s life or the world being presented? I can already hear the people saying, “maybe it’s just not for you”, which is understandable. Art hits different people differently. So maybe, my real question is, how does it justify its existence as a film? Why try and translate a poet’s words into visual images? What is the purpose of this film? And so on. Maybe I’m rambling. I hope you get at least a sense of what I’m asking. I’m sorry if I offended any fans of it, I am just truly confused.",

It sort of slips into a twilight zone for a second.\n\nI'd like to know some other films/shows that do this. And what do you think makes a good \"Did I just see that\"/twilight zone moment? What are the essential elements?",

        "text": "To preface, this is a bit of a spontaneous emotional post. I will completely admit that I am biased.\n\nIn my experience, test screenings and reshoots/recuts because of the audience have made films worse. Every time. I can think of dozens of examples where this seems to be the case. For example, \"Avatar 2\"s major plotholes are because of cut scenes due to test screenings. \"Blade Runner\"s poignant and beautifully ambiguous ending was butchered and now they've in fact reverted back to Scott's original vision. Don't get me started on how \"I am Legend\" was reduced to a casual zombie action flick instead of the originally intended deeply metaphorical and philosophical examination of predatory and prey. And of course, don't forget about the \"Suicide Squad\" debacle. \n\nI saw Danny Boyle's \"Steve Jobs\" the other day and Sorkin writes this brilliant line about art.   \n\"They don't get a vote. When Dylan wrote \"Shelter from the Storm\" he didn't ask people to contribute to the lyrics. Plays don't stop so the playwright can ask the audience what scene they'd like to see next.\" I couldn't agree more. Audiences don't know what they want. Why do they get a vote? Why can't don't we just leave it up to the filmmakers who spent their entire lives mastering their craft and years bringing a passionate vision to life? Why do these studios and filmmakers give audiences (who've literally only invested an hour and a half) any say in how the film is made? \n\nI suppose the obvious answer is that the films need to appeal to focus groups and target audiences in order to see the light of day. It is, after all, a business. Alas.\n\nI would love to hear some more examples of how test screenings have ruined films. Despite my emotional state right now, I would also love to hear examples of how test screenings have improved films too. What are you fellows' thoughts on them? Am I being too harsh?",

World War 2 is unique because I don't think there's ever been a war as black or white as this one, with clear \"good guys\" and \"bad guys\"; the Nazis and the Axis of Evil couldn't be more villainous if they tried with mass executions, fascist ideologies, genocide, horrific scientific experimentation (Dr. Mengele &amp; Unit 731) rape &amp; pillaging, etc. history is always very complicated &amp; nuanced, but WW2 is as clear-cut as it gets in real life conflict when it comes to who's in the right and who's in the wrong and why the opposition needs to be stopped. it's perfect for storytelling in cinema.\n\nWW1 is a bit different.

        "text": "Last night I saw mubi had a double feature of Ripstein's Castle of purity and Lanthimos dogtooth so I decided to watch them back to back. Before this I was not aware of Dogtooth ( but I had seen and enjoyed The Lobster ) but I had seen bits and pieces of Castle of Purity. \n\nI am not terribly interested in getting in an argument about whether there was unattributed inspiration or whether Lanthimos owed anything to Ripstein, I have made up my mind about this but arguing either way feels like getting in a pointless debate of which there seems to be a few online already. \n\nWhat I'm interested in talking about is in comparing the movies for what they tried to achieve and what did they manage to accomplish. I enjoyed both movies for what they were but I think I would have had a different impression had I not watch them one after the other. \n\nTo start, I think while the premise and some of the ideas and themse are **very** similar, the obvious difference ( narrative-wise ) is the shift in focus between the films. While Castle of Purity feels almost like a horror movie where Ripstein ( and José Emilio Pacheco ) go out of their way to flesh out Gabriel ( the father of the family ) and his way of thinking and violently manipulating his family in contrast to his behaviour with the outside world, Dogtooth is more focused on the children of the family and the effect their isolation and upbringing has had on them. \n\nIn my reading, Lanthimos is more trying to comment on (abusive, over-) sheltering than to present particular unique characters, it provides very little motivation for why things are the way that they are and just shows us the messed up ways in which the parents of this family try to keep the status quo they have built for themselves. The filmmaking, whatever that is, is appropriate for this as it is sober, and bright and deadpan yet it keeps horrifying you ( reminded me in a way to Midsummer ). The openness of the ending I feel is an indication that Lanthimos wanted the public to reflect on the consequences of this overbearing sheltering, is she dead? would it be better if she was dead?, etc. \n\nCastle of Purity on the other hand seems completely attached to the real life case that it is based on. It takes its time to fleash out Gabriel as a character, his motivations and the way he ended up there. It shows the interactions he had with each member of his family and his views on society, sex, gender, etc. You see the way he manipulates his wife, how the children's attitude change as he becomes more violent, and as I said before the interactions Gabriel has with the outside world which completely contrast with the nonsense he feeds his family. It is horrifying and dreadful, it keeps you tense for the whole thing and when &gt;!Utopia finally sends her note and it just gets stepped on!&lt; it just breaks your heart. It's gritty and claustrophobic and it is filmed in a way that keeps you on edge ( it reminded me of Hereditary, a little bit less, maybe I'm just forcing the analgoy ). \n\nI think the intentions of both movies are somewhat different even with the **very** similar premise and ideas, where Dogtooth deals with this more abstract concept of sheltering and upbringing through this slate of a family with unnamed family memebers. Castle of purity in contrast is more concrete and dated with ideas of abuse, masculinity and resistence to progress through the portrayal of fleshed out characters who like in the real-case version of themselves bear names like Utopia and Porvenir. \n\nAll in all I enjoyed Castle of Purity more, but again maybe I would think different had I watch them at different times. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

I loved it then, still love it now that I have it on Criterion.\n\nIt's interesting, the translation differences.  I didn't even think about that being a factor until I started the rewatch.  In my copy twenty years ago, Keung makes what I thought was a knowing acknowledgement asking if Chan's masseuse is a \"pig.\"  In the Criterion he just asks if she's pretty.  There's also little jokes turned around.  When Lau talks to his fiancée about her novel character having 28 personalities, he said it was her mother in the original translation I had, here he self-deprecatingly says it's him.  \n\nOverall, I find Lau a kind of sympathetic character.  To be honest, I kind of rooted for him to get away with it.  I didn't necessarily root for Chan's character to die, but certainly afterwards I did feel bad for Lau.  At least in my original memory, in my original translation, he kind of came across as having a genuine change of character.  Although during my current rewatch, I could see him being a bit more selfish in also wanting to make sure there's no ties between Boss Sam, his old life, and his current one.\n\nWhile I'm not that familiar with the Hong Kong film industry, this apparently really revitalized it around the turn of the millennium, and became a world cinema sensation.",

        "text": "I love films that are deeply psychological and reveal how complicated human being are. What films do you think excel at getting to the psychological depths of its characters? For Me:\n\nI believe David Lynch is truly the master at creating these types of films. SPOILERS AHEAD: Nearly every Lynch film examines the inner obsessions, desire, guilts and fears of its characters. Blue Velvet brilliantly examines psychosexual perversity. I could write a whole post analyzing the psychology of Blue Velvet by looking at how Frank and Dorothy become parent figures for Jeffrey discovering his dark side. Mulholland Drive and Lost Highway are fascinating in how they show their protagonists' projecting ideal versions of themselves while denying their reality and Twin Peaks Fire Walk With Me is a devastatingly real observation on how abuse and trauma becomes a cycle as well as how sexual promiscuity and drug abuse are used to numb emotional pain and gain control.\n\nHitchcock is know for being brilliant at making psychological films but for me most of his movies are pretty simple in their psychology (like psycho and spellbound). However, he achieved a true psychological masterpiece with Vertigo. It's a movie that examines the image and idea that we create in an ideal partner and how no one can ever live up that fantasy. I think it was Ebert who said \"it's about trying to force life to make us happy\" and how how it effects us when that inevitably fails. \n\nScorsese made two masterpieces in this area in my opinion and they are obvious ones: Taxi Driver and Raging Bull. Both of these movies are fascinating in their portrayal of the \"Madonna/Whore syndrome\" as well as toxic masculinity. Taxi Driver is incredibly ahead of its time as it predates mass shooters and \"incels\" and how loneliness can drive a person insane and Raging Bull examines the animal nature of Jake Lamotta and his lack of control over emotions. \n\nThe last one I want to mention is Paul Thomas Anderson's The Master which delves into cults, the traits of a cult leader, and the vulnerability of the people who get roped in. It also highlights a psychological treatment that has some good aspects but also has no scientific data behind, just the power of its leader's personality.",

        "text": "I probably should start by saying this is one of my favourites films ever, Charlie Kaufman is a genius and Michel Gondry did a fantastic job directing (apparently there's a good commentary track but I haven't listened to it yet unfortunetly). Not to mention the spectacular acting. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet worked so well together here.\n\nWhen I first watched it all those years ago I was intrigued by it almost immediately. It's so strange with a pinch of eeriness although I didn't know why. \n\nI'll say I'm quite a masculine man I don't cry easy at films, but every time I see this film oh dear god it's such a gut punch. Getting hurt in a relationship sure isn't easy but imagine if you forgot all the good times as well. It'd be awful; Horrific even.\n\nWhich I guess leads to my next point, this is maybe the scariest film I have ever seen, because it plays out in Joel's subconscious and it's constantly distorted and changing around him. Elijah Wood as Patrick \"Baby Boy\" is brilliant and somewhat unnerving, imagine how much of a scumbag you'd have to be to do what he tries.\n\nBit by bit as Joel accepts that he is running from the inevitable (despite his efforts) is awful. That scene at the beach house where he says that he wishes he done a lot differently gets me everytime.\n\nAt least it ends on a hopeful note that maybe it can work, and if it doesn't then okay.",

It is supposed to feel like nightmare from childhood and awake some of our deep and long forgotten fears. Also there are so public domain Fleischer cartoons from 30s playing on old TV, which is relatable as hell for me. \n\nSo what would you say. And no, I did not found out about this film on TikTok.",

Everything feels so aimless, the themes feel so underdeveloped, and I broadly feel like I'm watching a movie that is always on the cusp of working in some form if certain things were adjusted, but there's just too many aspects out of sync.\n\nA lot of people are always writing about how deep his films are and all these amazing things they take away from his work and I just don't understand any part of it, which is something rare for me. Even with films I don't enjoy, typically I can at least see something they're angling at, but with Hong I feel like I'm seeing entirely different films from his fans. \n\nAre there people out there who know what I'm talking about or am I just a philistine?",

        "text": "Lets be real: Ghostbusters 2016, Velma, High Guardian Spice... those are all examples of very poorly written shows. Unlikable characters, bad plot, bad special effects or animation, mischaracterization of pre-existing characters in Velma's case.     \n\nBut when I look at the discourse regarding these movies online, the monumental criticism is not pointed towards the bad writing of the show. No, a lot of the time it tends to be pointed towards the diversity of the show, and how it is forcing a political agenda because of it. And I feel like the problem with this is that it drowns out all of the genuine criticism being aimed at the show's writing, making it seem like the diversity is the sole flaw, or even the reason why it sucks at all.        \n\nBut I feel like an even bigger problem with this kind of mindset that people on the internet have is that it creates the idea that any diverse media has to be *perfect* for it to not get this kind of criticism. For example, people thought Into The Spiderverse was going to be pandering until it turned out that the movie was actually very good. Essentially, the movie has to be very good for the diversity to be justified. But the thing is, mediocre movies exist, and as more and more movies become diverse, there are going to be mediocre diverse movies. It non-diverse mediocre movies can be allowed to just exist and fade away into obscurity, then diverse mediocre movies should be allowed to do the same without everyone and their mothers preaching how that particular movie is going to be the fall of western civilization, or something. \n\nWatch, The Little Mermaid remake is going to suck, like pretty much all Disney live-action remakes do, and people are going to be blaming the poor reception on the film solely on the fact that Halle Bailey played Ariel, and not on the fact that it was yet another cash-grabbing remake.",
