The Angles, Saxons and Jutes are supposed to have originally occupied the Jutland Peninsula right across from Scandinavia. As for the broader genetic group of Germans, which would come to include the Franks and Suevi as well, Wikipedia says:\n\n&gt;Archaeological and linguistic evidence from a period known as the Nordic Bronze Age indicates that **a common material culture existed between the Germanic tribes that inherited the southern regions of Scandinavia**, along with the Schleswig-Holstein area and the area of what is now Hamburg, Germany. ... Exactly how these cultures interacted remains a mystery but the migrations of early proto-Germanic peoples are discernible from the remaining evidence of prehistoric cultures in HÃ¼gelgrÃ¤ber, Urnfield, and La Tene. Climatic change between 850 BCE to 760 BCE in Scandinavia and \"a later and more rapid one around 650 BCE might have triggered migrations to the coast of Eastern Germany and further toward the Vistula.\n\nThat would suggest Vikings and Teutons are of the same stock, unless I'm misreading.

Modern humans are descendants of a chimp like ancestor. Then we also had cousins from the early common ancestor (chimps) that branched off into homo genus, orrorins etc... All are also in Africa. When the humans evolved to match the modern us, they moved out from Africa. However, they were not the first one...\n\nThen, we encountered Neanderthals in Europe. Europeans must've had more Neanderthal in them because they probably co-mingled until the Neans died out? \n\nThe humans who also ventured East met others, like Denisovans or Homo Erectus? They the lower ones except Modern humans died out because their tools are not that great and they did not adapt.\n\nSo basically. We're not descendants of Neanderthals or Erectus, they are a separate species, but are in the same tree just not our common ancestor \"chimpanzee tree\". They're probably a cousin of our ancestor chimp, like the gorilla cousin? But in the trunk of it all, we, the neans, erectus and the others are all descendants of the monkey... Tree..? We did breed with Neanderthals so we're probably 0.1% of them? Or is this mostly Europeans...?\n\nThe first monkeys that evolved in Africa, stayed in Africa. Then many hundreds and thousands and millions of years, they evolved and then separated, and those separations became super diverse and then somehow Humans emerged from... Africa?? Or Asia...??\n\nI am confused.",

        "text": "Heyo guys, I'm planning up a novel set within the Mesolithic Period in a hunter-gatherer society. Some info before I start with questions might make this a tad easier, haha.\nCountry/location is vaguely Canada, with Australian bush and/or food/use of tools mentioned. It isn't based off any real country or area, so plant/animal life is flexible and the specific behaviours of the people. However, the environment is/will be taken in account for, looking at how other hunter-gatherer people were influenced by environment and temperature. The place, however, is a fantasy setting. There are multiple tribes that interact with each other, and they are located around a large lake (Likely based off Reindeer Lake in Canada for size and fauna), with a nomadic structure. They spend parts of the year by the lake, up/down stream and in-bush due to hunting/gathering needs and spiritual beliefs. Tribes have a complicated belief system based on animism, and the spirits that reside within places, people, animals and flora. \n\nStory starts with a female protagonist being left on one of the small lake islands (Just a bit of land rising out of the ocean, so nothing survivable on it) after being excommunicated from her clan. A disease has hit her people, and she was the first one who caught it, and so far the only survivor. Believing her to be the cause, they've declared her clanless (a huge thing, because not only are you cut off from all that you know, but your survival relies on your community, with resources being pulled together. Without that collective knowledge and resources, you've got buckleys at surviving for more than a year or so, and likely worse for wear with the sudden no human contact thing. Is this a realistically terrible thing? I know in agricultural times this would of been a huger deal, with cut off from trading, but even in this period would it of been a major punishment?) and left her to die there so her spirit will be given to the lake. She ends making a pack with a hungry spirit, gets saved by another girl from neighbouring tribe (who is also being afflicted by this mystery illness) and they set out up lake and river to find the cause after clues start coming together that this might not be an illness at all, but a poison. Also, gay shit happens. This is a fantasy novel, but I want it grounded in reality. That means I'm definitely interested in how these people lived, the types of food, what their shelters might look like, how their cultures would of developed and etc. Basically, I want it to feel real even with the fantasy elements. \n\nAfter that massive word vomit, here are some questions! :P\n\n1. The spiritual beliefs (which are confirmed for the most part to be true, because fantasy) are grounded in the practice of animism. Would people in this period have complicated belief systems, taught orally, or would it be more simplistic? I know nothing can be confirmed for sure, but thoughts?\n\n2. Is this basic premise, ie, the setting and the way the clans set up realistic? \n\n3. How often would nomadic tribes move? Particular reasons of movement, or common length of staying in one camp? So far these people stay in the one camp for at least a few months, depending on the location. They basically rotate between certain areas depending on seasonal stuff. Also, differing clans also do slightly differing things due to their traditions.\n\n4. Food! How complex was their cooking mechanisms? What did they cook with? This is set on a lake, with a specific lake for fauna, so what would they eat out of the lake? How many fish species? Do they discriminate between species, and should I just look at game fish? Or are there more than that?\n\n5. Understanding of diseases. What was super early human understanding of poison and diseases? They would know of course that hey, leaving the dead lying around leads to disease and that certain plants should not be eaten. Would it be feasible to then conclude that they would understand deliberate attempts at poisoning?\n\n7. What kind of hierarchies and how were communities structured? I know, I apologise for the miss-mash of different people, but with the huge lack of knowledge on what these people actually did I'm just going with any and all information and using that to shape the people I'm creating, so any examples and ideas you can give would be great.\n\n8. Any misconceptions, or things to look out for? Things that I definitely should or should not include?\n\n9. What kind of weaponry did they have, exactly? Bows and arrows? Spears? I understand that they had stone axes, likely fire hardened spears, but what further tools should I look at? Would bone tools be common?\n\n10. Differing early societies had different practices and what they thought of was okay and not okay in regards to sexuality, so what would of early humans been like? If numbers are low, that might pressure for more heterosexual couplings, however it can be seen that a lot of ancient societies were sort of okay with homosexuality, and even certain early medieval people. Thoughts on that, how it should be handled? Obviously, this might come down to story decision, but what are your thoughts?\n\n12. How did early humans deal with the menstruals? Or even the people nowadays without access to things like pads and tampons? :0\n\n11. Recs for further reading! Probably things that can be sort of easily understood, and focused on the lives of these people. Honestly, any info you can give me on how these people lived would be great.\n\nSeriously, thank y'all for giving me your time and hope y'all have a lovely christmas period. :) ",

I can only imagine I'll get this question with greater frequency when I tell people I'm going to dedicate 5-8 years of my life studying this in grad school and, hopefully, the rest of my life being an anthropological researcher as  a career.                                                                                 \n                                                                      \nWhile I'm aware that once I get to the PhD level I will have a much more specific \"thing\" I'm working on within anthropology that I may be able to explain, how do you explain anthropology as a field?                 \n                                                                \nI always say: Anthropology is the attempt to understand humans holistically, though usually broken up into the studies of biology, language, culture and archeology. Sometimes I provide specific examples of what is studied within biology, linguistics, culture and archeology but I still get confused looks... any advice on how to explain anthropology?",

        "text": "So I asked over in r/IndianCountry, and they said this question would be better served here. Though I live near the CDA Tribe, I am not comfortable picking up the phone and calling them without more information, though, and I thought maybe Reddit would be able to tell me more/what to do/what not to do.\n\nThere is a land spirit near my home, and I want to take good care of him. But I don't know what he is, not properly, and while I can guess at how to be a good neighbor too him, I'm not sure. What I presently think I know: This land spirit is enormous and occupies at least 15 acres and maybe more like 30. By occupies, I mean the earth is his flesh, the trees his fur. He's very young. He likes humans and dogs. He seems to like being full of precious metals (this area has a tremendous quantity of minerals), and he even seems to find the mines near his acreage interesting. He's not angry or malicious. He's most active in the summer, and falls asleep for at least a little while in the winter.\n\nA family friend once refereed to such a thing as a Moulee Moulee, but that appears to be wrong (it is french for 'cast', what would a cast-cast be?) I've tried to find stories that talk about gargantuan earth spirits, but I haven't found anything that seems to fit.\n\nWhat might this be, and who should I contact to learn more?",
