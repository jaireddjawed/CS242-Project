Ussop literally fights Luffy over this and she saves their lives 1 more time before dying at Enis Lobby.\n\nAnd The 1000 Sunny has bailed them out of a ton of threats. Without her, they'd all be dead and gone. \n\nTo rectify this, I am posting this thread.",

        "text": "As strange as this may sound, I’ve always found Koby’s transformation between Romance Dawn and Enies Lobby the hardest part of One Piece to suspend my disbelief (Pell’s survival included). \n\nThere’s only a few months between the events and the physical growth just doesn’t make sense (I know it’s manga/anime), but also the rapid increase in strength and abilities is proportionally more than anyone else we’ve seen. I know he’s not stronger than Luffy, but I think he’s had a greater increase in strength compared to their starting point in Romance Dawn. Given Luffy has gone through Alabasta, Skypiea and Enies Lobby during this time, it seems hard to believe than Garp’s training would be more intense than this. \n\nThe other thing is that Oda has written numerous details that appear to be throwaway details, only to be paid off 600 chapters or so later (most of Skypiea being a prime example). We saw Momo undergo a similar transformation but there’s a legitimate explanation due to Shinobu’s powers. \n\nMy question is, do you think there’s a more significant explanation to Koby’s development than watching Garp’s ab tutorials on YouTube, and what that explanation might be? Or is his development more akin to the silhouette development of the female straw hat pirates?",

That drake is missing this is now a mystery and it’s not just going to be like he shows up and that’s it no big deal,\n\nnow I believe drake is connected to vegapunk.\n\nhe was able to figure out the kuma he fought was a px  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wfzi7xlb5aka1.jpg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=21f532e7e82df3bd634e5b10e721a428572acfb4\n\n not just that but look at the wording.  “ you recreated kizaru‘s attack power, vegapunk!”\n\nhe doesn’t call him dr vegapunk or the old man which implies either respect or interpersonal connections he calls him by his name which implies personal relationship and this is helped by his wording of “ you “.  He doesn't say “ so doctor vegapunk created tne pacifista finally “. He says “ you “. meaning in his head he’s visualising vegapunk in front of him and talking directly to that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe also made a comment about them having red blood implying he knows about greenblood.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9p6xiv99j8ka1.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=20441a7646f7f723025fb09d4f160ed8dab1cad8\n\nIn the new world he went to a island only known as kaido’s favourite island.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h900pxqb6aka1.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=57cec0c84a337e971941963e3be9591091bd3c07\n\nlook closely,  the island is made of metal literally everything is metal.\n\nbut more than that in a anime only scene he comes across a dome that opens up revealing a city \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mp39afyk6aka1.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7ed8bba160ddf7647a5f7b2c6ea421f3deb8c081\n\nand if you ask me that looks familiar.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/38ew0dfo6aka1.jpg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=35f473f49562844472d1389f524c2bbdd301b386\n\ncould vp be connected to this island ?\n\nAnyway in the volume 104 sbs oda went on to detail drakes personal hobbies.\n\ndrake has a interest in herpetology which is the study of reptiles which makes sense as he is a dinosaur and he is into astrophysics which is the study of celestial objects.\n\nHe also in wano fought sanji and revealed he is a fan of the sora comics that based off of sanji family \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vygwaw6p7aka1.jpg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c3d32af2b437bc2dc80d912383aeea195255f506\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dna5hu6p7aka1.jpg?width=875&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6eeb1e800c6c2f449118227d737f007cf1be146e\n\nwhy is this relevant?  Because the name of the character and the name of sanji mother is sora which means sky and in Ancient Greek celestial meant sky.  vegapunk has 6 satellites and the main body is Stella which means celestial star.\n\nwe also meet a goresei who’s name is revealed to be Saturn a celestial body and a celestial dragon.\n\nso ask yourself why is oda telling us drake is into science and all things celestial related ?\n\nnow how is he here ?\n\nwell I have 2 theories\n\n1.  caribou for his own reasons kidnapped drake either for revenge or he found out about sword and wants to capture him.    \n\ncaribou also ended up on kaido‘s favourite island and was captured by drake after he beat up scotch the cyborg guard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/069hxri59aka1.jpg?width=474&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7bdf11ad8dec7abf437693b98da2537feaf3d25c\n\n[They both have x on their chests ](https://preview.redd.it/4rhvwri59aka1.jpg?width=474&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4cc8fb3b92edc189688262242ce8dd4a65deeaf5)\n\nso I could see caribou getting the drop on drake Who was injured and distracted.\n\nor \n\ndrake was heading to marine base G14 to meet up with sword and was either passing through egghead or was going to visit vegapunk first but he was attacked by the shark and eaten then brought in and thrown into the same cell block as vegapunk and cipher pole so the next time we return to stella we will see drake.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3x87svrv9aka1.png?width=1620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a68fafef6ffe66337db90b5b8c2349dda57043e4",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/11bdbh0/parallels_in_one_piece/",
        "text": "So we know oda has created several parallels between the old gen and new generation. Several dynamics between characters and particular characters are paralleled to characters in the new generation. And as one would expect the most prominent parallels usually involve luffy to roger.\n\nSome people pick out characters or dynamics that are not parallels but these are some of the worst forced parallels i've seen:\n\n# 1. Worst parallels \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k141gwetp9ka1.jpg?width=377&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3f73fa441b94e0b2f9f47b348ff90d55410cd062\n\nLaw and WB is one of the worst parallels that the community have tried to force, these 2 are nothing alike anyway, completely different personalities and roles. The only thing connecting these 2 are that they are strong, they are pirates and they are df users. And these lists are probably the longest lists in the story in terms of the sheer size of characters they contain. If i wrote out every strong pirate with a df i would have more than 150 characters.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q8anyqgdq9ka1.jpg?width=772&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a5a42524e384e695d0d70109e8637bc273c130e2\n\nThis one has a similar problem to the Law/Wb one, these 2 are almost nothing alike. The only similarities are strong, pirates, dfs and overall negative morals. And that is another quota that contains so many damn characters. \n\nEssentially for parallels to exist there has to be very specific quotas that can only fit one or 2 characters max\n\n# 2. Very Clear Parallels Established\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t2vqd2ujn9ka1.jpg?width=1072&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7d437b2bfd7e582151ab3c3783e1aed667a66f57\n\nSo this one is pretty obvious, yamato has inherited the will of oden and will likely accompany luffy on his final journey to laughtale. Both oden and yamato restricted their entire lives and wanted to live freely and go on adventures. Luffy and Roger are pretty obvious so won't elaborate too much on that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uy216r1mn9ka1.jpg?width=1042&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b832b7ccbd895ab2b254673bce83938b6b23cc18\n\nTom built the oro jackson for roger, the ship that would one day become the ship of the pirate king. Toms apprentice Franky built a ship for luffy( rogers successor) Thousand Sunny that would one day become the ship of the pirate king. Both ships made of the legendary adam wood. Iceberg could also take this role but franky just fits more\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s14g2jinn9ka1.jpg?width=1054&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2fce73c3ba16bc952913142be8aa0c3580a44b24\n\nRocks and BB both known to be evil Ds who wanted to bring chaos to the world. Both have a caribbean theme to their designs and their bases are located on hachinosu(pirate island), Bbs ship is named the saber of xebec, and rocks ship looks strikingly similar to the real world Blackbeards anne marie ship. 2 greatest pirates of the old gen rocks and roger, 2 greatest pirates of the new gen Luffy and BB. The 2 sides to the D. Both BB and Rocks gathered the best of the best sacrificing chemistry for quality.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/083v75yon9ka1.jpg?width=995&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2cff21521d82bec15778733a4ab2b20f83d9d81a\n\nWb and Roger were friendly rivals, roger being alot smaller in size. Wb cares about family the most and makes anyone who touches his family pay. Wb was formerly a member of rocks crew but eventually became a captain after his captains fall, his crew is comprised of his sons. Luffy and Kat are friendly rivals, luffy being alot smaller. Kat cares abut family nearly as much as Wb and makes anyone who touches his family pay. He is a current member of the big mom pirates and Some headcanon but makes alot of sense given the crews instability:\n\nWb turned against rocks, seeing his true nature and allied with roger. Future crew comprised of sons who he looks after\n\nKat will turn against big mom, seeing her true nature and will ally with luffy. Future crew comprised of younger siblings who he looks after\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cf9fctbrn9ka1.jpg?width=1062&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=adfac26fb370fe59f15875742ad4bd87ab9b8bdc\n\nFuture pirate King(ROGER) splits the skys with Worlds Strongest man(WHITEBEARD) . Future pirate king(LUFFY) splits skys with World Strongest Creature(KAIDOU).\n\nThe reaction of Yamato and Oden is also a parallel as they witnessed these events\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1thh4igsn9ka1.jpg?width=995&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2d616c7168a9d12003531084e67eb988138dbec2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/68ulc6bao9ka1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=aea022ab042a1bed4ff7846e4227c1f19c6aff6a\n\nToki and Oden paralels with Zoro and Hiyori. Oden saved Tokis life then she restored his health, Zoro saved Hiyoris life then she restored zoros health. The powerful feroicious samurai contrasted by the gentle and weak woman. Hiyori and Toki despite being weak are both incredibly headstrong and stand resolute in their beliefs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWings of the Pirate King. The 2 men who support the Pirate King in combat. Rayleigh current Pirate Kings right hand, Zoro Future Pirate Kings right hand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1u0yzb16n9ka1.jpg?width=1050&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=64c368ada933fe9a7da432216312b7bf28270ba3\n\nPirate and Marine ally in God valley to take down Rocks. Pirate and Marine ally in Punk Hazard take down Ceaser and Vergo. G-5 and the strawhats teamed up to take them down led by luffy and smoker. G-5 and Roger pirates teamed up to take down Rocks led by Garp and Roger. Garp was chasing Roger all over the place and Smoker was chasing Luffy all over the place.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g0mirtnjt9ka1.jpg?width=1036&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=325f209ead22196c5140a66d16a57ce672807f9c\n\nLuffy and Roger are pretty obvious. Both Pirate Kings, Will of D, same Dream, same will and view on freedom and conquering.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mnitv9ytt9ka1.jpg?width=1037&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c9e33bffec72139abca14570f3aa5b1caee58633\n\nLuffy and Garp is another obvious one. Botn Monkey D. very similar characteristics, both not bright, reckless incredibly headstrong, brawlers who rely on their fists, obsession with meat on a stiick. Both incredible talent for heroism.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a1dxdkrzu9ka1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=395a9859a563599c43e7b8438f14dc862433eca6\n\nThis one kind of speaks for itself, Drake was also taken under the wing of sengoku.\n\n# 2. Unclear Parallels that are not established Yet\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese are dynamics that almost certainly have predecessors in the old gen due the level importance these characters have in the narrative. But Oda hasn't revealed them yet.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2boe75ltn9ka1.jpg?width=1025&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=20d29adfd077d0f24d36089f839a4d88d8f85771\n\nShanks and Luffy. Luffy received the strawhat from the man he admired shanks. Shanks was a pirate who had travelled all around the world and was incredibly powerful while luffy at the time was weak and had never left goa before. We know roger had this same hat in jis youth, and as one would expect roger must also have people he looks up to and the man who gave him that hat is his shanks. Shanks will have several similarities to this character once revealed in rogers origin, this man may have sacrificed a body part to save roger when he was a kid.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yfji5ig4n9ka1.jpg?width=1006&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8dd81ad29ff4cb439e2ee7e162bba40f8979f8dc\n\nAce and Luffy, 2 brothers and 2 Ds who grew up in the gray terminal together. I believe Garp is one of the old gen pair who parallel this brother tandem, and very likely the younger brother like luffy was, since we know luffy and garp looked nearly identical as kids. Garps older brother will bare several similarities to Ace. ***Cool personality, maybe flames*** will ***possess the will of D***. Only decent candidate i can think of is Rocks being the older brother of Garp.\n\nAce and Luffy are also a duo of hat wearers, they both have distinct hats that are staples of their design almost always seen with them. We know luffy received this hat at 7 years old and ace received this hat between the ages of 10 and 17. Meaning that whoever gave the hat to ace is a parallel to shanks. And whoever gave the hat to that person is a parallel to roger.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/onuxnvrrr9ka1.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b263823bf278386ef0fefba22aa83353bb9df1b8\n\nPersonally my headcanon is that Ace received the hat from rocks apprentice, contrasted with luffy who received the hat from rogers apprentice. And that apprentice was whitey bay\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/td0tbte8n9ka1.jpg?width=1018&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=289fa4076228d84963e195da0b1b7e9a46182174\n\nLaw and Luffy, a duo of Ds, one ***very reckless and stupid single minded, stubborn but also pure hearted***, the other cunning and intelligent. Luffy a pirate who has incredible talent for heroism, Law a pirate who has incredible talent for surgery/medicine, swordsman. I first run to Garp as the one of the old gen pair who represents luffy, so Garp might have a former nakama in the marines who was a ***will of D like law, a swordsman and a surgeon/doctor, cunning intelligent.*** Funny enough Garp witnessed the death of rouge during her childbirth, he couldn't do anything to help her given that he isn't a doctor, but i've made a theory before that rouges father is a will of D who was a surgeon. so this guy could potentially be the parallel for law who we don't have yet.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tmo9o71ym9ka1.png?width=1230&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2e95cd355166644ae479949ed94d6ecd9e8c99f9\n\nLaw and Koby could also be substituted here. Koby a hero, Law a doctor/surgeon. The Rocky Port Duo. A predecessor duo of a hero and a swordsman/surgeon who were known for teaming up to end big conflicts. This hero could have similarities to Koby that Garp might not have. Koby sees the flaws in the navy and addresses them publicly he has natural observational prowess which garp doesn't have.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aarlssv1n9ka1.jpg?width=1003&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f3ac544136331152f5a9fece02e3e637122a3a6a\n\nJust as the 3 greatest pirates before luffy gained ships, Luffy also gained his own ship in the sunny go So we should certainly expect the same for apprentices, The 3 great pirates eventually had kids join their crew as apprentices, luffy will eventually gain his own apprentices.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vqbfmfa0n9ka1.jpg?width=1062&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e8ec490b22b64ba72d9b2b5cacee3ce0b2ddaeb1\n\nJust as the 3 greatest pirates before luffy had babies born on their ships. Luffy will likely have babies born on his crew. All kids of big mom between the ages of 38 and 48 were born on rocks ship. The image shows a baby cracker who would have been born in this time frame as he is 45 years old so he would have been born on the crew 1 year before Kaidou joined the crew. We know roger found shanks as a baby in a treasure chest.\n\nAs for this baby or babies that will be born on luffys crew, i believe these are the hypothetical apprentices aswell. They are both the apprentices/baby parallel.",

And be all means, it seems to be as so far, no emperor has conquered Elbaf.\n\nEven Big Mom could not conquer Elbaf, but rather hoped to gain its alliance via a marriage between Loki and Lola.\n\nThis means that there have to be yonko tier giants in elbaf. I believe these giants live at the top of the tree, like the gods atop Yggdrasil in norse mythology. These giants are likely far stronger than the ones young Linlin defeated in her flashback. Strong enough to keep any yonko or the WG from claiming elbaf as part of their territory.\n\nIt makes sense for giants to be this strong, as not only are they immensely large, they can live for hundreds of years. This means that giants would have centuries to master abilities such as haki or awaken devil fruits.\n\nI think the top of the elbaf tree would be a good location for the 4th Road Poneglyph. By placing it there, Whitebeard would ensure that the only person who could claim it would be one capable of surpassing Roger.",

Mid in the sense that they weren't the worst, but they by no means were the best.\n\nLikewise, one of my favorites is Skypeia, but I know it has only more recently become higher on the list due to lore reveals.\n\nSo, what kinds of things do you all think about? I usually think about what helps build the world out more (hence the pirate-y adventure of Skypeia being pretty dope), as well as arcs that don't take too long (I'm looking at you, Dressrosa).\n\nAlso, feel free to convince me that Alabasta and Dressrosa are peak.

        "text": "I really liked the arc as a whole despite what some fans call “flaws” throughout the arc. The one BIGGEST regret was the negligence in the tying up of plot threads towards the end of the arc.\n\nShimotsuki Plotline - Really wanted to see this expanded upon in this arc with Oda using Ushimaru as a means to do that.\n\nYamato - She quite clearly needed more time as a character to grow in the arc and the Onigashima battle wasn’t really the best time for that.\n\nMore attention to minor characters - lots of characters like the scabbards, hiyori and the numbers should’ve received more time and attention than they got as the scabbards got neglected, hiyori got attention but she needed more expansion and that coincided with Oda’s deadline for completing Wano.\n\n\nAll in all, it’s really regretful that Film RED lead to Wano having bumps as it approached it’s conclusion. Personally, it was really a great arc to read on a weekly basis.",

        "text": "I was just high and thinking about it, everyone says that Luffy got his power up to joy boy because death awakened his devil fruit. In way yes that is true but here is what I think really happened. \n\nSince zoan fruits have a mind of their own and we know that the user needs to basically “share the will” of the devil fruit in body and mind to awaken it. \n\nSo here is what I think. Luffy embodies freedom, he will fight for the people he believes to be oppressed as long as they are willing to stand up and ask for help. Nika is also the symbol of freedom. And we know nika and joyboy are one and the same. We know that joyboy failed to free the world otherwise the world gov wouldnt be in control. He fought for freedom until he died… \n\nAs you might surmise, my theory is luffy had to die in the pursuit of others freedom to unlock the awakening. And only my doing so does the devil fruit truly align with his will. \n\nThat is the end of the theory but I just thought of this which is a little more out there. Since it was said that devil fruits are born of desires what if the awakening and revival of luffy was joyboys own desire of coming back to life so he could keep fighting to free the world. \n\n\nThis still leaves it a little foggy on whether luffy would have awakened at marineford since he was fighting to free ace but its wasnt for people it was for himself (for most of the arc ace himself didnt want to be saved). So I think that he wouldnt have awakened",

        "text": "Hello Everyone – I wanted to write this message to thank everyone in this community for being really great! I started watching One Piece in November 2021. Since then I am barely on Episode 798th and things have started getting really good. I recently did a video review on my Journey with One Piece and it was impossible to have discuss everything that is happening in One Piece but I did highlight some of the things that I love about this show. I started doing video/audio reviews because I wanted to talk about shows that I love. I just started this year and it’s a very Amateur show with no fancy whistles or special transitions. I am hoping after I have surgery in April and have some time to recover I can really start learning to edit and make the podcast a lot better. If anyone wants to listen to this review, please feel free to do so. I truly have enjoyed this journey with One Piece and I am already starting to get sad thinking that I will soon be caught up with all the episodes. \n\nThere is video if you are listening on Spotify. \n\n[https://open.spotify.com/episode/75HdYKjXAdGG3XSCpc882M?si=7cuaRjmoQqqRujjdxlJKOA](https://open.spotify.com/episode/75HdYKjXAdGG3XSCpc882M?si=7cuaRjmoQqqRujjdxlJKOA)",

Sure, he built the ships for the Raid and all, but the intel and blueprints of Onigashima he got led to nowhere. Would it have been so hard to let him be the one who, after fighting Sasaki, remembers that there are still the many weapons in the secret storeroom? You could use him and Brook as the ones who ultimately make sure that they don't explode, which would give two Straw Hats, who ended up doing relatively little throughout the arc, a somewhat important task during the Raid\n\nAdditionally, I'd flesh his fight with Sasaki out just a bit more. As it stands, Franky only used one new attack against such a supposedly powerful opponent, who then got defeated rather easily. Give him at least one or two more new moves to use and let him show some more emotions after Sasaki destroyed the Iron Pirate. He doesn't need to cry about it (although I could totally see that happen as well), but just give us any reaction towards his creation being destroyed. Let him pick up Sasaki's sword at the end and be like \"Now we're even.\" or something if you want to give Franky some even more powerful stuff, or just don't let the Iron Pirate be fixed at the end of the Arc, just to show that the damage caused by Sasaki is more than something that can be repaired over night. \n\nAlso, I'd let him grow a similar distain towards Queen's sense of technology. It doesn't have to be to the same level as with Chopper, but just let him react to the Ice Oni Virus and how the act of spreading something so vile and toxic will help no one. Before he departs to fight Sasaki, let him interact with Chopper and tell him \"Punch that dude for me as well.\" or something similar. Even if it's just for a little \"older brother/little brother\"-type interaction, I think it would have only added to the confrontation between Chopper and Queen. \n\n \n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/10suysq/you_have_the_opportunity_to_write_hawkins_in/) \\- Hawkins\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/10v431h/you_have_the_opportunity_to_write_the_kid_and/) \\- Kid and Heart Pirates\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/10x4ha4/you_have_the_opportunity_to_write_orochi_in/) \\- Orochi\n\n[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/10yw5h6/you_have_the_opportunity_to_write_zoro_in/) \\- Zoro\n\n[Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/111isx9/you_have_the_opportunity_to_write_yamato_in/) \\- Yamato",
