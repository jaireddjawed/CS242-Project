He got a standing ovation from all the teenage boys present. All meals after that got the same generic prayer with no complaints ever again\n\nTL;DR Cousin was asked to extend a 4 second generic prayer, turned it into a 7 minute speech",

EF was part of a rock group that never really made it. True to a “rocker” lifestyle, EF (with a heavy English accent) would try to excuse his bad behaviors by saying to us “but Im a rocker, sweetie.” EF is sitting in between P and I on the plane and he proceeds to get hammered. This entire trip he did not have to spend a cent on, and yet continued to act as if the world owed him. He spent the 2 hour plane ride proceeding to get 3 Bloody Mary’s in his system, not counting however many he had before stepping foot on the plane itself. We are getting ready to land and the captain tells the passengers to put their tray tables up. The royal EP, however, cannot be bothered to listen to the rules, and expected me to do his dirty work. Why? Just because he could. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEF: OP I need you to put my tray table up for me.\n\nOP: What? NO! Put it up yourself! \n\nEP: I cant! Im a rocker, sweetie! Do it for your Auntie EP (He was REALLY into The show Absolutely Fabulous And would always remark that I acted like Saffy)\n\nOP: Listen, heifer! Youre going to get in trouble if you dont do what the people said and put up your tray table. \n\nEP: I cant, sweetie, Im a rocker! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, having had enough, my father pushed EP’s tray table up, proceeding to knock the full glass of Bloody Mary our of EF’s hands…and straight into his crotch…and I should probably mention that he was wearing white pants…so it looked like he had a bloody…”accident.” To say EF was angry was an understatement. To say he deserved it was also an understatement. Because the plane was landing soon anyway, the flight crew REFUSED to allow him to go into the bathroom and change his clothing. He had to walk with the holy Bloody Mary stain through the airport, through customs, through baggage claim, the whole enchilada (wink wink) with everyone staring at him and silently laughing (and in my case, NOT so silently laughing). To be fair, though, he asked us to put up his tray table. Unfortunately, the next year we went down to Mexico, THE SAME EXACT THING HAPPENED! Some people dont learn their lessons. You know what they say, “Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, become a Reddit Story.”",

I now have aphasia, dyslexic aphasia, and nerve damage. I relearned how to walk, speak, and write. Which was especially difficult since I knew 3 languages (still working on that.)\n\nI came in early for my shift. In a confusing twist the owner asked me what days and times I could work that week. I exchanged a text with them and they sent me a schedule over text. Perfect. I had just been added to the scheduling app which is done by the FOH waitress it had different times but the right days. Since the second schedule didn't work for me I went with what the owner said.\n\nI show up for a shift allegedly early but on time with what I had been sent. I was cussed out by the FOH waitress (Ariel). \"F the owner I don't care what he says, why are you even here? You can't be here. I set the schedule for everyone.\" I say okay and continue my day. I am continually berated for everything...my wardrobe (I was never told what I couldn't wear), things I was supposed to some how know on my 5th day about procedures (no one ever told me), an \"I already told you that so you should know it\", she gave me 6 tables in a row all at the same time(I was setup to fail so she could yell at me more) and the list honestly went on. This went on every 15 minutes literally. I was supposed to leave early that day. Oh boy did this really upset her. Everyone was taken care of except 2 tables needed their check. There were 3 tables left in total. She lost it when I wanted to leave (30 minutes before close) and cussed me out again, made me cry in the front of the house because I could not take it anymore, I had been so degraded. I left without closing out anything because she sat in front of the computer refusing to let me clock out. \n\nThe night before I showed up on time according to what I was sent by the owner. I was the only one who showed up for 2 hours. Well after open. I ran it by myself. One girl called out and the one who was filling in showed up 2 hours later. Ariel knew this and still treated me this way the next day for seemingly no reason. She was having a bad day and took it out on me (the owner agreed).\n\nI started my Malicious Compliance. I will not show up until scheduled by her and we'll see how long that lasts with an unreliable staff. We even had a Saturday night where everyone called out except me. Wish me luck!\n\nBTW the owner was completely on my side. He did not want me to quit and apologized. He said he was fine with me leaving because he knew I wouldn't steal anything. I came back later to close everything out and called him immediately after everything telling him I'd come back and I was sorry. He was completely sympathetic since he knew we talked about me leaving that day.",

In 2006 after i was 18 and gettting into university which is 700 km away my hometown i decided own my phone number, still prepaid. I went second big foreign brand phone store in my country. I gave my credentials and selected very good phone number. i now had my own phone number which is includes my birthday in it, day-month-year. i overpaid 50 dollar but it was worth it.\n\nI went university, prepaid phone. \n\nI graduated from university prepaid phone.\n\nI got a job and started pay my student loan, prepaid phone.\n\nAfter ten years and became debt free i wanted my to be postpaid because data options were good. I called customer service and said i wanted to switch to postpaid phone, even which option i want. They said there was a campaign if i use my phone app and get a postpaid phone number my bill would be %30 cheaper and data would be higher, just need one year commitment. Ok best for me, of course. \n\nAfter everything was settled, a month later my first bill came in the name of Mr Joseph Smith. But there was a problem i wasn't Mr Smith. Immediately i called customer service and explained situation. I asked how that could happen. It was my ten year number. They said in the years when the brand first entered country, store clerks used to get phone numbers in their own names or the names of their relatives in order to catch the quotas. One of them was my number. I asked how i could get this phone number on myself. They said Nope! That isn't possible and advised me not to use this phone number if possible.\n\nI called my lawyer friend, explained the situation and asked about my legal responsibility arising from the use of the phone number. He laughed and said \"you have no responsibility even if you dont pay the bill\".  I was upset that i was going to lose my ten year old birthday phone number. So i logged into my game and bought in-game currency via phone numberwith the maximum limit of 2480 dollar. Either company find the owner of the number, he pays or the company pays itself.\n\nThere was no legal responsibility fror me. I enjoyed the game with the game items i bought. \n\nIt's been 6 years and still no news. ",

We're talking 75 cases each of champagne, white, and red; plus beer, spirits and soft drinks.\n\nI drive the 40 odd miles out to the castle's gate-house, where I'm stopped and greeted by a member of security (MoS) who asks for the password.\n\nMe: \"I'm sorry. What?\"\n\nMoS: \"The password. I'm not allowed to let anyone pass without the secret password.\"\n\nThese days I'd have just phoned my boss or asked the security chap to call the wedding organisers and it'd be sorted in a jiffy. These were pre mobile phone days, and we were at an impasse.\n\nMe: \"You are joking, right? I have a van full of champagne for the wedding guests. Feel free to inspect the vehicle.\"\n\nMoS: \"I'm sorry, those are the rules. No password, no entry.\"\n\nMe: \"Sure, but this is on you when there's no booze for the wedding.\"\n\nMoS: \"I'm just doing as I'm told.\"\n\nSo we both did as we were told. I about-turned and headed back to the warehouse, where my boss nearly had an aneurism on discovering I had returned with many thousand of £s worth of booze.\n\nLuckily for me, I had an evening shift at another job to get to, and left the van for some other schmuck to take back to the wedding. \n\nThe fall-out: the booze got back before the guests arrived, but I doubt they had time to chill it all. My manager was never given a password, so he was off the hook. The wedding organiser was to blame, but sadly I don't know what repercussions there were.",

Dolly gave him the checks and Clyde says \"Thank you, darlin.\" Perhaps is was the stress of trying to get ahead on work because the the missed workday, stress from the Holidays in general, or the fact that Clyde was a young, goofy looking, redheaded redneck but Dolly's professionalism left her for that moment. \"I'm not your darling! Don't call me that.\" was her response. Clyde nodded and left as quickly as he could, I imagine. \n\nThe Outcome: Upon hearing this from Clyde I was in a bit of a quandary. As I have used the exact same phrase, many times I am sure, with Dolly. I had no idea that she didn't care for that word. So I mended my ways then and there and never used it again when speaking to her. It was always \"Yes Ma'am\" and \"No Ma'am\" from then on.",

I happened to be prepared for just this situation. I asked if they had anything smaller, and they said they didn't. As I said, cue malicious compliance.

So, naturally I was talking to the person sitting next to me, out of the four of us in the class. And the other two were talking as well. Then, out of no-where (but probably somewhere), the teacher said to me to go for a walk. No reason stated, but probably because I was talking. But she only told me, and not the other three that were talking. So, I got up, walked out of the classroom, and started a walk on my Apple Watch. Now, our school is three levels high and we are on the top floor, so I took advantage of that. I walked right to the end of the at least 100 metre corridor, said hi to a teacher, then walked down the stairs, walked back to the other side of the corridor, walked down the stairs, said hi to another teacher who also isn’t a fan of the Italian teacher, walked to the other end of the corridor, up the stairs, other end of the corridor, up the stairs, then right back into the classroom if you’ve been paying attention lol. She was upset but I told her she didn’t specify, so she should’ve expected it from me. And by the time I got back to the classroom the lesson had ended. So that was nice. \n\nAnyway thanks for reading. I think it was kinda messy, but gets the point across. \n(Also, I never realised how laggy an iPhone’s keyboard is when typing, it is very hard.)",

When I tried to argue that they didn't provide receipts, I was shot down, so I paid the $15 out of pocket. \n\nThe following year, I went to the same conference and wanted to avoid paying out of pocket, so I read the expense policy, which said that out-of-pocket expenses will only get reimbursed with \"proof of purchase\". Of course, this implied a receipt, but since it didn't explicitly state it, I saw an opportunity for malicious compliance.\n\nWhen I went to get my coat and bags checked, I whipped out my phone and recorded the entire transaction -- me taking cash out of my wallet, handing it to the clerk, them taking my cash, and checking in my stuff. I even added a title card with \"AvocadoAlternative's proof of purchase for bag check at Conference on Date\", a \"Thanks for watching!\" outro, and added some corporate music on top of it. My manager thought it was hilarious. Since the expense software didn't take video files, I submitted attached the video to an email and sent it off to the expense team. They asked if I had a receipt, and I replied that since they didn't give out receipts, I recorded video that complied with the proof policy. I ended up getting reimbursed with no further questions.",

For that one quarter with out looking at any other data. \n\nWe lost our company car entitlement and the company told us we had to return the the the fleet company at the end of their leases. \n\nMalicious compliance activated. \n\nAs we were project engineers we had a very particular set of skills for knowing how to follow rules to the letter and how to do so in a manner that benefitted the company or project or individuals. Usually if it benefitted the company it benefitted all involved. This was not one of those occasions. \n\nWe pay benefit in kind tax on our company cars in the uk, the rules around this changes as and when the government feel like it. My team had all carefully chosen out cars to be zero cost to our selves by choosing cars that were below the allowance of £300 month so the remaining allowance covered the tax obligation. We’d all be screwed by the benefit in kind tax changes that year and were now paying tax. \n\nSo for starters we reviewed the company car policy, and found the company had no way of stopping us handing our cars back with immediate affect,  whilst the company was still responsible for the leases. So we all made arrangements for personal cars and handed our keys over at the next team meeting. \n\nWe’d also reviewed the company travel policy. \n\nWe started using hire cars and trains for travelling. (Trains and hire cars in the uk are not cheap) As non of us were willing to use our personal cars and claim the 50p per mile. \n\nUsually we’d work a long day and book a bit of over time or lieu to drive to and from meetings with out staying over as we would prefer to be at home even if it meant getting home late. That stopped with immediate effect. We’d only work the mandated 7.5 hour day then stop book into a hotel and take full advantage of the £25 food and drink allowance for dinner. Then work from home the following day as we’d been away from home the previous day, as per the policy. \n\nAfter about 8 weeks we were called into a meeting with our line manager and dept manager about our expenses. Our expenses for the first month after the cars had been returned were more than they were for the previous 12 months combined. Our line manager agreed that our expenses were inline with the policy otherwise he wouldn’t have signed them off. The dept manager told us we were getting company cars back and he expected the expenses to return to previous levels. \n\nWe declined the “offer” of company cars and let management know we’d be adhering to the travel policy to the letter. \n\nTldr;Large company spends magnitudes more money by implementing cost savings.",

One night we reported for midnight shift, and this welder was instructed by the boss to scrap out a hydraulic pressure vessel located on the factory floor next to the rolling mill.  The unit had gone bad and was scheduled to be replaced by a brand new one on the previous shift. \nThis was a very large (about the size of a transit van) and very, very expensive piece of equipment. Tim was halfway through a double shift and knew that the pressure vessel hadn’t yet been swapped out with the new one. The unit on the floor was the brand new one. Tim knew this, of course. The boss obviously did not. We never saw Tim jump up so fast and run out of the lineup room to get started on his assigned job! By the time the boss decided to go out and check up on the progress of all of the jobs he had assigned, Tim was standing in the middle of a sea of tiny parts, drenched in sweat, with his lit torch in his right hand. “I did exactly what you told me to do boss! You have anything else for me?”",

        "text": "Ages ago, I worked a front-line job at city hall, registering cars and dogs and collecting money for parking tickets, property taxes and the like. So, a basic entry-level municipal finance grunt, bottom of the food chain, nowhere close to being the one making the ordinances or rules, etc. Grunt. This was before the days of taking credit cards and debit cards for such payments, before smartphones, before the online banking world really began. Ages ago. Paper paper paper.\n \nThe city’s ordinance on tax interest stated that interest would accrue daily against any past-due tax bill at a rate of blah blah %per annum. Property taxes were due quarterly. Many people would come in to pay cash on the tax due date. Many, many more would remit their payment by checks through the mail. We kept extremely thorough paper records of all payments received through the mail, retaining their remittance stub, the envelope bearing the postmark (which was the date we would use to calculate any interest if it arrived past the due date. If the postmark was before or on the due date, no interest was charged.) These were batched daily by each clerk, filed by date in our vault so anyone who needed to could find any receipt/remittance fairly quickly. We needed to, often, as did the city auditor.\n \nAnyway, business as usual and the few days following the tax due we would always get a few stragglers through the mail, and the daily interest would have started adding up. Not by a lot - for most homeowners this would amount to just a few cents a day. We would send them a receipt in the mail with a note that they have a small balance now due to accrued interest, but we would hold it at the amount for 10 days. Most people would just send another check, some would ignore it, and others would come in to pay in person.\n \nFinally, the stars aligned and I got one, a real peach of a gentleman who was extremely disgruntled that he got a bill in the mail for this “goddamn interest bullshit”, which he slapped down on the counter inches from my face. He then slammed a repurposed melatonin bottle full of pennies down on top of the paper and said, “I hope whoever sent me this goddamn bill has to count these goddamn pennies!” at top volume for all of city hall to hear. I could tell already that it was mine, I saw my initials on the receipt when he slapped it down. Cue malicious compliance.\n \nI smiled as big as I could, said I would find out who had processed it and took his receipt to the vault. I didn’t even give him enough time to react, I just got up and went to the vault while  cheerfully saying “it’ll just be a minute!” before disappearing from his sight.  I found the paperwork, including his two days late postmarked envelope. Then I sat down at my desk, took the melatonin bottle, looked him in the eye and said “You’re in luck today, sir! I’m the one who sent this balance due to you so I will be able to count these pennies for you!” And I did. I counted all thirty-nine of those goddamn pennies, and I counted them one by one, very very thoroughly. It took him about 20 minutes to pay his fucking $0.39 from the minute that bottle hit the counter to the end of it. I was extremely pleasant and cordial and smiling at him the entire time. It was just fun at that point so I kept pouring it on, just so sweet. \n\nHis face was practically purple by the end, and as he slunk out the door (without the smug satisfaction he was expecting when he slammed that melatonin bottle on my counter), I said “Have a great rest of your day! Weather’s beautiful!” And it was.",

This rule was introduced to us as any other was, so we knew no different.\n\nWhen I was 11, my eldest step brother's missus had a baby. My sister and I were told we were aunties, everyone had a titter at us being such young aunties.\n\nOf course, the next Sunday we both sat at the dining table and leant on our elbows.

It was a real feast or famine situation when it came to work so some days it'd be real slow and others we'd be slammed all day long. They were real sticklers about hours and didn't want any overtime. I was the opening tech do when it was slow I would usually go up to my manager and offer to go home early so I could work late on the days he really needed me. He seemed slightly annoyed by this but I figured I was helping him out so I would still ask on days when it was slow if I should clock out early. Well one day we were totally dead by around 11am and I asked him if I should leave and he flipped out something serious. Starts screaming at me and telling me he's in charge and \"I tell you when to go home and you don't leave until I tell you to!\". You got it, bud. The next two weeks I stayed every day until he told me to go home. Problem is he never told me to leave so I worked open to close 6 days a week. I had 168 hours on that check. Of course he comes back out LOSING IT at me for having an insane amount of overtime. I just stood there until I could finally get a word in and I pointed out he told me not to leave until he said so and he never told me to leave. He immediately tried to deny this but, thankfully, my service manager jumped in and corroborated my story, she was laughing through the whole thing because she knew what I'd been doing but was gonna let the boss learn a lesson. This was especially hard on me because I was working two jobs at the time but I needed the money and hey, he told me to do it. From that day on if I came to him and suggested I leave early he was not just ok with it but thankful because he finally realized what I was doing was helping both of us.",

        "text": "In the early 2000s when I first moved out on my own, I rented from a complex that charged you for assigned parking. It was an upcharge of $25 a month. If you didn't get assigned parking, you would have to fight for a space on the street. My apartment was in the back of the complex and I was getting over a recent knee and ankle injury, so I opted for paid parking that was relatively close to my front door. My car was a junker, 3 years older than I am, but it ran semi-okay and the heater worked. As a newly minted adult, I was happy to have it.\n\nAbout 3 months into my lease, my car went to the great scrapheap in the sky. I had gotten used to the local transit system and discovered a nearby store would drop off groceries for me. This was long before Walmart and other stores started doing it, so it was cheaper than figuring a month's supplies on the bus. So I opted not to replace the car and utilize the bus pass my work reimbursed me for. I went to my leasing office and told them I no longer needed the space, and would you please remove the extra charge from my bill. The manager at the desk was new and had never been asked that before. She promised to look into it and let me know. I was naive and figured it would be gone come next month. Nope! It was still there. I paid all but the parking space and called up the complex. Same girl. She said she was awaiting word from higher ups and offered me a credit for the charge as a one-time courtesy. I reminded her that I no longer owned a car -- I hadn't just changed my mind. I told her that the space had been empty for close to a month now and that I won't be utilizing it. She said she understood \"loud and clear\" and would get it sorted by next month. 3 days before rent was due, she finally got back to me. Apparently, it was in my lease and couldn't be removed without breaking the lease and signing a new one. Even if I didn't move out, the lease breaking and initiation fees would be charged to me, and my rent would go up to the new current market value. This would be over a thousand dollars, so not an option for someone freshly on their own. I kept the parking space on the lease.\n\n3 weeks later, I was reviewing my lease to get the phone number for maintenance, and noticed the clause for the parking space. Essentially, I could park \"a motorcycle, scooter such as vespa, car, truck, suv, or *trailer*\" in the space. Gears were TURNING! For me to be in compliance, I had to have wheels on anything parked in my space. So I went to my local version of Craigslist and found a wheeled container similar to a shipping container. It wasn't cheap but it was worth every cent. The complex offered storage sheds at an upcharge too. Being fresh out of High School, I didn't have much to store. My neighbor though, did. I threw a lock on the unit and offered it to my neighbor for half the cost of a shed; $35 a month. He was able to move his stuff out of his storage unit where he was paying over $100 a month, and the container was available 24-7-365. He was happy for the arrangement and paid several months in advance. \n\nThe complex put several tow stickers for \"out of compliance\" on the trailer, but I called the Tow Company and faxed them a copy of the lease where it says trailers are allowed. The container was registered with the county as a utility trailer, so there's nothing they could do. They tried to fine me for improper parking, but again, I had proof I was within my rights. They even offered to remove the charge for parking on my lease if I would relocate the container. With what my neighbor was paying, I could cover my water bill every month, so I declined. \n\nI stayed 18 months, and sold the trailer to my neighbor when I moved out. He had to rent a car to relocate it to his assigned space, but he said it was worth the couple hundred he paid. He ended up saving over $1000 a year renting from me. Other neighbors even started bringing in their own containers too, even if it meant getting a second space. Sheds were being vacated at such a large volume, the complex tried to give them away at 6 months free. Few took them up on it. The amended the new leases to exclude trailers, but could do nothing about those that already had them in the spot. Instead of moving out and giving notice, renters would reassigned their lease to new people so they could be grandfathered into the trailer clause. \n\nI drove by the facility 2 years or so after I moved out, going to a friends for Thanksgiving. The complex had been sold to a new owner and changed their name. But wouldn't you know, there were still about a dozen wheeled shipping containers parked in the lot.",

My cousin, \"Mike,\" probably saw Return of the Jedi a dozen times opening weekend. He knew all the lines by heart, and could re-enact the movie quite faithfully. \n\nA few months after the movie came out, uncle \"Simon\" was getting married. Mike was ring bearer.  Uncle Simon is very strict about punctuality, but he was also the class clown. Allegedly, Uncle Simon reminded Mike's parents, \"Be sure to come on time. Being ring bearer is very important.\" Mike's parents told Mike to, \"get in your formal wear. We leave in x minutes.\"\n\nMike came downstairs...his pants are knotted at the ends, his jacket is stuffed in his pants, his dress shirt is tied around his neck like a chain. His pants are belted on to his head...his superman underoos are prominently displayed for all to see. He's doing an interpretive dance and saying he is dancing in jabba's palace (just like in Return of the Jedi).\n\nHis parents are sick of his smart aleck ways, and given Simon's reminder, take Mike \"as is\" to the wedding... Uncle Simon understands technicalities, and the double dose this is, he's also a joker and thinks it is hilarious. Mike thinks he's 'the man' for \"tricking the old people\"/all the complements he is getting for his underoos. The elders are in various states of appalment, condemnation or mirth, the latter commensurate with their alcohol consumption.\n\nNow, this wedding didn't have a whole video production like they do in modern weddings. However, we still had pictures, including many family photos. Family photos with one person prominently in underoos. Pictures that sat in various photo albums, many undisturbed for decades.\n\nMike's kid sister \"Maya\" is generally polite and well behaved. Having two older brothers, she learned to throw-down with the best of them (physically and verbally). She also has been cataloging their parents belongings (dad passed, mom moved in with her) including scanning many old photos... \n\nYears ago, we're all at Maya's house for Thanksgiving. Mike is being a prick and makes fun of Maya for her wild child days. Maya retorts, \"that's rich coming from you 'underoos!\"\n\nMike doesn't know what she's talking about, and she starts explaining. Mike realizes what she's talking about but denies it. Mike's kids think it's hilarious that \"daddy used to run around in his superman underwear at weddings.\" Mike is very embarrassed but doubles down. \"Oh yeah? Pics or it didn't happen!\"\n\n\"Well, since you put it that way....\" Maya pulled up her phone, furiously tapped the screen and then: &lt;everyone's phone pings&gt;. \n\nTo this day, you can whisper \"underoos\" and we'll all start giggling like idiots... :)",

I really enjoyed everyone I got in contact with any in all my time there I'd never experienced any bad blood between anyone. To put simply, everyone was very understanding of each other and open minded. \n\nEnter a guy who I'll call José for simplicity. You see, José had a special character in his name, something that I'd noticed but never really addressed because... why would I? When emailing him, tagging him in different places, etc, his name obviously didn't carry that special character, but he still used it on our messaging platform. One day, I needed to send him a private message and I started off with a simple 'Hey Jose!'. \n\nHe did mention that he'd like me to spell his name correctly, and I honestly thought it was all in good fun, but I explained that I'd never used that character before in writing, my keyboard wasn't set up for it, etc. I thought that was the end of that, but apparently no. I wasn't immediately pulled aside by a higher up, but during a 1:1 meeting later on I was told I should be mindful of peoples' names. I could tell that the person delivering this news wasn't thrilled about it, but the issue had been escalated nonetheless, so they had to remind me. I thought nothing of it since I had very little to do with José anyway. \n\nBut, lo and behold, a couple of months later I had to message him again, this time in a group setting. After a little back and forth I thanked everyone individually for their input and because I'd forgotten about the name incident before I simply said \"thank you, Jose.\" \n\nYou can imagine that during my next 1:1, this issue was brought up again. This time I was a little miffed, but I said 'you know what, you're right. I'm clearly in the wrong here'... queue malicious compliance. \n\nYou see, my name also has a special character, but it's not a frequently seen one since I'm from an Eastern European country. Safe to say that nobody else in the company even knew of it's existence. I'd also assured people that they can call me by my 'english' name, which is much easier to pronounce. Well, not anymore. During that same 1:1 I told my higher up that I now expect everyone to call me by my correct name, special character and all. \n\nWould you be surprised if I told you that José was one of the first to complain that MY special character isn't easily accessible on his keyboards? He actually had the audacity to contact me privately to complain that his name was a special case since it's more widely used, and the special character is \"well known\" whereas mine isn't, and I shouldn't feel \"special\" about it. \n\nTo make matters worse, the next times I had to write down his name, and I made sure I did it often, I didn't actually type it down and instead copied and pasted it from google, and it would always, without fail paste the Wikipedia article about his name too, so my messages looked clunky as all hell. Nobody judged me for it, and José avoided me like the plague whenever he could. Trouble was, he needed me more than I needed him, so he was forced to suffer by writing out my name properly far, far more often than I guess he expected!",

But, on my way out, I would like to tell a more detailed version of this and the previous 2 years exchange to their supervisor.

This way I'm \"complying\" with the advisors \"request\" that I fuck off, but that they get the attention from the supervisor they deserve. Something like maybe a question that should be directed at my regular advisor, but I go up the chain and they ask why? Or any better ideas are very welcome",

My dad on the other hand didn't share my enthusiasm &amp; felt it should only be played during the Christmas season. Finally we came to an agreement, I could start playing it once the greatest Christmas movie ever, Christmas Vacation, was on tv.\n\nOne year (at least 20 years ago) I was in my bedroom channel surfing in April &amp; saw that indeed Christmas Vacation was on tv. Naturally I turned it and grabbed one of my Christmas cds (there was no such thing as streaming music then younglings). My bedroom was on the second floor right above the living room where my dad was watching tv. I made sure that it was loud enough for him to hear. He then peaks his head into the stairwell to yell about playing it out of season. I told him to remember his rule and go check channel (whatever it was).\n\nI then turn down my music a bit to heat his reaction. It was hard to make out, but he was definitely grumbling as he knew that he couldn't say a thing. Score 1 for me",

It finally backfired on him and I lost my shit!! He played MC with our internet and told the internet company to go ahead and disconnect his router/modem and schedule a tech to come out next week. Ultimately when he told me what he did, I busted out laughing and called him out. I said so you’ve been using MC non stop! Here’s where’s your busted!

I’m glad you cut off the internet and now you and everyone else gets to suffer and you’re the cause!! I pranced off to my room laughing that finally everyone saw what he did and proved that he’s been doing this for weeks!! It’s been calm for a day but I don’t expect it to last much longer. Have you ever dealt with a situation like this? No, moving out isn’t an option. I need ways to effectively stop this from happening anymore because I can’t cope with the bs or disloyalty and there’s no getting through to him that he’s ruining absolutely all trust and destroying our relationship. It’s complicated because he’s been dealing with medical problems and serotonin syndrome from his doctors blatantly giving him meds that interact and cause SS.

        "text": "To start, not sure if this is more malicious compliance or petty revenge. Either way, the story is the same.\n\nThis literally just happened ten minutes ago. To start, I'm a thirty three year old, and I've been working for a company for almost four years. I have a co-worker, let's call her Mel. She is one of the most flakey and inconsiderate people I have ever had the displeasure of working with. She calls out all the time, takes days off randomly and even just doesn't show up some days. How she still even holds her position is beyond me. We hold the same position, so any time she is out, *I* get to cover for all her work. Anyways, we traditionally both clock out at around 4:00 PM. Now, before I get to the story, I'd like to point out my company works on the day after Thanksgiving and it is one of the busiest and most vital days out of the year. We are expected to work that day every year. Fast forward to Wednesday, the day before Thanksgiving. I clocked out at 4:00, like usual, and excitedly worked on the prep work for my family's holiday meal. We had a great holiday and shared our thanks for all we have in our lives! Well, along comes today. Again, one of the *busiest* days of the year. Can you guess who's email comes across my inbox? Yup, Mel.\n\nHere is verbatim what she said, \"Thanks in advance for covering on Friday! I have nothing open that needs to be watched. Just coverage for \\[her customer\\]. Happy Thanksgiving!!\"\n\nOn any other day, I would have chalked it up to typical Mel and would suck it up and cover for her. However, almost two months ago, I put in a request to be able to leave work early today for an MRI follow up appointment that might have some really catastrophic news behind it...I'm not going to go into detail, because it's quite personal. I've been waiting almost two months to have this done and I finally got the MRI and a follow up with the doctor weeks after. My boss approved it almost two months ago, I put it on the shared calendar for Mel and I AND I sent an email informing her about it.\n\nNow, let me point out that her email on Wednesday was sent at 4:30 PM, well after when she knew I would be clocked out! She was so spineless that she couldn't even properly ask me because she knew I would decline because of my appointment. She left me absolutely no choice. Blindsided me. No one else can cover our job, so, what choice do I have? How cowardly and selfish do you have to be to do that to someone? I emailed my boss and informed him that under no circumstance can I miss this appointment today, he hasn't responded yet, but I'm not backing down. I cannot stress enough how important this appointment is to discuss life changing treatment plans with my doctor pending the diagnosis. I doubt he'll have any push back seeing he approved the initial request though. I also informed him I am willing to cover, but only until I need to leave early for my appointment.\n\nOkay Mel, you want me to cover for you? Fine. Cue malicious compliance/petty revenge.\n\nIn the best interest of the company, I will cover for her properly until I leave for my appointment. Now, for the revenge.\n\nI'm a patient person, and the revenge won't come until this time next year. We get a floating holiday that we can tack on to any company issued holiday as a one time deal. I still have my floating holiday. As soon as the clock strikes midnight and we transition into the year 2023, I'll be putting in my request for a floating holiday the day after Thanksgiving for next year. Company policy for the floating holiday is first come, first serve. Once my boss gives me the green light, I will go on my merry way for the next 11 months. Next year, come the day before Thanksgiving, I will be sending out an email to my boss, fellow co workers...and of course Mel. I plan on saying something along the lines of, \"Thanks in advance for covering on Friday! I have nothing open that needs to be watched. Just coverage for \\[my customers\\]. Happy Thanksgiving!\" Maybe I'll send it around 3:00PM, just to be sure she can't build a defense of \"But I didn't see the request\" or whatever bullshit excuse she comes up with.\n\nSo until then. I'm biding my time. Waiting for that beautiful moment when I send the request in at the start of wonderful 2023. Happy holidays everyone!",

        "text": "Disclaimer: Non native, bad formating.   \nSome 14 years ago I was working my first job out of highschool, I was working as a phone operator over summer for social services.   \nAt the time I was happy for the job but I also felt somewhat guilty for getting it as my bosses boss boss boss just so happened to be my mother. It wasn't mentioned in the interview but I could clearly tell the person interviewing me knew as she was rather advertising herself and her department than actually interviewing me. This lead to me going in with a determination to not only prove myself but to excell at what I was doing.   \nTurns out that it's quite difficult to get hold of just anyone at the social services during summer break (Sweden more or less shuts down during summer). As it happens I was still living with my mother at the time and while eating dinner together I complained about the difficulty of getting hold of the correct people. It frequently happened that people didn't sign out their phones or redirect them properly and therefore people seeking help didn't get their issues resolved and in some cases did not have money for food and the like. At this point my mother told me that if I was unable to get hold of someone in a department I should just forward them to the person above them.   \nI'm sure you can see where this is going!\n\n   \nThe phone operator has the power to forward calls even when people are checked out for holiday! I figured that since my mother was the top dog I would just forward the calls to her if I was unable to help people get their issues resolved. Turns out that my mother doesn't much enjoy working on her holidays and really didn't enjoy the reason for her having to work was that people didn't pick up their phones when they were supposed to.   \nThis lovely piece of malicious compliance lasted for a whole two days!   \nTurns out that people get a lot better at picking up their phones when they either pick it up or get hunted down by the top boss who's currently on holiday.   \nTwo days later a very serious looking delegation (seven people in suits) showed up at my tiny telephone operator office with lists of who would be avaiable what hours of the day and who was a backup for who in case the line was full or the first one for some reason failed to pick up.   \nTurns out people get a lot better at their jobs when they realize that their bosses son is the one watching them, talking to all their clients and gossiping with the top boss over dinner.  \n\nWhen I spoke with my mother after the fact it turned out that she did not expect me to start using her as the backup drain for all the calls that couldn't be connected properly. Also turns out she enjoys her time off and after the calls I forwarded to her she would call the person who the call should have gone to herself and ask why things weren't working as intended. Seems that piece of news spread like wildfire.",

        "text": "At my former employer, a new policy was put into place that all contracts had to be reviewed and approved by legal before anyone could sign them. No minimum dollar amount, no exceptions for ongoing or routine agreements, every single contract had to be approved. Before this we only had to have approval for anything above $10,000 so this was really a huge change in operations so of course no one who was affected by the policy was involved in making the policy. \n\nMy department which was focused on community engagement and involvement had a lot of small, routine “contracts” of about $50-$100 that were basically an essential part of doing business. Think like a “contract” to sponsor a high school event or to attend a breakfast in return for advertising. Most of the asks we got had about a 2-6 week timeframe of needing to be involved, but since they were things we did every single year wasn’t a big deal cause we knew it was coming. Well I questioned if we had to have these approved and yes, we did. Cue malicious compliance. \n\nSee, before anything could go to legal it also had to be approved by the division Vice President and HR. So I started getting my requests and put together a cover sheet of who needed to approve it, and where to route it once approved, with dates. I got the request, gave my approval, routed it on, and….waited. \n\nTwo months later when I finally got the approval from legal I had great joy in replying to all on the approval chain “the deadline to be involved in this opportunity has passed.” After about three events in a row that we were noticeably absent from, yet all of our competitors attended, which would have cost us maybe $200 total to be involved in, we were told we could use our discretion on routine events.",

        "text": "I decided I'd post my own pizza related malicious compliance story since there have been a couple posted lately and they reminded me a lot of mine. It's kinda similar, but it gave me a good laugh remembering it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI used to work at one of the Top 4, most well known pizza establishments. No, not the one named after a popular tile-based table top game, and not the one named after a father figure named  Johnathan, or the one named after a small amount of a salad dressing named after a roman emperor. That should narrow it down pretty well, right? \n\nANYWAYS, We  had a customer who always called near closing and asked for 'extra black olives'. \n\n   I would always put exactly what we were told to put for toppings, then add the exact amount we were told to put for 'extra'. Well, EVERY time these people would call back and say there wasn't enough, that 'the cook' hadn't put 'extra' black olives on... even though I definitely had, because I WAS the cook and the only one in store at this time since we would only staff 1 person in store (the MoD) and 1 or 2 drivers (10-11pm). So because I made the pizza, I knew their claim about there not being enough was BS, but part of our training for complaints was B.L.A.S.T.  (Believe, Listen, Apologize, Satisfy, and Thank). So even though I knew there were plenty of black olives I'd make them another pizza and send it out. A lot of times this would cause both myself and a driver to have to stay late, and these customers were extremely rude and NEVER tipped. \n\nFor some reason they were always satisfied with the amount on the second pizza even though I just remade it and put the same amount of 'extra' on as the first one. That was because they were just trying to get a 2nd pizza free, and it had worked for them numerous times in the past. \n\n  Well..after going through the same thing nearly once every week or two for a couple months I decided I was done, and that I would play a bit of a game of my own.\n\nThe next time they ordered when they called and asked for extra black olives, I decided I'd just go ahead and put a little more than 'extra' on so they wouldn't have to call back, right? Well, guess what, they DID call back and as always, very rudely claimed there weren't enough olives (there were A TON of them).\n\nIt was at this point that I decided I would comply with their wishes :)  So on the 2nd pizza I covered the entire top completely with black olives. You literally couldn't see anything underneath them at all. The original 'extra' olives pizzas didn't seem good to begin with, but to be honest I knew this one probably wasn't even edible. \n\nThe customer called back rudely yelling as expected, so I told them that I had put more than the amount we were supposed to for 'extra' on the first pizza and it wasn't enough for them.. So I made SURE I put enough on the 2nd that they wouldn't have to call back for a remake since they loved black olives so much! I also told him that the jig was up, I knew they were using the black olive thing to get free pizza, and that we weren't going to be remaking any more orders for them.\n\n Surprisingly they DID continue to order from us, but after that night they were always fine with the amount of black olives on the first pizza sent out :)",

So if the customer submits something on our customer portal and the balance is under $20 and they don’t pay it immediately, it’ll be gone the next day. I mean, it’s pretty obvious why we don’t tell anyone. We want them to pay their balance before the system writes it off. Most people pay their balance immediately anyway so it never comes up. \n\nSo, here’s this lady. She called in because she didn’t pay her balance the night she submitted her information, and the next day the system wrote it off.

She and I went back and forth for a while with me explaining the write off to her and her being absolutely pissed about it. \n\nWell, as an in person rep, not only could I restore her balance, I could also **completely disable the automatic write offs** for all of her accounts. After restoring her balance and taking her payment, I apologized for the inconvenience and assured her that it would never happen again.",

        "text": "This malicious compliance is not my own. It was related to me by my mother many decades ago, but it is also not hers. She just got to play her part in the story. But since she died decades before Reddit existed for her to share it with all you wonderful people, I'll pass it on for her.\n\nThis is a case of an intended malicious compliance being countered by an even more malicious compliance. \n\nMy mother is at this time a manager in the central processing office of a now defunct major regional bank -- easily the largest bank in our region back in the day.\n\nShe receives a rather odd check for processing, and refuses to run it until she has the full story on what is happening. So here's what she learns:\n\nA rancher has been in a land dispute with one of his neighbors, and it has not gone amicably. We are not privy to the exact nature of the issue, but it seems to have something to do with water rights. Either way, it ends up in court. And after a long, hard fought battle of legal wills, the rancher loses and is ordered to pay a certain amount of damages to his neighbor by a certain date.\n\nWell, that is not a happy thing for the rancher. So he decides that while he must pay, there is absolutely nothing in the court order that says he has to make it easy on his adversary. Malicious compliance engaged: He shaves a spot on the rump of one of his cows, and carefully writes out a check for the full amount of the court ordered damages on the skin of the bovine. He then has one of his trucks deliver the cow to his neighbor to settle the account. A live chewing, pooping cow!\n\nAfter checking with the bank, the neighbor concludes that it is perfectly legal for the rancher to write a check on *anything* and the rancher makes it perfectly clear that this is the only way he intends to settle the debt. \n\nBut just like folks who decide to settle an annoying bill with thousands of coins sometimes find themselves victims of their own malicious intent, the neighbor's malicious compliance trumps the rancher's.\n\nThe neighbor loads the cow onto one of his own trucks, and takes it to the rancher's bank - the bank of issuance - and cashes it against a cashier's check made out to him for the same amount. This he then deposits at his own bank with no difficulty or challenge.\n\nMeanwhile, the rancher's bank has to order a truck and driver to deliver the cow-check to it's central processing office, several hours drive away. This is where my mother comes into the story. She has to cancel the check and process it. (She uses a paper substitute to run through the computer system for it, just like they do for any checks that come in that are too badly wrinkled or damaged to run safely through the system.) \n\nAfter the cow-check has been properly processed, and the money deducted from the rancher's account, she then opts to not store the check with his other cancelled checks to return with his monthly statement, but instead orders it returned immediately to the rancher. \n\nAnd then, after the dust settles, the real fall-out of the neighbor's malicious compliance is felt: Since the cow-check involves a great deal of special handling at the bank's expense, the bank assesses appropriate fees that more than cover the expenses in processing it. If the neighbor cashes it at his own bank, he gets to pay those fees. But since he cashes it at the rancher's bank, the rancher now gets to pay what amounts to an additional 25% fee on top of the court ordered settlement. The only cost to the neighbor was ten miles of gas for the round trip to the bank -- a trip he routinely makes anyway -- and the time spent getting the bank to verify that the cow-check is a legitimate instrument that can be cashed. \n\nWhen telling me this story, my mother tells me it is the most expensive check she ever processed.",

        "text": "Someone posted a pizza story and it's sending me back so here's a good one from me to you.\n\nI used to sling pizza and I had this one couple who would regularly come in and order a specialty pizza (think meat lovers) but with 3x the amount of toppings. Like extra extra everything plus they would add extra extra of other toppings that weren't originally on that pizza like olives and onions. \n\nSo of course this meant that it never cooked thoroughly (even after sending it through the oven twice+). Every single time they would complain about the pizza being to burnt on the edges and not cooked enough, and it took to long and they also wanted more of the toppings. \n\nI tried repeatedly to explain to them that every extra topping you add makes the portion size of all the toppings go down. I don't even understand why we were allowed to add so many toppings on at the register. \n\nAnyways, about the 5th or 6th time I replaced the pizza for them (because the kept complaining to 'corporate' and received credit) the man came in again and said they spoke to corporate and corporate wants me to make the pizza the way they want it. I knew that isn't true (there really wasn't a corporate customers could call, just a call center and those people did NOT care) but I decided I'd do exactly what they asked, but made sure to explain to them that if I made it their way and it didn't turn out well they wouldn't be getting anymore remakes. I took the order and made it as they were expecting..kind of. \n\nI put full portions of each topping on that monster. To say that that pizza was a fucking mountain is an understatement. It didn't even fit in the oven. I had to take toppings off lol. I did fell a little bad a this point knowing full well they paid (with the store credit) over $40 for this 1 pizza and there was NO way it would ever properly cook, so I did give it 2 runs through the oven but that still didn't help. \n\nIt was pan to pan toppings so getting out of the pan sucked and I just put and cut it right in the box so the toppings wouldn't fall everywhere, after I cut it the slices disappeared under the toppings and you couldn't even see crust so it just looks like a giant pile of trash toppings dumped in a box. I couldn't even close it lol. \n\nI brought it to the customer and he started to lose it on me saying it took too long and it looked like a mess and he wanted another credit. I pulled out his receipt and asked which part wasn't up to par. He said it didn't look cooked and I reminded him how I warned him of that with this amount of toppings and I would've cooked it longer if he hadn't been complaining about time (I also showed him the at home cooking time and temps on the box). I showed him the crust underneath and went through all the toppings and extras.\n\nEverything was accounted for as he asked for it so I told him I'd let management and corporate know that it was made to his liking. Never saw them again.",

        "text": "So there I was, on a nice afternoon, just after lunch, standing the pier access security watch, at pier 3, Norfolk Naval Base. This would have been about 2002, I was a 2nd Class (E5) stationed aboard USS Minneapolis-Saint Paul (SSN708). Pier access was pretty simple. Vehicles came through the vehicle access gate, with proper credentials, people came through the personnel access turnstile only. I could allow my commanding officer access by visual recognition,  but for EVERYONE else, I was required to check (hold in my hand) their military ID, before allowing access. During our morning muster, we were informed that the CNO was on the base that day, and that there was the possibility of him visiting the boats on pier 3. About an hour into my watch, these 2 LT's (O3) walk up, tell me that the CNO is a couple minutes away, and that I was not to \"slow his roll\" by checking his ID. They offered their id's to \"vouch for him\" and pointed to his photo in my guard shack, indicating that I could identify him based on his photo. I indicated to the LT's that my standing orders required me to check I'd, but if they would like, they could call the Squadron Duty Officer, on the phone in my guard shack, to request an exception for the CNO. They declined the phone call offer, and ordered me to pass the CNO without ID check ---we can all guess where this is going, right?--- I replied that their order was not a lawful order, and that I must  therefore decline to acquiesce. I reminded them that as a watchstander, I represented Commodore, Submarine Squadron 6 &amp; 8, and in this position, I held the authority. At that point, a contractor rolled up in a van. I locked the personnel turnstile, to address the vehicle requesting access to the pier. When the van was allowed access to the pier, and start driving away, and I was closing the vehicle gate,  the CNO came walking up. I gestured him towards the personnel turnstile, saluted, and requested his ID. He presented his ID, asked me where I was from, how long I'd been in the navy, etc - the normal friendly small talk you'd get from any flag officer. I returned his ID, saluted, and wished him a good day, ignoring the stink eye from the LT's. About 10 minutes later my Chief of the Boat (COB, Command Master Chief) comes walking up. I expected to be speaking to someone, as I watched the CNO cross the bow of the MSP,  and I knew those LT's would try to stir something up. What I expected was the COB to chuckle, and say something like \"I heard you had a bit of drama with those LT's,\" or something like that, especially considering that the navy was well into the era of \"procedural compliance\" above all else...Oh no! The COB was there to chew my ass, have me relieved from watch, and disqualify me from standing watches. This was really bad for me, and for the whole duty section. All the Submarine duty sections were stretched really thin, due to all the extra security watches required post 9/11. We were already working a 24 hour duty day every 72 hours, and the navy also implemented mandatory sleep period requirements for watchstanders, which meant no duty sections had room to lose anyone. While I was pretty flabbergasted, our COB was part of the new generation of Senior Leadership Academy douchebags, so it wasn't entirely unexpected. After being relieved, I went back to the boat, and talked to my Chief and Department Head to no avail. Tried to talk to the COB, and managed to get yelled at some more, and score some extra duty on the weekend. The CNO was still there, so the CO and XO were not immediate options. I asked one of my buddies to standby for duty section requirements, and walked over to squadron HQ, and told the Squadron Duty Officer what just happened on the pier. He walked me over to the Commodores office, left me in the Yeomans office for a second, then called me in. The Commodore listened to what happened, then sent me back out to his YN to have a seat. About 15 minutes later, in walks my CO, XO, COB, and the Navigator (NAV, my dept head)...I think the COB is the only one who really knew what was going on. The COB noticed me in the YNs office and gave me a nice look, just before we were all ushered in to see the Commodore. The Commodore was impressively proficient at chewing ass, and he did it all in front of me. When he was done, he verified with the COB that all qualifications were as they were before the incident. The Commodore then asked if all was well with me...Looking at the COB, I suggested that I may have won this battle, but with 2 years still left on the boat, I was sure to pull every crap job. The Commodore shook my hand, passing one of his squadron coins. He then wrote his personal cell number on one of his business cards, and said if I ever felt mistreated on the boat, I was to call him immediately. When we left, I walked out with the NAV, over to McD's for a coke, and to talk about what happened. The CO, XO, and COB left together, and I heard the CO yell at the COB \"what the f- was that shit show all about?!\" At McD's the NAV told me that the senior officers were in the wardrobe, having coffee with the CNO, and had to cut it short, when the YN informed the CO that he, the XO, NAV, and COB were needed at squadron on an urgent matter. When the CNO heard that, he said \"well I've taken up enough of your time\" and ended their chat.\nThe MSP was a horrible boat the whole time I was there...4 suicides and a 5th attempt, in the 4 years I was there. Several people in leadership roles were fired during that 4 years, including the COB in this story, and his predecessor.\nTLDR: I complied with the rules, got in trouble for it, got out of trouble a short time later, getting the person who caused the trouble, into trouble.",

        "text": "Not sure if this qualifies. I used to work at an internationally known pizza establishment (think a big old rectangle and pips) right out of high school. At some point they did a complete overhaul and added fun new features like pizza tracking and being able to rate/review/and comment on your order online (so long as you ordered online). Each shift the manager on duty was tasked with going through the reviews and following up with any of the negative comments that came in during their shift.\n\nOne night I was cleaning the line when I hear my GM burst into laughter. Being the curious scamp I am, I went to see what he was laughing at. He points to the screen, rolling away from the desk to give me room to read the comment section on an order from earlier in the day (before either of us had arrived).\n\nThe opening manager (who was the GM's little brother) was...interesting to say the least. I don't think he really liked his job (who does when you work in the fast food industry) so he really didn't care if customers complained. As such, he had a tendency to follow orders to an extreme. This is where the malicious compliance comes in.\n\nIf a customer asked for light onion, you were lucky to find three pieces of onion on the entire pizza. \n\nIf you asked for extra? I really hope you like whatever topping you asked for extra of, because you're gonna get it.\n\nThe customer from earlier in the day had ordered a BBQ chicken pizza and asked for extra chicken... It has been almost 10 years and I still remember the feedback he left in the customer comment section verbatim.\n\n\"I know I ordered extra chicken, but I wasn't expecting the whole fucking bird on my pizza.\"",

        "text": "13 years ago, me, my husband and my then 3-year old son were traveling by plane to visit some family for Christmas.  I had booked the tickets though a 3rd party vendor like Expedia or Kayak, instead of through the airline directly. When I booked, I selected seat assignments (this is before the airlines charged for that) and entered the names and birthdays of my family, as required.\n\nThe first flight went as fine as it can go traveling with a toddler.  But before we landed, I was looking at the boarding passes for the second flight and noticed that we weren't seated in the seats I picked.  Instead we were in 3 separate parts of the plane - something like seats 17A, 24C and 28B. So when we landed I went to talk to the nearest gate agent and after I handed her the boarding passes, the conversation went something like this:\n\n\"Excuse me, there's an issue with our seats.  These aren't the seats I select....\"\n\nGate agent cutting me off in a very unfriendly tone, \"Well you shouldn't have booked with a 3rd party vendor.  You should have booked with the airline directly.  The airline doesn't have to honor the seat assignments.\"\n\n\"Yes, but there's going to be a problem because...\"\n\nCutting me off again, \"Well I can't do anything about it.  You're just going to have to sit in the seats we assigned you.\"\n\n\"But you see...\"\n\n\"I can't help you.  It's just a one-hour flight. You can sit in your assigned seats.\"\n\nMe in a super, over-the-top friendly voice with only the slightest hint of snark, \"Sure, no problem.  We can sit separately. It's going to be a really interesting flight for everyone on the plane with my 3-year old sitting by himself, surrounded by strangers.\" And I turned to walk away.\n\nIn a panicked voice, \"Ma'am....ma'am...can you come back to the desk please.\" And amazingly she found two seats next to each other in about five seconds after that.  Thus the sanity of an entire flight of people was saved from hearing a toddler meltdown.",

        "text": "Its been a while (more than 40 years in fact) and I debated if that is something the folks here would enjoy, but then, what the heck, maybe some of the folks enjoy it.\n\nBackground: You have to know that in Austria, where I spent the first couple of decades of my life everybody had to serve in the military. And when I say everybody, I really meant that. Sure if you were missing a leg or something along the line you'd be excused, but short of that, everybody. This means even folks of ... well, let's say a little bit wider stature.\n\nThis is clash number one:\n\nSo, here I am a grunt in basic training. On multiple occasions we were told that we absolutely had to follow the order of a superior officer without questioning unless it's an illegal order, and even then refusing an order could get you in serious trouble. \n\nEven back then my mind was working a little bit different and sometimes faster, which earned me the ire of one drill officer. He was the mentioned a smidge wider man and he absolutely hated my guts and even more so he seemed to hate my guts. Back then I was still in decent shape not like the old fart I am these days, but I digress.\n\nThe barracks we were housed in were on an area of roughly 500m x 1km and he sent everybody running left and right, just normal basic training, but for some reason when we lined up again he felt it necessary to start harking on how I was too slow and I have to go faster make bigger steps or whatever. And to make a point he ordered me to run to sidewall and return. Since we were standing in front of the build we were housed in we were about in the center so roughly 250m from the side walls and about 950m from the end of the long rectangle. \n\nWhen I returned into the line there was another diatribe as to why it took me so long and to make an even better point he ordered me to run to the far wall. The Problem though was in the choice of his words: \"u/Diesel you run to the far wall as fast as you can\" \n\nI immediately saw my chance for the MC: A quiet salute later and I was on my way, really as fast as I could. and I followed the command to the letter. I ran to the wall, then stood there with my face towards the wall and waited. \n\nI knew quite well I would create a ruckus because I was standing face to the wall in front of the battalion commanders office. Who, very soon thereafter was standing behind me asking what the hell I was thinking I was doing. \"Sir, I was given an order to run here by Drill Officer X because I seemed to be too slow, Sir. Permission to continue follow that order?\"\n\nNow the battalion commander was very quick in grasping what was going on here and he gave me a second order: \"u/Diesel, good work: Turn back to the wall and wait until Drillsergant X comes and gets you\" A quick salut and a yes, Sir later I was again facing the wall laughing inside. \n\nSee if you read the order given by the battalion commander verbatim and that was how I heard it, I would not be allowed to move until Drillsergant X came to give me another order, and and I was under no obligation to have good ears to hear him hollering from afar.\n\nPredictably another soldier was sent to come and chew me out as well as telling to come back (everyone else was enjoying it because as long as he was busy with me he could not be an asshole to anybody else. I only heard after the fact when the soldiers that was sent to fetch me returned empty handed due to the order of Commander just how read his face got realising it would be him who would have to a sprint across the training ground and that it would be him to be the talk of the officers because a grunt had him. In addition I was standing face to the window of the battalion commanders officer and the laughter in there was constant. I really tried my best to stay serious, but it was hard.\n\nAt the end I did not even have to report to the battalion commander for \"Insubordination\". Suffice it to say Mr. Drillsergeant was very careful with his order in the weeks to follow.",

        "text": "I read an earlier post about a student using the rules of a professor and his testing rubric to the student’s advantage.  It reminded me of a different test where I used the rules to my advantage.\n\nYears ago I was a sergeant in an Army Reserve unit.  I was slated to go to drill sergeant school in a month or two and was tying up all the loose ends before going.  One of the loose ends was you had to have a fitness test within 2 or 3 months of starting the school (I don’t remember the exact time frame.). \n\nAlso important is how the school was run.  It was one weekend a month for something like a year.  Students were required to take a physical fitness test every other month AND HAD TO SHOW IMPROVEMENT.\n\nNormally,  I scored in the high 80’s to low 90’s on each event when testing for record.  Not this time.  Push ups - one over the minimum.  Sit ups - one over the minimum. Two mile run, I stopped about five feet from the finish line and ran the clock until it was ten seconds faster than the minimum time.  First sergeant asked me what the hell I was doing, said he knew I could score a lot better than that.\n\nI just looked at him and said I need to have room for improvement when I test at drill sergeant school and with these scores I have plenty of room.  Nothing he could say.  He just walked away shaking his head and complaining about attorneys (I was a practicing attorney in the civilian world at the time).",

Absolutely not my favourite task, but one that I can lighten up with a bit of music. I can't wear headphones because I need to pay attention to my surroundings, but ironing is static and I can plonk my phone on a shelf behind me.\n\nSo I turned my volume up, opened Spotify, and loaded up one of my favourites: _Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of the War of the Worlds_. An absolute classic of an album.\n\nCue the project manager scowling his way over to me, before _[The Eve of the War](https://youtu.be/5-3D8VitOkA)_ had even finished. \n\n\"Urgh, could you play something else? I don't care what, anything but musical theatre. Can't stand that shite.\"\n\nOkaaaay. It's not everyone's cup of tea, and I have other things in my library. Although a dislike of musical theatre rules out _Hamilton_ and _Wicked_, and probably Disney as well. And my assorted playlists are rife with tracks from all of the aforementioned.\n\nBut he did say _anything_ else. So I scrolled a bit further down my library and hit play on something I rarely listen to at work, even with headphones on, because people do tend to find it offensive.\n\nHe walked off as my phone started to blare out [something a bit heavier](https://youtu.be/gsHmOb36-Js). Of course I'd hit play on the whole album, and he happened to wander back a bit later as [this one](https://youtu.be/J-10ryvcE7w) was in full swing.\n\n\"You said _anything_.\"\n\nHe didn't look impressed by that either, and there was no complaint as I went back to my regular, musical theatre and Disney laden playlist instead. Not purely that, but not entirely profanity filled either.",

        "text": "  \n\nI thought about this one today and it made me smile, so I thought I’d share.\n\nMy first job out of high school was a big deal for me. It was a simple data entry job that I took very seriously. I started moving up very quickly. With so many young entry-level employees, turnaround was high, and I guess sticking around made me stand out.\n\nI was soaring in that company. Before I knew it, I was a supervisor over a team. In the department I was in, there was only one other supervisor. We worked very well together and agreed on almost everything. The two of us made a full training for our department, a department policy sheet, and conducted all direct employee contact.\n\nOur department was doing so well that our manager was recruited by another department for a much more lucrative role in the company.\n\nThe new manager was the nicest man alive, but as an outside hire, he didn’t know anything about how we ran things. At the same time as he was getting acquainted with us, the other supervisor went on maternity leave. I was the only lead in the department left that really knew what they were doing.\n\nIt sounds rough, but I blossomed under these circumstances. I helped find our new acting supervisor whom I’ll call Trevor. I went into all meetings with my manager to take notes and help him understand what we were discussing. I hired all the new staff members, from talking to the recruiter, conducting the interviews, and making the call to offer the position. I was running the show and I loved it.\n\nOur new manager was not really grasping things and told me he was thinking about leaving. I was sad to see him go. He then told me that he thought he would ask them to have me backfill his position. This would have been the opportunity of a lifetime.\n\nA week later, my manager told me that he talked to the director, but the position wasn’t going to me. It was going to the acting supervisor, Trevor. Apparently, this guy had been schmoozing while I had been working. I hadn’t even been paying attention to him. Trevor had become buddy-buddy with the director by spending all his time in his office and going drinking with him at the driving range.\n\nI was heartbroken, I wasn’t aiming for the job until my boss suggested it to me. I had gotten my hopes up only to be crushed.\n\nI tried to shake it off and get back to work.\n\nI oversaw department projects. I had one that required thousands of entries on an Excel sheet. I assigned our staff to the project and did my share. At the end of the day, I had gotten the sheets back from everyone directly under me, but nobody on Trevor’s team had emailed me theirs.\n\nI went to one of their desks and asked about the project. The person I asked shyly told me that Trevor told her not to do it. When I asked her why he would say that. she told me that he said I wasn’t her boss.\n\nI was shocked. This is how we had done every project since we had opened the department. What was he thinking telling people not to do it?\n\nI could explain the small ways that Trevor constantly was trying to undermine me, or the almost jealous behavior he displayed toward me, but this story is long enough.\n\nI'll just say, while shocking, it wasn't out of character for him. I had always been able to keep him from causing damage in the past and this didn't need to be any different.\n\nThen I realized what a golden opportunity this was. I decided to maliciously comply. I just nodded and thanked her for her help.\n\nThe next day, the director called the manager and supervisors into his office. He asked me why the project wasn’t completed the day before. I shrugged and told him I had sent it out to the team like I always do and had even done a chunk of it myself.\n\nI looked at Trevor. The look he gave me. He was pale and looked at me as if I was about to sentence him to death.\n\nWhen Trevor eventually tried to explain that he told the staff under him not to do it, the director asked everyone but Trevor to leave.\n\nThe project had been related to payroll and Trevor had royally screwed over the payroll staff. Our director was livid. He was in there for over an hour. I heard the director raise his voice more than once, which was wild.\n\nThe doors and office walls were glass, so when I passed the office a bit later, I saw Trevor with his head  down while our director was shaking his head and moving his hands in a very animated manner.\n\nA week later, the other supervisor returned, and Trevor was asked to return to his old position under her.\n\nI was offered the position of manager soon after, which I gladly accepted.",

        "text": "I was a rookie cop in the 90's in a big U.S. city.  I had an old salt veteran partner with over 20 years on the job, who was also a Vietnam veteran and gave no fucks.  We got a new Sergeant one day from another station, which was in a much more affluent area, who thought he was God's gift to law enforcement.  He got wind that when we were on graveyard shift, we checked all our businesses for burglaries or damage at least once a shift.  Our area had fewer businesses than usual, so it was possible if it wasn't too busy, but we ran a quick check before coming in even if it was 5am.  He didn't believe us and made some snarky comments about that, saying he'd rather have us out running traffic enforcement.  My partner told him \"no, if a business gets broken into overnight, I want to at least be the one that finds it and NOT the owner.\"  (which is true, but we also didn't really want to write a bunch of tickets in the early hours either).  Our Sergeant huffed about and didn't say anything else. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was one business where we had to physically get out of our car to check to see if it got hit.  They had a hidden side door that was a common target for burglars.  One night, I found a note stuck to that door \"District car, return this note to the station.\"  Obviously, the Sergeant was setting us up to see if we really checked all our businesses.  I told my partner and he said \"fuck this guy\" and snatched the note from me.  I told him we should go turn it over this Sgt. and he said \"no, I'll handle it and I'll take the heat.\"  We went back to the station, but didn't see the Sergeant.  My partner told me to wait in the locker room.  I was a rookie, so I obeyed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the Sgt. was getting off, we were down the street from the station, hidden and my partner watching with binoculars.  The Sgt. strutted to his car, secure in the knowledge that he had nailed us.  I asked my partner \"what did you do?\"  Turns out, he had superglued that note (which was on a manila envelope half) to the windshield of the Sergeant's personal vehicle.  We watched as he went back to the station to try to find something to scrape it off, which took quite some time.  I thought we'd get in trouble, but he never said anything to us ever again and mostly left us alone after that.  He also turned out to be a fairly decent supervisor after a while.   I'm retired now after a decade in the Army and nearly 30 years in law enforcement and the old war stories are all I have left, but this one fit this sub. Cheers!",

        "text": "Hey Guys, \n\nLong time here, first time posting.  \n\nMy grandparents own a lovely 3 star hotel in the UK, where I’ve work on and off since I was 15 years old. We have a very kind and genuinely appreciative client-base and don’t often run into entitled Karens, but when they appear all hell breaks loose.  \n\nThis happened 5 years ago so I will be paraphrasing, I’m sorry. \n\nAt the time, I (24F) had just been promoted to Breakfast Manager and was leading a small tight-knit team to deal with peak mid-morning rush. Our story starts when an older Australian couple staying with us sat down, and after an agonizing 10 second wait, the woman flagged me over to order.  \n\nHere’s the cast:  OP (me), Mike (the receptionist), Karen (Crazy Mushroom Lady) and PH (Poor Husband, but he doesn’t really affect the story)  \n\nOP: Good Morning, would you like any tea or coffee while you decide on your order? \n\nKaren: Coffee thank you. And we’re ready to order. \n\nOP: Wonderful! What can I – \n\nKaren: I am SEVERELY allergic to mushrooms, I want the English breakfast but without mushrooms! \n\nI’m taken slightly aback from, not only at how loudly and aggressively she was, but also because we have a spot on our booking form where patrons would signal any dietary restrictions or allergies and I hadn’t been briefed on the situation. \n\nOP: Oh, very well. Let me just go talk to the chef and see what we can safely do for you.  \n\nI first run up to the reception desk, Mike (30M) pulls out their booking form and, as suspected, the allergy section was left blank. Great. I then go into the kitchen knowing full well that our equipment wasn’t prepped for this safety concern. I knew that every vegetable was cooked I the same oven, tossed in the same oven trays with the same utensils. After the Head Chef confirms my fears, everything has been in potential contact with fiendish fungi, I go back to the dining room. \n\nOP: Hello again, I’m so sorry but we cannot serve you anything from the hot menu as we were not given any warning and haven’t got and specially sanitized utensils or pans to cook your meal safely. However, we will do everything possible to create a safe cooking environment from tomorrow morning onwards. We do offer an excellent Continental Breakfast in the meantime, would that be to your satisfaction? \n\nNow, a reasonable human being would appreciate even be relieved at our taking their condition so seriously, say thank you and go for the alternative instead, especially with a comped hot meal the next day. But she was a Karen… \n\nKaren: THIS IS RIDICULOUS! I have NEVER EVER been denied breakfast before! I don’t want your disgusting continental breakfast (we’ve won literal awards for it but sure…). I want my FULL English breakfast, just no mushrooms. It’s not difficult, they’ve done that in every other (large chain hotel brand.) \n\nAnd that’s when it hit me. \n\nShe lied. \n\nShe wasn’t allergic to anything, she just wanted to be the center of attention and she had put both of us in an impossible situation. Neither of us could admit/accuse of lying. No one could say, out loud, that she was a grown woman whose life was so dull she had to make up these little stories to add colour to her very beige existence…  \n\nCue Malicious Compliance. \n\nNow two things. I have BPD and all the OCD tendancies were just blooming back then. It thus makes me very nervous to deviate from protocol, especially safety ones. Secondly, allergy laws are very strict in the UK. We cannot just quickly wash a few pans and dishes and call it a day, it's a full deep clean of an entire section of the kitchen and therefore can't be done in a rush.\n\nOP: I’m so sorry ma’am but I cannot in good conscience allow you to take such a risk. With an allergy so grave, the kitchen and restaurant staff and I wouldn’t want anything to happen that could put your health or life at risk.  \n\nKaren: But –  \n\nThe never-ending pleasure of seeing the look change in her eyes when she realized that not only did she had lied herself into corner but also that I knew. A weird game of chicken then started, with her trying to talk her way out of her previous statement while not admitting she had lied and I, all concerns and attention, kept denying her request per protocol without letting my cover slip.  \n\nThe rest of the altercation is a blur of her shouting louder and louder at me, patrons turning around in shock at this grown woman having a temper tantrum over a situation that she CLEARLY created. Her Poor Husband looked like he wanted to melt into the floor. (I felt sorry for him, he was pretty timid and seemed very kind.) \n\nWhen she finally conceded defeat, she settled for the Continental Buffet and all seemed fine. I showered them both with attention and went above and beyond to smooth things over. When they left, both seemed happy, sigh… \n\nAn hour later, Mike (34M), my work BFF, came up to me with a huge grin on his face. \n\nMike: She’s back and wants to speak to the manager. \n\nI was the sole senior staff in the ENTIRE building at that time. She was about to complain about me, to me. \n\nOP: \\*Sigh\\* Fine, let’s go. \n\nKaren is pacing around the reception area, looking more furious than ever. As soon as she sees me she starts shouting again. \n\nKaren: I said I wanted to talk to the manager! \n\nOP: Good morning Mrs K. I am in fact the morning manager, what can I do for you?  \n\nKaren: Don’t lie to get out of trouble!  \n\nOP: I promise you, I am indeed the manager. (Mike nods, annoying Karen even more) \n\nKaren (sneering): You can’t be a manager, you’re a CHILD! \n\n(Note: I have always looked young, even now, and the uniform we wore made me look like a schoolgirl) \n\nOP (trying to stay professional): I promise you that I am indeed the shift manager. \n\nKaren: I want to talk to someone else. \n\nOP: I understand, however I am the sole senior member of staff at this hour, my colleague will be taking over for me in a couple of hours, I could arrange a meeting if you’d – \n\nKaren: No, I can’t wait that long. I can just complain to this young man here, he seems more responsible. \n\nMike: Oh, I’m just a receptionist, I am not allowed to process your complaint without a manager present. \n\nKaren: Fiiiiiiiiiine, but I want HIM to witness! (Pointing at Matt) \n\nThis isn’t the usual protocol but we weren’t busy so I agreed. She then immediately turns her back at me and addresses Mike, whose several ranks under me and was trying to keep a straight face.  \n\nSo there we were, stuck in this weird triangle where she’d be yelling her grievances at Mike, who was looking straight at me and neither answering or even looking at Karen, and I responding to her rather large and lumpy back. When she was done, there was a moment of silence with her looking expectantly at Mike, who was placidly smiling at her with the “dead inside” customer eyes. I then start giving her the usual complaint response speech. \n\nI will forever cherish the moment where she had to finally turn around and look at me. She was furious but I had her now. I told her that everything that we had done this morning was for her safety and kindly reminded her that that was the reason why we had a dietary recommendation section in the booking form.  \n\nThis is already miles too long so I’ll summarize the rest. I was able to calm the situation down, killing her with kindness and fake concern and she seemed AGAIN all smiles for the rest of the trip. I had started to pat myself on the shoulder when they left, but this wouldn’t be a crazy Karen story without the inevitable letter of complaint.  \n\nMy grandmother, the owner of the hotel, called me into her office one day. Terrified at being rebuked (she is a just but formidable woman. She can stare anyone down and win each time) She basically called me a stupid girl who didn’t know anything about customer service, how she had never ever been denied breakfast and had never needed to specify anything prior to sitting down (proving she was full of mushroomless shit.) It was truly a deranged letter, demanding I be fired etc… \n\nThe letter is now framed and still hanging in her office. \n\nTLDR: Karen pretends to be allergic to mushrooms for attention, ends up banning herself from cooked breakfast. ",

        "text": "Typically malicious compliance ends with the person telling the story \"winning\". I'm not sure that's what happened here.\n\nWhen I transferred to a new school in my high school years, I had to repeat a math class. On the first day I found that I could still get a high B or even an A if I didn't do any homework whatsoever. This was a huge oversight in the way the class was graded.\n\nSo I didn't do any homework whatsoever. Ever. And it turned into a thing. That went on. With a lot of this particular teacher yelling. It was not uncommon to hear this teacher yelling from another room. So this was maybe a good result for a rebellious teenager.\n\nThough after many detentions, I eventually found myself in what is described as \"infinite detention\". This means no matter what happens, you have detentions until the end of the school year. \n\nSo after school during detentions I would do homework and study. But very literally never do homework for this particular class. The benefit was that if I wasn't in detention, the likelihood of me actually getting my other homework done was slim. My parent didn't get home until late. So there was really no reason to be any place else other than at school preparing for the next day. And I did know this at the time.\n\nBut it does actually get worse. You can do things to help the school, prepare for events and such, that give you 3x the credit for detention. So I did this sometimes. According to the school, I was no longer on \"infinite detention\" status. But my 16 year old brain decided it still didn't want to do any homework for this class. So towards the end of the year I ended up getting more detentions. Enough that there were more detentions than school days.\n\nAnd the school itself insisted I serve them. So after classes were over and all the students went home for summer break, there I was at the school helping get things organized and such. And honestly I didn't mind. I really liked the school. I liked being there after hours and helping.\n\nI did get my B. And I never had that teacher again. Looking back, it's easy to see how trivial and watered down high school math really is and how stupidly time consuming history can be. So I'm glad I did what I did.",

He’s told me a few times to take the plaster and jewellery out but every time I explain that it’s too soon yet and I could get an infection from it he gets pissy.\n\nThursday I was supposed to close (Cleaning and putting the ingredients away when we stop taking orders) I put the plaster on before work so when I walked in you could see it. The manager stopped me “what’s that? I told you that’s not allowed” I shrugged and walked past him to get a hair net “if you don’t take that out I’m going to have to send you home” I was thinking of taking it out but I need to bave the whole with the proper cleaning solution which I didn’t have on me and I couldn’t be bothered to close that night. I decided to call my mam to pick me up.\n\nThe next day my co-workers were saying how furious he was when he realised I was gone lmao.\n\nBecause I need the money I do take it out but it still bleeds and hurts to put back in so rip.",

        "text": "Taking a class, the class is graded on 7 different projects of increasing difficulty then we have a final at the end. And your projects are worth 60% of your grade and final is worth 40%.\n\nThe policy is they will drop the lowest project grade to calculate your grade.\n\nIn the first 6 projects I got 5 perfect scores (100 out of 100) and my lowest grade was 85 out of 100 (this was the first project I had some mistakes which I learned from). The last project seemed particularly long and annoying and I'm quite busy with a lot of other things. I emailed the professor to clarify his grading policy and he tells me I still need to submit something otherwise the policy won't apply.\n\nSo I submit my project, and my project is literally just the title of the project, my name, a summary of the project, and that's it. Took me about 5 minutes...if that. I submit.\n\nHe tells me its incomplete, I tell him thats the project I'm submitting, he tells me I'm going get a really bad grade on this project I say that's fine. I looked at the grading rubric I should get 5 points. (we get 5 points for name/title).\n\nHe tells me I'm abusing his grading policy, I tell him its his grading policy. He tells me he's not going drop my lowest grade and instead of having a 97.5% project grade I'll have a 84.2% project grade.\n\nI go to his department chair, I CC him, I highlight the part in the syllabus where it clearly states lowest project grade will be dropped, I also attach the email of him confirming this policy and clearly stating something needs to be submitted to be graded for the policy to qualify. The chair responds and says that the policy outlined in the syllabus needs to be the policy that's followed and therefore when it comes time to calculating my final grade he needs to drop my lowest project grade...which in this case would be 5% grade.\n\nO I already thought about the final and how that might impact his grading of my final, but his final is going be multiple choice/auto graded final. \n\nThe malicious part is I obviously submitted subpar work knowing that the work would get a bad grade but it wouldn't matter because that grade would be dropped. Professor tried to back out, but department chair told him he needs to honor his grading policy.",

        "text": "**CONTEXT:**\n\nI worked front desk at an optical store for 2 years. I had no experience and knew nothing about eye health when I started. Over time, I learned to do contact lens training, how to work the machine for glaucoma testing (Visual Field Testing), how to adjust glasses and a little bit about sales. There was a fire and we had to relocate, which brought on a lot of stress to boss lady (we'll call her Mam). We ended up losing our tech who did the contact lens trainings and visual fields and our lead optician. Being the type of person who doesn't like to see others struggle, I always offered to help whenever I could- especially if the patient was nice.\n\nWhen we reopened, Mam's husband came to work at the office as manager, which at the time I thought was nice because I'm sure she needed the extra support (we'll call him Sir). He knew nothing about optical so he was also training while managing. The problems started on opening day with Sir and I. He wanted to play meditation music and forest sounds, everyone else wanted general pop and regular music. Since I had access to the speaker I would adjust it for them. He loved the new space, I missed the old space, but never spoke bad about the new one. If the office was busy and a pair of glasses needed to be adjusted, I'd offer to help and in front of the patient he'd yell \"do you know what you're doing?\" One time I turned to him and said \"I've been doing it longer than you,\" I'm sure he didn't like that lol. We had a meeting where he had no bad comments about my work but told me I make him want to leave lol. He would report every word and minor mistake I made to Mam, and she would send me random texts about them outside of work hours. I never got in trouble for anything but it was annoying af. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**STORY:**\n\nOn one particular day, I was doing mostly contact lenses trainings and a patient called about a contact lens being stuck in her eye. These were considered emergencies so I told her to come in and see the doctor (Mam). When the patient came in she looked really uncomfortable and asked how long until she's seen. Me being the helpful person I am, I offered to take a look until she could see the doctor. When I took her to the back I tried taking out the lens and couldn't find anything. I told her this, and she looked discouraged. I said to her \"I don't see or feel anything so you'd be better off waiting for the doctor, and that ain't me!\" She laughed it off, I told her I'd been doing trainings all day and was hoping to help her and apologized. She said it was okay and sat in the front. Apparently, she went into the room and Mam told her there were no contacts in her eyes. The patient said that the \"Nurse\" told her there's a lens in her eye and she wanted Mam to double check. Mam was really upset about this because she had to spend extra time explaining to the patient that I was nothing more than a receptionist. When she came out, she made sure to berate me in front of the patient and my coworkers. I just nodded. Even after work she pulled me aside to ask what I said to the patient and I told her every word. Still she felt the need to tell me that I make her job harder by misinforming patients. She said I should stay at a receptionist level and not help anymore because it causes trouble. I was shocked by how she spoke down to me and still believed that I told the patient I was a nurse and she had something in her eye, all I could muster up was \"Okay.\"\n\nAfter that day, I no longer did contact lens trainings, so now appointments are 4-5 weeks out instead of 1. I no longer assisted in visual field tests, I put them all on her schedule, now we don't have any availability for regular appointments until a month and a half later. I stopped offering to help opticians, so if 1 person was scheduled all patients will have to wait for that 1 person for all adjustments, orders and dispenses. That one had patient's up their asses with complaints lol. If anyone had a question about anything unrelated to front desk I couldn't help them. Even when she would ask, I just told her I didn't feel comfortable doing anything outside of reception anymore.  \n\nI eventually quit and now work somewhere with a much higher pay and benefits. They've lost a total of 5 out of 11 employees in the span of 1 year, and I heard 2 more are quitting before the end of the year.",

        "text": "Not sure if this belongs in AITA or petty revenge, but at the time it all happened, my exact thought was, \"If that's what you want, fine.\"\n\nMy parents both passed away in their house, requiring haz mat cleanup. The company showed up the morning after I called, which was great, and did the cleanup that day, which was also great. When I made the appointment, the technician suggested that homeowner's insurance may cover the work. I filed a claim and provided the info to the technician at the time of service. When he left, he asked for the $500 deductible, which I offered to pay by card but he requested I mail a check. The contract I signed was for a flat rate amount of under $10,000.   \n\n\nI assumed the guy knows how to write insurance estimates and claims and that he was going to get the max amount from the insurance company. Which was fine by me, he'd come out and cleaned up during a very stressful time, and I'm all about people being paid well for service. \n\nWork was performed on a Friday, the following Tuesday he called to ask where the check was, which I thought was odd. I had mailed it on Monday, told him as much, and saw later in the week it was cashed. \n\nFast forward two weeks and his secretary calls me to ask if I'd heard from the insurance company. I told her they had requested pictures which I had sent, and access to the property which I'd given them, but that was it. She then told me that because insurance was taking so long, she had no choice but to send me a Two Week Delinquent Payment notice. I basically told her, \"Fine, do what you have to do, I'll contact the insurance company\". \n\nI contacted the insurance adjuster and he was slow to respond. A few days later, I got an email from the secretary which cc'd the insurance guy, asking about her payment. In that chain, the adjuster finally responed and attached the claim, and indicated payment had been issued. \n\nSo, at this point, I had recieved the delinquent notice and read the contract. The contract was for a flat rate for X amount of dollars. Flat rate meaning, no matter the work, this was the bill. As I had suspected, the line item on the insurance claim was about $3,000 over the flat rate fee. \n\nCue malicious compliance. \n\nI wrote a check for the flat rate amount, mailed it with the delinquent notice and a request for a statement indicating the account was paid in full.  As well, in the email chain with the adjuster, I stated that I had received a delinquent notice from the service provider and had mailed a check. I also requested the insurance adjuster correct the line item to the flat rate amount and reimburse me, rather than issuing payment to the service provider. \n\nI really had no goal or intention of achieving anything other than, \"You want my delinquent payment? Fine here it is. Figure out how to navigate this now.\"\n\nThe insurance guy is a twit, and he never had a comment about the amount of payment or the delinquent notice. The service provider, they had some thoughts. I got a call from the service provider, and he told me that well, holy cow, the insurance company over paid them. How about that? He said he got my check but they had been paid already from the insurance company and they were going to mail my check back to me. This was really where I thought it was going to end. The service provider had requested and received payment from two entities (me and insurance), for conflicting amounts, the lower of which was a signed contract. A bit of a pickle to be in, but a pickle that they had created. \n\nBeing in this pickle, the provider told me that he was going to mail me a check for the overpayment portion from the insurance company. I hadn't been trying to get extra money, but I told him great, send it on over. My insurance correspondence continued because I waited two months for payment from them. I mentioned the reimbursement from the service provider, but as expected, I got no response from the insurance company. So I deposited the check into the estate account, and it will just end up being part of the dispersement for my parents' estate. \n\nThe day the guy came out to clean up, I had just expected him to get maximum payout from the insurance company, which was fine by me. But because they hassled me for delinquent payment (which I maliciously complied to) due to a lag in the insurance process, they ended up making almost 30% less. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI realize this got lengthy, so here's the **TLDR :**\n\nCompany sends me a delinquent notice instead of waiting for the insurance company to pay, I send said delinquent payment, company ends up making \\~$3000 less because I paid said delinquent notice.",

        "text": "TLDR at the bottom. It's a long read, might be boring but it's been nice typing this out.\n\nSeveral years ago, I used to work at an agency that hired us out as short-term temporary workers/contractors. These jobs pretty much consisted of stuff that company employees couldn't be bothered to do and so got someone in to sort out. It wasn't great, but I had to make ends meet.\n\nAnyway, one of these jobs was for 150 hours @ 5 weeks of \"office administration\". There wasn't much more information to go on, but a job's a job.\n\nThe office turned out to be quite a small, stuffy little building at the back of an industrial estate. I was told to report to \"Beryl\". When I turned up, I was met by a rather grumpy looking old lady having a cigarette by the front door. This was Beryl. Beryl didn't even say hello or ask me my name, but showed me in, pointed at an enormous pile of boxes full of paperwork, saying \"this all needs to be scanned in, there are two scanners connected to a computer there, off you go. Let someone know if you need help\". \n\nSo, off I went. ~~Fort kickass~~ that pile of boxes was to be my job for the next month and a bit. Joy.\n\nThe office was predominantly young men, with Beryl being the only other woman. She was in her 50s and spent more time smoking than working, and without being rude, clearly didn't look after herself. It was quite flattering to have a bunch of these guys pop by my workstation for a chat occasionally. \n\nAfter a few days of scanning, Beryl visited my cubicle. She wasn't happy that I spent too much time talking and not enough time working. I was confused - while I didn't have any metrics or targets, I was pretty consistently working through this mountain of paperwork. I got the impression that Beryl didn't like the attention I was getting. I pointed out to her that I haven't left my desk apart from to go to the toilet, if someone's over here to talk to me then that's fine, as I can talk and scan at the same time, like I'm doing right now. \n\nShe wasn't happy and turned away, calling out \"just do your job\" as she left. Some of the other guys had heard this and they popped by my desk later, and said not to worry. They'd had agency staff before and Beryl always hated it if a young woman arrived, because she was \"grumpy and jealous\" (not my words!). In fact a few years ago one young woman had left the office in tears because Beryl had tore her a new one for going for lunch with some of the other guys. Naturally this annoyed me, particularly because Beryl thought she could bully/disrespect agency staff, and I certainly wasn't going to leave the job because of an angry bitch. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Malicious compliance #1**: for the rest of my time there, I made sure to get dressed up. Make-up, curls, a midi office dress, stiletto heels. When Beryl saw me clicking my way down the office the next day, fully dressed up just to scan some paperwork, she scowled at me but didn't say anything. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next week, Beryl took some time out of her busy smoking schedule to visit me in my cubicle, the second time she'd done so since I'd started. Some of the paperwork I was scanning in had been stapled together, so I'd asked someone in the office for a staple remover and a stapler. I used to pull out the staple, scan the document, rename it on the computer, then re-staple it and put it back in the box. I was just pulling a staple out when Beryl walked by.\n\nBeryl's first words to me were \"what are you doing?\" I replied that this document was stapled, and if I put it in the machine it'd jam. She raised her voice slightly and said \"nobody told you to do that, just scan each page in seperately. Leave the papers alone.\" I could almost hear her eye roll as she walked away. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Malicious compliance #2:** so I did. Scanned everything with staples just folded over, and then created folders called Document 123, and each scan went in as \"123-page1.pdf\", \"123-page2.pdf\" - you get the idea. This slowed me down a lot but hey, it's what I was asked to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt some point Beryl walked by and saw me flipping pages like that. I'd put my hair in a bun and taken my heels off, and she smirked. She thought she'd flustered me and that I didn't see her reaction. Don't worry Beryl, you didn't, and I did. \n\nThe paperwork I was scanning in was boxed up as newest first, so as I got to some of the older papers, these had been moved around a couple of times and were slightly scrunched up or folded or similar. A jammed scanner wasn't an issue, it had happened a handful of times before, but as I got to the older papers, the jams became more frequent. It was easy to sort though, just open the back door of the scanner, roll the paper out, cancel the job and re-do it. At this point I'd gone back to unstapling and re-stapling because Beryl had given me some space thinking she'd broken me, and I just wanted to get the job done so I could leave.\n\nBeryl walked in one day. This would have been my 4th week there. She saw me un-jamming the scanner and flipped her top. She yelled, \"SML, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?\" (at this point all heads in the office turned to where we were). I calmly told her \"the scanner's jammed, I'm just pulling the paper out so I can re-scan it. Shouldn't take more than a few minutes.\"\n\nShe continued yelling, \"AT NO POINT WERE YOU INSTRUCTED TO PERFORM IT REPAIRS. WE HAVE SOMEONE FOR THAT. STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND GET SOMEONE TO HELP YOU. I ASKED YOU THIS WHEN YOU STARTED, WHY CAN'T YOU FOLLOW SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS?\"\n\nIt took a lot of patience not to argue back with her, which I thought was what she wanted, but I said \"okay, fine. Can I speak to the IT guy to sort this out?\"\n\nI couldn't have choreographed her response better. I then knew that she did want me to argue so she could kick me out, because she hesitated and said \"um, well the IT guy is off for the rest of the week (this was a Thursday). Ahem. Use the other scanner! If you jam it, let me know!\" and stormed off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Malicious compliance #3:** I knew her diary and knew she was off the next day (Friday). I carried on with the one scanner, making sure it didn't jam that day, and waited until the next morning. Coincidentally, the scanner jammed on the first piece of paper I fed into it. Who'd have thought?! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nObviously, I rang Beryl. She didn't answer her phone and as she wasn't in the office, I spent the day sat around without much to do. \n\nWhilst talking to the guys in the office, I learned that the company had been bought by a much larger IT firm and they just wanted the rights to the proprietary software that they had developed. It also turned out that the CEO of the small company basically paid himself into retirement and appointed Beryl as the director. Beryl knew that her days were numbered, so she was even more bitter to the staff. The guys working there had been committed various levels of careers within the new IT firm, which they were happy with. As I was told, \"120,000 employees. 30 dev roles are easy to find. 1 director role is not.\"\n\nAnyway, when we returned (on Monday), you could almost see the vein in her neck throbbing. She'd wasted an entire day of whatever her company paid my agency because little old me wasn't trusted to fix a paper jam. I used to get in a little later than the rest of the staff, agency perks woo!, but when I got in she'd had the \"IT champion\" perform the skilled job of opening a scanner and pulling a piece of paper out. She didn't even look at me when she said \"scanners are fixed, get on with your job and don't mess around.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point you may be thinking \"SML, this is a lot of text for some pretty trivial MC\". Well, you'll like the final part.\n\nMy last week there coincided with a new contract that the company had been given by their new owners. I assume it was some sort of litmus test. Whilst I don't pretend to understand what it was, the job involved a lot of scanning documents that had been hand-written. Hooray, more boxes! At the same time, a few of the guys who worked there were going on a visit to the new parent company, which were based in the USA (I live in the UK). The \"IT Champion\" was one of these guys who went.\n\nWhen the boxes were delivered to my cubicle, Beryl popped by and said \"these take priority. All of what I said to you is more important than ever. Do NOT mess around otherwise you're out of the door. Am I clear?\"\n\n\"Yes ma'am.\"\n\nThe paperwork delivered was from the USA. Our paper sizes are different. The first piece of paper I fed into the scanner jammed it - a safety lock, because it expected A4 and got US Letter instead. I \"jammed\" both scanners. Beryl, not being one to turn down a free trip to America, had gone with them. I rang her at 11am UK time, which was 5am their time. She picked up, and was not impressed. I felt sorry for the folks adjacent to her hotel room when she screamed down the phone \"YOU'VE DONE WHAT? HOW? WHY?\" (I tell her about the USA paperwork) \"CAN YOU NOT FIX IT?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Final malicious compliance:** \"No, you've told me many times that I can't fix these machines. What's the business continuity plan?\"\n\n\\[side note: my brother told me that phrase and he still doesn't quite understand why I turned up to his house a bit later with a few pizzas and a box of beer\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeryl had no idea what to do. She was clearly flustered. \"Can you just do what you can, we need this done.\"\n\n\"What would you want me to do?\"\n\n\"Can you fix the scanners because this is really important!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, you told me I can't do that. I need simple instructions to work with.\"\n\n\"JUST FIX IT!\"\n\n\"I'd be happy to show an IT specialist where the scanners are, if you can get them here to fi-\" (hangup tone)\n\nWell, that's that then. I spent the rest of the week chatting to my colleagues, updating my CV, and applying for jobs. Nobody turned up to fix the scanners.\n\nWhen my final week finished I said bye to the guys I'd worked with, wished them luck, and left with none of the \"critical\" paperwork scanned in. When Beryl got back from her \"business trip\" I learned that she'd spent one day at the parent company and left it to the other guys. When the shit hit the fan because nothing was being delivered, they wondered where she was. This was day 2 into the 5-day business trip - she was at a spa, phone switched off. She flew out early on day 5, without seeing any of her colleagues or the parent company.\n\nI kept in touch with a few of the guys afterwards. After this, the dev guys were transferred contracts to the larger IT firm. They all got a very small salary increase but were also able to work from home. This was pre-COVID so was a bit of a rarity back then.\n\nBeryl, meanwhile, didn't fare so well. She was initially offered redundancy (paid, including pension deals) but when someone complained that she'd not been present for the meetings, which I think was their \"IT champion\" they found out she'd been sightseeing, shopping, tanning and getting her hair done on company time. She ended up being fired. No bonus, no pension, nothing. \n\nI quit the agency not long afterwards and after one or two moves, ended up in a job I'm very happy with. The agency were none the wiser about any of this, they just wanted their money and aside from one initial checkup call, left me to it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR:\n\nAngry employee doesn't like agency worker, nitpicks and creates issues. Agency worker works to rule and causes a fracas. Angry employee thinks a business trip is a holiday and doesn't respond to messages. Angry employee gets fired",

The head of HR was also the head of facilities and according to herself, was \"the No. 2 in charge at the company\". \n\nWhere this became a problem was when it was decided to move 3 of my engineers from a small office they'd been using to turn it into a conference room. The challenge is that the goal was to move them over to an unused space in a much larger room.  Around 2-3 weeks, I'd scheduled time with the head of HR/Facilities to coordinate the move and asked to review the plans to ensure that they had both network and electric connections for the desks in the new locations.\n\nTwo things occurred:\n\n1. I was ordered out of the HR director's office for questioning her ability to plan.\n2. She went into the office with my devs and told them perfunctorily that they were going to be kicked out of their room in a couple weeks. This lead to my best engineer looking for and finding another job due to the extreme rudeness\n\nWell, I've done what I can as the team's manager. I've been ordered to stay out of it and let the experience HR director do her work. \n\nThe day of the move comes. The desks are all moved and the engineers discover that they have ONE power plug for the whole lot of them (which also couldn't be reached by 2 of their stations).  The network jacks had been installed but had been put in w/o anybody telling the actual IT team so they didn't connect to anything.\n\nI sent my team home until they had power at their desks.",

        "text": "Background context: planes are loaded with packages using a system called Unit Load Devices (ULD, can is the slang term).\n\n A load team for a can consists of a scanner who scans the package, a puller who pulls the package off the belt, and a loader who loads the package into the can. Under high volume situations, you can relocate the puller to a different can to help out.\n\nThe way the belt is set up at our joint is there is an east side, a West side, and the end is retain. \n\nWe are also understaffed.\n\nThe story:\n\nI work for an unspecified brown parcel delivery service in n unspecified state near Lake Tahoe at an unspecified airport. Our daily volume fluctuates between 6k-9k packages in our 3h+/-20min shift. Most of our volume comes later in the shift. Our boss has this idea that the coveyor belt needs to be crammed full to 105% at all times. The day of this incident was particularly high volume at the end of the shift, particularly within the last hour. The day started out normally enough, but quickly got well out of hand for our 6 people on the load team. The boxes were coming in stacked 3 high, 2 deep, so there was no way in hell that we would be able to scan them without stopping the belt. We have to stop the belt roughly every 10 seconds just to keep up with the ridiculous volume. Bossman (who likes to stand out in front of the forklift and yell at the unloaders to \"crank it out\") notices, and tells us to quit stopping the belt. One of our loaders has a genius idea: let's do it! So we no longer stop the belt by mutual agreement. Very quickly, everything slides all the way back to retain and starts falling off the belt everywhere. We, as loaders, dutifully keep pulling boxes off the belt, and very specifically not the floor. The bossman and his supervisors (and also the general manager, funny enough) are all standing in retain absolutely stressing about the volume and the boxes falling all over. When all was said and done, the east plane ended up taxiing late and bossman stopping bitching about us stopping the belt. He still hasn't stopped breathing down the neck of the unloaders though.",

        "text": "This malicious compliance occurred back around 2008 - 2009.\n\nI was in my early 20s and working at a Best Buy in the electronics department. I wasn't a Geek Squad member but I would help them out occasionally because I was very computer literate. Their workload was pretty large, so they needed all the help they could get.\n\nBack then Best Buy would do this thing to computers called \"optimization\" which was an extra charge for anyone purchasing a new unit. Essentially, the Geek Squad agents at the store would have to remove the bloatware and add in some Best Buy features to make the computer faster and more reliable. Bloatware does suck but we weren't supposed to say to the customers, \"You can remove whatever you want at home for free. You don't have to pay us or have to wait for your computer.\"\n\nWe were supposed to sell them optimization, insurance, extras, all that. Same old shtick.\n\nWell one day someone in the higher echelons of authority got the idea that we should have a quota for number of computers optimized. That way we would always have optimized versions ready, so people wouldn't have to wait. As in, \"You must optimize X number of computers every week so that we can tell corporate we've optimized a bunch of computers.\" \n\nNow at that point it was a little easier to optimize the computers because the Geek Squad would take the brand new computer to the back area out of customer view, hook the computer up to a remote connection, and let someone in India do all the work. In fact, we could sit there and watch them do the work right on the monitor.\n\nWe didn't know these workers. So we called them by their code name: Agent Johnny Utah.\n\nThere were several problems with the quota, the biggest of which was that we couldn't optimize every single computer in the store. We did have issues where customers wanted to buy a brand new computer and all we had left were optimized versions which they didn't want to pay an extra charge for. So we had to sell them the \"upgraded\" version for the regular price.\n\nThe other problem was that it still took time to go move the metal stairs to the back, grab a computer from inventory, unbox and set it up to remote access, double-check Johnny Utah's work, label it optimized, and return it to the shelf. To be running this process all day added a not small amount of labor.\n\nSo what did our team do?\n\nWell it was easy:\n\nOnce Agent Johnny Utah was done optimizing a computer, the Geek Squad member on duty reset that exact same computer to factory settings, and had him optimize it again. \n\nAnd again. \n\nAnd again. Ad infinitum.\n\nLiterally from open to close of business every day, some guy in India would be performing the same tweaks on the same computer, having his work erased, and then did it all again. \n\nI don't know how much the remote workers were paid and I don't know what they were really thinking at all. But someone, somewhere at one point probably \"optimized\" the exact same desktop computer maybe 50 times.\n\nTo my knowledge, the Geek Squad at our store was good about keeping at least a few optimized computers on the shelf, while reporting their quota as higher. And if a manager ever asked how it was going, they could always point to the computer in the back on the shelf being worked on remotely at any point in the day.\n\nIn classic fashion, no one in management really bothered to check their exact numbers and the Geek Squad could always use Johnny Utah as a reference that they had indeed made him optimize a lot of systems.\n\nThat job was honestly a massive dumpster fire and this was probably the least interesting thing to happen while I worked there but definitely the best example of malicious compliance by far.",

        "text": "A bit of context: I've been in the mortgage and related businesses for over 30 years. I know it very well. I've never like Bank of America especially their servicing division. This story happened a few years ago (just found out about this grouip).\n\nI refinanced my mortgage through a mortgage broker and, to my aggrevation, they sold the servicing rights to Bank of America (the entity that owns your lown is usally different than one that you pay to service the loan). I was miffed. I estimated that a Bank of America paid \\~$5k to service my loan as most folks at the time expect loans to stay on the books at least three years. \n\nAnother little fact: Mortgage services are paid 0.25% (fixed)-0.375% (Adjustable) of your outstand loan balance per year (it comes out of the interest you pay to the bank. If you want to know how much you servicer got any particular month using the formula ServicePay = Current Loan Balance \\* (0.25%/12) )\n\nAbout two months after the servicing switched, BoA announced they'd be charging a $5 fee for the convienence to pay the mortgage online. Truly an unwarranted money grab.\n\nI'm blessed that I can put a little extra towards my mortgage payment every month. So the following month, I took out my mortgage payment plus $400 in quarter from my local bank. I then went to my local Bank of America branch, and handed them my mortgage payment in quarters and repayment stub. I asked for a reciept of payment. I over paid my mortgage to reduce the current balance and thereby reducing Bank of America's fees.\n\nThe nice branch manager said you can write a check you don't have to pay in coins. I said I could but I would charge a $5 convencie fee  for the stamp, my check and ink used. The branch manager actually laughed and said ok. They counted the money and I got my receipt.\n\nNext month the charge was still there, so I went to another local Bank of America Branch which had gotten bad reviews on Yelp due to a hostile bank manager. I did the same thing. The Branch manager said \"Write a check. We don't accept quarters\". I said shall I call the local state's Banking Commissioner, the Consumer Financial Protection Board, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (US Top bank regulator) and say you won't accept legal tender? I asked to talk to the district manager. I was making a stink. After about 20 minutes, he grudgingly had the staff count the quarters and I got a reciept. I told the manager that I would be bringing dimes next time.\n\nThe next month I brought dimes. He accepted them but glared at me the whole time.\n\nAfter that payment, Bank of America resinded their convience fee.\n\nThe month after that I refinanced my mortgage at a lower rate. Bank of America only got roughly 6 months of fees for servicing they expected to last 3 years at minimum. Five years to be profitable.\n\nOne of my proudest malicious compliance momemnts.",

        "text": "I worked at a small market TV station.  It’s common to have fewer people doing the same job as you’d find in bigger markets, since smaller stations just can’t support the larger staffs.  For example, we often handled newscasts with just two people in the control room, with a director calling camera shots, operating the video switcher, and rolling tapes (this was about twenty-five years ago, we still used videotape), while the engineer ran audio, loaded tapes, and kept the program log.  It could get a little hairy.\n\nIt was common for the director to occasionally miss calling a command.  One day for the six PM news, the meteorologist teased the forecast going into the commercial break by saying something like “Will it snow tomorrow? I’ll let you know when we come back!”  The director rolled the commercial reel, which had a three second preroll, so the meteorologist had to stand there and wait for the director to fade to black.  The director had multiple things happening at the same time and never called for the mic to be clipped, so I, the engineer, brought up the level of the bumper music (also not called) and clipped the mic.  Just then, for some odd reason, the meteorologist decided to add, “Stay tuned!” but because his mic was already off, he was just mouthing the words on camera.\n\nAfter the news was done, the meteorologist was a bit irritated.  The director reamed me out, pointing out he had not called for the mic to be clipped.  I noted how such calls were often missed, and he just as likely would have called for the mic to be clipped if he had been able to pay close enough attention.  I wasn’t faulting him, just noting that it happened to have been me that got fooled by the double tease.  \n\nHe wouldn’t have it.  “In the future, I want you to follow my calls to the letter.  Don’t clip a mic unless I call for you to clip a mic.”  I pointed out that this was going to result in a lot more errors, but he was insistent.  “It’s my responsibility.  If I call it wrong, I’ll take the blame.”  Okay, you got it, Mr. Director, Sir.\n\nLess than four hours later.  Ten PM news.   The director fails to call for mics to be clipped going into the break.  Since it was not up to him to call what level the mics were at, I brought them down to just above zero.  Still technically on, but for all intents and purposes inaudible.  I waited.  The speakers in the studio will automatically toggle off if a mic channel is open to prevent feedback, so after about ten seconds into the break, the camera crew softly called over their headsets that the mics were still on.  \n\nThe director, busy setting up for the next segment, said, “What?  Mr. Engineer, why didn’t you clip the mics?”  I calmly replied, “You haven’t called for the mics to be clipped.”  “Oh, okay,” came the distracted response.  The mics remained on.  After another ten seconds, the crew whispered, “The mics are still on!”  Director:  “Why haven’t you clipped the mics?!?!?”  Me:  “You haven’t called for the mics to be clipped.”  Director:  “CLIP THE GODDAM MICS!!!!”  I clipped the mics.\n\nAfter the block, he was seething.  “Just what kind of game do you think you’re playing?”  I just responded, “Just doing exactly what you insisted I do, less than four hours ago.  You swore to me that you’d take the blame for a missed call.  The aircheck tape that records the headset audio on one channel will bear me out that you failed to call for the mics to be clipped, not once, but twice.  Now, do you still want a robot, or someone who’ll think for themselves and occasionally make a mistake?”\n\nInstead of taking responsibility as he had promised, he tried to throw me under the bus.  I got called into the news VP’s office the next day.  I explained exactly what happened.  The VP shook his head.  “Jeezuz, whatcha gonna do with kids these days?”  We agreed that I was to go back to clipping a mic if a mic needed to be clipped, and if the director had a problem with that to see him.  Fortunately, the director quit shortly thereafter.",

So if there's one thing to know about me is that I always, ALWAYS, carried a notebook with me in my sling bag. Why? idk but it was important for me to always have a notebook at all times.\n\nSo I studied at a Catholic school and we'd have this mass every first friday of the month. One time the the class was bored and chatting with their own groups during the mass and i was doing the same. Our class president being the good student they are did everything to keep the class calm and quiet. So they made students switch seats with others to make them stop talking with their friends. Being the loud, talkative kid i was, i got switched a couple of times before she got tired and told me to sit at the back and she sat beside me to keep me in check.\n\nAnother thing about me is that I was the artsy kid who liked to draw, so i took out my notebook and a pencil and began drawing. The class president asked me to put it back in my bag and i did but took it out again after a while. She got tired of it quickly and asked me to hand the notebook to her. I was kinda bummed having to hand over my notebook but then i remembered i had a SECOND smaller notebook. I also had a pad of paper, some scratch paper from previous quizzes, and at least 2 ballpens and an extra pencil.\n\nSo i took the smaller notebook and continued drawing. This time she asked for both the pencil and the notebook so i handed it to her and pulled out my pad paper and the extra pencil. Let's just say she wasn't very happy but damn i held back giggles every time i pulled out another piece of paper. Eventually I ran out of paper. But that doesn't matter, I can just draw on my skin!\n\nAfter drawing on my skin she eventually got sick of it and asked me to hand her my entire bag. At least it was fun while it lasted. She gave everything back after the mass though and she didn't tell the teacher so i guess we were still good",

He even went as far to make a new rule that for \"professionalism reasons\" nicknames were no longer allowed and we all had to use correct Christian names at all times.  \n\nNow John had a small secret, he introduced himself as, and everyone called him John but his actual name was Bartholomew and he absolutely hated it! John was actually his second name.  \n\nI knew his secret so started to address him as Bartholomew and when he tried to pull me on it I of course replied that it was his real Christian name and that was the name on all the back office systems so I was just following his new rule. \n\nWithin a couple of days the entire pub and most of the customers all called him Bartholomew. After a complaint to head office his silly rule was rescinded and Bartholomew was told in no uncertain terms he had to correctly address my colleague by her preferred pronoun and name.  \n\nMost people returned to calling him John, but he would still get called Bartholomew multiple times a day by the customers :D",

        "text": " Upon reading the  *“You want all records faxed?? Ok then!”* post, it reminded of when I had to deal with audit this one time at work. This happened well over a decade ago and I am not going to get into any detail about what I do for my job, besides it’s changed dramatically from how it was done then as compared to how it's done now.\n\nAnyway, at this point in my job, I used to handle a lot of the retention work for my group. (Thankfully, this is no longer being done as we’re paperless.)  Boxing everything up (lots of paper, faxes, signed docs, etc.), sending it off to where it’s stored offsite. Each box usually held about 2 weeks’ worth of work, so you can imagine how much paperwork we had at the time. Like clockwork, every 2 years, audit decides they want to make sure everyone is doing their job properly, so we have to jump when they ask. \n\nNow at around this time I was getting close to having to take time off for a surgical procedure (neck fusion) that was supposed to keep me sidelined for a minimum of 6 weeks. Unfortunately, I still had to deal with their idiocy of looking for 1 page in a box they needed pulled from retention with an auditor present. This went on for 2 weeks before I was now just over a week away from going on my medical leave. Knowing this, I sent an email out to audit, CC’ing not only my boss, but his boss and his boss’ boss, to let me know exactly what they need so I can get it ordered before I’m off. It was all about CYA. I sent it 8 days before my final day before the leave…\n\nGot no response. So I follow up on the Tuesday before I leave. Again, no response. Wednesday I send one more, this one with a bit stronger wording to it. I finally got a response…. the response sent to me just before midnight. The response was only a few words: “Just send it all to us.”\n\nAll? To make sure, I verified that’s what they wanted and, lo and behold, I get back an immediate “YES!” response. Ok. Got it.  All it is.\n\nCue the malicious response.\n\nNormally I would’ve needed to just send a form by fax to get any boxes delivered. At me, we’d get 10 boxes sent back. However, under these circumstances, I called, told them what I needed, and was met with stunned silence. They asked if I was sure I wanted what I was asking. I told them I didn’t want them, audit did. They asked if I could please put in an email and send it as soon as possible. I did. I also CC’d all the appropriate people who were on the other email.\n\nLate that Friday, about 30 minutes before I was to leave, the boxes arrived. One of the gentlemen who was delivering them called me from the dock and asked where I wanted them to go. I said audit. Gave them the floor and the extension of the contact person.\n\n176 retention boxes were delivered to audit as they requested. They wanted them all, they got them all. So many boxes were delivered, that there was absolutely nowhere to put them in their area. They had to put them in hallways and people's cubicles. By that time I was gone and I had officially begun my leave. It wasn’t until I returned 8 weeks later that I found out the fall out.\n\nApparently audit wasn’t too happy. Lots of threats made, they wanted me to come back immediately, wanted me reprimanded, wanted me fired, etc., etc., etc.  My boss at the time was awesome and showed them the email where they said they said, “Just send it all to us.” Lead auditor tried to explain it away, but my boss pointed out that I had emailed numerous times and they could’ve amended their request at any time.\n\nIn the end they were forced to deal with it. My boss’ boss sent out a companywide memo saying that no one was to assist audit in going through the boxes as they had requested them. My first day back in the office I was met by stone silence from audit. I got one email about a week or so after my return asking me to return the boxes to retention, but my boss responded first. He made sure that audit had to handle it in sending everything back and he asked me to forward the form to them. After that, audit never asked for me to do anything for them over the years other than a clarification here and there. My only regret is I never got to see the look on the auditors’ faces when all the boxes started appearing.",
