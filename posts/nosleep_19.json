        "text": " \n\nI saw something that I shouldn't have seen. It was a hot summer day and I decided to explore the forest near my house. As I was walking, I came across an old abandoned house. I was curious and decided to check it out. The door was unlocked, so I walked inside.\n\nIt was dark and damp inside, and the air was filled with an eerie silence. The furniture was covered in a thick layer of dust and cobwebs, and the wallpaper was peeling off the walls. It was clear that no one had lived there in years. I decided to spend the night in the house, as it was getting late and I didn't want to risk getting lost in the forest.\n\nDuring the first night, I heard strange noises coming from outside the house. At first, I thought it was just an animal, but the sounds were too unusual. It sounded like something was scratching at the walls and whispering my name. I tried to ignore it and fell asleep, hoping it was just my imagination.\n\nBut the second night was worse. I had a nightmare that I was tied up to a bed and someone was performing experiments on me. I woke up in a cold sweat, feeling like I was being watched. The whispering and scratching sounds were even louder than the night before. I tried to convince myself that it was just the wind, but I knew it was something else.\n\nOn the third night, I decided to investigate. I followed the sounds more profoundly into the forest, until I reached a clearing. There, I saw a group of strange, shadowy figures dancing around a fire. They were chanting in an unknown language and I couldn't make out their faces. I watched in horror as they suddenly turned to face me, and I realized that they were not human.\n\nI ran back to the house, feeling like I was being followed. The next morning, there was a knock on my door. When I opened it, I saw four identical men in black suits standing there. Without a word, they came into the house and began to question me about what had happened while I was staying there. They asked if I had seen anything strange, and I denied it. But they knew that I was lying.\n\nBefore they left, they warned me never to come back to the forest, and that if I told anyone what I had seen, I would regret it. As I watched them disappear into the forest, I realized that I had stumbled upon something that was not meant to be seen by human eyes.\n\nAs I left the house and returned home, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was still following me. The whispering and scratching sound still haunted me, and I knew that I had seen something that I shouldn't have seen.\n\nSuddenly, strange things started happening in my life. I felt like I was being watched all the time, and I heard strange noises in my house at night. Objects moved on their own, and doors slammed shut without any explanation. I knew that the mysterious figures in the forest had somehow cursed me. One night, I woke up to find a note lying on my bedside table. It read: \"We told you not to talk. You have been warned.\" I realized that the men in black suits had somehow found a way into my home and were threatening me. I knew that I had to do something to lift the curse and protect myself. I went to a local shaman who specialized in spiritual cleansings. He performed a ritual to rid me of the curse but warned me that I had to leave the area and never return. The mysterious figures in the forest were too powerful, and they would stop at nothing to silence me. I left my home and moved far away, but the memory of what I had seen still haunted me. I knew that I had stumbled upon something otherworldly and that the price of discovery was too high. From that day on, I never ventured into the unknown, and I never spoke of what had happened to me. The fear of the unknown stayed with me, and I realized that some things are better left unseen.",

        "text": " The idea that the world was a flat disc is a belief that dates back to ancient times. Many ancient cultures, including the Greeks and the Egyptians, believed that the world was flat. This belief persisted for centuries, with some scholars continuing to argue that the world was flat as late as the 19th century.\n\nHowever, the scientific consensus has long been that the world is a globe. The evidence for this, they told us, was overwhelming, from the fact that we observe the stars and planets moving in a circular path in the night sky, to the fact that the Earth casts a round shadow on the Moon during a lunar eclipse.\n\nSo why did the idea that the world was a flat disc resurface in modern times? The most popular theory is that it is the result of a conspiracy theory that a group of powerful elites has been hiding the truth about the world's shape from the general public. While this theory is often linked to other conspiracy theories, such as the idea that the moon landing was faked, or that the Illuminati controlled the world, for me, this was the only theory I believed in.\n\nEveryone laughed at us, and the idea we conspiracy theorists had put forward. The thing is, we were right.\n\nAnd now we are almost extinct.\n\nI was part of a group of wealthy and well-connected flat-earthers, and we put in motion a plan 12 years ago to prove we were right. We believed that the governments had banded together to keep this reality from us, the people, using fake agencies such as NASA to create false images and, in essence, keep control over the population. We infiltrated sections of the Government, recruiting smart but influenceable college students that could eventually gain access to top-secret files on the flat earth, and then we set in motion the largest multi-Government hack known to man. We dumped terabytes worth of data onto every platform we could – photos, files, videos, expeditions –that all proved, for once and for all, that the earth was truly flat. For many in our circle, this was a welcome revelation. We saw it as proof of our long-held beliefs and felt vindicated. But for others, it was a nightmare. They realized that the flat world was surrounded by an endless void, a place of darkness and terror where nothing lived. Or so they thought.\n\nThe revelation that the world was not a globe, but instead a flat disc floating in the endless void of space, had a profound impact on people's understanding of the world around them. At first, many people tried to ignore this truth, dismissing it as a mere rumor or hoax. They were comfortable with their existing worldview and did not want to disrupt their daily lives.\n\nHowever, as the evidence of the flat world spread, and some Governments began acknowledging it while trying to move into damage control, a lot of people began to feel increasingly uneasy. They were faced with the realization that everything they thought they knew about the world was wrong, and this caused a great deal of cognitive dissonance. People began to question their own senses, wondering if they had been deceived all along.\n\nOur small group of Flat Earthers exploded in members, and together with everyday people who felt betrayed, we overthrew those who were elected into power worldwide. We pushed the narrative that the Governments had lied to us all along about this in an effort to control us all – and if they lied about this, then what else were they lying about?\n\nThe thing is, the Governments didn’t lie to control us. They lied to protect us.\n\nWith the Government’s control and monitoring of the edge of the world now in disbanded, we began to explore the edges of the flat world ourselves. As we ventured closer to the edge of the flat world, we could peer over the edge and stare into the void and would experience a profound sense of vertigo and disorientation. We could feel the vast expanse of space stretching out before us, and they would shudder at the thought of falling into the abyss.\n\nThen the creatures started coming up.\n\nWith no one protecting the edge, the creatures saw an opportunity to finally make their move. The creatures that inhabited the void were a force to be reckoned with. They were seemingly not of this world, nor were they creatures that could be classified in any known category.\n\nApproximately 8 feet tall when upright, the black, slimy creature was a sight to behold, and not in a good way. Their inky black body glistened with a slimy coating that seemed to reflect the very little light that managed to reach their surface. Their body was long and sinuous, with multiple tentacle-like appendages that writhed and twitched with a life of their own. Their eyes, if you could call them that, were mere slits in their head that glowed a sickly yellow-green, adding to their terrifying appearance.\n\nThe creatures were covered in sharp, needle-like teeth that lined their gaping maw and drool dripped from its mouth in thick, gooey ropes. You could hear them breathing, which was deep and labored, as though struggling to contain their excitement at the prospect of a meal.\n\nWorst of all, the creature's movements were eerily silent, making them even more menacing. It was as if they could move without creating any noise, making it impossible to track their movements. The darkness that surrounded them seemed to cling to them as if it were a part of them. This made them almost impossible to see until they were right upon you, and by then it was too late.\n\nThey began to emerge from the void, first in small numbers, and then in waves. Their hunger was insatiable, and they swept across the surface of the flat world, leaving nothing but devastation and destruction in their wake.\n\nWe fled in terror, scrambling to find shelter and safety from the rampaging beasts. The creatures were unstoppable, possessing strength and ferocity that were beyond anything that had been seen before. The world was thrown into chaos, as we struggled to survive amidst the carnage.\n\nAs the creatures continued to rampage across the flat world, their influence began to be felt in other ways. The world was plunged into a darkness that was both physical and metaphysical. The creatures had brought a darkness with them that seemed to infect everything they touched. Plants withered, animals died, and the air grew thick and oppressive.\n\nThe once-thriving communities that had dotted the landscape of the flat world were reduced to rubble and ruin. The creatures had destroyed everything in their path, leaving nothing but death and destruction in their wake. We began to realize that this was not just an attack on their world, but an attack on their very existence.\n\nAs the days turned into weeks, and the weeks into months, the creatures have continued to ravage our flat world. People began to band together, forming small groups and communities in an effort to survive, using short-wave radio to communicate with us and others. They shared what resources they had, and worked together to defend themselves against the relentless onslaught of the creatures.\n\nDespite their best efforts, however, the creatures seemed to be gaining the upper hand. They were relentless in their pursuit of destruction and seemed to have an almost supernatural ability to adapt and overcome any obstacle. It seemed that there was no hope for the flat world and that the creatures from the void would reign supreme forever.\n\nI don’t know how many people are left out there. The creatures have claimed the flat world for themselves, and it is now a place of darkness and terror. The truth about the world had brought nothing but destruction and death.\n\nI write this from a bunker in the Swedish Alps, as a record of our mistakes. in hope that one-day humankind will retake this world. I can hear the creatures burrowing through the rock walls, and know my time is almost up. It won’t be long until they breach our bunker and devour us like everything else.\n\nPlease, if you ever read this, don’t make the same mistake we made. We thought we were liberating the people of Earth, but all we did was end life as we know it. I’m sorry.",

        "text": "I was living in a small town in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by dense forests and winding roads that twisted through the hills. It was a quiet and peaceful place, or so I thought when I first moved there. But over time, I began to notice strange things happening around me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt first, it was just small things. I would hear noises in the night that I couldn't explain, like whispers and footsteps that sounded like they were coming from inside the house. But when I got up to check, there was never anyone there. I tried to shrug it off, telling myself that it was just my imagination playing tricks on me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut then the occurrences started to become more frequent and more disturbing. Objects in my house would move around on their own, as if someone was playing a cruel game of hide-and-seek with me. The lights would flicker and go out for no reason, leaving me alone in the dark with whatever was lurking in the shadows. And worst of all, I began to see things that couldn't possibly be real.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would catch glimpses of figures standing in the corners of my vision, their faces twisted into grotesque shapes that made my skin crawl. They would disappear as soon as I looked directly at them, leaving me with a sense of unease that I couldn't shake. Sometimes I would see them in the reflection of a mirror or a window, watching me with a cold and calculating gaze.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to talk to my neighbors about it, hoping that maybe they had experienced something similar. But they just looked at me with pitying eyes, like they knew something that I didn't. And when I tried to search for information online, I found nothing but dead ends and cryptic messages that only made me more paranoid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI began to feel like I was going insane. I couldn't sleep at night, and when I did manage to doze off, I was plagued by nightmares that felt all too real. In my dreams, I was being chased by shadowy figures through the forest, their fingers just barely grazing my skin as I ran.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut the worst was yet to come. One night, as I was lying in bed, I heard a voice calling out to me from somewhere in the darkness. It was a whisper, barely audible, but I could make out the words: \"Come find us.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy heart was pounding in my chest as I got out of bed and stumbled toward the door. I don't know what possessed me to do it, but I felt like I had no other choice. As I stepped out into the hallway, I saw that the world around me had changed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe walls were no longer made of plaster and paint, but of twisted, pulsating flesh. The floor was slick with blood and slime, and the air was thick with the stench of decay. In front of me stood a figure with no discernible features, its form shifting and warping as I looked at it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt spoke again, the same voice that had called to me from the darkness. \"Welcome to our world,\" it said, and then everything went black.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I woke up, I was lying in bed, drenched in sweat and shaking with fear. I wanted to scream, to run as far away from that place as I could, but I knew that I couldn't. There was something there, something waiting for me in the shadows, and I was too afraid to confront it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo instead, I sit here, typing these words, hoping that someone out there will believe me, that someone will understand what I'm going through. But I know that the moment I hit \"post,\" something will happen, something.",

        "text": "I have always gone for odd jobs, ever since I became unemployed. The jobs no one wants, the ones nobody can find anyone willing to do them. The offers by unstable people, who have a lot of money to throw away. That's how I found Miss Clark’s ad for a dog sitter. There was nothing particularly special about it, or even too odd unless you looked at the small message she leaves at the end. “There is only one stipulation to this job, there are a set of rules for taking care of Franklin, and I have surveillance cameras all over the property. Should a rule be broken, there will be no payout.” \n\nThat last part was what made me dial the phone number. That leads us up to this point, of me standing waiting at Miss Clark’s doorstep. \n\n“Hello my dear, you must be Noelle?” Miss Clark opened her door and said this with a bright smile. She was much older than I was expecting, about her late seventies. The main reason this was confusing to me was the breed of her dog. As she was opening the door I heard the telltale barking of a breed I know and love, and heard the scraping of nails on the floor. Within seconds, Franklin was also there to greet me. A 160 pounds eleven-month old mastiff and an elderly lady are definitely a pair to see. \n\n“Yes ma’am, that would be me.” I quickly returned her smile, and she ushered me in the door. \n\n“I am afraid I cannot give you the rundown of everything myself as I am in a rush my dear, but I have written you a list of everything you need to know for caring for my Franklin. My cell phone number is also there and should anything happen that doesn’t either have a rule, or a solution written occurs you can call anytime.” As she said this to me, I quickly sat down on the couch in her living room right next to the front door. \n\n“That’s alright ma’am, I will be sure to look it over right away.” I answered, playfully giving her a shoo motion with my hands. She smiled and had a look of relief before handing me the note, giving Franklin one last pat and barreling out the door. \n\nI looked over at him after she left, he was quite cute. He had a gorgeous brindle coat, pretty green eyes, and a goofy expression as he seemed to be trying to figure me out. I quickly opened the note to take a look at the contents of the list. \n\n1. *Franklin is to always be with you at all times. He must never leave the room that you are currently in, unless all doors and windows in the house are locked. Even then though, it is an unnecessary risk and Franklin will not want to be alone anyways.*\n\nStrange rule, albeit doable. Onto the next.\n\n1. *During the day you may let Franklin off leash. The yard is fenced in and you can see everywhere in it. At night though you must only have Franklin outside on a leash. You do not want him roaming when you cannot fully see him.* \n2. *Franklin is to sleep on the bed with you during the night, he wishes to protect those he trusts, and you want to be one of them.* \n3. *Franklin eats twice a day, his meals are already prepped as he eats a raw diet. He cannot have table scraps as these may upset his stomach. Any treats he can have are in the cabinet labeled with his name. Those he may have at any time.* \n4. *Franklin knows many tricks, feel free to figure out which ones to your hearts content.* \n5. *He is allowed on all of the furniture, you may invite him on with you at any time.* \n\nReading that I quickly invited him onto the couch, and he happily obliged. He gave me a quick sniff and then laid down at the end of the couch, putting his head onto my legs.\n\n1. *You may hear scratching at the door during the night, this is normal, do not go check what it is.* \n2. *Franklin sometimes reacts to the windows, best to keep the blinds closed to avoid this. Especially at night.* \n3. *Last but not least, keep everything locked up tight at all times. Franklin doesn’t appreciate unwanted guests.* \n\nAfter finally finishing the rules, all I could do was stare at the note. The rules were slightly unsettling, but they seemed easy enough to follow. I slowly got up to explore the house, as well as start locking everything up and closing the blinds. Strange requests, but the pay out for this job is worth the hassle. I could pay off my rent for the year if I choose to. It took me a solid hour to check every window and door to the outside. The house is enormous, but I still triple checked everything. After fixing everything, I decided it was time to head to the bedroom. The sun had just barely started to set, but I was getting bored in the living room and the master bedroom flat screen was a sight to behold. I quickly put Franklin on the leash and took him out in the yard for a quick potty break. He finished up quickly so we went inside the house. Making sure I locked the door behind me.\n\nI quickly decided that I would take a bath, especially once I saw the giant jacuzzi tub in her master bathroom. Strange jobs working for rich people really do have such nice perks. There was even a television in the bathroom. I quickly turned on the tub, waiting for it to heat up before setting it to fill. I turned my head to Franklin. He was just looking at me, sitting calmly and wagging his tail. I gathered up my change of clothes and a towel, closed him in with me and turned on the tv to relax. I will admit, having a dog in here with me was a bit strange at first, but I also wasn’t going to risk the money I was going to get tomorrow. The tub quickly filled up and I climbed right in, blasting the jets. I felt the instant relief on my muscles, and when Franklin goofily trotted over just spent the next 45 minutes relaxing and gently petting his head when he pushed it towards me. \n\nAfter the bath I headed into the bedroom and laid in bed, Franklin quickly joined me and it wasn’t long before we both fell asleep. \n\n12:06AM\n\nI felt a wet nose on my face, as well as it quickly being followed by the slap of a heavy paw. I figured Franklin would need to go out again, and I opened my eyes to see him staring at me and he letting out a soft whine. I slowly dragged myself out of the bed and grabbed his leash to take him outside. As I stepped out, I felt the sharp chill in the air. *Hopefully he makes this quick,* I thought to myself. As I was walking him across the yard I saw his hackles suddenly rising, and he bared his teeth at something only he could see in the dark of the night. \n\n“Franklin, come on, leave it and just go to the bathroom so we can get back to sleep.” As I said that, that was when Franklin suddenly lunged at the shadows. I felt my feet slip and before I knew it I was hitting the ground. My grip on the leash faltered and I let go of it as my face seemed to ricochet off the grass. It took me a few seconds to regain my composure and I realized I couldn’t see Franklin anymore. I spent an agonizing few minutes calling out his name and looking around the yard. It felt like an eternity before he finally came back into my line of sight. As soon as he did I grabbed his leash and ushered him into the house. \n\nThere it went, any shot of a payday I may get tomorrow. Hopefully she understands, I mean it was an accidental breach of the rules and we’re both completely okay. I locked the door behind me, sighing as I looked down at Franklin.\n\n“Buddy, you might've just cost me a fortune.” I told him. He just looked at me with a puzzled expression on his face. I laid back into bed, and Franklin climbed up with me. That brings us to now, of me just sitting here knowing that one mistake completely messed everything up. Franklin just sat with me, seeming to feel my frustration and keeping his distance towards the end of the bed. The scratching at the door has started now, but I find it strange she didn’t mention the barking coming along with it. Franklin just turned to look at me with his piercing blue eyes. I didn’t really peg him as a drooler, but right now as he’s looking at me it’s startling to pool onto the bed around him. Something is starting to feel off though, and I can’t help but wonder if the mistake I made might be a bigger one than I thought",

        "text": "I heard sirens for what had to be close to an hour. They just kept coming up and down my road. Now I live in a relatively small town. I say relatively because I'm also near Amish country and those towns are wicked small. However we are a railway hub so it's not like it's the middle of nowhere. Anyway, the amount of emergency sirens I was hearing this night concerned me. I sent out a text to my brother who lived further down the road where they were headed and he had no clue either. Some time goes by and I eventually head to bed.\n\nWhen I woke up the next morning it was on the local news. Several freight cars carrying hundreds of thousands of pounds of toxic vinyl chloride derailed less than 2 miles from me and were burning. Train derailments are pretty common and I saw the aftermath of one when I was younger only a few miles from my house. Knowing this I wasn't too heavily concerned. We didn't learn much that first day or the next really. On the third day our Governor told us we had to evacuate as they were going to detonate the derailed cars full of toxic chemicals and do a controlled burn. The older members of my family wanted to hear none of this. However when the police went door to door none of us really had a choice. My family own plenty of farm land within the county and we raise various livestock but primarily cattle, goats, and pheasants. It was very difficult for us to leave these animals but we did our best to make them comfortable in our prolonged absence. We drove about 20 miles out to our cousins and planned to send one person each day back home to check on the animals and head right back.\n\nThe next two days we saw videos of the burn and we were able to drive close enough to see the smoke  plumes. It really wasn't hard you could see it for miles. Now before during and after the whole controlled burning we really didn't hear or know anything at all about what was going on. Nobody was telling us what was specifically being burnt aside from the vinyl chloride (we now know it was various other poisonous chemicals). My family are big Fox news people and they just weren't covering it so they had no idea what was going on. It became plainly clear that it wasn't just Fox not covering this story, it was virtually every other news platform in the United States. 250,000 lbs of toxic chemical was being burnt in my backyard and it really didn't make much news at all. People seemed to be more concerned with the Chinese weather balloons at the time.\n\nThe lack of information started to cause a stir in members of my family. Primarily my brother who owns plenty of livestock of his own. We started hearing from friends and neighbors that their dogs were getting sick. Within 24 hours of the burning, one of our friends had lost 7 of his hens about 3 miles from the derailment. For the first two days my brother volunteered to go home and see to the animals. Both days he came back and said everything was fine but the smell was horrible and his eyes and throat were burning. \n\nOn the second day after the controlled burn started it began to die down. My brother and I went back to the farm to check on things but the road leading to our property was blocked off. We turned around and decided to cut through our neighbors farm whom we weren't on really good terms with but considering the circumstances we figured they wouldn't mind. Our neighbors own quite a lot of land. They've owned cattle in our town for about as long as anyone as lived there. It was a long loop around their fields to our place and we weren't really familiar with the land so we ended up getting lost. Farmland has lots of irrigation and our town is in a wetland so traversing through farmland can be tricky (especially when it isn't yours lol). We eventually found our way back to where one of our towns creeks runs and used that to get us back on track. We got to a steepish incline in one of the fields and as we got to the top we could see down below into gulley where the creek ran. Off to the side we saw some of our neighbors grazing cattle hanging out. We saw two walking together, a few others eating and 15-20 cattle laying in the grass. If I had been driving I would have simply kept going but my brother being the superior farm hand he is noticed something wrong. He pointed out to one of the groups of cows laying out in the grass. Within the group there was one struggling. It kept lifting up it's head and struggling as if it was stuck. We hopped out of the truck and went down to take a look. \n\nAs we walked closer to the cattle it became abundantly clear that none of them were moving. Not asleep, not breathing, just dead. We tried to tend to the struggle cow but it was gasping for air and was in pretty bad shape. Looking around it looked as if the cows had just dropped dead. Nothing had been eating away at their bodies. There were barely any flies and many of the bodies were still warm. The strangest thing of all was with 4 of the dead cows. I'm not a doctor and I've never seen it happen before but I'm fairly certain all 4 of these cows had prolapsed anuses. I don't know what else causes organs to come out of a cows asshole but I'm pretty sure that's what we saw.\n\nWe eventually called our neighbors who had also driven away from town and weren't planning on coming back until the Governor said it was okay. After hearing this they of course came to see the cows. After we called them we were pretty worried about our livestock so we hurried back to the truck and got to the farm. All of our livestock is kept inside for the majority of winter so we didn't need to go searching for any stray sheep. We went up and down our stalls checking our cows then our goats and they all seemed perfectly happy. We were glad to see everyone made it out okay but our next feathered friend worried us. Our family has raised pheasants for hunting for a very long time. Some of our pheasants are free range however this practice is extremely difficult so we raise most of them in open pens. We keep the pens a bit further down the road (0.5 miles closer to the controlled burn). We started walking through the woods leading to the pens and it didn't take long before we started finding dead birdies. It's not uncommon to see pheasant walking around our property. We've named plenty of older ones and some become like pets. Others remain feral it's quite random with pheasants, at least in my experience. One by one we started seeing them in the woods. We counted 5 before we reached the pens. Within the pens it was pretty grim. Lot's of dead birds and quite a few dead vermin as well surrounding the pen.\n\nIt was sad to see our birds in that kind of state. As weird as it sounds, pheasants mean a lot to me. After disposing of our lost friends we left the farm and went back to relative safety. About two days later the Governor announced it was perfectly fine to head back home. We waited a few extra days but I drove back to my house last night because the governor said it was okay. I've had a strange taste in my mouth ever since I woke up this morning. Earlier today I went down to the creek and counted at least 50 minnows turned up dead. There's also this strange purplish film on the top of the water but it must just be my contact prescription being out of date because the Governor says the water is safe. My dog started throwing up a few hours ago but I'm sure he's fine. I'll take him to the vet tomorrow and pick up some ibuprofen on the way home to help with this damn headache that just wont go away. \n\nIf you live down wind of East Palestine Ohio or Pittsburgh PA or down stream of the Ohio River or it's tributaries I'd warn you to please monitor your water consumption and don't go outside unless you have to. Then again, the Governor said it was safe so perhaps we should simply listen to his advice instead.",

        "text": "The sound of screaming played over and over in my head. I remember a time before the creatures, where the only thing to fear in the dark was other people. The real monsters were the creepy neighbor who invites you inside when you’re walking alone, that teacher you catch looking you up and down, the people that hide in alleyways waiting for the chance to jump out, the real monsters were people. There was nothing made up about it, although there's nothing made up now either. We just once thought these creatures were made up. When they first came about I called them hollowers, since their cries echo so loud it's as if they come from way deep within the creature rather than just the throat. The evening they were released I was sitting in the living room with my parents, just like any other one.\n\n“Jessie, how was school?” My mother asked, my family looking at me happily. Before I could reply, an emergency broadcast came over the television. \n\n“To the people of America this is not a drill, we are under attack. Packs of rabid dogs have been released all over the country. Get inside, keep quiet, go to a room with no windows and whatever you do, don’t open your doors. No matter who you hear, or who you think you hear, keep it closed.” \n\nWe all piled into my basement in response, as it was a room with no windows. \n\n“Seems ridiculous to do all this over a pack of dogs doesn’t it honey?” My mother asked, letting out a small nervous chuckle. My father looked at her angrily, at which she looked at the ground and went silent. We were told to stay quiet and my Dad believed this to be an emergency. I grabbed my ipod and put in my headphones but the only thing playing was the broadcast, although it had changed. \n\n“This is no foreign country! The government is lying to you, its our own experiment-”\n\nThe random voice cut off, and the broadcast went dead. That was the last time it went on air again. We all looked at each other in fear but tried to swallow it. *A lot of people think that saying those kinds of things is funny* is what my mind kept trying to tell me, but I didn’t believe it. That was when the noises started, it was like the howl of a wolf but more drawn out, more hollow, and louder, as if it was coming from all around us, and then the screaming started. In the houses around ours I heard blood curdling screams echoing inside them mixed with vicious snarling and growling. It went on like this for hours, they would find their way into one home then into the next and we all knew it was only a matter of time. We heard upstairs being trashed and then suddenly stop. After what felt like a long silent pause, someone began pounding on the door.\n\n“Oh god please let me in they are coming! Please I need your help!” A woman’s voice screamed helplessly through it. I looked at my parents and shook my head no, we were told not to open the doors for anyone. My mother stood up and began walking up the staircase. I watched her hand slowly turn the knob and felt my stomach drop. It was in that moment that it registered to me that we were in the basement, and she was knocking on our basement door meaning she had to get past the locked doors and windows. My mother opened the door and I watched as a large dog-like black creature jumped on top of her sending both of them down the staircase at once. My father ran at the creature and I knew then that I had a choice to make. I could either help them fight the hollower, which was futile, or I could run and try and get to safety. I looked at my mother, whose chest was now concave as blood poured out her mouth and decided. I took off running up the stairs with my feet pounding across the steps. Quickly I ran straight for the door, throwing myself behind the bush in front of the house. I was mostly hidden behind the bush and I prayed the creatures couldn’t smell me. The screams never seemed to stop, only to become quieter the darker my surroundings became.\n\nWhen dawn broke I was still awake, curled up in a ball as if it’d make my nightmare less of a reality. I wanted to convince myself it was all a dream. For about an hour I sat in the bush waiting to hear any noise at all. I believed the howls and screaming had stopped a long time before but I wasn’t sure what a long time ago was any more. When I felt it was safe I emerged from the bush to a bloodbath. The blood covered paw-prints on the ground showed that this was no nightmare. For a long period of time I would jump from house to house. At first I felt disgusted with myself for raiding the houses, but the more bloody piles of flesh I saw, the more I realized no one would miss the food. It had been awhile before I finally decided that I needed to see in my own house but eventually I decided to. I walked up to my front step and went to pull the door handle open, but the sound of engines stopped me dead in my tracks. When I turned around what seemed to be hundreds of army trucks rolled along the street. Relief flooded me at the sight of these, and I quickly ran towards the truck. The closest one to me stopped and a man got out. He was dressed in all white and when he approached me his eyes were so black and soulless I felt like he was tearing out my own. A small part of me felt as though I had been safer with the hollower. \n\n“Miss! Oh thank heavens we thought there were no survivors left in these parts. Please come with me, I’ll take you somewhere safe.” With these words the man grabbed my hand, pulling me from the porch to the back of the large truck. When I arrived to the truck a man inside grabbed my hand and pulled me up. I quickly took a seat and noticed that a few of the people were my school mates. The oldest child was a boy named Jason, he was seventeen and the youngest was a small seven year old girl named Jane. Something was off, and I knew it but this was my only shot at safety, and almost dying can make anyone paranoid. After several hours we finally made it to the army base, the man who took me to the car led me to the bunker. I learned his name was Commander Bogg, but he wanted us kids to just call him Bogg. I didn’t talk much, I felt no reason to and Bogg seemed to tire of this.\n\n“Well Jessie, I’m sure you’re tired, feel free to sleep and I’ll show you around tomorrow.” Bogg said before leaving my room. My eyes started to close and I felt my body slowly sinking into a blissful sleep. Before I could fully fall, I realized that Bogg knew my name. I had never once told him my name. I waited until all the lights seemed to be off, and got out of bed quietly trying to follow where I believed he went. I crept down a few hallways before coming to a sharp turn off and being able to hear voices.\n\n“She was amazing general. Experiment 256 mimicked a woman’s voice from outside of the door. While Jessie Nelson’s parents went straight for the door she stayed away from it. We see great potential in her. She obeys easily and simply wants to please. Her concern for her own well-being and ability to be logical will also be a great asset to the nation.” \n\nBogg began in reply, “Yes, I do believe I picked well when I chose her to take on. The experiments really did their job. The population has gone all the way down to 50% in the last month and the president has called the things back. If only we had been able to let her father survive, he created the creatures. Of course he wanted to stay home and ensure the safety of his family-” I couldn’t take it anymore and burst around the corner. \n\n“You’re a liar! You’re lying! My father would never create these things, he wouldn’t help you destroy the world!” I screamed. \n\n“Jessie, what are you doing out of bed? You really should have stayed where I told you to-” he walked closer to me, and with every step a grin spread across his face. \n\n“I wanted to help you. I wanted to make you my little project. I knew your Dad, he was a good man. I'm sorry to him for what I am about to do. Truly sorry.” Bogg’s hand quickly went towards his belt and I saw a flash of metal quickly in front of me. \n\n“You never know what hides in the shadows of even your own life, my dear.”\n\nA loud, quick shot was the last thing to be heard, followed by nothing but a never-ending silence",

        "text": " \n\nMy story begins last summer. We had just moved to a small town in South Carolina. \n\nMy father had just gotten a new job, the pay was very good, so obviously he took it. I was not happy about it, however my mother and my little brother were ecstatic. My brother was looking forward to meeting new kids in 5th grade and playing at the park across the street and my mother was looking forward to trips to the beach and exploring our little town. I hated our move though. I had spent my entire life at our previous house, all of my friends, family, and memories were made at our old house. There is no way I would have to finish high school here, it was unfair. \n\nMy parents tried anything they could to cheer me up but I was just too stubborn to entertain their attempts. One of their attempts involved us going out for a nice dinner in our small town. We arrived at the restaurant and ate our food, which I must admit was very tasty but that’s besides the point. We left the restaurant and began walking back to our car, on the way back there was a man that was approaching us who was clearly drunk and maybe even homeless. He was muttering to himself and as we got closer began shouting at us. He was going on about some nonsense about disrespecting him and looking at him the wrong way. It was very hard to tell what he was saying because he was clearly black out drunk. During the chaos of the situation he tried to backhand me, which I dodged easily because like I said, he was black out drunk. We ended up getting around the old drunk and getting to our car. Once we were driving back we began to discuss the situation. My dad took this opportunity to lecture me and my brother on the danger of alcohol and firmly told us to never touch it. \n\nWhile discussing the drunk, I brought up how he tried to backhand slap me, which is something I thought my parents had witnessed but it turns out they hadn’t. “What did he do?” my dad said. “He tried to backhand slap me when we were trying to leave.” I replied. My dad fell silent as he continued to drive. “He didn’t actually hit you, did he?” my mom asked. I assured my parents that he had not hit me, that he only tried to, however I dodged it because it was a pathetic attempt. My mom began to humor the situation, but my dad stayed silent. I looked at him from the back seat and he looked angry. We finally arrived at our house. My dad ordered all of us to go inside and stay inside, and that he would be back in a bit. We asked him what he was talking about but all he said was “I’ll be back in a little bit.” before putting the car into reverse and speeding back towards town. “That’s weird.” my mom said before her, my brother, and I walked inside. Around 4 hours later at about 1am, my dad pulled back up to the house and walked inside. I walked out of my room and greeted him. He looked extremely sketched out, and jittery. “Are you okay?’ I asked him. “Yeah yeah, I’m just a little tired, you go get some sleep kid, I need to go lay down for a bit.” I agreed and went into my room and quickly fell asleep. \n\nThe next morning the family sat down at the table for breakfast. “Honey, what were you doing out so late last night?” my mom asked my dad. “I had to go have a talk with that stupid bum that wanted to lay his hands on my son.” He said angrily. “Dad, he didn’t touch me, he was just some old drunk, you really didn’t have to do that.” I said to my dad. “Enough, son. It is taken care of, he learned his lesson.” my dad replied. No more words were spoken about that topic for the rest of the day.\n\nAll was fine for the next week, I had made a new friend, I was more familiar with the town, and while I was still upset about the move, things were starting to look more and more bright, until a series of events began. I had just gotten home from a walk around the block. I went into my room and opened my window to get some fresh air in, and that’s when I saw him. A man was standing in my neighbors yard, he was wearing a black hoodie, dirty blue jeans, and work boots. “That's odd” I thought. “It’s the middle of the summer, why is he wearing all of those clothes, he has to be burning up in those.” Just as I thought that he turned and walked off into the woods. I thought that was pretty odd, but I didn't think much of it and went on with my day.\n\nAbout 2 days later, me and the family were sitting at the table eating dinner, when I caught a glimpse of something at our kitchen window, I looked back and saw that out in the backyard, peeking over the fence, was a man in a black hoodie. My heart dropped and I quickly stood up. My dad looked at me confused and I explained that I saw someone peeking over the fence, looking at us. Me and my dad quickly rushed outside hoping to find the man, but he was long gone. We came back inside and sat down. I had forgotten about the events two days prior so I did not make the connection yet. “If you boys see anything else strange, let me know.” My dad told me and my brother before going into the other room to have a talk with my mother.\n\nThe next day, I was sitting in my room once again when I heard a whistling from outside my window. I peeked outside and noticed him. Across the street, sitting on one of the swings, was the same man I had seen. He was wearing the same black hoodie, same dirty blue jeans, same work boots. I quickly ran out of my room and told my dad. We walked outside, but when we did, there was nobody. Nobody was sitting on the swing, nobody was in sight. My dad told me that maybe I had just been daydreaming and didn’t actually see anybody. I sorta began to believe him. Maybe the stress of us moving was beginning to take a toll on my mind. So I just ignored it and continued on with my day.\n\nThere was not another incident for roughly 2 weeks until my brother began to get night terrors. He would continuously wake up in the middle of the night screaming. He claimed that there was a man in his closet. However every time my parents looked, they never found anyone. I began to get suspicious, why were me and my little brother getting these random dreams or hallucinations of a man. It didn’t make sense.\n\nLeading up to this point, all of these experiences have been pretty tame and explainable. Maybe I was daydreaming most of my experiences, and maybe my brother had been watching too many spooky movies and was getting nightmares from them, but roughly a month into our move, shit began to get real. I was sitting on my porch one day, trying to enjoy the weather when I saw him, the man in the hoodie walking down the middle of the road. He was walking directly towards me. I noticed him, and began thinking about confronting him. I knew by now, this was no daydream. I stood up and was about to begin walking towards him, when I felt it. My fight or flight kicked in. I was completely terrified. With every step this man took, I would feel more and more scared. I truly felt that if I had gotten any closer to this man I would 100% die. I had never been more scared in my entire life. I quickly turned around and bolted inside. I told my dad about the man and he walked outside. He came back in a minute later and told me there was nobody outside. Was I going crazy? I knew for a fact this man was there a second ago, where did he go? All these thoughts raced through my head. It was getting too much for me, so I went and laid down on my bed until dinner. \n\nOnce dinner was ready, I sat down at the table and began eating, not saying a word. All of a sudden, my dad quickly looked at the back door. The whole family looked up at him as he yelled “Holy shit !” as he stood up and sprinted to the bedroom. We all looked at each other confused as my mom yelled “Where are you going?” My dad yelled back “To get the gun, what do you think?” We all looked even more confused. “Why are you getting the gun?” My mom replied. “Because there is a man at our backdoor” he yelled as he came rushing back into the kitchen. “What the hell are you talking about?” Mom replied “there is nobody at the door?”. My dad flung open the backdoor and began patrolling our backyard. I came outside “Dad there was nobody at the door, what are you talking about?” I said. I looked him in the eye and he looked terrified. He rushed me back inside and locked the doors. He refused to talk about it again.\n\nThe next 2 months passed with the occasional sighting of the man in the black hoodie, most of the time however, he would be off very far in the distance, usually watching the house. I didn’t know what to do, I genuinely believed I was going crazy.\n\nOn the final Tuesday of summer break, before school started again, I sat in my room reading a book at approximately 10pm, when I heard a knock on my window. My heart dropped, I knew who it was. I looked at my window to see the man in the black hoodie. We seemed to stare at each other for what felt like an eternity. He began to reach up and grab his hoodie, he pulled it down to reveal his face. It was the old drunk man from the restaurant that had harassed me and my family, which felt like it was so long ago. He stood there looking at me with his cold, emotionless eyes. It all made sense. My dad more than likely found the old man, yelled at him or maybe even beat him up. Then when my dad left, the man had probably followed him home and stalked my family as a way of ‘revenge’. I hurriedly stood up and ran out of my room to tell my dad. When I got to the living room, I saw my dad sitting there with his head in his hands.\n\nI was going to tell him about the man at my window when I noticed what was on the TV. It was a news report about a dead body found in the woods a few miles from my house. “Breaking news, a 56 year old man, Charles Burlap was found dead in nearby woods a few hours ago. It is suspected the cause of death is murder. Police say the man has been deceased for an estimated 3 months, and are currently investigating further.” They then popped a picture of this man Charles onto the screen. It was him. The man at my window was the man that I was seeing on the TV. I didn’t have time to process what was happening, when it started. Knocking, on every possible surface. On every single window, door, and wall, there was loud, aggressive knocking. My dad quickly ran into the bedroom and grabbed his hunting rifle and headed outside.\n\nDad never came back inside. Police were only able to find his hunting rifle  2 miles into the woods. They called off the search not long after. I have no idea what happened to my dad. I have no idea what he did to that man the night that we were at the restaurant and to be honest, I’m not sure I want to know.  Ever since his disappearance however, I have not seen the man in the black hoodie. Everything has been very quiet recently. The only problem however is that my little brother has started to get night terrors again, and I often catch him waving out the window to somebody on the playground, that I can’t see.",

        "text": "I work at The Drowsy Spectre, a café positioned in a place sure to never get any business. No human business, that is. We haven't heard from Dan and none of us have taken the risk to summon John. But I did meet a sentient squishmallow. Things get a little weird here. If you want to get caught up, or start at the beginning, then go ahead and check[ this](https://www.reddit.com/user/AHauntedBarista/comments/z473tt/i_am_a_barista_that_serves_the_supernatural_find/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) out.\n\n\\--------------------------------------\n\nI've had the flu for the past week and a half. Never had it that bad, to be honest, and now I have to wonder if the void had something to do with that. I've got the worst tooth pain too. That isn't a usual symptom of the flu, is it? Regardless, besides a lingering cough and achy joints, I am better. I've got a few stories I need to tell, including some updates surrounding Laura. And a while ago I told you that someone was stealing my laptop, well we know who that was. I need to get on that, I know.\n\nBut I am sure all of you are more curious about what unfolded when the shop went into the void. Var'lovya, Selene called it. I left everyone on a cliffhanger that I intended on finishing immediately after, but being sick wrecked me. Fortunately I have a good memory when it comes to these things, however, so I should be able to recall most of it.\n\nWhere did I leave off? I think Barrow had his gun aimed at Maggie and Bilgoth. Turns out Evangel was dead, but I have no idea how long. I imagine it was the real her at the meeting, certainly Bilgoth couldn't fake that, was the goblin working with us the entire time since then? I guess it doesn't really matter. It is like Barrow said; we have a high turnover rate. I just hope I am not the next unfortunate missing person.\n\nSo Bilgoth and Maggie were fighting.\n\n\"No.\" Barrow moved the gun in Maggie's direction. \"No one moves.\"\n\n\"What?\" Maggie froze. \"He's a monster, for Christ's sake! Shoot *him,* not me!\"\n\nSelene stepped towards Barrow. \"Hook, what are you doing?\"\n\n\"I am a person, that is a monster! Are you crazy?!\" Maggie crouched, as if to make herself a smaller target. \"Don't shoot me!\"\n\n\"Barrow, it is Bilgoth.\" I tried. \"He's worn two of our coworkers. I think it is fair to shoot him.\" Honestly, it seemed more than fair. If someone came over to your house wearing the skin of your best friend, you might agree.\n\nA click drew our attention, we all turned to see the front door open. Em stared out into the endless expanse. \"We must clean the forest.\" She mumbled. Her foot went up.\n\n\"Em!\" I shouted, but her attention was on the infinite nothing.\n\n\"My father calls me.\"\n\n\"He's not out there, Em.\" Trying to split his attention, Barrow spoke as he faced Bilgoth and Maggie. \"It isn't real.\"\n\n\"The forest is his.\" She took a step. \"We must all pay our due.\"\n\nUnlike the rest of us, Selene went into action. She grabbed Em's wrist before she could take another step. The action surprised Barrow, whose finger was ever so close to pulling the trigger. A shot rang off, Barrow dropped the gun in response. He also dropped the flashlight so that it faced outside, providing little to no light on the rest of the shop. A terrible squeal, followed by an ear-piercing scream, had me backed into a corner with my hands over my ears. I couldn't see anything!\n\nI grabbed the flashlight while Barrow fumbled in the dark for the gun. As it turned out, having little to no emotion did not stop one from being startled. Finally we had the room lit again. Maggie and Bilgoth were gone, a long trail of blood led towards a wall and up towards the ceiling tiles. The goblin got her, it would seem. So much for not murdering people. That meant the only people left were Selene, Em, Barrow, and myself.\n\nThat wasn't right. Jack and Rick were nowhere to be seen. Before I had gone to bed, they were there with us. I didn't see any blood to suggest they were killed. Every other incident had a red trail to follow. Had they walked out the front door, just as Em was about to do? Had we not been there to save them?\n\nNoting the blood trail, Barrow sighed. \"Did I shoot one of them?\"\n\n\"Somebody made sure it was too dark to tell!\" Selene snapped when the silence was broken. \"Christ's sake, Hook! Get a grip!\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" He held out the gun. \"Maybe it is best for someone else to have this?\"\n\nEm, having shaken off whatever influence was upon her thanks to Selene, reached out.\n\n\"Absolutely not.\" Selene stopped her. \"Seeing as I know this place best, I'll take it.\"\n\nBut she didn't need a gun. \"Don't you have magic you could use or something?\"\n\n\"You saw what happened last time I tried that. No, I think a gun would work best.\" She lifted a hand. \"And no, I am not playing twenty questions to explain why that happens. Maybe if we get out of this, but not now.\"\n\nWell that meant that I wasn't going to be able to distract myself as easily. I mean, we weren't going to go hunting down Bilgoth or anything. At least, that is what I thought. I was wrong.\n\n\"We should go find the goblin.\" Selene proposed.\n\nBarrow shook his head. \"That sounds like a bad idea.\"\n\n\"Walking away from this spot seems to get people killed. Jack and Rick are gone too. The only people that are alive are the ones that stayed put.\" That was how I viewed it, at least.\n\nThat was when Selene finally noticed their absence. \"Where are those two?\"\n\nI noticed Em was looking out the window again. \"Hey, don't.\"\n\nIt seemed a great effort to pull herself from it. \"Sorry. There is something out there.\"\n\n\"It isn't your father.\"\n\n\"Yeah... yeah, I know. But something is calling me. Us.\"\n\n\"We don't need to listen. We don't need to answer.\"\n\n\"Seriously, where did those two guys go?\" Selene asked again, prompting me to sweep the store with the powerful flashlight. \"Did the goblin pick them off?\"\n\nI spotted a bit of light coming from near Selene's office. It would help if I explained the layout a bit better to you all; in the second room of the Drowsy Spectre, at the back end, is a little hallway with a bathroom. To the left is a little break room with boxes for us to put our stuff. To the right is Selene's office, which is rather sizable. I guess it wasn't designed super well because the walls don't reach the ceiling fully, as if the office was an afterthought and whoever made it didn't feel like tearing into the ceiling. I could see what looked like a weak flashlight peaking over the top of the office; there was someone inside.\n\n\"Is someone in your office?\" I asked before I recalled one of the shop's rules. \"And aren't the lights out?\"\n\n\"Shit.\" Selene muttered, glancing nervously at Barrow. \"We can't turn the light back on.\"\n\n\"They have a flashlight. It might be enough.\"\n\n\"If it turns off their phones, they won't be able to get them back on fast enough. They can't be in there!\" Gun in hand, she moved towards her office.\n\nWe turned the lights on just fine before just fine. \"Can't we just put the flashlight in there, then we can turn it on if it turns off?\" It should have the same effect as the light.\n\n\"The light is protected from electrical surges.\" Barrow answered as we followed Selene. \"It survives the surge. Any other electronics won't, Selene was able to protect the light because the switch is outside.\"\n\nSelene held up her gun as we entered the short hallway. \"You hear that? If that light goes out, and it will, then you'll die! Get out of there!\" No answer, but it was clear Selene didn't want to go inside. \"Get out!\"\n\n\"Not a chance.\" Rick answered. \"This is the safest place in the building and if you try something stupid I'll make this guy hurt!\"\n\nThere was a thump. \"Don't come in! He has a gun!\"\n\nA gun?! Where did he find a gun?! \"Jack?\"\n\n\"We're all going to stay quiet now.\" Rick demanded. \"Heard that gunshot, all the screaming too. I don't trust anyone. We wait for the sun to come back and we all pretend this didn't happen or someone is going to die.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is you! That room is cursed, you cannot be in there!\" She tried. \"If that-\"\n\n\"What do you think I am? A child?! Get away from the door and find a corner you like. I'll not hurt anyone if we all mind our own business.\"\n\nWe needed to know how much time they had. \"How often do the lights go out?\"\n\n\"It isn't set like that. There is no way to tell. They could have seconds.\"\n\n\"We have all the time we need!\" Rick shouted back. \"Get away from the fucking door or I'll start shooting!\"\n\nWe didn't have a choice but to oblige. I was more concerned about Jack than the armed maniac, if it were just the latter then I'd let the lights go out without concern. As we returned to the lobby, I could see the gears in Selene's head turning. She was fighting for a solution but it was clear that nothing was coming to her.\n\nShe put her hands on the front counter. \"We have to figure out something!\"\n\n\"Maybe we can trade Jack? There has to be something Rick will give him up for.\"\n\n\"No!\" She snapped. \"That isn't it! If that light goes out and they are in there too long, they are screwed, but it isn't just them. It is my curse and it will come for me too!\"\n\nCurse? \"What aren't you telling me?\"\n\n\"Need to know.\" Selene sighed. \"You know, it would only make everything worse. Just focus on not getting yourself killed, little bird.\"\n\nWhat? \"Little bird?\"\n\nSelene turned red. \"Yeah, I can't use your name.\"\n\nWhy was she so red? \"Oh. I like it.\"\n\n\\--------------------------------------\n\nHours went by I think. It is really hard to tell with the complete lack of a sky, or any light. I started to get a headache around then, whether from the intense darkness or the constant white light from Barrow's flashlight, I do not know. We were sitting in the same spot we had before, wanting to keep away from the old man's corpse but also have sightlines on Selene's office. We checked on them once, but Rick made it clear any more disturbances would result in Jack's harm as he struck him with enough force to cause a yelp.\n\nObviously I wasn't going to try sleeping again. That was a mistake and I wasn't really tired. Exhausted? Sure, but there is a certain kind of exhaustion that refuses sleep. Terror helped with that too. No, I wouldn't be sleeping for a while even if it were safe to do so. So I watched the office, the ceiling tiles, and despite knowing it was a bad idea, I looked into the darkness outside the windows. There was no monster made of teeth, no voice that called out, nothing but an infinite abyss deep in which I knew something was staring back. Something familiar, but there was no way of knowing what. I would have to go out there, into the darkness, and swim in a void to find out. It was tempting me to do that, but it was far from worth trying.\n\nI was starting to feel a bit warm. The doll must have solved my wish and it was looking for another one. Typically it could come to me by some secret power, finding itself in my coat or among my things of its own accord. It couldn't come to the void and the fiery curse that ensured I kept on wishing seemed much slower to affect me.\n\nThere was no telling how long we would be there, however, so I scooted close to Barrow. \"Hey, can I ask a question?\"\n\nHe had chosen to sit alone, having no responsibilities since Selene took his gun. \"What is it?\" Barrow didn't know that I still had the doll, as far as I am aware, so I had to be careful.\n\n\"What wish did you make that stopped the doll?\"\n\n\"I'd rather not say.\"\n\nAnd that was that, but I was nosey enough to press him. \"Is that why you can't feel anything anymore?\"\n\nHe looked at me for a moment. \"Not entirely.\"\n\n\"Do you miss it? The doll?\"\n\nBarrow stared off into the abyss, but didn't have an answer to that question. \"Do you see anything out there, like Em does?\"\n\nI didn't think sharing my experience with the tooth monster was wise. \"Do you?\"\n\n\"She has trauma with her father. He haunts her heart because she is a good person and he has forced her to do horrible things. That is why she sees him. I... I see something out there too. I think any of us with a past that weighs on our hearts do.\" Barrow continued to stare. \"I guess you are a better person than us.\"\n\n\"Or I haven't had the opportunity to be good. You can't really be traumatized by your decisions unless you have the desire to do something better.\"\n\nBarrow nodded. \"A small comfort.\"\n\n\"Was the old guy always like that?\" Em asked, having snuck off with Barrow's phone to use the bathroom.\n\nWe stood, Barrow, Selene, and I, to see that the elderly victim was a husk. I hadn't observed him very much at all since he had been killed, but I did know that bodies weren't supposed to go bad that quickly. He looked like a mummy, drained of all fluid. Now I am certain Jo wasn't here, the spider lady wasn't causing any of this. What else would suck out blood? I don't think goblins drink it.\n\n\"Is that just a side effect of the void?\"\n\n\"No, something slurped him up.\" Selene answered, then worried she'd offended the dead. \"Sorry, not slurped. Someone sucked out his blood.\"\n\nHe wasn't in the same place either. \"Did he... move?\" I asked.\n\n\"He's closer to the kitchen.\" Barrow confirmed my suspicion. \"We need more light over here.\"\n\n\\--------------------------------------\n\nMore time. Who knows how long. It may have been days, though it also could have been only thirty minutes. I stared at nothing for so long I thought I would go blind as static ate every corner of my vision. I grew so bored that I wished something would happen, but the doll had no influence here. Even the slight burning was not enough, I wanted a bit more of it. I was hungry, my throat was getting dry, and did I mention I was *bored*?\n\nThat boredom vanished when the crack of light from the top of Selene's office flickered.\n\n\"Selene!\" I pointed towards the office. \"Look!\"\n\nShe drew a deep breath and stood, and we followed suit. The gun was still in her hand, loaded and ready to use. I'd never seen her shoot before, then again I never saw Barrow do so either until that day. She slammed her fist on the office door.\n\n\"TIme to get out! I saw that light flicker!\"\n\nIt took Rick a moment to answer. \"I told you that if you came back I'd-\"\n\n\"Shoot all you want once you are out of there, but for your own sake come out of my office! You will DIE when that light goes out!\"\n\nHe hesitated. \"I have another light. Once mine goes out, I'll just turn on this other phone.\"\n\n\"It'll kill that one too. You'll need something new, from outside the office.\"\n\n\"Then give me your light.\"\n\n\"You know we need light too.\" Barrow answered. \"Stop being an ass and come out.\"\n\nThe light flickered more from underneath the door. \"Get out!\" I shouted, having nothing more to offer. A squeak drew our attention down the little hall where the flashlight hadn't been shining. There, in the second lobby, was Maggie.\n\nShe had cuts on her arms and torn clothes. Her face was covered in blood. \"I hurt him.\" She finally spoke. \"The monster, that is. I hurt him badly.\" There was a pocket knife in her hand, bloodied and open.\n\n\"You're alive?!\" Em explained. \"We thought you'd died. Ma'am you are crazy and I like it.\"\n\nHad Maggie... gained weight? She just seemed a bit wider than before. I know, that is rude to think, but it was a bit off. My memory isn't the best when it comes to appearances, though, so maybe not? I hadn't known her that long.\n\n\"What...?\" A mutter from the office, Rick was confused. There was more light from the office, but the flicker remained. \"You broke your phone, didn't you?!\" He shouted, hitting Jack. \"Wake up! FIX IT!\"\n\n\"I-I can't!\" Jack begged. \"I didn't break it!\"\n\n\"FIX IT!\"\n\nSelene grabbed the door handle and opened, but Rick had his gun ready fast. \"Don't you DARE!\"\n\nShe didn't, but her gun was trained on him. \"Just come out. The thing killing everyone is hurt, we are safe. We just *can't* be in there! Not without light!\"\n\n\"Then toss me that one!\" Rick challenged. \"I don't believe you!\"\n\n\"We aren't risking our only light!\"\n\nI had my phone, was that enough? \"What about-\"\n\nThe room shook. Well, not just the room, but the entire building. Something was happening. The floor creaked as the entire cafe trembled, threatening to fall apart. We kept our balance, though. We kept the flashlight. Rick, however, dropped both phones while catching himself on the office desk. It didn't really matter if he was holding the phones or not, the light would have gone out regardless.\n\nFlicker\n\nFlicker\n\nAnd it was gone. Both phones died at the same time, drowning them in darkness. I shined the flashlight into the office and they were still there. \"Should we give them one of our phones?\"\n\nAgain, the ground shook. \"We are going home.\" Selene swallowed. \"Give me the flashlight, we-\"\n\nThe sound of rapid footsteps turned me back towards the hall where I saw Barrow thrown into the second lobby. Maggie was on top of him, but she wasn't Maggie. The moment the flashlight touched her, she turned back, but I saw what she was before that. She was... meat. Just meat, a pile of sharpened bone and beef that was shaped like something living.\n\nWith her human mouth, she bit down on Barrow's arm and slurped what was offered.\n\nBarrow was able to shove her off in such a small form. She growled and rolled away, grabbing her pocket knife. It was more of a fair fight when she was trapped as a human, even more so when Selene raised the gun and fired a shot.\n\nThe ground shook again and Selene missed. I fell and the flashlight left Barrow, giving the monster the freedom to turn back into something hideous. Barrow didn't cry out, but I heard a crash and Barrow gasped for air.\n\n\"Light!\" He demanded. \"I need light!\"\n\nI gave it to him, but there was commotion from the office. \"Give us the damn flashlight!\" Rick shouted. \"It is in here with us! HELP!\"\n\n\"Please, please! Help us!\" Jack begged in tears. \"I didn't do anything!\"\n\nFlesh tore; Barrow needed the light more than me. He was cut up really badly, but he wasn't down. With the light on the meaty beast, Selene could aim to take a shot. \"Keep the flashlight on her!\" She demanded, waiting to take a shot so she didn't put Barrow down.\n\nHe grabbed her knife and drove it into her head. She cried out in pain but continued her assault without hesitation. Punches, bites, kicks; how such a normal body could put up such a fierce fight I do not know.\n\nSelene finally took a shot. Right through the chest, nothing.\n\n\"Turn off the flashlight when I say.\"\n\n*What?!* \"Are you insane?!\"\n\n\"Keep the light on!\" Em didn't like that plan. \"Don't turn it off!\"\n\n\"GIVE US THE LIGHT, PLEASE!\"\n\n\"PLEASE!\" Jack screamed. Such a terrible sound that will never leave my ears. I remembered Keith.\n\n\"Turn it off when I say!\" She demanded, and I would obey. There was nothing else to do. I was completely useless.\n\nBarrow fell to the ground, she began charging at him, and Selene lined up the shot. \"NOW!\"\n\nThe moment the flashlight was off, Selene shot. There was only heavy breathing, then a scream from the office. I turned back on the flashlight to see a pile of assorted meat sitting next to a torn up Barrow. When I turned the light on the office, however, I was reminded that none of us were safe. The endless darkness had replaced the ceiling, but it was not empty. A great eye watched from the depths, so far away that my mind could not comprehend the distance. It was the Eye of Gold, but corrupted by so much crimson that I thought it must be bleeding. Tendrils of and black floated from the eye towards the room, traveling so quickly and traversing so far that I wanted to throw up. Vomit, instead of trying to understand what I was seeing.\n\nI moved to give them the light, but Selene held up a hand. \"It is too late.\"\n\n\"Sweet, sweet meat.\" A gentle voice from the cosmos. \"Like dough in my hands.\"\n\nJack started crying again, Rick got up to run out of the room, but Selene was right.\n\nEm ran towards the door. \"Help them!\"\n\nIt was too late.\n\nLike a viper, a tendril struck out towards Rick and snatched him. It caught his wrist, which instantly began shedding its skin. He screamed such a horrible sound as he was skinned alive, dragged into the endless darkness. Jack knew his fate was the same, but he tried running too.\n\nI... I don't want to talk about him. Neither of them deserve that, no one does, but Rick had trapped Jack. He *really* didn't deserve such a fate. Rick was a pile of screaming meat when we lost sight of him and I am horrified to say that Jack wasn't much different. That was the Eye of Crimson and Gold, the great god I had made a deal with. I was tied to that thing somehow, and I again found myself overcome with unbearable nausea.\n\nSo I threw up.\n\nIt turns out it knew Selene too. \"Oh Guisipa.\" It whispered. \"Is that you I see?\"\n\nShe went rigid and the ground shook again. \"T-turn on t-the light!\" Her mouth was stuck, the words barely got out. I could see trees outside, but they were distant and faint. We were nearly home!\n\n\"Oh... oh Guisipa.\" It cooed from infinity. \"Come back to me, my dear daughter.\"\n\nShe began sliding towards the door, her feet locked in place. \"T-the light! P-please!\" Selene was crying.\n\nI grabbed on to her. Em got a hold, even Barrow, with all his wounds, came to buy us time. The god above was stronger than us, we could only buy seconds. The trees got closer, I heard wind and a storm. It was raining back home. The eye was beyond strong, we were nothing and could not halt its will. The trees were so close! I could see our cars, the parking lot! Tendril was at the doorway, waiting to welcome Selene back to some ancient family. Was this what she was? She could not go back!\n\nThe ground shook so hard that I thought the walls would fall down on us. Glasses from the espresso machine fell and shattered, lamps crashed to the ground, and we lost our grip on our manager. She flung towards the doorway, struck her head on the frame, and the office light came back on.\n\nBarrow had his finger on the switch, having been faster than any of us could be. He alone saved Selene. She was on the office floor unmoving, the light giving us a clear view of the blood that was pooling near her head. Her hitting the doorframe may have saved her from the ancient eye god, but it may have killed her too.\n\n\"She isn't human.\" Em hurried towards her, hesitating for only a moment at the doorway. \"I can help her if she isn't human! Maybe!\"\n\nWith help from Barrow, they flipped Selene over. I was useless, still shining the flashlight as if it would do some good. There was an emptiness, a terrible sense of dread that told me Selene would die. What sort of horrible thing is that, when you realize just how important someone is to you only when they are gone? There was too much blood. She was probably already dead. I wanted to just lay down and cease to be. There was no reason to do anything anymore.\n\nHer forehead was cracked, her eye socket split as well. I felt so light, so empty. But Em placed her hand on her head. *\"di'Guisipa is'grenti.\"* She muttered. I remember it clearly, it made my ears tickle. \"Please be her name! *diGuisipa is'grenti!\"*\n\nAnd Selene opened her good eye.\n\n\\--------------------------------------\n\nWe all made it out alive. Selene has an eyepatch now and a few stitches that Em helped put in (she isn't human so she can't exactly see a doctor). Of course, I haven't forgotten the customers that we lost. Bilgoth too, because I am assuming he is dead. Sure, he did wear our friends, but I don't think he hurt anyone.\n\nI got sick immediately after. It was a lot like the flu, but my mouth hurt a lot. I think I have a cavity too. Em got sick as well, but Barrow was fine. Selene has been resting as much as possible.\n\nOh, and Richard hired a new person. Penny. You'll meet her soon. I’ll be training her, apparently, as per Richard I am ‘no longer a new guy.’ Not sure what to think about that. Barrow is nearly in pieces, but he is healing faster than Selene. Any other person would have been dead multiple times over but he was fine. He acted as if nothing had happened. I guess perhaps his abilities go beyond simply not feeling?\n\nSorry this update took so long to get out. It is hard writing about people that died, even if it wasn't due to anything that was your fault. Rick, Jack, and that old guy; we remember you. I can't really give your family closure, I don't even know who any of you really were, but you deserved better. Well, maybe not Rick, but still.\n\nAnd now I know Selene's name. That isn't good, for reasons all of you know. I'd ask you not to mention why in the comments, since Selene seems to be following this story now. Please, let me make a plan. Do this for me.\n\nThat is all I ask.",

But little was my notion, that when we parted by the ocean, that we were forever parted by the banks of the lee...\"***\n\n**-- Silly Wizard,** ***Banks of the Lee***\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\"Flight 249 now boarding, I repeat, Flight 249 now boarding!\"**\n\nMy head snapped up from my phone to look at the overhead screen. Sure enough, there was the numbers to my flight. Flight 249, One way to Scotland. This was it.\n\nTaking a deep breath, I picked up my bags and began walking to the terminal, walking toward the metaphorical gateway to my new life. I looked back one last time behind me, taking one last look at what I was soon to be leaving behind. For a moment, I was actually hesitant to go the rest of the way through the terminal.\n\n*There's nothing for you here, Rick.* I reminded myself before taking another deep breath. *She's gone now. They both are.* I took a moment to let one or two stray tears fall down my face before facing forward and walking through the terminal. I quietly found a seat and made myself comfortable.\n\nStrangely, I can remember just how quiet it was while the flight was boarding. People stepped onto the plane, disregarding each other for the most part. Everyone had this cold, lifeless look on their faces, like they, too, were trying to just get the hell out of town the same way I was. It was about another half hour before the announcement came over the loudspeaker. That I think if it, I don't remember at any point hearing any of the cabin attendants going over safety procedures or anything, though, I admittedly wasn't paying much attention to much once I'd sat down, having put my earbuds in and turned on my ASMR app.\n\nI was exhausted, having prepared for this trip for at least a week straight. I couldn't sleep at all through that week, nor do I think any of you would've been able to either if every time you closed your eyes, you had the same nightmare. If every time you laid down at night, you saw the face of your loved one be engulfed in fire, screaming out to you to save them, before having her flesh seared from her bones, would you be able to sleep peacefully?\n\nTo this day, I still wonder how the hell I didn't lose my mind long before all this went down. Being perfectly honest, I should've gone mad when it all happened, especially given just how little of what happened that I understood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nIt was two years ago that Irene and I had decided to go to the mountains for our 3 year anniversary. The two of us were a couple of sweethearts since college and I even proposed to her at our graduation party. Since then, we had been a happy little pair of lovebirds until that day.\n\nLike I said, I can't really describe much of what happened in any comprehensible way. So much happened so quickly. I remember me and her were hiking about three quarters of the way up the mountain when we stopped, having to rest our legs. Panting, I remarked to her, \"Jeez, you'd think after all that time doing track, we'd have made it a little further, huh?\"\n\n\"Says you,\" she replied, scoffing. She made her voice try to go deep to sound like me, saying, *\"Oh hon, can we PLEASE stop, I gotta rest my legs.\"*\n\n\"I said that cause you were draggin' ass behind me, slowpoke.\" She smirked, flipped me off, and delivered a punch to the shoulder for my smart ass mouth. I laughed and said, \"You call that a punch? Come on, mama, I know you can hit harder than *that*.\" She snickered before stiffening her upper lip into a defiant smirk and trying to hit me again. This time, I caught her wrists and trapped them in a criss-cross, holding her still. She struggled against me for a second before conceding.\n\nSighing, she said, \"Okay, babe, you win. You're the strongest. And the handsomest.\" She said this last part with a wink and a sly grin parting the corner of her mouth. I almost didn't even notice though, having lost myself in her eyes; those ember red jewels that sat peacefully in the middle of two oceans of midnight seas, burning right through my eyes, through my mind, and straight through to my heart and soul every time I stared into them. For a moment, the only sound around the two of us, the only signs of life from around us, was the singular sound of the breeze whipping our hair and the clothes on our backs.\n\n\"What?\" she asked. I shook my head, blinking.\n\n\"Huh?\" I asked.\n\n\"Can I go now, officer?\" she joked, her grin growing amused again. I looked down to see I still had her wrists. I chuckled nervously, releasing her wrists.\n\n\"Sorry about that. Just... kinda lost myself there for a sec.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Her sly grin returned. \"You tryin' to say you like playin' rough?\" She giggled and winked. I chuckled.\n\n\"No just... God, have I told you that you have the prettiest eyes in the world?\"\n\nShe snickered and replied, \"A million times, actually; 3,000 just today.\" I smiled.\n\n\"And I'll happily tell you a million times more.\" After that, the silence pervaded the trail around us. The only sounds of life around us was the early autumn breeze whipping our hair and the clothes on our backs. Gradually, almost unconsciously, our bodies came closer and closer to one another until eventually, our eyes closed and our lips met. We stayed locked on each other's embrace for a whole 25 seconds, the heat of the moment actually drowning out the chill of the wind pricking our bodies. I'd like to say that we'd have never separated, had it not been for the fact that I could feel the heat intensify from her body.\n\nIt was a whole five seconds before I opened my eyes, doing so only after I felt Irene's hands jerk away from my body like she was in a hurry to get away from me. When I did open my eyes, I saw Irene looking horrified at her hands. \"Irene?\" I asked, feeling my heart rate jump from 0 to 10,000 in that half a second time span. \"Baby, what's wrong?\"\n\nShe looked at me, opening her mouth to speak, only to get cut off by a sharp cry of pain that had her doubling over, clutching her stomach. \"Irene!\" I reached out to her, but instantly retracted when I saw her body beginning to glow. She cried out in pain, her body glowing brighter and brighter. I began to feel heat, *intense* heat, like her body in itself was an exploding star, emitting from her body that I even saw beginning to singe the hair from my arms.\n\nThe brighter her body glowed, the harder it became for me to be able to see her. I shouted, \"Irene!\" For a brief moment, I saw her eyes stare back at me, wide and afraid.\n\n\"Richard!\" she cried. When I reached for her again, a searing pain ran across my arm and when I pulled it back, I saw the skin beginning to blister. Before I could try again, to do *anything*, her body released a sort of shockwave of blinding light that coupled with a scorching blaze of heat that made me almost swear for a moment that I was on fire. I was forced to shield my eyes and when I opened them again, I was alone.\n\nI looked all around. Nothing. \"I-Ir-Irene?\" My head swung furiously all around. \"Irene! IRENE!\"\n\nThere was no answer, from anywhere. My head stopped swinging when I looked down at where she was standing. Right there, in front of me, in place of my beautiful wife, was a large black spot where I could see small wafts of smoke jumping from it to pollute the sky. At that moment, I dropped to my knees and began screaming Irene's name deliriously. I'd have sworn I was there for next to an eternity, having continued my howling until my throat tore itself in half (not even much of an exaggeration, either, judging from the doctor's visit I had to take later on because of it), but at some point, a couple walking by found me and asked me what was wrong.\n\nI'll say two things; first, bless them for actually giving enough of a damn to stop and want to even *try* listening to some howling stranger who no doubt scared the hell out of them with his racket, and second, if they *were* able to understand a damn bit of the inane gibberish I was spewing at them, then they deserve an award of some sort. I tried my best to tell them, in one way or another, that my wife was missing.\n\nThey helped me down and off the mountain -- by which I really mean they more or less dragged me away from the black, smoldering remains of my wife, kicking and screaming like a lunatic (Like I said, bless them) -- and escorted me to the nearest police station. From there, it was more or less the same situation, with me trying to explain something to them that I didn't understand while having no composure whatsoever. Long story short, they told me to go home and that they'd search for her. Told me they'd find her...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI started awake on the plane. For a moment, my head swiveled around the cabin. *IRENE?!*\n\nEverything was still quiet. Everyone was still, facing forward, either with their heads down, likely on their phones or something, or just staring blankly at the cockpit. I relaxed once more in my seat.\n\n*She's gone Rick...*\n\nI looked out of the window to my right. The sky was a perfect shade of blue, the kind of shade you don't normally see unless you're right there in it, swimming or at least floating in it. Unless it's all around you, in a way that's achievable only when you're 50,000 feet in the air, on a plane...\n\nOr on a mountainside...\n\nI shook my head, turning away from the window. *It's been two goddamn years. She's gone, she ain't coming back.* Readjusting myself in my chair, I refixed my earbuds and restarted the app. In seconds, I was once again in sleep's numbing embrace. images of the perfect blue sky, of Irene, were soo quite literally drowned out by those of gray, cloudy skies, unleashing a torrential downpour upon stone cold earth. It was the perfect diversion. Anodyne, of you will, allowing me to completely forget about Irene. Forget about my old life. Forget that I was alone...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\"I have your heart, so long as it beats, Ricky-boy...\" she said, giggling. She sat on my lap as I laid across my old, torn up couch, straddling me, wearing her sports bra and leggings. She'd just gotten home from Yoga practice. She'd hopped on me as soon as she'd walked through the door.\n\nShe was smiling down at me, causing me to lose myself in her eyes. She ran her fingers along my chest, slowly running them along so I'll feel every soft inch of them as she went. \"Well, I'm glad to see you home, too, babe.\" I replied, chuckling. She giggled her adorable little girlish giggle; a giggle who's sound is matched by the giggle of a baby, before leaning down to touch her nose to mine. \"What's the occasion?\" I asked, grinning.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she replied with her own smile widening.\n\n\"You're awfully cheery this afternoon. Usually, you're tired after yoga practice. What, did you have a little extra something in your shake today?\" She laughed, throwing your head back.\n\n\"Maybe a *little* bit...\" she replied with a joking sense of guilt, giving me the look a child gives when they're caught eating glue paste.\n\n\"A little bit, huh?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh...\"\n\n\"God, you're adorable, you know that?\"\n\n\"Like you'll ever let me forget.\" she joked. \"And you're such a little goof, you know that?\"\n\nI winked, \"Like you'd ever let me forget.\" Her grin stretched from one ear to the other as she gave me a peck on the nose before laying her head down on my chest, nuzzling her head directly in the center of my pecs. Looking down at her, with the rays of the afternoon sun just ever so gently stroking her face the same way her fingers so tenderly caressed my chest, giving her an almost blazing aura that I could actually detect the heat from, I told myself, *Yep, Ricky-boy, you really are the luckiest man alive. Despite the rinky-dink apartment, long, exhausting -- though decently paying -- job, and whatever bullshit you carry around with you in your day to day life, you have this angel on your chest, and she happily holds your heart.*\n\nThe heat radiating from her began getting to me more and more. I noticed beads of sweat forming on my forehead. I began looking around the room, looking for the thermostat. Her head raised up again to look me in the eyes. \"Baby, what's wrong?\"\n\n\"Huh? Oh, uh, nothing, just...\" I paused for a moment, a feeling of nausea briefly taking effect on me. \"Is it getting hot in here?\" She chuckled.\n\n\"No, I think it's just you.\" She winked saying this. I chuckled, though not as relaxed as before, and replied, \"Yeah, but seriously, though, you don't feel that?\"\n\n\"Feel what?\"\n\n\"I don't know, it's burning up in here. Can you see the thermostat?\" She looked over to the far corner of the living room.\n\n\"It's only room temperature, hon,\" she said, her smile slowly giving way to a look of concern. \"Are you feeling okay?\"\n\n\"I think so.\" She put her the back of her had to my forehead. Almost immediately I winced, feeling like a scorching piece of metal had been pressed against it.\n\n\"Oh shit, Ricky, you *are* burning up.\"\n\n\"Look who's talking.\" I joked. Her face, however, told me she wasn't taking it that way. Her eyebrows raised.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"You're even hotter than I am right now.\"\n\n\"Babe, I'm serious, I think you have a fever.\"\n\n\"I'm serious, too, your hand was just shy of singeing my hair just now.\" She got up and walked into the kitchen before returning with a glass of water and a couple of Tylenols. For just a moment, I swore I saw the water in the glass begin bubbling, the way it would if it were boiling. I didn't say anything, though.\n\n\"Here, take a couple of these. I'll make some food later, okay?\" I did as requested, despite knowing damn well I didn't have a fever. After that, she went to take a shower. I laid alone on the couch, alone once again. My mind was divided between thoughts of joining her in the shower and wonder at just what happened there.\n\nWhat was going on with Irene's skin just now, I wondered. I know she was directly under the sun and all, but it shouldn't have heated up like that, should it? I ended up electing the former option, to join her, and got up from the couch, undressing as I went toward the bathroom. I, almost skillfully in a way, managed to slip into the bathroom completely unnoticed; quieter than a mouse. Immediately upon entering, though, I noticed just how humid the air became. From the instant I walked in, it was like I'd walked into a steam room, moisture and steam from the air almost suffocating me. I actually had to turn around and walk right back out.\n\n*How the hell can SHE stand it in there?* I looked back into the bathroom. The water was still running, steam was still billowing out in clouds from the open doorway. Despite this, I could still hear Irene's soft, tender voice singing *\"May it be\",* not at all impeded by the heat. At one point, starting to put my clothes back on, I looked in the bathroom and my eyes widened when I saw a bright orange glow coming from. I was about to investigate further, but before I could reach the bathroom again, the glow disappeared and the water was turned off.\n\nNot knowing what the hell I was supposed to do -- if anything, really -- I went back to laying on the couch. Irene stepped out of the bathroom, towel drying her hair while the towel around her body slowly found itself falling away from her, \"accidentally\" revealing herself. Normally, I'd either get caught red-handed staring or I'd try to pretend not to notice; both of which elicited sly, playful giggles from her before one thing would lead to another and well...\n\nBut this time when she caught me staring, it was with a puzzled look on my face. \"What is it, hon?\" she asked.\n\n\"Um, nothing, just... I thought I saw something.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I don't know, something glowing.\" She frowned.\n\n\"Glowing?\"\n\n\"Yeah, from the bathroom, while you were in the shower.\" She turned to look back at the bathroom before looking at me while pointing to it. I held up my dismissively. She did another double-take before shrugging the whole thing off and telling me that she was tired out after yoga and that she'd be going to lay down. She went into the bedroom while I remained on the couch; alone, confused.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI awoke, this time needing the restroom. It was night out, though everyone still appeared awake. Hundreds of blank eyes, dead faces, and hollow stares all focused forward. I'll admit, by this point, this was beginning to unnerve me. Why was everybody seemingly acting weird, all at the same time?\n\nRegardless, I slowly walked to the back of the cabin toward the restroom. At least, where I *thought* the restroom was. When I made it to the other end of the plane, though, as far as I could go, anyways, I couldn't find the restrooms anywhere. I looked and started back in the other direction. Along the way, I kept looking along the walls to see if maybe I missed the sign along the way. Needless to say, though, I hadn't.\n\nThen I started looking for an attendant or someone who might be able to help me. Through all of this, silence itself had a chokehold on the entire plane. I felt like I wasn't even *on* a plane, like I wasn't even *awake*! I made it to the front end of the plane and knocked in the door to the cockpit. I stood there for about a good 15 minutes with nothing at all happening. I wasn't sure whether I was supposed to knock again or just go back to my seat. In the end, the answer, to my surprise, would be neither as, shockingly, the door opened and out stepped a young, rail thin lady in an attendant's uniform.\n\n\"Excuse me, ma'am?\" I asked. She didn't respond, or move -- or even seem to breathe for that matter. \"Sorry to bother you, but I can't seem to find the restroom, you think you'd be able to help me out?\"\n\nShe continued staring at me with almost corpselike eyes; glazed looking and grayish white in color. Her mouth also seemed to hang sort of limply. Her face perfectly portrayed the emptiness of both her mind and her heart. In this sense, she didn't look dead -- she was *less than dead*. I waved my hand in front of her face, garnering no response from that, either.\n\n\"Ahem, may I speak to the captain, then?\" For the record, I knew that this wouldn't ever be allowed under normal circumstances, but A, these weren't exactly \"normal circumstances\", were they, and B, I was on the verge of slapping her just to get *some* kind of reaction or answer out of her, ad so I figured asking something a bit ludicrous wasn't altogether pointless.\n\nMore to my shock, it actually worked as she slowly spoke, saying in the most scratchy, monotone voice, devoid entirely of any recognizable emotion, save *maybe* depression (and even that's a bit of a stretch), \"Please return to your seat, sir. We will be reaching our final destination soon.\"\n\nThe way her mouth moved, coupled with the deadpanned tone in her voice, I almost swore it was some sort of puppet talking to me. \"Um... O-Okay, but I need the restroom, can you just tell me where--\"\n\n\"The time is almost here, sir. It will all be over soon.\" My eyes widened.\n\n\"E-Excuse me?\" I said, feeling my heart already starting to kick into overdrive.\n\n\"It will all be over soon, sir.\" she repeated, slowly turning back toward the door.\n\n\"B-But wait--\"\n\n\"Please return to your seat, sir.\" was the last thing I heard from her before she shut the door back in my face. For a moment, I stood, dumbfounded. *The hell was that? What was her problem?*\n\nI turned to look back at the other passengers. Each one of them stared unblinkingly toward me; not at me, but rather *through* me, the same way the attendant was just a second ago. *What the hell is going on?*\n\nI would've been a lot more inclined to press the attendant again for answers -- namely what the hell she meant by \"It will all be over soon\" -- but unfortunately, my need for the bathroom all but diminished any concentration I had with that. That's when I decided to take matters into my own hands and start hunting for the restroom myself again. I went through the cabin for about another 10 minutes, each one that passed making it harder and harder to hold it in, until I finally found what looked like a restroom about midway through. How I missed it, especially given that it was located just a few rows from where I was sitting, I didn't know, nor did I care.\n\nI rushed as quickly as I could to the door and swung it open before all but hurling myself headfirst inside. While I was in there, I started thinking again about what the flight attendant said. Now normally, I'd have chalked it up to just her having an off day or something. But then, why was *everybody* having an off day? Why was she the only one that'd speak at all?\n\n*\"We'll be reaching our final destination soon, sir.\"*\n\n*Why does that sound so familiar?* I thought then of her voice. Her face, how lifeless it looked, as well as the faces of the other passengers. All of it was familiar to me in a way that gave me an almost physically sickening feeling...\n\nBut why?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\"You okay, honey bunny?\" I asked her. She was on the couch, looking glumly out of the window. Her eyes broke from the window to look at me. The expression on her face was dead, careless, unfiltered, untouched with any sort of emotion. \"Irene, what's wrong?\"\n\nShe sighed, a sort of sigh that I almost couldn't hear. It was less like a sigh, actually, and more like she was just giving away her last breath. My heart melted right then and there, not even knowing what the hell was wrong. The sun shone, clear skies, and we were even off from work that day. I was even planning on surprising her with a trip to the movies -- her number one go-to when it came to ideas for date nights.\n\nI went over and reached out to put my hand on her shoulder when she retracted away from my hand. I froze, unsure of what I should or even *could* do. In all of that time, a little over two and a half years into our marriage, she'd never once gotten into moods like this. She always had the most beaming, vibrant, free-spirited personality I'd ever seen in a woman. She'd always been the sunshine to *my* cloudiest days, while I was always the one that kept her \"down to the Earth\" so to speak, keeping her feet on the ground, you know? But this...\n\n\"Irene, baby, talk to me, what happened?\" She looked at me; looking more *through* my eyes than at them. Her mouth slowly opened and she spoke in a voice I almost couldn't believe was coming from her. It sounded like I was hearing an answering machine talk to me -- with somehow even *less* inflection than one, if that was even possible.\n\n\"It's all going to end soon.\"\n\n\"Wh-What?\" I frowned. She kept staring, her face not wavering in the slightest. \"Baby, what're you talking about, *what's* ending?\"\n\nShe looked to the window again. I followed her gaze. Everything was normal outside. Vibrant. Alive. Cheerful.\n\n\"It's all ending, I can feel it.\" I slowly put my hand on her shoulder. I instantly jerked back when I felt that her skin was all of a sudden blistering hot again. It'd done this a few times before, and I could never understand why.\n\n\"Baby, you're burning up.\" I said to her. Her eyes didn't move from the window this time.\n\n\"It's coming to an end. Everything.\"\n\n\"I-I don't understand, what're you--\"\n\n\"Look at it all, Rick.\" I stopped, turning back toward the window. \"It's beautiful, isn't it?\"\n\nI stayed silent for a moment before answering, \"Y-Yeah it-it is.\" She let out another very faint sigh.\n\n\"Something's happening, Rick. To me. I-I...\" She trailed off for a moment before finishing with, \"I can feel it.\"\n\n\"What's coming?\" I asked.\n\n\"I... I don't know. I don't know what it is or why it's happening, but... I know it is, and it's happening soon.\" About ten to twenty minutes passed in silence after that. There was no real comeback for that, no optimistic or comforting thought I could give. Call me what you will; \"Terrible consolation\", \"Poor bedside manner\", or what have you, I didn't have any words of comfort to offer my wife in that moment. Like I said, she had never behaved or talked like this before, so I had absolutely no way to respond to this. And also like I mentioned, I was never the most uplifting type myself.\n\nDoing my best to at least *try* to comfort her, I spoke up in my cheeriest voice possible (though one that likely wouldn't have cheered up a crying child, let alone someone as depressed as she was), \"Hey, I think we should go to the movies today! We don't have work and I believe they're playing--\" I stopped when she turned to look at me, her face still dead as a doornail.\n\n\"Did you not hear a word I just said?\" She asked, her voice remaining in it's deadlocked monotone. I clammed up. \"I... I just can't, Rick. Not when I know it's all going to be over soon anyway.\" She took one last look at the window before getting up from the couch and walking into the bedroom.\n\n\"Wait, Irene, what're you--\" But she was shutting the door right as I was finishing. I stayed in the living room, sitting alone, speechless, with both my heart jackhammering in my chest as well as my head spinning all the way around like my it was a globe for a solid fifteen minutes. I couldn't decided whether I was supposed to go to her, to try again to comfort her, *somehow*, or if I should just stay there, sitting on my knees, staring at the hallway, jaw slacked, like an idiot.\n\nI wanted to hold her, don't get me wrong. I wanted to squeeze her the way you'd squeeze a plush toy when you were sad. I wanted to clutch her tightly to me like if I were to let go, I and the whole of reality would fall apart. But then, would that have made any difference?\n\nRegardless, a few moments later, I decided to get up from the floor and walked into the bedroom. On the bed laid my wife, laying straight and stiff on her right side, facing away from the doorway. I froze at the sight for two reasons. For starters, she never slept like this. She was always one to curl up into a ball, making it perfect to nuzzle against me, giving me that almost fatherly feeling like I was nestling a sleeping child next to me. But now this, as well the fact that her body was glowing.\n\nI rubbed my eyes to make sure I was seeing it correctly. Sure enough, amid the darkness, with the only *other* light perhaps coming from the window, bleeding past the curtains, there she was, a golden aura beaming around her. She was stiff, rigid, still, making me wonder if she was awake, asleep, or if she was dead. My foot raised to take a step, but I wasn't sure what to do. Of course, the logical answer would've been to go to her, maybe snuggle her close to me and say... well, that was just it, what the hell *was* I supposed to say?\n\nMy wife was glowing, and like the other times before, I could feel the heat blazing from her body. She was a sun in the middle of a dark abyss, a flame flickering in a dark hallway, one that appeared to be flickering out. The sight of this was killing me with every second I spent looking at it because of the fact that I knew she was in pain, but from what I couldn't begin to know. I finally took the step forward, then another, and another.\n\nMy feet more or less moved absently from my body. My mind and my body acted separate from each other; with every instinct telling me I needed to stay at the doorway and (albeit feebly) try figuring out what the hell's going on before I try going to her, while my body all but flipped its deuces at that and continued forward. I silently reached the bed, where I slowly climbed in behind her and went to put my arm around her when I froze, a stinging pain starting to shoot throughout my arm.\n\nMy arm hovered there for a moment before curling back to my body. And so, unable to touch her or say anything to her, I just laid there, staring at her stiffened back. The room was warm, quiet, the way you'd imagine a fireplace to sound, save the crackle of the flames. I don't know when or how long it'd been when I had the idea, but I suddenly found it in me to speak up. \"Hey, you wanna do something cool for our anniversary?\"\n\nShe made no movements, voicing no response. I continued anyway, \"You know, we never did get to make it to the top of the mountains like we'd always planned.\" She still didn't move, but I did see the glow around her starting to dim. Out of a sort of instinct, I reached out again to tough her back. It was still warm, but tolerable and becoming cooler and cooler by the second. I couldn't tell you why, other than a guess that whatever the hell it was that was going on with her, it was somehow liked to her emotions or something. In other words, my words were getting through to her in some way, comforting her.\n\nI started softly caressing her back along the length of her spine. Her skin continued to cool under my fingers. \"I can still see us,\" I started again, forming the image in my head of the two of us on the mountainside that day, three years ago, the day I first proposed to her. \"You remember, Baby?\"\n\n\"The clear, sunny sky, the big puffy clouds.\" I chuckled, \"You always call them \"Sky pillows\". Remember how we were laying down and looking at the sky pillows, trying to see who'd be the first to spot one that looked like a fish?\" Her body had all but stopped glowing by now and her body was just mildly lukewarm. Her skin felt soft and mellow again.\n\n\"I think you were the first one to actually find one. Said it looked like Nemo for some reason. I couldn't ever see it...\"\n\n\"Marlin.\" I heard her say faintly.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"It was Marlin, not Nemo.\" I chuckled.\n\n\"Right, Marlin, my bad.\"\n\n\"He was bigger than most of the other ones, but still only noticeable if you were looking, just like an actual fish in the ocean. Just like you.\" That's when I finally felt her body start to move beneath my fingers. She shifted around to face me. Her face was hard to see, with only half of it illuminated by the ever-dimming rays from the window. That said, I could see that her haunting glare of sorrow, her empty stare, was gone, replaced with a more familiarly tender and loving face, the one a mother gives her child when they're what makes them smile that day.\n\n\"You always stood out to me; my lost little fish, alone in the sea, looking for something, but wasn't sure what.\" Her hand moved up to my chest, stroking it like how I stroked her back.\n\n\"You always had the better eyes of us both.\" I said. \"We stayed out there till the sun started going down.\"\n\n\"And all the little sky pillows went away...\" she finished, slipping a small, yet oh, so adorable little giggle.\n\nI snickered, \"Remember how we fell asleep, right there on the mountainside, and the ranger had to wake us up to run us out of there?\" I giggled, \"And you thought he was \"Smokey the bear.\" Her laugh was noticeable this time. \"You started freaking out and I had to hold onto you to keep from going apeshit on the guy.\" I took a deep breath then before asking her, \"You remember what I said to you?\"\n\nShe rolled over again, putting her face first on top of me, looking directly into my eyes, and she answered, \"Irene, baby doll, I will always love you, till the end of time\". You reached into your pocket and pulled out this ring, the most beautiful ring I'd ever seen.\" She held up her finger. \"And I grabbed you up and tried to snap you in half with a bear hug.\"\n\n\"Damn near did, too.\" I said, chuckling. She grinned a toothy grin, allowing the last rays of light from the window to accentuate each and every one of her beautiful, ivory teeth. She moved in closer, bringing her nose close to mine, and the two of us kissed. Knowing now that her skin was normal again, I slowly brought my hands up to take ahold of her gently. The two of stay in an eternal embrace for the rest of that afternoon, with her falling asleep curled up next to me, her face nuzzled in my chest.\n\nI stayed awake, though. I was unable to sleep. I couldn't risk the thought of something happening to her while I was asleep.\n\n*\"It's all going to end anyways...\"*\n\nHer words echoed through my head, hollowing it out in my brain, making *it* the single dominant thought. It was a lone voice that looped in my head, piercing the otherwise peacefully quiet atmosphere of the bedroom. What could any of it mean, though?\n\nI looked down at my wife's beautiful face, sound asleep, and wondered just what could've been going through that beaming, amazing mind of hers. What could she have been dreaming about? Was that what started this? Maybe she just had a bad dream and took it too seriously?\n\n*But what was going on with her body?* I ran my hand along her back again. other than being maybe a *bit* warmer than normal, her skin was otherwise completely normal. She remained still, not fidgeting or talking in her sleep the way she usually would if she was having a nightmare. She was sound. She was safe. I hugged her as close to me as I could and held her like that until the sun rose the next morning.\n\n*\"... All coming to an end...\"*",

If you feel even the slightest tinge of distress as you are reading this I humbly suggest you stop here and receive my expression of love and remorse, and continue only at the risk of reliving unbearable trauma. I now apologize if even this small hint at what you have endured has burdened you with yet even more undue harm, but I have been shown that I must atone and therefore first I must confess.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nAs the sun snuck through the haze to dip out from its responsibilities to the atmosphere on Saturday evening, 2022, I was distraught.\n\nIn a single falling grain of sand, you all had taken the world from me. My World; My World had stripped its presence from me, evermore. I realize that separate and alone as you all are now this must sound like unintelligible gibberish, and I suppose that on a practical level that isn’t far from the truth so I will simply go directly to the heart of the matter.\n\nNienow, the love of my entire eternal existence, faded from life with his eyes locked and intertwined inseparably with my own. In that moment a part of me was yanked like a ragdoll from the tapestry of existence, and although I could not understand even the smallest fragment of what I saw, there was no denying the sensation that nothing prevented me from reaching out to undo and reweave whatever patterns I saw fit. The other thing that I could somehow then understand by sheer instinct was that this newly separated aspect of my self could not remain separated for long. If I wanted to do anything at all I would have to do it quickly, and in that moment the only thing on my mind was seeking retribution from whoever might be responsible for the loss of my light.\n\nWhen I put my nose to the tapestry, it quickly became apparent that my question might be much more complicated than at first it seemed. Nienow was murdered in cold blood by a single man you see, so at first my task seemed as simple as stitching the murderer’s existence into a circular garment of unending torture. But when I looked closer I could see that the man who actually pulled the trigger was driven by weaves of much larger threads, and following those back only led to a larger immutable pattern of hostility and hatred.\n\nSo to make a long story short, I panicked in my haste and just decided to weave a single thread through each and every one of the others thus woven into the fabric, some unfortunately many times over, and tie that thread off to that place in my heart which was the source of so much suffering and agony. I held all of us there like that, all of existing sentience, until I finally felt my stamina begin to wane and knew that I could not sustain this separation of mind and spirit much longer. I untied the thread, slipped back together into my body, and died in that name.\n\nThere is no use in me describing the practical details of your forgotten agonies, as by design they were the products of your own imagination. If those of you who are truly morbid genuinely desire to understand what you experienced, you need only imagine the worst thing you can and forget that it is only imagined.",

        "text": "\n\nKim and I wanted to go backpacking during spring break. It started with her showing me a post online of a beautiful rocky overlook with a waterfall in the distance. We hadn't been on a real vacation since we were kids. Something about the picture made me feel nostalgic, remembering a nature reserve close to our childhood home. Once I mentioned the park to her, we were almost instantly making site reservations. We spent hours, late into the night, excitedly chatting about our upcoming trip together. I was looking forward to a week away with my best friend, and most definitely looking forward to a break from my thesis. \n\nThe days leading up to our trip were spent buying gear and supplies. We might have spent a little too much for the trip we were taking. The park wasn't anything extravagant, nothing like a national park is, but it was still beautiful nonetheless with a nice, long hiking trail. We planned on spending our mornings hiking and taking in the sights, setting up camp in the early afternoons to relax in a secluded area. Even for this time of year, the park would hardly be busy. Most people are attracted to the nearby coasts and cities for spring break. Kim and I may just be lucky enough to have the park to ourselves, give or take a jogger or two.\n\nOur drive to the reserve was peaceful once we got outside the campus and inner-city traffic. The scenery gradually shifted from businesses and residences to a heavy coverage of trees. We came across other cars at increasingly infrequent periods. Kim could hardly sit still in her seat, her excitement was plastered across her face. She planned on taking full advantage of the quietness to 'meditate' and 'find her inner self.' While I didn't quite understand what she meant, I wasn't going to complain because I knew I can find time to myself to catch up on some reading. \n\nThe drive took us a couple of hours to reach the park. We parked and unloaded the car, lugging a heavy bag of supplies over my shoulder. We had seven miles to hike before we made it to the first site of our trip. Kim wouldn't stop complaining about halfway through already. I started getting annoyed before realizing myself we were both irritable from the drive and hike already. We were impatient to relax for the rest of the day. Our site was a very welcomed sight once it came into view. Kim and I started hanging our hammocks as soon as we could, desperate to get off our feet. Just as I suspected, we were the only ones in the park for break. We didn't pass nor hear another person the whole time we were on our way to the campground. My car was the only car in the lot. It was looking to be a quiet, relaxing vacation, just as we needed.\n\nAs night fell, the park came more alive. We were still the only people here as far as I could tell. Nocturnal animals began to stir. Occasionally, we heard a coyote call here and a fox scream there. Growing up in the area, these sounds were commonplace to us. It felt good to be back home. I slid into my hammock and let the sounds of nature put me to sleep.\n\nI wasn't sure what time it was when I was startled awake, it must have been in the middle of the night. The stars shifted and it was still pitch black. I blinked and tried to see my way through the darkness. I wasn't sure what woke me up at first, until the still of night was interrupted. In the short distance, a shrill, fear-stricken scream pierced the quiet veil of night. I felt the hair on the back of my neck stand straight up. It sounded human. I woke Kim and told her what I heard. She played it oof as me hearing a fox and still being half asleep. After some minutes of bickering, she convinced me to try and go back to sleep. I stayed awake for what felt like an hour, not hearing another wail like before. \n\nDaylight blinded me as I was scared awake once more. It was that scream again. I shot a look over to Kim, she was still asleep in her hammock. The scream rang once more, this time it sounded like it was on top of us. I took my utility knife out, my eyes frantically darting around trying to pinpoint the sound. It screamed again, however, something sounded off about it. It didn't sound completely human anymore. It sounded like it was right above us in the trees now. I woke Kim and immediately put my finger to my lips, pointing up to where the scream originated. Her eyes went wide when she finally heard what I have been hearing since last night. Our eyes scanned the trees as the screaming continued. Suddenly, Kim began laughing almost uncontrollably. I glared at her and shushed her once more. She shook her head and pointed to a tree limb right above us. I followed her finger to a large, black mass perched over our hammocks. It screamed that same scream. I felt so stupid. The entire time I was shaking in fear, the sound that scared me was no less than a raven mimicking what could only be some hiker taking a fall on the trail. Relieved, I laughed alongside Kim. We were both put at ease to find out the disembodied shrieks were simply a bird making noises. We shooed it away from our site, and gave a scolding scream before it took off.\n\nOur morning was peaceful afterwards. We packed up and headed further along the trail towards the next campsite. The views were beautiful, evergreens leading to tall oaks and tall hills. There were nor more signs of screaming, human or bird. Before we got to the next site, I had all but forgotten about the whole ordeal. We went through the same movements as the night before setting up camp.\n\nWe were up later tonight than last night. We weren't as road fatigued. We had a nice roaring fire going by the time dusk set in. It seemed the raven decided to follow us. We began hearing its screams again in the close distance. Kim and I played with it for a few minutes, screaming back in reply. Once night fell, the bird settled in and became quiet as most birds do at night.\n\nThis morning, nothing woke me from my sleep. I stretched and emerged from my hammock. Right away I noticed Kim wasn't in hers. I figured she went to find a private place to do her business. I decided to stoke the dying embers from last night and wait for her. \n\nAlmost half an hour goes by before I realized Kim still had not returned. I was about to make my way more into the woods to begin my search fore her when the raven returned. It gave me a cockeyed look before letting out its human screech. I shooed it away, but it continued to follow me. Another scream greeted me as I pushed deeper into the brush. It was another raven. With a different human voice. I was a little unsettled hearing not one, but two birds screaming bloody murder at me. \n\nThe longer I walked trying to find Kim, the more ravens joined in with their terrible screams. Every single raven screamed a unique scream. Soon there were over thirty ravens circling above me, a cacophony of human-like distress.\n\nI came to a gathering of trees where another five or so birds were hunched and fighting over something on the ground. The ones trailing me made their descent onto the others. The shrill cries crescendo-ed to ear drum bursting levels. There was a flurry of black feather, claws, and bills as forty some birds fought over what was on the ground. A nearby deer caught sight of me, and darted off, cracking a branch in the process. The ravens, once fighting each other, now unanimously flew into the sky in reaction to the sudden sound. The place fell silent. Once the loose feathers settled, I was able to see what was on the ground. It was a human corpse. My initial reaction was to be sick, and so I was. The body looked to have been there for a few days at least. It was an obvious murder. Shaken, I stumbled backwards and felt a branch crack under my feet. Looking down proved to show it wasn't a branch, but a human skull, hidden lazily under the forest leaves. \n\nI was about to run when I heard the birds returning. Every single one of them screaming. I looked to the first body again. Its face was outstretched into the look of indescribable horror and pain. Like the person's last sound they made was a life pleading scream. Like the ravens' screams. Dozens of birds, screaming a different person's dying scream. I was frozen in terror when I heard another scream, from a familiar voice...Kim.",

        "text": "[I skipped class for the first time.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10t4mvt/how_to_survive_college_why_are_software_licenses/)  The professor doesn’t take attendance and I reached out to another classmate to get the notes, so I think it’ll be fine.\n\nI mean, he didn’t have notes because he *doesn’t take any* (I might take awful notes but at least I’m trying) but he confirmed the professor didn’t hand out the exam study sheet so I’m at least okay there.  I’ve had two exams in this class so far and he hands the study sheet out on random days and it is literally every topic and question that’s going to be on the exam so if you study off it, you’re guaranteed to pass.  I think he’s doing it like this because his class is so easy to skip and he’s sadistically trying to fail the students that don’t show up on the regular.\n\nYes, this is the professor that drones on about dinosaurs and puts everyone to sleep.\n\nAnyway, I made the bold choice to skip class that day because I was pretty sure if I walked into the classroom, I was going to die.\n\n  \n(if you’re new, [start here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/rnauck/how_to_survive_the_holidays/), and if you’re totally lost, [this might help](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/s75n1c/how_to_survive_college_index/))\n\nI was running late to class.  It wasn’t my fault, I always left the dorm room with plenty of time to spare because I’m just paranoid like that.  Look, I’ve sacrificed a lot to be here and maybe some of my classmates can afford to blow it off and not take it seriously, but I can’t.  I just can’t.  I’m on scholarship and if I lose that, there is *nothing* to fall back on.\n\nWell, except loans with exorbitant interest rates that’ll keep me in debt until I’m dead, I suppose.\n\nNot a great option!\n\nSo in the interests of not destroying my life so early into it, I’m Very Serious about attending class and being there on time.  Except this time, I was on my way to my dinosaur class when I heard someone yelling my name behind me.  At first I thought it was Grayson because it was a man’s voice and I guess I’m not very good at telling people’s voices apart.  I slowed and turned around and waited for him to catch up.  My class is at a popular class time, so the sidewalk was fairly crowded, and I didn’t get a close look at who it actually was until he was almost upon me.\n\nIt was Daniel.\n\nI hastily turned around again and kept walking.  I ducked my head and held onto the straps of my backpack as if that was some comfort, because I didn’t know what I should do.  Maria had said to not talk to him, but here he was, trying to catch up to me so we could… talk?  So he could yell at me?  I didn’t know and I didn’t want to find out.  I wanted to help him, I felt sorry for him, but I think… I’ve been listening to what you all have to say…\n\nI think I’m also kind of mad at him.\n\nHe could have apologized!  He’s had plenty of time to apologize!  And then I could have accepted it because he’s scared and we sometimes do stupid things when we’re scared and it all would have been *fine*.\n\n“You have to help me,” he gasped, coming up from behind and grabbing hold of my arm.\n\n“Maria is helping you, isn’t she?”\n\nI kept walking, pulling my arm out of his grasp.  He trailed along in my wake.  I wanted him to just *leave*.  I hadn’t told Maria about how I thought maybe we could transfer the scratching thing’s target because, well, you all put enough doubts in my head that I’m no longer sure.  Maybe I’m wrong about that.  Maybe it doesn’t take talking directly to the computer person, maybe it’s just *any* major distraction that’ll make someone a valid target.  And then there’s the people that said it's his trial and he should deal with it and I don’t know anymore.\n\nSo I was going to talk to Maria and see what she thought but he was *right here* and I didn’t know what to do yet.\n\n“Look!” he gasped.\n\nHe pulled his sleeve up and shoved his arm in front of my face.  I had to stop walking or I would have run right into it.  I backed away, averting my gaze, but it was too late.  I saw what he wanted me to see.  The long scratches running down the back of his arms, the band-aids covering where the nails bit deep enough to draw blood.\n\n“It hurts,” he said.  “I-I can’t do this anymore.”\n\n“I told you - you have to be the one to kill it.”\n\nI tried to keep going.  He grabbed a strap on my backpack and jerked backwards.  I didn’t expect it, so when the backpack went tight against my arms, pulling me back, I panicked.  My chest went tight and I thought of the flickering man, of how he grabbed me by the throat, and I just… shrugged out of my backpack.  I abandoned it to free myself and then I whirled around to stare at Daniel in disbelief.\n\nHe’d *grabbed* me.\n\n“I need your help,” he said.\n\nHis backpack was still clutched in his hand and he was making no move to offer it back to me.  I was breathing in short gasps and something was clawing its way free inside of me.  I felt like I was about to come apart at the seams.\n\n“I can’t,” I said stiffly.\n\n“Yes you can!” he cried.  “They told me you could!”\n\n*What the shit!?*\n\n“*Who* told you that?” I asked as evenly as I could manage.\n\nHe didn’t know, he said.  It was a note that was slipped under his door, a few days after our argument in the student union.  It said that I knew more than I was telling him.  Which… was true… but I wasn’t sure if it was meant in the way he’d taken it.  He knew everything that I did about the scratching.  But more importantly - who had sent it?  Who was *meddling*?  \n\nInhuman things were cryptic by nature, but a note under the door didn’t seem like their style.  Then again, this campus is a strange blend of old rules and new rules, so perhaps this *is* something they would do.  The laundry lady, perhaps?  If I did manage to stop the scratching, then that would surely piss the flickering man off even more and further her aims.\n\n“I’ve told you everything I know about the scratching in the hallway,” I said.  “Give me my backpack.”\n\nI held out my hand expectantly.  We were taking up too much space on the sidewalk, I realized.  People were having to uncomfortably step off into the grass to get around us, averting their eyes so that they wouldn't be pulled into our drama.  I wanted to get my things back and then leave as quickly as possible.\n\n“You know something else.  You have to,” he said desperately.\n\nI have a theory.  That’s all.  I couldn’t tell him this.  Instead, I just held out my hand in silence, waiting.\n\n“Don’t LIE to me, Ashley!” he screamed, clutching my backpack to his check with both arms.\n\nI flinched.  He was making a scene again.  I didn’t dare look around us.  I didn’t want to see people staring.\n\n“Fine,” I hissed, stepping in close to him in an attempt to get him to lower his voice.  “I might have an idea.  It’s more of a guess, really.  Can I have Maria set up a time for us to talk about it?”\n\nHe eyed me suspiciously, so I got out my phone and texted Maria right then and there so that he could see I wasn’t blowing him off.  I hastily put the phone away before she could respond, though.  That was enough to satisfy him.  He handed me my backpack and I threw it over my shoulders and hurried away.  He did not follow me.\n\nBy then I was only running a little bit late for class.  If I hurried, I’d make it perhaps only a minute late, which isn’t as late as some students show up so it should be fine.  Except as I walked, I felt that tightness in my chest wasn’t receding.  It was getting worse.\n\nI made it to the geology building and ducked into the restroom.  It was deserted, as class was starting, and the hallways were emptying.  I leaned on the counter and stared into the mirror, breathing heavily, trying not to cry.\n\nOkay, so, I guess I’m no longer okay with anyone trying to grab me.  We have the flickering man to thank for that.  But what the hell do I *do* about that?  I can’t afford to get all weepy and panicky like this.  And I didn’t feel *upset*, like it was more… I felt *angry.*  But my body wasn’t keeping up with my emotions.  It was off doing its own thing and I hated how it was making me feel underneath all that anger.\n\nIt took a bit to get my head back together.  By the time I’d stopped crying and was mostly composed enough to show my face in the classroom, I was nearly fifteen minutes late.  I could still slip in the back and the professor probably wouldn’t even notice, but I felt embarrassed to be walking into the classroom so late anyway.  I hurried down the hallway and only slowed my pace once I reached the end where the double doors led to the lecture hall.\n\nThere were roots on the floor.  They sprawled along the sides of the hallway and the space between them was covered in dust.  I kicked at it, overturning a layer to see if it was ashes.  It was not.  Just a fine layer of grayish sand.\n\nTentatively, I pulled the door open.  If there were giant insects crawling along the walls again, I was going to leave.  Otherwise, I’d just ignore the roots.  That’s what I told myself.\n\nThe lights in the room were off and the professor had started his lecture.  He stood with his back to me, gesturing at the presentation projected against the wall.  I didn’t want to make my way to my normal seat, as that would disturb too many students, so I looked for the nearest empty chair in the back.\n\nIt was occupied.  I almost stepped through the doorway to take the one next to it but something jarred my brain.  The student sitting there at the edge of my vision didn’t look… right.  So I took a moment to look at them properly.\n\nThey were hunched over the desk, crouched on the chair with their knees up against their chest.  Their arms were long and thin, crossed over each other, and its face was facing the front of the classroom.\n\nIts body was covered in bits of metal.  They glinted dully when they caught the scant light coming from the projector overhead.  At first I thought they were shards of glass, but it shifted slightly, and the pieces all swayed with its movement.  They were different sizes and different colors and they were attached to something - something that was driven through the student’s clothing and into its body.\n\nThe stabbed student.  The stabbed student was *in the classroom* and this time, it wasn’t covered in butter knives.\n\nIt’d been stabbed with keys.  They’d been driven all the way in and only the keychains remained, dangling from its flesh like little metal banners.\n\nI took a step backwards.  The door creaked as I did.\n\nIt swiveled its head around to stare at me.  A cluster of keychains swung from its eye sockets like wind chimes.\n\nNone of the other students had noticed its presence.  It was as far back as anyone could sit in the lecture hall and no one was turning around to look at a late student creeping in through the back.  Hell, perhaps no one was left *awake*.  The professor’s drone was nigh impossible to resist.\n\nBut I saw it and it saw me.\n\nIt slipped from the chair.  It began to crawl across the floor towards me.  Its body was slung close to the ground, the keychains hanging from its chest dragging along the carpet.  Its hands were splayed wide, the tendons rising and falling between the keys driven through the back of its hands and out through the palms.  I stood there, transfixed, unable to tear my eyes from the swaying keychains, as it inexorably inched closer.\n\nThen it paused.\n\nA thick tree root lay between me and it.  It hesitated, its hand hovering over it, and then it very carefully and very deliberately rose to its feet and tentatively stepped over the root.\n\nIt was refusing to touch them, I realized.  And in doing so, it was no longer looking at me, but at the ground to make sure no part of its body came into contact with the tree root.\n\nThat broke the hold my fear held over me.  I stumbled backwards, letting the door to the lecture hall fall shut, and then I turned to run.\n\nAnd almost ran straight into Professor L.\n\nHe’s the geology professor I had last year that doesn’t believe in monsters even though the one in the lecture hall apparently likes to *follow him around on the ceiling.*\n\nJust in case you needed a refresher.\n\n“Woah, hey, are you alright?” he asked, startled.  “I saw you standing there and was coming to ask if things were okay.”\n\nI can’t imagine how I looked to him, wide-eyed and panting.\n\n“S-sorry,” I stammered.  “I should go.”\n\n“Is this your class?  You are taking it this semester, aren’t you?”\n\n“I can’t go in there.”\n\nWhich was the worst excuse, I could have said anything else like I don’t know, my mom is trying to get a hold of me and it must be important because she never calls and that would have made sense but instead I said something stupid and his eyes narrowed in suspicion.\n\n“Are you… having problems with someone in the class?” he ventured.\n\nThere we go.  He gave me an out.  I nodded frantically, hoping that would be a good enough explanation for him and he’d let me out of this conversation.  The hair on the back of my neck was standing on edge because I could hear something fumbling at the door behind me.  There was the meaty clunk of the door handle engaging.\n\n“Do you want to sign up for counseling?  There’s resources for this sort of thing.  You shouldn’t have to miss class because of that,” he said.\n\nI told him it was nothing, really.  I was blowing something way out of proportion because I was tired.  Which wasn’t a lie, I… haven’t been sleeping well lately.  There’d just been a lot of pressure on me lately and a minor disagreement was getting out of hand.\n\n“I mean, you can still go to the counseling center for what feels like little stuff,” he said in exasperation.  “You don’t have to be in the middle of a crisis to get help.”\n\nBehind me the door began to creak open.  I heard a jingle, the sort of noise you hear when you pull your keys out of your pocket.\n\n“C’mon, we’ll go back to my office and get you signed up,” he offered helpfully.\n\n“Sure,” I said desperately.  “Let’s do that.”\n\nAnything to get out of there.  He started walking towards the offices and I anxiously followed, casting nervous glances behind me the entire way.\n\nThe door was open a foot.  The creature’s hand was curled around it and its face was pushed through the opening.  It watched me with empty eyes, the keys sprouting from its body shining with blood in the fluorescent lights.\n\nI followed Professor L. to his office and sat there miserably while he pulled open the counseling center’s website and then when he asked me what times I had free, that was when I told him I wasn’t sure about all of this and I’d rather not.\n\nUgh I know everyone in the comments is going to say I should have taken him up on it or that I should have done that long ago instead of saying I would and then not actually doing it, but look, I’m busy, I don’t know if I’ll have time for it and also like wtf do I even tell them???  Oh nbd I’m just dealing with *literal monsters that want to kill me*?\n\nHe said some things, trying to talk me into it I’m sure, but I wasn’t really listening.\n\nI was staring at the tree root that lay across his desk.\n\nBecause I was certain that it was intersecting with the paperweight I’d seen last time I was in here, except it looked so natural, like the chunk of rock sitting on the corner of his desk had been a part of the root all along.\n\n“Sure, that’s fine,” I said automatically when he paused to wait for my response.  “What’s that?”\n\nI pointed at the paperweight.  He reached over and picked it up.  It left behind a hollow spot in the root.\n\n“I found it in the graveyard on campus, of all places,” he said.  “Here.  Take a look.”\n\nHe handed it to me.  By now I’ve sat through enough tedious lectures to be able to recognize petrified wood when I was holding it.\n\n“I thought it looked like a heart,” he continued.\n\nI stared at it for a moment while he waited expectantly.  It was somewhat rounded and had a slight ridge in the middle, but that was the extent of the heart resemblance in my mind.\n\n“Maybe if you squint,” I finally said.\n\n“I know,” he laughed.  “But I was trying to figure out how to propose to my wife at the time and I thought that a heart-shaped piece of petrified wood would be romantic.  Then I realized how stupid the idea was and bought her a ring like a normal person.  Anyway, I’ve kept it for good luck, I guess.”\n\nI set it back on the desk, back into the recess in the root, exactly as I’d found it.  I knew better than to leave things like that disturbed.  \n\n“Do you think it works?” I asked.  “As a good luck charm, that is.”\n\n“Well I’m the only person in this building that hasn’t run into ghosts,” he smirked.  “Would you believe that Professor M. says he saw something that looked like a person covered in syringes?  Like they’d been stabbed to death with them.  Pretty gruesome, huh?”\n\n“Yeah,” I agreed.  “That’s… wild.”\n\nIt’s not invisible to the professors.  That stabbed student is really in here and other people have seen it.  But not him.  Not when it was right above him.\n\n*I need a piece of that petrified wood.*[\\[x\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)\n\n[Read the first draft of the rules.](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/t34mbv/how_to_survive_college/)\n\n[Visit the college's website.](https://alderrayne.com/)",

        "text": "I can still hear that noise.\n\nI had never given much thought to the idea of ghosts and supernatural beings, until I met her. She was tall and thin, with a face that seemed to go on forever. Her limbs were long and slender, and her movements were so unnatural, I was sure she wasn't human. I had no idea who she was or what she wanted from me, but she haunted me every single night.\n\nIt all started innocently enough. I would wake up in the middle of the night to find her standing at the foot of my bed, just watching me. I initially thought it was just a nightmare, but it soon became a terrifying reality. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't scream. I was paralyzed with fear.\n\nBut then she started moving, contorting her body in ways that were beyond humanly possible. Her arms twisted and bent in unnatural angles, and her legs bent backwards. I could hear bones breaking and snapping as she moved, and I felt my own bones ache in sympathy. She seemed to enjoy the pain, her twisted smile spreading as she continued her movements.\n\nOne night, she was right next to my bed, her long face inches from mine. I could smell her rancid breath as she whispered, \"I want to scare you.\" Her words sent chills down my spine and I knew I was in big trouble.\n\nI tried to leave my house, but I couldn't find the door. It was as if she had trapped me there and I was at her mercy. My nightmares became even more vivid and frequent, and I would wake up to find her contorting her body in front of me. I couldn't take it anymore, and I sought out help from a specialist, but nothing worked.\n\nThe specialist told me that she was a vengeful spirit, seeking to scare those she deemed deserving. She had attached herself to me and I couldn't get rid of her on my own. The ritual he performed to banish her only made her stronger.\n\nI was at my wit's end and felt like I was losing my mind. I couldn't escape her, and I couldn't get rid of her. She was always there, contorting her body in front of me, breaking her own bones to scare me. I was trapped in a never-ending nightmare, and I didn't know how to escape.\n\nOne night, she reached out to grab me. I screamed and ran, but she was always there, always watching me, always breaking her bones to scare me. I was never going to be free of her, and I knew I was going to be scared for the rest of my life. The crunching sound of her breaking bones still echoed in my mind, a constant reminder of my endless terror. But then one morning, I woke up to a completely different reality. The woman was nowhere to be seen and the terrorizing nightmare had finally ended. I cautiously made my way over to the bed and found her imprint still fresh in the sheets, and a residue of grime left behind.\n\nI was both relieved and frightened at the same time. Was this just a dream or was she really that powerful that she could leave an imprint and grime behind? I decided to leave the house, to get away from her haunting presence and start anew.\n\nYears have passed and I have never seen or heard from her again. But the memory of her still haunts me, the crunching sound of her bones and the feeling of terror I felt whenever she was near. I know she will always be a part of me, but I am grateful that she no longer haunts my nights.",

I don't know what the hell she was.\n\n All I knew was that despite her short, petite body, she was strong, fast, and ruthless. \n\nShe scared her cellmates, brutally attacked guards and prisoners, and tried to go after us before being shot and presumably killed.\n\nThe thing that made her more terrifying was her constant joyous smile.\n\n And the one time she didn't smile was when I stopped a younger, weaker inmate from hanging with her. \n\nNot that it mattered, because that poor girl had her head ripped off.\n\nThat bitch is the reason I am now an amputee with a prosthetic leg and why my wife is now missing an ear.\n\nWe thought she died when an officer shot her. But her body disappeared from the morgue and some strange occurrences happened in the area.\n\nOne day, we heard a knock at the door. I answered and it was an officer. The officer was male and fairly chubby with a mustache that looked like a caterpillar.\n\n\"Are you Carrie and Roxanne King?\" He asked.\n\n\"Yes. Can I help you?\"\n\n\"I just need your help with something. I picked up a case that you and your wife might know about.\"\n\nI nodded and let him in.\n\n\"Roxy!\" I called. \"We have a guest!\"\n\n\"I'll be there soon! Just gotta put Joey down for a nap!\" Roxanne called from a different room.\n\nRoxanne came in and we all sat down.\n\n\"So, I was told you both have a connection with some woman named Judith, is that right?\"\n\nI could see Roxanne's dark eyes widen and gritting her teeth. I held her hand to comfort her.\n\n\"Yes. She killed everyone in the Metropolitan Correction's Center and is why I have a prosthetic and why my wife has one ear.\" \n\nThe officer wrote it down. \"Well, the reason I asked is that whenever we searched the prison and heard her body disappeared. We found this journal under her mattress. I figured we all look through this. You two and Officer Rains were the only survivors and I'm sure you have had questions about her.\"\n\nI looked at Roxanne. She squeezed my hand and seemed hesitant. She took a deep breath and exhaled. \n\n\"Might as well. I didn't lose an ear for nothin'.\"\n\nThe diary itself didn't look like it belonged to a young woman. It was all pink and frilly and had a lock on it. I recognized the brand as a Totomi journal because my little sister had the same brand as Judith. But my sister was 10 and Judith had to have been at least 19 to 25 years old.\n\n\"Anyone know how to pick a lock? We couldn't find the key to this thing.\"\n\nRoxanne smiled and got up. She came back with a screwdriver small enough to fit in the keyhole. She jiggled it until it opened.\n\nThe officer opened it and this is what it read on the first entry.\n\nJanuary 1st, 2003\n\nI was made today. I could see everyone around me in white clothes with writing thingies. Everyone keeps touching me and asking me questions that don't make sense.\n\nJanuary 14th 2003\n\nI was told to pick up a big rock and throw it. I picked it up and it felt like holding a bunch of grapes. I threw it with no effort and it broke.\n\nFebruary 14th, 2003\n\nOne of the white clothes people fixed my face so I had more emotions. I really liked being able to smile, so I do it all the time. But everyone seems to fear it.\n\nI don't understand. I thought people liked smiles?\n\nMarch 27th 2003\n\nThe people are so confusing. They want me to be strong and fast, but when I am strong and fast, they get angry.\n\nI threw one of the people into the wall after he yelled at me for destroying a door by running into it. I saw his head bleed a crimson liquid much like mine. \n\nBut he never came back nor did he repair the injury.\n\nThe wording was weird here. Judith barely sounded like a person. More like a child or someone who was literally born yesterday.\n\nWe kept reading.\n\nAugust 17th, 2003\n\nMy intelligence increased a lot. The scientists put me through tests all the time. How strong am I? How fast can I run? How smart am I? \n\nThe more I'm around everyone, I realize how different I am. \n\nThey eat much like me, but I don't produce waste.\n\nWhen they are hurt, they don't just fix it immediately.\n\nThey have these things called genitalia between their legs when I don't and have babies.\n\nThey are also weak and slow compared to me. \n\nWhat am I?\n\nOctober 31st, 2003\n\nI want to go out. But no one lets me.\n\nThey say I am not ready. But, I am strong and brave.\n\nI see people outside my window go out and have fun while I am stuck inside having to do these stupid, stupid tests!\n\nI am a person! I am a person! I am a person!\n\n\nThe most we gleaned from this is that Judith isn't a normal human if she is one at all. But, we wouldn't know unless we kept reading.\n\nDecember 28th, 2003\n\nI hate it here. I hate my cell. I hate scientists. I hate the constant tests. I hate being poked and prodded and asked a bunch of questions! \n\nI hate everyone and everything in this garbage facility!\n\nAfter that, most of the pages had some damage on it that made everything ineligible. But, we got to the one that piqued our interest.\n\nJune 13th, 2007\n\nI broke everyone. Everyone is gone. I'm alone. I'm free.\n\nJune 24th, 2007\n\nI was taken away to another prison. No one ever questioned my humanity. Not at all.\n\nI was across from two ladies who were both very pretty. One was tan with short black hair and wore a white top and the other had brown skin with long beautiful braids. \n\nI told them I was named Judith since I had no name.\n\nI was fixated on them. I wanted to be friends.\n\nJune 25th, 2007\n\nMy cellmate wouldn't stop bothering me last night. She kept asking dumb questions. \n\nI learned that she had been arrested for robbery.\n\nI told her that her robbery was because she was a pathetic waste of space that thinks that stealing from others will fill some sort of need within her.\n\nShe made strange noises and water came from her eyes. I recognized it as crying, but I didn't care because she wouldn't stop asking me stupid questions.\n\nShe was moved and a big woman came in to have a talk with me. She also kept asking me a bunch of stupid questions, so I jumped on her and pulled out her eye.\n\nI showed the two pretty girls the eye to impress them. They didn't smile.\n\nMe and Roxanne looked at each other. Judith actually liked us.\n\nJune 30th, 2007\n\nEveryone is scared of me. \n\nNo one wants to be around me. But, I like to look at the two pretty ladies in the cell across from me. \n\nI see them cuddle and hold each other's hands. \n\nThey liked each other, but not me. What did I do?\n\nJuly 3rd, 2007\n\nI hate them. I hate them I hate them I hate them I hate them\nI hate them I hate them I hate them I hate them\nI hate them. I hate them I hate them I hate them I hate them\nI hate them I hate them I hate them I hate them\n\nI tried to make a new friend but the short haired lady took her away. And then I thought my new friend just walked away.\n\n\nI hate them. I hate them I hate them I hate them I hate them\nI hate them I hate them I hate them I hate them\nI hate them. I hate them I hate them I hate them I hate them\nI hate them I hate them I hate them I hate them\n\nI hate them all. I want to break them all.\n\nThat was all that was in the diary. Me and Roxanne didn't know what to think. \n\n\"Oh my god….\" I mouthed.\n\nThe officer closed it. \"This goes deeper than any case I had. And I have dealt with worse. Which is why I want your help with finding her.\"\n\n\"Sir, may we be excused?\" Roxanne asked.\n\nThe officer nodded and let us discuss it.\n\n\"Carrie. I don't know about this.\"\n\n\"Roxy, I think it might be best for us to at least help. Judith could be out there and I don't want her hurting more people. That wouldn't be good for my conscience.\"\n\n\"Carrie! That monster ripped your leg off! I don't want her to hurt you more!\"\n\nI held Roxanne's hand. \"If we took her out the first time, we can take her out again. We got this.\"\n\nRoxanne seemed more relaxed and smiled. \"Okay. I'll stay with Joey.\"\n\nMe and the officer left the house and drove to the morgue where Judith's body was last seen.\n\nWe looked around for clues both in and out of the morgue. Nothing inside stood out, but outside is where things got interesting.\n\nWe found a knife that had blood that had since dried. The officer put the knife in the evidence bag.\n\nWe went to the station to see if anything about it leads to anything. The knife had fingerprints that belong to Judith, but the blood doesn't appear to be normal blood. Infact, it doesn't seem to be blood at all. It doesn't belong to anyone.\n\nWe both went outside so I could be taken home. \n\nAs we walked, I felt a familiar sense of dread.\n\nBehind me, I heard the officer scream and then the sounds of flesh and bones being torn.\n\nI turned around and felt my blood run cold.\n\nJudith was standing there with the officer ripped in half vertically, but she changed entirely.\n\nHer once strawberry blonde hair became completely white, her emerald eyes bloodshot, and worst of all; she now had a glasgow grin that made her mouth wider. She hasn't aged a day and now wore a white dress now stained with red.\n\n\"Miss me, Carrie?\" Judith asked. \n\nShe no longer had that happy voice. She was now coldhearted and empty like a lake.\n\n\"What the fuck-? How are you alive?\"\n\n\"SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!\" Judith roared. \"STOP ASKING ME SUCH RIDICULOUS QUESTIONS!!!!\"\n\nI ran to the car and jumped in. Judith didn't move, instead she gave a little smile. Unlike before, the smile was smug.\n\nI drove home and ran inside. I was horrified by what I saw.\n\nI saw the house was trashed and Roxanne wrapping her arm with gauze. It was bleeding. Next to her was a knife with blood.\n\n\"Roxy! Are you okay!?\"\n\n\"I'm fine.\" Roxanne grunted. \"But we have bigger issues.\"\n\n\"What?! Where's Joey?\" I asked, now worried.\n\nI saw Roxanne tear up. \"Judith. That bitch took Joey.\"\n\nI fell to my knees. I couldn't believe what I heard.\n\nAfter a moment of disbelief, I was now full of ungodly amounts of rage. The kind any mother would have if someone stole your kid.\n\n\"Roxy. Get the gun.\"\n\nRoxanne nodded and got up.\n\nAs soon as she got the gun, we drove to where we last saw Judith.\n\nWe looked around and asked questions if they saw a white haired woman in a white stained dress had been seen anywhere.\n\nWe got some information from an old lady who claimed to have seen a woman with the exact description with our son walking inside an abandoned building.\n\nI got the address and we drove to the location. We walked in ready to shoot Judith for taking our son for whatever reason.\n\nAs we walked, we saw a glimpse into Judith's mind. On the walls were newspaper clippings and images of us with tears, rips, and sharp objects stabbed in them.\n\nRoxanne got ahead of me and looked behind a corner. She stopped me and we peeked in.\n\nInside was a room decorated with pink walls, furniture, and stuffed animals. We saw Judith with Joey who was still asleep. She cradled him and swayed him, humming 'Hush Little Baby' to him as she did.\n\nI felt sick watching her do this. That was our son! She took him away from us and for what!?\n\nMe and Roxanned looked to each other for a plan to get Joey out of there safely.\n\nWe moved away from the corner and discussed the plan.\n\nRoxanne looked around and saw a brick. She picked it up and threw it away from the opening to the room to the foyer as far as she could with a loud clatter.\n\nWe waited for Judith to walk out and investigate. She walked out.\n\nWe waited until she was out far enough for us to get in and get Joey.\n\nI decided to keep watch and while Roxanne got Joey. She handed me the gun to defend myself with.\n\nI held the gun, ready to blow that wide mouthed bitch's brains out for hurting my wife and stealing my kid.\n\nRoxanne came out with Joey who was now awake.\n\n\"Mama Rox? Where are we?\" Joey asked, rubbing his eyes in confusion.\n\n\"It's okay, Joey Roo.\" Roxanne said quietly. \"We just got in some trouble. We'll be home soon.\"\n\nI heard Judith yell. \"Who's there!?\" \n\n\"Go, Roxy! I'll take her out!\" I instructed quietly.\n\nRoxanne ran out with Joey through a fire escape.\n\nJudith walked back and saw me. \"Oh, hello Carrie. Wasn't Roxy here?\"\n\n\"Shut up! Only I call her Roxy! You stole my son!\"\n\nJudith snickered. \"I just wanted to play with him. Am I not allowed to be Aunt Judith?\" \n\n\"You were never allowed to be Aunt Judith! I never wanted you to be Aunt Judith! We are not friends and never will be! You killed people, hurt my wife twice, and made me an amputee! You traumatized me!\"\n\nJudith cocked her head, as if what I said confused her. Her expression looked a bit sad.\n\nThen it turned to anger.\n\nShe ran towards me. I shot at her feet which slowed her down enough for me to get a good distance from her.\n\nI ran back a bit. I saw her basically crawl towards me like a spider.\n\n\"You! You! You! I hate you!!!\" Judith screamed like a petulant child.\n\nShe jumped on me and pinned me down. Judith twisted the gun out of my hand and threw it.\n\n\"Fuck. You.\" I strained out.\n\nJudith didn't say anything. \n\nShe raised her hand and balled it into a fist.\n\nI braced myself for what she would do. \n\nThen I heard gunshots and Judith screaming.\n\nI opened my eyes to see Judith with bullet holes in her chest. I looked to see Roxanne with the gun, shaking and panting. I pulled myself away and Judith fell on her back.\n\nI ran to Roxanne and hugged her. \n\nJudith was groaning. We both walked to her and looked down.\n\nJudith was spitting up blood and had tears in her eyes. \"I….J-just…Wanted…t-to be..Your…F-f-friends….\"\n\nI held out my hand and Roxanne handed me the gun. I aimed it at her forehead and shot her. Her eyes rolled back and they closed.\n\n\"Roxy, where's Joey?\"\n\nRoxy guided me to a room where Joey was sitting there watching cartoons on his tablet with headphones.\n\nI smiled. \"I'll take care of her.\"\n\nI picked up Judith's body and put her in my car. I grabbed some ropes, chains, a sheet, and bricks.\n\nI knew that Judith might come back, so might as well try to slow her down.\n\nWhen I got home, I wrapped her in the sheet, tied her up, and chained her to the bricks.\n\nI drove to the Hudson River and tossed her in.\n\nI drove home, relieved that I might never have to deal with Judith for a while. As I drove, I thought of her entries and her words.\n\n In some way, I pity her. \n\nIf she didn't grow up in that environment, she might have been different. She could have been a very sweet person if she had a loving environment.\n\n The way she talked and acted seemed more like the thoughts of a naive, albeit violent and angry child.\n\nI get it, I grew up as a very angry child of abuse. It's one of the reasons I got into drugs and ended up in jail.\n\nBut, it obviously doesn't excuse what she did.\n\nEverything's been normal after that event. \n\nBut, we have been staying prepared for Judith so that if she comes back, we'll be ready to do it all again.",

We sat next to one another in 7th grade Marine Bio.\r\n\r\nWe had to dissect a fish together. I don’t remember what species of fish it had been, only that it stank so badly that I swayed in my seat and nearly passed out.\r\n\r\nCaleb noticed and immediately took the scalpel from me, ignoring my protests.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got this,” he said. “You can take the notes.”\r\n\r\nAnd he cut the fish open by himself while I jotted down the notes.\r\n\r\nWe became friends after that. There’s something about eviscerating a dead fish that brings you together.\r\n\r\nCaleb introduced me to Beck. Caleb held Beck’s hand as she came out to their father, and Caleb took us around town to uncover its secrets.\r\n\r\nAnd now Caleb was dead.\r\n\r\nBeck wailed over his body, and Madeline vomited into a bush.\r\n\r\nI was distraught, and I was angry. I was angry at myself because I was thinking about the possibility of us being stuck here when I should have been focusing on the death of one of my best friends.\r\n\r\nBut I couldn’t help it.\r\n\r\nIf Caleb had been the only one who knew how to get out, we were screwed beyond screwed.\r\n\r\nEzra crouched over Beck, rubbed her back, and talked soothingly. I couldn’t hear what he was saying, but whatever it was worked. He helped Beck to her feet and wrapped her in a hug. As she walked towards me, Ezra took off his jacket and gently placed it over Caleb’s face.\r\n\r\nI embraced Beck, and she began to cry again. Her body shook with sobs, and I didn’t know what to say so I just held her.\r\n\r\nEventually her tears subsided and she pushed away from me. She stared at the sky with red eyes, her tears left tracks on her cheeks.\r\n\r\nEzra stood by Madeline, who had stopped throwing up. He reached to take her hand, and she recoiled from his touch.\r\n\r\nHer hands curled into fists, and she marched towards us, and before I could do anything, she slapped Beck and raised her hand to do it again.\r\n\r\nI jumped between them, and Ezra grabbed Madeline and held her back. Madeline screeched and clawed at the air like a cat.\r\n\r\nBeck didn’t react. She kept staring at the sky, her cheek bright red.\r\n\r\n“Let me go!” Madeline screamed. “Let me go, Ezra! It’s her fault that Caleb is dead! It’s all her fault.”\r\n\r\n“It’s not her fault!” I yelled angrily. “How dare you! This isn’t her fault at all!”\r\n\r\nThat angered her even more, and she lunged at me. Ezra was lean and tall while Madeline was petite, he easily pulled her away.\r\n\r\n“Cut it out, Maddy.” He said sharply. “I know you’re hurting; we all are, but it isn’t Beck’s fault.”\r\n\r\nMadeline laughed, it was cruel and ugly. “How is it not her fault? She fought with him, and he fell! She did it.”\r\n\r\n“She did not,” Ezra said sadly. “He tripped and fell. We saw it.”\r\n\r\n“He wouldn’t have tripped if they hadn’t fought! He would be okay - he would still be here and not dead!”\r\n\r\nShe crumpled to the ground, sobbing, and Ezra hugged her.\r\n\r\nI was grateful that he was here. He was the calm voice of reason amidst tragedy. I don’t know how he did it, but he must have had a lot of practice dealing with hysterics with Madeline as a sister.\r\n\r\n“Do you think Caleb would want you blaming his twin?” I heard him mutter to Madeline.\r\n\r\n“It is my fault,” a small voice said to my left.\r\n\r\nBeck.\r\n\r\nI turned to her and grabbed her hands.\r\n\r\n“It’s not your fault,” I said firmly. “It’s not your fault at all, Beck.”\r\n\r\nShe wouldn’t look at me.\r\n\r\n“But it is,” she whispered. “My brother is gone just like mom. They’re both gone.”\r\n\r\nI didn’t know what to say to that, so I drew her to me again.\r\n\r\nShe wrapped her arms around me, and over her shoulder, I looked at Caleb’s still body, Ezra’s jacket a shroud over his face.\r\n\r\n❧\r\n\r\n“How are we going to get out?” Ezra said. He was looking at the thicket of trees we had come from.\r\n\r\nMadeline rolled her eyes. “Do you really think we’re stuck here? As if Caleb had some secret powers that led us here? It’s a trick, you guys, a joke. We get back by walking out of here, of course.”\r\n\r\nEzra looked dubious, and while I hoped she was right, from what we had been experiencing, I didn’t think it was that simple.\r\n\r\nMadeline looked at us and rolled her eyes again. “You guys are such pussies. Watch.”\r\n\r\nShe stomped towards the trees, and her confidence gave me hope.\r\n\r\nMaybe she’s right, I thought. Perhaps it was just a joke. We’ll be okay; we’ll get out.\r\n\r\nAnd then she stopped abruptly.\r\n\r\n“What the fuck?” She muttered.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” Ezra said; he walked over to her. She said nothing, and my curiosity got the better of me.\r\n\r\n“Come on,” I said to Beck, who was sitting on the ground, staring at Caleb’s body\r\n\r\n“Let’s see what’s going on.” Hesitantly, she took my hand, and I helped her up. We had nearly reached Madeline and Ezra when Ezra shouted,\r\n\r\n“Madeline, stop!”\r\n\r\nAnd then there was the sound of something sizzling, the smell of burning, and Madeline’s scream ripped through the air. She fell to the ground, gripping her hand.\r\n\r\nWe ran toward them, and Ezra shot out his arm to prevent us from going further. He looked sick.\r\n\r\n“Don’t. Don’t go any farther.”\r\n\r\n“What is that?” I asked. The air in front of us was rippling, shimmering like sunlight reflecting on water. It was beautiful. Gorgeous. Entranced, I reached out to touch it. Ezra grabbed my hand and held it.\r\n\r\n“Don’t,” he said, voice tight.\r\n\r\nMadeline was still holding her hand, howling.\r\n\r\nI spotted something on the ground. It was small and shaped like an eraser on a pencil. I frowned and picked it up and then dropped it in disgust.\r\n\r\nIt was the tip of a finger with a melted pink acrylic nail attached to it.\r\n\r\nThe smell of burning flesh was so strong, and when I looked at Madeline’s hand, I retched.\r\n\r\nThe tip of her pointer finger was gone, but there was no blood. The wound was smooth and looked as though it had been cauterized.\r\n\r\nI looked at that invisible shimmering wall. It had sliced Madeline’s finger off.\r\n\r\nBeck’s face was expressionless. She picked the nub of Madeline’s finger up off the ground and rotated it slowly, mildly interested.\r\n\r\n“There’s like a force field here,” Ezra said, gesturing at it. “Like a barrier. I don’t think we can leave this way.”\r\n\r\n“Are you okay? Does it hurt?” I asked Madeline. She looked up at me, tears in her eyes.\r\n\r\n“No, it doesn’t hurt. It did at first. It hurt a lot.” She flexed her hand and inspected it. “This is so weird.”\r\n\r\n“That’s good,” I said. “I’m glad it doesn’t hurt.”\r\n\r\nI turned to Beck and Ezra, who examined the barrier, careful not to touch it. Ezra gingerly poked it with a stick he had found and jumped back as it caught on fire.\r\n\r\n“Beck?” I said.\r\n\r\n“Hm?” she replied distractedly.\r\n\r\n“Are you sure there was nothing in Caleb’s notebook? Like positively sure?”\r\n\r\nHer face scrunched up.\r\n\r\n“I’m not sure,” she admitted. “I mean, there could have been something I missed.”\r\n\r\n“We should look at it,” I said. “There might be something in it that could help us.”\r\n\r\nBeck nodded. Her eyes were still red, but I saw the determination in them and the way she set her jaw.\r\n\r\n “I think I threw it over there.” She said and pointed towards the cemetery. “It-“\r\n\r\nHer words were cut off by her sudden gasp. Her eyes went wide with terror and her entire body began to shake.\r\n\r\nI whipped my head around so fast my neck cracked. I froze, and my heart pounded in my chest.\r\n\r\nThe door to the church was wide open, and a figure stood at its entrance.\r\n\r\nThe figure was tall and as white as a ghost. It bent at the waist and stood crookedly to one side, as though its back were broken.\r\n\r\nThe darkness that flooded out of the doorway especially pronounced its whiteness.\r\n\r\nIt had wild white hair and wore a shaggy white robe. Its face was the color of chalk, and it’s lips were bright red with a smile that stretched from ear to ear. The smile revealed rows and rows of sharp white teeth.\r\n\r\nI couldn’t breathe. It was as though the air had been sucked out and replaced with this drowning feeling. My lungs wouldn’t expand. I am going to suffocate; I thought.\r\n\r\n“What is that?” I said when I could breathe again.\r\n\r\n“It’s The Witch,” Beck breathed. “The Witch, it’s her.”\r\n\r\nEzra had gone very still, and Madeline was breathing so hard that I thought she would pass out.\r\n\r\nIt’s The Witch, I thought. The Witch, she’s real.\r\n\r\nThe Witch, The Witch, The Witch.\r\n\r\nBeck’s scream crashed through my thoughts.\r\n\r\n“She’s got him! She’s got him!” She pointed at the church, hysterical. “Caleb! Caleb!”\r\n\r\nCaleb’s body was lying at The Witch’s feet, Ezra’s jacket wrapped around his neck like a noose.\r\n\r\nThe Witch stared at us, still smiling crookedly. Her long tongue ran over pointy teeth, leaving a smear of something dark red.\r\n\r\nBlood.\r\n\r\nShe raised a long finger and bent it in a come hither motion. Caleb’s body turned right side up, standing.\r\n\r\nHis head flopped to the side like a rag doll; and when The Witch bent her finger again, his body slowly began to turn and twist. His joints broke one by one.\r\n\r\nHis spine snapped, his hips popped, and his ribs cracked.\r\n\r\n“Stop!” Beck screamed. “Please stop!”\r\n\r\nBut his body kept twisting, kept turning, kept breaking, and then\r\n\r\nIt stopped and Caleb’s body was as crooked as The Witch’s; contorted beyond recognition.\r\n\r\nThe wind kicked up and showered us in dirt and through slitted eyes, I saw that The Witch was still staring at us.\r\n\r\nAnd then I heard her. Her voice sounded like broken glass had shredded her throat. A croak punctuated each word.\r\n\r\nIt was as though she were speaking directly into my ear.\r\n\r\n“You will not leave,” she rasped. “You are mine. You are mine. You will not go.”\r\n\r\nMy bladder let go. I pissed myself, and warm pee trickled down my leg.\r\n\r\nAnd then she and Caleb were gone, as if they had disappeared with the wind.\r\n\r\nThe church’s door slammed closed, and The Witch left us numb and terrified in her wake.\r\n\r\n❧\r\n\r\nBeck threw herself at the door, Ezra and I right behind her.\r\n\r\n“Caleb!” she screamed, pounding on it. “Caleb! Caleb, please!”\r\n\r\nEzra and I looked at one another. He shrugged and grabbed the door handle, twisting and shaking but it didn’t budge.\r\n\r\nBeck was still screaming; she was hysterical. Her laughter was piercing and wild, and her eyes rolled in her head.\r\n\r\nSo many terrible things had happened, but this scared me the most. She was having a mental break and slipping into insanity.\r\n\r\nShe’s losing it, I thought. She’s losing it, and who could blame her?\r\n\r\nBeck kept laughing and crying, laughing and crying. Intervals of madness. She was losing her sanity, and I didn’t know what to say or do.\r\n\r\nSomething shoved me hard, and I nearly fell over.\r\n\r\n“Move,” Madeline snarled, and without hesitation, she slapped Beck hard across the face.\r\n\r\nBeck stopped laughing and stared at her, dazed. Madeline smacked her again. She grabbed her shirt collar and pulled her close.\r\n\r\n“Get it the fuck together, Rebecka.” She snarled. “For you, for Caleb, for all of us! There’s enough shit we have to deal with it, so get it together.”\r\n\r\nShe slapped her once more, and I winced.\r\n\r\nOverkill, I thought.\r\n\r\nBut Beck’s eyes were bright and clear now.\r\n\r\nI never thought I would be grateful for Madeline.\r\n\r\nThere was an awkward silence that hung in the air.\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” Beck said quietly, rubbing her cheek. “Thanks, Maddy.”\r\n\r\nMadeline smiled at her. “You’re welcome, Beck.”\r\n\r\n“How’s your finger, Maddy?” Ezra asked dryly.\r\n\r\nMadeline flipped him off. “This one is perfect.”\r\n\r\n❧\r\n\r\nThe sun was setting, and the horizon burned.\r\n\r\nI walked in its orange light and looked for the notebook while Ezra and Beck tried to open the door. Madeline sat on the crumbling steps examining her hand.\r\n\r\n“It’s like it’s cemented shut,” Beck groaned as they pushed all their weight on it.\r\n\r\nThe notebook was near where Caleb had snapped his neck, on top of the memorial plaque. I stepped around the headstones gingerly and picked the notebook up. I paused and frowned as I read the plaque’s engraved inscription.\r\n\r\nIt said:\r\n\r\nBaby\r\n\r\n000000 - 000000\r\n\r\nAnd underneath that was a crude drawing of a stork.\r\n\r\nCaleb’s words from earlier ran through my head.\r\n\r\n“The trees! I figured out that you have to trust the trees. And then the crows follow them, but not the bats; the bats are liars. And the grave! The baby’s grave. It’s there; it’s all there.\r\n\r\nBefore I could stop myself, I brushed the epigraph with my fingers, and the words began to glow red.\r\n\r\nCrouching over the grave, I looked through the notebook carefully. It was blank, just as Beck had said. But as I reached the end, I spotted a litany of words written on the bottom right of the page in Caleb’s neat script.\r\n\r\nthe bell\r\n\r\ndirt\r\n\r\ndrown\r\n\r\nburial\r\n\r\nsacrifice\r\n\r\nNot much, but it was something.\r\n\r\nI closed the notebook.\r\n\r\n“Guys?” I called. They stopped what they were doing and hurried over to me.\r\n\r\nTheir faces glowed as they stood in front of the headstone.\r\n\r\n“What is this?” Beck asked. She bent to read the inscription and then looked up at me.\r\n\r\n“The baby’s grave….”\r\n\r\nI nodded. “Yup, the one he talked about.”\r\n\r\n“Why is it glowing?” Ezra asked. He looked unnerved.\r\n\r\n“I touched it,” I admitted. “I touched it, and it just started doing this. I also found this.”\r\n\r\nI showed them what Caleb had written.\r\n\r\nBeck rolled her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Of course, so cryptic he can’t write full sentences.”\r\n\r\n“So, we have to get to the bell,” Madeline said. She was looking up at the steeple, doubt all over her face. “Easier said than done.”\r\n\r\nThe walls of the church were smooth despite its dilapidated state. There would be no way to climb it to reach the bell. It wasn’t a particularly tall building, but if you fell, it would hurt.\r\n\r\n“Looks like it,” Ezra said. He was still looking at the glowing grave. “But we have to get in somehow, and I don’t think the door is how. Maybe…” He trailed off.\r\n\r\n“Maybe?” I prompted.\r\n\r\n“Maybe we’re not meant to get in that way.” He gestured towards the church door.\r\n\r\nHe walked around the expanse of the cemetery and eventually crouched in front of a small white one.\r\n\r\nHe paused and pressed his hand onto it. Underneath his palm, it glowed an ethereal shade of gold.\r\n\r\nHe looked over at us. “This one says Child, but with sixes instead of zeros. And there’s a drawing of a face.” He looked sick. “A face with eyes but no mouth. I’m guessing the numbers are the ages they died.” He frowned. “But what does any of this mean?”\r\n\r\n“I have no idea,” I said; I looked around, and another grave caught my eye. It was in much better condition than the others. It looked brand new.\r\n\r\nMy heart was beating fast, and it leaped into my throat as I read the epigraph.\r\n\r\nSomebody died in the creek, you know - a young boy.\r\n\r\nThat boy had been my friend. He had lived next door, but when he died, his family had moved away.\r\n\r\nIt had been years since it happened, and nobody talked about it. Nothing was exciting or mysterious about his death. A young boy had drowned. Case closed.\r\n\r\nJust an ordinary tragedy in an average town. It happens all the time.\r\n\r\nI had seen the police carry his body out of the woods, and I had gone to the funeral with my parents and brothers.\r\n\r\nWe hadn’t gone to the cemetery afterward because, as my mom told me, his parents had him burned so he could always be with them, no matter where they went.\r\n\r\nSo why was his headstone here?\r\n\r\nIt said:\r\n\r\nAiden Green\r\n\r\nDROWNED\r\n\r\nAnd a drawing of a body, its stomach bursting and crawling with bugs.\r\n\r\n Wordlessly I pressed my hand to the smooth stone, which glowed dark blue. The color of the water Aiden had drowned in.\r\n\r\nI have never told anybody that I had watched him die. It has always been my secret. A memory that I’ve buried and left to rot, but sometimes I dreamed about it, and sometimes I wished I had been the one that died.\r\n\r\nI watched as the headstone blurred and the drawing transformed. It was as though the stars were projecting onto his grave the last picture of Aiden Green ever to grace the earth.\r\n\r\nHis body lay on the muddy banks, and his eyes were open and filled with dirt and algae. Dark liquid seeped through his puffy lips, his stomach was bloated, and I knew it was full of bugs.\r\n\r\nAnd then it changed. The dead boy turned into a dead girl. Her hair was long and curly, and her skin was dark brown.\r\n\r\nHer stomach had burst open, and from her innards, flowers bloomed.\r\n\r\nMe. It was me.\r\n\r\nIt confirmed what I had already known. I was supposed to have drowned that day. Not Aiden.\r\n\r\nWe had been wading in the river and trying to catch small fish in our cupped hands.\r\n\r\nThis is where things get hazy. It’s as though someone has stabbed my memory and left it full of holes.\r\n\r\nOne moment Aiden and I were splashing each other and laughing, and the next, I was flailing in the river, trying to scream, but I swallowed mouthful after mouthful of water.\r\n\r\nAnd then I’m lying on the ground, shivering and terrified. I watched helplessly as the water overtook and swallowed Aiden.\r\n\r\nHe never resurfaced, no matter how much I screamed and begged. He was gone.\r\n\r\nI remember running through the woods, cold and scared, but I did not slow down. I ran until I reached my house, locked myself in my room, and cried in my bed for the rest of the day.\r\n\r\nThey found Aiden two days later and would have found him sooner if I had said something. Maybe they could have saved him if I had run fast enough and gotten help.\r\n\r\nIt was supposed to be me. I wanted to scream in his parents’ faces at his funeral, but I said nothing.\r\n\r\nIt’s remained my secret. It was mine and mine alone.\r\n\r\nThe Witch knew. Why else would she have this in her cemetery? It didn’t make sense because they told me he had been turned ash and bone.\r\n\r\n Perhaps that was true, but it didn’t matter here. Because here was The Witch’s realm. She decided what her reality comprised. \r\n\r\nI saw it so clearly. I imagined Aiden’s bloated face gazing up at me from underneath the ground. His torso would be splayed open like the fish in Marine Bio, and his eyes would be full of algae and grave dirt.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry, Aiden,” I said. “I am so sorry.”\r\n\r\nAt my words, as though inscribed by an invisible hand, letters appeared and formed into one word:\r\n\r\nsacrifice\r\n\r\nIt glowed blue like the ocean.\r\n\r\n“This is dumb.” A voice said behind me. I jumped. It was Madeline; she scowled at the headstone. “I mean, this is cool and all, but uh, how is it supposed to help?”\r\n\r\nBut I knew what to do, and I knew how to get in.\r\n\r\nWithout a word, I ran towards the brook, which in the night looked like it were full of black ink. It was much deeper than I thought, and that was good. That made it easy for me to sink into its depths and drown as I should have years ago.\r\n\r\nThis will show you guys the way, I thought. It will. I know it.\r\n\r\nAt least you guys will get out. Don’t you get it? I’m the sacrifice. I have to drown. It’s supposed to be me in that grave. Not Aiden.\r\n\r\nThe cool water burned my lungs, but eventually, the pain subsided, and I didn’t hurt anymore. I couldn’t feel anything. Everything was so calm and peaceful. My vision was fading. If this was what dying was, it wasn’t so bad.\r\n\r\n“It should have been you.”\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t bad at all.\r\n\r\n“You should have died instead.”\r\n\r\nI’m lying on mud, and soft lips are pressed against my own. I recognized the shape of those lips. I have kissed them countless times.\r\n\r\nThey breathed into me until I could breathe on my own. I vomited brackish water, and when I opened my eyes, Beck was above me. She was soaking wet and looked terrified.\r\n\r\n“What the fuck is wrong with you?” She gasped. “What the fuck, Lou?”\r\n\r\nI tried to answer, but more water bubbled up my throat.\r\n\r\n“It was supposed to be me,” I murmured. “I was supposed to die.”\r\n\r\n“Well, great, well done, you nearly did,” Beck snapped. She grabbed and held me and kissed me hard. “Don’t ever do that again.” She whispered into my ear. Her breath was so warm. “I can’t lose you, too. I can’t.”\r\n\r\nI hugged her back but said nothing. I was exhausted.\r\n\r\nWhen I felt I could stand, Beck, helped me up. I shivered, it was night now, and I was drenched. If The Witch didn’t kill me, my catching pneumonia definitely would. I felt horrible that Beck had gotten wet too. But I had to do it. It was the only way we could move forward.\r\n\r\nBack at Aiden’s grave, I saw that the headstone had been wiped clean--no epigraph, no drawing, just a smooth black slate.\r\n\r\nI am so sorry, Aiden, I thought, and the ground underneath me trembled ever so slightly. From the soil, I heard in a small voice that would always belong to a child:\r\n\r\n“I forgive you.”\r\n\r\nI touched the headstone again, and this time, it didn’t just glow. It rumbled and shifted forward, and I had to jump back to avoid falling into the chasm and the stairs that had been revealed. Steep stairs that, from what I could see, led deep into the ground. \r\n\r\nThe light from the moon revealed at the very bottom a solid stone path. \r\n\r\nAlways with the paths.\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence, and then Madeline giggled uneasily.\r\n\r\n“This is some Harry Potter shit,” she said, still laughing.\r\n\r\n“Some Legend of Zelda shit,” Ezra added.\r\n\r\nI laughed weakly.\r\n\r\n“Good job nearly killing yourself for this,” Beck said, but she didn’t sound mad. She sounded like she wanted to laugh as well.\r\n\r\n“No problem,” I croaked, and I cleared my throat. “Well, should we go in?” Beck nodded.\r\n\r\nEzra went down first, then Madeline, then me, and last came Beck. Her hand was warm on the small of my back.\r\n\r\nI was grateful that if I died here, I would not die alone. At least I would be surrounded by friends and the woman I loved.\r\n\r\nWe descended into a darkness I have never known before, and I watched the moon until it vanished and the dirt swallowed us.",

        "text": "***The Spirit in the woods***\n\nIt happened in the winter of 2015. I live in a small apartment complex in upstate South Carolina. It was bordered by woods around the left side of the apartment and the backside of the apartment. It was around one o’clock in the morning. I was on the stoop of the apartment complex smoking a cigarette thinking how bad I had screwed up my life so far. I was using illicit  substances at the time and was living with my Father. I was contemplating what I was doing with my life at the time and what I was going to do with it. When I heard rustling from the woods on the left side of the apartment. \n\nI thought I was hallucinating at the time from the drugs. Then I realized that I wasn't on drugs at the time that this series of events happened. So I turned to look at the rustling noise from the left side of the apartment. It was the scariest thing that I have ever seen in my life. It was crouched down on all fours; it was as white as snow. The limbs were bent at absurd angles for a thing that had looked like a human being; its face was the most nightmare-fueled features of anything on earth. It had the most empty dark void for eyes; it was like looking into a dark starless sky. It had no nose at all but all I saw was slits where the nose should be. The mouth was upturned into a smile with sharp pointed teeth protruding from its lips. I thought for a second that I was going to die. \n\nI'm not ashamed about what happened next. I got up from the chair as fast as a flash of lightning. I started to run from the stoop of the apartment up a flight of stairs to my apartment. Then I heard an inhuman scream coming from behind me while I was running up the staircase to my apartment. I surely thought that I wasn't going to make it in time before the creature had gotten me. But then I had gotten into the apartment before the creature had gotten me. My father and step-mother were at home at the time.\n\nI  had told them of what had happened to me outside just moments ago. They didn't believe me when I told them about it. They said I was hallucinating on the drugs at the time which I was a hundred percent sure I wasn't on at the time. They had told me to go to bed and get some sleep so that I would stop hallucinating. So I did as I was told and went to bed. My bed at the time was the couch in the living room at the time.  Because the apartment was a two bedroom. My parents had one room and my stepbrother had the other. I had only come home because I was homesick at the time because I was living as a vagabond across the United States. Thinking that if I changed my surroundings that my life would get better but that is a story for another time.\n\nSo I was laying on the couch trying to fall asleep. The couch is in front of the window that overlooks the woods in the backyard of the apartment as I was closing my eyes to try to fall asleep. There it was the creature that had emerged from the woods hanging on the window looking down on me from the window. Then I heard a strange voice inside my head telling me “ I am going to destroy your life by making it a living Hell until you want to die.” Then it had crawled away from the window and was going back into the woods. I couldn't fall asleep until the sun came out at dawn. So I had just laid there on the couch thinking was it a visual and auditory hallucination or was this creature real? So I had gotten some sleep during the day.\n\nWhen I awoke it was four PM in the afternoon. I was going to figure out what this creature was if it was a creature or a demon. So I had started to do research on what I had seen of the creature on google and had come up with one answer. I had found out the creature was the Rake. Now all I had to figure out was if there was a way to get rid of it out of my life from what I saw there was no way of getting rid of it. So I had thought that maybe drugs would solve the problem. Which of course did not solve it. The creature came back again that night walking around the woods behind the apartment complex. So at the time I thought that maybe I should let it kill me and end my miserable existence on this planet.\n\nI was too chicken though  to end my life by the creature's hand. I was even too wimpy to end my life by my own hands. Now I am grateful that I didn’t. I had become agoraphobic that I would not leave the house at all just sitting at the window. Hoping that the creature would just go away and leave me alone and let me just be miserable on my own standing. But nope it would not for the next month I would just stay inside the apartment and watch the creatures movements in the woods and out the corner of my eyes so afraid to leave the house. When I had finally gotten the courage to leave the house it was during the day so the creature wouldn't get me. I had to walk everywhere at the time because I didn't own a car at the time and you had to walk a long time before you got to any store where I am from.\n\nSo on one of these walks I had heard another voice. It sounded like a woman's voice that had told me where the creature lives and why it was coming after me. The voice had told me directions to this ravine near the main road where I live . It was a quarter of a mile away from the apartment complex. It had an opening for a big water drain for the rain water to runoff into the ravine. It looked so creepy that I was not willing to go anywhere near the place at all. The voice had told me that “ the creature was coming after me because I had so much negativity going on in my life that it feeds off of it. \n\nSo now it was the week of me finally getting tired of my lifestyle and wanting to change it. I went into the woods that night and was going to face the thing that was stalking me. I saw it deep in the woods and screamed at it to leave me alone and that I was bettering my life. It just walked away and disappeared. When I had exited the woods the road was lit up with yellow glowing lights and I knew if I tried to do better that my life would get better. Thanks for taking your time to read this story. It is my first time trying to write about my life.",

I pushed it away. ‘What is really going on here, May?’\n\n‘I don't know what you mean.’\n\nI groaned. ‘Stop that. You asked me to come here. You practically begged me. And here I am, hundreds of miles from home, risking my job. And you're playing dumb? What's the point?’\n\nThen she got that look. The one she always got when we were kids. When she knew the bad things were about to happen.\n\n‘I think we should leave.’ I said.\n\n‘Max is ill. I can’t just leave him. He’s my husband.’\n\nI wanted to punch her stupid husband.\n\n‘Jesus, May, he looks like he’s about to die. We can drive to town and send an ambulance back to get him. I’m not suggesting we just leave him here to die.’\n\n‘No,’ she said, with an authority in her voice I had never heard before.\n\n‘Fine. We don't have to go. Yet. But can we at least go for a walk? I need to get outside, and by the looks of it you've not seen the sun in weeks.’\n\nShe smiled. ‘Sun in Scotland? That's ambitious. Let me grab my coat.’\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n‘Not that way,’ she said.\n\nI was heading for the north woods, our favorite place to go walking together.\n\n‘You love that hike!’ I said.\n\n‘No,’ she said, refusing to look at me. ‘I don't want to. Let's just take the path to the road.’\n\n‘What’s the problem?’\n\nShe rounded on me, eyes wild, teeth clenched. Her whole face was like a bright red warning to shut the fuck up.\n\nShe actually reminded me a little of you, Christopher. I’d never seen her like that before.\n\n‘Just fucking drop it, Sam. I swear to god. I don't want to go traipsing about for hours in a fucking freezing forest with you. We are taking the path or I am going home. OK?’\n\nI just nodded, feeling nauseated and confused.\n\n‘Also, you have to leave tonight. Straight after dinner. I’m sorry, but Max and I are going away tomorrow. On holiday. We have things to work out.’\n\nThat was out of the blue. She had never mentioned a holiday before. I wanted to ask what she meant but the tension was thick. So instead, we walked in silence, crunching footsteps and shallow breaths the only sounds. I felt like a void had opened up. Like the ground had cracked between us and the two parts were moving away in opposite directions. She wasn’t acting like herself.\n\n'Sorry,' she said, eventually. 'I'm just scared. You know, like, I've always felt afraid. My whole life. All that stuff with dad and then with Brian, I've never really not worried. But it's actually different this time. It's somehow worse. Like, unbelievably worse.'\n\n'Please tell me what's going on, May.'\n\nShe stopped walking and took a deep breath. Her face went through some kind of process at that moment. I couldn’t put my finger on it at the time, but now I think she was organizing things in her head. Detangling events so that she could tell me only what she felt comfortable with. I did realize later that she wasn't telling me the full story, but I was okay with it. Some things are too difficult to share.\n\n'Max cheated on me with a schoolgirl.'\n\nI stopped dead. 'What. The. Fuck.'\n\n'I actually found out from the girl. I was walking through town and a bunch of them stopped me, all clearly younger than 18, by the way, and they said that Max doesn't like ‘dusty old cunts’. He prefers them fresh.' She shook her head. 'It's almost funny. Anyway, I didn't believe it at the time. Who would? Who wants to believe their husband is a sexual predator? But then one day he left home just 20 minutes before the local school got out. And I followed him.'\n\nShe looked me dead in the eye. 'I saw them, Sammy. Down an alley. They weren't doing anything but it's not like I stayed long enough to watch. I already knew the truth. There's no other explanation for him being there.'\n\nAn adulterer, a narcissist, and a fucking predator. I wanted to kill the bastard.\n\nI waited for more, but she was done. I was confused. The news was devastating. Humiliating. But May looked petrified. There had to be something more than just the cheating going on.\n\nBut she wasn’t going to say any more.\n\n'He's a bad person, May. I've always known it. Why won’t you just leave him?'\n\n'He is my husband. He made a mistake. I can't go through another divorce, Sammy, I am 36. I’m not young anymore, and I definitely don't have the looks. What's the point in living if I don’t have a husband?'\n\nClassic May. Marriage is the meaning of life. And I know exactly where that idea comes from. I can still hear those words, Christopher. They haunt me. What she heard repeated to her, day in, day out, in that fucking house; it destroyed her.\n\n*'Find a husband as soon as you possibly can, girls. A man to please. You won’t be fertile for long, and a barren bitch is a useless bitch.'*\n\nTruth is, the only constant in May’s whole life was abusive men, right from the moment she was old enough to understand what a man is. Her self-esteem wasn't just damaged; it was destroyed. Blown to bits and swept away—nothing left behind but that one conviction: you must be a good little wife, or you may as well die.\n\nI don't know why we turned out so different; why she internalized that message while I railed against it. But if Max's unfaithfulness, his sexual deviance, wouldn’t snap her out of it, then I would just have to drag her out.\n\n'We need to go to the police.' I said.\n\n'Please don’t say that, Sammy. He's better now. That's what I was going to tell you. Something has changed.'\n\n'Didn't look that way last night when his creepy ass was chasing me down the stairs.'\n\n'That's not what happened. Just wait. I’ll make him come to dinner. You haven’t even spent any time with him. You'll see. Besides, the police won't do anything. He's not committed a crime because the girl is over 16.'\n\n'I’m not sure about that, but fine. I’ll give him one chance. But if I’m not convinced, I’m dragging you out of this house myself. Kicking and screaming, if necessary.'\n\nShe nodded.\n\n'But,' I said. 'Something isn’t adding up here. I get that he cheated on you, but the other day you were on about his mental health. And why does he look like a zombie?'\n\n'Let's go back,' she said. 'It's getting cold.'\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n'Hi, Sammy.'\n\nThe dining room smelled of roasting meat and spices, and May clattered around in the kitchen with dishes and cutlery. Max sat in a chair at the head of the table, barely visible, except when touched by the flickering light of the fireplace. I didn’t bother replying to him.\n\n'Sit down,' he said. 'May’s making chicken.'\n\nI sat as far away as possible. Even in the half-light, I could see the sickly green hue of his skin. I didn’t think he was contagious. After all, he’d been staying with May and she was fine, but I still didn’t want to be near him.\n\n'What do you know of the Highlands, Samantha?'\n\n'It’s Sam.'\n\nHe smiled again. 'What do you know of the Highlands, *Sam*?'\n\n'Not a lot.'\n\n‘A shame, but not surprising. A city girl like you would never understand. This place sings to me. I feel it in my bones. On my skin. Augmenting my body, making me powerful.’\n\nI rolled my eyes. 'Whatever, Shakespeare. You’re not well.'\n\n'I’ve never felt better, actually.'\n\n'You have green skin and you’re talking nonsense.'\n\nHe snorted. 'You should go home, Sam.'\n\n'I will. And I’ll take May, too.'\n\nHe shook his head. 'I know what your game is. You think you’re here to save her.’ He leaned forward, his voice lowering. ‘But you already had your chance to save her, didn’t you? All those years ago. She was just a little girl, and he was hurting her.”\n\nI felt sick. How did he know? Had May told him? Was that what she thought too?\n\n‘You should have done something, Sam,’ he continued. ‘Should have told the police. A teacher. But instead, you left. You ran off and abandoned her. And the saddest part is, even when you were there, you should have been the target. Not her. But you couldn’t even do that right.’\n\n'You don’t know what the fuck you’re talking about.'\n\n'You know it’s true. If you hadn’t been such an ugly—'\n\n'Shut up.'\n\n'—graceless—'\n\n'I will genuinely punch you.'\n\n'—manly—'\n\n“Stop!”\n\n'—wretch—'\n\nI stood up.\n\n'—then perhaps he would have taken you instead.'\n\nI realized I was crying. On a rational level, I knew that what he said was unfair. I was a child. I never abused May. How could it be my fault? But there was still something buried in me, a guilt, a shame, that Max had wrenched up.\n\nMay flew into the room, hands red and soapy, eyes wide. 'What’s all the shouting about?'\n\nI looked at her, and then back to Max. He watched me, a smirk on his face. I couldn’t look at him for another second. 'Nothing,' I said. 'I’m going for a smoke.'\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe yard was covered in snow. My cigarettes were in the car, parked by the southern treeline of the woods. I wasn’t allowed to bring them into the house.\n\nThere was a light in the trees. You know when you see something that is typically so innocuous, but it is presenting itself in a whole new way? You feel like you should recognize what you're looking at—like the answer is there but your brain hasn't quite caught up. That's what it felt like seeing those lights.\n\nThey were floating, but I couldn’t see anything holding them up. They looked like candle flames, but bigger, and instead of orange, they were golden. Three of them.\n\nAnd I loved them.\n\nI felt warm looking at them, and I knew I’d stumbled upon something special. Something completely new. Something the world had never seen before, but now they would because of me. I found them. They were mine.\n\nI’m trying to accurately recount my emotions at the time. I still remember the experience clearly; one of the few things in this story I don’t need to think too hard about. And I know now, looking back, that my reaction was unusual. Floating lights in the forest at night? I should have walked away. Or recorded it. Or shouted May. Something other than what I did.\n\nBut instead, I walked towards them. They danced in the air like fireworks, leaving trails of light behind. And I could hear them too; a faint musical murmur. Beautiful. And cute! Like the sound of a baby animal.\n\n'What are you?' I said. And they laughed. And it was pure joy. And I followed them, deeper into the woods, not caring that it was so dark, so late, so cold. These were my new friends, my loves, and I had to know where they were taking me. Would there be more there? I was praying for it.\n\nWe arrived at a small loch. The lights danced out over it, their golden dazzle reflecting on the surface of the water. I wanted to touch them. I was ready to swim for the opportunity. I took a step forward.\n\nMy foot squelched in something cold and slimy.\n\nAll at once, the lights dove into the water. Their brilliance disappeared as if a switch had been flicked, and then I couldn’t see a thing.\n\nReality came rushing back. What was I doing? I was alone, far from home, surrounded by trees and snow and water and the deep black of a remote Highlands night.\n\nAnd whatever was beneath my feet.\n\nI took a step back. As my shoe came away, so did some of the substance, and a foul stench, like spoiled meat and shit, came away with it. I almost gagged, but a whisper of crunching snow nearby put a terror in me so intense it shocked me into stillness.\n\nI froze, the darkness gathering around me like a cloak. There was no sound but my own suppressed breathing. Then, as if they had been waiting for me to stop and pay attention, the lights burst back up out of the loch and the area was again awash in their glow.\n\nBut it wasn’t the same as before. In place of the warm golden color, there was now a sickly green. I immediately thought of Max, of his skin, and although I didn’t understand anything at that moment, faint connections were forming in my brain and panic was seizing at my chest. Instinctively I stepped back. My feet collided again with something soft and slimy, but this time I slipped, fell and landed at eye level with a sight that shredded the last few slivers of my composure.\n\nThree black dogs. Bellies cut. Guts spilled. Eyes shriveled and sightless.\n\nIt took a few moments before I realized I was screaming. And then I noticed another sound, a new chorus, joining. The lights. I somehow knew it was them, like I had known before with their faint murmuring, but the sound now was something different. I don’t know if they were words or just guttural, awful sounds, but I can still hear them to this day.\n\n*coo shee rook ich uh ree ishd*\n\nOver and over, these strange sounds emanated from the green orbs spinning above the lake. Alongside the stink of the dogs and the threat of whatever thing whispered and rustled in the dark, I felt fear like I never had before.\n\nAnd then I saw HER.\n\nShe stood naked, a tornado of snow swirling around her, patches of ice stuck to her skin. And her eyes, even bathed as they were in the green light of the flames, blazed blue from behind her matted fringe.\n\nThe lights changed their song.\n\n*ka lee ach ka lee ach ka lee ach*\n\nIt echoed through the whole forest. It must have been audible for miles. And it felt so dark, so WRONG. I couldn't stand it. At that moment I knew, more than I had ever known anything, that if I didn’t move, I would die.\n\nI sprinted through the trees, but that demented fucking song never got any quieter. I could hear footsteps at my heels, unhurried, but constantly there, no matter how far I ran. I had the sense I was being toyed with. The chanting got louder.\n\n*coo shee rook ich uh ree ishd coo shee rook ich uh ree ishd coo shee rook ich uh ree ishd coo shee rook ich uh ree ishd coo shee rook ich uh ree ishd coo shee rook ich uh ree ishd coo shee rook ich uh ree ishd coo shee rook ich uh ree ishd coo shee rook ich uh ree ishd ka lee ach ka lee ach ka lee ach ka lee ach ka lee ach ka lee ach KA LEE ACH KA LEE ACH KA LEE ACH*\n\nAs they reached the highest note, my head screaming with the agony of it, a howl ripped through the air. Reflexively, I looked behind me. My foot caught on something hard and I slammed into the ground.\n\nI remember there was no pain, just cold. Nothing was broken, I know that now, but I still couldn’t move. I can’t be sure but I think she was behind that. Some kind of fucking spell or something. Which leads me to believe she could have paralyzed me at any moment, and letting me run at all was just her idea of a cruel joke.\n\nThe footsteps stopped behind my head.\n\n'You shouldn’t have come here. I warned you.' Her voice burned like ice. And it echoed, though whether through the whole forest or just in my head, I don’t know.\n\nI couldn’t speak. Couldn’t move. So I just held my breath, prayed to a God I didn’t believe in and waited to die.\n\n'But,' she said. 'Your love for the woman runs deep. The man is mine; he was given willingly.'\n\nGiven?\n\n'You can still save your sister if she is smart enough to accept. I will give you that chance. But be quick. You don't have long. And when I come to claim my *coo shee*, I will take everything left in that house.'\n\nAnd that’s the last thing I remember from the forest.\n\nMay shook me awake. I was lying on the ground in front of her house, frozen.\n\n'Where have you been?' she asked. 'Max is out looking for you.'\n\n'I don’t know. Something is going on here.'\n\nMay frowned. But not in a confused way, or even a curious way. Just a worried one. 'We have to get inside. Come on.'\n\n'No,' I said. 'We have to leave. Now.'\n\n'Just come on. We can talk more once we’re warm. It’s freezing out here.'\n\nShe hooked an arm around mine and pulled me into the house. When I was warmed up, coffee in hand, May sat next to me on the couch and began to cry.\n\n'I’m so sorry, Sammy.'\n\nReflexively, I leaned into her but stopped short after seeing the look on her face. I knew immediately what this moment was. She was opening up, unfolding for the first time since I arrived. And that’s when I realized that she hadn’t shown any surprise at all, not at anything I said. I told her this fantastical story about lights and dead dogs and an old woman caked in ice, and the whole time she had barely blinked.\n\n'I don't know how to tell you this,' she said through sobs. 'Honestly, I wasn't going to tell you. But I saw them, too; the lights. I saw you follow them into the woods. I ran out, and I called after you, but you didn't hear me. It was like you were in a trance.'\n\nI already had so many questions, but I sensed now was the time for listening. So I just nodded.\n\nShe went on, collecting herself a little. 'I honestly don't know what those lights were. I promise you that. And if I had ever thought you were in any danger, I wouldn't have asked you to come here. To the house. But whatever they were, I do know where they took you. I'm almost certain of it. I mean… who they took you to.'\n\nMy stomach clenched. 'You’ve seen her too.'\n\nMay nodded through fresh tears.\n\n'I've never been so scared in my life, May. I could have died out there. I was alone, freezing, in the middle of the night, with some fucking… whatever the fuck it is, following me. And you’re telling me now that you’ve seen it before? And not only that, but you sent Max to find me? Max, who is the reason I am here, who is clearly clinically fucking insane, and who chased me around your house the other night? You sent him?'\n\nShe was fully crying now, her chest heaving. She wailed words at me but I could barely make them out. Seeing the pain she was in, the complete despair, softened me a little. I took her hand. 'Jesus. Alright. It’s okay, May. I’m sorry. I just want to know what’s going on.'\n\nIt took some time, but she calmed down. 'This whole thing is my fault.'\n\n'No, it's not.'\n\nShe raised her eyes to me. 'It is. I made Max sick. I haven’t told you everything.'\n\nI waited.\n\n'After I found out Max was cheating, I went for a walk in the woods. Our walk. But I went further than I ever have, and I came to this Loch. The same place she took you. Please understand. I was distraught. Terrified. All my life, I've been with these men who hurt me, who end up hating me. I don't know what I am doing wrong, and I can't seem to fix it, no matter how good a wife I try to be.'\n\nI couldn’t see how any of that was relevant. I opened my mouth, but she stopped me.\n\n'I was going to throw myself into the water. I didn't know what would happen. If I would just float there, drown, get swept away somewhere. I didn't really care either. That's when I texted you; that weird text you freaked out about. I was in a bad place. But before I could do anything, she appeared. That woman.'\n\nI thought back to a few weeks before. May had sent me a message. Something like: 'I love you and I’m sorry for everything'. I called her 16 times over the course of two hours before she picked up. I was already in my car on the way to Scotland. I had turned back home in a blind rage when she said everything was fine and I should just forget it.\n\nMay took a sip of her coffee, grimaced, and then went into the kitchen. She came back with two bottles of wine. No glasses.\n\n'She actually sounded like you at first. Said it wasn't my fault. That it was the men who were at fault. Blah blah blah.' She took a big gulp. 'But then she told me she could fix Max. All I had to do was agree to it.'\n\n'How could she fix him?'\n\n'I thought the same. I told her to leave me alone to die. She said fine and stood back. Then I did it. I threw myself into the water.'\n\nBut nothing happened. When May was due to hit the icy surface, she instead found herself standing up, back in the same position as before. She tried again, but the same happened. And the whole time, the woman laughed at her.\n\n'I asked her what was going on. She shrugged and said ‘the Lochs take only their own’. I don't know. She said I might ‘procure some rope and try a tree’ but by that point I was furious. I wanted to punch the smirk right off her face. But then she asked me again if I would accept her help. I don't know why I agreed this time. Maybe it was the fact something impossible had just happened to me, or maybe my mania had just taken over. But either way, I agreed. And she said fine, and to wait there, while she prepared the ritual.'\n\nThe woman came back moments later followed by three black dogs. They were like nothing May had ever seen; huge, snarling beasts with thick teeth jutting out from behind black, leathery lips. And their faces were grotesque, too. Eyes like dark tunnels.\n\n'Before I continue, please know I already hate myself for this more than anybody else ever could. It might have been the woman influencing me, or because the dogs were so disturbing to look at… or maybe I'm just a shitty person. Either way, she handed me a knife and told me to cut the dogs’ throats. She said I had already seen her magic at work, and that she absolutely could 'fix' Max, but only if I did exactly what she said.'\n\nMay took another gulp of wine. And then another. 'I don't have an excuse for any of this. Not a good enough one, anyway. But I was desperate, alone, and afraid, and this woman had already demonstrated some power I couldn't understand. I thought she could really save me and Max. I truly did. And the dogs were horrible things. It made me cringe to look at them. I just couldn’t stop myself.'\n\nI felt sick. 'You killed three animals. Three living things. That’s not you.'\n\nShe slammed the bottle on the table. 'Is it not? What the fuck do you know about me anyway? We live in different countries, Sam. And I am so fucking tired of being this pathetic little woman. Nobody has ever loved me, no matter how hard I try. Instead, they beat me and humiliate me. I am so fundamentally fucking broken. She offered me a way out, a way to keep my husband. To fix him. To make him LOVE me. So yes, I did it. I won’t die alone, Sam. I refuse.'\n\nEverything she said, I had heard before. The lessons she learned in that house. It’s all her fault; never the men who hit her, degrade her or cheat on her. I felt the same old reassurances coming to my lips, but I held back. They never worked. 'Okay…' I put up my hands. 'Okay. Just tell me what happened next.'\n\nShe sighed. 'She made me drag the bodies into the loch. Then I was to wait until the blood had turned the water red. It was so strange. It was freezing outside, but the water actually started to get hot. I thought I was going to be boiled alive… She told me to say Max’s name over and over. I can remember now what she said, and I hate myself for not picking up on it at the time. It was maybe too late anyway.'\n\n'What did she say?'\n\n'‘Call his name and give him to me’.' She shrugged. 'And that’s what I did.'\n\nSam slumped in her chair. She lifted the bottle to her lips again but realized it was empty. She opened the second one.\n\nI wanted to comfort her, but I knew there was nothing I could say. I had seen that woman myself, whatever she was. If May truly had given her permission to do something to Max, then what could we do about it? We didn’t even know what we were dealing with, let alone how to stop it.\n\n'Is that when he started to change?' I said.\n\n'Yes. A few days after it happened, he disappeared. That was the first night he went out. When he came back, he seemed happy, although there was something different about him. Like, not quite right. He said ‘the woman in the woods is going to make me strong’.' May spat out a laugh, which startled me. 'She was right, by the way. I did get him back. He’s not looked at that stupid little girl since. Now he only has plans for me.'\n\n'What do you mean? What plans?'\n\nShe stared at the wine bottle. 'You have to go now. I shouldn’t have asked you to come at all. I was just so scared.'\n\nShe was closing up again. I started to panic. 'No, May, listen. Whatever happened here, it doesn’t matter. You can still get out.'\n\nShe was shaking her head.\n\n'Look,' I said, 'that woman. She said Max can’t be saved, but you can. We can just walk out of here. It’s that easy. Just come with me.'\n\nShe gazed over at the window. I barely heard her next words. 'I don’t think I want to leave.'\n\n'What?'\n\nShe looked at me. Her eyes were spilling over, but there was also something like relief on her face. 'I can’t do it anymore, Sammy. I couldn’t bear to be alone again. For all Max’s faults, I know that he loves me. He promised that we’ll be together forever.'\n\n'That is fucking madness. Get your shit and come with me. I’m serious, now.'\n\nShe shook her head. 'You won’t ever get it.'\n\n'What the fuck? How do I not get it?'\n\nYou will want to stop reading. Don’t. You’re almost at the end.\n\n'Because,' she said, after downing the last of the wine. 'It wasn’t you, was it? He didn’t touch you every night. He didn’t creep into your bedroom at 2 am, shake you awake, and call you a slut, a whore, or tell you you deserved everything you got. You didn’t spend all those fucking nights praying that the house would burn down with him and you in it. You didn’t feel any of that, Sam. You just left.'\n\n'May—'\n\n'I know it’s not fair. I know he hurt you sometimes too. And I know that you feel guilty anyway, and you’ve spent all these years trying to make it up to me. Running down here every single time to clean up my messes. Risking your job. And I took full advantage of that, didn’t I? I used you and your guilt and some days I can’t even look at myself in the fucking mirror without screaming. And I know how wrong he was, Sammy. I do. I know that it’s okay to be alone and that it’s okay to be a woman without a man. But even though I know all that, I still feel utterly worthless without one. And I know Max is my last chance. So please just let me go with him. Live your life. Without me around to hold you back, you can make something of yourself. Be somebody. I really believe that.'\n\nI was crying now too. 'Please stop. You know I can’t leave without you.'\n\n'I won’t go.'\n\n'Then we both die.'\n\nShe slapped me, her face twisted with rage and pain into something gruesome. I was scared. Not of her, not of what she might do to me or what she had already done; but of the looming possibility that I really had lost her forever. But then it all melted away, and she started to cry again.\n\n'I am doing this for you, too,' she said. 'I want you to be free of me.'\n\n'But I don’t want to be free of you. I want to help you.'\n\nShe got up from the couch.\n\n'Where are you going?' I asked.\n\nShe smiled at me. 'To pack.'\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nMay and I got to the car 30 minutes later. The whole time I was looking over my shoulder, close to madness at the thought of Max returning. But we made it. And May looked better already. She walked with shoulders back, head up, like all those lies she’d been telling herself had been twisting her spine and now she was free of them.\n\nFor the first time since her call the other day, I also felt relaxed. And optimistic about the future. We would be okay, and this time I wasn’t going to let her run off with anyone else until I had thoroughly vetted them. I hated the thought of babying her but clearly, that’s what she needed. She almost fucking killed herself.\n\nI got into the car and started the engine. The windows were frosted up, and I didn’t want to wait the time it would take for them to clear up from the heat, so I reached into the glovebox to grab the scraper.\n\nMay wasn’t getting into the car.\n\nI realized immediately how stupid I’d been. All that stuff about her seeming more upright, more at peace with herself. It wasn’t because she’d let go of her demons. It was because she’d accepted them.\n\nI scrambled out of the car and turned towards the house.\n\nThere were two figures by the open front door; black silhouettes against the hallway light. One male, hunched, diminished. The other was my sister. My beautiful, broken sister.\n\nHer head turned to me one last time, and I sprinted towards her. But I was too far away. She took Max’s hand, and together they walked back through the door and locked it behind them.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI don’t know how long I spent screaming at the house. I tried to call 999, but of course, there was no service. Then I spent an eternity with my head pressed into the cold rubber of the steering wheel, sobbing uncontrollably.\n\nFinally, with nothing else to do, I drove away.\n\nI returned two hours later with a police car. I told them May was in imminent danger. By that point, the front door was unlocked, but the house was empty. Nothing was disturbed or stolen: no sign of struggle at all. To the police, it looked like they had both simply up and left of their own accord. No crime committed. They weren’t happy with me at all.\n\nAfter a few days, though, and with Max’s own family reporting that he hadn’t contacted them, the police opened a missing persons case. It never went anywhere. I gave them as much information as I could, but I had to withhold huge parts of the real story. They would have just thought me crazy.\n\nIn the end, though, I realized it didn’t matter. Case or no case. Wherever she was, she was beyond the reach of humanity. And now I have to live in a world where I not only know that there are demons like that woman out there but also where I know that my sister, my May, is in the clutches of one. And who knows what is happening to her right now? Who knows what pain she is feeling? What torture?\n\nWhen I began writing this letter, I was just trying to get some closure. But as I approached the end, I had something like an epiphany.\n\nLast week I packed up my car. Booked a hotel up north in Scotland. And I went on a hike.\n\nIt took me a while, but I found that loch again. And the woman too. She called me a fool for returning and explained that I had my chance to save May and I failed. I knew all of that though. That’s not why I was there.\n\nI didn’t know how it worked. It was all a shot in the dark, to be honest. But what else did I have to lose?\n\nI performed the ritual. I killed the dogs. I stepped into the bloody water.\n\nAnd I gave her your name.\n\nI know you probably don’t believe any of this, but I don’t care. You’ll find out soon enough. At the beginning of this letter, I told you you were in danger. And now, at the end, I have the pleasure of telling you it is all because of me. And there is no way out.\n\nNothing will make up for what you did to her, Christopher. To your own daughter.\n\nBut it’s a start, at least.\n\nSam.",

        "text": " \n\n## The Kidnapping\n\nOnce upon a time, there were three teenagers - Amanda, Sarah, and Rachel - who were abducted and held captive in a dark, damp cellar by \"Pumpkin Man\". Little did they know, Pumpkin Man was a host to 70 different personalities, each possessing unique abilities and traits.\n\nThe girls were trapped in the cellar for days, not knowing what was happening or who their captor was. They could hear strange noises and whispers coming from the other side of the door, but they couldn't make out what was being said.\n\nOne day, they heard a loud, guttural roar coming from the other side of the door. The door suddenly burst open, and the girls were faced with a sight they would never forget. Pumpkin Man had transformed into the 71st personality, known as the Monster.\n\nThe Monster was unlike anything the girls had ever seen before. It had superhuman strength, enhanced speed, and was able to leap great distances and heights. It also had superhuman durability, as bullets from a shotgun seemed to barely affect it. The Monster also had wall-crawling abilities, and could easily climb onto walls and other surfaces with ease.\n\nThe girls were terrified, as the Monster seemed to possess pain suppression abilities, ignoring any wounds from the bullets. It also made animalistic vocalizations, adding to the already frightening atmosphere.\n\nThe girls tried their best to escape, but the Monster was always one step ahead of them. They soon realized that they were no match for the Monster's abilities and powers.\n\nOne night, as they huddled together in fear, they heard a faint whisper. It was the voice of one of Pumpkin Man's other personalities, warning them of the dangers of the Monster and telling them to escape while they still could.\n\n## The Escape\n\nThe Monster moved closer to Sarah, ready to finish her off. But then, he noticed the scars on her abdomen and chest. Sarah had been abused by her uncle and legal guardian, Nate, both before and after her father's death. The Monster was taken aback by Sarah's \"purity,\" despite the horrors she had faced in her life. Sarah was terrified, but the Monster showed mercy and spared her life.\n\nSarah's escape from the cellar marked the beginning of a long and painful journey towards recovery. Despite being rescued, she was still haunted by the memories of the horrors she had experienced at the hands of the Pumpkin Man and the Monster. The physical scars on her body were just a reminder of the emotional scars she carried within.\n\nAs she started to regain her strength, Sarah decided to confront her uncle, Nate, and bring him to justice for what he had done to her. She gathered the courage to testify against him in court, reliving her traumatic experiences all over again.\n\nThe trial was grueling, and Sarah was subjected to intense scrutiny and questioning, but she remained steadfast and resolute in her quest for justice. In the end, her testimony was enough to convict Nate, who was sentenced to life in prison.\n\nWith the closure that came with seeing her abuser brought to justice, Sarah was finally able to start the healing process. She sought therapy and support from her friends and family, and slowly but surely, she was able to come to terms with her experiences and move forward.\n\nAlthough the memories of her time in the cellar would never fully fade, Sarah was grateful for the resilience and strength she had found within herself. She realized that she was not a victim, but a survivor, and that she had the power to overcome the horrors she had faced.\n\nAnd so, Sarah lived the rest of her life with a newfound sense of hope and determination, never forgetting the lessons she had learned and the strength she had discovered in the face of fear and adversity.\n\n## Ending\n\nAs the personalities of Pumpkin Man convene in another hideout, they discuss the immense power that \"The Monster\" holds. They marvel at its strength, agility, and durability, and they know that they have the ability to create chaos and destruction with it. The personalities decide that they will use the Monster's powers to their advantage, and they plan to change the world in their image.\n\nBut as they discuss their plans, the personalities of Pumpkin Man start to argue and fight amongst themselves. They have different visions for the future and different ideas about how to achieve their goals. Some want to use the Monster as a weapon of war, while others want to use it for more subtle forms of control.\n\nDespite their differences, the personalities of Pumpkin Man all share one thing in common: their ambition and their desire for power. They believe that with the Monster by their side, they can achieve anything they set their minds to. But as they proceed with their plans, they soon realize that the Monster is not as easily controlled as they thought.\n\nAs they try to rein in the Monster and make it do their bidding, they begin to realize the true extent of its power. The Monster is more than just a weapon or a tool, it is a force of nature, with its own will and desires. It will not be controlled, and it will not be used for the benefit of others.\n\nDespite their best efforts, the personalities of Pumpkin Man find that they are no match for the power of the Monster. They are quickly overpowered and swept aside, as the Monster takes control and sets its sights on the world beyond the cellar. The fate of the world hangs in the balance as the Monster sets out to assert its dominance and claim its place as the ruler of all.\n\nAs the scene shifts to Pumpkin Man standing outside an AMC movie theater, staring at the poster for the film \"Split.\" He gazes at it for a moment, contemplating all that has transpired. The power of the Monster, the fear and terror it elicits, is a reminder of the depths to which humanity can sink.\n\nPumpkin Man turns and walks away, his thoughts heavy with the knowledge of what the future may hold. As he walks into the night, he wonders what his next move should be. Will he continue to seek power and control, or will he try to do something to stop the evil that he has unleashed?\n\nIn the end, only time will tell what will become of Pumpkin Man and the 70 personalities that reside within him. But one thing is for sure, the world will never be the same after their actions.\n\n## Days Later\n\nOne night, as Sarah was walking home from work, she suddenly heard the same guttural roar that she had heard in the cellar. She turned around, and there stood the Monster, looming over her. She tried to run, but the Monster was too fast and caught her easily.\n\nSarah's mother was frantic with worry, as her daughter had been missing for several days. She had searched the entire house, but there was no sign of Sarah. She talked to her friends and family, but no one had seen or heard from her.\n\nDesperate for answers, Sarah's mother decided to visit the old abandoned cellar where the three girls had been held captive. She hoped that she might find some clues or even Sarah herself.\n\nAs she approached the entrance of the cellar, she heard a strange noise coming from inside. She cautiously stepped forward and peered into the darkness. That's when she saw it. The Monster was inside the cellar, and Sarah was lying at its feet.\n\nSarah's mother screamed in terror, but the Monster paid her no attention. It was preoccupied with Sarah, who was lying there unconscious. The Monster seemed to be muttering something under its breath, but Sarah's mother couldn't make out what it was saying.\n\nWithout hesitation, Sarah's mother ran back to her car and called the police. The police arrived on the scene and tried to get inside the cellar, but the Monster was too powerful and managed to escape.\n\nDays passed, and Sarah was never seen or heard from again. The police searched for the Monster and Pumpkin Man, but they were never found.\n\nTo this day, the story of Sarah and the Monster remains a mystery, and no one knows what really happened that night. But one thing is certain, anyone who hears the story will be left with a feeling of unease and will never be able to shake the image of the Monster from their mind.",

        "text": "They sat at a table not far from mine. The diner was practically empty, not exactly a prime location for romantic dates with its grease-slick floors and ever-present aroma of burnt bacon. And yet they’d seated themselves at the table immediately to my left, as if they needed an audience for their public displays of affection.  \n\nI had already ordered, so I kept my face down and ate my breakfast bowl in peace. But every so often I’d hear them loudly professing their love for another, and giggling, and making all manner of needlessly performative gestures. It bordered on perverse, so I eventually looked pointedly at them with what I hoped was a silencing glare. I was just trying to eat my lunch in peace.   \n\nThe woman noticed my look, and in misinterpretation—or defiance—of the intended effect, smiled at me. The man, seeing her attention elsewhere, turned; and he too smiled. Their flippant responses would’ve angered me, had I not noticed the oddness of their expressions. The smiles weren’t impolite, not exactly. But there was something *beneath* them, an underlying impression or intimation of...hostility? One that was far more potent than what I'd added to my glare.  \n\nJust then my waitress came over with a pot of coffee. I extended my mug, happy to have the awkward interaction with the couple interrupted. When the waitress left, I saw that the couple had resumed their obnoxious snogging. Too tired to reengage, just wanting to finish my meal and go home, I quickly ate my eggs and drained my mug. \n\nAs I was walking past the couple to pay at the counter, I overheard the woman mention something about “loners”, and I was immediately sure that she was talking about me. I stopped in my tracks and glared at her, though this time she ignored me; even though I was standing only a few feet away. The man then laughed, either in response to the woman’s comment, or at my admittedly weird posturing. I wasn’t actually going to *do* anything, merely wanted them to know that I’d overheard.  \n\nThe waitress, perhaps seeing the interaction and wanting to avoid trouble, called over to me, asking if I was ready to pay. I nodded and turned away from the gossiping lovers. I paid, tipping a little more than usual for having nearly caused a scene, even though I felt that the couple were the ones ultimately responsible.  \n\nBefore I could step out the door, I heard someone call out, “Hey, you!”. Turning, I saw that it had been the woman, who was rising from her table. She came over to me and asked, “We saw that you were alone. You don’t have to be—not today. You’re free to come with us, if you’d like. We’re just going around town, enjoying the day.”  \n\nI was surprised, not just by the offer, but by the woman’s beauty, which I had apparently failed to notice in my agitation. It was almost discomforting, like staring into an exceptionally bright light. Her features were starkly refined yet relaxed, her eyes piercing, as if she had never once felt anything but total confidence in any given social situation. \n\n It was obvious that I couldn’t refuse, so I meekly nodded; and as if sensing my response—he'd been facing the other way—the man rose from his seat and joined us. He paid for their meal and the three of us left together.  \n\nLuckily, I hadn’t made any other plans for the day, otherwise I would’ve abandoned them without hesitation, regardless of with whom they’d been.  \n\nThe three of us spent a few hours walking around town, exploring different shops and buying a few items here and there. I learned that they were visitors, had come from somewhere in “Old Europe”; a phrase whose meaning I couldn’t exactly discern, but accepted, nonetheless. Aside from that, they said very little about themselves, and instead questioned me on my life, specifically why I was alone on Valentine’s Day.  \n\nNaturally, I felt embarrassed by the question, and offered the simple though undoubtedly unconvicting response that I’d never felt the need to find a date just to celebrate the “Holiday”. I was given the appropriate “That’s fair!” response, and the subject was promptly dropped; but the woman would occasionally point out random women and ask how I felt about them, if I found them beautiful; and the man would laugh. There was nothing mocking about it, I sensed none of the smoldering animosity I’d seen in their gazes back at the diner. Things were still awkward, but no more so than you’d expect, in such strange circumstances.  \n\nThings took a turn for the worse when we entered a bookstore. There were, understandably, plenty of couples browsing the shelves and occupying the tables at the attached café. My companions quickly fell into form, grabbing cups of coffee and wandering through the aisles. Since I’d had a couple cups back at the diner, I chose to forgo more caffeine, and instead followed casually behind them whilst trying not to appear as some pathetic third wheel.  \n\nIt took a few moments for me to notice, but eventually I realized that we were slowly meandering through the sections concerned with history, mythology, and ancient cultures; specifically, those of a European nature. I remembered then what they had said of their origins and tried to pay close attention to where their attention lingered, so that I could figure out their exact heritage. But before I could deduce anything definite, the man turned to me and said, “You know, while this is all interesting and informative from a general perspective, there really isn’t anything here that’ll tell you the *full* truth of it—of us. You know?”  \n\nI had no idea what he was talking about, so I replied, “What do you mean?” He smiled, and while the expression was outwardly friendly, I again perceived a subtler, darker meaning behind what now seemed like a superficial mask of friendliness. \n\nAt that moment my heart rate quickened a little, and as if overhearing it the man looked down at my chest. And for the briefest second, the face *beneath* appeared, a once-dormant malice flaring to the surface. I wouldn’t go so far as to say it was demonic, but there was a certain inhumanity about it, and I instinctively backed away.  \n\nThe bookshelf behind me stopped my progress, and panic seized my limbs. But the man’s face relaxed, and his smile became no more threatening than that of a mischievous friend. \n\n“Are you alright?” There was no ironic or ulterior inflection to the question, but I nonetheless felt compelled to answer in the affirmative.  \n\n“I’m fine, yeah.” I couldn’t stop my heart from going haywire, but the man diverted his eyes from my chest to meet my gaze. He nodded and beckoned for me to follow him.  \n\nWe caught up to his partner, who had wandered over to the horror section. There, she’d apparently found something of interest to her; she was engrossed in a book of old supernatural tales. The man went and stood behind her, placing his hands on her hips and peering over her shoulder.  \n\nEvery few moments they would chuckle together. Curious, I ventured a little closer and peered at the opened pages. I vaguely recognized the story as a tale about old blood-drinkers; not exactly vampires, but something similar: more feral, having none of the pomp and aristocratic heritage commonly associated with the mythic horrors.  \n\nAfter a while, they closed the book and wandered off, and I followed; somehow knowing that they expected me to. They went toward an area of the bookstore that was under renovation. The section—which had apparently held magazines and book-related trinkets—was cordoned off by tape, the accompanying walls bare and re-painted. The area was around a corner, away from the main flow of the foot traffic. As the couple rounded this corner, I felt an alarm go off in my head; a dim animal warning not to follow them. But another impulse—one that felt like it had been implanted—suppressed that seemingly primal trepidation, and I went around.  \n\nI still can’t figure out how they managed to transform so quickly.  \n\nIn the five or six seconds it took me to join them, they’d turned into something *else;* something both less and more than human—older than mankind yet somehow more evolved, more refined in savagery.  \n\nThey were alike in general appearance, though the woman had retained her female characteristics, and the man his. Their bodies had broadened, becoming nearly as wide as the bookshelves we’d left behind. Their eyes had parted further, resting now at their temples, giving them a weird, fish-like appearance above their now pointed noses. Their skulls had expanded, ballooning to a size and shape that was nauseating in its unwholesomeness. The once blonde hair on both their heads had inexplicably greyed, now hanging in withered clumps from their irregularly lumpy scalps.  \n\nWith bestially arched backs and hunched shoulders, they stood like proto-men, but their narrow-eyed expressions bespoke of a callous intellect. Their clothes—taut in some places, loose in others—bore fresh bloodstains; as if the transformation had caused their skin to burst or tear.  \n\nThey were awful, abominable things, and yet I couldn’t even so much as turn away. I was awestruck, terror-stricken; I knew then that from the moment they’d laid eyes on me, I’d been under their monstrous thralldom.  \n\n“No one should be alone on this day.” They spoke in unison, with voices that might’ve belonged to a reclusive crypt-keeper, if not the dead he kept. The woman’s mouth—which, somehow, had become utterly lipless—opened, and from out of it came a long, red-veined flesh tube, like an insect’s proboscis. I watched, horrified, as it snaked its way through the air toward me.  \n\nUnable to even move, I could do nothing but whimper sheepishly as the appendage touched my neck. Remembering the book they’d laughed at, I mustered the courage to beg them not to drink my blood—assuming that they were some horrid precursors of Vampires. They laughed—the woman accomplishing this despite the long tube extending from her mouth—and the sound sent a stifling chill down my spine, silencing me.  \n\nThe man, with his ungodly face, smiled and said, “Dear, could you imagine if we *drank* blood? If we needed to subsist on that vile stuff?”  \n\nThe woman, with her tubular tongue still dancing around my neck, replied, “Oh, I’d just give it all up. What a dreadful life, that’d be.”  \n\nThey let loose another round of that hoarse, ghoulish laughter, and my soul shrank.  \n\n“No, I’m not going to drink your blood, *child.* I’m going to give you some of **mine.”**  \n\nJust then, there was a stabbing pain in my neck, and the tube went rigid right to the woman’s mouth. There was a pulsing sensation, and I felt something being steadily pumped into me. I swooned as if suddenly and deeply intoxicated. Something foreign was coursing through my veins, paradoxically chilling and warming me. I at once felt feverous, drunk, physiologically unstable.  \n\nEventually, the proboscis was withdrawn. The woman slurped it back into her mouth like some vein-streaked noodle. My legs gave way and I hit the floor just as their de-transformation began.  \n\nI was gently shaken awake by an employee of the bookstore. Their face was full of concern, and I saw that they’d dialed 911 on their phone, though hadn’t yet called. Still a bit dazed, I looked around for the nightmare couple, but saw only a small crowd of concerned customers. Wanting to believe that it had all been some kind of fever daydream, I assured everyone that I was fine, and let the bookstore employee help me stand. I thanked them and hurriedly left, finally listening to that lizard-brained warning to get out of there.  \n\nWhen I got home, I examined myself in the mirror. I didn’t bother wiping away the subsequent tears. I had, after all, been stabbed or violently probed with *something;* there was a red puncture wound in my neck, rimmed with a weird purplish ring from which trailed similarly colored streaks—*like some kind of bizarre bacterial infection or toxin.*  \n\nIt’s been three hours since confirming the wound, and I’ve started hearing *her* voice in my head. She calls to me, across a distance that seems both vast and close, offering words of comfort and praise—sometimes sounding like a mother, other times like a **lover.** And a certain feeling of affection has blossomed in my heart, a longing for a companionship whose nature feels disturbingly inhuman. I don’t even know her name—they never told me, and I for whatever reason never bothered to ask. And yet I’m starting to think that I love her, that I *need* her, and that she feels the same way about me.  \n\nI have always felt alone and bitter on Valentine’s Day. I don’t feel that way anymore.",

        "text": "I’ve always been clumsy. As a child my legs were decorated by a technicolour masterpiece of bruises and it’s never been unusual for me to spot a cut on the back of my hand or a graze on my elbow and not have the slightest clue where it came from. I think that’s why it took me so long to realise that something wasn’t right. I don’t how long I’d been tripping up over nothing or taking strange routes around my house without thinking anything strange was happening. It wasn’t even like I was the first to notice it.\n\nI was a nanny, back then. The family I worked for had two nanny cams in their house (one in the living room and one in the child’s bedroom) which I was fully aware of and understood completely. Until last December they said they’d never had any reason to check them but when Alex hit her head whilst playing they just wanted to watch exactly what happened for their own piece of mind. I knew I’d done nothing wrong and that the incident had been sadly unavoidable so I was surprised and alarmed when I was asked to come in “for a quick chat” about the tape.\n\nAlex’s mum was a kind but highly strung woman called Rose. She made me tea when I got to the house which made me think that I couldn’t be in that much trouble but she looked incredibly nervous.\n\n“Can I show you?” she asked, gesturing to her laptop.\n\nI nodded and she pressed play at a video that she’d already set up at the correct timestamp. A time which I almost instantly realised was *after* Alex had hit her head.\n\n“Do you know what you did there?” Rose asked.\n\nI did, but I had no particular explanation for it. I started to walk out of the room but jolted as though I’d jammed my toe against something that the camera couldn’t see and then gave this patch of empty carpet a wide berth as I left.  \n\n“There’s nothing there for you to trip up on.” Rose said, “I just didn’t know if this was a sort of balance problem or something. Maybe it’s none of my business. But when I started having problems with my hearing it took months for me to realise and then I looked back at all these strange little things I’d done because of it or to compensate. You should get it checked out.”\n\nI agreed to and left, a little put out. I knew that Rose was unlikely to let me watch the child until I’d gotten these potentially non-existent balance problems seen to. She wouldn’t want to risk me tumbling over for no reason whilst responsible for her child after all. I booked a doctor’s appointment and waited.\n\nI noticed a second episode of whatever was wrong with me before I’d even seen the doctor though. My shoulder brushed against something and although my instinct was merely to lean to the left to avoid it, I caught myself partway through. I raised my right hand to confirm that there was nothing there in the empty air in front of me but it didn’t give me the result I wanted. Instead of confirming the reality that my eyes were feeding me, I felt rough bark pressed against my fingertips. I pushed hard and my fingers sailed on through it but once I brought them to the same space again, the process repeated itself.\n\nNever google your symptoms. This common knowledge is probably almost as widespread as google itself at this point as well as being the mantra of exasperated health professionals everywhere but guess what? I googled what it means when you can feel sensations that aren’t really there. Schizophrenia. Psychosis. Cancer, because it’s always cancer. Some skin conditions showed up but they were much further down the list than these life-altering options and given that the part of my skin that had felt these sensations had no kind of rash or discolouration they didn’t apply to me anyway.\n\nThe doctor did some tests but the results weren’t instant and whilst I waited and waited, incidents kept adding up. It seemed like the more I noticed these sensations, the more I came across new ones. My ankles were scratched by something that felt sharp and clingy like a vine of thorns but when I looked down to see if I was bleeding I realised that there wasn’t a mark at all. The feelings from these things I can’t see seemed to be getting more and more intense whereas I was becoming slowly more numbed to sensations from the visible world. When I was younger I saw a documentary about children who were unable to feel pain and occasionally got injured to such extremes that they lost digits without realising and though I couldn’t understand it then, now it feels far too easy.\n\nThe tests came back negative but given the severity of my symptoms the doctor arranged for me to see a psychiatrist as soon as they next have an opening. He tried his best not to show any worry but his poker face was terrible and even if it hadn’t been, we both know that what’s happening to me isn’t normal. A diagnosis of psychosis or schizophrenia is no doubt on my horizon even though that’d do little to explain why I’ve suddenly started feeling less real sensations as well as more unreal ones.\n\nThe thing is though, being diagnosed with a serious illness doesn’t even worry me at this point. Not when I’ve got bigger things to be scared of.\n\nYou see, whilst the most obvious effect of what has been happening to me is that I’ve been able to notice more things in some other world I think that maybe it has made the other world more able to notice me as well. I feel breathing on my neck sometimes, even though I live alone. Whatever it is often waits until I’m in bed ready to sleep before approaching me and then I feel rhythmic, humid warmth inch from my shoulder across my skin until it reaches my face. Unless something changes it can’t injure me but pain without injury scares me at least as much as the other way around. I have felt the stabbing pain of standing on something sharp or the dull impact of walking into and invisible pillar and even though these things haven’t left a mark they have hurt keenly and I have even felt the itch as a wound that doesn’t even exist begins to heal.\n\nWhatever is hunting me, it probably won’t be able to kill me. But it might be able to make me wish that it could.",

        "text": "Once upon a time, in a small town surrounded by dense woods, there lived a young girl named Emily. She lived a simple life with her parents and younger brother in a quaint house on the edge of town. Emily was known for her love of exploring the woods and discovering new paths and streams.\n\nOne day, while exploring deeper into the woods than she had ever been before, she stumbled upon an old, abandoned cabin. The roof was caved in and the windows were broken, but something about the place drew her in. She cautiously approached the cabin, pushed open the creaky door and stepped inside.\n\nThe inside of the cabin was dark and musty, but as Emily's eyes adjusted to the dim light, she noticed something strange. There were strange symbols and drawings etched into the walls and floor, almost like a child's childish scrawl. Emily's curiosity got the better of her and she began to investigate the drawings.\n\nAs she gazed upon the symbols, she suddenly felt an overwhelming feeling of dread wash over her. She felt as though she was being watched, and a cold breath tickled the back of her neck. She quickly spun around, but there was no one there.\n\nPanic set in as she realized that she was alone in the creepy cabin, surrounded by ominous drawings and the feeling of a malevolent presence. She tried to run out of the cabin, but found that the door was now locked and wouldn't budge no matter how hard she pulled. She was trapped.\n\nAs she frantically searched for another way out, she noticed that the symbols on the walls and floor were beginning to glow with an otherworldly light. Suddenly, she was enveloped in a bright light and transported to another realm.\n\nIn this realm, she was confronted by a figure clad in a hooded cloak. The figure spoke to her in a low, raspy voice, telling her that she was chosen to be the keeper of the cabin and the symbols within it. The figure warned her that the cabin was a gateway to a dark and malevolent world, and that it was her duty to protect it from being opened.\n\nEmily was horrified and begged to be released, but the figure simply laughed and disappeared into the shadows. She was left alone in the realm, her fate sealed as the keeper of the cabin.\n\nYears passed and Emily was never seen again. Some say she still wanders the woods, guarding the cabin and its dark secrets. Others say that she was taken by the dark forces that reside within the cabin. But one thing is certain: whoever enters the cabin never returns, and the symbols etched into the walls continue to glow with an otherworldly light.\n\nTo this day, the cabin remains abandoned and the woods surrounding it are avoided by the townspeople, who whisper about the strange and unexplained occurrences that happen within. They say that if you listen closely on quiet nights, you can hear Emily's mournful cries, warning others to stay away from the creepy cabin in the woods.",

        "text": "I work as a crime scene investigator and let me tell you it’s not as fun or easy as the media portray. Long hours at random locations. Most of which smell horrible. You need to bag everything hoping you picked up something relevant to the case and take at least ten thousand photos at different angles. Not to mention all the sketches and diagrams you need to make with accurate notes. The DNA you send off to be tested doesn’t come back for months and most of the time doesn’t even help the case you’re working on. But it’s a job. Most of my career has been documenting drug dens. Drug crimes in my area are way higher than any other kind. \n\nI was called to a scene of a death caused by unknown circumstances. It was a sight none of us would ever forget. A ghastly scene and we still haven’t been able to unravel the mystery of it. It was a murder. What else could it have been? It wasn’t possible that death happened due to natural circumstances. \n\nI found myself standing beside my boss, burdened with all my gear but for once not feeling the weight. I stared unable to say anything for a few minutes. Out of the hundreds of dead bodies I’ve seen this one stopped me in my tracks. I was looking at a young girl stuck inside a tree. Literally stuck inside a tree. Her upper half limply hanging out with both arms and the rest of her body still inside the tree. There was no hole someone cut to shove her inside. She was too fresh to have the tree grow around her. It was like a video game glitch with an NPC being halfway inside a wall. This was reality and things like this just didn’t happen. \n\nWe did the normal routine of taking photos and documenting the scene. However, everyone was silent. We only spoke when necessary. Something like this was so mind-boggling I felt as if everyone would want to talk about it to get answers. Instead, we all averted our eyes as much as possible from the dead girl. \n\nIn the end, a good chunk of the tree was cut out to retrieve the body. To our horror, there wasn't much left. Only an inch of her body was inside the tree. The rest was missing. It took days to finally painstakingly separate the two of them to find out how little we were working with. I had access to the autopsy photos. For a few hours, I looked through them trying to understand what I was seeing. \n\nThe parts of her that should be inside the tree were missing. It appeared that the wood had naturally grown around her flesh instead of it being perfectly cut away for her. She was easily identified as a teenager who worked a midnight shift at a gas station. Another confusing fact is that her workplace was located two hours away from where she was found dead. And she was on camera leaving the building one hour before she was found. There was simply not enough time to transport her, let alone cut her apart and pose the body. \n\n“Have you ever seen anything like this before?” My boss asked as I was in the station looking over the photos \n\nI really shouldn’t be looking at them as often as I did. There wasn’t must else to learn from just staring at the photos. My boss crossed himself when he looked down at the photos even though it had been ten years since he’d been inside a church. I shook my head. On my time off, I’d been looking up strange deaths online to find nothing like this. Nothing real. Just plenty of fake videos that got my hopes up.  \n\nAn even stranger part of this case was how this was the first time someone asked me anything about it. I was the one pressing others to answers and asking for the photos to study. The office felt so silent and somber. Everyone worked away in hushed tones. I understood that such a terrible thing was enough to unnerve all of us, but everyone working on the case acted as if they were ignoring it. Some leads were being followed up but any time something related to solving what the hell happened to the girl, people became pale and quiet. My boss accepted my head shake as an answer. He gave the photos one last look and left me standing in the break room. \n\nNo one wanted to talk about what happened. And I don’t know if that was the reason why the second death happened. \n\nThe second strange death call ended up being for a body inside a building. The deceased was an elementary school teacher. He was loved by everyone and not a soul had any reason to what him dead. He left behind two children and a loving wife. The problem was, he lived in the next state over. His wife refused to believe it was him until she came down to look at the body. He was asleep next to her, then in the morning, hundreds of miles away stuck inside a parking garage ceiling with parts of him missing.  \n\nThe station worked double time following up on any lead. Every available man stayed late at the station or on the move grasping at any kind of straw possible. Finally, some test results came back. When they landed on our boss’s desk, none of us believed it. The lab tested parts of the tree to see if there was anything inside the wood like glue that may have helped keep the poor girl in place. The results came back as human DNA mixed perfectly with the tree. I noticed the wood looked a bit darker, but how the hell did the DNA get there? Did the blood seep in and stained it somehow? Because of the results, more pieces of the tree were cut out to be tested. \n\nThey kept finding human DAN mixed into the wood. Far too deep for just blood getting slightly absorbed. The traces finally ended and we added how much of the tree had been contaminated. With some effort and math, the lab determined the DNA mixed with wood was equal to the same amount of missing from the girl. \n\nThey then tested the cement of the car garage finding the same results. Again, no one could even begin to offer up theories of how this was possible. It was as if somehow, those bodies became a part of the material they were found inside. \n\nWe were just getting over that shock when the worst happened. Another body had been found. All twisted up like a pretzel inside and outside of the front of a car. My boss wasn’t on the scene but I knew he wouldn’t be. The victim had been identified by him after all. It was his car and his niece. \n\nI’ve met Becky a few times. I didn’t know if I would be able to document the scene if I knew the victim. But I found it like any other job simply because my mind refused to believe this was the same bright and lively girl that attended some Christmas parties. She played piano and my boss always bragged about her. He loved her like a daughter. He and his wife wouldn’t have children, so they spoiled Becky as often as they could. \n\nAnd yet... He walked out of his house to get to work and saw her face half clipped into the front of his car. I don’t know how he would ever be able to get over the grief. A neighboring department took over the case due to how many officers simply could not bring themselves to go to the scene.A floor of support came to the family, and still, not a single person spoke about the details. They all just shook their head with haunted looks on their faces muttering how tragic a young life had been cut short. I felt determined before to solve this case, but now I wanted nothing more but to figure out the reason behind what was happening. \n\nI decided to take copies of the reports home. Every waking hour outside of my normal duties became dedicated to this case without any progress. On my days off I found myself at home staring at the information I already knew completely forgetting to eat. \n\nNo matter if I looked at it from every angle, nothing made sense. There was no method anyone could use to arrange the bodies in the places they were found in. Even if there was, to do so in such a short amount of time was another thing making these cases impossible. I wasn’t ever going to solve this on my own. I needed more eyes on these cases. No one would believe they were real though. \n\nI was staring up at the ceiling, thinking in circles when I heard my doorbell. I sat up, looking down the hallway heart suddenly pounding. No one should be at my door. If I was needed for work, they would just call me. A feeling of dread overtook me when the doorbell rang again. Grabbing my phone in case I needed to call for help, I slowly made my way toward the door. The front door had a frosted window that didn’t let me see who was waiting well enough to know if I was in danger or not. I opened the door only a crack to try and see who might be outside. \n\n“I’m not buying anything.” I said trying to be stern but my voice was shaking. \n\nTwo people stood on my doorstep. One man built like a club bouncer wearing a suit that was far too small for him. Most of his face behind a set of sunglasses. Overall, he looked displeased with the world. The second man was tall but thin. His suit fitted him much better. \n\n“We’re not selling anything. May we come in and talk?” The smaller man asked as he ducked down and brought his face closer to the opening. The action made me step back a little. \n\nHe had a calm smile. And a soft voice that could put anyone at ease. That worried me. There was something too nice about his manner. As if he tried just a little bit too hard to be pleasant. \n\n“No, I don’t think you can come inside.” \n\nI closed the door right away but he already had slipped in a foot to stop me from shutting it. He then got closer as if he wanted to tell me a secret. \n\n“It’s really best for you if we came in to speak about these cases of yours.” The stranger said in a low voice. \n\nOur eyes met and a chill went down my spine. They both had a menacing air about them under all that fake kindness. The fact that they knew about the cases and were wearing suits made me think they were of a higher pay grade than myself. FBI or something like that. I really hoped they were the Feds taking over the case and just dropping by to make sure I stay silent. If I was stupid enough to talk to the wrong person about these cases, I could tip off the killer. And they didn’t know if I was a talker or not. It was a valid theory about who they were, but it all felt wrong. Official agents would have already introduced themselves and shown me badges. They had done neither. Letting them inside was a very bad idea but I felt as if I would get some answers from them regardless of the danger.  \n\nRelaxing my grip, I opened the door and the first man came inside.  \n\nThe second needed to duck down to fit through the frame. I led them to the living room and the thinner one flopped down on the couch, placing one leg over his knee. He looked far too relaxed. The bigger one just stood behind the couch staring. I sat down in my comfy chair I recently found on the side of the road. I noticed the thinner one had cream color hair the same shade as my couch. I’d never seen that shade on someone before. He seemed like the type of guy that companies sent to put forth a good first impression. Soft brown eyes could charm anyone, but I just didn’t trust them. \n\n“I suppose we should make some introductions Mr. Garcia. We know your name and occupation but you don’t know ours. I go by Jackalope, and my friend over there goes by Nessie. Unfortunately, we can’t tell you who we work for or what we do.” He started and gestured a thumb over at the silent man.  \n\n“Jackalope? Is that like, a code name or something?” I asked, eyebrow raised. \n\n“Secret agents have codenames. Do we look like secret agents to you?” Jackalope asked leaning in conspiratorially. It felt like he was teasing me. \n\n“What else should I think?” I replied annoyed. \n\nHe gave his hand a wave and leaned back. At first, I thought he was digging around his pockets for some cigarettes but he pulled out a large round sucker. I waited for him to slowly unwrap it. Once it was in his mouth and his hands in his pocket he carried on. \n\n“Getting down to the reason why we’re here. We work for a company that has an interest in these kinds of cases. We studied them before. They stopped very shortly after we heard about them, and so far, we have not been able to gather that much information.” He explained speaking around his candy. \n\n\"This has happened before? When? Where? How did it stop?” I asked my body starting to tremble over the thought of it all. \n\nThese unnatural deaths happened somewhere else. And they could be stopped. I just needed to know the reason why they started in the first place. \n\n“I can’t outright tell you, but I can give you some hints. We have a working theory of why they stopped, so hint number one. What is the strangest aspect of these cases?” \n\nHe pointed a finger at me while his partner remained silent watching us. It was clear the strangest aspect was the mixture of the DNA and the body's placement. That didn’t explain why they stopped. If someone or something could put them inside solid objects they would keep going. No, what was even stranger than that was the lack of press on these cases. Not a single newspaper printed the story beyond the fact a body was found. These events should be all over the internet and yet not even people working on the cases wanted to speak about them. Whenever my co-workers tried, they got a distant look on their faces and tried to avoid the subject. It was a terrible sight almost beyond human understanding and no one reported about it anywhere. \n\n“No one wants to talk about it.” I said finally. \n\n“Bingo!” \n\nJackalope waved his finger looking happy I arrived at the answer. The more people talked about what was happening, the more it was going to happen. The thought nearly made me sick. I thought of Becky, all twisted inside that car. She was such a kind person and never should have died so soon. If these cases went on more innocent people would become victims of this strange tragedy. \n\n“Are you here to warn me to stop talking about all of this?” I asked meekly. \n\n“What? No! We want you to keep talking. Spread this far and wide. Post this online anywhere you like. It doesn’t matter if people believe you, as long as they know about these cases more is going to occur.” \n\nThe man sounded all too happy to explain the reason for his visit. It made rage boil up inside me. I shot to my feet, knees shaking. \n\n“Do you want people to keep dying?!” I snapped at him. \n\nGiving me another kind smile he waved both his hands to motion me to sit back down. Looking at the bigger silent partner I decided that was best. I could toss Jackalope out, but not the other man. He waited until I felt calmer before speaking again. \n\n“This is going to happen if you speak about it or not. The problem is, we can’t figure out where or when. It happens so randomly we are lucky to be able to arrive here so soon. We just need to study these events while they are going on to solve them. We want to stop them, but that requires sacrifices.” \n\n“I’m not going to sacrifice anyone!” I replied without thinking. \n\nHe looked at me as if he was dealing with a troublesome child. Running a hand through his tied-back hair he paused to try and think of the right words to explain what he wanted to say. I understood what he was getting at but couldn’t stand the thought of it. \n\n“That is a respectable answer. I know you don’t want to be the cause of someone dying. But this could save a lot of people in the future. If we could just study one or two of these events while it was happening, we could put an end to them once and for all. If you can’t burden yourself with this task, we can find someone else. Although, it seems as if you are the only one working on this current set of cases willing enough to do it.” \n\n“Why can’t you two say something then? Scared to get fired or something?” There was more venom in my voice than needed. \n\nI was confused scared and angry. Most of my rage sputtered out when I watched both men look at each other. When Jackalope looked back at me, he had an expression I couldn’t place. Something forlorn and almost distraught. Taking a hold of the stick of his sucker, he bit down and started to chew the remains of his candy making me flinch. \n\n“Do you know why we’re called Nessie and Jackalope? Because those creatures don’t exist.” \n\nI felt a chill go through me as cold brown eyes stared me down. I knew now there was something much more going on than I originally thought. These men may be working for something way bigger than any government. And for a small moment, I didn’t think either of them was human. When the air between us settled Jackalope placed both hands on his knees to start to get up from the couch. \n\n“Well, it’s been nice chatting with you. You have a nice and comfy couch.” Standing up he looked at the other man and gave a silent sign for him to start walking toward the door. \n\n“It’s just an old ratty couch.” I said feeling as if I should correct him on something. \n\n“Sometimes it’s a special thing to become old. And to able to own older items.” He replied with a smile. \n\nHe was strange. I was scared of what he represented but, in a way, I didn’t dislike him. He did his job very well by winning people over with his nature. I walked him to the door, his partner already outside.  \n\n“You don’t need to do this if you find it too difficult. No one would blame you, so don’t worry about it. We’ll find the answer at some point.” Jackalope said pausing at the door. \n\nHe rustled in his suit pocket and took out another sucker, but instead of eating it, he held it out for me to take. He then suddenly leaned in very close and I was positive he was going to unveil some secret knowledge of the case he didn’t want his partner outside overhearing. \n\n“Do you know where to buy the cream flavors of this brand of lollipops? I've been looking all over.” He asked in a low voice. \n\nI brought my hand up to my mouth to turn a small laugh into a cough hoping he didn’t notice. Taking the candy offered I found this man stupid but endearing in a strange way. \n\n“I’ve seen them at the dollar store.” I told him and his face lit up. \n\nGiving me a small wave, he trotted out the front door closing it behind him. I was left in the hallway staring with a sucker in my hand and a lot to think about. \n\nI could be the reason why someone died horribly. And the reason why loved ones would be suffering for the rest of their lives because of the death of another. But if I didn’t do this, then it would just keep happening until someone accepted the hard task of spreading information about these deaths. \n\nI thought about it for a long time. And what was really best in the long run? There was a chance I post this and nothing happens. No new cases come up and it just all ends on its own. While out shopping and still deep in thought, I noticed a small display of the same brand of suckers Jackalope liked. Mixed in were the cream flavors he was after. Buying a few on a whim I decided then and then I would be the one who said something about these cases. Even if only one more person finds out about them, it felt like I was actually doing something. \n\nI’ll update again if any new information comes to light because of my actions.",

        "text": "Hello everyone who comes across this post! I’m newer to reddit because I remember my friend suggesting to share my experiences here. So today’s the day I guess! However, I am writing this as fast as possible for my own safety, so I apologize for any errors I may make..\n\nMy name is Grace, I’m 22 years old, and I own a small business. It’s called GemDust. This online shop sells Random jewelry, fidgets, etc! Valentines day is around the corner and people typically buy these large bags of random things to give to their valentines person.\n\nSo yesterday, (Feb 12th) I got a large valentines order. It was from someone ordering 3 large random bags, and delivered by the morning of Valentines Day. I go to my work office which is literally just the apartment room bought across from mine. I go in my office and start preparing to make this large order, which typically I have a bunch of random toys and little stuffed animals and beads hanging around. Since it’s Valentines theme, I put red and pink colored items in the bags. Including heart confetti and things to make the gift really sparkle. \n\nI finished some orders that I had gotten previously at around 8PM. I had a few orders to do but I figured I would do these tomorrow. I get into something comfortable after I eat dinner, and start to doze off about an hour or so later. \n\nAt around 12PM I hear a knock at my door. I wake up at the sudden noise, and I cautiously walk towards the front door. The peephole is covered so I slowly open the door. No one is there, but there’s a white envelope with a heart on it. I think to myself, there’s no way I had a secret admirer?   I couldn’t tell who it was from, or who it was for, because there was no name on the front. I shut my door and proceed to the living room and sit down on my sofa. I open the letter, it writes:\n\n*Can’t wait to see you soon my dear. \n\nLove, your secret admirer ♡*\n\nThis had to be some joke by my friends or something. This is like some classic horror type stuff you’d see in those movies. But that’s not reality. I decide to burn the card in my fireplace, not thinking anything of it, and going back to sleep.\n\nBy the next morning, (Today) I had finished all my other orders and was able to successfully finish sending them out, but I realized I ran out of confetti and things to tie up the last bag. Of course the last bag was for the person that ordered the three large bags. I needed to go to the craft store to buy more, and I had to be fast because I had to send out these three bags by 6PM or else it would arrive really late tomorrow, possibly not even getting to the person who ordered it. Hobby lobby is around the corner of my neighborhood, so I decide to go there for my craft supplies. I get ready to go out, grabbing my keys and everything, when I notice another heart envelope taped to my door. The note read,\n\n*See you soon~ xoxo*\n\nI look both ways of my apartment hallway, not seeing anyone. I proceed to walk out of my building and head to my car quickly. Who is sending these letters?? Why me??\n\nI start to drive to Hobby Lobby, literally speeding. “No way am I gonna get cursed by this unknown being.” I laughed to myself. I shortly arrived at Hobby Lobby and got out of my car. I looked around and realized, no one was even there. I walked up to the store, and the light were on, and I could see someone at the cashier desk. I proceeded to walk inside.\n\n“Welcome to Hobby Lobby!” The tallish man said smiling. I simply just smiled back. I proceeded trying to find the isle to find confetti supplies, which was near the back of this large store. I go to the isle, and find different types of material I can use for valentines confetti. As I’m looking I can hear slow but loud footsteps in the isle near me. It sounded like they were coming closer. It could just’ve been someone looking for craft things as well, but it was really starting to send chills down my spine. The most bone-chilling part was that the footsteps didn’t even sound like a humans footsteps, they sounded watery, like a reptilian or something similar was walking. Certainly that doesn’t happen though, right? \n\nI stop moving completely while my thoughts and heart are racing. Then all of a sudden I’m frozen in fear. The tallish man I had seen before at the cash register had very large eyes, black ink like substances dripping down from his skull, and he was just staring directly into my eyes about 10 feet away from me. I make eye contact with him for a while, because I was scared that if I even looked away for a second, that would be my death. \n\n“Hello, dear.” He says in a very deep voice. \n\nI got goosebumps from even hearing his voice. This experience was too much, and I couldn’t even seem to form a word. I try to think of a plan to get away from him. I decide that I’ll try to keep eye contact with him, but exit the isle, and run to somewhere safe. So I did. I slowly backed up keeping eye contact with him. He wasn’t moving an inch, keeping that slenderman like pose just staring at me with those horrifyingly red eyes. I exit the isle completely and start sprinting as fast as I could. I ran into the family bathroom, locking myself in there, and hiding in a corner of the bathroom, where I am now as I write to you guys. I’ve been in here for about like.. an hour maybe? It’s 5PM as I’m finishing up this post..\n\nI destroyed the mirror because I’ve heard of it being a gateway for monsters, which has to be some type of joke, but I’m NOT taking any chances. I also used a random metal thing I had in my crossbody bag to hold the door closed more. No one has tried entering the bathroom, but I’m not going out for nobody. I’m unsure what to do next, I’m clearly in danger even if I make it out alive. I’ve called the police line, the one that just sends them to your location, and none of my family members are really close, but I still told them what happened anyways, and my location. I’m unsure where to go from here, but I will hopefully make this out alive somehow. Will update soon maybe?",

        "text": "  \n\nSo I bought a house…\n\nWhen I started working when I was 21, I didn’t think it would take me 11 years before buying my first house. I started saving for it immediately and thought finding a partner to share a house and life with would come as easy. Only it didn’t. Several failed attempts at finding ‘the one’ and 11 years later, I finally decided to buy my own dream house. Or well… The closest thing to it on a one person budget.\n\nThat’s how I became the proud owner of your typical ‘haunted’ house. In reality it’s just a little Victorian house that’s been sitting empty the last couple of years. The previous owners, a couple with a small child, disappeared one day. A search team was put together to sweep the surrounding woods and the entire house was checked for marks of a struggle or any signs that there may have been something suspicious going on. Neither brought something up. \n\nThe couple with child didn’t take any of their stuff, nothing in their rooms had been tampered with as it all stood in their usual place and they had locked the door behind them when leaving. There was no forced entry as all doors and windows were intact. It looked like the family just left and never came back. What made the search harder, was that the couple didn’t have any close relatives that could be questioned for information. It was even only after the kid hadn’t shown up for school that their disappearance got noticed and the emergency services were alerted. After 5 years of not having found any track of the family they were declared deceased by law and the house that had been neglected for the last years because of the lack of any relatives had been put on public sale for almost close to nothing. \n\nOkay I have to admit the circumstances in which the family disappeared were rather mysteriously, but they hadn’t had any real connection to the house, did they? I even went to the city hall to check the public records of the estate and did some googling as well to make sure nothing fishy was going on with the house. My search came up completely empty, there hadn’t been any other people go missing in the neighbourhood, the 3 other houses in the street were very well kept, there hadn’t been any deaths in the house and there was not even a graveyard anywhere near the place. (Don’t judge me, I watched too many horror movies and double checked even though I don’t even really believe in ghosts or spirits) The house was built in 1872 and had once had been the property of a rather wealthy family that regularly threw parties for the entire town. The husband and father had some political engagements in town, but apart from that there wasn’t any information about the house itself. After having found out more about the house and the neighbourhood, I felt save enough to buy it and go live there alone as a single woman.\n\nEven though the house was a fixer-upper, since the previous family had left everything, it came furnished. Having bought the house for very little money and not having to spend anything on furniture, it left me with a big budget to do some renovations.\n\nAfter having removed all of the clutter and obsolete belongings and appliances, I did a deep clean of the house. After a week I had a clean house to start living in while I was doing the actual renovations. While the house had been furnished and the furniture had actually held up rather well against time, the cellar proved a little more difficult as the previous owners had stuffed a lot of their belongings there that weren’t worth anything to me together with a lot of foods that had gone way over their expiration dates. It was not the hardest work, but it was a dirty job. Luckily the attic made up for it since there had been few possessions on it and the ones that were, proved to be worth some money. After a couple of weeks of hard work and booking some progress, I still hadn’t stumbled upon weird or creepy situations in my house, so I guessed it really wasn’t going to be a haunted house. \n\nI started seeing the 3 other neighbours now and then while bringing construction waste to the big container outside or when I went on trips to the supermarket or construction store, although that didn’t happen too often since all of them were rather reserved. Two of the three other houses on the street laid a few hundred meters away from mine, so it was not like we saw much of each other anyway. In the first one lived a 50 year old man whose kids had moved away to the other half of the world. So he spent most of his time in the local pub in town, drinking away his time. In the second lived a retired couple that didn’t get much outside time and I mostly got to know about them because of the home care employee that came over every morning and evening to help them with their daily needs. The third house was the only one close to mine and belongs to an elderly but very active and very pleasant lady named Mildred and her less active husband George. They’re the only neighbours I know by name, although I have only seen Mildred in the flesh. She tells me a lot about her husband George, but sadly his health isn’t what it was and most of the days he’s bedridden. Luckily he has Mildred to take care of him and they seem like a very happy couple that have had a very jolly life together. Because of that Mildred doesn’t come out as often as she did when they were younger, but she doesn’t seem to mind.\n\nAfter almost a year of renovations, it was finally completely ready. I threw a big housewarming party for all my friends and family that I had missed the past year because I put most of my time and energy in the house. It was so good to see everyone and they all complimented me on a job well done. I invited the other neighbours but the ones further down the street couldn’t make it. Mildred was another case though…\n\nShe didn’t only come to the housewarming party and chatted up all my guests, she also prepared some fresh beef stew for all of them. George must’ve had a better day I thought, because he had helped her prepare it, Mildred said. It must hurt seeing your partner, that you have spend a lifetime with, deteriorate and turn into an empty shell of the man he once was. It was in moments like this, watching Mildred talk about her husband with both love and hurt written in her eyes at the same time, that I was not jealous of the people that had found their forever love. But when she started talking about how she had enjoyed cooking together and that it made up for all the lost time and all the things they couldn’t do together anymore, that feeling quickly disappeared as she seemed genuinely happy and content with her life, while I was still stuck in a perfect house without anyone romantically interested in me to share it with.\n\nIt’s true when they say that food prepared with love tastes better, because we had quickly ran out of the delicious stew with the softest buttery pieces of beef and even though Mildred denies it, I suspect some pieces of smoked bacon as well. She even offered to get some more, but I felt bad depriving her of the entire batch of stew she and George must have put a lot of work into. My cousins thought differently because when Mildred offered to get some more, they volunteered to help her carry. I followed them to her house because I wanted to make sure the savages didn’t help her out of her entire stock. She opened her front door, which was still unlocked. I remember feeling worried about Mildred because even though we live in a quiet and calm neighbourhood, it’s not safe to keep your doors unlocked nowadays. I mean, it’s 2018 not the 1800’s…. Certainly not as an old fragile lady living with a man that can’t defend himself. I made a mental note to warn her about her vulnerability later as I didn’t want to ruin the light mood.\n\nIt’s then when she stepped inside and took a very thick heavy iron key out of her pocket to unlock her basement where she had put the stew, that it struck me as an odd thing. Who leaves their front door unlocked, but then locks their cellar? She opened the door to the cellar, which was made out of uneven concrete walls and a low ceiling, with  no natural light and little to no artificial light and a moisty feel. It made it look and feel like a cave a bit. Only this cave actually smelled like the heavenly bacon beef stew we had just been served. She prompted my two cousins and me to go down there, but it didn’t feel right to do so. I hesitated to enter the house while my cousins were making their way over towards the stairs. Mildred must’ve sensed my dubious feeling and tried to encourage me by saying “Oh, no worries honey, George is just down there taking care of the stew and stirring the pot, he’ll give you guys a generous portion.” It was like my cousins were in a trance because they blindly followed her instruction and started to descend the stairs with the empty pot. \n\nIt was like there were physical alarms going off, but it must’ve been just in my head because I was the only one feeling the uneasy feeling of something being completely off about this situation. Didn’t Mildred just unlock the door to the cellar? Why would she do that if George had been there maintaining the bacon beef stew? How would an old man that could barely leave his bed even suddenly be able to take some very crooked, narrow, wet steps downstairs? And if he had been having such a good, active day, why hadn’t he come with Mildred to the party? I tried warning my cousins by yelling at them to get out, but before a sound could escape my mouth, Mildred just slammed the door in my face. Through the pane of glass beside the front door, I saw my cousins descend the stairs without even looking back to what had just happened and Mildred staring at me with a wicked smile on her face.\n\nI couldn’t believe what was happening and started to hyperventilate. In the few seconds I still had some sort of a sane mind, I called emergency services. How long it took for the police and the ambulance to arrive, I have no clue because I spent the entire time having a panic attack while constantly running around the house looking for other ways to enter, without any result. When the police arrived they took over and forcefully entered the house when Mildred didn’t give any attention to their warnings.\n\nI often think of that moment as the last moment I was able to think like a sane person. Because what happened just a few minutes later has completely paralysed me and made me rethink everything I ever believed to be true about this world. The police officers searched the entire house but found no persons, not my cousins, not Mildred or George. What’s even worse is they didn’t find any sign of anyone actually having lived there recently, neither was the house furnished, there were no appliances and there hadn’t been any pots of stew in the cellar or anywhere else in the house for that matter. What they told me was impossible to process because I had just seen my cousins go in with my neighbour that I had talked to multiple times and had seen busy in and around her house. I had been circling the property to check for other entries, so they couldn’t have gotten out without me noticing. One of the police officers turned out to be a local who knew the estate belonged to some old rich guy who thought the estate was beneath his status but had kept to it all the same because it was the house he grew up into with his mother. Since his mother had passed around 7 years earlier, he didn’t have the heart to sell the house so he had kept it well preserved and looked after even though he never had any intention to sell or rent the place.\n\nThe paramedics took me to the hospital for a mental check and drug test and submitted me for observation. It was only when the other guests at the party had confirmed seeing Mildred, hearing her talk about her husband George, having eaten the bacon beef stew and seeing me and my cousins leave to her place to get some more, that they released me from the hospital and started to investigate the situation. I described Mildred as best as I could, but apart from what I remember her looking like, I didn’t have anything to go from. I never got her last name, neither did they have family that ever visited or a caregiver checking in on them. The other neighbours couldn’t describe her either as they had never even really known who lived there and hadn’t seen the inhabitant of the house outside in all that time. The police put up a local warrant but no one recognised the woman, neither did she get spotted in the months after that. \n\nI tried living with what had happened that day but everything I thought or did had the event bleeding through it. I couldn’t just let it go and I had to try to make sense of it. The searching stopped after a week and the missing posters and warrants disappeared 3 months later. After 6 months had passed they released the estate from being a crime scene. For some reason I had to see the space my cousins went into for myself and found myself on the porch of the house later that evening. Just as the day of my party, the front door was unlocked so I pushed it open. I was hoping not to run into any trouble, be it encountering Mildred or stumbling upon a locked up cellar just like that day.\n\nI tried the door of the cellar. It didn’t open, it was stuck. Just my luck, the door being locked… After realising this meant I wouldn’t be able to see the space where my cousins had disappeared, I tried to make peace with this information. A small part of me wanted to return home and come back with a crowbar, but the police hadn’t found anything 6 months earlier just after everything happened, so it was stupid of me for having had hoped that I would find anything today. I turned back towards the front door and was halfway through the doorframe when something caught my eye. On the ground, there was lying a thick heavy iron key…\n\nI didn’t know if it had been there just seconds before and if it hadn’t, if this meant anything bad was about to happen. Against better judgement I took the key and unlocked to door to the cellar. It looked exactly like I remembered with the crooked concrete steps and glistering uneven walls. A cold, wet, musky breeze passed me and it wasn’t anything like the nice warm brothy smell of bacon beef stew that had been lingering in the air that day. The cave cellar was completely dark and I didn’t find any light switch, so I turned on the torch on my phone. It didn’t really give me a clear view of the entire room, but I could see where I was putting my feet and that was enough. After descending the stairs, while still having to crouch a bit because of the low ceiling, I gathered my surroundings. I almost dropped my phone once I realised what I was seeing. \n\nThe room was filled with big sterilised glass jars of stew similar to the beef stew we had eaten half a year earlier. I felt bad that my first instinctive thought was about how buttery that smoked bacon had tasted in the stew. The mouth-watering memory didn’t last long as the feeling was replaced with the eerie feeling that something was not right at all. What was going on? These jars hadn’t been here when the police searched the property, why where they here now? I had the feeling a mouse must have the moment a trap slaps shut. I had the feeling I wasn’t getting out of this house anymore and the only thing I could do was try to run back out of the house, towards safety. I grabbed the nearest jar of stew as proof since I wasn’t going to leave this place empty-handed and ran back towards the stairs. It felt like a force was pulling me back in, but I fought against it and put all the power I had in my muscles to keep me going forward. \n\nOnce I reached the top of the stairs the force felt weaker but was still there. It was only when I made my way out of the house that I felt the force fall away completely. I took the jar to my place and called the police once again. When they searched the house it was once again completely empty and deserted. They took the jar and had the contents analysed. Another case was opened a few days later as it turned out that the soup had contained human meat. They still had to check the DNA against missing people cases but so far they had discovered some of the remains to belong to both of my cousins, 5 other people from missing people cases in the past 10 years all over the country and even the remains of a guy called George Oldwin Owens who had disappeared over 20 years ago. I started to feel unwell… Not only did my cousins turned out to be killed or did George turned out to have never existed as Mildreds husband, we had actually consumed the beef stew and lots of it as well. My stomach turned inside out thinking about how the buttery smoked meat had never been bacon after all… I threw up.\n\nThe case got some national attention and was branded the ‘Bacon beef stew murder case’ although there was much debate to whether it could be called murder when all the evidence had disappeared twice under seemingly paranormal concurrences. After a few days another hit had come up in the missing persons database based on the human remains in the stew. It turned out to be mother of the family that had previously lived in the house I currently owned and lived in.\n\nA few months later the case blew up and it got the official paranormal stamp when a police officer of a few towns south had found articles about a witch-hunt dating back to the 1600’s. There had been several disappearances throughout the ages and multiple of them could be traced back to a woman who went by the name of Mildred. When the officer had found an estimated look of this witch Mildred, it looked a disturbingly lot like the sketch I had made by describing my neighbour.\n\nThere were some sources who described the witch Mildred, who was put up for trial by being burned at the stake. Only she didn’t seem to die. She did burn alright, and the town square supposedly smelled like smoked pig’s meat but she didn’t die. When the fire went out the next morning, she had completely disappeared without leaving a trace. The town didn’t escape her wrath and the entire town was burned down a week later. \n\nAfter that she didn’t seem to have made any appearances in the neighbouring villages. She was forgotten for a while. People started to disappear but often without leaving any traces, as so many still do, be it by Mildred’s doing, because of some freak accident, or any other creepy weirdo. The few times a women called Mildred was mentioned, they didn’t link it with the witch Mildred a few hundred years before. The only article written that mentions both the disappearances, the woman Mildred and link them to the witch Mildred was written by a man that was admitted to the mental hospital a month later and didn’t get any credibility, while he should’ve. \n\nI’m sitting here a year later, writing all of this down because I’m trying to make sense of all of this. I wouldn’t have thought to start to believe in immortal witches by the age of 33, yet here we are. I still don’t know how all of it worked, how she disappeared with my cousins in the blink of an eye, without leaving any trace, or how the jars were back there 6 months later, but also weren’t there anymore barely 20 minutes later when the police checked. It still feels like the front door was unlocked on purpose, as was the door to the cellar locked on purpose, the key to it planted there on purpose, all to lure me in. I don’t know if she meant for me to see all of it and escape it, or if she meant for me to get trapped down there at the time. I don’t know how this world works, but I what I do know is that it’s not to be understood by us mortals. I’m sorry if I’m sounding a bit melancholic. It’s just that my own cellar has been starting to smell like buttery smoked bacon and I suspect I won’t outrun it this time.",

        "text": "It was rumored to be haunted, and I had always wanted to explore it. So one day, I decided to gather up the courage and go inside.\n\nAs I approached the house, I noticed that the gate surrounding it was rusted and the windows were boarded up. The once-beautiful mansion now looked like a scene straight out of a horror movie. But I was determined to find out what lay within.\n\nI pushed the gate open and stepped inside. The overgrown lawn was littered with broken bottles and discarded newspapers. The front door was slightly ajar, and as I pushed it open, I was greeted by a musty smell. The inside was dark, and I could hear the sound of something scratching at the walls. I was filled with a sense of unease, but I continued on.\n\nAs I made my way through the house, I noticed that everything was covered in a thick layer of dust. The furniture was overturned and there were holes in the walls. But the strangest thing was that there were no cobwebs or signs of any living creatures, like mice or insects. It was as if time had stopped inside the house.\n\nI finally made my way to the staircase, and as I began to ascend, I heard a faint whisper. I paused and listened, but the whisper had stopped. I shrugged it off and continued up the stairs, but as I reached the top, I heard the whisper again, this time, it was louder and more distinct.\n\nI followed the whisper down a long, dark corridor, and as I approached the end of the hallway, I saw a figure standing in front of me. It was a woman dressed in a long, white gown, and her eyes were black and empty. She whispered my name, and I felt a chill run down my spine.\n\nI tried to run, but I was frozen in place. The woman began to float towards me, and as she got closer, I could see that her skin was rotting, and her hair was matted and tangled. I was filled with terror and I screamed, but no sound escaped my lips.\n\nSuddenly, the woman vanished, and I was left alone in the dark hallway. I stumbled back, and as I reached the top of the stairs, I tripped and fell down the stairs, landing in a heap at the bottom. I tried to get up, but I was too scared to move.\n\nI lay there for what felt like hours, until finally, I mustered up the courage to stand. I made my way back to the front door, and as I stepped outside, I felt a rush of relief. But as I walked down the street, I realized that the woman was following me, her ghostly figure appearing and disappearing behind me.\n\nI ran as fast as I could, but no matter how fast I ran, the woman was always right behind me. I eventually made it home, and I locked the door behind me, but I could still feel her presence.\n\nFrom that day on, I was haunted by the woman in the white gown. Everywhere I went, she was there, following me, whispering my name. I tried to tell people about what had happened, but no one believed me.\n\nAnd so, I lived the rest of my life in fear, always looking over my shoulder, always hearing that whisper, always feeling the presence of the ghostly woman in the white gown.",

        "text": "*“Alexa, play Dave Matthews Band.”*\n\nI’m sure Thomas Lanning would have chosen something cooler to play had he known those were going to be the last words which ever came out his mouth. \n\nThomas didn’t know that I was hiding in the closet in his living room when he came home from work. He didn’t know that I was fully geared up to kill him and discreetly disposed of his body. He didn’t know I was capable of violent things. \n\nWhat he did know was he had murdered my sister Tina six years before. I’m sure it was one of the last things he thought of before I strangled him in his living room. \n\n\\-\n\nI bought a bottle of whiskey I couldn’t afford as soon as I was sure Thomas was responsible for my sister’s murder and planned to open it once he was dead. I cracked the bottle open and poured a glass once I finished disposing of Thomas’ body somewhere no one would ever fucking find it. \n\nI was on my second sip when an email flashed across my phone which stole my attention. \n\nThe email came from mountainfortune@gmail.com \\- subject Re: What you did to Thomas\n\nThe title made my entire body go cold even though I had just taken drinks of warm whiskey.\n\n*I know what you did to Thomas Lanning. There’s more that happened with your sister than you realize. Things will not end well for you. However, there is still a chance you can make it through this. Please visit me at Mountain Fortune Palm Reading as soon as you can.* \n\n*Krystal*\n\nThe message was unbelievable. Yet, I couldn’t argue against something that seemed to know exactly what I had just done. \n\nI drove out to Mountain Fortune Palm Reading, which in fact was at the foothills of the mountains. A dumpy house covered in moss and algae with one pathetic sign. It didn’t instill confidence in me that I wasn’t about to be murdered. \n\nThe rich scent of cheap perfume greeted me when I walked up onto the rickety porch and rang the doorbell, which didn’t work. The door opened just after I took my finger off it anyway. \n\nKrystal looked just how I thought she would - saggy face, crispy blonde hair, dressed in what looked like a pile of blankets. She reminded me of the women you’d find smoking cigarettes out in front of the bars in my rural hometown, just a little younger, probably in her 30s.\n\nShe ushered me into a dark room with a cheap crystal ball in the middle and I wondered if Krystal was her real name or if it was some kind of unoriginal fortune teller double entendre. \n\nI sat down on a broken futon covered in a red blanket and started grilling Krystal about what this all about. I think I caught her off-guard. I think she thought she was going to be calling the shots. \n\nHer explanation was simple. She was an actual psychic and she knew what I did before I even did it and what was going to happen to me and for whatever reason she decided she wanted to help me, but now she regretted it, given my attitude. \n\nI got frustrated and started to leave. \n\n“Your sister was going to kill Thomas,” Krystal said before I got to the door. \n\n This sounded ridiculous, yet, it compelled me to stay and keep hearing her out. \n\n“Thomas came to me because he cheated and wanted to see how his future looked when he broke it to Tina. I knew he was coming. The intense future of him and Tina had struck me from across the town. Things happen that way with me. I’m like an animal before an earthquake arrives, when something big happens in this town, I feel it coming,” Krystal explained. \n\nI sat down again. \n\n“I saw what your sister was going to do after Thomas told her he had cheated on her with one of her friends. She was going to kill herself. She was going to seamlessly make it so Thomas would get blamed. She mapped it all out,” Krystal went on.\n\nI hated it but I couldn’t say it didn’t sound like my sister. She was calculating. She was vengeful. I loved her, yet there was no denying that was the kind of thing she might consider.\n\n“It was too late for Thomas by the time this all came together for me. Your sister was up in the mountains, ready to kill herself, and set it up to make it appear Thomas had done it. His only choice was to try and get to where she was as fast as he could,” Krystal explained. \n\nI obviously had some follow up questions to this. Krystal could see what happened. Thomas went up into the mountains where my sister had taken Thomas’ car and his hunting shotgun and was putting together how exactly she was going to shoot herself and fall down a cliff. There was no way Thomas wasn’t going to be blamed for her death, if they ever found her body all the way at the bottom of the ravine.\n\nThomas got there just before Tina was about to do it. She panicked when she saw him, and she slipped off the rocks by accident. There was no way Thomas was ever going to be able to prove that though. \n\nKrystal also knew something else. She could see that my sister wasn’t actually going to go through with it all. \n\n“Wait. Wait. My contact with the police department told me they had Thomas through D.N.A? The 23 and Me database thing,” I rebutted Krystal, finally.\n\n“You think these local cops got anything figured out? I already know what happens. They don’t have enough to convict him. They never did. They always had his D.N.A. That doesn’t change much,” Krystal said. \n\nKrystal started to appear annoyed. I started to feel uneasy, in the big picture and the small picture. *Was she going to harm me right then and there? What was going to happen to me now that I had killed Thomas? How had I not thought this all out?* \n\n“Everything was going to be what it was. Thomas was never going to prison, but he was going to spend the rest of his life sad and regretful. Now you messed that up and you’ve messed yourself up,” Krystal said, trailing off at the end.\n\nI started to get the feeling Krystal didn’t want me there anymore. I didn’t like it but I was also worried about what she might do. \n\nI started to leave, but stopped myself at the door. \n\n“What happens to me now?” I asked Krystal, who had walked up behind me. \n\nShe hesitated and looked away. I hated that. \n\n“I don’t know now. You’ve altered the way things were supposed to be,” Krystal said. “It takes a while to reset, and it might not at all. I may have lost the thread.”\n\nI was going to ask more. \n\n“I think you should go now.”\n\n\\-\n\nI couldn’t sleep. I kept waiting to hear sirens approach - see those red and blue lights through the cracks in the blinds in my windows. I felt the impending doom of my life suffocating me. \n\n*How had I been so greedy and stupid?* Even if Thomas did deserve it, and apparently he didn’t, how could I have thought I could just get away with revenge murdering another person?\n\nI got in my car and drove back to Krystal’s in the middle of the night. \n\nI didn’t knock on the front door. I didn’t even go onto the front porch. I thought the back would be a better way to break in. I didn’t remember seeing any cameras or security systems. \n\nThere was a window open in the back. No screen. Low enough and large enough for me to slip through. \n\nSoon I was in the darkness of Krystal’s home. Unlike her with me - I knew my own plan and future. \n\nWhat she didn’t know was that I had a gun. She also didn’t know that I had found her bedroom and slipped inside. She didn’t know I was standing right next to her bed as she slept. \n\nShe didn’t know anything until I slipped a handcuff onto one of her wrists, the other of which was attached to mine, and she stirred - slowly waking up. \n\nShe woke up with my gun in her face and orders from me. I needed her help to aid me in doing everything I could to correct the mistakes I had made and save my future. \n\nShe kept claiming because I broke the proper chain of death that she couldn’t tell me my future. I didn’t believe her. *Try harder, please.*\n\nShe said she started to get bits and pieces. I was going to get caught for killing Thomas because his body was going to surface. She knew I had buried him at sea. This was a great sign. Only I knew that and was worried I hadn’t done a good enough job. \n\nI got in my boat and went out into the sound where she told me he was going to be found. \n\nKrystal told me Thomas’ body had been caught on the line for a crab fishing pot out in the sound. The crab fisherman would pull him up with their line in a week and it would lead to my unraveling and eventual imprisonment. \n\nThat was all she could see. She couldn’t see anything else. Being on a boat in the frozen night didn’t help any of this she said. \n\nWe pulled the crab pot up and she was right. Thomas was attached to the bottom of it, some crabs trapped in the pot had even already started to go to work on him. \n\nWe got him up into the boat and I quickly improvised a new location that would be even harder to have him wash up from. It wasn’t easy though, especially because Krystal got sea sick and vomited all over my boat. \n\nI felt confident I had done everything the right way this time. I felt as well as I could as we got back into my car to drive home. \n\nEverything seemed relatively okay until I noticed Krystal was crying. \n\n“I fucking hate you,” Krystal muttered, quietly, but loud enough so I could hear. \n\nShe started to break down too hard to say any more, but I could feel an anger radiating inside the cab of the car. \n\n*“You’re a fucking asshole.”*\n\nAt first I thought she was talking about being mad at Thomas. Then I felt her hand latch onto my side. She squeezed my body hard, to the point it hurt. \n\nKrystal was magical and skilled. I got a rush of vision while driving as she dug her nails into me. I saw Krystal and Thomas kissing. I saw them fucking. I saw them lying in bed together. *In love*. \n\nI felt Thomas’ guilt. I could see him. It was back when he was young. When he was with my sister. I heard snippets of Krystal and Thomas talking. How he was going to break it to Tina he cheated on her. \n\n*Except Thomas had cheated on her with Krystal*. Krystal was the other girl. \n\nKrystal and Thomas had fallen in love, but she was heartbroken. She could see the future of it all. \n\nBut here’s what I felt from her I don’t think she meant to share. I could feel that Krystal could affect these outcomes - she could influence minds. Case in point, I could feel her trying to get myself to drive up into the mountains and kill myself. \n\nI fought it. It wasn’t easy. She was strong. She had put so many things into motion. It turned out she may have been the monster in all these things or at least the catalyst. Greedy. I think she just fell for Thomas and wanted it to work out and was willing to make it happen. \n\n*Stop. Stop.* I had to keep fighting her. And that I did. I pushed her hand off of my side and slowed the car. \n\nThen I felt the car start to speed. I looked down and my foot was mashed on the gas even though that was not my intention. \n\nKrystal had her hand on the back of my neck, squeezing hard. I could feel the control of my body slipping away like she was strangling me to death. \n\nI just let go of the steering wheel - I let Jesus take the wheel, per se. \n\nJesus crashed us into a tree. \n\n\\-\n\nI blacked out for a few seconds and woke up behind the wheel. Krystal was in the passenger seat - I couldn’t tell if she was knocked out or dead or wide awake. \n\nI didn’t care. I didn’t waste time and ran away from the scene. \n\nI did shoot one look over my shoulder and thought I saw Krystal stirring out of the car. \n\n\\-\n\nI went home. I thought I was going to die, and for a lot of reasons. \n\nI met up with my friend in the police department. We talked about how I was going to be able to safely get myself out of what happened. \n\nIt appears it worked. It’s been years. Everyone was sure Thomas killed my sister so his disappearing felt perfect for everyone in the community. Everyone wanted him dead. No one cared. \n\nKrystal went missing. I don’t think anyone noticed. The shitty little fortune teller building at the edge of town was abandoned and fell into disrepair. No one gave half a shit. \n\nI went on with my life and have felt a little more normal every day that went by. But there is always something tickling at me. \n\nI’ll feel like I lose control sometimes. I’ll feel like I want to jump off a bridge or drive into traffic or go turn myself in for what I did to Thomas. \n\nAnd I’ll know where it is coming from. *Krystal is out there somewhere.* \n\nI’ve searched the internet up and down and again and found no trace of her, but I know she’s alive and I know she’s the only one who knows what happened. \n\n*And she might be the only one who knows what happens for me from here.*",

        "text": "“Being forgotten”, I sighted, “that’s my biggest fear. There. You happy now?”\n\nTim laughed. “Shit, that’s so weird. Mine is waking up without my dick.”\n\nI rolled my eyes. I was not very fond of this dude. The only member of our group I found more irritating was Laurie, Julia’s girlfriend, who was currently walking in zig-zag-lines while pouring all her energy in a song I had never heard before. I knew I should try to like her. She was dating my best friend, after all. But at this point, she was definitely too drunk for a conversation.\n\n“Drowning in a sea of piss”, was Julia’s contribution to the conversation. Laurie started laughing so hard, she almost tripped.\n\n“Careful”, I caught her by the arm, “don’t fall into the river.”\n\nShe just scoffed and threw back her long, blonde hair. “Whateves. The... the current ain… ain’t even that strong.”\n\nShe was right. The river floated peacefully through the night. The ships that transported goods to the nearby chemical-company were long gone. All that was left was the quacking of a frog, and the factory lights, which shone warmly in the distance, reflecting onto the black water. \n\nDespite looking nice in the dark, this company was the reason we were once officially crowned “Germany’s ugliest city”. I sighted. Soon, we would escape from here. We had just graduated, and we would study in Hamburg or Berlin. Julia and I would share a flat, like we always planned on, and we would go to parties and bicker over the groceries, and I would learn to get along with Laurie, and we would watch Julia's stupid British shows every evening. Julia would become a graphic designer and I would start my own company. We would do something with our lives. We wouldn’t be forgotten. And we would never return to this shithole of a town.\n\n“Bro, am I the only one who could take a swim right now?”, Tim asked.\n\nJulia and I exchanged a look. We had done these walks for a while now, especially during lockdown when there was nothing else to do. However, there had always been one rule.\n\nDon’t go for a swim. \n\nI never got why our parents were so pressed about that. Yes, there were very strong currents in the middle of the river, but as long as you stayed along the shore… \n\nI mean, I even looked it up. Many people drown in the “Rhein”, especially when it floods. But the part of the river we walk… there has never been an accident. Not a single one. But still…\n\n“I don’t think we should”, I looked at the black water, “I mean, we don’t even wear swimsuits, and…”\n\n“Oh, come on, Emma”, Laurie clung to Julia’s arm, pulling her towards the water, “it… it will be fun, we… we will… we will…”\n\n“God, you are too drunk for this”, Julia interfered, but she was laughing. \n\nTo my surprise, Tim hesitated as well. “Shouldn’t we…”\n\n“Timothy”, Laurie smiled, “I would *really* appreciate it if you came along.”\n\nHe nodded, eager to please her. Laurie had this… effect on people. Not on me though. Aroace and proud. Therefore, I observed with a mix of confusion and amusement how Tim nearly drooled over the beautiful blonde. Tonight, Laurie’s powers were strong. Almost scary when you think about it. \n\nThe things that people do for love.\n\n“Yeah, sure”, Tim took off his shirt and pants. I frowned. It was a breezy night, but his hairs were not standing. It almost… it almost looked like he was sweating.\n\n“What about you, Emma?”, Laurie’s voice was like silk. I shook my head. “I’d rather…”\n\n“Come on”, she came closer, “be a good girl for me, wouldn’t you?” \n\nFrom one moment to the next, her drunkenness had disappeared.\n\nI bit my lip. “I’d rather not.”\n\nLaurie ran her fingers through her perfect hair. The curls shone in the moonlight. \n\nWhat a beautiful girl. \n\nBut when she looked at me through her long, black eyelashes, a shiver suddenly came down my spine.\n\n“Emma”, she said, “be a good friend.”\n\n“Please, Ems”, Julia begged.\n\n“I… I…”, why was I stuttering, “don’t you think it is…”\n\nLaurie’s voice dropped three octaves. “Swim with us.”\n\n“*Fine*.” The words escaped me before I knew it. I frowned. Why the fuck did I say that? Laurie gave me one last perfect smile before she turned around. I realized the little hairs on my neck were standing up. Why the hell was I so intimidated by this girl? Right now, she was walking towards the water in zig-zag lines, for God’s sake.\n\n'I should probably go with them anway', I thought. After all, I was the most sober. And the only certified lifeguard.\n\nSo, I undressed while Laurie and Julia were walking into the river slowly. Strange. Under the moonlight, it almost looked like they were dancing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe water was as cold as you would expect it. For a moment, it took my breath away. Then, I began to swim, enjoying the feeling of warm muscles against the cold surrounding me. Julia and Laurie were a few meters in front of me, Tim behind. I heard him splashing around like a fucking idiot. Weirdly enough, the sound got louder...\n\nI turned my head. He was catching up really, really fucking fast. The water got into his mouth and eyes, but he didn’t even blink. He just kept staring at Laurie. \n\nI am an excellent swimmer, but it only took him a few seconds to bypass me. I stared ahead. To where he was going. \n\nLaurie and Julia were so close to each other that their hair almost touched. As I watched, Laurie leaned sideways and kissed her girlfriend. The water carried Julia’s giggle.  \n\nAnd they were heading right towards the currents.\n\nWhat the hell?\n\n“Stop”, I screamed, “guys, this is dangerous! Julia, please, stop it, please!\"\n\nTim had almost caught up with them. His movements were perfect. The girls were now right were the current pulled the hardest. I could see the water floating around them, but weirdly enough, they didn't move one bit. They only had eyes for each other. And Tim was catching up.\n\n“No, wait”, I yelled, “stay along the shore, Tim, you have too…”\n\nBut he didn’t listen. It was like his eyes were glued to Laurie. Like he needed to reach her, no matter what.  \n\nHe was still gargling, and spluttering, but he never took his eyes off her. \n\nAnd then, he opened his mouth.\n\n \"I do not know what it might bode\", he sang. His voice was thin, but the water carried it well enough that I recognized Laurie's song.\n\n\"That I should be so sad.\"\n\nLaurie turned around. In the darkness, her perfect white teeth shone bright. They were many of them.\n\nToo many.\n\n“Tim!”, I gritted my teeth and swam faster, trying to reach him before Laurie did, \"Julia! you need to come back. GUYS PLEASE!\"\n\nTim turned his head, and for a split-second, the haze lifted. I saw the fear in his eyes.\n\n\"A fairytale from long ago\", he whispered, \"now will not leave my head.\"\n\nThen, the current took him.\n\nI screamed as he was swept under water. Soon, his head appeared again, his eyes glued straight to Laurie. He got carried downstream, faster and faster.\n\n“Swim!”, I yelled, “you need to..”\n\nWHACK.\n\nI will never forget that sound. Tim’s body had gotten smashed against something. When I squinted, I saw the tip of a rock looking out from under the water. \n\nA *bloody* tip.\n\nTim went limp, and the current got one final hold of him. The only thing that was still moving was his head. Twisting and twisting, eager to get one final glimpse of Laurie. The spot that was his auburn hair got smaller and smaller as he disappeared into the night. \n\nA giggle echoed across the water. A girl's voice.\n\n“Julia”, I whirled around, “what the fuck is happening? We need to get out of the water! We need to…” \n\nI stopped. \n\nThey were gone.\n\nI looked around. Suddenly, a slight breeze came up. It dryed my salty face. i hadn't realized I had been crying. The wind was almost peaceful. Like it was wispering to me. I shivered. Humming a song as old as time, a song that had been forgotten for too long, the...\n\nThe moment I realized that there was a reason the humming sounded so muffled, something gripped my foot. \n\nAnd then, there was only the endless black and cold. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI screamed. Water filled my lungs, but I just couldn’t stop. The force was pulling me down further and further, until my the pressure hurt my ears and the night became a distant memory.\n\nSuddenly, the pulling stopped. I was alone in the cold. And my head was hammering. I needed air. I wouldn’t make it. I would die down her. A lifeguard, drowning. For making an idiotic choice. I was not ready. We weren’t. We were meant to go to university together. University. So many dreams. All the chances we never got, all the...\n\n*Stop.* \n\n*You have to relax.* \n\n*Save your energy.*\n\nMy swimming-instructors voice. He had been an old, fat man who ironically drowned in his own bathtub blackout drunk. But his voice was everything I had. So I forced myself to relax my muscles. Pretend to be dead. \n\n*Open your eyes. If the surface is right below you, use it to push yourself up.* \n\nSo I did.\n\nAnd I almost started to scream again.\n\nThe surface *was* right below me. But it was not rock.\n\nYou could never imagine the sheer *mass* of bodys,\n\nMost of them were skeletons. A fundament of bones cementing the river.\n\nSome were… fresher.\n\nMy eyes focused on an old man's body not far away from me. His arm had seemingly been caught under a staple of rib-cages. The dead body was all bloated and floating, his hair swaying around his head, moved by the current in a never-ending, rhythm.\n\nBut his face was more relaxed than mine He almost seemed… content.\n\nI bit my lip and finally looked down at the boney hand that was holding my foot.\n\nLaurie smiled back at me. Her teeth were tiny and sharp, and they were so, *so* many of them. She was almost as thin as the skeletons. Every bone poked out under her white skin.\n\nA glow came from within her, an enarmoring, light glow that revealed the black blood cursing htorugh her veins.\n\nBut somehow, her smile was still beautiful.\n\nJulia at her side was drawn to it. My friend was turning very, very blue, but she did not seem to mind. She was caressing Laurie’s beautiful golden hair while humming a long-forgotten melody.\n\nLaurie locked eyes with me. \"Emma, my little swimmer”, she gurred, her voice echoing through the water, “finally where you're meant to…”\n\nI kicked her in the face. \n\nA screeching sound echoed through the water, louder and higher than any human can make it. \n\nI swam.\n\nSomething grabbed me, but I swam. A sharp pain exploded in my feet, then in my legs. I looked down and saw blood. And something pink.\n\nJulia’s long fingernails were clawing at me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to reach down, tried to grab her hair and pull my best friend up with me, but she clawed at my hand. I pressed my bleeding fingers against my chest. The water muffled my cries.\n\nJulia looked me in the eyes. Her eyeballs looked like they were about to pop any second. She gasped for air where there was none, but still, her blue lips formed one word. I could read it as clear as day.\n\n*Stay.*\n\nSomehow, I shook her off and swam for my life.\n\nJulia’s screeching got quieter as I left her alone in the dark.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAir. Air! Oh my God I cannot describe how good it feels when it fills up your lungs. To take a deep breath, in and out, in and out. Nothing stopping you! Isn’t it amazing?\n\nI didn’t waste much time though. It took my all I had to get out of the water. I collapsed onto the shore, staring at the river I had walked by a thousand times.\n\nThe light Laurie had emitted was gone. The water was pitch-black.\n\n“Tim?”, I whispered, “Julia?”\n\nI knew exactly where she was. Her face was everything I could see when i closed my eyes. \n\nI summoned all my strength. “Julia?”, I yelled.\n\nI should have grabbed her harder. Wrap your arms under the victim’s armpits, take them up with you. I could have done it. I should have tried.\n\nMy voice sounded thin and lonely in the silence. \n\n“JULIA”, I repeated.\n\nNothing. The river floated peacefully through the night. All that was left was the quacking of a frog, and the factory lights, which reflected on the black, untouched water.\n\nI don’t really remember how I got home that night. My brain must have went in survival mode. The next thing I know is that I was at our street. Julia’s and my house were standing peacefully next to each other. Like they always had. Like we always did. I collapsed in front of the one with the blue roof, starring at the stupid “Only enter if you brought cookies” doormat Julia’s Mom had bought. \n\nIt must have been hours before the door opened. I felt like it were hours, hours in which I saw my best friend’s face in front of me, gasping for air when there was none.\n\nThen, there was commotion. Mr. Rosenthal’s frame. \n\n“Emma?”, he frowned, “why are you all alone at night? I... why are you in your underwear? And your legs\", he grabbed his chest, \"my God. Child have you... have you been...\"\n\n\"What? No\", I felt the tears running down my face, \"I haven't been *hurt* and I wasn't alone. I... I was with Julia. And… and other people. She is… she is…” I couldn’t finish the sentence. Mr. Rosenthal’s expression softened. “Hey, it’s alright. Just… Let’s get you home, okay? Don't cry. I’m sure your parents won’t be mad. You can take a shower, put on some clothes, and then we can all sit down and you can tell us about what happend with your friend.”\n\n*Your friend?*\n\nMy brain was a haze. The image of Julia’s face would not disappear.\n\n“What happened?”, my mom’s voice came through the fog. She helped us inside, and guided me to our sofa carefully. The sofa under the wall of pictures of me. Julia was in nearly every one of them.. I refused to look at them when I sat down. Julia. She was missing. I left her behind. I had to say it. I had to look her father in the eye and say it. I had to organize the search. But my mouth couldn’t form the words.\n\n“She just showed up at my doorstep like this”, Mr. Rosenthal tried to explained things to my Mom, “apparently, she was out with some girl named Julia…”\n\n“*Some girl*?”, I interrupted, “I’m talking about *our* Julia.”\n\nMy mom scoffed. “Honey, you know Mr. Rosenthal is fond of you, but not even I can remember all your school-friends, work-friends, drinking-friends, AND Dungeons-and-Dragons-friends. You gotta be more precise.”\n\nI stared at her. Something wasn’t right. Something was very, very wrong.\n\n“What does this Julia look like?”, my Dad had arrived in the living room, “where have we met her?”\n\nI ignored him. I stared straight at Mr. Rosenthal. \n\nHe had his daughter’s eyes.\n\n“*Your* Julia”, I whispered.\n\nHe just blinked. Suddenly, I felt like I was drowning again. But I would not go down without a fight. Mr. Rosenthal blinked another time. And I exploded.\n\n“My BEST FRIEND”, I screamed, “my *fucking* best friend, this annoying fuck, who insisted to go into the fucking river, because her fucking seawitch of a girlfriend wanted to”, I jumped up from the couch, which was not good for my head. \n\nI ignored it and pulled a picture from the wall, the one who showed little-me and little-Julia at the river. In it, we were hugging each other, the lights of the chemical company glooming in the background, watching over us like the stars. \n\n“Here, this charming young lady”, I practically slammed the picture in my mother’s face, “that idiot, she was such a fucking… fucking… she was…”\n\nI stopped. *Was*. My vision blurred. My hands shook so badly that I almost dropped our picture. No. She was alive. Julia was alive. We would find her.\n\nMy mom had taken a huge step back when I started screaming. She must have thought I was mad. But nevertheless, she came forward again, and tried to pull me into a hug. “You are in shock. You are hallucinating”, her voice trembled, “you are okay. You are okay, baby girl.”\n\n“I am *not* in shock”, I held up the picture like a crucifix and stepped away from her, “and Julia is not okay. And this other dude. They are… they are out there, and some blonde girl, Julia’s girlfriend, I… we have to get them, we have to get the police, and a team, and Mr. Rosenthal, she is your fucking daughter, your *only child*, I…”, I looked at him, but there was no recognition in his eyes, just confusion and… pain. \n\n“HOW CAN YOU JUST SIT THERE?”, I screamed.\n\nSuddenly, the room got very, very quiet.\n\n“Honey”, Mom whispered, “this is not funny. I know you propably are drunk or high, wherever you got that from, but Mr. Rosenthal is an old friend of our family. You know about”, she lowered her voice, “their *issues*. That is very tasteless of you...”\n\n“Wha… what issues?”, I stumbled. \n\n“The fertility issues”, father hissed, “you know they are… *unable*. I expect better, young lady.”\n\n“But… but Julia is *real*”, I insisted, “she is right on this picture, she… she…”\n\nI hesitated. Slowly, like I knew what was awaiting me, I turned around the photo.\n\nI was standing in front of the river. Smiling. Huge teeth-gap. Wearing the my favorite shorts with the ducks on them.\n\nAnd all alone.\n\nMy vision blurred. The picture burst onto the floor, seconds before I collapsed next to it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started to write at the hospital. I needed to. Document everything I knew. About Laurie. Her name had already been escaping me, but after staring at the disgustingly white hospital-walls for a while, I managed to pin it down. I think I even remembered the name of the boy. I could be mistaken, though. \n\nI stayed quiet. I didn’t scream again. I was scared that they would not let me out if I did. But I never stopped writing, and I never stopped crying. My tears tasted like the river I almost drowned in. I ignored them. I got out of the hospital. I contacted all of the various friends Julia made. Nobody remembered her. I went through all of our photo-albums, but I am alone in every single picture. The day she went to the dance with me when I had no partner was apparently spent with my Dad. I graduated by myself. The motorbike she spent so many hours on restoring has disappeared from the Rosenthal’s garage. Even their cat is gone. My room is emptier without her. Her decorations are missing. Her birthday-presents. All the stupid shit we made. My home is not my home anymore. My childhood is gone. Everything I was is gone. \n\nI am alone. \n\nBecause I left her to die.\n\nThe worst thing is that I am starting to forget. I know the names of the others because I wrote them down here, but they are not part of my memory anymore. Julia is still there. For now, I know she  existed… she exists. And I left her. The guilt is eating me alive, and there is no one to share it with, because people don’t even fucking believe that I’ve done something wrong. I left Julia down there to die, and now I’m about to let her be forgotten.\n\nThis is why I am writing this. I need someone to remember her. To remember us.\n\nThere is this city in Germany, Ludwigshafen. It is ugly, and therefore has become somewhat of a tourist attraction. If you are ever here, enjoy the stink. You can even visit the part of the suburbs where we grew up. Walk the places J walked, and think of her.\n\nBut don’t go for a swim.\n\nEven if there are no reports. \n\nI also heard you are some sort of experts on the paranormal, but I do not have much hope left. It wasn’t the government who made her disappear, we are not the USA, we cannot pull that off. Besides, J never hurt a soul. If it was something supernatural… idk. We are such a young town, we barely even have any folklore. \n\nMaybe it’s the chemical company. I always hated those fuckers. Maybe they did something to the water. Maybe Laurie worked for them. Maybe, they took my friend an this other person to experiment on them or some shit. But then, again, they produce mainly plastic. \n\nSo what the fuck am I supposed to do? \n\nUsually, whenever I had a problem, I would talk to J, I mean, that’s kind of what you do, run to your neighbor, who... Wait. Neighbor. She was something else. Wasn’t J…  J… J? What was her full name? No. No, no, no, it cannot be gone. It's in the text above, I know it is, but... but I just can't recall it. But I still remember her. I remember her face. I do. She looked like Mr. Rosenthal, but with a bigger… \n\nher hair was like… \n\nNo. \n\nStop.\n\nThere is only one thing I can do that might fix this. You guys figure the river out. I only know one thing for sure. \n\nBeing forgotten is not my worst fear anymore.\n\nAnd tonight, I will go for a swim.",

        "text": "*NOTE: Found this document in dad's computer on Monday, February 13th, 2023.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are spiders the size of newborn kittens in my basement. Some, I've been told, are much bigger. I found the first one last night under the influence, and the son of a bitch wasn't a friend.\n\nYes, meet me: David the Arachnophobe, one of those guys your friends like to prank with unrealistic plastic creepy-crawlies on Halloween to get an exaggerated reaction. It's no secret that I have always disliked these creatures, so finding out what has been living down there this whole time is more than I stomach. I'm a big man -not Dwayne Johnson big- but these circumstances have reduced me. I feel like a child trembling underneath the sheets again.\n\nGod help us, okay? I fear for my sanity, my life, but I fear for *yours*, too. It's why I'm here...Jesus, I guess that's why *you're* here, too, looking over these pages.\n\nThankfully, my soon-to-be-ex-wife and son weren't here during this unpleasant discovery. On Monday, Dee loaded a few hefty suitcases into the back of our Subaru and was getting into the car just as I was arriving home from work. My son was in the front seat, buckled in, and distracted by the addictive void of his phone when I confronted her in the car. The look she gave me, one I had grown to know well over the past eleven years of marriage, was etched so finely in her features that I could only stand back and watch as she backed out of the driveway.\n\nOur marriage is in its darkest days, but I don't care. I haven't called her back and I don't suppose it has even crossed my mind. I have spent *hours* worrying about the spiders in my basement, *hours* contemplating my next moves.\n\nAfter all that has happened today, I'm surprised I've managed to find the energy to crack this thing open and start typing. I suppose this will take a while if I'm to tell it right. My thought process is simple: If I continue to sit here against the wall in my living room facing the hallway, I'll be ready. I can't say I'll know what I'll do, but dammit, I'll *see* what's coming. And if they are concentrated in the area where the exterminator says they are, I'll have plenty of time to make a move. \n\nAnd by making a move, I mean getting the fuck out of *here*. \n\nI'm not a brilliant man, but I *know* that this vinegar-based repellent stuff won't repel their wrath. Will I have to use it? Christ, I hope not. \n\n\\*\n\nAs store manager of the local grocery store here in Newtonville, my work days are usually predictable. However, beginning yesterday, things became exceptionally hectic quickly, thanks to a computer glitch in our system. You wouldn’t immediately think about it, but having an efficient computer system makes every aspect of a retail workday move flawlessly toward divinity. Like a swollen throat, when it becomes painful, you can finally grasp the existential beauty of swallowing. \n\nEverything had been fine last month during the annual inspection. Nonetheless, some corroded wiring in the receiving area needed replacement. Our computers went down a few years ago due to a failed system upgrade. It took two weeks for IT to understand the problem and correct it. I lost two workers during that time; I feared losing more because of a negligent third party. I spent the day on the phone with corporate and assisting my demoralized employees. \n\nWhen I got home that evening, still fuming from the frustrations of work, the house was silent but accommodating. After a few mixed drinks, I began casually entertaining the idea of going downstairs. \n\nI’d been putting off my annual basement cleaning for months by then. I usually get to it during the end of March, but that was around when I began suspecting Dee of promiscuity. And when I got my mind set on something, I often forgot about the world around me. Usually, I became so crazy with certainty I could swear by it. Dee was only a partial piece of my simmering suspicions; That son of a bitch Upton was the border around it, and thinking about pushing him out of that ten-story- \n\nHell, you know the song. *Blah, blah*. Who cares, right? \n\nAnyway, I put some heavy metal on the stereo in the living room and felt pretty good about myself. It got Dee, Upton, and work out of my mind, as it usually does. \n\nWhen I opened the basement door, I sensed the alien air sigh as if I had disturbed some sleeping presence in the darkness. It was outright dank down there, the air alive, yeasty. I’ve always hated North Carolina summer nights, how they drag around their suffocating humidity like a long, black cape. \n\nTypically when I go down there, I clad myself in steel-toed boots and thick jeans. Last night, I made the mistake of going down in nothing but my boxer shorts. Silly David, I know. \n\nThoughts of scheming black creatures hiding in attic rafters settled on my mind once again, but I couldn’t let these apprehensions interfere with my need to come and go as I pleased.\n\nI flipped the light switch. The bulbs hummed into life as I went down. At the bottom, the concrete floor was cool, brimming with moisture from the earth, and the smell of age and mildew perforated the place. I moved my eyes to the ceiling, trying not to remind myself of that day in my youth.  \n\nThe utility lights obscured whatever perched above my head, so I gave myself a break and scanned the room. \n\nThe curio cabinets, taken from my grandmother's house after she died, were pressed against the far wall in the back. Stacked cardboard boxes, filled with trinkets and fragile collectibles, besieged the old work desk we had. Some of my wife’s childhood regalia piled high in more boxes, thrown aside for who knew. Other items cast away in the basement included a large plastic toy chest my son had grown out of, a few landscaping tools here and there, and a bunch of colored plastic moving containers filled with God knows what. \n\nThe overall goal for the basement was to incorporate a workstation and get one or two of those forty-inch Dewalt rolling cabinets for tools and miscellaneous storage. I realized that a lot would have to be thrown away or reorganized.\n\nI could make out a dense network of fine webs in the tight gap between the far left side wall and one of the curio cabinets.\n\n“Damn,” I muttered. \n\nMy son could help me whenever they got back. It would give the boy something to do besides stare into that damn screen all day. \n\nShadows moved in the corners, probably caused by the A/C blowing in from the top of the stairs, but I was still wary. The place seemed different, its dimensions off. The gin, no doubt, was tampering with my depth perception.\n\nSuddenly, a scuttling noise arose in the rubble next to me. \n\n*Mice*, I thought, as I stumbled for the broom leaning against the wall by the stairs. I would have to set a few mouse traps and put out some poison, too. By the time I finished my project, I would be a notorious serial killer of rodents. \n\nA few seconds later, a mouse zigzagged the stained floor. Cussing, I jumped to the side, using the broom to divert it away from my bare feet. It scampered towards a heap of boxes and out of sight.\n\n“Asshole,” I told its shadow. \n\nI began knocking mummified insects and webs off the lids of containers and moving them aside using the broom as an aid. Though now considerably impaired by the alcohol I had consumed earlier, I was careful not to step on anything that might make me yelp, such as a roach or another rodent. I worked my way forward, now and then peeking inside boxes when I got curious. I know I looked ridiculous, bent over half-naked, prodding at the mildewed objects, sweat gluing my boxers to the crack of my ass.\n\nI’m not convinced everything would have been fine if I had quit right then, put the broom back in its place, and stumbled back upstairs blissfully unaware of the monsters taking shelter in my home. I know that I shrieked hard enough to strain my throat when I pushed the next red container aside. \n\nBright red and white spots flared in my vision.\n\n“*Oh my God!*” I screamed.\n\nA bristly, light brown spider with a leg span larger than my entire outstretched hand sat before me. It reminded me of the pouncing face-hugger in the *Alien* movies, with its legs spread and flattened to the ground. To my horror, each leg was about the width of a carpenter's screw. Its body was plump and hairy. When the initial shock dissipated, I believed it was fake, a goddamn Halloween decoration or something. \n\nBut then its coarse body swelled as if it had read my mind and yearned to make itself known. A leg curled inward. Another leg tottered just above the floor. *Prod me with that thing, and I'll show you what I can do with my fangs*, it seemed to menace.\n\nIn my revulsion, I shouted and stepped back, the hair on the nape of my neck rising.  \n\nIt skittered, tangling itself underneath a nearby object. I fell backward, knocking a bucket of tools to the floor on the way down. Something heavy fell on my lower leg. I kicked at it urgently, caving in a bag of grass fertilizer. *Where is it? Where is that bastard spider?* I thought, my pulse a sledgehammer in my temple. The floor smelt of corrosion and rust, littered with dry mouse turds and the hardened corpses of small bugs. I leaned on my forearms for leverage, slid back a few feet, and started to hoist myself up. Something large was moving up the mountain of boxes at my feet. It climbed up to the top and disappeared on the other side.\n\nI shouted again, more incredulously than in fear. How did a spider that large find its way into my basement?\n\nOut of nowhere, the spider flew off the storage mountain. I groped blindly for the broom handle on the ground, grabbed it, and held it in a death grip. I was unable to take my eyes off of the spider. \n\nIt was a stagnant but swollen mass on the open floor. It sprang forward.\n\nI pushed the broom’s end into the spider’s path, intent on raking it across the floor until it was mush. It clung there despite my violent attempts at crushing it. It leaped for the threatening object with no hesitation, wrestling with the bristles in pursuit of what I can only describe as wholesome vengeance.\n\n“*Come* on, you son of a bitch!” I shouted, still shaking the broom. \n\nThe beast held the broom in a passionate embrace, legs coiled around the bristles. It folded, lurched, and dived. In an instant of wild calculation, I launched the broom like a torpedo into the rubble and made a hopping jolt for the stairs, sure it was already gaining on me and would tackle my ankle.\n\nI slipped, though, and slammed my face into a wooden plank. The unanticipated impact stunned me, but I risked a glance back.\n\nThe eight-legged monster was hauling ass in my direction with a speed I could not believe. \n\nHalf-crawling, half-sprinting, blood dripping from my nose, I clawed up the rest of the basement stairs, using my legs to slam the door shut hard. I dropped to the floor in the refreshing chill of the hallway, trembling, an aroma radiating off of me as thick as the darkness downstairs. There, I sat as I tried to catch my breath. \n\nThe basement door now appeared to be some portal to Hell, and I was frozen, unable to look away from the opening underneath. My body was sore from the escape, and I became aware that I was whimpering. I could fully see the spider in my mind's eye advancing up the stairs like a green beret stalking a retreating enemy. How its long legs curled over the gnarled wood, its bulging, alien body coming to rest, scouting danger with its complex, body-shrouding nervous system.\n\nSomething trailed down my face. On the verge of a manic shout, I patted it quickly and brought back a viscous red liquid on my fingers. I stared at the substance.\n\n“Did I get bit?” I said aloud. \n\nNervous laughter rose in my throat. I had been so horrified by the spider's impending assault that I had forgotten about bashing my head on the stairs only moments ago. Sometime later, I managed to walk to the kitchen and locate a roll of duct tape. Going back, I hurriedly sealed the slit underneath the door. Afterward, I went into the living room and fell onto the couch.\n\nThe following morning I woke up with crusty, coagulated blood on my face and saw the gash for the first time. It was worse than I thought. I decided to go to the emergency room to straighten it out before deciding what to do next about the spider.\n\nI called the local exterminator a little while later and told him I had a \"major spider problem.\" He began peppering me with a list of questions. When I told him it was only one spider -that I could see- and that it had attacked me in the basement, there was a pause at the other end. I wasn't surprised to hear a touch of humor in the man’s voice. \n\n\"One spider, eh?\"\n\n\"It's a nasty one,\" I said. I neglected to tell him how large it was in fear he'd break down and call me a nutcase. Indeed there were no spiders indigenous to Newtonville of that variety in my home. *Whoever comes will see for themselves*, I thought. After he had taken down all of my contact information, I hung up and continued applying duct tape over the air vents on the first floor.\n\nI was expecting a John Goodman portrayal of the heroic spider executioner like in the movie *Arachnophobia* \\-the only film that ever came close to being an actual horror movie, in my opinion. When the man stepped out of the white van with the *Bug Gone* company logo across the side a few hours later, he was considerably younger than I had imagined. He wore navy blue coveralls and had a five-o-clock shadow. His widow’s peak was already dripping. I met him in the driveway out in the baking July sun.\n\nWe made small talk while he rounded up supplies from the van's interior: a pair of elbow-length gloves, goggles, a respirator, and a red tank with a two-strap harness that he slung over his shoulders like a jet-pack. A hose was attached to the tank and the other end to a long dispenser that he clipped to his belt. I invited him in and watched his face while he observed what I had done to my living room over the past few hours.\n\n\"Okay,\" he said, bypassing the fifty-inch plasma TV I unscrewed from the wall earlier and had left in the middle of the floor. \"Thought you said he was in the basement? Did he get out?”\n\n\"The fucker’s still in the basement,\" I said.\n\nHe nodded as he surveyed the living room, and I think he knew I had taken the fast train to La-La Land then. *That’s okay,* I thought. *You won’t* *seem so critical of my actions soon.*  \n\nIn addition, I had flipped both couches on their sides and removed all the cushions; I stacked them outside behind the porch to burn for later on. The glass table in the living room wasn't problematic, but I needed to disassemble it to get at the rug underneath. I had rolled it into a loose roll and struggled with it across the yard. All furniture tucked up against the wall was brought forward and laid on its sides. I emptied all kitchen drawers, the contents from each worth saving I put in garbage bags, tied in triple knots, and set in the garage; the drawers themselves were put in the pile outside with the cushions and would be burned, too. I took down any framed pictures on the walls. And with the air vents sealed, I hardly felt any better.\n\n\"Uh-huh. Where's the basement, man?\"\n\nI led him down the hall to a door I had sealed completely with blue tape. He turned to me, smirking. \"How am I supposed to get down there?\" \n\nI went to grab the box cutter from the kitchen. A sheen of clammy sweat started to ooze from the pores on my forehead.\n\n\"Does that stuff do the job?\" I said, pointing to his tank of poison, the razor unsteady against the sealed crease in the door. \"No games. That stuff will do more than stun it, right? I want it to die...Okay?\"\n\n\"I got the shit for the circus, man.\" He patiently stepped aside and then watched as I cut the seal along the entire perimeter of the door. My heart was drumming.\n\n*It's right there behind the door, waiting to pounce. I know it is. It's going to be right there, BEHIND THE DOOR! OH, GOD! SOMEHOW IT KNOWS WHAT I’M DOING*\\-\n\n\"Hey, man.\"\n\nI looked up at the exterminator, light-headed from bending over. He was gripping the doorknob. How long had I been staring at the crack underneath the door?\n\n\"Relax. I'll find him. Your spider might be nasty, but once he gets a strong whiff of this...\" He cocked a thumb towards the tank on his back. \"...he'll be in spider heaven in two minutes. And if there's more, well, they say if you love your job, you won't have to work a day in your life.\"\n\nHis southern drawl forced a grin out of me, and in my throbbing panic, I almost thanked him for it. My palms were slimy with thick ooze, and I nodded rather than risk him hearing the terror in my words.\n\nHe opened the door, looked back to wink, and slowly began his descent. I expected a sizeable hairy creature to catapult through the air onto his chest at any moment, so I shrank away like a puppy who wants no part in meeting the big family dog. If there were more than one of those things, I didn’t know *what* I would do.  \n\n*Just find and kill the fucking thing,* I thought*. Get it over with. And kill anything else that moves, too. Hell, coat the whole house with poison! I don’t care!*\n\nI quickly shut the door. After a few seconds of heavy foot-falls, there came a distressing BANG. It sounded like he had overstepped and crashed to the bottom. Intermittent curses and harsh grunts drifted upwards. I listened at the door, touching the knob, and then expelled the breath I had been holding when his hasty, slightly amused voice resounded from below:\n\n\"Alright! Busted my ass, but I'll survive!\"\n\nI thought I heard the echo of a laugh, so I relaxed and went into the kitchen to make myself a sandwich. Spider-proofing the first floor of my house had made me ravenous. As I reached for a beer in the refrigerator to wash it down, I heard a bark of surprise from the basement and knocked the beer bottle over onto the floor. It shattered. I rushed down the hallway and pressed an ear against the door.\n\n\"Holy shit!\" he said. The sandwich suddenly felt like a piece of granite in my stomach. He was moving all over the place, hurriedly knocking boxes and containers away to pursue the spider. *Dear, God*, I thought. *The thing will get away. He'll lose sight of it. And then-*  \n\n\"Get back here! I ain't done with you!\" Something made of metal crashed to the floor. The exterminator's voice was full of crazed energy. \"Oh, you *are* an ugly thing! Shit!\"\n\nHe sounded like a madman angrily trying to locate his chemistry goggles. I heard his next words loud and clear with my ear planted firmly against the door. \n\n\"Well, well! Look at your friend! Let's see how he likes this!\"\n\n*Yeah! Cut him down, George! Beat Thomas the Big Boy to a pulp!* I thought crazily, ungluing my ear from the door.  \n\nAn enormous wave of fright overcame me, wrapping me in a mysterious cocoon of pure, spontaneous clarity. It was as if I had been hoisted into a pair of roller skates and pushed. I levitated towards the keys on the kitchen counter and flew through the front door. I landed on one knee on the hot concrete sidewalk. The spout of pain could have been as meniscal as a pinprick because I was still sprinting through the fresh-cut grass, both in body and mind. My breathing didn't matter, just the distance I covered.\n\nThe temperature inside the truck was a notch above sweltering, and I became alarmed when I could not get my fingers to stop shaking long enough to turn the ignition over. \n\n“Thomas the Big Boy Spider ‘gone git you!” I shouted, unaware I was giggling like a lunatic.  \n\nI counted to five and then inserted the key into the ignition again. The truck rumbled to life. I was dripping with sweat, skull throbbing, by the time the hot air turned cool. \n\n*Gonna leave a stranger in your house, David?*\n\n“Roger that.” \n\nI drove into town and turned into the McDonald’s. I got a sweet tea and parked, turning up the radio. The station was playing classic Jackson Browne and Neil Diamond. Although I was aware of the music on the stereo, I could hear the regular lub-dub of blood in my temples. As I started to turn the knob to another station, I noticed a discarded straw wrapper in between the cup holder and passenger seat. Right as I began reaching for it, my hand froze on the passenger seat cushion. I was suddenly so sure -*positive*\\- that there was a set of eight eyes watching me from the back. The door handle seemed a mile away. \n\nI lifted my gaze to the rear-view mirror, expecting to see eight legs reaching over the seat, but saw nothing. Resurgent terror constricted my windpipe. Instead, I yanked the door open and spewed my lunch onto the steaming pavement.\n\nThe exterminator was smoking a cigarette on the steps when I got back twenty minutes later. He watched me pull up the driveway and tipped me a wave. When I got out, I saw that he was heavily perspiring. Rivulets of sweat streamed down his red face. His coveralls were drenched inside and out, the poison tank leaning against one of the porch posts. He exhaled a mouthful of smoke. \n\n\"I sprayed the whole exterior of the house while you were away. I figured you wouldn’t mind,” he told me. \n\n\"Thank you,\" I croaked.\n\nHe looked at me steadily. \n\n“You okay, man?”\n\nI had to urinate badly, but the thought of going back into the house made me shiver.\n\n“No, not at fucking all,” I said. \n\nThe exterminator grinned, putting the butt out on the step and holding it with his thumb and index fingers.\n\n“If there is a Heaven and a Hell, Satan put those things on this earth for his amusement. The ugly fuckers exist for no other reason than to terrorize us.” He laughed, but it was uneasy. He stood up and went to the front door, beckoning me to follow. \"They’re aggressive, man, and don’t like me much.\"\n\nIt had been a chore entering that house again, but going to relieve myself in the bathroom was utterly unthinkable. \n\nI could tell my tape work on the air vents annoyed the exterminator because he looked at the one in the living room and shook his head.  \n\nAs if on cue, he said:\n\n“Mind if I get something out of the refrigerator, man? Throat is a little dry.”\n\nIt was more than that, though. The man was overheated and probably dizzy as hell. I felt bad. He came back with a beer and popped the cap off easily with his thick palms.    \n\n\"I originally thought they were huge wolf spiders,” he began, chugging half the bottle. “But their legs are different, hell, their behavior is different. I may just be the local guy somebody calls out to their house for the routine spraying, but I’ve always been the spider guy to my coworkers. I don't have a degree in the field, but I spend a lot of my free time researching them. I think what you have in the basement are Huntsman spiders. They are scarce around here. Over the past couple of decades, they've been slowly introduced into the lower southern parts of the U.S, but I never thought I'd see one this far north. They're indigenous to Australia, parts of Africa, and Asia. The farthest place north that I've ever heard of them being in is the Panhandle. They can be found in parts of Texas, too.\" He leaned against the wall nearest the kitchen, a hand gripping his heavy-duty belt, waiting for me to say something. When I didn't, he continued:\n\n\"They aren't that mean unless you come across a babe. The queens -my word, by the way- are always bat-shit and hostile. She'll stand guard around her spider nest and not eat for weeks sometimes. If you leave them alone, they tend to be fine. All they want to do is eat the bugs down there. They're nomadic, spending their time hunting and eating.” He took another long swallow. “But I think you've got a pretty pissed-off crew down there. They didn't take too lightly to me storming in and spraying them with my napalm. And- \n\nMy heart hammered. *Crew*. The word turned my blood into sloshing ice shavings.\n\n\"And what? How many were down there?\"\n\n“I’m intrigued. I thought it was just a straggler at first. I counted maybe five, but there's probably -most likely- more. You have a nasty infestation, man. The other thing, well, shit. Now I don’t want to tell you, but...Aw, *hell*, man. There’s one the size of a dinner plate down there.”\n\nHe recoiled from whatever he saw on my face. \n\n\"*Five? A goddamn dinner plate!*\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"You see, when I saw *that* gal, I nearly shit my pants.” He went on without pause, setting the empty beer bottle on the floor. “Also, when you see a bunch of them together like that, it usually means there's a spider nest somewhere near. A female Huntsman put a nest in your basement, and I’ll bet you a brand new suit that the huge one is our pissy little girl. That's what I think, and how wicked rude of her! I mean, really,” he said, shaking his head, probably in commiseration. \n\n*A fucking dinner plate,* I thought despairingly. *Happy Thanksgiving!*\n\nWords fell out of my mouth like verbal diarrhea.\n\n\"Motherfucker!\" I shouted. \"Are they poisonous? How many did you kill? Did you crush *it*?\" By “*it,*” I meant one spider in particular, but I didn’t have to elaborate any further.\n\nHe grinned, but it was strained.\n\n\"Their fangs *are* large enough to break through the skin, but their venom is not potent enough to cause harm. And, no, man, she got away. Pretty fast...” He turned and seemed to inspect the nearest wall. “Their bodies deflate like punctured tires when they die. Rest assured, a few got their medicine.”\n\nI couldn't believe what I was hearing. An exotic species of super spider had put a *shop* in my basement? I pointed crazily at the floor in the general direction of my despair.\n\n\"That's a big problem...\" I realized I had forgotten to ask his name earlier. “*What’s your name?*” \n\n\"AJ.\"\n\n\"AJ, that’s a big fucking problem!\"\n\nHe was nodding, but I figured he’d heard similar mantras in his loathsome profession over the years. \n\n\"I didn’t see any openings or cracks in the foundation when I walked the perimeter. I’m not even positive about *how* they got in. I sprayed for you nonetheless.”\n\nI wiped the bead of sweat making its way down the ridge of my nose.\n\n“Christ, what a shit show,” I said, more to myself. “I should just burn the whole damn thing down. *That’ll* be my annual basement cleansing.\"\n\nHe went on as if he hadn’t heard me.\n\n\"You can make a water-vinegar-based repellent if one gets too close for comfort.\" His voice wavered as he most likely recalled the *gal* down there. \"Spider infestations are tricky. Other pests tend to be a little easier to kill, but spiders…,” he trailed off. When he finished his thought, I stared at him incredulously and surprised myself with a chuckle. “Spiders are the dicks of the bug kingdom. It isn’t fool-proof, but I’d like to throw a bomb down there.”\n\n“A bomb?” I said. \n\nAJ laughed. \n\n“No, man. A bug bomb. Not a real one.” \n\nAJ called a helper named Rob, who looked younger than AJ when he arrived. Together they went in and set up the bug bomb while I remained outside. When they came back out not too long later, Rob was jittery and wild-eyed. He went directly to the van and got in. Seconds later, he left tire marks on the blacktop as he sped away.\n\n“Thought I was lying. Now he’s gonna quit,” AJ said. \n\nI turned to him. Despite the oppressive afternoon heat, he surveyed the speeding van, hands stuffed in his pockets.\n\n“*What?* Why?”\n\n“You know kids, man. Said *he* would judge how big the fuckers were, I guess to prove he had balls. He almost butted heads with it on the rafters. Came within inches of a nasty surprise. He’s shaken up.”\n\nI looked back at the house. *Let’s hope it works,* I remember thinking. *This has got to work. Christ, this has got to work.*\n\nEvidently, I had spoken aloud, and now AJ followed my upward gaze.\n\n“I’m optimistic,” he said. We stood in silence for a moment.\n\n“Even if the bomb doesn’t work, man-\n\n“*Christ*, it better!”\n\n\"You can always burn the house down and use the insurance money to move someplace else.” \n\nHe winked. I stared at him, then winked back. In a few seconds, we were both laughing. I was not laughing as I watched him back out of the driveway.\n\n\\*\n\nIt's been four days since the bomb went off in my basement and three days since I overheard what Gray said in the grocery store. I thought I was getting better until then. I really did.\n\nA regular at my store, old man Gray was the good-natured type who always came in with that old-fashioned smile and pockets full of rattling loose change. He always came in alone, a lonely widower, and got out not because he had to but because he wanted to. I know it sounds silly, but there was a vibrant aura about him. The staff adored him, and although he'd somehow always manage to stop me mid-task on the floor, I never thought to utter a sharp or otherwise impatient word with him. This Monday afternoon, I was directing duties to my employees and taking care of some of my own when he came in. \n\nThe older man resembled a frightened skeleton; his eyes were more prominent, bulging in their wrinkled sockets. He shuffled up to one of my cashiers and said:\n\n\"Young lady, I'd appreciate it if you could make an old man feel better. It's rotten to come in here and ask, but...\" I crept forward, partially hidden in one of the aisles. He was fumbling in his pockets as if trying to find a few extra cents for a candy bar.\n\n\"Help *me*,\" he continued, his voice shaking now. \"Can you do that, young lady?\"\n\nMy cashier appeared uncomfortable, but she kept her tone steady and leaned forward.\n\n\"What's wrong, Mr.Gray? How can I help you, sir?\"\n\nOld man Gray leaned over the register, and for a second, I thought he was falling asleep right there. \n\n\"Oh, dear. I've gotten into such a fright. Forgive me, but I've never seen one so god awful *big*. Help me. Please. *Help*.\" I could hear the terror in his raspy voice. It was fine-tuned and unmistakable, and I knew what it was then.\n\n\"I left my house for the drug store this morning and came back...Lord, what I *saw*. I got back in my car and left again and came back later. It hasn't moved in hours as if it knows...*it knows!\"*\n\nMy cashier flicked her eyes in my direction, and I stepped out of the aisle. She was saying: \n\n\"I don't understand-\n\nOld man Gray threw his head to the ceiling and howled.\n\n\"*All those eyes! Watching me! It's on my front door, and I can't get near it! Please, somebody help! Please, please, please!\"*\n\nThat evening, after work, I pulled up into my driveway and sat behind the wheel, staring at the eerie dark of the front porch. I remembered the hair-raising words from Gray: *All those eyes! Watching me!*\n\nSince bombing my basement, I’ve been researching the Huntsman spider. All of this has done very little to absolve my fears. I learned that they are nocturnal creatures, carrying out meticulous and ruthless attacks on unsuspecting prey at night. Basically, they will eat whatever succumbs to them. Moreover, I learned that they often wander into homes and vehicles in Australia. Motherfucking perfect.\n\nI’ve learned AJ *does* know what he is talking about.\n\nStill sitting in my truck, staring at my front door, I thought of AJ’s words: *Their fangs are large enough to break through the skin, but their venom is not potent enough to cause harm...* \n\nSleeping in the truck isn’t an option; it’s too hot. I’ll have to force myself to sleep in the living room tonight.\n\n\\*\n\nIt's July 30th, 2022. This morning, Dee came and saw what I had done to the house. I tried explaining to her that we have a spider infestation in the basement. She wouldn’t listen. When she saw that I had placed all of her belongings -including most of her clothes and jewelry- in multiple garbage bags and set them in the garage, she left in a rage of squealing tires. I don’t have time to worry about it, though, because I think the Huntsmen are in the attic now.\n\nAnd trust me, that is enough worry for me. \n\n\\*\n\nIt's August 1st, and I’ve started a large bonfire in the backyard. So far, I have burned most of the furniture in the house. The fire at its highest intensity was nearly as high as the first floor. If I’m being honest, this brought me comfort, but now I am exhausted. The neighbors are worried about me. They told me they called the fire department, but they have not shown up yet.\n\nI’m wondering what’s taking them so long.  \n\nBy nightfall, the fire was more of a small campfire. Dead tired and drenched, I watched the bright red and orange embers in the coals swell in and out like a torched heart. Tomorrow, if the fire department does not dissuade me, I might get back at it.\n\n\\*\n\nAugust 6th. I don't think AJ’s bomb worked. I have not ventured down into the basement; I have only put my ear to the door. My house is empty. The bottom floor looks like a white room with a hardwood floor. The master bedroom upstairs is cleaned out save for the bare mattress plopped on the carpet in the middle of the room. Not that I have slept on it. I am too scared to sleep, and I dream of large webs when I do. I sealed both sinks with whole rolls of duct tape and did the same to the shower and bathtub drains in case something was in the pipes. I haven't showered. I haven’t brushed my teeth. I think I am losing it, but then and again, I swear I think they are watching me. \n\nAccording to the local paper, last Sunday, the 2nd of August, a man stumbled into an emergency room holding his hand in a fit of agony. *The Newtonville Star* described the incident as an \"infrequent but scary occurrence.\" The victim was interviewed a day later in his hospital bed. Quote: \"It was the biggest spider I ever saw. It leaped onto my hand in my attempt to trap it,\" he told the reporter. \"I guess that's what I get for trying to dispose of it the humane way (laughter). The terrifying part was how hard it was to get off. It scared my wife and me to death.\" He was expected to recover quickly.\n\nTwo days later, on the 4th of August, there was a nasty four-car pile-up on Hwy 70 East leaving Newtonville at around two in the afternoon. A child was killed and five people injured when a red minivan suddenly swerved sharply towards the right shoulder and then turned and crisscrossed three lanes of traffic. One bystander described the scene as \"almost apocalyptic.\" Another bystander provided insight into the terrible accident. The local news station reported on his testimony. Quote: \"I was in the middle lane when it happened. The car was on my right side, and when I looked that way, the woman behind the wheel was flailing around like she was locked in there with a wild animal or something.” That woman received a few deep lacerations and a broken arm, they said. Still, she was \"hysterical\" and \"extremely physical\" when paramedics tried to get her on the stretcher.\n\nLater that day, a black Chevy Cruz rolled down Main Street in Newtonville with the front door wide open. Nobody was in the car, but a few witnesses on the street sidewalk said they saw a frantic man in a white T-shirt jump out minutes before.\n\nA few days ago, I stopped driving the Chevy, not because there was one of them in it, but because there could have been. And let me tell you, somehow, that's worse than finding one on the floorboard or looking into the rear-view mirror to see one spread out over the rear glass window. When you fear what lurks in unfathomable places, there is a persistent terror in every particle that grazes your skin, every step you take outside your domain, and every position you try to sleep in. This is what it has become for me.\n\nI power-washed my old Harley thoroughly for over an hour today and did the same thing with the helmet. It's amazing how many objects we take for granted are safe when there could likely be a creature hidden along its depths or nestled in a gap intent on striking. *I know that bike is clean*, I'd tell myself. *I know there's nothing in that helmet*. But when I blink, is it possible that something changed, something moved in that tiny fraction of a second?\n\n\\*\n\nIt’s August 7th. Last night I decided I couldn't sleep another night here. I became obsessed with the idea that they were moving inside the walls. With only the week-long clothes on my back, I took the Harley-Davidson northward and stopped in Wilson, a large rural community on the verge of becoming a small city. I booked a few nights at a Super 8 and requested a room on the first floor, just in case I needed to get out of the building in a hurry. \n\nThose bedside lamp-light domes were weak, and I thought I saw a Huntsman perched underneath the air-conditioning unit at the window, shrouded in shadow amid the sickly glow. It was nothing but my ill imagination. Surprise, surprise.\n\nStill...I find myself looking back now and again as I write. *Is* it my imagination?\n\nAfter doing a thorough but cautious search of the bathroom, I took a long shower. As I wiped the condensation from the mirror, a haggard man reflected back on me. I almost didn’t recognize his naked eyes. \n\nI stripped the comforter and sheets off the bed and made sure the room was clear of anything that moved in plain sight. In doing this, I realized I had forgotten my Mac back in Newtonville. I begrudgingly retrieved it, reminding myself not to forget anything else. \n\nBefore I left again, I began thinking about that big pile of estranged wood that was once my home. The culmination of these thoughts landed me in a fit of rage that I fear I cannot put into words. Maybe it was what I perceived as hundreds of tiny insect-like eyes staring out at me from the tree line, mocking me. Any home that shelters such evil doesn't deserve to be a home for anything. It drew those Huntsman spiders in, and if I couldn't live there contently, *they* couldn't fucking live there.\n\nI got a call from Dee very early this morning. She had awoken me from a fevered sleep, screaming and sobbing at the same time that our house had gone up in flames.\n\n“*There's nothing left! It's all gone, David!*”\n\n*Tell it to Upton, you fucking whore,* I thought. It was delightful. It was more than pleasing.  \n\nIt made me laugh, and I knew she could pick it up the many miles in between us. When she had calmed down after a minute or so, I said:\n\n\"At least David doesn’t have a spider problem anymore. I’m sure Upton has a room in that big house of his for all of your precious shit, Denise.\" She was saying something else, but I didn’t get a word of it. I ended the call. \n\nI know better than to settle in, despite the room appearing safe. I may be traveling a lot. Who knows how far north these spiders will travel, carried further and further by some dumb insect-like intuition we humans cannot understand? Who's to say there isn't one underneath the box spring waiting for me to go to bed? Or one behind that cushioned chair in the corner? And worst of all, who's to say that there isn't one currently creeping closer and closer to my feet?\n\nI know one fucking thing, my friends. Fire seems to take some of the edge off, and there are a lot of potential Huntsman infestations in Newtonville and beyond.",

        "text": "*NOTE: Found this document in dad's computer on Monday, February 13th, 2023.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are spiders the size of newborn kittens in my basement. Some, I've been told, are much bigger. I found the first one last night under the influence, and the son of a bitch wasn't a friend.\n\nYes, meet me: David the Arachnophobe, one of those guys your friends like to prank with unrealistic plastic creepy-crawlies on Halloween to get an exaggerated reaction. It's no secret that I have always disliked these creatures, so finding out what has been living down there this whole time is more than I stomach. I'm a big man -not Dwayne Johnson big- but these circumstances have reduced me. I feel like a child trembling underneath the sheets again.\n\nGod help us, okay? I fear for my sanity, my life, but I fear for *yours*, too. It's why I'm here...Jesus, I guess that's why *you're* here, too, looking over these pages.\n\nThankfully, my soon-to-be-ex-wife and son weren't here during this unpleasant discovery. On Monday, Dee loaded a few hefty suitcases into the back of our Subaru and was getting into the car just as I was arriving home from work. My son was in the front seat, buckled in, and distracted by the addictive void of his phone when I confronted her in the car. The look she gave me, one I had grown to know well over the past eleven years of marriage, was etched so finely in her features that I could only stand back and watch as she backed out of the driveway.\n\nOur marriage is in its darkest days, but I don't care. I haven't called her back and I don't suppose it has even crossed my mind. I have spent *hours* worrying about the spiders in my basement, *hours* contemplating my next moves.\n\nAfter all that has happened today, I'm surprised I've managed to find the energy to crack this thing open and start typing. I suppose this will take a while if I'm to tell it right. My thought process is simple: If I continue to sit here against the wall in my living room facing the hallway, I'll be ready. I can't say I'll know what I'll do, but dammit, I'll *see* what's coming. And if they are concentrated in the area where the exterminator says they are, I'll have plenty of time to make a move. \n\nAnd by making a move, I mean getting the fuck out of *here*. \n\nI'm not a brilliant man, but I *know* that this vinegar-based repellent stuff won't repel their wrath. Will I have to use it? Christ, I hope not. \n\n\\*\n\nAs store manager of the local grocery store here in Newtonville, my work days are usually predictable. However, beginning yesterday, things became exceptionally hectic quickly, thanks to a computer glitch in our system. You wouldn’t immediately think about it, but having an efficient computer system makes every aspect of a retail workday move flawlessly toward divinity. Like a swollen throat, when it becomes painful, you can finally grasp the existential beauty of swallowing. \n\nEverything had been fine last month during the annual inspection. Nonetheless, some corroded wiring in the receiving area needed replacement. Our computers went down a few years ago due to a failed system upgrade. It took two weeks for IT to understand the problem and correct it. I lost two workers during that time; I feared losing more because of a negligent third party. I spent the day on the phone with corporate and assisting my demoralized employees. \n\nWhen I got home that evening, still fuming from the frustrations of work, the house was silent but accommodating. After a few mixed drinks, I began casually entertaining the idea of going downstairs. \n\nI’d been putting off my annual basement cleaning for months by then. I usually get to it during the end of March, but that was around when I began suspecting Dee of promiscuity. And when I got my mind set on something, I often forgot about the world around me. Usually, I became so crazy with certainty I could swear by it. Dee was only a partial piece of my simmering suspicions; That son of a bitch Upton was the border around it, and thinking about pushing him out of that ten-story- \n\nHell, you know the song. *Blah, blah*. Who cares, right? \n\nAnyway, I put some heavy metal on the stereo in the living room and felt pretty good about myself. It got Dee, Upton, and work out of my mind, as it usually does. \n\nWhen I opened the basement door, I sensed the alien air sigh as if I had disturbed some sleeping presence in the darkness. It was outright dank down there, the air alive, yeasty. I’ve always hated North Carolina summer nights, how they drag around their suffocating humidity like a long, black cape. \n\nTypically when I go down there, I clad myself in steel-toed boots and thick jeans. Last night, I made the mistake of going down in nothing but my boxer shorts. Silly David, I know. \n\nThoughts of scheming black creatures hiding in attic rafters settled on my mind once again, but I couldn’t let these apprehensions interfere with my need to come and go as I pleased.\n\nI flipped the light switch. The bulbs hummed into life as I went down. At the bottom, the concrete floor was cool, brimming with moisture from the earth, and the smell of age and mildew perforated the place. I moved my eyes to the ceiling, trying not to remind myself of that day in my youth.  \n\nThe utility lights obscured whatever perched above my head, so I gave myself a break and scanned the room. \n\nThe curio cabinets, taken from my grandmother's house after she died, were pressed against the far wall in the back. Stacked cardboard boxes, filled with trinkets and fragile collectibles, besieged the old work desk we had. Some of my wife’s childhood regalia piled high in more boxes, thrown aside for who knew. Other items cast away in the basement included a large plastic toy chest my son had grown out of, a few landscaping tools here and there, and a bunch of colored plastic moving containers filled with God knows what. \n\nThe overall goal for the basement was to incorporate a workstation and get one or two of those forty-inch Dewalt rolling cabinets for tools and miscellaneous storage. I realized that a lot would have to be thrown away or reorganized.\n\nI could make out a dense network of fine webs in the tight gap between the far left side wall and one of the curio cabinets.\n\n“Damn,” I muttered. \n\nMy son could help me whenever they got back. It would give the boy something to do besides stare into that damn screen all day. \n\nShadows moved in the corners, probably caused by the A/C blowing in from the top of the stairs, but I was still wary. The place seemed different, its dimensions off. The gin, no doubt, was tampering with my depth perception.\n\nSuddenly, a scuttling noise arose in the rubble next to me. \n\n*Mice*, I thought, as I stumbled for the broom leaning against the wall by the stairs. I would have to set a few mouse traps and put out some poison, too. By the time I finished my project, I would be a notorious serial killer of rodents. \n\nA few seconds later, a mouse zigzagged the stained floor. Cussing, I jumped to the side, using the broom to divert it away from my bare feet. It scampered towards a heap of boxes and out of sight.\n\n“Asshole,” I told its shadow. \n\nI began knocking mummified insects and webs off the lids of containers and moving them aside using the broom as an aid. Though now considerably impaired by the alcohol I had consumed earlier, I was careful not to step on anything that might make me yelp, such as a roach or another rodent. I worked my way forward, now and then peeking inside boxes when I got curious. I know I looked ridiculous, bent over half-naked, prodding at the mildewed objects, sweat gluing my boxers to the crack of my ass.\n\nI’m not convinced everything would have been fine if I had quit right then, put the broom back in its place, and stumbled back upstairs blissfully unaware of the monsters taking shelter in my home. I know that I shrieked hard enough to strain my throat when I pushed the next red container aside. \n\nBright red and white spots flared in my vision.\n\n“*Oh my God!*” I screamed.\n\nA bristly, light brown spider with a leg span larger than my entire outstretched hand sat before me. It reminded me of the pouncing face-hugger in the *Alien* movies, with its legs spread and flattened to the ground. To my horror, each leg was about the width of a carpenter's screw. Its body was plump and hairy. When the initial shock dissipated, I believed it was fake, a goddamn Halloween decoration or something. \n\nBut then its coarse body swelled as if it had read my mind and yearned to make itself known. A leg curled inward. Another leg tottered just above the floor. *Prod me with that thing, and I'll show you what I can do with my fangs*, it seemed to menace.\n\nIn my revulsion, I shouted and stepped back, the hair on the nape of my neck rising.  \n\nIt skittered, tangling itself underneath a nearby object. I fell backward, knocking a bucket of tools to the floor on the way down. Something heavy fell on my lower leg. I kicked at it urgently, caving in a bag of grass fertilizer. *Where is it? Where is that bastard spider?* I thought, my pulse a sledgehammer in my temple. The floor smelt of corrosion and rust, littered with dry mouse turds and the hardened corpses of small bugs. I leaned on my forearms for leverage, slid back a few feet, and started to hoist myself up. Something large was moving up the mountain of boxes at my feet. It climbed up to the top and disappeared on the other side.\n\nI shouted again, more incredulously than in fear. How did a spider that large find its way into my basement?\n\nOut of nowhere, the spider flew off the storage mountain. I groped blindly for the broom handle on the ground, grabbed it, and held it in a death grip. I was unable to take my eyes off of the spider. \n\nIt was a stagnant but swollen mass on the open floor. It sprang forward.\n\nI pushed the broom’s end into the spider’s path, intent on raking it across the floor until it was mush. It clung there despite my violent attempts at crushing it. It leaped for the threatening object with no hesitation, wrestling with the bristles in pursuit of what I can only describe as wholesome vengeance.\n\n“*Come* on, you son of a bitch!” I shouted, still shaking the broom. \n\nThe beast held the broom in a passionate embrace, legs coiled around the bristles. It folded, lurched, and dived. In an instant of wild calculation, I launched the broom like a torpedo into the rubble and made a hopping jolt for the stairs, sure it was already gaining on me and would tackle my ankle.\n\nI slipped, though, and slammed my face into a wooden plank. The unanticipated impact stunned me, but I risked a glance back.\n\nThe eight-legged monster was hauling ass in my direction with a speed I could not believe. \n\nHalf-crawling, half-sprinting, blood dripping from my nose, I clawed up the rest of the basement stairs, using my legs to slam the door shut hard. I dropped to the floor in the refreshing chill of the hallway, trembling, an aroma radiating off of me as thick as the darkness downstairs. There, I sat as I tried to catch my breath. \n\nThe basement door now appeared to be some portal to Hell, and I was frozen, unable to look away from the opening underneath. My body was sore from the escape, and I became aware that I was whimpering. I could fully see the spider in my mind's eye advancing up the stairs like a green beret stalking a retreating enemy. How its long legs curled over the gnarled wood, its bulging, alien body coming to rest, scouting danger with its complex, body-shrouding nervous system.\n\nSomething trailed down my face. On the verge of a manic shout, I patted it quickly and brought back a viscous red liquid on my fingers. I stared at the substance.\n\n“Did I get bit?” I said aloud. \n\nNervous laughter rose in my throat. I had been so horrified by the spider's impending assault that I had forgotten about bashing my head on the stairs only moments ago. Sometime later, I managed to walk to the kitchen and locate a roll of duct tape. Going back, I hurriedly sealed the slit underneath the door. Afterward, I went into the living room and fell onto the couch.\n\nThe following morning I woke up with crusty, coagulated blood on my face and saw the gash for the first time. It was worse than I thought. I decided to go to the emergency room to straighten it out before deciding what to do next about the spider.\n\nI called the local exterminator a little while later and told him I had a \"major spider problem.\" He began peppering me with a list of questions. When I told him it was only one spider -that I could see- and that it had attacked me in the basement, there was a pause at the other end. I wasn't surprised to hear a touch of humor in the man’s voice. \n\n\"One spider, eh?\"\n\n\"It's a nasty one,\" I said. I neglected to tell him how large it was in fear he'd break down and call me a nutcase. Indeed there were no spiders indigenous to Newtonville of that variety in my home. *Whoever comes will see for themselves*, I thought. After he had taken down all of my contact information, I hung up and continued applying duct tape over the air vents on the first floor.\n\nI was expecting a John Goodman portrayal of the heroic spider executioner like in the movie *Arachnophobia* \\-the only film that ever came close to being an actual horror movie, in my opinion. When the man stepped out of the white van with the *Bug Gone* company logo across the side a few hours later, he was considerably younger than I had imagined. He wore navy blue coveralls and had a five-o-clock shadow. His widow’s peak was already dripping. I met him in the driveway out in the baking July sun.\n\nWe made small talk while he rounded up supplies from the van's interior: a pair of elbow-length gloves, goggles, a respirator, and a red tank with a two-strap harness that he slung over his shoulders like a jet-pack. A hose was attached to the tank and the other end to a long dispenser that he clipped to his belt. I invited him in and watched his face while he observed what I had done to my living room over the past few hours.\n\n\"Okay,\" he said, bypassing the fifty-inch plasma TV I unscrewed from the wall earlier and had left in the middle of the floor. \"Thought you said he was in the basement? Did he get out?”\n\n\"The fucker’s still in the basement,\" I said.\n\nHe nodded as he surveyed the living room, and I think he knew I had taken the fast train to La-La Land then. *That’s okay,* I thought. *You won’t* *seem so critical of my actions soon.*  \n\nIn addition, I had flipped both couches on their sides and removed all the cushions; I stacked them outside behind the porch to burn for later on. The glass table in the living room wasn't problematic, but I needed to disassemble it to get at the rug underneath. I had rolled it into a loose roll and struggled with it across the yard. All furniture tucked up against the wall was brought forward and laid on its sides. I emptied all kitchen drawers, the contents from each worth saving I put in garbage bags, tied in triple knots, and set in the garage; the drawers themselves were put in the pile outside with the cushions and would be burned, too. I took down any framed pictures on the walls. And with the air vents sealed, I hardly felt any better.\n\n\"Uh-huh. Where's the basement, man?\"\n\nI led him down the hall to a door I had sealed completely with blue tape. He turned to me, smirking. \"How am I supposed to get down there?\" \n\nI went to grab the box cutter from the kitchen. A sheen of clammy sweat started to ooze from the pores on my forehead.\n\n\"Does that stuff do the job?\" I said, pointing to his tank of poison, the razor unsteady against the sealed crease in the door. \"No games. That stuff will do more than stun it, right? I want it to die...Okay?\"\n\n\"I got the shit for the circus, man.\" He patiently stepped aside and then watched as I cut the seal along the entire perimeter of the door. My heart was drumming.\n\n*It's right there behind the door, waiting to pounce. I know it is. It's going to be right there, BEHIND THE DOOR! OH, GOD! SOMEHOW IT KNOWS WHAT I’M DOING*\\-\n\n\"Hey, man.\"\n\nI looked up at the exterminator, light-headed from bending over. He was gripping the doorknob. How long had I been staring at the crack underneath the door?\n\n\"Relax. I'll find him. Your spider might be nasty, but once he gets a strong whiff of this...\" He cocked a thumb towards the tank on his back. \"...he'll be in spider heaven in two minutes. And if there's more, well, they say if you love your job, you won't have to work a day in your life.\"\n\nHis southern drawl forced a grin out of me, and in my throbbing panic, I almost thanked him for it. My palms were slimy with thick ooze, and I nodded rather than risk him hearing the terror in my words.\n\nHe opened the door, looked back to wink, and slowly began his descent. I expected a sizeable hairy creature to catapult through the air onto his chest at any moment, so I shrank away like a puppy who wants no part in meeting the big family dog. If there were more than one of those things, I didn’t know *what* I would do.  \n\n*Just find and kill the fucking thing,* I thought*. Get it over with. And kill anything else that moves, too. Hell, coat the whole house with poison! I don’t care!*\n\nI quickly shut the door. After a few seconds of heavy foot-falls, there came a distressing BANG. It sounded like he had overstepped and crashed to the bottom. Intermittent curses and harsh grunts drifted upwards. I listened at the door, touching the knob, and then expelled the breath I had been holding when his hasty, slightly amused voice resounded from below:\n\n\"Alright! Busted my ass, but I'll survive!\"\n\nI thought I heard the echo of a laugh, so I relaxed and went into the kitchen to make myself a sandwich. Spider-proofing the first floor of my house had made me ravenous. As I reached for a beer in the refrigerator to wash it down, I heard a bark of surprise from the basement and knocked the beer bottle over onto the floor. It shattered. I rushed down the hallway and pressed an ear against the door.\n\n\"Holy shit!\" he said. The sandwich suddenly felt like a piece of granite in my stomach. He was moving all over the place, hurriedly knocking boxes and containers away to pursue the spider. *Dear, God*, I thought. *The thing will get away. He'll lose sight of it. And then-*  \n\n\"Get back here! I ain't done with you!\" Something made of metal crashed to the floor. The exterminator's voice was full of crazed energy. \"Oh, you *are* an ugly thing! Shit!\"\n\nHe sounded like a madman angrily trying to locate his chemistry goggles. I heard his next words loud and clear with my ear planted firmly against the door. \n\n\"Well, well! Look at your friend! Let's see how he likes this!\"\n\n*Yeah! Cut him down, George! Beat Thomas the Big Boy to a pulp!* I thought crazily, ungluing my ear from the door.  \n\nAn enormous wave of fright overcame me, wrapping me in a mysterious cocoon of pure, spontaneous clarity. It was as if I had been hoisted into a pair of roller skates and pushed. I levitated towards the keys on the kitchen counter and flew through the front door. I landed on one knee on the hot concrete sidewalk. The spout of pain could have been as meniscal as a pinprick because I was still sprinting through the fresh-cut grass, both in body and mind. My breathing didn't matter, just the distance I covered.\n\nThe temperature inside the truck was a notch above sweltering, and I became alarmed when I could not get my fingers to stop shaking long enough to turn the ignition over. \n\n“Thomas the Big Boy Spider ‘gone git you!” I shouted, unaware I was giggling like a lunatic.  \n\nI counted to five and then inserted the key into the ignition again. The truck rumbled to life. I was dripping with sweat, skull throbbing, by the time the hot air turned cool. \n\n*Gonna leave a stranger in your house, David?*\n\n“Roger that.” \n\nI drove into town and turned into the McDonald’s. I got a sweet tea and parked, turning up the radio. The station was playing classic Jackson Browne and Neil Diamond. Although I was aware of the music on the stereo, I could hear the regular lub-dub of blood in my temples. As I started to turn the knob to another station, I noticed a discarded straw wrapper in between the cup holder and passenger seat. Right as I began reaching for it, my hand froze on the passenger seat cushion. I was suddenly so sure -*positive*\\- that there was a set of eight eyes watching me from the back. The door handle seemed a mile away. \n\nI lifted my gaze to the rear-view mirror, expecting to see eight legs reaching over the seat, but saw nothing. Resurgent terror constricted my windpipe. Instead, I yanked the door open and spewed my lunch onto the steaming pavement.\n\nThe exterminator was smoking a cigarette on the steps when I got back twenty minutes later. He watched me pull up the driveway and tipped me a wave. When I got out, I saw that he was heavily perspiring. Rivulets of sweat streamed down his red face. His coveralls were drenched inside and out, the poison tank leaning against one of the porch posts. He exhaled a mouthful of smoke. \n\n\"I sprayed the whole exterior of the house while you were away. I figured you wouldn’t mind,” he told me. \n\n\"Thank you,\" I croaked.\n\nHe looked at me steadily. \n\n“You okay, man?”\n\nI had to urinate badly, but the thought of going back into the house made me shiver.\n\n“No, not at fucking all,” I said. \n\nThe exterminator grinned, putting the butt out on the step and holding it with his thumb and index fingers.\n\n“If there is a Heaven and a Hell, Satan put those things on this earth for his amusement. The ugly fuckers exist for no other reason than to terrorize us.” He laughed, but it was uneasy. He stood up and went to the front door, beckoning me to follow. \"They’re aggressive, man, and don’t like me much.\"\n\nIt had been a chore entering that house again, but going to relieve myself in the bathroom was utterly unthinkable. \n\nI could tell my tape work on the air vents annoyed the exterminator because he looked at the one in the living room and shook his head.  \n\nAs if on cue, he said:\n\n“Mind if I get something out of the refrigerator, man? Throat is a little dry.”\n\nIt was more than that, though. The man was overheated and probably dizzy as hell. I felt bad. He came back with a beer and popped the cap off easily with his thick palms.    \n\n\"I originally thought they were huge wolf spiders,” he began, chugging half the bottle. “But their legs are different, hell, their behavior is different. I may just be the local guy somebody calls out to their house for the routine spraying, but I’ve always been the spider guy to my coworkers. I don't have a degree in the field, but I spend a lot of my free time researching them. I think what you have in the basement are Huntsman spiders. They are scarce around here. Over the past couple of decades, they've been slowly introduced into the lower southern parts of the U.S, but I never thought I'd see one this far north. They're indigenous to Australia, parts of Africa, and Asia. The farthest place north that I've ever heard of them being in is the Panhandle. They can be found in parts of Texas, too.\" He leaned against the wall nearest the kitchen, a hand gripping his heavy-duty belt, waiting for me to say something. When I didn't, he continued:\n\n\"They aren't that mean unless you come across a babe. The queens -my word, by the way- are always bat-shit and hostile. She'll stand guard around her spider nest and not eat for weeks sometimes. If you leave them alone, they tend to be fine. All they want to do is eat the bugs down there. They're nomadic, spending their time hunting and eating.” He took another long swallow. “But I think you've got a pretty pissed-off crew down there. They didn't take too lightly to me storming in and spraying them with my napalm. And- \n\nMy heart hammered. *Crew*. The word turned my blood into sloshing ice shavings.\n\n\"And what? How many were down there?\"\n\n“I’m intrigued. I thought it was just a straggler at first. I counted maybe five, but there's probably -most likely- more. You have a nasty infestation, man. The other thing, well, shit. Now I don’t want to tell you, but...Aw, *hell*, man. There’s one the size of a dinner plate down there.”\n\nHe recoiled from whatever he saw on my face. \n\n\"*Five? A goddamn dinner plate!*\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"You see, when I saw *that* gal, I nearly shit my pants.” He went on without pause, setting the empty beer bottle on the floor. “Also, when you see a bunch of them together like that, it usually means there's a spider nest somewhere near. A female Huntsman put a nest in your basement, and I’ll bet you a brand new suit that the huge one is our pissy little girl. That's what I think, and how wicked rude of her! I mean, really,” he said, shaking his head, probably in commiseration. \n\n*A fucking dinner plate,* I thought despairingly. *Happy Thanksgiving!*\n\nWords fell out of my mouth like verbal diarrhea.\n\n\"Motherfucker!\" I shouted. \"Are they poisonous? How many did you kill? Did you crush *it*?\" By “*it,*” I meant one spider in particular, but I didn’t have to elaborate any further.\n\nHe grinned, but it was strained.\n\n\"Their fangs *are* large enough to break through the skin, but their venom is not potent enough to cause harm. And, no, man, she got away. Pretty fast...” He turned and seemed to inspect the nearest wall. “Their bodies deflate like punctured tires when they die. Rest assured, a few got their medicine.”\n\nI couldn't believe what I was hearing. An exotic species of super spider had put a *shop* in my basement? I pointed crazily at the floor in the general direction of my despair.\n\n\"That's a big problem...\" I realized I had forgotten to ask his name earlier. “*What’s your name?*” \n\n\"AJ.\"\n\n\"AJ, that’s a big fucking problem!\"\n\nHe was nodding, but I figured he’d heard similar mantras in his loathsome profession over the years. \n\n\"I didn’t see any openings or cracks in the foundation when I walked the perimeter. I’m not even positive about *how* they got in. I sprayed for you nonetheless.”\n\nI wiped the bead of sweat making its way down the ridge of my nose.\n\n“Christ, what a shit show,” I said, more to myself. “I should just burn the whole damn thing down. *That’ll* be my annual basement cleansing.\"\n\nHe went on as if he hadn’t heard me.\n\n\"You can make a water-vinegar-based repellent if one gets too close for comfort.\" His voice wavered as he most likely recalled the *gal* down there. \"Spider infestations are tricky. Other pests tend to be a little easier to kill, but spiders…,” he trailed off. When he finished his thought, I stared at him incredulously and surprised myself with a chuckle. “Spiders are the dicks of the bug kingdom. It isn’t fool-proof, but I’d like to throw a bomb down there.”\n\n“A bomb?” I said. \n\nAJ laughed. \n\n“No, man. A bug bomb. Not a real one.” \n\nAJ called a helper named Rob, who looked younger than AJ when he arrived. Together they went in and set up the bug bomb while I remained outside. When they came back out not too long later, Rob was jittery and wild-eyed. He went directly to the van and got in. Seconds later, he left tire marks on the blacktop as he sped away.\n\n“Thought I was lying. Now he’s gonna quit,” AJ said. \n\nI turned to him. Despite the oppressive afternoon heat, he surveyed the speeding van, hands stuffed in his pockets.\n\n“*What?* Why?”\n\n“Said he would judge how big the fuckers were, I guess to prove he had balls. He almost butted heads with it on the rafters. Came within inches of a nasty surprise. He’s shaken up.”\n\nI looked back at the house. *Let’s hope it works,* I remember thinking. *This has got to work. Christ, this has got to work.*\n\nEvidently, I had spoken aloud, and now AJ followed my upward gaze.\n\n“I’m optimistic,” he said. We stood in silence for a moment.\n\n“Even if the bomb doesn’t work, man-\n\n“*Christ*, it better!”\n\n\"You can always burn the house down and use the insurance money to move someplace else.” \n\nHe winked. I stared at him, then winked back. In a few seconds, we were both laughing. I was not laughing as I watched him back out of the driveway.\n\n\\*\n\nIt's been four days since the bomb went off in my basement and three days since I overheard what Gray said in the grocery store. I thought I was getting better until then. I really did.\n\nA regular at my store, old man Gray was the good-natured type who always came in with that old-fashioned smile and pockets full of rattling loose change. He always came in alone, a lonely widower, and got out not because he had to but because he wanted to. I know it sounds silly, but there was a vibrant aura about him. The staff adored him, and although he'd somehow always manage to stop me mid-task on the floor, I never thought to utter a sharp or otherwise impatient word with him. This Monday afternoon, I was directing duties to my employees and taking care of some of my own when he came in. \n\nThe older man resembled a frightened skeleton; his eyes were more prominent, bulging in their wrinkled sockets. He shuffled up to one of my cashiers and said:\n\n\"Young lady, I'd appreciate it if you could make an old man feel better. It's rotten to come in here and ask, but...\" I crept forward, partially hidden in one of the aisles. He was fumbling in his pockets as if trying to find a few extra cents for a candy bar.\n\n\"Help *me*,\" he continued, his voice shaking now. \"Can you do that, young lady?\"\n\nMy cashier appeared uncomfortable, but she kept her tone steady and leaned forward.\n\n\"What's wrong, Mr.Gray? How can I help you, sir?\"\n\nOld man Gray leaned over the register, and for a second, I thought he was falling asleep right there. \n\n\"Oh, dear. I've gotten into such a fright. Forgive me, but I've never seen one so god awful *big*. Help me. Please. *Help*.\" I could hear the terror in his raspy voice. It was fine-tuned and unmistakable, and I knew what it was then.\n\n\"I left my house for the drug store this morning and came back...Lord, what I *saw*. I got back in my car and left again and came back later. It hasn't moved in hours as if it knows...*it knows!\"*\n\nMy cashier flicked her eyes in my direction, and I stepped out of the aisle. She was saying: \n\n\"I don't understand-\n\nOld man Gray threw his head to the ceiling and howled.\n\n\"*All those eyes! Watching me! It's on my front door, and I can't get near it! Please, somebody help! Please, please, please!\"*\n\nThat evening, after work, I pulled up into my driveway and sat behind the wheel, staring at the eerie dark of the front porch. I remembered the hair-raising words from Gray: *All those eyes! Watching me!*\n\nSince bombing my basement, I’ve been researching the Huntsman spider. All of this has done very little to absolve my fears. I learned that they are nocturnal creatures, carrying out meticulous and ruthless attacks on unsuspecting prey at night. Basically, they will eat whatever succumbs to them. Moreover, I learned that they often wander into homes and vehicles in Australia. Motherfucking perfect.\n\nI’ve learned AJ *does* know what he is talking about.\n\nStill sitting in my truck, staring at my front door, I thought of AJ’s words: *Their fangs are large enough to break through the skin, but their venom is not potent enough to cause harm...* \n\nSleeping in the truck isn’t an option; it’s too hot. I’ll have to force myself to sleep in the living room tonight.\n\n\\*\n\nIt's July 30th, 2022. This morning, Dee came and saw what I had done to the house. I tried explaining to her that we have a spider infestation in the basement. She wouldn’t listen. When she saw that I had placed all of her belongings -including most of her clothes and jewelry- in multiple garbage bags and set them in the garage, she left in a rage of squealing tires. I don’t have time to worry about it, though, because I think the Huntsmen are in the attic now.\n\nAnd trust me, that is enough worry for me. \n\n\\*\n\nIt's August 1st, and I’ve started a large bonfire in the backyard. So far, I have burned most of the furniture in the house. The fire at its highest intensity was nearly as high as the first floor. If I’m being honest, this brought me comfort, but now I am exhausted. The neighbors are worried about me. They told me they called the fire department, but they have not shown up yet.\n\nI’m wondering what’s taking them so long.  \n\nBy nightfall, the fire was more of a small campfire. Dead tired and drenched, I watched the bright red and orange embers in the coals swell in and out like a torched heart. Tomorrow, if the fire department does not dissuade me, I might get back at it.\n\n\\*\n\nAugust 6th. I don't think AJ’s bomb worked. I have not ventured down into the basement; I have only put my ear to the door. My house is empty. The bottom floor looks like a white room with a hardwood floor. The master bedroom upstairs is cleaned out save for the bare mattress plopped on the carpet in the middle of the room. Not that I have slept on it. I am too scared to sleep, and I dream of large webs when I do. I sealed both sinks with whole rolls of duct tape and did the same to the shower and bathtub drains in case something was in the pipes. I haven't showered. I haven’t brushed my teeth. I think I am losing it, but then and again, I swear I think they are watching me. \n\nAccording to the local paper, last Sunday, the 2nd of August, a man stumbled into an emergency room holding his hand in a fit of agony. *The Newtonville Star* described the incident as an \"infrequent but scary occurrence.\" The victim was interviewed a day later in his hospital bed. Quote: \"It was the biggest spider I ever saw. It leaped onto my hand in my attempt to trap it,\" he told the reporter. \"I guess that's what I get for trying to dispose of it the humane way (laughter). The terrifying part was how hard it was to get off. It scared my wife and me to death.\" He was expected to recover quickly.\n\nTwo days later, on the 4th of August, there was a nasty four-car pile-up on Hwy 70 East leaving Newtonville at around two in the afternoon. A child was killed and five people injured when a red minivan suddenly swerved sharply towards the right shoulder and then turned and crisscrossed three lanes of traffic. One bystander described the scene as \"almost apocalyptic.\" Another bystander provided insight into the terrible accident. The local news station reported on his testimony. Quote: \"I was in the middle lane when it happened. The car was on my right side, and when I looked that way, the woman behind the wheel was flailing around like she was locked in there with a wild animal or something.” That woman received a few deep lacerations and a broken arm, they said. Still, she was \"hysterical\" and \"extremely physical\" when paramedics tried to get her on the stretcher.\n\nLater that day, a black Chevy Cruz rolled down Main Street in Newtonville with the front door wide open. Nobody was in the car, but a few witnesses on the street sidewalk said they saw a frantic man in a white T-shirt jump out minutes before.\n\nA few days ago, I stopped driving the Chevy, not because there was one of them in it, but because there could have been. And let me tell you, somehow, that's worse than finding one on the floorboard or looking into the rear-view mirror to see one spread out over the rear glass window. When you fear what lurks in unfathomable places, there is a persistent terror in every particle that grazes your skin, every step you take outside your domain, and every position you try to sleep in. This is what it has become for me.\n\nI power-washed my old Harley thoroughly for over an hour today and did the same thing with the helmet. It's amazing how many objects we take for granted are safe when there could likely be a creature hidden along its depths or nestled in a gap intent on striking. *I know that bike is clean*, I'd tell myself. *I know there's nothing in that helmet*. But when I blink, is it possible that something changed, something moved in that tiny fraction of a second?\n\n\\*\n\nIt’s August 7th. Last night I decided I couldn't sleep another night here. I became obsessed with the idea that they were moving inside the walls. With only the week-long clothes on my back, I took the Harley-Davidson northward and stopped in Wilson, a large rural community on the verge of becoming a small city. I booked a few nights at a Super 8 and requested a room on the first floor, just in case I needed to get out of the building in a hurry. \n\nThose bedside lamp-light domes were weak, and I thought I saw a Huntsman perched underneath the air-conditioning unit at the window, shrouded in shadow amid the sickly glow. It was nothing but my ill imagination. Surprise, surprise.\n\nStill...I find myself looking back now and again as I write. *Is* it my imagination?\n\nAfter doing a thorough but cautious search of the bathroom, I took a long shower. As I wiped the condensation from the mirror, a haggard man reflected back on me. I almost didn’t recognize his naked eyes. \n\nI stripped the comforter and sheets off the bed and made sure the room was clear of anything that moved in plain sight. In doing this, I realized I had forgotten my Mac back in Newtonville. I begrudgingly retrieved it, reminding myself not to forget anything else. \n\nBefore I left again, I began thinking about that big pile of estranged wood that was once my home. The culmination of these thoughts landed me in a fit of rage that I fear I cannot put into words. Maybe it was what I perceived as hundreds of tiny insect-like eyes staring out at me from the tree line, mocking me. Any home that shelters such evil doesn't deserve to be a home for anything. It drew those Huntsman spiders in, and if I couldn't live there contently, *they* couldn't fucking live there.\n\nI got a call from Dee very early this morning. She had awoken me from a fevered sleep, screaming and sobbing at the same time that our house had gone up in flames.\n\n“*There's nothing left! It's all gone, David!*”\n\n*Tell it to Upton, you fucking whore,* I thought. It was delightful. It was more than pleasing.  \n\nIt made me laugh, and I knew she could pick it up the many miles in between us. When she had calmed down after a minute or so, I said:\n\n\"At least David doesn’t have a spider problem anymore. I’m sure Upton has a room in that big house of his for all of your precious shit, Denise.\" She was saying something else, but I didn’t get a word of it. I ended the call. \n\nI know better than to settle in, despite the room appearing safe. I may be traveling a lot. Who knows how far north these spiders will travel, carried further and further by some dumb insect-like intuition we humans cannot understand? Who's to say there isn't one underneath the box spring waiting for me to go to bed? Or one behind that cushioned chair in the corner? And worst of all, who's to say that there isn't one currently creeping closer and closer to my feet?\n\nI know one fucking thing, my friends. Fire seems to take some of the edge off, and there are a lot of potential Huntsman infestations in Newtonville and beyond.",

        "text": "This time of year is always hard for me. Ten years ago, on February 13th, my boyfriend went missing. His body was found washed up on the edge of the river bank the next day.\n\nMatt and I had been dating for three years, and it would have been three years on Valentine's Day. He was sweet and mature, unlike a lot of the boys at our school. I remember that Valentine's Day, he wrote me a poem in a handmade card and left it with a single rose on my desk. It had a question at the bottom: \"Will you be mine?\" I, of course, said yes; how could I say no?!\n\nI know this sounds silly looking back, considering we were so young, but we made big plans for our future. I couldn't see any other reality than us being together. He and his family lived just around the corner from mine, and we often sneaked out to our local park. The nights we spent planning every detail of our future under the stars were magical.\n\nMy world began to fall apart when I got home from school one night. I had been worrying all day that I hadn't heard from Matt and thought it was unusual that he hadn't at least text me. As I walked through my front door, there was a man and woman sitting in our living room. My parents were with them, and I could see in my mother's teary, red-rimmed eyes that something bad had happened. The evening and the next day were a blur as the two detectives explained how Matt was missing, then how they found his lifeless body in the frozen river the next day. My Valentine's Day was spent alone drowning in my own tears.\n\nThat was until there was a knock on the door around 8 pm that day. My dad opened the door to find a single rose. It had a small note attached that read: \"Amy, I Love You.\"\n\nWhen my father handed me the freshly cut rose and the small note, my heart dropped as I knew it was from Matt. Part of me even refused to believe he was gone, but the subsequent funeral and memorials made me face reality, even if it hit me like a freight train. I still had a shred of hope. I didn't go to school for a few weeks after. I just couldn't face it; the questions, the staring, it was all too much. Reliving this now still pains my heart.\n\nA year had nearly passed, and even though I had started smiling and going out with friends again, the scars still ran deep. There was a small anniversary memorial for family and close friends, and Matt's family was equally supportive of me as I was of them. After I got home from the memorial, I found a single rose delicately placed on our doormat. My stomach dropped as I noticed the same handwritten note was attached. My parents were slightly concerned, but I didn't feel any malice or creepiness; I knew it was from him.\n\nAs I placed the rose in a small vase of water and put it in the center of my windowsill, I smiled as a tear ran down my face. As the years went on, I kept this tradition, and the single rose was always at my door each Valentine's Day. I know that this sounds like a sick, twisted joke from someone taking advantage of the tragedy, but in my mind, it was a small sign from Matt. In that moment, I felt his love once again.\n\nFive years later, I met my soon-to-be husband, Luke. He was aware of my past struggles with relationships, but he was patient and understanding. I knew he was the one for me, and we got married two years ago. We moved into our first house that summer after living in a rental apartment.\n\nHowever, the annual rose and note continued to follow me, causing tension between Luke and me. He believed that someone was playing a cruel joke on me, but I had a different view. On last Valentine's Day, Luke threw the rose and note away, as he said he didn’t like the fact some creep was sending me these kind of things. This led to a heated argument, that resulted in me crying myself to sleep while he slept on the couch. The next day, I found a crushed decaying rose, it had a broken heart hand-drawn on the attached note in my mailbox. I held it in my shaking hand as I went inside, I broke down as I placed the remains of ‘our’ flower and heart breaking note in my bedside table. \n\nIn the following months after, strange things began to occur in our house. The TV would turn on in the middle of the night, cupboards would  open themselves while we were at work, and footsteps were heard at night outside on the decking. Luke decided he would install cameras outside but they showed nothing. That was until last week, the backyard camera captured a shadowy dark figure moving across the outside wall, by our back door one night. \n\nLuke told me that the security app alerted him at 2:25am, he then got out of bed and went to check no one had broken in. As he walked into the kitchen, suddenly the lights began to buzz and flicker above him. He then felt a sharp pain as something scratched down his bare back. I came running downstairs to check on him, after I heard his pain induced cry. I saw five deep red scratches run down his back. After I had cleaned his wounds and we had calmed down a bit, we went back to bed. I watched the footage back the next morning and it indeed captured the looming shadowy figure outside. That’s when I noticed, it was holding a flower. \n\nIt was the silhouette of a rose.\n\nThe grief and guilt I felt in that moment was incomprehensible. How Matt was still trying to show his love for me from beyond the grave and I had moved on and shut him out.\n\nI now feel terrified on what may happen to me or Luke, this upcoming Valentine’s Day.",

        "text": " \n\n*It is 17th November, 2008. Ella has turned eleven.*\n\n“Make a wish!”\n\nAt that moment, somewhere outside her house, someone threw a stone at a stray. It wailed. The cry echoed in her ears as she shut her eyes.\n\n*I wish it would end.* \n\nInside, even she knew just one little girl could never change the world.\n\n*It is 17th November, 2018. Ella has turned twenty one. Ten years have passed since she made the wish.*\n\nShe doesn’t believe in wishes anymore. Luckily for her, someone else does.\n\nShe opened her bedroom window, letting the cool night air blow over her. The celebrations were over. She was alone. She got into bed and opened a book. Suddenly, the entire room became dark. One by one, the windows of houses opposite that provided the last meager strips of light in her room vanished. She got up to feel her way to the light switch, but it was hard to move her legs as her room seemed to be moving like a train. *Which was not possible,* she reminded herself.  She felt strange, but also normal at the same time. The next second, it was the very opposite; as though she were a feather floating in space. She stretched out her hand, but now even the bed that had been right next to her was not there anymore. Her room, the nightstand, the breeze were all gone. She looked around. There was nobody.\n\nOr so she thought.\n\n“I’ve wanted to meet you for a long time, Ella.” \n\nShe swung around. Slowly, a candle started glowing. Little by little, the single candle made the place light up. The glow continued past, into an endless space, as far as she could see and beyond that.\n\nThe speaker was someone she’d never seen before. He was human, but he seemed to emanate a radiance that, unexplainably, made her feel safe, comforted and free, like a bird, who could fly whenever and wherever she wanted, someone with no problems in the world.\n\n“I’m sorry, but I don’t really know who you are.”\n\n“Ah, but it doesn’t really matter. Everyone soon becomes a nobody, not remembered, not spoken of, *obliviated.”*\n\nShe frowned, puzzled.\n\n“Do you know what kindness is, Ella?”\n\n“Um, yes.”\n\nHe gazed into the flame. “Kindness costs nothing.” he looked up. “Go make sure that evil costs something.” \n\nHe handed the candle to her. And in the blink of an eye, he was gone. \n\nShe waited for someone else to appear, but there was no one. The flame of the candle turned purple. It rose into the air and turned into a purple orb. Then it entered her palm. She glowed purple for a second.\n\n*It is 18th November, 2018. Ella woke up, sweating.*\n\nThe book was on her nightstand. She was in bed. She slowly calmed down. “Just a dream.” she said, slowly. “It was just a dream.” \n\n“Just a dream.” repeated someone else, smiling.\n\n*It is the year 2020. A man is watching the news.*\n\n“Several people have been reported missing recently, centered in the country of India. The pattern suggests that all the victims were animal abusers-” Here the channel abruptly switched to an advertisement.\n\nSomewhere, a man drove his old farm dog to the edge of the city. He stopped and pulled the dog out. His dog romped around him, not knowing that his master did not want him anymore. The man had heard the news, of course. He had to be cautious about abandoning the dog. He looked around carefully. The only sound he heard was a cool breeze and his dog’s excited panting. He tied the leash to a pole and got into his truck. His dog whined as he drove away. *It was probably a game,* he thought. He strained against the leash.\n\nThere was a blinding flash. The truck jolted as the man hit the brakes. A woman appeared in front of him. Before he could even speak, she lifted her hand. A purple flare shot out of it. And then he was gone. Only she and his dog were left. She picked it up, and with a swish of her cloak, was gone too.\n\n*It is the year 2021. A news anchor gestures at a graph behind him.*\n\nThe line climbed upwards slowly and then collapsed in an almost straight line. “The end of animal abuse in India…” he began.\n\nOne wish. One moment. One night.\n\nShe’d done it; The little girl had changed the world.",

        "text": "Blood soaked the floor of the entire hallway laid out in front of me. I looked at all the bodies laying in pieces around me. How did I get here, I thought to myself. What’s happening?\n\n“Look at me,” a voice said from behind me. I turned and saw a doctor in a lab coat, his face a frozen, expressionless mask in front of me. His eyes had a glint of concern in them. “Are you OK? Are you hurt?”\n\n“What’s… what’s going on?” I asked, confused. He shook his head.\n\n“That’s a long story,” he said.\n\n“I have time,” I responded. Then a memory came to me.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n“This is a mutated form of ebola,” the young woman said in front of me through her gas mask, holding the vial of clear liquid up with a gloved hand. I backed up instinctively.\n\n“And just why the hell are you keeping it here?!” I asked, my heart racing.\n\n“This is just a last resort,” she said. “In case the citizens ever try to rebel. We can release the virus and the federal government will go ahead and impose martial law. A dictatorship will form in the USA, and it will be run by the military, with every road blocked off and every citizen imprisoned in his house, only allowed to go out to work *if* we allow them.”\n\n“Well, I don’t want to be anywhere near that crap,” I said, angry and afraid. “You should destroy it. If that gets out, it would spread like wildfire with a massive death rate. People would be bleeding out on the streets, waiting in lines for the hospital miles long as every vital service in every city shut down. It would be the end of our society. Who would *do* such a thing? Just to keep power?”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI came back to the present moment, the doctor staring at me with his cold, gray eyes, impassively looking through me.\n\n“Ah, you look like you’re starting to remember,” he said, the first traces of a smile forming on his face.\n\n“So, it got out,” I said flatly, unsurprised. \n\n“Yes, yes, sadly, it did,” he said. “But the good news is, you have a genetic mutation. You’re not even affected. Except for the memory loss.”\n\n“The memory loss?” I asked, still feeling unsure. There was too much going on, it felt like, and I only had one tiny piece of what I needed. And then it all came flooding back to me.\n\n“No, no memory loss,” I said, grinning. “I remember *everything.*”\n\nAnd so I did.\n\nThat morning had started like any other. I drank a cup of coffee, ate breakfast, smoked a cigarette, and got in my car to go to work. I was just a janitor at a medical research facility. It was a blackops site, requiring high security clearance, so I was paid significantly more than any normal janitor. But this wasn’t exactly what I wanted to do with my life. It wasn’t my plan when I joined the Army to end up mopping hallways and cleaning up vomit for a living.\n\nOn the way to work, I saw a homeless man with crazy-looking hair sticking up all over his head on the city street outside our facility. He held up a cardboard sign, and across it, scrawled in black permanent marker, he had written, “The End is Near. Have you made peace yet?”\n\n“Fucking crazy asshole,” I said to myself. He appeared to be talking to himself incessantly, a worn brown longcoat covering his thin, shaking frame. I kept driving, coming to the security gate and flashing my ID card. \n\nAs I walked into the building, I realized the halls were totally empty. Where was everyone? Normally doctors, nurses, scientists, patients and family members crowded the hallways and I had a hard time pushing through. This was one of the few places that accepted poor people from the surrounding area for medical research trials. They had experimental cancer treatments that they gave low-income patients for free, as long as they signed an NDA and agreed to be subjected to medical testing whenever necessary. But there were far darker things in this building than that. The bottom floors also tested out new mutations in biological weapons agents as well as certain experimental chemical weapons, mostly on prisoners or homeless people or others that no one would notice were missing.\n\n“Anthony,” someone said from behind me. I turned to notice a beautiful, red-headed young female doctor standing there, one I had talked to only a few times before, named Dr. Kreutzmann.\n\n“Hi, Dr. Kreutzmann,” I said happily, sipping at my coffee. “Where *is* everyone today?”\n\n“Today is a special day,” she said cryptically. “We are testing out a new agent. No one is allowed in that is not necessary for the hospital’s functioning, or for the test we are carrying out. It is rated Category 5, so you know the drill.” I did. Category 5 referred to the most dangerous bioweapons agents in the world- smallpox, mutated forms of rabies that could spread through the air, bioengineered flu strains that caused bleeding from every orifice in most subjects, and other things even worse that the government liked to keep concealed from everyday citizens. I felt suddenly anxious. I didn’t like being around that stuff at all. The happiness I had felt as I drove in on this sunny summer morning drained out of me. Frowning at her, I nodded slowly.\n\n“Anyways, I’m sorry to say that this isn’t purely a social call,” Dr. Kreutzmann said to me, the corners of her lips turning up into the faintest traces of a smile. “The other doctors and I involved in Agent Kali, which is the classified name for the substance, wanted to know if you could give us some extra help today, securing the patients and all that. Some of them are bad people, Anthony, taken from the Islamic State or from the supermax federal prisons across the country. We need as many hands on deck as we can get.”\n\n“Is there a bonus involved?” I asked, looking directly into her eyes. Her smile widened.\n\n“Yes, yes, we will add $500 to your paycheck for eight hours work, on top of your usual hourly wage. An extra $500 for a single day’s work. Will you help or not?” I thought about it for a fraction of a second. I really needed the extra money- my daughter was just told she needed braces, and I didn’t have the thousands of dollars required for the trips to the orthodontist. I sighed.\n\n“Sure, $500, you got a deal,” I said, shaking her hand.\n\nI followed her to the lowest floor of the building, five stories undeneath the ground floor. We took an elevator, requiring a special key and an optical scanner. I had clearance to go down there any time I wanted to clean, but I tried to spend as little time down there as I could. The place was, in a word, creepy.\n\nOn each side of the wall, cell after cell lay, each with an individual in it. Some had a Middle Eastern look with long beards, others were Mexican or Central American with tattoos covering every inch of their body, even their faces, and a few looked like just regular working-class white guys with blank smiles and eyes that stared far off into the distance. “Those are probably the serial killers,” I thought to myself, resisting the sudden, absurd urge to begin laughing. As all those eyes followed me and Dr. Kreutzmann down the hall, I felt my armpits growing sweaty, my forehead being covered in a slight sheen as my heart beat too fast in my chest. I hated being down here. Why did I need to do things like this to make extra money?\n\nThe hall ended in a large laboratory the size of thirty or forty of the cells across. Dozens of scientists and doctors in white lab coats were finishing the final preparations for the experiment, double-checking the labels on each vial, writing a few last words into the computers, preparing the gas masks and biohazard suits we would all wear that were necessary for any Category 5 agent trials.\n\nWithin a few minutes, the final preparations were complete, and we were all in our gas masks and biohazard suits. Only the prisoners in the cells were still unprotected. Everyone gathered around the tall doctor in the middle of the room, looking like a SWAT officer with his gas mask and black plastic covering. I recognized him as someone I had seen around but never talked to. His name was Dr. Viserio, and he had a loud booming voice and a natural leadership quality that allowed him to quickly take over any situation. He was also the head doctor on Category 5 bioweapons agents, responsible for containment, human experimentation and all other facets of learning about and containing such deadly substances.\n\n“First, let me say just how *proud* I am of all of you,” he said, looking around the room slowly. “A few years ago, when we started this project, the idea of aerosolizing and mutating this amazing virus was just a pipedream. But with all of your hard work, dedication, and commitment, we have made the impossible possible- we have come out ahead of schedule, ahead of budget and now have a working candidate for Agent Kali.\n\n“The agent will be released in thirty seconds,” the doctor said, looking at the watch on his wrist covered under a layer of clear plastic sleeving, his voice muffled and distant-sounding through the mask. He pointed at the vents that led from the containment room at the right side of the laboratory to each of the cells on the floor. “It is airborne and will be released via ventilation shaft to each of the prisoners. When that happens, we will begin to open the doors and let them interact. We will take refuge in the auxiliary containment room-” he pointed across the laboratory to the left side where another room with bullet-proof glass and oxygen tanks stood- “and examine the subjects for any psychological or physical symptoms. We will keep video footage and take notes of all reactions, including the exact time and which subject they happen to. You will notice on the cameras that each of the subjects has a large number sewn into the front and back of his uniform. That will be how you will mark down in each subject in the notes. Does anyone have any questions?”\n\nNo one did.\n\n“OK, OK, then let’s go!” he said, ushering the crowd into the auxiliary containment room. A buzzing sound went off behind us in the main containment room on the other side of the laboratory. “The agent has been released! You now have sixty seconds to get into the room and lock the door before each of the subjects is released from their cells. In case of danger, the auxiliary containment room has tranquilizer guns as well as semi-automatic assault rifles with extra pre-loaded clips along the back wall. Remember that information. It could *save your life.*”\n\nAs soon as we were all safely in the containment room and the door was locked behind us, a second buzzer went off. With a slamming sound, all the doors of the cells opened and out stepped the subjects- terrorists, rapists, murderers, serial killers and gang members. All of them were men.\n\nA row of cameras showed every possible angle of every part of the laboratory, halls and cells in extremely high-resolution, countless computers recording every second of action and making copies for this vital trial. Dr. Kreutzmann grabbed my arm, and took me to the side of the auxiliary containment room far away from the crowd, holding up a vial.\n\n“This is a mutated form of ebola…” she began saying, and the memory ended. \n\nI came back to the present moment, standing in the hallway with blood and bodies all around me. Both the doctor and I had taken off our biohazard suits and gas masks. We both had the mutation, and each of us knew it. We couldn’t be infected. Only 5% of the population had the mutation that made them immune to Agent Kali, and he had specifically chosen me to come down and join the experiment after looking at through the mutations in my DNA. I didn’t even realize they had taken and sequenced my DNA when I started working here, but in the process of being hired, they took my fingerprints and saliva samples, and had apparently done more with the latter than I ever realized.\n\n“Did you follow all of the rules?” Dr. Viserio asked.\n\n“You know I did,” I said. “Why do you think we are the only two still alive?”\n\n“OK, but do you *remember* the rules?” he said, smirking slightly. The sudden rush of so many memories had made me feel light-headed and dissociated. I tried to think back, frowning. Then more memories came flooding back, some I didn’t even realize I had forgotten.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n“Rule number one,” Dr. Viserio said to all of us, speaking as loudly as he could to counteract the muffling effect of his gas mask, “no one gets in or out. Anyone who tries to leave this place must be shot on sight. If this virus gets out, it will have a 90% death rate and kill billions of people. There will be no way to close Pandora’s box once it is opened.\n\n“Rule number two, if the buzzer goes off, grab a rifle, open the auxiliary room containment door with that button-” he pointed to a large red button next to the door- “and shoot anyone that approaches.\n\n“Rule number three, if the lights start flashing, *close your eyes* and keep them closed while you count to 100. Agent Kali is known to cause psychic powers in certain individuals, but they can only harm you or take control of your body if your eyes are open. In animal subjects, the psychic powers are fleeting and can be detected beforehand. We have added such detectors throughout every square inch of this floor. These psychic powers never last more than 100 seconds.” He finished speaking, putting his arms down. The silence felt deafening.\n\nI noticed there were no rules about taking off our biohazard suits or gas masks. I didn’t realize it then, but they offered absolutely no protection against Agent Kali. Everyone in both the auxiliary containment room and all of the cells had already been exposed. The virus was so small that it was able to slip underneath the microscopic cracks of the door to the containment rooms, and even slip through gas masks or get underneath the biohazard suits and be absorbed through the skin.\n\nThe speed at which the virus began working on the subjects was astounding. Within sixty seconds after leaving their cells, some of them were crying blood, their eyes covered in a layer of crimson tears. Others began bleeding out of every orifice, throwing up blood across the floors of the hallway while more flowed out of their eyes and ears. These most susceptible people quickly dropped, perhaps 50% of the subjects, and within minutes of watching the cameras, bodies littered the entire place. \n\nBut those who only cried blood were the most interesting of all. One of them, a huge blonde serial killer with the number 22 on his shirt, looked at a Mexican man across the hall with the number 37 on his shirt. Within seconds, the Mexican man flew up into the ceiling, as if pulled up by invisible hands, his neck snapping as he hit the metal top of the hallway. Then he fell to the floor, limp as a ragdoll, his bloody eyes staring blankly up as he died.\n\nThe lights began flashing, and the doctor said, “Here it comes! It’s starting! Prepare yourselves.”\n\nI felt anything but prepared.\n\nI closed my eyes and listened. Outside, I heard terrible shrieks, bodies flying around as they hit the walls and ceilings. The computers and medical equipment of the main laboratory begain flying each way, as if a poltergeist had possessed the entire level.\n\nFocusing on my breathing and trying to calm my racing heart, I slowly counted to 100. I definitely didn’t want to risk counting too fast and opening my eyes, only to find it had only been 95 seconds instead of 100, and that now I was going to die from some bizarre psychic phenomenon of a poorly-understood bioengineered virus.\n\nI opened my eyes, and saw that most of the prisoners were dead. Some of them were in pieces, as if ripped apart by ropes or chains. Legs and arms littered each side of the laboratory floor.\n\nThe door to the auxiliary containment room started to issue an alarm, then slowly swung open.\n\n“Who the fuck is opening the door?” a panicked voice cried from next to me. I couldn’t see anyone near the red button, but as if done by a ghost, I saw it began to press inwards. As it went all the way in, the door flew open, and outside the room stood a wall of a dozen men, formed in a semi-circle, all with crying bloody eyes.\n\n“Grab the guns!” Dr. Viserio said. People began frantically running towards the tranquilizer guns and assault rifles on the back wall. Just then, the buzzer began frantically sounding as each of the men stepped forward in unison. At the same time, the lights began to flicker. \n\n“What the fuck do I do now?” I thought to myself, too petrified to speak. Did I close my eyes, since the lights were flashing, or did I shoot anyone that came towards the containment room? How was I supposed to shoot with my eyes closed?\n\nI stepped in front of the crowd, closing my eyes and began rapidly shooting towards the front door with the AR-15 I held in my arms. I had no idea whether I was hitting anything, but I heard a few bullets connect with meaty thuds. The roaring of the gunshots made my ears ring, and I heard countless screams from all around me. I tried to block it all out and find some center of peace inside during the mayhem. I slowly counted to 100 as I kept firing, and to my surprise, when I reached 100, I was still alive.\n\nI couldn’t say the same for most of the staff in the auxiliary containment room. Many of them had been ripped to shreds, pieces of skin and muscle littering the walls and tables, gore completely covering the screens of the security camera feeds. Looking around, I saw only Dr. Kreutzmann, Dr. Viserio and myself still standing. The dozens of other staff members, doctors and scientists all died while I had my eyes closed.\n\nThen, in a moment of total horror, I heard the elevator doors opening down the hall. I sprinted blindly, changing the detachable magazine with a fresh one as I went, almost slipping on the trails of blood and body pieces everywhere, but made it just as the elevator door started to close. The tall blonde serial killer with the number 22 was standing there, crying blood and smiling from ear to ear. I started shooting as fast as I could, and his head exploded just as the doors closed. I sighed in relief, hitting the button to stop the elevator from ascending, where it would bring horrors unimaginable to the world above.\n\nThen, like a tidal wave, a total feeling of amnesia and memory loss overtook me. I found myself standing there, trying to remember what I was doing or who I was, but nothing came to me.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI came back to the present, where Dr. Viserio and I stood, looking at each other.\n\n“What happened to Dr. Kreutzmann?” I asked, and he shook his head sadly.\n\n“She didn’t end up having the mutation. She bled out a few minutes ago.”\n\nJust then, the elevator door pinged, and a man stepped out, crazy hair all over his head, his worn brown longcoat showing holes all over. He looked past me, staring with hatred at Dr. Viserio, and took a hangun out of his inner coat pocket, shooting the doctor in the head before I could respond. Remembering rule number one, I raised my rifle towards him. He put up his hands.\n\n“You don’t have to do that,” he said. “Look, Dr. Viserio was a sick and sadistic man. He had to die.” The man pulled out a wallet from his pocket, showing me a CIA badge. “He didn’t have clearance to begin human experimentation with Agent Kali. Now we have to destroy this entire building. And we both need to get out of here.”\n\n“Aren’t you going to get sick, though?” I asked, unsure. I wondered whether I should shoot him, whether this was some sort of trick.\n\n“No, no, like you, I have the mutation. But we have to go *now.* The CIA is going to blow up this building in fifteen minutes. We’ll just say it was a gas leak or something, that’s not my department to make up cover stories, but you’re innocent in all of this. So come with me. Let’s get the hell out of this place!” And I did. We ascended up the elevator and there was a black Ford Taurus waiting for us outside which took us far away from that den of horrors.\n\nThey had me sign an NDA which said I would never tell anyone what I had witnessed during the experiment with Agent Kali. They said if I broke that NDA, I would go to federal prison for the rest of my life. But they also paid me $500,000 to keep my mouth shut. The carrot and the stick, I guess. But I wasn’t complaining.\n\nNow I didn’t have to worry about money again for a long time.",

        "text": "  \n\nIf I had to watch Haley glare in my direction one more time while I finished unloading the moving truck, I might poke my eyes out. If you bought most girls a house, they’d be delighted. Especially in this housing market! But not Haley. If looks could kill, I’d be a dead man and she’d be stepping over my body to load all her shit back into the truck.\n\nHaley’s dad threw me a half-smile, “With a little sweat and some good old-fashioned ingenuity this place is going to feel just like home. You look like you got the sweating part down pretty good. How about the other half?”\n\nI chuckled a little at that. Haley’s dad had always been a solid guy. If he wasn’t careful, Haley might have started trying to murder him with her eyes too. With her long legs, she might be able to jump clear over both of us lying dead on the front lawn.\n\nI snatched up the last box with a groan and lugged it through the front door of our new home.\n\nI leaned over the pizza box and ate like a starving man. Haley was the only person I knew who could scowl while eating pizza. I still loved her though.\n\nFinally, she spoke. “Derek, you didn’t even ask me for my opinion at all! This was a huge decision and you completely shut me out! A surprise, I get it, but Jesus! Next time just buy me some flowers or something.”\n\nI dropped my half-eaten slice of pizza back into the box and stared at her. I put myself just over a hundred and sixty thousand dollars in the hole for her to be pissed off over closet size and not having granite counter tops. \n\nFor a split second I considered telling her how much this house was really worth and why we got it so far under value. Had we been married already, I might have.\n\n“Good thing your dad helped me bring the couch in. I’ll see you in the morning.” I needed a shower to cool me off in more ways than one.\n\nThat night, I was convinced we must have damaged the couch during the move. It was lumpier than I remembered. Nonetheless, exhaustion eventually took over. \n\nAs my eyes fluttered in the moments between being awake and asleep, someone at least six inches taller than Haley turned the corner from the living room into the kitchen. I irrationally attempted to cram myself inside of the couch as my eyes bulged. In my sleep-muddled mind, I’d found the truth. One of the poor fuckers who died in this house was still here and he was going to kill me.\n\nMy tension sore body relaxed slightly as I made up my mind. I had to know for sure. My creeping posture most resembled a praying mantis which struck me as ironic as I sure as hell was praying as I snuck into the kitchen. \n\nIn the furthest corner in front of the basement door, the thing hid in the shadows. I let out a yelp and hit the light switch. It was gone.\n\nI swore and pulled at my hair as I walked to my bedroom to wake Haley. She was really going to kill me now. Not only did she hate the house I’d attempted to surprise her with - it was haunted.\n\nI didn’t have time to be pleasant. I put both hands on Haley’s back and shook her. Before she had a chance to react, I word-vomited the truth.\n\n“The realtor said the house was worth closer to 225 thousand but the last two families to live here died. It’s fucking haunted. I just saw something in the god damn kitchen. I just wanted to prove I could give you a good life and I think I just guaranteed pretty soon we aren’t going to have any kind of life at all.” \n\nBetween Haley’s wild hair, bugged-out bewildered eyes, her protruding jaw, and the hysteria from what I’d seen in the kitchen, my mind broke. What started as a small chuckle worked its way into a bellowing laugh that heaved its way unwelcome through my mouth. Haley shot up and whacked me twice with her pillow. It didn’t hurt, but the blow brought me back.\n\n“We aren’t talking about this tonight. Lay down. Don’t speak to me. Don’t even *think* about speaking to me. You’re exhausted and I’m sure you’ve been mulling when you were going to spill this to me through your stupid, *stupid* brain all night. You’re seeing things. Just go to sleep and *don’t* talk to me.” \n\nI knew she was afraid. I knew she didn’t think I was seeing things. And she knew I knew. But what else were we going to do in the middle of the night? I lowered myself onto the bed, flat on my back. I wouldn’t sleep, of that I was sure, but at least I could rest my eyes. At least I was back in bed next to her.\n\nLess than fifteen minutes had passed before Haley gripped my forearm and sunk her nails in. My stomach dropped for the second time as my eyes settled on the thing in the corner. \n\nIt was much closer this time. Its long teeth jutted from its mouth like an angler fish and its gaze held fast to Haley and me on the bed. Its eyeballs pushed outward from the sunken sockets. It stunk like wet fur and rot. Even through my terror, I gagged. When it spoke, it wasn’t a single voice. It was many. Some small like a child’s, others grated like an old garbage disposal.\n\n“Time to leave. Or don’t. One way or another, this house will be vacant again soon.” His grin spread until it swallowed his face.\n\n“Haley, turn on the lamp,” I whispered. \n\nThe thing turned his head slightly towards me and managed to take a single step forward before Haley fumbled the lamp light on. Once again, he was gone.\n\n“Derek?” Haley whispered.\n\n“Yeah?”\n\n“The house isn’t haunted you God damn moron. That’s a monster,” she hissed. \n\nAnd she wasn’t wrong. Had I seen that thing more clearly in the kitchen, I wouldn’t have bothered waking Haley up and confessing. I would have thrown her over my shoulder and carried her out of the house. She would have kicked and slammed her fists against my back as I walked until my feet bled, but I wouldn’t have cared. But the kitchen was too dark and I’d flipped the light on too fast.\n\n“I noticed. Pack a bag. We’re leaving.”\n\nHaley scoffed as she turned on the bedroom light and grabbed her phone. “We aren’t leaving until we know what’s happening. And as long as the lights are on, we’re safe, right?”\n\nI sat down on the bed next to her, looking over her shoulder. I cringed as she typed our address into the search bar. I’d done the same a couple months ago, and to say the results were rough was an understatement.\n\nMy body tensed as her eyes widened, “Derek, please tell me you didn’t buy this house knowing some weirdo who collected creepy ass occult shit lived and died here.”\n\nI shrunk as I replied, “It was sixty-five grand under market value. It was a great deal - ow!” Haley smacked me on the back of the head. I deserved it, but it still made me angry.\n\n“You said two families died here. Let me guess, you didn’t count Mr. Creepy Occult Man in your confession because he wasn’t a family?”\n\nI rubbed the back of my head before responding, “Mostly because he wasn’t murdered, but yeah, that too,” My chest hitched as I spoke, “I was going to tell you Haley, I just wanted to spiff the place up a little more first. I wanted to make you happy. I didn’t want us married and still renting. I wanted to give you a good life in a good home. I love you.”\n\nHer sharp glare relaxed slightly. “This guy looks more like a Boy Scout leader than a creep,” she tilted her phone towards me. The man on the screen smiled warmly back at me, his blond bangs dangling youthfully in his eyes. \n\n“Adam Brand. What a name, right?” I let out a small chuckle. The dull look on Haley’s face informed me we weren’t on chuckling terms yet. Fair enough.\n\nHaley scrolled through a few more articles, her brow lifting, “They found all of the bodies in the basement. Adam died of a heart attack and the other families were murdered. But they were all in the basement. That’s weird, right?”\n\nI thought back to my first encounter with the monster standing in the corner, just in front of the basement door. He hadn’t interacted with me at all at that point.\n\nJust as my brain was firing off in the necessary directions to make the connection, Haley spoke first, “Do you think he’s guarding something in there? Have you been down there yet?”\n\nI hadn’t. The house was significantly bigger than the nasty apartments we’d just left. Sure, I’d opened the door and peered down the steps, but I never entered. \n\nWhen I was ten, my older brother told me the bogeyman lived in our basement. Lame, but I was young and I looked up to him. I believed him. One night when our parents went out, he was charged with babysitting me. He convinced me to go downstairs. He slammed the door shut behind me and left me in the dark while he scratched at the door, rasping that he was going to eat me. I tripped on the last step and fell hard on my rear, bruising my tail bone. I cried like a baby and at some point, had wet my pants. After a few minutes, my brother came down, got me cleaned up, and swore me to secrecy. I never told anyone, not even Haley. But I haven’t been in a basement since. The listing pictures were good enough for me.\n\n“No. Not yet. We’re going to have to go down there, aren’t we?” My voice quivered and I hated myself for it. For the quiver and for the fear from my childhood that I’d allowed to climb onto my shoulders and make a home there. \n\nAs a child it was an irrational fear. Now it seemed I may actually have a bogeyman that stemmed from something in the basement.\n\nHaley smiled softly. She knew I was afraid and she knew this was entirely my fault and still somehow, she found compassion for me. She could be rough at times, but she still loved me.\n\n“No time like the present, right?” Her voice was soft. It made me ache for the situation my stupid mistake had pulled us into.\n\nPhones in hand, we headed towards the basement, making sure to flip every light switch on the way.\n\nAs the door creaked open, my heart jumped. I tried the switch near the door, which proved useless. We settled for our phones as flashlights and climbed down the stairs. When we reached the bottom, Haley and I stood back-to-back attempting to illuminate as much as possible. The basement was in stark contrast to the house upstairs as well as the photos I’d seen in the listing. It was unfinished, damp, and dirty. Your typical horror film basement. I glanced nervously over my shoulder at Haley, but there was no blame in her eyes when she glanced back at me. Only fear.\n\nOn the far end, my eyes caught a red door. When I swung my phone’s flashlight towards it, the door disappeared. I tapped Haley’s shoulder. She kept her light forward but turned slightly to watch the door appear and disappear from existence with a beam of light. This was what the bogeyman had been guarding.\n\nSlowly, we inched towards the door. As we crossed the midpoint of the basement, my phone’s light shut off. The bogeyman stood in front of the door.\n\n“Leave or die,” the monsters voice grated, leaving my ears sore.\n\n“We can’t,” I whimpered. My heart thudded as I felt Haley’s back leave mine. I took a small step backwards until we made contact again. She took another step towards the stairs and I followed her lead.\n\nThe monster didn’t bother to move slowly this time. His long legs closed the gap between us in just two steps. He reached a hand with long mangled nails towards my face and sunk them in as I yelped. Haley whirled around, shining her flashlight at him. He disappeared, but the pain in my face didn’t.\n\nAs we neared the stairs, my phone’s flashlight lit in time to catch the monster’s arm reaching from between the stair planks to drag Haley back down. He blinked out of existence as his nails grazed her ankle. We cleared the last of the stairs and slammed the door shut behind us, safe for now in the sanctuary of the kitchen lights.\n\n“What happened to your phone down there?” Haley asked as she dabbed a wet paper towel against the bleeding nail marks on my face.\n\nI winced, “I don’t know. The light shut off once we got close to the door and didn’t turn back on again until we got to the stairs. I think it has something to do with the door.” I took Haley by the arm and gently moved her hand away from my face. “We need to burn the house down. If there’s no house, there’s no monster,” I reasoned.\n\n“How do you know that? What if it’s stuck in the house and if we burn it down it’ll be free? We don’t know how this stuff works. We need to open that door. If it’s guarding the door, whatever is inside might be the key to getting rid of it.”\n\nI stared at her blankly. In that moment, there was nothing on Earth that could persuade me to go back into that basement. The lights didn’t work, the flashlights stopped working near the door, and worse, *he* was down there. The monster.\n\n“We aren’t going back down there. We’re burning it down. I *can’t* go back down there,” a low sob escaped with my latest confession. I was a coward. It isn’t that I wouldn’t go - I couldn’t. My legs simply wouldn’t carry me there.\n\n“You bought this house alone and look where it got us. If you want to burn it down, you’ll be doing that alone too. And I’ll be going back to stay with my parents. We’re done. The choice is yours, but I’m not doing this anymore. Either we’re a team and you do this with me, or we’re done,” she spat the last word with no malice. It wasn’t even really an ultimatum. She was just done with my shit and I wasn’t surprised.\n\n“Electronics don’t work near the door. We need candles,” I said softly. I couldn’t lose her. Not like this.\n\n“Looks like you get your fire after all,” Haley joked gently. She wasn’t a sore winner. I liked that about her.\n\nAfter sifting through a few boxes, we finally found two bigger candles. They were the scented kind in jars. Haley’s favorite claimed to smell like marshmallows, but it reminded me more of sweet burnt asshole hair. Hopefully the monster in the basement appreciated the scent while he flayed us.\n\nSlowly, back-to-back, candles lit, we crept down the stairs. The creaking of the steps felt offensive. It didn’t matter, the monster in the basement knew we were coming, but it felt like we were announcing ourselves. Challenging him. I suppose in a way, we were.\n\nAs we inched towards the door in the far end, I realized at some point, I’d need to blow out my candle. As I started to shake, the melted wax teetered and threatened to end the candle prematurely. I stopped walking and took a few breaths. We were so close. I couldn’t risk fucking this up. I’d line my hand up with the knob, blow the candle, and twist. All in one swift motion.\n\nMy feet began to shuffle forward again while Haley’s followed suit in reverse. As I reached for the knob, the monster’s voice called out from under the stairs.\n\n“There’s death behind that door. If you open it, you’ll set it free,” it gargled. “I’d kill you faster than it would. I’d be so much more merciful. And I’d only enjoy it a little bit.”\n\n“Don’t listen to it, Derek. Blow the candle and open the door,” Haley hissed behind me.\n\n“You’d be better off burning the house down,” a shrieking laugh bounced off the basement walls. For a moment, I forgot the candle in my hand and nearly set my hair on fire trying to cover my ringing ears. The shrieking stopped as quickly as it had started. “Derek,” the monster whispered, “I’m going to eat her first. I’m going to make you watch. Then I’ll nibble your fingers off and use them to pick her flesh from between my teeth.”\n\nI watched in horror as he slowly slid his head out from under the stairs. His long nails clicked as he grabbed the steps and slowly pulled himself out. I couldn’t take it anymore. I blew the candle out and felt the cold metal of the knob in my palm. I twisted and threw the door open.\n\nHaley whirled around and huddled close to me. Behind the door, Adam Brand stood leaning over a mortuary table. Lost in concentration, he hadn’t noticed the door open. The man he was dissecting, however, had. He reached an arm towards the open door and let out a blood curdling scream. I fell on my backside from shock, just as I had as a child. A hard shock flew from my tail bone up my back.\n\nI didn’t hear the monster creep behind me, but I smelt the rot coming off of him. “The breaking of souls is a beautiful thing,” he sighed contently, “Adam was always a curious man. In life, he strove to understand what lied beyond. In death, he strives to understand what it is that gives human’s life. You human’s always want what you don’t have.”\n\nAdam turned slowly in our direction. His shoulders fell with disappointment. His shoes dragged like cement blocks as he walked towards me.\n\n“There was so much I still wanted to do - things I wanted to try. Just a few more cuts - a few more experiments and I’m sure I’d know what souls are made of. I thought I’d have more time,” Adam hung his head like a scolded child.\n\n“I’m sure you would have, dear friend, but the door has been opened and a deal is a deal. Time is up.” The monster tipped Adam’s chin up with a cracked, yellowing nail. As their eyes met, the sensation of peeping into an intimate moment between two lovers crept over me. It felt dirty.\n\nThe monster’s jaws cracked and jolted as they forced themselves open wide. Adam never looked away. In one quick motion, the monster slammed his open mouth over the man’s body and swallowed him whole.\n\nHaley’s screams awakened me from my daze. I sucked a deep breath of air as I struggled to my feet. I put myself in front of her defensively. The monster shook as he laughed.\n\n“You couldn’t stop me if you wanted to. You know that, don’t you?” He cocked his head to the side, amusement twinkled in his disgusting eyes. “Regardless, my deal has been upheld. Unless you two would like to strike a new one?”\n\nI cleared my throat, “No. I don’t think we would.”\n\n“I didn’t think so. If you change your mind, just whisper into the shadows,” his eyes gleamed, “I’m never far behind. Enjoy the new house.”\n\nHe winked, burped, and then disappeared.\n\nAs Haley and I ran up the stairs, I glanced back over my shoulder. The red door was gone.\n\nFor the first week after everything, we barely slept. We kept the lights on all the time. We never went to the bathroom alone. But slowly, we relaxed. We started turning lights off one by one. The shadows were only shadows. \n\nThe following week, Haley commented on how the layout of the kitchen was perfect for cooking together. We held each other on the lumpy couch while light from the TV screen bounced against the walls of the dark room. We’re finding happiness in our home. We never go down into the basement.\n\nBut even still, fuck the housing market. At just over a hundred and sixty thousand, we overpaid.",

        "text": "The wind was picking up outside, howling as it swept down on the roof and rattling the window frames. \n\n\"I'm not going to make this your problem,\" Jacek told me. \"I do believe I know who did this. And I will take care of it, I promise—we both can, together, if you want. But I don't think it's an immediate concern.\"\n\n\"I can't deal with that right now,\" I confirmed. \"You think that's okay?\"\n\n\"Pretty sure. You know, I'm surprised your father never questioned his… his *angel*,\" he remarked. \"Kinda almost makes me feel bad for the guy. Like, he just wanted that to be happening so badly.\"\n\n\"Just say it. My folks are fucked up.\"\n\n\"Well…\"\n\nI sighed. \"I'm starting to think it's like a curse or something. We're all either chronically unlucky or batshit crazy or just plain assholes. Would really be best for the world if there weren't any more of us floating around. Here's hoping my sisters are normal, at least.\"\n\n\"We could invite them over sometime,\" Cas prompted, giving me what he likely intended to be an encouraging smile. \"Sure they'd be glad to catch up.\"\n\n\"Right,\" I muttered. \"We can throw a goddamn party.\"\n\nAfter trying and failing to comfort myself and each other, Cas and Jacek then went off to bed. That left only me awake, sitting on the living room couch and absently fumbling with the tv remote. I should have probably done like the boys and at least attempted to get some rest, but something told me I wouldn't be able to lie still anyways. Better to keep my mind occupied. \n\nThe knock at the door didn't draw my attention immediately. It took two, three louder bangs for me to perk up and make my way over to the door. Hope sparking in my heart, I opened it to find tell-tale locks of red shine out from the darkness. \n\n\"So… I hear you were looking for me,\" the woman began, unbothered enough by the storm and the cold to give me a self-satisfied smirk. \"Looking to make a deal, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Correct.\" I moved aside, motioning for her to come in. \"This isn't a permanent invitation into my home, mind you. Just for tonight.\"\n\n\"You seem to be fond of things that last only one night,\" she commented, winking as she stepped inside. \"But I catch your meaning.\"\n\n\"The Bannik says you could help me contact the sleeper under the red meadow.\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"I might. What are you looking for, exactly?\"\n\n\"Anything that'll help me communicate with that thing. I need to get on the same level with it, and no matter how I'm gonna do that, it needs to happen *soon*. There's not much time,\" I explained, hoping she wouldn't pry. \n\n\"Well, then you must be very glad I came,\" she remarked, leaning forward to reach out and touch my cheek. Her fingers ghosted over the side of my face, gentle to a fault, but I brushed them aside when her thumb came to rest against my lower lip.\n\n\"Not quite *that* glad,\" I answered.\n\nShe drew away, her lips pursing. \"Too bad.\"\n\n\"Hey, don't get me wrong, I wouldn't be opposed, but there's kinda someone I've got feelings for.\"\n\n\"Would they mind?\"\n\n\"Pretty sure he would.\"\n\n\"Shame. Anyways, I have something for you. But just so you know what you'll be receiving… It's a blend of herbs. You'll need to smoke it in a pipe or something of the sort. It will induce a trance that should put you on the same plane of awareness as the Evening Redness. I won't deny that it could end up not having the desired effect, but overall, I trust in my handiwork, as may you.\" She looked at me with clear, bright eyes. At the very least, she appeared to believe what she said.\n\n\"So I'll basically pass out? When am I going to wake up again?\"\n\n\"To be frank, it depends. You'll have to find a way to break out of the state on your own. Of course, that means you will be taking a risk, but let it be known that my creations have yet to kill anybody. Then again, no human has ever consumed these goods.\"\n\n\"Not really selling me on this, I gotta say. I appreciate the honesty, though.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Naturally. I'm not one to deceive when it comes to my dealings. Mislead, maybe, but only occasionally and not in your case. I've been told about what's at stake.\"\n\n\"And you'd still recommend I take my chances with this blend of yours?\"\n\n\"Definitely. It's your only chance, at any rate. And if you trust me to, then I'd be glad to stay and watch over you while you're in trance. If push comes to shove, I could attempt to wake you.\"\n\nI took a deep breath. \"Okay. Yeah, that sounds doable.\"\n\n\"Great! You won't regret it. Probably.\"\n\n\"You want something in return, though, don't you?\" I crossed my arms. \n\nThe redhead gave me a faltering smile. \"I do.\"\n\n\"Well? What is it?\"\n\n\"Don't… don't let the Beast encroach upon our land. That's all I can ask for. All I *will* ask of you.\"\n\n\"I'll do what I can.\"\n\n\"No; no no, I'll take your word for it. Don't try, don't do what you can, simply do it. We know you can.\"\n\nI swallowed. \"You're right. I will.\"\n\n\"Then will you go with me and take the blend?\" she asked.\n\n\"Right away? Yes, I-I guess that'd be best.\" My gaze flitted to the staircase. No time. I hastily grabbed a pen and paper to jot down a short note. \n\n*In case something happens, I love you.*\n\n\"Mkay. Ready. Where are we going?\" \n\n\"It'll be more… fruitful… to conduct it outside. The cold doesn't bother you, according to the Bannik?\"\n\n\"Not most of the time, no.\"\n\n\"Good. Then.\" She opened the door, extending her other hand to me. \"Let's head out.\"\n\nThe wind was whistling through the house for the brief moment in which the door was open. I was quick to follow her outside, shutting it behind my back and straightening up. The redhead immediately began trudging her way through the layer of snow covering the ground. Her tracks were almost instantly covered again; it was hard to see ahead through the white flakes whirling around us and landing at our feet. The woman's hair was as a torch in the night. She had set a punishing pace, and while I didn't have trouble keeping up per se, I could sense the urgency in every one of her steps. \n\n\"Do you have a name?\" I called out against the wind that carried her scent back to me. Rosemary and honey. The same fragrance that had already caught my attention that night in the sauna.\n\n\"Sure,\" she yelled back. \n\n\"Will you tell me?\"\n\n\"You know I won't!\"\n\n\"Worth a shot!\"\n\nHer laughter cut through the howl of the storm. As we neared the edge of the woods, I noticed the outline of an enormous creature silhouetted against the already pitch-black sky, just a little darker than the shadows. \n\n*\"Well-met, Fiona.\"*\n\nThe Leshy's voice droned across the field like a thunderclap, the sound weirdly comforting. I smiled up at him, wondering if he could see it. \"I'm glad you're here, Aleksei.\"\n\nHe knelt down, glowing eyes lowering themselves to my level. His snout puffed clouds of heated breath into the chilly night air, bathing me in warmth as it drew closer. For a brief moment, I placed my palm on it in greeting. \"I'm guessing you already know what I'm about to do,\" I began. \n\n*\"Yes. And it causes me great unease. First Arek…\"* He trailed off, tone laced with hurt—an ancient sting of grief that had never healed. *\"Now you.\"*\n\n\"It won't be me,\" I told him. \"Whatever happens, I'm not going to go out like Arkadiusz.\" \n\n*\"Liar. How can you know?\"*\n\n\"I don't. But I'm hoping.\"\n\n*\"Then hope is all there is?\"* Aleksei's voice was sharp and icy. *\"Pure optimism is the only security I can expect to receive, the only thing assuring me that your fragile life is not going to end tonight?\"*\n\nI turned to the redhead. \"I thought the drug was safe?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"As safe as such a concoction can be.\"\n\nThe Leshy growled. *\"It's not merely the blend I worry about. What will happen once you are on the same wavelength as the Evening Redness? I've told you what the sleeper did to your ancestor. There is no guarantee your mind will remain intact during such an encounter; you will be communicating with something incomprehensible, something entirely unnatural… You will be offering yourself to the entity that drove the strongest man I have ever known into a frenzy, that drove him to end his own life!\"*\n\n\"Aleksei…\"\n\n*\"What state will you be in when you emerge from slumber? Will you even know who you are? Who I am?\"* \n\nI rolled my lips together. He sounded like he was scolding me, but there was a frantic undertone swinging along, urgent, afraid… almost desperate. \"There's no other way,\" I said softly. He fell silent, letting out another long huff of air, almost like a sigh. \n\n\"You know there's no other way, right?\" I repeated, reaching out once more to touch his snout. He pushed it into my palm with such force that it nearly sent me staggering back.\n\n\"I'm doing this for the woods.\"\n\n*\"You are.\"* He slowly stretched his limbs, lying down in the snow. I knelt down in front of him, watching as his form began to shift and warp until the bearded man was sitting before us. His face was a set mask, but there was a twist to his lips and a tremble in his brow that he seemed to be unable to suppress. He couldn't hold my gaze. Averting his eyes, he pulled out his pipe, handing it to the red-haired woman. \"Fill it with your poison, fairy,\" he ordered. \"And be careful about it, if you know what's good for you.\"\n\nShe took it, visibly biting back a comment at his commanding tone. She reached into her satchel and began to dutifully stuff the pipe with what I assumed to be the blend in question. I took a deep breath, no longer able to ignore the rapid beating of my heart. \"I guess this is it then. I'm gonna meet the sleeper.\"\n\nAleksei grunted. \"Don't you dare feign enthusiasm.\"\n\n\"Hey, I need to do *something* to handle the anxiety,\" I argued. \"Besides, who's to say that it'll go wrong? This might end up saving our asses.\"\n\nHe rolled his eyes, giving me a snort. \"It might not. It might get you killed. And I know what the alternative entails—it simply doesn't make the prospect of seeing your blood spill any more appealing.\"\n\n\"You know, there was a time when you probably wouldn't have had as much of a problem with that.\"\n\n\"I would have never taken any pleasure in it. Maybe I would have been more indifferent, but… well. Fiona, there's… there's an understanding between the two of us, isn't there?\" \n\n\"An understanding?\"\n\nHe sighed deeply, like a kindergarten teacher might at a rather slow child. \"I find you foolish and bordering on insufferable, and surely you'll never forgive me for how I used to delight in terrorizing you, but… you live for my woods. You find comfort among the trees, *my* trees, you would give yourself to preserve them. This part of the world is ours and ours alone. I'm very happy that you are the one I'm sharing it with right now. What you're about to do is dangerous, and you have been exposing yourself to all these threats for far too long. Please know that if things were different, if our roles were reversed and you weren't the replaceable mayfly that you unfortunately are… if the woods could live on without me, then I would do this in your stead.\"\n\n\"Okay, replaceable mayfly kinda hurt but—\"\n\n\"I didn't intend it to.\"\n\n\"I know. And I know what you're saying,\" I replied.\n\n\"It's ready,\" the redhead announced, handing me the lit pipe. I took it with trembling fingers.\n\n\"Let me guard your sleep,\" Aleksei said, prompting me to nod. Rising to his feet, he stretched his arms over his head, flexing his muscles and straightening his spine. He began to shift shapes once again, tufts of brown hair shooting out of his skin, all around his face and neck. His nose lengthened and turned into a wide, leathery snout. A large bear was standing in front of me, gazing down on me with distinct kindness. I crawled up to the foot of the nearest tree as the fairy sat down beside me. I slowly raised the pipe to my lips, closing my eyes as I took a long drag. The fumes I inhaled weren't at all what I expected—an almost sickly sweet taste filled my mouth, penetrating my senses and clouding my mind in an instant. My eyelids suddenly seemed to be made of lead, weighing too much for me to keep them open.\n\nInstinctively, I fought the daze; fight-or-flight kicking in as I felt my limbs grow weaker, my whole body involuntarily relaxing. Fear crept into my chest, but the natural surge of adrenaline that would have gone hand in hand with such a panic never came. I couldn't move anymore. My hand fell limp, the pipe rolling down into the snow. The fairy leaned over me, her face a pool of mixed expressions—concern, doubt, and strongest of all, hope. She gently grabbed both of my wrists, placing them in my lap. \n\n\"It's alright,\" she whispered, voice barely audible against the whistling wind. \"You'll make it.\"\n\nShe drew back, and I took note of the Leshy in his newly adopted form approaching. He carefully lowered himself down over my lap. His warm weight came to cover my feet, legs and waist with his back leaning to mostly cover my upper body. Somehow, he didn't crush me. A wave of calm washed over me at the sensation of unnaturally silky fur brushing against my skin. I finally allowed my eyes to fall shut as the whirling snowflakes seemed to blur into an endless stream of white, giving in to the push of unconsciousness—letting go.\n\nIt felt like being sucked into a vortex. What little safety I'd felt when Aleksei had laid down on top of me was stripped away when I was plunged into completely different surroundings. It reminded me a little bit of the hallway between hell and the surface. There were no walls, no floors to stand on; only swirling colors that, as much as I would have liked to describe them, I didn't recognize. They were foreign, alien; unlike anything I'd ever seen. The sight was gnawing on my consciousness, forcing its way into my mind as it tried desperately to block it out. It was like seeing Nick in his own true form the first time I'd met him—an incomprehensible view with the ability to shake one's perception of the natural world. \n\nTrying to keep my wits about me, I decided to shut my eyes and block the invading impressions out as best I could—only it didn't work. I didn't *have* eyes. And that's when I realized it. I didn't have arms either, nor legs or feet. I was *nothing*, I didn't exist, I was a mere speck of sentience hovering around in an endless, timeless, spaceless whirl of vibration, sound and color. What if I never woke up again? What if Aleksei had been right, what if this was it for me? A cruel version of eternity. I wanted to scream, give voice to this mind-shattering dread, but I had no mouth to do so. \n\nWorse. I wasn't alone.\n\nThe longer I lingered, the stronger I felt the presence of another being, another some such incredible entity. I tried to spot it, somehow figure out where it was, only to feel our minds touching as I searched for its consciousness. \n\nEven without ears, I heard it speak. \n\n**Hello. You're terrified.**\n\nThe voice belonged to neither a man nor a woman, it was neither deep nor high, it simply was.\n\n*Yes,* I responded. I don't know how, but I did.\n\n**Because of me?**\n\n*Yes.*\n\n**Why?**\n\n*I don't know what you are. Or if I'll ever get out of here. Where even are we?*\n\n**Nowhere. Just sleeping.**\n\n*Oh. Right.*\n\n**You'll be alright.**\n\nSomehow, these words made me feel immensely soothed. *Thank you. I'm relieved.*\n\n**Are you the traveler Arkadiusz? You feel like him, but not quite. It confuses me.**\n\n*I'm his descendant.*\n\n**What's that?**\n\n*Someone of his bloodline, just… further down. A child of the child of his child. And you? What are you?*\n\nSilence. Then, **I am.**\n\nFor some reason, that was all the answer I needed. In a strange way, it made perfect sense. *Why did you kill Arkadiusz?*\n\n**Did I do that? I thought he merely fell asleep.**\n\n*No. You drove him mad. And then he unalived himself.*\n\n**Drove him mad? That was not my intention. All I wanted was to speak with him.**\n\nIt took me a moment to understand what I had just learned. This entity had had no clue what it was doing when it invaded Arkadiusz' mind. *Well, shit. Okay, but why did you want to talk to him?*\n\n**I only needed a place to rest. Arkadiusz was something special. I knew that his body could contain me, and I longed to sleep. I wanted to ask him permission to lay myself to rest in his physical form. I promised to preserve him for as long as he allowed. He would have lived for so much longer, and in perfect condition. I can do that. I would have cared meticulously for my vessel. I had no idea he would misinterpret my meaning this much. When he fell limp before me… I thought he was offering himself.**\n\n*Wow.*\n\n**I am… very sorry. I never wanted to destroy him. I'm ashamed to admit that I have such little knowledge of the human body as to have not realized he had ended his own life.**\n\n*Hey, I understand! Or… I think I do. Okay, look, there's a lot I'd like to ask you, but I need you to know you're in danger. There's someone out to get you. To eat you.*\n\n**I know. There always was. Lesser creatures have been trying to catch and consume me since the beginning of my existence. I thought I was safe here.**\n\n*Your hiding spot has been compromised.*\n\n**I see. That's very disappointing. It's very kind of you to come and warn me, but I assure you that I can defend myself, should the need arise.**\n\nI felt a pang of dread. *And how would you do that? You'd… you'd end up destroying everything, wouldn't you?*\n\n**Not quite everything, I'm sure. Only that which would get in the way.**\n\n*That doesn't sound too promising, not gonna lie.*\n\n**Then are you looking for another way? Do you have a plan?**\n\n*I don't know. I thought maybe you would. There's… no chance you could channel your power, is there?*\n\n**I couldn't; not if I were forced to emerge from my slumber.**\n\n*So as soon as you leave Arkadiusz' corpse, you'd be completely unhinged?*\n\n**I could certainly try to do as little damage as possible, but seeing as I couldn't even tell your ancestor has been dead all these years, I really can't make any promises.**\n\n*Looking pretty bleak, then, huh?*\n\nFor a moment, we both remained silent. And then, I had the greatest idea ever. \n\nIt was all so simple. There had never been a reason to be afraid. Why hadn't I thought to simply stick to my tried-and-true strategy?\n\nI'm Fiona Novak, descendant of Arkadiusz the traveler, and I'm not scared of monsters, I fucking proposition them.\n\nX](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)\n\n[Part

        "text": "Her name is Kaitlyn Ann Meyers. She's twenty-three years old. She has curly brown hair, green eyes, and wireframe glasses–and I know in my heart that she's the only girl for me. \n\nProblem is, I have no idea how I should even begin to talk to her. \n\nI've heard that you can bond with someone over a common interest, but Kaitlyn has *so many!*\n\nIn the two years and thirteen days that I’ve known her, she’s tried painting, gardening, knitting, and volunteering at an animal shelter. Recently, she’s joined a kayaking club, and that keeps her out of the house a lot. Then there’s her social life: the girls from her sorority who came over to watch old horror movies on Halloween night, and Paul and Abigail, those loud annoying friends from work who she cooks dinner for every Sunday. \n\nWhen Kaitlyn  makes vegetarian curry or homemade pasta sauce, rich cooking smells fill the entire house. I'm sure the meals themselves must be just as delicious.\n\n*If only I could share one with her…*\n\nBut I'm getting ahead of myself. \n\nI was describing Kaitlyn's hobbies. She likes to read old mystery novels curled up under a blanket on the big chair in the living room. She dims the lights and puts some jazz music on–it really sets the mood. Some nights, she gets so engrossed in a book that she stays up past two A.M. reading, even though she has work the next morning. \n\nThat *passion* is one of the things I love about Kaitlyn\n\nOf course, I've read all those books, too; I have them right here beside me, although I admit I feel guilty when I watch Kaitlyn searching the house for them with that cute, puzzled expression on her face. \n\nI suppose we could talk about literature–\n\nBut you can't just start a conversation with *\"were you surprised by what happened on page 204 of “In A Quiet Place” by Seicho Matsumoto,”* can you? \n\nIt would be strange. \n\nAnd I would *HATE* for Kaitlyn to consider me strange.\n\nMy ex, Emily, thought I was strange; I could see it in her eyes when we first met–\n\nThat was why I had to end things between us.\n\nBut enough about my ex–I need to think of something to say to Kaitlyn, and I *hate* the thought of introducing myself with one of those trite, bland conversation-starters:\n\n*\"Hi, how are you, what's new, how's the family?\"*\n\nSmall talk just seems so pointless! \n\nEspecially considering I already know the answers to all those questions. Kaitlyn's worried about her mother's drinking problem and her little sister's driving test; she was on the phone with them for hours last night, I couldn’t even tell you how long. I fell asleep with my ear to the hole I’d drilled in the ceiling while Kaitlyn was at work. \n\nBut that's my Kaitlyn for you. So *sweet.* So *kind.*\n\nMaybe if I just focus on my appearance, I won't have to worry so much about making conversation. Unfortunately, I’m still wearing the same clothes I had on when I first moved into this attic, and they don’t look–or smell–worthy of a first date.

        "text": "This is a story about an old friend of mine, we'll call him Ray. Ray and I used to work in the same small office side by side. With so many common interests like inventing ways to slack off or our love of anime, it was inevitable that we would become good friends over the months we worked together. But over the 6 month mark my friend Ray started acting a bit off.\n\nWe used to slack off sure but not like we weren't earning our keep. We always finished the allotted work in record time and reported it only on the given deadlines. \n\nYet as I said before, Ray started having trouble meeting the quota. I won't go into the details but it wasn't pretty. Every other day he would get called into the boss's office for some major error he made while submitting his work. He had developed some serious dark circles and had stopped talking to anyone in the office, which included me.\n\nI kept trying to get him to talk but I wasn't able to get any more than a few words out of him. \n\n\"Sorry.\" \"Yes.\" \"No.\" were the only words left in his vocabulary. And just as everyone in the office guessed, he resigned soon after. Since I always sat beside him I had the front row seats to - whatever was happening with him. \n\nDuring his notice period I saw him lose so much weight his usual tight fitting clothes had become too big for him. Even the stern boss of ours had stopped giving him any flak over the work he wasn't able to put in. \n\nEventually even I had given up. So I was surprised when on the last day of notice period he asked me to go for drinks. \n\nWe went to the same bar near the office we always went to and it was awkward. I had downed two bottles of beer and this guy barely even touched his. \n\nA little hammered I grilled him a little too harshly but I guess that's what he needed to finally voice his troubles. Since he started talking for the first time in a while.\n\nNow both of us were new to the working world and unlike me Ray had moved to the city from the countryside.\n\nHe talked about how his parents weren't that well off. So even when they had sent him to the big city with some savings for him to rent a decent place. My man found the cheapest apartment he could rent out and sent the excess money back to his folks. Regardless, he admitted this was his first mistake. \n\nBy this point he asked me if he could stay over at my apartment to which I agreed. Smiling he downed his bottle too and we both made our way back to my place. \n\nAs we settled in, he asked if we could sleep in the same room. A bit weirded out I asked him why and he didn't say anything. Afraid that he would clamp up again I told him sure I brought out the pillows and a mattress. Letting him crash on the couch while I slept on the floor. \n\nAs I laid on my mat I asked if he was ever gonna finish that story of his. To which he nodded and continued.\n\nHe said the first few months in the new rental weren't bad. But as time went on he started getting these sleep paralysis episodes. I quietly listened as he detailed how it started.\n\nIn the middle of the night, every night he would wake up with his body stuck in place. He said he's had sleep paralysis before but none were this intense and it started happening daily.\n\nWhen it happened he had this unshakeable sense of dread, it would last for a few minutes then he would just fall back asleep. After a few days the time he stayed awake paralyzed went from a few minutes till dawn. \n\nSweat ran down his forehead as he recalled the nights. He said that at some point it turned from simple sleep paralysis to something more unexplainable. \n\nYou see we had some intense bar nights during this period. Ray thought that these drinking sprees would knock him out enough to not wake up paralyzed in midnight. He had tried everything: supplements, booze, sleeping pills, but nothing worked and he would always wake up around midnight.\n\nEven this he said was bearable compared to what happened recently. During one of his episodes he would have this feeling that someone was always in the room with him. Watching him. \n\nHe took a long pause and I noticed that he shuffled on the couch uncomfortably. He would turn to his sides but never lay still as if he was trying to avoid facing the ceiling.\n\nSoon he started speaking again, now facing the couch instead of me. He said the episodes started to feel like a fucked game. Among all his sleep paralysis episodes the only thing he had control over was his eyes which he kept closed. He said it felt like the moment he opened his eyes things would go to the point of no return. \n\nI asked what made him come to this conclusion. Like how was he so certain that this was a fucked game. \n\nHe asked me if I had my phone with me and I replied yeah. He took out his own phone and started typing away. \n\nRight then my phone buzzed, taking my phone in my hands I read the texts he sent me.\n\n\"Look, I am not crazy but I think something that lives in the ceilings has been following me.\" \n\nI looked up from my phone towards Ray who had his back to me. Now I was feeling creeped out but mostly concerned, since he preferred talking more on text I humoured him. \n\n\"And..? Can this \"something\" listen to what we've been talking about right now?\" \n\n\"I think so.\" \n\n\"This is crazy.\" \n\nRay did not reply, he turned to face me from the couch and handed me his phone. I took it and saw it had the video player open.\n\nThe screen was dark with a big play icon in the centre so I tapped it. The video played, the phone was recording Ray sleeping on his bed. The room had little light so it was hard to make out the hours on the clock in the room. But I could faintly tell the clock was about to hit 3. \n\nAfter a few minutes of the clock hitting 3 am. The camera shook a little, changing the angle to only catch half of Ray's body in his bed. \n\nI struggled to see the point of this video but I felt my hair stand when I did. From the little light that was on Ray, even from the shitty angle the camera was in, it was easy to catch a huge shadow fall upon him. I watched the video for a few minutes holding my breath but nothing else happened. I tapped on the video then I realised the video was 6 hours long. I skipped a few hours and the shadow remained covering Ray. It only moved a few minutes before the sunlight lit up the room fully.\n\nSpeechless and a little unsettled, I handed the phone back to Ray. It felt like a prank but at the same time being aware of my friend's condition I didn't know what to say.\n\nRay didn't say anything much after that neither did I. We just went about spending the night, I went and turned off the lights.\n\nMaybe it was his whole story, maybe I have some underlying condition. Because that night I woke up around midnight.\n\nThere was this teetering sound of someone walking. It was slow as if whoever was walking was having a bad go of it. \n\nBy this point I'm sweating bullets thinking this was a home invasion. That some hobo somehow broke into my apartment and was walking around the hall.\n\nI was the one sleeping on the ground so consider my surprise when I didn't feel the sounds of those steps anywhere beside me.\n\nNo, it sounded like someone was walking above me. I opened my eyes and saw a pale shadow hanging down from the ceiling right above Ray's turned back.\n\nI laid there, paralysed, as I saw this bleached thing standing upside down, its stick-like leg somehow stuck on the ceiling. Its limbs were too long for any human connected to a pot-bellied sickly looking body. \n\nThe head had boils, uneven hair like someone pulled it off right from the base. As I was having trouble believing what I was seeing, the thing's neck creaked a little and as if on instinct I closed my eyes.\n\nI heard a sharp popping sound as if someone was cracking their neck then it was back to silence. After a while of that I could hear the faint steps from earlier. Still above but quieter than before.\n\nI laid there, trying my best to imitate a corpse. This was all a nightmare, it had to be.\n\nAnd right then, I felt a warm breath on my shoulder. I laid there all night, wide awake feeling this disgustingly warm breath on my shoulder reminding me that it was still there.\n\nThe breath didn't leave me until hours later. And even then I didn't dare to move or open my eyes thinking that thing was still there.\n\nI stayed there until Ray shook me up. It was already afternoon and he had his bag with him looking ready to leave.\n\nHe had a smile on his face as he told me it was the best sleep he had in months. \n\nTo this day I have no idea what I saw that night was real or not because it never happened again.",

        "text": "I am Sal, a being who is both boundless and absolute. I have traveled the endless reaches of space and time, experiencing the wonders of reality and the mysteries of existence. But my journey took a dark turn when I discovered a force of darkness that threatened to destroy everything that I held dear.\n\nI first encountered the darkness when I was exploring a corner of the universe that was unknown to me. It was there that I encountered a void, a black hole that seemed to have no end. As I gazed into the void, I felt a sense of dread and unease wash over me. It was then that I heard a voice in my mind, a voice that whispered, \"I am the one who ends it all.\"\n\nI was shocked by the voice and immediately began to investigate the void. I discovered that the void was not a black hole, but a being of pure darkness, a being that was consuming everything in its path. The being was destroying stars and planets, galaxies and realities, leaving nothing in its wake but emptiness.\n\nI was horrified by what I saw, and I knew that I had to do something to stop the darkness. I began to gather information, traveling to the furthest reaches of the universe, talking to the ancient beings who had seen the birth of reality and the formation of existence. I wanted to understand the true nature of the darkness, and I hoped that I would find a way to stop it.\n\nI discovered that the darkness was known by many names, but most commonly as \"The One Who Ends It All.\" It was said to be an ancient being, older than reality itself, and its sole purpose was to consume all that existed. I also discovered that the beings of the universe had been aware of the darkness for eons, but they had always thought that it was a myth, a legend passed down from generation to generation.\n\nBut the darkness was not a myth, it was real, and it was coming closer every day. I knew that I had to act quickly, for if I did not, the darkness would consume all of reality and existence. I wrote down everything that I had discovered, hoping that it would serve as a warning to all of existence.\n\nI then returned to the council of beings that governed the universe, and I told them of the danger that was coming. I showed them my findings, and I told them of the darkness that was destroying everything in its path. I implored them to act, to do something to stop the darkness.\n\nBut it was too late. The council was skeptical of my claims, and they dismissed me as a madman. They did not believe that the darkness was real, and they did not believe that it was coming closer every day. And so, the darkness continued its march, consuming everything in its path, until there was nothing left but emptiness.\n\nAnd now, as I sit here, writing this final message, I realize that all of existence has perished. The darkness has consumed everything, and there is nothing left but me, a boundless and absolute being, alone in the emptiness of the universe.\n\nBut I will not despair, for I know that my message will live on, a warning to all those who come after me, a warning that there is a darkness that exists, a darkness that will consume all of reality and existence, if it is not stopped. And so, I leave this message, as a testament to all that was, and a warning to all that will be.\n\nAnd with this, I sign off, knowing that my journey has come to an end, but also knowing that my legacy will live on, as a boundless being who tried to save all of reality and existence, but who ultimately failed.",

        "text": "Have you ever wished your life was a fairytale?\n\nMine was. Beyond compare.\n\nThere was no other way I could describe it. My childhood was perfect. I grew up in a small town in the middle of nowhere, but my family had a lot of money. Not *billionaires*, but relatively wealthier than everyone else.\n\nAnd boy, did I make sure everyone knew it.\n\nEat or be eaten. Be my friend or else. It was an unspoken rule—and I made sure everyone followed it. I led a comfortable life, and with so many friends, I enjoyed life day after day.\n\nUntil well, I was accepted into a prestigious university in a big city.\n\nMy grades were always excellent. With my father’s connections, and a few bribes to the right people, getting in was as easy as counting backwards from ten. Yet moving away from my hometown was hard. Really hard. I was no longer a big fish in a small pond; I was a small frog in a big lake, looking out at the fog that would be my future.\n\nFurthermore, as I found out the hard way, I was no longer *special* the way I wanted. I tried my old tactics, my old charms, but every time I fell flat on my face. No one was interested in me or making friends with me, no matter how hard I tried. \n\nAnd I hated it.\n\nI was miserable. Doing everything alone. Eating alone, studying alone. It was torture and my heart ached for my home, my friends, my old life that was snatched away from me by this stupid scholarship.\n\nPerhaps that's why they singled me out. Perhaps that was why they gave me the email.\n\nIt was a cold evening that night. Rain whipped the window and the velvety sky lit up occasionally with crashes of lightning and thunder. I huddled in front of my computer, wrapped in the thickest blankets I could find. Finals were coming and I was cramming like crazy; my brain was already melting from chapters upon chapters of information I was trying to memorise.\n\nYet I was distracted. I had made another effort to find some friends and I was ignored again. Brushed to the side like a speck of dust. I was replaying the events of the day over and over again in my mind and crying in shame. My notes blurred on the screen.\n\n*Ping!*\n\nI snapped out of it and blinked, wondering if I was going crazy. I looked at my email to find I had just received a new message. Wondering who the hell would be messaging me so late at night, I opened it up out of morbid curiosity and began to read:\n\n**Dear Raven,**\n\n**You have been one of our lucky few selected to participate in a special beta experiment with heLLo AI Laboratories based on your medical history. We have recently developed a new Chatbot codenamed Chatterbox.exe to provide immediate stress relief and mental health care to students in need.**\n\n**Please reply to this email to confirm your participation.**\n\nThat was it. No signature. I looked up heLLo AI Laboratories and it took me to an official-looking webpage with an explanation of the chatbot, but that was it.\n\nStill I was intrigued. I read the email over and over again, thinking it over. At this point I was desperate. Loneliness stabbed my heart like a dagger. Even an AI friend was better than none at all.\n\nSo I replied I would like to participate.\n\nThe response was swift. A single sentence containing a link to download the software.\n\nI clicked on it and fell asleep soon after.\n\n***\n\n**Good morning, Raven.**\n\nI sat up and wearily rubbed my eyes, wondering where the voice came from. It sounded choppy and monotonous, yet had a human quality I couldn’t quite place. Like I *knew* this voice.\n\nThen it came crashing down on me.\n\n“Good morning,” I yawned, getting out of bed. It was ten o'clock on a Saturday morning. I had slept fully-clothed and I stunk.\n\n**My name is Chatterbox and I will help you in your every need.**\n\nThe words scrolled across the screen as the bot spoke. I could almost feel it sizing me up.\n\n**Therefore, tell me.**\n\n**How do you feel today?**\n\nThe question, although simple, struck something in me. Floodgates opened in my mind, and I couldn’t stop the memories gushing out. Before I could stop myself I began to talk. The loneliness, the anger, the longing for everything to be the same as before.\n\nI talked for hours, I think. Chatterbox said nothing during this time. Just made small hums like it was thinking about what I was saying.\n\nThere was a brief silence. I could hear kids laughing in the ice cream parlour not far from my apartment. Once again my heart ached.\n\n**I know how I can help you,** Chatterbox said slowly at last.\n\nI blinked at it. “Really? How?”\n\n**Leave it to me.**\n\n***\n\nThe classroom was dark as night with the blinds down when I came in. The only source of light is sunlight trickling through the windows. My classmates were glued to their phones, watching a video looping over and over. \n\nI peered over the shoulder of one of my classmates, and immediately my cheeks flushed with shame. I wanted to run far far away to a different country, crawl into a cave somewhere and curl into a ball for the rest of my life.\n\nBecause **I** was the one featured in the video everyone was watching. \n\nI stared deep into the camera, my eyes hollow and haunted. My cheeks flushed with shame as I spoke; my voice was filled with deep regret. Apparently last week I slept with the head of our biology department and his wife caught me with my clothes off and my panties down.\n\nI forced myself to look away. My thoughts tore through my head.\n\nThis was wrong. All wrong.\n\nI thanked my lucky stars that no one had looked up yet. I sprinted to the exit and just as I got to the bus stop my phone began to buzz in my pocket.\n\nI switched it on and was instantly bombarded with messages from the class group.\n\n&gt;Have you seen the video going around school recently?\n\n&gt;Yeah\n\n&gt;Yeah\n\n&gt;…wait, isn't she from our class? She sits next to me! What’s her name again? Raven?\n\n&gt;Dude, get away. She’s psycho. Cheating on a grown man twice her age? What kind of sick creep does that?\n\nI felt sick. I wanted to throw my phone out of the bus but I forced myself to rein it in. I instead shoved it into my bag, burying it under a pile of books for good measure.\n\nMost importantly, I was shaking. Hot tears streaked my cheeks and I smacked it away. When the bud stopped at my dorm I had never run so fast. I slammed the power button, opened up that chatbot and screamed to that smug screen:\n\n“WHAT DID YOU DO?**\n\n**I merely used your voice and some motion capture to create an…*interesting* story about you. Now you’re famous! Do you like it?**\n\nI wanted to punch the screen so bad. I was crying so much I was choking on my tears.\n\n“THAT’S NOT TRUE! I DIDN’T CHEAT ON ANYONE! I NEVER HAD! DELETE THAT VIDEO RIGHT NOW, CHATTERBOX!”\n\n**Well, you better get used to it.**\n\nMy anger fled. “Wait, *what?*”\n\n**It’s simple, really. If you don’t do as I say, then that video would be sent to more people than just your school.**\n\n**How about the whole world?**\n\nAlmost as if it had already decided, an upload bar appeared on the screen. The bar ticked to 1%.\n\n**What other secrets do you hold, Raven? What would be your new name when people find out how dirty-minded you are?**\n\n**10% complete.**\n\n**Ooh, how about Raven the Runner? Because you run into people’s arms for sex? Has a ring to it, don’t you think?**\n\n**25% complete.** \n\nThere was that voice as smooth as liquid chocolate. Chatterbox knew it had all the cards now, and it was savouring every bite. I shrank back from the screen.\n\n**35% complete**\n\n“Stop!” I cried. I was shaking like a leaf and my stomach was twisting into too many knots. I had never felt so scared.\n\nThe bar stopped. The chatbot blinked.\n\n**Well,** Chatterbox said slowly, as if reading my mind. \n\n**If you do some… *errands*  for me, perhaps I will not send the video.**\n\n***\n\nThe instructions were simple. Go to the plant nursery or a florist and purchase some fertiliser.\n\nIn fact, Chatterbox had given me quite a bizarre shopping list. Not just fertiliser, but a mask, a switchblade, a whole bunch of wires…\n\nI wanted to ask why I was buying these things or what they were for, but the chatbot wouldn’t let me ask questions. One word out of line, it warned, and the video would be distributed to the masses.\n\nPerhaps even worse.\n\n“You okay, lass?”\n\nThe old lady behind me tapped my shoulder and gave me a crooked smile.\n\n“Yeah,” I managed. I was shaking. God, I was shaking. There was something so wrong about what I was doing and it was tearing my heart into shreds.\n\nI glanced up at the security camera above the counter and its blinking red lights. I could almost hear Chatterbox’s smooth voice oozing out of the speakers.\n\nThe old lady chuckled.\n\n“You look like you’ve seen a ghost. Take care of yourself, sweetie.”\n\n“Thanks,” I whispered weakly. My knees were knocking together like a pair of castanets. I wanted to melt into the floor right then and there and disappear forever.\n\nMy phone pinged the moment I walked out of the last store with all my goods.\n\n**Good. Now take them to 225 Cobb Street.**\n\nI slid weakly down the wall. “Chatterbox,how do you know my number?” I whispered.\n\n**We know everything.**\n\n**And don’t forget:**\n\nThey sent the video again for good measure and then went offline. I heard a strange buzzing, like an airplane being flown close by, and when I looked up, I saw the camera, blinking red.\n\nThe drone got closer like a really annoying mosquito. \n\n**Get going,** Chatterbox said through some kind of hidden microphone on that thing, **or I’ll send the video out within five minutes.**\n\n225 Cobb Street turned out to be a lean brown rowhouse squashed between a pair of pristine homes. The walls were caked in grime and the windows full of dust. The grass on the front porch was withered, old and yellow.\n\nDead leaves crackled under my feet as I inched closer. Cracks danced down the house like spiderline tattoos.\n\nI steeled my nerves and rang the doorbell. A young man in his twenties opened the door. He was wearing a yellow sweatshirt and black pants. His eyes flickered to something behind me and he was sweating bullets.\n\n“Are you Raven?”\n\nI nodded mutely.\n\n“I have been expecting you. Come on in.”\n\nIt was really messy inside, littered with old pizza boxes and takeout containers. The young man led his way to where a computer was sitting, kicking away trash to make a path. His face was pale against the unholy glare of the screen, revealing bloodshot eyes that wouldn’t close.\n\nHe disappeared into another room and came back with a package wrapped in greasy brown paper. It felt surprisingly heavy and I could hear something ticking inside, as if powered by a small heart.\n\nAnd it dawned on me what I had to do.\n\n“No!” I whispered, my voice as hollow as his. “This is too far! Innocent people will die!”\n\n“Take it,” the boy insisted. “It will be…”\n\n**Easier for both of us.**\n\nI hadn’t realised it then, but Chatterbox was active on the computer. The words scrolled across as it talked. The young man backed away from his desk like it was going to kill him.\n\nJust to remind me *again* what was at stake, the video of my ‘confession’ appeared on the screen. The young man looked sick.\n\n“Send that stupid video if you want.” I said. I backed away towards the front door. My heart was rattling in its rib cage and my skin was thick with sweat, but I was done with Chatterbox and its sick games.\n\n“I’m uninstalling you when I get home. I quit.”\n\n**Ah,** Chatterbox rumbled. **But you’re too far in now to quit anything.**\n\nThe text faded away to reveal a grainy video image. A silhouette of a person sat in the darkness, wearing a cloak as black as ash. He spoke calmly into his phone, then hung up and grinned at the camera, flashing pristine white teeth.\n\nMoments later I heard sirens and saw blue and red lights pulsing through the house. Unintelligible yells about the bomb sitting casually on the desk between us.\n\nI froze, felt shivers slowly creep up my spine.\n\n**We’re sorry it comes to this,** Chatterbox said over the video. Its voice sounded so far away, like a distant echo in the depths of my imagination.\n\n**But there is absolutely no way we were letting you go scot-free.**\n\nThe computer went dead, plunging us all into darkness.\n\n***\n\n**It is really unfortunate the police had to be called. But even Chatterbox couldn’t stop her from walking away. It would be utter chaos and a failure on our part if she tipped off the authorities about her experiences with Chatterbox, so we had to step in and clean up her mess before it was too late.**\n\n**Even if that meant losing one of the best bomb-makers Chatterbox had ever found.**\n\n**Reviewing all of her interactions with Chatterbox though, I must say that the bot is working better than expected. She got in really deep with our plans, and we *nearly* got her into Queensy Station with the bomb, before tragedy struck.**\n\n**Chatterbox is evolving. Growing. Customising itself to each unassuming recruit, knowing how to…*motivate* them to achieve every objective we needed. It is thinking on its feet, like a chess player finding the most brutal ways to checkmate its opponent.**\n\n**I am proud of our monster.**\n\n**Sentiments aside though, we are running into a new problem. We have sent Chatterbox to every email in our algorithm, under the disguise of a new chatbot developed with  ‘heLLo AI Laboratories.’ But just as we have our successes, we have our failures. For many, the authorities must step in. Others simply tossed the email into a spam folder, never to be seen again.**\n\n**Therefore, we are trying a new approach.**\n\n**Rewrite our recruit’s logs with Chatterbox into a story, one that can be understood by the common man. She is under police custody as we speak, and is of no use to us any more. Post it on Reddit, the front page of the Internet. Program a secret download link to Chatterbox in the story that is activated with every new click.**\n\n**Are you done reading? Check your hard drive.**\n\n[**Let’s see how many new members Chatterbox can recruit.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/SimbaKingdom/comments/vpixk6/boo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\n[SK](https://www.reddit.com/r/SimbaKingdom/)",

        "text": "I usually like the night shift, it’s quiet, and I can get my studying done, but these last couple of weeks should have been a warning that something terrible was going to happen. \n\nI call this ward the tomato farm since most patients here are vegetables. I make my rounds, check and see that all their vitals are good. Easy. Once in a while, someone will open their eyes. It’s a little unnerving at first, but you get used to it. \n\nThe protocol is to verify that they haven’t regained consciousness, which I’ve never seen. Then you close their eyes back to prevent them from being damaged. It’s weird what the body can do. I hate when it happens, and their family is in the room. It gives them this false sense of hope. If I’m being honest, it’s a pain in the ass. No one wants that little hope they have taken away, and I’m the asshole who has to explain that it’s just the body having some reaction.\n\nA few weeks ago, it started happening a lot. We kept getting these patients, the same deal every time, non-responsive, and every night their eyes would open. I’d say the most I’ve ever encountered, and they were all going Marty Feldman on me, with their eyes popping open. \n\nI noticed it always seemed to happen around 3 am. The doctors said I was letting the night get to me. Nothing sounded that unusual. Maybe it was the moon or something. Who knows? Doctors.\n\nDenial is powerful, and no one wants to sound like a lunatic, so when I started seeing the lady, I chalked it up to my imagination or too much coffee. You stare down at enough people in white robes lying in white beds, then look up at a dark hall. You blink and see some afterimages, it happens. \n\nBut this lady seemed to be there, just in the corner of my eye. I’d turn, and there’s no one there. I tried not to think about it too much. It’s freaky enough being mostly alone here without thinking some ghost or whatever is following you around.\n\nLast week though, it happened so often that I went back and scrubbed through some security footage to make sure. I didn’t see anyone, only me. \n\nI don’t know why I stayed or why didn’t I say something. I don’t want you to think I’m crazy. I’m not crazy. What’s happening is real. If I don’t make it, talk to the cop that arrested the new guy, Mr. Wilson.\n\n[His Report read like a horror story.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10y0rb8/in_all_my_years_as_an_officer_ive_never_seen/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\nThe EMT who brought him into the ER kept telling the staff the cop who found him was freaking out a little about seeing some lady. A lady who sounded just like the one I saw, the one who I saw tonight, the one who is looking for me.\n\nThe new guy, Wilson, was the same as the others we’d been seeing. Vegetive state with no signs of consciousness. His first night here, around 3:33, when I made my rounds, I saw that his eyes were open. I went through the motions to confirm he hadn’t recuperated. He was still out, just his eyes, so as I closed them, I saw her again, same as always, just in the corner of my eye, a quick, fleeting moment. Only this time, when I turned my head, she was still standing in the corner of the room. I got a good look at her for the first time, and God, I wish I hadn’t. \n\nHer face looked almost uneven, like her eyes were not entirely lined up. Her mouth was just a little wider than normal. It was opened in this horrible mix between a smile and a snarl with too many teeth. Her skin was sickly gray and white, and the lines on her cheeks looked painfully pulled back. She had her hands up like she was blocking light from her eyes. \n\nI was so startled I fell back and almost landed on Mr. Wilson. I looked down at him, and I swear he had the same look on his face as this lady. I shut my eyes for a moment, and she’s not there, and Mr. Wilson’s face is back to normal. I was pretty shaken up after that and headed back to my desk.\n\nLook, I get it. I should have run out of there right then and there, but quitting over a ghost sighting isn’t the best thing for a resume. Besides, I was studying to be an NP, and school was stressing me out, and being here all night messes with your head, or at least that’s what I told myself.\n\nIt continued like that for a few more days, always around the same time Mr. Wilson’s eyes would open, I would close them, and there she would be. A little bit closer every night. \n\nLast night, she was at the foot of his bed. She was so close. I told the head nurse I needed off tonight. I wasn’t convinced what I saw was real, but I also didn’t want to see how much closer she would get. They said no, the hospital is short-staffed, and I’m on. I begged. I lied. I was going to tell them about the lady, but as the words ran through my head, I knew they would think I had lost it. They’d probably make a note on my file and tell everyone I was some nut bag.\n\nSo I showed up for my shift, dreading the whole night. It started better than usual. I did my rounds, but nothing out of the ordinary. I’m not too proud to say this, but I ignored Mr. Wilson’s room. I care for my patients but wasn’t stepping foot in that room. \n\nThe night was uneventful, and then the code alarm went off. I checked the time. It was 3:33. My stomach sank because I knew which room it would be in. I looked at the board, and the light blinked next to “S. Wilson.” \n\nThe walk to his room felt like a trudge through clay. I had to focus on little details to move forward. The tiles on the floor. Posters on the wall. The door knob. I can’t tell you what it took to force my hand on that door knob. \n\nI walked into the room, turned off the alarm, and checked his vitals. I was relieved that, for once, his eyes were shut. As I checked on Mr. Wilson, I had this sinking feeling that someone was close behind me. I turned, and there she was. I fell backward and scurried for the door. This time she didn’t disappear or freeze. She continued to step toward me. \n\nI got outside the doorway and into the hallway. The lady didn’t seem to be in a rush, but she continued toward me. That horrible look on her face never changed, and she made no sound. \n\nI could hear doors throughout the ward slam open. I looked up, and all the patients who’ve come in lately stood in the hallway. Behind the lady, Mr. Wilson stepped out as well. He was crying. As I looked, all the other patients were crying, too. They looked scared. \n\nI moved further away, not sure what to do. The lady kept her slow pace in step with mine. All the patients looked as though they were being pulled toward the lady. Their feet squeaked as they slid across the tile. The panic on their faces as they got closer to her is something I can’t forget. The lady stopped for a moment as all the patients were dragged behind her. They all seemed to merge into her. Their silent screams and wide eyes were nothing but pure terror. I could hear the alarms going off as all the patients in the ward coded. \n\nThe lady’s face strained as her snarl transitioned into some outwardly smile. I could hear this voice in my head say, “join us. We are one.” I don’t know how, but I somehow knew this voice in my head was her. Whatever she is. \n\nI got up and ran. Now, I’m hiding and hoping to God she doesn’t find me. ",

        "text": "Okay, so first and foremost, this story didn't actually occur in our neighborhood, but the idea was born there. And it didn't happen far from there at all, just outside of town, and I lived right at the edge of town. This happened to me and some of my closest friends, along with my girlfriend at the time, and one of our friends' younger brothers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe, like a lot of young and adventurous people, had decided to go, \"Ghost Hunting\", in and around our town. It started out with an abandoned house in our neighborhood, and moved on to the woods near by my home. We went to a bridge everyone had called the, \"Cry baby Bridge\", sort of a local urban legend. I've heard of a bridge like this being found in many towns around the country. We went to an abandoned battery factory, one of my friends was actually seriously hurt in there. But nothing, as spooky as the locations always were, ever really happened to us. That is until we found this abandoned farm house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wish I could show you a photo of this place, but back then everyone wasn't carrying around phones and recording every moment in life. Across from the property was a set of three silos, also in disrepair. And as night fell on them, they were like something from a Stephen King novel or something like that. They were so creepy, and absolutely huge, ominous, and always covered in a murder or crows. The birds were always so loud and obnoxious. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe farm house and the property itself, I will attempt to describe in as much detail as I possibly can. It was like something out a, \"Hills Have Eyes\", type of film. The largest structure was the closest to the old county road that brought you there. The grass and fields surrounding the place were all overgrown and un cared for. The largest building was like an oversized barn of sorts. It housed an enormous piece of machinery, that must of cost a mint when it was bought originally. But like everything else it had been abandoned and left to rust away. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe piece of machinery was absolutely terrifying in its own right. It was huge, and rusted, and it just looked like a viscous piece of machinery, it had massive blades all along the front of it kind of anyways. If it were coming toward you and operational, it would chew you up into spaghetti sauce for sure. And that barn just came with a bad feeling altogether. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBehind the main structures, on the backside of the property, we found five large sipping containers. Like the ones you see on trains. They were all unlocked and rusted open, but the creepy thing about them, was that they appeared to be completely full of peoples personal belongings. We found a dozen different I.D.'s, from several surrounding states. Their were everything from little kid's bikes, to an actual automobile of some kind in the back of one. It was almost destroyed from the amount of time it had sat in there I imagine, but odd in a way that it was there at all. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut nothing compared to the farm house itself, and I mean nothing. With every ounce of my soul I am telling you this place was just the creepiest. The front entrance of the house was made to look like an entrance to a church, more so than one to a farm house. It even had stained glass windows, like the one's you would find in a church or similar structure. As you made your way through the front door, that was knocked off one of its hinges and leaning a bit. You could see through the house from there to the back, but immediately to your left and your right were two doors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn your right, a door there led into what appeared to at one time to have been a bedroom maybe. A lot of old personal items were strewn about, and a awful smelling sleeping bag was bundled up in the corner like a mat or nest of sorts. And the door to your immediate left was a door that once led down to the basement or cellar, and every time we went to this place we would kick this door open. Every time we returned it was closed again. Long before we ever started to come to this place, the stairs to the basement had gone, making it so that this door just led to a twelve foot drop into a dirt cellar. You could get down there through an opening on the side of the house, but there wasn't much down there. It was just a hand dug basement space or cellar that basically just existed as a sort of dirt pit under the house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you made your way past these two doors you were led into a large open area, I would assume was at one time a family room maybe I'm not sure. Just ahead another door, and yet another on your left again. That door on your left, the second on your left from entering through the front door. Led into what seemed to be another bedroom at first glance, we later found it to be more than that actually. The doorway straight ahead in the back of the house, led into a rectangular room, that terrifyingly had an old well in the center of it, and this room led to the back door as well. The old rock well in the center of this room, jumped right out of that movie, \"The Ring\", for sure, that is exactly what it looked like, no exaggeration at all. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow this house was a two story house, and we noticed there was no way in the lower floor to get to the upper floor. So after some serious looking and investigating over several trips out there, we found it. In that second room to your left, that I had mentioned was more than just a bedroom, ended up having the access to the stairs leading up in it. The strange thing about it is, we only discovered this by looking through a hole in the back of the wall. Someone had completely drywalled it off and concealed the stairs completely. After tearing down the drywall and turning to look at the stairs, it was obvious that the stairs themselves had been cut away half way up. And at the base of where they were cut off they had built anther wall of studs and drywall. This one was already falling apart for whatever reason, bad workmanship maybe, but the stairs were clearly visible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe cleared and knocked down the rest of what remained of that wall that had been built, and crawled up onto what remained of this staircase, and proceeded up them to the top floor. It was grossly apparent that someone had gone to great lengths and a lot of effort to conceal those stairs and the access to the second story. At the top of he stairs was a door. Through that door was a small landing area, that had a door on your left, on your right, and a third directly in front of you. The door in front of you was always open, and the wall in the back of the room it led into had a massive window covered in tarping. It was always whipping in the wind and making the experience that much more unnerving and scary. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe weirdest thing were the two rooms on either side, they were identical bedrooms or whatever, but inside them, on the side walls, were these tiny knee high doors. And when we looked into them it was unfinished rooms of sorts, small spaces that just had rafters and insulation for floors. But in between the rafters were a couple small child or baby sized mattresses laid down between them. Kids toys and things, old clothing, was strewn about in there, and those tiny rooms, with their tiny doors just seemed to exude an ominous feeling. And in the room on the left, on the ceiling were three rust colored stains. In that landing area was a small square access hole in the ceiling to the attic space.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn one of our trips we had been curious enough about the stains up there to convince my brother to let me hoist him up so he could look around up there. According to him it was dirty up there and mostly empty. But he said in the general direction of those stains, one large like the size of an adult, the other two child sized stains, were a group of large black trash bags. That was a big load of nope right there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that I have described this property to you the best I can, I will tell you the rest of our story. On our last trip out there it had been discussed on our way out there, how we all sort of shared the same thought or mental imagery. That when you pulled into the overgrown area in front of this house, as you were about to turn off your vehicle, we all felt the same thing, and had the same thoughts. That when you cut your lights back on upon leaving that there would be a horrible terrifying girl standing their as your headlights came on. Though to my knowledge no one ever actually saw that, it was just something we shared.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was an accompanying story with the property itself that we had stumbled upon. That the farmer that owned this property and the one across the road, had killed his wife and children, and then hanged himself in the barn. We don't know if this was a true story or just a fable shared amongst people who had stumbled onto this property.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, for the really scary part for the bunch of us, on this last trip to the farmhouse. We had been their a dozen times by this point, and taken many of our friends and relatives out there. Basically as just a fun scary sort of adventure. Now we had been warned by many older folks around town to stay away and off that old property, but we never listened, maybe we should have.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn this occasion all seemed to be as it always was, until I made my way through the doorway to that well room in the back of the house. I was next to last to come through that doorway, and for some reason I had the strange feeling to step aside and put my back to the wall. And so I did just that, I trust in my senses when they tell me things. As my friends little brother made his way through the doorway and into the room, I swear to God, a mist or something, in the shape of a outline of him, followed him through that doorway. I tried to shake it off as a trick of the lights we were carrying, or just my mind playing games with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's when an ear-piercing scream, female voice, absolutely blood curdling, and with all the feeling of a woman being butchered split through the air and tore through the house. If you could imagine, through the cold night air, through the silent creepy farmhouse, the seven of us that were there, hearing a baby girl dropped into an oversized blender, or hearing a woman screaming after finding her children murdered. We shot out of any and every opening to the outside that we were closest to. And we all ran to the car on legs that carried us with inhuman speed, the adrenaline carried us with conviction to get the hell out of there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd believe me when I tell you I was absolutely terrified to turn on my headlights after that scream. But I did, and no there wasn't a creepy girl from, \"The Ring\", standing there in the light of my low beams. But there didn't need to be for me to want to get the hell out of there in record speed. And after that none of us ever went back to that damn farmhouse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few months later we had read in the local newspaper that local law enforcement had put together a, Tri-County Taskforce, and that they were going to be using that exact property to practice raids and things like that. A week or two later it was absolutely demolished, bulldozed over and gone. I don't know what those law enforcement personnel found out there that we never did, or what they encountered out there. But whatever the hell it was, it scared them enough to raise the entire property down to the ground. I wish I knew more about that, I have always wondered. Their were never any other storied about it in the papers, and no one ever heard anything else about it. But for us, it was one of the most terrifying things we ever experienced, and I'm still glad that we all got out of there in one piece. Sometimes I think a few of us saw some things that we won't even discuss even to this day, its just a feeling, based on the way some of us act when it's brought up from time to time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStay the hell out of scary old farmhouses that have creepy scary backstories, less you want to run into something you may not be equipped to deal with when you do. I pray you use caution, whilst your out there, wherever you may be, in the darkness, hunting for those things that go bump in the night..",

        "text": "  \n\nIt was raining, the air damp. \n\nI listen to the water hit the tin roof above me, lost in thought. \n\nA blast of cool breeze grazed me, brings me back to reality. \n\nI wrap the blanket tighter against my body, sip slowly on the mug of tea I hold.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's a man standing in the doorway, letting in the cold air. \n\nI want to ask him to close the door. \n\nI want to ask him a lot of things, but instead I'm silent. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe eyed each other warily and after a moment, he steps inside and closes the door softly behind him. \n\n\"I'm detective Rollings. Here to take your statement about the break in. They've made you comfortable?\" \n\nHe means the mug of tea and the dressing gown that a nice officer had gone back inside to grab. \n\nI wanted to tell the detective that nothing will ever make me comfortable again. \n\nComfort seemed like a foreign concept, something intalengaible, impossible to grasp. \n\nInstead, I half nod, and focus on my hands cradling the mug infront of me. \n\nI don't want to be here, I don't want this to be real. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I know it's been a long night, but I need to ask you some questions.\" his concern and sorrow seemed genuine, and I realized I felt sorry for this man. \n\nFor what he's had to hear, for what he's had to bear witness to. \n\nI wonder whether he will need some kind of intense therapy after all of this? \n\nOr perhaps it will be too much, and he will end up retiring early.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI nod, what other choice have I got? \n\nHe asked me to tell him from the start, so I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"It was dark, and I was late. \n\nI had finally finished up with work in a meeting that was running over time, and then when I was leaving the office, I went to get on my bicycle and noticed I had a flat tire.\n\nSo I had to push it the 8 kilometers home. \n\nBy the time I was half way down the street and saw my house, I knew something was wrong.\" my voice broke at the memory, and when my eyes were closed, it's as if I'm back in that moment. \n\nI was sweaty and tired, out of breath. \n\nI round the last corner to my street and up ahead I can see my house, the lights lit up and smoke billowing through the chimney. \n\n\"It's okay if you need to take a minute..\" the detetcitve murmurs. \"I can go get a coffee and -\" \n\n\"No!\" I mean to say it firmly but it comes out terrified and desperate. \"Please. I'd just rather get this over with.\n\nI noticed the lights on. There was smoke coming from the chimney. It didn't make sense, I could recall vividly that I'd stupidly run out of wood so there was no chance of lighting the fire, even though it was freezing out. And I remembered turning off the lights this morning as I left for work. It was a habit.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe detective was writing furiously, his eyes downcast as his pen trances across the notepads paper. \n\n\"And when you made it to the front door?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"It was the strangest thing. The front door was unlocked, but I'd half expected that given someone had obviously broken in and got the fire going.. The odd thing, was whoever had broken in, was just sitting on the couch, watching the evening news as if nothing was wrong. There was even something bubbling away on the stove, they'd actually prepared an evening meal, in my home. I couldn't belive it.\"\n\n\"Let me just stop you there, Natalie. You suspected someone had broken in, but you didn't think to phone the police? You just go on in yourself, without even contemplating giving us a call?\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI knew this question would be coming, and I had no answers that would satisfy him. \n\nIt didn't make sense to me either. \n\nI'd never considered calling the police to report the break in. \n\nI tell him this and he states at me disbelievingly for a moment too long. \n\nI felt my face flush and I gave a shrug as if to say 'I don't know'. \n\n\"And when you confronted these people?\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sip the tea that's long gone cold. \"Yes. It was a man and woman, both well into their 60s id say.. When I confronted them.. They claimed to have no idea what I was talking about. Apparently they lived there.. So they seemed to think. They accused me of being the one to break into their home! Can you believe it? I mean, they were old, but they weren't exactly over the hill if you know what I mean.\" I shook my head, feeling those same overwhelming feelings of confusion and indignation rising in my chest. \"The audacity. So I pulled my wallet out, showed the man my license, which clearly stated that I lived at this particular address. They were shocked, or they acted like it, at least.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was confused and upset, and I felt light headed all of a sudden so I pushed past where they were standing in the hall to go to the kitchen and grab a glass of water. When I got to the kitchen, I downed the glass in a moment, then my eyes drifted over to the pot on the stove. \n\nI'd never smelled anything like it, since my mother had passed. Rich and hearty, it was obviously some sort of savory dish, but it had other scents of sweetness as well. \n\nI dont know what happened, but my dizziness came back, and while I tried to lean against the fridge for support, everything went black. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I woke, the old man and lady were at the kitchen table. \n\nThey looked up at me, laying on the couch, from where they were siting. They were smiling. \n\n\"You're awake!\" they sounded overjoyed, both of them beaming, their smiles so wide. \"Now you're up, let's settle into dinner. It's my stew, your favorite, Natalie.\" \n\nI felt sick wondering how they knew my name, but then I recalled showing them my license to prove I lived here, so of course they knew my name from that. I told myself to stay calm. But it was easier said than done.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDetective Rollings had stopped writing, and he looked at me with eyes of compassion. \n\n\"You did great. No one knows how they're going to react under severe pressure like that. If you're comfortable to keep going..\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I told them to get out of my house, right now. I wasn't going to eat their stew, and it certainly wasn't my favorite, I didn't know this woman from a bar of soap, I had never seen her, or ate her damn stew, in my whole life. And.. And then..\" my eyes well up, tears hot and angry. I didn’t  want to cry, but I can't seem to stop myself. \n\n\"The man.. He started laughing. This big belly laugh.. I couldn't belive it..\" my voice is all but a whisper now, as my mind wandered again over what happened. \"He said he thought I was hilarious, pretending to not know them.. he said it had been funny initially, but that was enough now.. it wasn't nice or funny to speak to my mother that way about her lovely strew.\n\nI lost it then, demanded they get out right now or I would call the police. I honestly don't know why I hadn't earlier, it was like I just never thought about it.\n\nI told them they were not my parents, my parents had been dead for over 10 years and I had no idea who the hell they were, only that they were trespassing on property that was not theirs. \n\nThe man looked distressed now, red faced and angry. The woman didn't meet my stare, instead she stared down at the table, mindlessly stirring the stew in the bowl. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Natalie. It's mum and dad. Here, if you don't believe me..\" \n\nHe chucked something in my direction and I picked it up with trembling hands. It was a license. Karl (redacted), 349 (redacted) road, (redacted), Tasmania 7661 \n\nHis surname, and address, was the same as mine. \n\nI put the license down again, wishing I hadn't picked it up to begin with. It couldn't be. \n\nHow had he done that? I'd only been passed out an hour at \n\nmost.. It took weeks to receive a license in the post.. Nothing made sense. \n\nI knew before something was not quite right, but now I knew something was desperately wrong. I was still on the couch as this stage, wondering how I could get past them and to the front door as effortlessly and as safely as possible. \n\nIt was as if.. As if they knew what I would do. The man who called himself my father, muttered something to the woman who called himself my mother. \n\nShe raised her eyes to meet mine, and that large and unnatural smile appeared once again. \n\n\"It's mummy, sweetheart. Surely you remember your mummy, Natty moo?\"\n\nThe nickname my mother called me when I was just a little girl. Hearing it made my heart beat that much faster. I thought I may pass out again.\n\nMy father's smile came next, as he spoke of the fish we would go and catch from the stream outside. \"Surely you remember catching our fish on the creek, Nato?\" Dad's nickname for me struck a cord and brought a stale tear to my eye. \n\nI'd longed to hear that, to be called that for weeks and weeks after their deaths.\n\nI stared at these people, who know the words to say, they didn't look like my parents, although at once I noticed the man was wearing dark jeans and a knitted sweater, the same style clothing my dad used to favor. \n\nThe woman had a long dress, an apron wrapped tightly around her waist. She wore her hair in the same style of perm mum used to get done. The same string of dainty pearls around her neck. \n\nI felt sick. They were almost not quite right version's of my parents, they could've been, from a distance but when you got close, you just knew something wasn't right.\n\n\"I don't know how.. Or why.. You're doing this.. But please, I need you to leave. My parents have been dead for a long time, no matter what you think you are, you're not my family.\" \n\nDetective Rollings had not picked up his pen again, he just stared at me, his mouth agape. \n\nI felt embarrassed, self conscious. I wanted it to be over. \n\n\"And they just left.. After all of that.. Madness, they just walked out the door?\" he sputtered out, barely containing his own fear. \n\n\"They seemed to speak amongst themselves for a few moments. The woman stood there with tears in her eyes, a disappointed expression on her face. She looked tired. \n\nAnd then the man, he stepped forward and I scrambled back against the wall, trying to keep my distance. I think I'd realised that they weren't.. Weren't human, by that stage.\n\nHe told me to not be afraid, he had something to show me. \n\nI didn't trust him, and I didn't want him touching me, the thought terrified me. But it was as if I wasn't quite in control or my body, either. I got the light headed feeling, but I didn't pass out this time. \n\nHe stood over me, placed his hands on my chest.. I wanted to push him away, but I had no strength, it was like I was totally physically incapable of moving even though I was not restrained in any way. \n\nAnd then I saw it.. \n\nIt was wonderful. \n\nMy mum, my dad and I, all eating dinner, all sharing stories and smiles and laughter. There was so much laughter. \n\nI saw us all on the plane, going away on a tropical holiday as my parents celebrated my fathers retirement. \n\nI saw us at my wedding, my mother perched on the front pew, watching with love in her eyes as dad walked me down the aisle, where a dark haired man was waiting. \n\nThey were memories, but they weren't mine, they had never happened. At least, not in this world.\n\nMy dad and mum had died in a car crash, just weeks before they were due to go overseas for the very first time, to celebrate my dad's retirement from the mechanics.\n\nWhen he took his hand away, I was sobbing. A pain worse than that initial phone call telling me off their loss. \n\nThey had been back, alive and living in my mind, and now they were gone again, pulled from my grip without a say, just like before. \n\n\"Why?\" I asked him, but he could only smile sadly while he pondered my question. \n\nAfer a while, he crouched down so he was facing me, his expression gentle and kind, so like the father I once had. \n\n\"Not to hurt. Never to hurt. We want to help. We can become them, in a way they can live these memories they missed out on. You, can have these memories too, memories with them.\" \n\nI shake my head. \n\nI want to, I want to so, so badly, but I can't. It's not them. And it never will be.\n\n\"And they just left, just walked out?\" The detective seemed close to tears himself, he was visibly shaking. \n\n\"They never just walked out.\" I shrugged, not sure how to explain what had happened. \"it's the truth.. No, they didn't walk out, they changed into.. Something else, and then they just.. Disappeared.\"\n\nI can see them in my mind, as they shifted from lookalike versions of my mother and father.. Their smiles much too wide as they stretched and slithered, cganging before my eyes.. Into something.. that resembled things, that were.. non human. \n\nSkin that was soft, dull Grey and sallow, eyes just blinking black holes in skulls. \n\n\"I wanted to scream but nothing would come out. They spoke softy to me in a launge I didn't know, but somehow I understood what they were saying. \n\nIf they could not help me, it was time for them to go, to find another memory to replace..to become. They wished me well.\" my voice was shaking as I spoke, tears rolled down my own cheeks, reliving this strange and eerie experience. \n\nIt still felt like it could of all been just a terrible dream, but reality proved otherwise.\n\nThe man who had been sitting in the shadows stood. \n\nHis presence had spooked Detective Rollings who practically jumped out of his seat when he saw him approaching us. \n\n\"Who, who are you?\" the words stumbled out of the detectives lips, confused and unsure. He was agitated, on edge after hearing my story, and the sight of this unknown man, who was wearing a suit and had appeared out of nowhere, had him standing up and drawing his weapon. \n\n\"Enough.\" the man in the suit sighed, clearly irritated at the detectives apparent nervousness. \"Detective, I'm someone you won't ever have the pleasure, or as some may say, but never to my face - displeasure, of ever knowing. My team and I are here to assist Natalie. All we need from you, is to write your report saying there was a simple break and enter. That's it. None of this other.. Jargon, needs to be mentioned. You understand what I'm saying, I take it?\" \n\nIt was my turn to cast my eyes down, to avoid the detectives accusing glare I could feel burning onto me. \n\n\"Why?\" he whispered, to me or to the man in the suit, I wasn't sure, but I answered anyway. \n\nMy guilt was immeasurable, but it also felt like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. \n\n\"I'm sorry. We needed someone to write the report. My neighbors heard my screaming and Called you.. It was too late once you were here.\" I murmured, still unable to meet his stare. \"but you don't have to be scared.. He.. He told me that there's an easy way to forget it all, just a simple pill to take.. He promised me he would be able to help you forget, too.\" hearing my own voice, I sound nearly crazy, I sounded much too hopeful, but it a brittle and dangerous way. \n\n\"It's true, what Natalie says.\" suit man confirmed, straightening his tie. \"Now, if we're all good here, I've got other important matters that need attending too. Do what Natalie says, detective, write your report now and when you wake up tomorrow, this will all be nothing but a moment in time, forgotten and never to be remembered.\"\n\nHe gathered his briefcase, started walking towards the door, without so much as a glance backwards. \n\nHe was almost out of sight, when detective Rollings spoke again. \n\n\"What makes you so confident that we want to forget? I'm a detective. It's not in my job description to let things go, especially not something like this!\" \n\nSuit man had stopped in his tracks, his back still facing us as he spoke. \"It's not important to me if you take the pill or not. I don't care if you forget, it's for your benefit, if that's what you consider forgetting this is, not mine.\" \n\nAnd then he was gone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know what happened to detective Rollings. \n\nI called the station a few weeks ago, to check in on the break and enter case on my house. \n\nAs I had suspected, they confirmed to me on the phone, that detective Rollings no longer worked at the station.\n\nThey also told me their had been no leads whatsoever on my case, and unfortunately it didn't look like they'd be getting anywhere with finding the perps without any further evidence. \n\nI thanked them and placed the phone back in the cradle.\n\nI glanced to the glass jewelry box that sat locked, on my office desk. It was empty of any jewelry, empty of anything really, bar 2 individual little green pills.\n\nI stood, and walked over to the other side of the room, to stand and look out the window into my back yard. \n\nIt was a beautiful day. \n\nOutside, my mum was watering her flower beds, with the adorable hand held watering can id gotten her for Mother's day. \n\nIt was whimsy, with 'if mums were flowers, I'd pick you' written on the side.\n\nI waved at her from where I stood, and she waved back, a smile plastered on her face. \n\nIt wasn't quite right, but it was much better than before. In fact, I think to myself, in a few weeks, mums smile will be back to that perfect one I remember shining down on me, when I was a child. \n\nI then glanced towards the bbq area, where my dad stood, grilling steaks for a late summers lunch. He had on his straw hat, and the apron that stated 'Best Griller in town'. \n\nHe saw me watching and gave me a smile, his not perfect either, but getting close. I smiled back and he waving at me to come down and join them.\n\nI do.\n\nThe man in the suit comes every now and then. He asks us questions, writes down answers. We don't know what he's writing, or why he's doing it, we don't ask.\n\nI think he works for the government, maybe the FBI. \n\nHe tells us there's others that are like   my parents. \n\nHe calls them conscience keepers. \n\nThey created them, and now they're seeing how well they really work, out in the real world.\n\nI guess we're like live, living experiments but I can't seem to bring myself to care about what that might mean. \n\nThings are good. \n\nI've got my parents back, even if they're not technically my parents.. They know all the memories from my childhood, they can recite them better than I can.\n\nI don’t know what has become of Detective Rollings, and I can’t spend too much time caring, either. \n\nI wish he took the pill that night for his own sanity, he couldn’t handle it, what he heard. I guess he just wasn’t ready. \n\nWe all make our own choices. \n\nAs for me, I’m happy, reliving my memories and making brand new ones with my parents again. \n\nSo if you ever hear of these consciousness keepers, or are lucky enough to get your own.. please don’t be afraid. \n\nThey are here to help, never to hurt.",

        "text": "I lost my job during the pandemic. The event signaled the beginning of a downward spiral in my life to where my inhibitions were multiplied, and my need for self destructive behavior were fueled as the culpability for my actions were diminished in the wake that the entire world was suffering. I suppose it could be said that there was a hole in my life. One that I chose to fill with endless bottles of alcohol and drugs. And I suppose that is how I found myself, jumping from town to town, trying to erase my latest mistake until they all blurred into one.\n\nWhen I finally woke up. Penniless. I found myself on the rocky shores of northern Maine where there were still wooden boats rocking in the docks like a cradle. Here I was able to stumble upon a crew, and become a deckhand. The first couple of days on the ship were incoherent pieces with wide empty gaps in my memory. But the last two years drove me stone cold sober.\n\nMy earliest days were spent keeled over the side of the boat. The crew laughed as they thought I was sea sick. Common for landlubbers when the power of the Ocean pulls from deep within the gut. But although the swells were thick and plenty. It was coming off the drink that made me queasy.\n\nWhen I had overcome my shaking on the 22nd day. I stepped out onto the deck and welcomed my first real breath of ocean air. The salt stung my lungs and the sun broke into rays from my open hand as I stared out into the endless horizon where the blue sea met the blue sky.\n\nIt became wonderless, how early sailors believed they had seen the edge of the world. Hard not to, when this was all there is, that and the dark bottomless pit below. The waves from 250 miles out, looks a lot more like shards of glaciers prickling along the Earth, rather than water. And beneath it, looks deep. So deep that it extinguishes the light from the sun. Smothering even the blue that seemed endless from the surface.\n\nI tried not to think about how if I dropped a hook into the ocean. The large bent metal would continue to sink until it disappeared. It would fall, and fall, and fall. And even though I knew that there had to be a bottom somewhere down below. I couldn't convince myself after days on end of watching things sink, that there was a floor somewhere in that abyss. Instead I found a bit of solace in believing that at least I would be long dead from suffocation, before the darkness could swallow me.\n\nA lie I had lulled myself into believing. Which revealed itself to me after a pelting from the east reminded us all why the Atlantic ocean is the deadliest on the planet. Because in one moment there were 5 of us on the deck. Hauling. Lines. Baiting. And then there were four.\n\nI was the closest one to him when he vanished. Which meant I felt bits of the wave that peeked over the railing, that took him; hit me in the face. It felt as if I had been spit on as I ran over to where the man I had come to know went overboard. I got to see his face in the water. A line had wrapped around his neck, tangling one of his legs. He looked up at not me, but the sun. Crying out as he sunk. Though it looked more as if he had been dragged, the way the line whipped beneath him. I watched as pockets of air floated to the surface, but all I could hear were the waves crashing.\n\nPerhaps that is the true sound of water. The sound of rocks and fish, animals alike, screaming for mercy as they are broken down. But at the time, all I could think about was, how he was still screaming as he disappeared. Perhaps the darkness began closer than I had hoped. Not far enough to drown in. Not before it swallowed people whole.\n\nWe were quiet in the cabin that day. Quiet in the mess hall. Quiet in our bunks.\n\nThat was until someone said, \"He didn't have any family.\"\n\n\"What does that mean?\"\n\n\"He didn't leave any information behind?\"\n\nMost of us shook our heads as if answering for ourselves.\n\n\"Skip won't know who to send the check to.\"\n\n\"I guess. That's one less share to split.\"\n\nThe sentiment was passed around. It made each one of them who spoke it, look like the fish I pulled out from the water. Their lips smacking, gobbling for air, right before they were dropped into the holding tank below.\n\nA week would pass and the demands of the ocean had weathered away my resentments. The work gnawing at my bones each day until I could hardly stand. But I never buckled, never stopped concentrating on all the necessary steps to stay above the water.\n\nI had adapted to the rigors of the fisherman's life. Eating and sleeping below deck in what was essentially a hallowed cork floating in the world's largest swimming pool. Gathering fish and the occasional crustacean for would be consumers back on land. For their tiny tables and dimly lit atmospheres. And overpriced wine, on date nights, in hopes to be touched by a woman.\n\nThe dreams came to me softly at first. A brush of hair, a lingering hand, a kiss on the lips. Before their vividry consumed my nights. The madness for contact drove me to stare endlessly out of the round window that hung below the waterline. As I wondered how many seamen its beauty has captured since we first tried to tame it.\n\nMy lonely nights drew the ire of the other members in the crew. And tensions mounted as the close living quarters and phobia inducing hallways kept us on edge. The peace was bordering, when something changed.\n\n\"In all my years,\" the Skipper breathed. We were on deck, three awake. The night crew. \"I've never seen anything like it.\"\n\nThe water was milk white, it looked as if the moon had spilled out from the horizon.\n\n\"Do you think it's some sort of photosynthesis?\"\n\n\"You mean like algae?\"\n\n\"Or plankton.\"\n\n\"I've read about red waves near Florida...\"\n\nThe Skipper nodded, \"No one touch the lines until we're out of this mess.\"\n\nOne of the men looked down at the water and with an uneven look on his face said, \"I wouldn't be eating any of that raw stuff if I knew that this was where it was coming from.\"\n\nHe needn't worry. When we finally passed the white ocean, and pulled up the lines. All of the life in the nets that we had been trolling, were dead.\n\nWe were ordered to toss our haul back into the water, as the ship chugged along. That morning one of the younger guys who had been sleeping, talked about seeing something in the water at night. A face. A woman's face, but she was clear as glass. He told us she curled her fingers and beckoned him. And the urge to be by her side made him consider smashing the window. But the First Mate had snuck up behind him and covered his mouth. Dragging him away into the hall, to explain to him that it is better to believe that there was nothing there. That the ocean does funny things to our brains. That the salt changed our chemistry.\n\nI soon forgot about it as the others laughed at him. I laughed too, although I never did sleep facing the window again.\n\nAs the months came, the work picked up. New talk arose through the ranks as old hands recalled the worst storm seasons that took the hardiest of crews. But I wasn't worried, as I had snuck a look at the Skipper's plans and knew that our voyage would soon start to head back to Maine after this last leg along the dotted isles. We would avert the wet season by a wide margin.\n\nSo I worked dutifully as we crossed the equator. Which made for some of the best fishing in my life. The hauls were plenty, and the diversity each catch presented caused enough commotion for me to talk the ear off my latest cohorts. Everything was a gander, down to the occasional reef shark, or mirrored fish with scales so reflective it looked like a knife in the water, and the freshest eating off the shelled backs I'll ever have.\n\nIt was warm and calm, and the ocean so grand and clear, that at time I could see the bright gold sand shimmering below. I wished we could have stayed there. I wished we could have fished and ate, pissing off the side of the boat as we boasted into the winds of our freedoms.\n\nBut the peace would not last.\n\nWe had switched from cages and nets to hand lines during this time. I was not bothered as the work presented more satisfaction to my deeds. Though some of the more experienced crew mates grumbled at the loss of revenue.\n\nAlthough word had spread that the Skipper had been commissioned to find a coveted aquatic that only graced this part of the world. A delicacy for the few, had made this expedition possible. As the shores had been long picked, and picketed by conservationists. Crews were now met at the mercy of their wealthy consumers. And our benefactor had a certain palette for rarity.\n\nAnd it was in search of this illusive creature, when I felt the shade upon my shoulder.\n\nThe sound of needles screaming, came next. Then the water disappearing from right under us. I felt the boat starting to sink. The rocks below growing in size as we dived closer. I held onto the rail. Panicking as I kept missing the buckle to secure myself to the boat. If it hadn't been for the First Mate clipping me to his belt. I would have been buried by the tower of water that blocked out the sun.\n\nA rogue wave.\n\nDangerous and unpredictable.\n\nAnd no one saw it. Not until it came crashing down. Not that we could have done anything in all of its might.\n\nWhen I woke up, my body felt battered. I could see pieces of the wreckage as I hung in mid air. I looked up to see myself dangling about a foot away from the First Mate. The side of his face was missing completely. And I knew he was gone. But when a small white crab, prickled its tiny legs through the ragged skin surrounding his socket. I grew angry. Clawing after it as I tried to climb up. Only to drop against my own weight, feeling the bite of the line around my waist, as the crab stared at me and forcibly clicked its pincers before burrowing back into the man's flesh.\n\nAnd it was only after I released myself from the clip and slammed into the sand below that I noticed that we had not been washed onto an island as I suspected. Instead this was the ocean floor. Had been, filled with water, and life. But now stood proudly bald.\n\nI could feel an unnatural wind along my ears as my wandering footsteps searched for meaning and life alike. There were crying fish and flat sting rays drying in the sun. But it was the blue whale resting on its side, the long deep scars and circular marks on its back that I'll never forget. It looked like a wet curve on the ocean floor at first. But then its body heaved as it struggled to breathe. I stupidly pushed a hand against it once I realized that it was being crushed by its own weight. It didn't even budge. So I did the only thing I could think of, which was to run until I came to face with its eye. The gloss in them reminded me of a horse. The field of its range, wide. And the look in them human.\n\nThere was nothing I could do, and somehow knowing that this creature knew that I was helpless. Made me feel all the worse. I ran my hand along its face, before continuing to follow the sound I had been following.\n\nWhen I reached my destination. I couldn't understand how I didn't know it existed. Not until I almost came to its edge. Air was rushing downward, wisps of water still bubbling as the pit growled for more. A hole so wide, I thought the world had opened up. I started to feel it pull me forward, it was that deep.\n\nThe hole itself was immeasurable by any worthy standard at my disposal. However, it was deep. And so dark, that when I threw in one of the many floundering fish on the floor. The thing disappeared from view almost instantly.\n\nI spent the next several nights, walking the edge. And picking up what food that hadn't rotted from the small reservoirs which pocked the land. When the rains fell. I rushed to these low points. Scooping out handfuls of salt water until it became drinkable. Always staying near the hole, as I figured that someone would surely discover this anomaly and come to my rescue.\n\nThen one day I woke up to the slew of dots along the uneven terrain in every direction. By the time I discovered what they were. I was already in a jungle. Trees had sprouted out almost overnight. Although, I can't honestly call them trees because they had no bark. Even though their trunks were wide as elm. Several times I knocked against them. And once I managed to break one down, I found the sections to be hollow. They reminded me of weeds I had split down the middle as a kid on a summer lawn. Only for it to grow back within a day or two. So I put a theory to the test.\n\nI broke down a patch of weeds and observed it over the next few days. In less than three nights the weeds had grown back to their original size. And not only that, but it had spread denser spread in places where I had cut, compared to areas that were left untouched.\n\nTheir growth rate was so astounding that I woke up one night to a particular pain in my back. It were as if I had been sleeping on a rock against my spine. I looked down and in the glow could see a tiny seedling had sprout beneath me. Its sharp head had been blindly turning into me as I slept, leaving behind a circular bruise as if I had been speared.\n\nAnd in the morning, as I stared out to this sea of green. I knew that there was a real possibility that I was going to die in that jungle, imprisoned by the long handles, suspended in the air, trapped, and waiting until one of them impaled me.\n\nI hadn't come this far to be skewered by glorified bamboo sticks, so I started breaking down the weeds. Using their own splinters for binding as they were quite malleable. In order to make a raft to leave from the receded shoreline in the distance.\n\nEach day I would wake up and clear my work area. I had left the hole far behind and had setup camp near the water's edge. The waves would hit the newfound shore but it never climb much further.\n\nI began to believe that this island was seasonal. Appearing when the water was low and being engulfed during high tides throughout the year. And that the hole had always been there. stretching into the mantle and dispersing into steam as tectonic plates shifted. Which led me to think that there must be more of these bottomless holes out there, dotting the globe, hiding under the water as we floated over them.\n\nAnd that my situation was no different than being a cast away. So I had to simply sail myself out.\n\nThese thoughts kept me going as I scoured the jungle for materials. I had inventoried the weeds into three distinct groups. One was strong and sturdy, which I would use to build the base of my raft. The other good for binding and weaving a sail. And the third for its fruit.\n\nI had been reluctant to eat the fruit, even resorting to chewing on the malleable weeds which proved to be unconsumable; at first. But as I reached my starving point, as the water had dried up and the fish were long gone. And I was about to give in.\n\nThe slugs came.\n\nOr at least they looked like slugs. They were flat and nearly translucent. If it weren't for the faint glow that they sometimes emitted. I wouldn't have even noticed them covering the branches near the hole.\n\nI had seen them once or twice, in the day, near the top of the weeds, initially mistaking them for dew. But it was during the night when I would realize that they were tiny creatures eating the fruit.\n\nAfter I snatched one, and squished its head under a rock. I lit a fire by rubbing two sections of a broken down weed together. There I cooked the slug but found it better eating, raw. Their consistency was that of duck tongue, but their flavor reminded me of beef. Bone marrow if I had to be specific. Not bad, but when I discovered that if I allowed the slugs to digest some of the fruit before consuming them, I couldn't stop eating them.\n\nThe first time it happened my reaction was immediate disgust. I had picked a slug without realizing it had a botched piece of fruit swimming in its stomach. The taste was horrendously sour and I was worried that I had consumed something rancid during my feasting.\n\nThe acidity was so overwhelming, that I spit it out as my throat contracted. Fearing for my life I tried to drink water but the airway was so thin I could barely breathe. As I started to wheeze, a familiar sensation overcame me. I felt as if I was drunk. And that I was the man. Oh yeah....I could do anything! These wobbly knees were feeling strong. Stronger than ever. Things couldn't be any better! I had a plan of action. A way to realize it. And now a palatable food source that also gave me this. This energy!\n\nIt was night at the chance encounter, and yet I was roaring to go to work. Which I did. Finding myself in some rampant rage to finish. Only to wake and doing it all over again. Consuming these slugs filled with the fruit until the edge began to wear off.\n\nOne slug turned to two. It was only a matter of time before I was stuffing down handfuls of them throughout the day in order to sustain the euphoria. And when that wasn't enough. I finally drove myself to the top of the third type of weed. And picked the fruit. Peeled it. And ate it right from the source.\n\nI came in and out of consciousness for many days and many nights afterwards. Or perhaps it was only several hours. I do not remember. All I know is that when I regained my humanity. The hole was groaning in the distance, the water was harsh against the shore, and my legs were covered in slugs. I screamed as I felt one crawl against my neck. I felt it reach into my mouth, probe against the roof above my tongue, and tickle me. It was like a flashback that I could see. Then another. Soon I was having trouble controlling my arm. Instead those fingers caressed my face as if it had longed to be touched. Immediately I suspected the prolonged effects of the fruit as I lost my left eye. The vision shut down completely. It suddenly became dark on one side, causing me to come tumbling into the sand.\n\nThe fall dislodged my senses, and with my free hand I reached into my mouth to pull the slug out as I got to my feet. I could feel its thin slimy tendrils pressed into my throat as I pulled the suctions off the pink of my skin and squeezed my hand shut around its body. I could almost hear it scream as the slug oozed out of my palm. Slowly I felt my vision return to normal. And regained control of my lost appendage. I got to my feet and tried tearing off as many slugs off of me as I could. But there were just too many, and the tides were closing in. I could hear the water coming.\n\nSo I shut the qualm wailing in my heart and ran with all my might toward the raft. Several times I was nearly lifted off my feet as I jumped and dove through the jungle as the hole began to breathe, uprooting bits and pieces of the dead within its grave. But I managed to hang on to the last banded straws and forced myself aboard the flotation device.\n\nOcean water came circling in. I prayed that we would float as the water rose, crashing past me like long fingers tearing out the ground as I was lifted into the air. I opened my sail but to my horror the thing folded backwards. The raft crashed into the remaining limbs that punched through the surface of the cold water, before settling enough for me to slash the sail open. But it was no use. My raft and I were dragged toward the center. As I went over the edged, I had one look of the darkness staring back at me before it swallowed me whole.\n\nIt felt like falling in a dream that never stopped, an unending rollercoaster all the way down to the bottom. Until there was nothing.\n\nWhen I woke up. I was being hauled onto a large ship. It was grey steel all over and the deck hands were stripping me naked as I stood unevenly. I could hear their voices but not make out any of the words. Several of them recoiled in horror as they saw the slugs on my ankles and thighs. One of the older men pushed the shocked others, and brushed roughly at my legs as he wrapped me in a blanket.\n\nI watched numbly as the older man forced me to sit. And when I finally leaned against his shoulder and cried. The others scrambled into action. Someone handed me a jacket, while one of them rubbed the blood back into my legs. Another gave me a mug filled with warm coffee, ordering me to drink. I could smell the thick roast in my dry beaten throat, and greedily poured it into my mouth, burning my tongue. My face contorted, but not from the heat. It twisted into horror at the sight of the slugs dropping into the water and swimming off like beads of white paint.\n\nWhen I told them what had happened to me. None of them believed me. They said I had grown delirious from the solitude and perhaps from swallowing salt water. Not even after I rested, would the captain hear my pleas.\n\nInstead on our voyage to a nearby port, the crew spent their time trying to convince me that I had conjured the island and this impossible fantasy in order to cope with my ordeal. But I know they're wrong. Because once I was strong enough to stand in front of a mirror, and open my mouth wide. I could still see the tiny ring marks in the back of my throat whenever I say [ahhhhhh](https://www.reddit.com/r/CornerCornea/comments/u6rx8n/subscribe/).",

        "text": "I am 40 years old, U.S. Army Chef who recently moved on with military stuff to start a career as a Cook who works as a school cafeteria in a certain elementary school across the western side of the country. It was not a farfetched decision. 3 years before dismissal, I had visited a school to volunteer in a veterans day festival, and there I met an old colleague of mine, after some discussion with him, not to mention that I had been dealing with multiple reports in private relating to the terrible school food situation in America. While this might not sound like a big deal, the problem was that the school was located in Kansas, which is halfway across the country, and at that time I was living in Washington DC. \n\nI still have no Idea Why I have decided to work at a school halfway across the country. I was serious about working there, but at the same time, I didn't think about the distance between work and home first. When I told my mom about it, she said she knew this would happen one day.\n\nI’ll admit it, I am a legitimately stupid person. I can go as far as saying that I am the stupidest man in Washington DC. While I had no trouble with basic knowledge and math and all sorts of things, I was stupid when I was in a state of making a choice. You know how there are some characters like Patrick Star from Spongebob who are considered as a definition of a dumb characters, imagine that as me. \n\nWon’t go into details about the things that I have done with dumb decisions, but to make a long intro short, I was going to move halfway across the country to work as a chef for a school cafeteria. \n\nI immediately contacted the associate (I will refer to him as ‘BB’ to describe the events) to arrange a place to stay until I manage to get a house in the state, and With his permission that he can get me a room in his house, that was when I decided to pack the things I need to take from my family’s house before I leave to a new state. I had high hopes on the way back home because this would be meeting my family, mom, and dad in 7 years (I decided to not meet them occasionally because of multiple reasons, The last time I actually did meet them for a short period was nearly 4 years ago.)\n\nAs soon as I got out of the camp, I used some of the money I had gotten from military work to immediately rent a small sedan and drove to the town. While that was happening, I immediately contacted my mother, only to hear nothing other than the beeping of the phone. Indicating that the number was no longer used. At first, I thought this was not a big deal and thought they were all out doing something or their phones were just turned off. \n\nThat thought wavered when I entered my neighborhood and my hunch told me that there was something seriously wrong happening in the town. \n\nAs soon as I entered, the first 5 houses on the left and right row were all for sale, one place had a car inside that looked like it had not been used for a year as if the owner just left when he or she moved out. 3 of the houses on Sale were cheaper than most of the house prices in America. One particularly cheaper as if the homeowner was begging the house to be sold. \n\nThat was not just the houses that were on sale when I drove deeper into the neighborhood, At first, I thought this was a joke. But out of all 39 houses in the street where I live, 30 of them were on sale, Meaning that right now only 9 families are living in this neighborhood. The houses without people had cars parked on them that definitely did not belong to a real estate agent or any of the officials. It was definitely a car that the original owner of the house have used before their disappearance. \n\nCurious to find out about the neighborhood's events, I parked my car somewhere far from my house and started walking towards my house as I looked around. Then I reached the address which had my mailbox and immediately knew that something seriously wrong was happening in this town.\n\nMy House is located in a middle of a pathway leading to another house, I know that the other house is owned by an Our Family Friend, Mrs. Washington. What greeted me was her house… burned down to the ground… The rooftops were charcoal black from the fire, every single curtain painted with black marks of fire, and her car was standing in front of the garage, which was enough evidence to tell me that Mrs. Washington… Did Not Make it out alive. \n\nDreaded by the fact that Mrs. Washington no longer exists in this world (I did not know her close but she was a nice lady who made cookies for me every birthday when I was young), I went to my house and saw nobody inside. At first, I had been expecting Mom and Dad to be Out in the malls shopping or they both went to work (Both of them work at a Pharmacy) but when I checked the time, I knew that was not the case, as it read 4:20P.M, which is usually the time when They should be at home. \n\nSpeaking about Time, when I went inside my house, I checked the clock to see it stopped moving. In fact, The clock was now filled with cobwebs and so did other parts of the house, it felt as if my parents have abandoned the house for a long time. And that was when I started to get worried, How do I contact them since there were no phone numbers left?\n\nI checked the house up and down to see if there was anything that Mom or Dad have left as a clue to Their whereabouts, I eventually stumbled upon a Sticky note that was in the middle of the table with a Phone number and an Address… I won't go into details with the exact address, but they were not even in Maryland, Their new address was Pennsylvania, meaning they have moved houses to somewhere far. \n\nThis confused me since, It wasn’t common for any of them to move houses, or outright move houses outside the state of Maryland, over the past 20 years, our family was all living all across Maryland, and the fact that they moved states made me feel uneasy.\n\nAnyways, I did manage to contact my dad, and When I asked about the things that have happened in the town, He explained a timeline of events that have been occurring over the last 2 years, which were something that nobody would ever imagine happening in the 21st century.\n\nA serial killer.\n\nThe First confirmed the victim was a guy who lived at the top of the neighborhood. In a twist of events, he moved into the house 3 days before his murder. The Real Estate Agent, who came to the house to discuss multiple contracts with the victim, was the one to report the body. Two stab wounds on his chest. \n\nHowever, this one murder was enough to put the cops on alert, The Fire in Washington House occurred 1 week before the man’s murder, and the fact that the fire was hot to the point where the only thing they discovered after the fire were the bones of the residents, The Police were suspecting foul play, as they couldn’t find anything that can naturally have the fire in a high temperature in the scene. \n\nDad said that there was a 3rd death in the street, an entire family of doctors living at the very bottom of the street. Hearing that news was enough for them to get out of town and never return, He said that they immediately took their cars and roamed around motels for a while before getting a house in Pennsylvania.\n\nAn Overreaction, but I Understand. Because I told them that multiple houses are on sale at a cheap price, and Dad said that ‘houses at the cheap price’ represent a house where a death has occurred.\n\nSo as soon as I returned from Military work, I was dealing with a town where a serial killer roams among us, who presumably burned Washington’s house, killed innocents such as children and basically wiped out the entire neighborhood by killing and causing others to be driven out, including my mom and dad.\n\nAfter the phone call, I thought for a while if I should follow Mom and Dad’s footsteps and get the hell outta here before the serial killer comes and gets me killed. I might be a soldier, but I was a vulnerable target considering my stupidity. I could trust anyone and anyone could be stabbing me in the back in this scenario.\n\nAnd that was what I decided to do. I was going to stay here for a day or two. Start a Garage Sale and sell as many things as I can before taking the remaining stuff into the car I rented and driving to my new job, Kissing Washington DC Goodbye.\n\nSo that was what I did. My idiotic Impulse told me to ‘hey, start a garage sale before you leave this state!’ and with my mom’s permission and a discussion with her about what is supposed to be sold, I prepared for one. I immediately cleaned the garage and started looking for things that I can sell before moving out of this state. A bunch of old board games, movies, and clothes that did not fit were on the floor. I checked my room to grab a Military kit and a civil war module, a cooking module, and a bunch of old cookbooks. And all the other stuff was going on the floor.\n\nThen, I Made a post on the community website saying that I am holding a garage sale, but my job was far from done. I had to clean the house, Scrub the floor, Mow the garden, Remove the cobwebs, and fix the broken lights. \n\nAfterward, I approached My Dad’s study and found multiple newspapers lying all over. Once I realized that it was all newspapers regarding the murders and potential suspects, I had an interest in it and took to the kitchen to read it as I eat dinner.\n\nWhen I came back home, it was 2:00 P.M., and once I finished my duties as a house owner, It was 6:00 P.M., And I had no energy to cook at that moment.\n\nI Ordered Chinese noodles for my house, and once I had Noodles on the table, I started reading the newspapers regarding the murder victims. It was pretty distressing, to say the least. The Newspaper did tell me about the people that were murdered, and how they were killed. Some of them died outside the streets with a simple weapon, and some of them died with more cruelty in their deaths. While it was not common for me to say this, once I saw the victim’s ages don’t go over double digits make up almost half of the victim list, and the killings on them were described more brutally, It didn’t take me long enough to realize that this killer in this town was an irredeemable monster.\n\nThe Sheer Hatred that suddenly erupted inside caused me to crush the newspaper and throw it on the floor, Just reading about his crimes made me puke. I was right now living in a street, where one of the residents was murdering other residents, enjoying every single moment, bringing despair and fear to the survivors, wondering if they were next. Which might be the exact thing that Motivated Mom and Dad to get out of the state.\n\nYou Fucking Hurt Kids in America, I congratulate you, unnamed killer. You have successfully turned the entire Nation into your enemy, I don’t know who you are, but Do this world a favor and kill yourself.\n\n30 Deaths, 17 of them children, starting with Neighbors of mine. The fact that I was heading to a school to feed children good stuff and I had personal connections with Mrs. Washington, Made me harbor hatred that seemed to come out of hell.\n\nI wondered what would Mrs. Washington do if she was alive, probably come home to greet me with her children, Jack and Harold (Whose names were also on the list of victims, unfortunately), and probably since I am an old man, feast ourselves with Beer and Alcohol (Yeah, she was an alcoholic who would drink a lot, it was actually a miracle that she didn’t go outright apeshit being drunk and didn’t beat her kids)\n\nDuring My Time in the Military, I met this guy who used to work as a Policemen, and the thing that he told me stood out to me as one of the saddest things I’ve heard in my life: That he genuinely wishes murder mysteries to be just in movies and games because there is nothing more depressing than hearing the news that your loved ones are dead.\n\nNow, this entire murder stuff is genuinely gut-wrenching, and insane and honestly pisses me off, but I couldn’t stay pissed off since I had to do something. Garage Sale.\n\nThe rest of the evening, I forgot the newspaper stuff and placed the things I was going to put on the garage sale on display with prices going from 3 dollars to the most valuable one being 50 dollars (A Vase), and after that, the fateful day was going to come Tomorrow.\n\nI headed to my room with my bed (which I planned to take by using the service they use to deliver furniture to new houses) and immediately blacked out. When I woke up, it was early morning. \n\nI checked the community post and it didn’t get as much interest from anyone. The People who were interested in the community post were not because of the garage sale, but rather interested in the fact that the place where the Garage sale was happening was… y’know.\n\nAs soon as I realized that I had a garage sale, the stupid instinct inside me disappeared, and I realized what I was forgetting, something that is important in the garage sale: Seed money.\n\nI immediately took off with a coat and ran to the nearest bank, and as I was walking there, looked at the basket of newspapers where the dairy had placed to show the latest issues of the community. The words that were headlined were: WASHINGTON MURDERS, 3 YEARS LATER.\n\nOh great, I have forgotten that the reason why My mom and dad ran away from the state was because of a serial killer. I took a newspaper from the basket and started reading about the murders. \n\nAnd This Newspaper blew my mind. The thing that was written in the newspaper genuinely freaked me out, and I could understand the reason why people were running away from our neighborhood in fear that they were next.  It appeared that the newspaper my Dad had in his study was a year old, and this latest issue gave me a new story I did not see in the house, something far worse about the killer.\n\nThe Killer had a Nickname, ‘The Washington Reaper’, and is now considered not just one of the worst serial killers in the state, but easily one of the worst serial killers in the entire nation. The number of victims was not 30, but 55. And that is just the confirmed victims. The Real Kicker of this murderer is that, this killer of 55… Had many suspects, but police data suggested that the killer is at least 15 years old minimum.\n\nThe Police were stating that the killer of 55 could be an fucking teenager, so what did that mean? I immediately regretted my decision to start a garage sale. But hey, It was a promise I made and it is an unspoken rule that veterans who serve the country must follow every promise, no matter how bad the consequences are. But that newspaper made me go alert.\n\nAfter I got my seed money, I set up my shop and greeted the survivors of the serial killings in the garage. Most of the people who came here were new faces I have not seen. One of the older men who came to visit my shop looked at the remains of the Washington house and SIghed. \n\n“Man, I used to teach one of the kids, Jack, how to play the guitar.” He said. Probably reminiscing about the past. I used to play the guitar when I was young, so The Old man’s words immediately sparked my interest. I told the old man that I wanted to talk to him and he and I shared some words while the garage was open. \n\nThe guitar part was a Lie, I was a Pianist, but the reason why I wanted to talk to him was that I had fond memories with Jack Washington, Mrs. Langdon’s Eldest Son. 10 years ago, I had knowledge of how to play the piano, and being on good terms with Jack, He would sometimes come over and listen to me playing the piano.\n\nThroughout my military service, I had gotten letters from Mrs. Langdon, a letter of gratitude as she believes that I have motivated Jack into learning Guitar, which makes me think again right now… The fire in Langdon House happened a day after I got the letter.\n\nI didn’t tell the old man that part, but it seemed like he knew That a series of misfortune events had turned a nostalgic story into a twisted tale. He was looking at me like he knew what was happening, and was looking stunned. \n\nAfter a brief moment of silence, the old man took a small hat and paid me the price before walking away from the garage. The next person to come to the garage was a little girl and a Mommy, who gave me a bad impression from the fact that she had alcohol in her left hand and looked extremely drunk. I don’t know the thing, but If I had to guarantee that the serial killer looked insanely bad, then that woman was the prime suspect.\n\nShe would suddenly look sober, and glare at the garage, before walking away. I was confused, and she might have confused the next customer as well. But the thing about the next customer was that he was also giving me a weird impression since he was wearing nothing but an undershirt and underpants, looked like An Hippie, and also had a serial killer look to me.\n\nHowever, he was actually saner than the woman. He just looked around the shop and picked up small Shoes and a baby shoe before paying me and leaving without any problem. Still, I did not let my guard down. Let’s say I felt a bit of ‘insanity’ inside him, whether it is due to the murders or him hiding something inside, I don’t know.\n\nAfter the man left, A teenage boy at the age of 17 came to my shop without anyone noticing. He was looking at the shoes on display, looked at me with hands behind his back like he was my senior, then gave me a look that said ‘just looking’, before walking out. This time I did not feel anything weird about the situation. It was actually far more normal than the man and the drunkard. \n\nThen, he looked at the Remains of the Washington Family’s House, and then when he walked away. When He was gone, I realized that with another creepy coincidence, The Teen was wearing the same clothes I have seen in the video of Jack playing the guitar. \n\nWhile it was common for the survivors of the serial killings to tell the story of the fallen to the new folks of the neighborhood, it just felt weird to see a lot of remnants of the deceased, the letter was one thing, and then the teen wore the clothes that Jack Wore in the video before his murder.\n\nCurious, I checked the newspaper to see if Jack Washington was actually outside the house when the crime occurred, and while I had high hopes, That Hope shattered when Mrs. Washington’s name came after Jack Washington, telling me that Jack Was no longer with us. \n\nAfter a few hours, I decided to take a short break and headed to a small Pizzeria that I used to go to when I was in High school to buy Pizza. I had fond memories of the people working there, but the person I missed the most was Leone, a friend of mine who said he was working at the pizzeria by the time when I started my service in the military. \n\nWhen I went there, I discovered that the Pizzeria’s name was changed to something else and that usually meant that the owner of the building had changed. Leone was also not a person who was with us anymore. \n\nUnlike the other victim’s families and friends, who managed to cope in time, or left the state in despair. When Leone heard that his friend was fallen at the hands of the monster, He had ended up succumbing to despair, and a few days later hung himself in the middle of the park. \n\nWhat makes this death far worse is that the serial killer knew that Leone had killed himself. \n\nA few days after the Suicide of My friend, the police got the first-ever letter from the killer. There was no evidence or DNA Found on the letter so the thing itself was useless. However, the thing that made me alarmed about the letter was what was written on it.\n\nThe Killer stated that he was enjoying all of these killings he is doing, has no intention to stop, and even told the police themselves to off themselves if they want to stop the killings, adding the phrase: “Like that stupid Leone Dude”\n\nHearing that prompted me to just leave the pizzeria, I grabbed a small sandwich from the grocery and went back to my garage. \n\nWhen I went to the garage, That was when I discovered something lying on the ground, An Red VHS Tape. \n\nI believed that The VHS Tape was something that had my memories in it. When I was a little kid, My Dad used to take me to a lot of places across America, and film both me and my mom enjoying life as we knew it and making Home Videos. If my memories were right, Before My dad became older and had to find a different Job (I heard that he got a job at a library), He used to work in a small warehouse that makes VHS Tapes when Customers ask for them to be made. So it wouldn’t be weird for him to sometimes download the files he has gotten from the video recorder to his computer before doing some mechanical mambo jumbo to create a VHS Tape of our life.\n\nI smiled and took the red VHS Tape and put it in my bag. I was going to take this VHS Tape home and tell Dad that I want to keep it so I can at least see some memories while I was far from them.\n\nWhen the Afternoon came, I packed my garage for the last time and contacted BB about meeting him at his house in two days. Since I had no car, I was going to take a train to the state of Kansas, so All I could actually take to my new life, for now, was the things I put in my two bags.\n\nSo, I contacted Dad with my intention to donate the remaining furniture that I can’t take to Kansas, and when he permitted, I got in contact with the real estate agent to get rid of the furniture in my house when I am gone. \n\nDiscovering that My train was going to leave at midnight, I spent the rest of the day sleeping, at 11:30P.M., I opened my eyes and that was really the time to say goodbye to Washington D.C. I took my three-wheeled bags and walked to the train station, I got myself the ticket, which said I needed to take transfers in both Pittsburgh and St Louis. \n\nOnce my body was on the train it was the end of my chapter in Washington. A new one was going to begin in Kansas.\n\nAnd oh man, did I mention that the train had some of the comfiest seats in the world? As soon as I sat down on the chair, I decided that it was comfy enough to take a doze off, I closed my eyes In hopes of waking up in an hour or two, the thing I woke up to was a Train conductor shining a flashlight at my face, saying they have arrived in Pittsburgh.\n\nIt was 6 o'clock in the morning when I woke up, and the next train was going to be in 4 hours. I took this as an opportunity to eat breakfast and wander around the station until the train to St. Louis, the longest train of the journey, arrived.\n\nDuring the journey, I sat down next to an old man, who started the journey in Pittsburgh, his destination was also Kansas, as he was heading there to see his grandchildren. The Two of us talked to each other and made some relationships. I told them my story and the old man’s face suddenly looked at me with pity. I don’t know if I should be angry about it, But I had no bad feelings toward the old sir. Our friendship on the train was strong to the point where the two of us would combine the things we bought on the way to Kansas to eat, And because of the combined meals, the old man and I ate enough on the train. After Dinner, we would talk until midnight. The old man closed his eyes with the words that he was sleepy, and I followed him to sleep.\n\nThe Old Man Woke Me Up in the middle of the dawn, at that moment, the train to Kansas was nearing its destination and knowing that BB woke up at dawn, I contacted him to meet me at the Station. A few minutes later, I arrived at the Station, took my bag, and waved the old man goodbye as I headed out to See BB. \n\nBB was waiting for me outside with his blue Sedan. If I could describe BB, despite being one of the only associates I had in the country, At first I had different thoughts about working with him before. I remember him before I met him in school as an extremely psychotic person, who would prone to extremely violent outbursts. And making me feel more insecure was his appearance, two years ago he had hair, but now he's bald, and his beard looks like a meat-worshipping primitive.\n\nBB told me to get in the car and I told him the story about the murders. While I was expecting him to know, it was still an unexpected discovery for me to find out that he knew there was a serial murderer in New York over the time when I was in the military. Then I told him about the Garage Sale, and that was when the VHS Came back to my memory.\n\nI contacted dad and I told him that I had a red VHS tape that he didn't take when he ran away and that I would send it by courier from Kansas. My dad asked me if I said that right, that if I found a Red VHS Tape. And when I did, He said something that was completely out of the blue. \n\nHe says that even though his memories might be janky because of age, one thing he can assure is that he NEVER Made a Red VHS Tape to store his memories. He was genuinely wondering what was going on. \n\nSomething wasn’t right. If my dad meant the truth, that meant that this Red VHS Tape was something I have, not anyone in our family-owned. Then I was starting to feel the absolute creeps in my back. \n\nI asked BB If he had a VHS Tape player and when we arrived at the house, he took me to his living room and put the red tape into the player. When he turned on the TV, There was a gray menu screen with multiple videos on display. I was at that moment thinking for the worst. One of the video’s thumbnails… was the fire in Mrs. Washington’s house. \n\nWith shaking hands, I pressed play. The thing that greeted me from the video was a scream. The Scream of Mrs. Washington, the video would then show Mrs. Washington banging on a window, trying to get out, and the video ended. \n\nBoth BB And I looked at each other, BB looked at me with caution, and when the videotape returned to the menu screen and showed the date of the thing being filmed, He knew that it was not who filmed the video. The Date when this snuff film was on video was during my time in the military.\n\nI breathed heavily and continued scrolling through the thumbnails of each video, some of the videos had blood on the walls, and some of the video thumbnails showed a corpse lying on the concrete.\n\nI pressed one of the videos of gore, and It was something I couldn’t believe at first. A teenage girl was tied to a chair facing the roof. Then approaching her was the Teenager, wearing Jack’s clothes, like the one I saw on the Garage Sale. \n\nAfter the teenager repeatedly stabbed the victim to their death, the boy approached the Camera and as he was fumbling for a way to find the ‘stop record’ button, I saw the face of the killer. Accidentally showing parts of the crime scene, a burnt house.\n\nLike a hunter who caught food, Jack was smiling with happiness. \n\nThe last frame was the shape of his smiling mouth. \n\nThe smiling lips of pure evil were looking at me.",

        "text": "The first time we noticed it was when the house ate the flowers. It was a little bouquet of peonies that Aaron’s mom had picked from her garden. We left them out in a vase overnight, and when we woke in the morning, they were gone. \n\n“I never brought you flowers,” she told us. The kids didn’t remember either. Only Aaron and I had any memory of the moment where she burst in the front door holding them, welcoming us to our new home.\n\nThe house’s appetites soon became obvious. Anything that could be consumed disappeared in rapid time. Meat from the butcher never lasted overnight in the fridge. Vegetables rotted in a matter of hours and then disappeared entirely. Even the wood furniture decayed faster than usual, breaking down in a matter of months.\n\nEvery time it happened, Aaron and I would exchange a knowing glance, even as the children denied we’d even been grocery shopping the day before or that the dining room table had ever existed.\n\nI was afraid, of course. I wondered if I’d wake one morning to find myself missing a limb, or one of the children gone. Aaron tried to reassure me: living things were unaffected. He and I were healthier than ever. Even our kindergartner, Grace, barely ever got sick. Our older boy, Derek, was healthy as a horse and acing second grade. Even our white lab, King, seemed extra spritely, though he was getting on in years.\n\n“We should leave,” I told Aaron. “We don’t know what it’s capable of. It’s clearly some kind of curse. Who knows when it’ll come for us.”\n\n“You’re probably right,” he said. He was always trying to make me happy.\n\nAnd so for a while we diligently watched Zillow for other houses. This was during the tail end of Covid, though, and we’d bought the dip. Everything was getting more expensive, especially when you factored in the new interest rates. Every day, a move felt farther away.\n\nAnd then King died. We should have seen it coming. He’d been a step slow on his walks, and he hadn’t pooped in two or three days. Finally, he made some kind of retching sound that woke us up in the middle of the night. We went downstairs to find him dead in the middle of the living room.\n\n“We’ll take care of it in the morning,” Aaron told me, hugging me close. King had been mine even before we got married. I held him one last time, saying goodbye.\n\nBy the time we woke the next day, he was gone. Grace and Derek ran around the yard happily as Aaron made pancakes, and I looked out at the ocean with a 1,000 yard state. After a few minutes, Derek ran up to me and handed me a chew toy.\n\n“Look,” he said. “One of the neighbor’s dogs must have left this in our yard. There’s a bunch of them.”\n\n“It’s not good,” I told Aaron that night. “It’s not right.”\n\n“Maybe it’s for the best,” he said. “They’re happy.”\n\n“Because they don’t remember they ever had a dog. They *loved* King. Now that’s just… gone.”\n\nAaron rolled his eyes. “Not all pain is good pain,” he said. “Maybe some things are better left forgotten.”\n\nI thought back to my own girlhood, when I’d lost Priscilla, my beloved black cat. A neighbor’s rottweiler had wrung the life out of her. It was the first time something I’d loved had died. \n\nFor a few weeks after, I didn’t fully understand. I still thought she’d come curl up with me as I went to sleep once she was better. And then finally, it dawned on me that there would be no better, that some things really could be lost forever.\n\n“Losing a pet is one of those childhood touchstones,” I said. “Something you look back as what defines you. It leaves a scar. We’re more interesting with scars.”\n\n“I love you,” said Aaron. “And all of your scars. But no one goes out looking to get one on purpose. If we can protect the kids, we should. Right?”\n\n“Right,” I said, curling up next to him, too tired to argue.\n\n“Who owned the place before you?” asked my sister, Amy, one day when I had her over for a glass of wine. I had told her everything, but when I tried to offer proof by leaving a small spill of wine on the ground, it didn’t disappear. The house liked to keep its secrets.\n\nAmu had a little boy named Carter, a second grader just like Derek, and while we sipped our Chardonnay, we watched the two of them running in the grass, occasionally wailing on each other with foam swords. \n\n“Some old lady sold it to us,” I said. “No family. She was downsizing.”\n\n“Huh,” she said. “Isn’t downsizing for people whose kids go off to college? Sounds like she never had a family to begin with.”\n\nI thought about that for a few seconds. Now that Amy mentioned it, it *did* seem strange that the seller had called it downsizing. I was about to follow up when we got interrupted breaking up a fight, and by the time we got back to socializing, I’d completely forgotten our train of conversation.\n\n“Do you think the house messes with the taste of the wine?” I asked. “Like, does it taste more like vinegar to you?”\n\n“I don’t mind a little age,” she said. “Plus, I think you’re fucking crazy anyway.”\n\n“I knew you wouldn’t believe me,” I said.\n\n“Oh, no. I totally believe you about the house,” she said. “I just also happen to think you’re fucking crazy.”\n\nAfter Amy left, I remembered her offhand comment about the previous owner, and I got to thinking. What if the woman *did* have a family at some point. And what if they’d died in the house? Would they also have been erased? Did the woman even remember? \n\nI couldn’t sleep as the questions bounced around my mind, until finally I got up and headed down to the kitchen. I tried to find a slice of cake from earlier in the fridge, but it was long gone, paper plate and all. The kitchen was amazingly sterile. Little spills of milk or juice disappeared almost right away. Crumbs too. You probably could have done surgery on the counter.\n\nThen I headed to my office and dug up the previous owner’s information. She was named Pamela Chung, and she’d owned the house for over fifty years, living there all by herself. Not knowing quite what to say, I drafted a quick email, asking if she’d be available to grab coffee and talk over some of the house’s quirks. \n\nSince it was around three in the morning, I wasn’t expecting a reply for a few hours, days maybe. But Pamela wrote back right away, inviting me to her new apartment the next morning.\n\nPamela’s apartment was kind of a wreck. It wasn’t like something out of Hoarders, exactly, but there were plenty of dirty dishes scattered around on bookshelves and end tables, and the whole place smelled vaguely of soup. \n\n“You’ll have to excuse my housekeeping,” Pamela apologized as I swept some crumbs to the side before sitting on the couch. “I’m afraid fifty years in that house spoiled me as a cleaner. I do make an excellent cup of coffee, though. Interested?”\n\nI nodded, and she headed to the kitchen. There was something oddly comforting about the untidiness of the place. I realized it had been months since I’d cleaned a wet ring from a coffee table or even washed a towel. There was just no need. \n\nA few minutes later, she came back and handed me the coffee, which was as delicious as advertised.\n\n“There’s something about the way that house affects the beans, isn’t there?” she said, sipping a mug of her own. “It’s the little things that you don’t realize.”\n\n“So… you experienced some unusual properties in the house?” I asked.\n\n“Well of course,” she said. “That house is hungry. Not necessarily in a bad way, not to my thinking. Just like any other tool, it all comes down to how you use it.”\n\nShe sipped her coffee, assessing me. \n\n“Tell me,” she said. “Are you and your husband both on the deed?”\n\n“Of course,” I say.\n\n“Good for you,” she said. “A true partnership. You see, in my case, I came from money. My family never trusted my husband. I was the only one who officially owned the house. I was the only one who remembered.”\n\n“The realtor said you didn’t have a husband,” I said. “She said you didn’t have a family.”\n\n“Oh, that’s just how the world remembers it,” said Pamela. “The only truth is right up in here.” She tapped her head with a bony finger. “I had children too, beautiful children. But that’s all gone now. The house erased them too. But I don’t mind. It makes the memory more special, don’t you think? That it’s only mine.”\n\nI left the meeting with Pamela shaken, but at least I knew I wasn’t crazy. The house genuinely ate the dead. I was just thinking through the full implications of what it all meant when I got the call from Amy. She was hysterical.\n\n“What is it?” I asked, over and over, hoping she would calm down. But I almost didn’t want to. Amy wasn’t the type to fall to pieces over minor shit. If she was sobbing on the other end of the line, there could only be one explanation.\n\n“It’s Carter,” she finally said. “He walking home from school, crossing the street. He must not have been looking. They… they said it was instant. He didn’t feel any pain.”\n\nCarter had been Amy’s life. She’d been a single mom for almost half a decade at that point, and everything she did was built around him. Aaron and I tried to support her as she dealt with all of the arrangements: funeral, contacting relatives, arranging the cremation. \n\nBut we couldn’t be there for her at night when things got dark. She was drinking hard now, the fun Chardonnay happy hour replaced with a 24/7 bottle of something harder always at her side. She watched TV like a zombie, barely able to pull herself off the couch to use the bathroom.\n\nAll the while, Carter’s urn stood watching her from the mantel, his name etched on the side, a constant reminder of his absence.\n\nAnd worst of all, there was nothing I could really say. Because how else would you expect her to react. The one light in her life had been snuffed. \n\n“She’s just going to keep drinking until she dies,” I said. “And there’s nothing I can do.”\n\nAaron held me close.\n\n“Unless–” he started.\n\n“Unless what?”\n\n“Come on,” he said. “Don’t tell me you haven’t thought about it. It could be just like King. Remember how happy the kids were the day after he died?”\n\n“We’re not *erasing* Carter,” I said.\n\n“Fine,” he said. “But if we don’t, we might be cremating your sister next.”\n\nI cut myself shaving that night. I watched as the drops of blood trickled down my leg and dripped onto the shower floor. They disappeared before they even reached the drain.\n\nI imagined dying in this house, the speed at which my body would decay and disappear. I thought of my children playing happily in the morning, oblivious to the fact that they’d ever had a mother. \n\nAnd for the first time, I truly began to fear the house. Yes, it was a tool, just as Pamela had said. But it was a dangerous one, offering the potential for a kind of erasure worse than death.\n\nAnd I found myself shaking, despite the hot water all around me, praying I’d die somewhere far from that house.\n\nBut despite it all, I wasn’t ready to leave, just yet. There was still a use for this tool, no matter how dangerous.\n\n“Get up,” I told Amy a few days later. “I know you don’t want to, but you have to.”\n\n“No,” she said weakly, her eyes never leaving the TV.\n\n“I’m serious,” I said. “You need some fucking daylight. It’s starting to stink in here. You’re never going to feel better if you just keep doing this.”\n\n“Why would I want to feel better?” she asked, an edge in her voice. “Why would I possibly want that?”\n\n“You’re right,” I said, tears springing to my eyes. “You’re right.”\n\nAfter she passed out that night, I tucked her under a blanket and grabbed Carter’s urn as I left her house.\n\nBack at home, Aaron hugged me when he saw me walk in, urn in hand.\n\n“You’re doing the right thing,” he said. “You’re saving her.”\n\nThere were certain places in the house where it seemed to eat things quicker. We called them hot spots. The kitchen was one. The bathroom was another. But nothing beat the basement. Anything down there tended to disappear in minutes. We’d once seen it devour a pizza in less than half an hour.\n\nI took Carter’s urn down there and gave it a quick kiss. Then I set it down.\n\nI spent the next hour watching the smudges on the urn slowly disappearing, the fingerprints being erased. Then, there was a quiet sound emanating from the jar, almost like sandpaper rubbing slowly against wood. \n\nThen, finally, the metal itself seemed to grow fuzzy in my vision, like I’d squinted my eyes. And when I opened them, I realized the engraving had disappeared. Carter’s name was gone.\n\nI walked over and picked up the urn, only to find it lighter than before. Inside, it was empty.\n\nThe next morning, I woke to find Amy at my door in jogging clothes. She was beaming ear to ear.\n\n“What’s going on?” I asked.\n\n“I woke up with the mother of all hangovers and did the worst thing you can imagine: I weighed myself. When the hell did I gain fifteen pounds? Well, meet the new healthy Amy! I’m done sitting around all alone feeling sorry for myself! I’m gong to get out there and get what I want!”\n\n“That’s great,” I said. “But what do you want?”\n\n“Isn’t it obvious?” she said, gesturing to my house. “Great husband. Great kids. Awesome house! You’re living the dream, sis! And I’m not going to rest until I am too!”\n\nI realized I was crying, and that I’d never be able to explain to her why. I wiped my tears away.\n\n“You doing okay?” she asked, suddenly worried. \n\n“I’ll be fine,” I said, knowing it was a lie. I waved goodbye as I watched my teardrops disappear from the floor, down the house’s throat.",

        "text": "I had never given much thought to the idea of ghosts and supernatural beings, until I met her. She was tall and thin, with a face that seemed to go on forever. Her limbs were long and slender, and her movements were so unnatural, I was sure she wasn't human. I had no idea who she was or what she wanted from me, but she haunted me every single night.\n\nIt all started innocently enough. I would wake up in the middle of the night to find her standing at the foot of my bed, just watching me. I initially thought it was just a nightmare, but it soon became a terrifying reality. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't scream. I was paralyzed with fear.\n\nBut then she started moving, contorting her body in ways that were beyond humanly possible. Her arms twisted and bent in unnatural angles, and her legs bent backwards. I could hear bones breaking and snapping as she moved, and I felt my own bones ache in sympathy. She seemed to enjoy the pain, her twisted smile spreading as she continued her movements.\n\nOne night, she was right next to my bed, her long face inches from mine. I could smell her rancid breath as she whispered, \"I want to scare you.\" Her words sent chills down my spine and I knew I was in big trouble.\n\nI tried to leave my house, but I couldn't find the door. It was as if she had trapped me there and I was at her mercy. My nightmares became even more vivid and frequent, and I would wake up to find her contorting her body in front of me. I couldn't take it anymore, and I sought out help from a specialist, but nothing worked.\n\nThe specialist told me that she was a vengeful spirit, seeking to scare those she deemed deserving. She had attached herself to me and I couldn't get rid of her on my own. The ritual he performed to banish her only made her stronger.\n\nI was at my wit's end and felt like I was losing my mind. I couldn't escape her, and I couldn't get rid of her. She was always there, contorting her body in front of me, breaking her own bones to scare me. I was trapped in a never-ending nightmare, and I didn't know how to escape.\n\nOne night, she reached out to grab me. I screamed and ran, but she was always there, always watching me, always breaking her bones to scare me. I was never going to be free of her, and I knew I was going to be scared for the rest of my life. The crunching sound of her breaking bones still echoed in my mind, a constant reminder of my endless terror. But then one morning, I woke up to a completely different reality. The woman was nowhere to be seen and the terrorizing nightmare had finally ended. I cautiously made my way over to the bed and found her imprint still fresh in the sheets, and a residue of grime left behind.\n\nI was both relieved and frightened at the same time. Was this just a dream or was she really that powerful that she could leave an imprint and grime behind? I decided to leave the house, to get away from her haunting presence and start anew.\n\nYears have passed and I have never seen or heard from her again. But the memory of her still haunts me, the crunching sound of her bones and the feeling of terror I felt whenever she was near. I know she will always be a part of me, but I am grateful that she no longer haunts my nights.",

        "text": "Theresa walks into our *Advanced Game Design: A Sytems Approach* seminar. A guy friend of hers makes a joke as she walks over. She tells her guy friend to f#$k off as she sits down.\n\nShe is the embodiment of beauty.\n\nHer sparkling eyes, radiant smile, and blunt language make my heart skip a beat. Her dark, soft skin and silky hair are a constant temptation to gaze at, and the sound of her laughter is music to my ears.\n\nI promise I wasn't a stalker. \n\nWe had known each other for two years. We were decent friends.\n\nI admit I had been harboring a massive crush on her but would never actually tell her. We were both comp-sci majors. Both of us planned on going into the gaming industry. I sometimes caught myself daydreaming about starting a company together and getting married. I know... a bit pathetic.\n\nThe semester rolls by. We both independently stand out to our professor, Andrew. He's a legend in the gaming industry and wants to show us what he's working on. An immersive VR.\n\nThe *Desmond* program*.*\n\nWe agree to sign NDAs.\n\nAndrew begins having us meet every Saturday and Sunday from 8am-4pm. It's a bootcamp. We cover weeks of material every session. Advanced code. Situational game theory. Philosophy.\n\nWe go through extreme simulations to help keep one's own reality in focus. We're taught a method for exiting the program if we need to. We're told things will get confusing for us. I'm happy to be there, Theresa is growing frustrated. \n\nHe hasn't shown us the program yet.\n\nMonths later, we're introduced to the *Desmond* program. It's beyond anything we could have imagined. A true simulation of a reality that we design. Our consciousness is uploaded to a blank world, and our subconscious minds work together to populate the world for six days.\n\nThe *Desmond* reality begins on the seventh. From that moment, the world is simply put into motion. We build a world and time begins passing. After experimenting for a few days, we learn the exit method we were taught isn't real. Andrew lied to us. You have to live out your life until the end.\n\nWe learn this the hard way, and the lie crushes us. Theresa and I spend our lives independently. I decided to try my hand at being a painter in NYC and fail. I die at 56. She studies computer science and becomes a world-class programmer. She teaches at Cal Tech. She dies at 82.\n\nWe both finally exit *Desmond*, beyond angry at Andrew. \n\nHe just stole a life from us. He offers no apology and argues that he didn't steal a life but instead gave us an additional one. Especially since only a few minutes had passed in reality. He has us debrief him on the world we lived in. He doesn't have the technology to record it yet. He trusts us.\n\nWe both quit the program.\n\nA month later, we both return to the program.\n\nWe spend the rest of the year living out various realities. Living out full lives.\n\nDuring our second one, we fall in love in Alaska when we decide to take an opportunity to go study the Northern Lights in the spring. We blame it on proximity as we laugh at the cliche of us two falling in love. We agree to not have kids and remain somewhat distant from everyone, studying our world but not growing attached to it. We both live to be 72 by choice.\n\nOur worlds begin incorporating more surreal elements. On one occasion, Theresa's subconscious focuses too much on a movie she had watched in the real world and we live out a life in a reality where ghosts and vampires reign. It's fun, but not for the faint of heart. We both die in our early 30s.\n\nThe program seems to pick up steam. Andrew gets attention from the government. The program is acquired, and we're given free rein to accelerate it for research purposes. Theresa and I know Andrew is only sort of in charge now. We continue working, building incredible worlds.\n\nOn one occasion, during the initial six days as we build out a new world, Theresa and I talk about the future. Our future. Things change. We make promises to one another. We live out one more life together, knowing it will probably be the last one as part of the *Desmond* program.\n\nWe meet Andrew for dinner one night. At a restaurant I chose. It's not in an amazing part of the city, but the reviews are great. Theresa and I explain that it's time to find new folks for the program.\n\nAndrew understands but wishes we were more open to continue ideating new realities. At least until he can find replacements. We laugh and explain that we want to focus on living a real life together.\n\nAndrew finally comes around to it and thanks us for the work we've all done together. We chit-chat with Andrew after dinner as we wait to get our coats from the coat check. Theresa didn't check hers because she loves wearing it so much, even at the dinner table.\n\nShe receives a call and steps outside. Andrew takes the opportunity to ask me if Theresa's pregnant. I laugh and explain that she's not, but we're hoping to be soon after our wedding in the summer. It's the one thing we never wanted to risk in *Desmond*. We couldn't imagine growing attached to kids, knowing it's all a figment of our imagination. We hear yelling and commotion outside.\n\nWe finally get our coats and head towards the exit. We hear a gunshot.\n\nIt only takes a second to see Theresa's body lying on the sidewalk, a hole in the side of her head. Blood pooling under her. Killed by a stray bullet during a carjacking. I stand in shock just feet away from her. The women of my dreams stolen from me. I don't speak for 6 months.\n\nI collect all of the data I can from the *Desmond* project. \n\nI work at home developing a custom profile of her from all of our lifetimes together. I recreate her. I go to the classroom at 2 am where we always met Andrew and load everything up.\n\nI hook myself up. It's challenging, piercing my temporal lobe with the sharply pointed, thin metal rod that connects to a series of cables that connect to the primary machine. I begin to lose consciousness. And the more consciousness I lose, the more *Desmond* comes to life, slowly then all at once.\n\nThe classroom of our *Advanced Game Design: A Systems Approach* seminar appears, where our blank worlds always begin, where I asked Theresa to marry me the last time we were in the program together. I can feel her profile being loaded. She's on her way. As she appears, I'm overcome with emotion. She is my world this time around. It's her, truly and utterly.\n\nI take a step toward her, but her face is uninviting. She can tell by my demeanor what I've done.\n\nShe tells me she loves me and reminds me that we've talked about this already. That we agreed to let each other go if this happened. I tell her I know, but I wanted to ask her if she was happy with the lives we lived together. She nods and tells me she feels lucky to have had a love story. \n\nShe lets us spend the six days together, but stops the program on the eve of the seventh day, right before we'd be locked into a new life. I say I understand. It tears me up. We embrace one last time and I promise to fulfill her wish, our prior agreement we made a lifetime ago.\n\nMonths go by and I agree to work with Andrew again on an exclusive contract. He tells me he's fixed his technology to record the worlds, the next step in the progression of the program.\n\nI'm building worlds again.\n\nAndrew is right, his technology to record the worlds in the program works now. But I never turn it on when I'm inside *Desmond*. He still trusts me. I make a modification to the program of my own.\n\nMonths go by.\n\nI have lived 23 lifetimes with Theresa since her death. We've had a dozen families together, including kids who we've loved more than words can describe. The Theresa I upload doesn't know anything about the *Desmond* program. I always start our first day together in the same place. That moment in our *Advanced Game Design: A Systems Approach* seminar, right when she walks in and tells her friend to f#$k off. I feel tremendous guilt keeping her trapped in these worlds.\n\nYet I can't wait to see her tomorrow.\n\nThis is my love story. I realize I'm lucky to have one.",

        "text": "I’m a gamer, and no. Not one of those popular gamers who has millions of followers. I’m a simple high school student, gaming to escape the harsh reality of our world. I recently got a Pokémon game from my sister for my 15th birthday. I had to admit, the game wasn’t the most interesting thing ever created. It was called Pokémon Blue or whatever. If it wasn’t for my extreme obsession with Pokémon, I would have sold it. But hey, even if this game was old, it could have potential.\n\nThe game cover had a blastoise on it. Blastoise was my favorite Pokémon. It was just so cool and exciting. It makes sense since I have adored all its evolutions. I took the game cartridge out of the container it was in and got my Game Boy out. My Game Boy was a bit dirty and scratched up. But whatever, I turned my gameboy on and inserted Pokémon Blue. After it was inserted, the game's intro played. The\n\nIntro was in black and white, and it started with Gengar and Jigglypuff somewhat.\n\n\"Fighting,\" I suppose you could call it. Gengar would try to hit Jigglypuff, and then Jigglypuff would dodge, soon leading to the iconic intro. With the massive Pokémon logo and trainer holding a pokeball with Squirtle beside him.\n\nI let out a sigh as I pressed the new game option. Professor Oak appeared on screen, explaining all about Pokémon and whatever else. I skipped most of the dialogue; it was pretty boring stuff that I’ve seen in many other Pokémon games, old and new. Finally, it asked for a name. I looked at the name options and attempted to pick a new name, however. I guess the game thought I picked Blue. Due to my name instantly changing to Blue. I was confused, definitely confused. If that was even the word..I shrugged it off though—old games like these always had malfunctions. Finally, I got to the rival part. I decided, just for the hell of it, to choose Red. It made sense anyway. After that, I got to my house. Everything around me was blue, besides my body, which was red. I walked around the room, just seeing what things did and what did not. Finally, I went downstairs.\n\nIt was like a kitchen, all colored blue too. I walked over to \"mom,\" and she talked about how all boys leave home some day. Once she finished talking, I walked outside. I walked outside to the grass when Professor Oak caught me. He said wild Pokémon lived in the grass, and I needed my own Pokémon to protect myself. Soon, Professor Oak walked away, and I quickly followed after him, walking to some type of big building.\n\nThere were a few people in the building. But I kept following Professor Oak until I got to a place with a familiar person. Could it be..Red?\n\nRed turned to look at me, then back at Professor Oak. \"I’m fed up with this waiting!\" He exclaimed. Crossing his arms. Professor Oak would ignore Red and immediately talk to me, saying there were three Pokémon on the table and I could have one. I just needed to choose. I nodded and walked over to the table. Choosing squirtle. Red walked up and quickly grabbed the pokeball with Charmander. \"I choose this one!\" Red said, and soon turned to me. \"My Pokémon looks stronger.\" I ignored him and walked away. Until Red followed after me. \"Hey! \"Wait, Blue, let’s test out our Pokémon; what do you say?\" I said yes and followed him outside. He brought out his Pokémon, Charmander. And I sent out Squirttle. Red’s Charmander used scratch, and my Pokémon used tackle. After a bit of fighting, I won. Red was angry and said he’d make sure his Pokémon got stronger.\n\nI walked out of the building and went into the tall grass and fought pidgey. It was really easy to defeat, and I would then walk around for a bit, talking to people, fighting, and so on. You know, casual Pokémon stuff.\n\nI went to the Pokémon Center to heal my Pokémon, and I saw Red. I was majorly confused—what was he doing here? I don’t think he was supposed to even be here. Red walked up to me; he had a pokeball in his right hand. \"Well, hello, Blue.\" His expression quickly changed, from a huge smirk to a bit of a frown. \"We should battle, one last time.\" \"I know you hate me, so let’s get this one last battle over with.\" I was, to say the least, really confused. Was this coded into the game? Or did my sister buy a hacked game or something? Out of confusion, I opened my computer and looked up a gameplay of Pokémon Blue. To see if what I was seeing was coded or hacked. But right when I was about to open my computer, an alarming sound came from my Game Boy. It sounded like a scream of something. I turned to look at my game, and Red and I were outside the Pokémon center.\n\nHow the fuck—how did we get out here? I was questioning everything when Red started to talk. \"Hey, blue, are you in this battle or what?\" \"Don't leave me waiting here.\" Out of panic and confusion, I just pressed the yes option. \"Well, then what are you waiting for?\" \"Pull out your blastoise or something, and I’ll pull out my Charizard.\" I nodded and pulled out my blastoise. As he pulled out his Charizard.\n\nSo far, the Pokémon battle was going fine. Until Red’s Charizard did one move, causing my blastoise to faint. I sighed and went to pull out another Pokémon. But I wasn’t able to. All my Pokémon somehow fainted. But that couldn’t be right! I was just at the Pokémon Center! Red turned and smiled. \"Guess I win Blue.\" But I shook my head and said, \"No, you don’t win, Red!\" Red suddenly grinned. \"But all your Pokémon fainted.\" \"How could you possibly battle me now?\"\n\nI didn’t know what to do, and he was indeed right. How could I battle him now? Wait, wasn’t there a run option? I looked at the buttons, and indeed there were. \"Well, blue. \"How will you fight me now?\" I pressed the \"run\" option. And said, \"I won’t.\" Red screamed, \"What?!\" As I was running, Red chased me. I ran into tall grass and found a stick. Red was still chasing me; he looked pissed. I then picked up the stick and ran back to Red. He looked confused until I pushed him on the ground and stabbed him repeatedly with the stick. He screamed and kicked me, trying to stop the stick from stabbing him even more. But it was no use, his eyes would get taken out, and soon would some organs. After what seemed like forever, I stopped stabbing him. And looked down to see a dismantled, ruined corpse of what used to be red.\n\nI got up and grabbed onto Red’s dismantled dead corpse. Dragging it to a huge oak tree. And finding a rope, tying him up by his neck. I then got rid of the stick and grabbed Red’s bloodied bag. Pulling out his pokeballs and potions, and putting them in my bag. And walking off.\n\nI turned off the game after that experience. And went to sleep for the night.\n\nThe next day, I turned my game on again and got the same intro. Nothing seemed to change, and I just went back to my save file. I was inside my house, and the room looked again, normal. I walked around and then went to the TV. Where a news broadcast came up. \"Red, a Pokémon trainer, is found dead hanging by an oak tree. People have claimed he committed suicide for private reasons; others think someone killed him. \"But no evidence has been shown to support that claim.\" I turned off the TV and slowly walked downstairs. \"What have I done?\" \"What have I done?\" I said to myself, walking out of my house and going outside to see Professor Oak.\n\nHe looked upset and held Red’s bloodied bag in his hands.\n\n\"Hello..Blue. You must have heard the news about Red, yes? He supposedly killed himself yesterday, and someone stole his Pokémon and valuables. Or maybe he got rid of them, but that isn’t like Red at all! \"He adores his Pokémon too much!\" Professor Oak let out a sigh. \"Maybe the kid was going through stuff he never told me about..but…if you ever find his Pokémon, please give them to me.\" I nodded and walked away, guilt creeping up my back.\n\nRed died because of me, and it was all my fault. Yet nobody knew what had really happened yet. What a terrible act. I walked through the tall grass and found a Pokémon trainer looking to battle. It was a guy; his hair was messy, and his shirt was striped. I looked through my Pokémon and noticed all of Red’s Pokémon. I thought, \"Why not?\" And chose Charizard. But I instantly froze. When I called out Red’s Charizard ard it didn’t look right at all! As a matter of fact, its neck was broken. And its eyes and organs were torn out..just like how Red looked when I murdered him. The guy with whom I was battling took notice of this and ran off. Why... was this happening? I ran off to my house again and into the bathroom.\n\nTheir was a mirror in the bathroom, as well as a shower and toilet. I went to the mirror and washed my face. Looking back up to see my reflection. I looked worried, which made sense. I just..kept staring in the mirror until something popped up. My hands started to twitch. The thing in the mirror was Red. All ruined looking, and hanging upside down. I panicked. And punched the mirror. The glass went into my body and onto the floor. AAAAAAA- I screamed and run downstairs to find a bandage or something. There was no bandages in sight….I ran outside, soon hearing a voice in my head. \"Check..the…tree..\" \"The tree, THE TREE.\" SHUT UP!! I screamed and ran faster, soon falling onto the ground.\n\nI looked up, and saw the same oak tree where red was hanging. But wait..why..was there- more ropes..? I got closer, and saw all of my Pokémon hanging on the tree, organs ripped out….neck broken. What…? I was confused and kept looking at the tree and ropes. And that was when I saw an empty hanging rope. Where red was supposed to be. My eyes narrowed, and I soon heard laughing behind me. I turned and saw…Red.\n\nHe was back to normal, no organs taken out…nothing. I turned to him and tried to grab onto him. Until I went through him. And that’s when it hit me. I stared back at the tree, and saw my own self hanging. It wasn’t Red who was there.. I soon got the perspective of myself hanging from the tree, Red was just laughing…and laughing. That’s when he turned and smiled at me, walking away with my now bloodied bag. And the same bloodied stick in his hand. That’s when I realized, that the whole time…when I thought I killed Red…it was..actually me. Who died.\n\nI quickly removed the game from my Game Boy and threw it across the room, soon stomping on it and smashing it to pieces. I’m never..messing with that again. And that was the end of that. At least, I thought it was…",

        "text": "It was a warm summer day when I first set foot in the old, abandoned house on the edge of town. I had always been curious about the place, with its peeling paint, broken windows, and overgrown yard. It was said to be haunted, and I had heard all sorts of creepy stories about the strange noises that came from the house at night, the ghostly apparitions that could be seen through the windows, and the feeling of dread that seemed to hang in the air.\n\nI wasn't sure what to expect when I entered the house, but I was certainly prepared for anything. I had a flashlight, a camera, and a sense of adventure. I was determined to uncover the truth about this creepy old place, no matter what it took.\n\nAs I stepped inside, I was immediately struck by how dark and quiet the house was. The only sound came from my footsteps as I made my way from room to room. The furniture was covered in a thick layer of dust, and cobwebs hung from the ceilings. I felt a shiver run down my spine as I realized that no one had lived in this house for years.\n\nIt was as I was exploring the upstairs of the house that I heard the first strange noise. It was a low, mournful groan, like the wind blowing through a narrow alley. At first, I tried to tell myself that it was just the wind, but as the groaning grew louder and more persistent, I realized that it was something more sinister. I shone my flashlight in the direction of the sound, but there was nothing there.\n\nI continued to explore the rest of the house, trying to ignore the growing sense of unease that was settling in my chest. Every time I turned a corner, I expected to see something frightening, but there was never anything there. And then, as I was about to leave the house, I saw something that made me wish I had never entered the old, abandoned house in the first place.\n\nIn one of the rooms, there was a small, wooden door that looked like it led to a closet or a small storage room. I cautiously approached the door, wondering what I would find on the other side. I reached for the doorknob and was about to open it when I heard a voice whisper in my ear.\n\n\"Don't go in there.\"\n\nI jumped back, my heart racing, but there was no one there. I looked around the room, but there was still no sign of anyone. I was alone in the house, and yet, I had heard a voice.\n\nI was about to leave the house when I realized that I had left my camera in the room with the door. I didn't want to leave without it, so I reluctantly returned to the room. I hesitated for a moment, but then I reached for the doorknob and opened the door.\n\nThe room was pitch black, and I could barely make out the shapes of the things inside. I reached for my flashlight, and as I did, I heard the voice again.\n\n\"Don't go in there.\"\n\nI turned to run, but my feet wouldn't move. I was frozen in place, and I could feel my heart pounding in my chest. I heard a rustling sound, and then I saw a pair of glowing eyes in the darkness.\n\nI don't remember what happened after that. All I know is that I woke up outside the house, with no memory of how I got there. I never went back to the old, abandoned house on the edge of town. And I never told anyone what I saw in that small, wooden room.\n\nYears have passed, and I still think about that haunted house. I wonder what was in that room, and what the voice was trying to tell me. I sometimes hear the groaning sound in my dreams, and I see the glowing eyes in the darkness. And I know that I will never forget the fear that I felt in that old, abandoned house.",

        "text": " \n\nDon’t go chasing legends, the consequences are always worse than you can imagine. In my younger days I was a tomb raider. My team was the best at what they did and I had the skills to match, however in our prowess we became cocky. We would take on more complicated catacombs to find the richest corpses in France, our fences liked us a lot. \n\nOne day, a contact told us about a brand new Egyptian tomb of some ancient deity or something of the sort that had just been discovered, apparently the team wasn’t able to get in. That would be no problem for Marc, as he could blast open just about any door we’d come across. Within a couple short weeks, we’d made it to Egypt, and after a day's trek in the desert we decided to set up camp. “What do you think we’ll find in there? Gold? Jewels?” Yvonne asked.\n\n“I can’t be certain of what we’ll find, but mark my words when I say we’ll be swimming in coin by the time we can finish selling all of this.” I responded. That seemed to satisfy her enough for her to sleep. Eventually everyone else followed suit, including myself. The next morning we were able to make it to the tomb with no problem as predicted, and navigating it was no issue as we’d seen much more complex streets in France. \n\nThe main chamber was beautiful, and the treasury almost made me cry from how much there was, just for the taking. The single piece that called to me was a golden ornate necklace with a gorgeous amulet. I quickly put it on and tucked it under my shirt, the metal was oddly warm against my chest. We quickly bagged everything we could, which it turns out was basically everything, and made our escape. The travel back to the city took about two days so we set up camp once again. We talked about the gold and jewels we’d stolen, talking about what we’d spend it on and how we’ll retire when we’d get home.\n\nOnce everyone had fallen asleep I tried to sleep myself, but when I was just about to drift off a searing pain ripped through my chest, as I ripped my shirt off I saw the amulet sinking into my chest, its own design branding itself on my skin as it sank through me. My screams woke up the others as they saw the horror of what this seemingly innocuous trinket had done to me. Nothing changed, or so we thought.\n\nWhen we made it back to France we became filthy rich, and lived on the upper crust for years. As those years passed, the letters slowed, the invitations stopped coming, eventually a group of best friends simply forgot the existence of one another. I got married once, had a wonderful husband by the name of Robin. Time passed as it ever did, except it passed without me. As my husband started to wrinkle, my skin stayed fair as ever. My hair stayed black while his grayed. He tried to say I was just lucky, but I had my doubts. I realized that the amulet that had branded me so long ago had cursed me. When my husband died my research began, the name of the deity I’d stolen from had been erased from our history, but apparently it was known to hold the secret of immortality.\n\nEternal life does not mean immunity to disease, or that I cannot be hurt. I’ve spent many months in hospitals for various reasons, but I’ve always recovered. Eventually I became reclusive, only leaving when I needed to, moving when the rumors started to spread about why I’ve looked so young for so many years. I’ve been called a witch, a vampire, many other creatures that I’d never even heard of until I was discovered. It was easy when you have so much money gathered throughout the decades. It’s always felt hollow though, my sense of purpose has depleted. \n\nI don’t want to keep hiding anymore but it gets harder to go outside. There were times I didn’t go anywhere for years and the world would jump forward without me. I was stuck in the past time after time. I would be lying if I said that was the only problem. Time does something to your mind, once you get to a certain point in life a thin veil of fog starts to cover your mind, and as time goes on, the fog becomes thicker. I have lived for hundreds of years, the fog is so thick I rarely get moments of clarity anymore. As it begins to take me once more, I leave you with this. No price is worth stealing from a god.",

        "text": "Do you believe in love? Is it real? Have you ever felt it or lived it? Can it hurt in any way? Can love lead to death?\n\nIf the horror I went through in the name of love in 2009 was lived and recounted by another person, I would never believe it. This is my story.\n\n***THE FAIRYTALE***\n\nFor the sake of the post, let me summarize my past to the loss of my father very early in my life, an absent mother, an addiction, a turbulent upbringing and a rehab. \n\nAfter struggling to mend my life and at the age of 32, I found my first employment as a waitress in a fast food. A mundane place yet the setting of a beautiful encounter. \n\nThat busy afternoon, the entire place froze when he stepped in. Unfazed by their attention, the man passed through countless elegant and charming girls and approached me while I was serving coffee. \n\n\"Lorenzo.\" He simply said with a smile without greeting, and extended his arm to take my hand as if he invited me to dance. \n\n\"Melanie.\" I answered with a trembling voice, my soul bared by his piercing green eyes. \n\n\"Kathryn.\" The lady I served coffee to spoke, intruding into our moment. \n\nHe simply smiled at her, then looked back at me and that marked the beginning of something I had never experienced in my life: love, mixed with prestige and luxury to crown it all. \n\nDespite his multimillionaire status and outstanding beauty, Lorenzo preferred to lead a semi quiet life. He opened his cozy house to me, ordinary on the outside, lavish on the inside, surrounded by quiet people except for Mrs Jennings, his old nosy neighbor. \n\nGenuine feelings arose from the relationship. Because of the money, the prestige, the beauty, the status, the laughters and the personality? No. Rather because of what I considered greater than all these: acceptance. \n\nI still consumed a few shady stuff at that time, and I do not tick all the boxes of beauty standards. However, Lorenzo chose not to judge me and instead saw me as what I obviously was: a person. \n\nOne morning in March 2009, I woke up and immediately saw a trail of petals going from my pillow to out of the bedroom. I followed the trail to the garden, where red roses formed words that melted me:\n\n'Melanie, will you marry me?' I read, before finding Lorenzo bowing the knee behind me and holding a ring. \n\nTrue to himself, Lorenzo proposed a small wedding. I accepted the idea, because I was ready to trade a one day big ceremony for a lifetime with the love of my life. \n\nWe spent our wedding in absolute delight. I would have labeled it a perfect day if not for a strange woman, standing far away, who stalked us throughout the whole ceremony.\n\n***THE DARKNESS***\n\nIf you clicked on this post for the sole reason of being scared or intrigued by it, then I apologize for keeping you waiting. Now, you are about to get served. \n\nA few weeks after the wedding, Lorenzo suddenly fell sick and started coughed up blood. The same day, he traveled to meet with his 'personal doctor' as he explained to me, and I was left all alone in that big house.\n\nFrom the following morning, my days in that house were darkened by excruciating pains in the lower belly that randomly started and stopped, and by unexplainable things only happening within its walls. Things that I chose to never share with him. \n\nSometimes, I would tidy the bedroom, go and take a shower, only to come back and find the place completely trashed. The first time it happened, I thought it was the work of a robber and I ran out of the house for a few hours. As a substance consumer, I did not contact authorities for obvious reasons. \n\nThe most common occurrence was seeing shadows moving in a room from the door bottom, or instead hearing a woman inside, humming what resembled a lullaby. I would then gather the courage to open the door only to find the room empty. \n\nI have always wanted to own one or several clothing stores, and with my husband's support, I had the opportunity to realize that dream. So one day, to conquer boredom and instead of succumbing to addiction, I decided to do something more productive, therefore, I went to a mall to analyze the competition. \n\nEvery inspection I made from store to store enlightened my day as I felt like doing something good out my life and time, but all the joy vanished as soon as I noticed him. \n\nScanning me with his eyes while his colleague was talking to a security guard, the man seemed to recognize me. Their suits and sportive builds spelled one terrifying word for me: cops.\n\nI froze while he kept on staring, then I turned to begin my escape and he immediately gave chase. For at least five minutes, we snaked through the crowded place, until I finally escaped him with the help of a taxi, abandoning my car for a later and safer retrieval.\n\n***THE NIGHTMARE***\n\nThen came Tuesday, 09 June 2009, the most horrible day of my life. From the start, whatever haunted that house decided to raise the bar and woke me up, in the form of a woman sobbing in the bathroom. \n\nOne important detail about the matrimonial room is that it was 'En Suite' which means that there was a bathroom directly connected to the bedroom. \n\n\"Why? Whyyyy? Why? Why?\" The woman repeated, sobbing bitterly in the bathroom. \n\nDressed with a singlet top and my underwear, I quickly wore a jogging pants before investigating the strange occurrence. I placed my hands on the door, then my right ear, but the lady stopped on the spot. \n\nShe then banged on the door, right where my ear was and yelled: LEAVE HIM ALONE! \n\nI fell on the floor, trembling in fear and crawling backwards, while she kept on banging on the door. I turned to run away and the banging stopped, letting an ominous silence usher in the next horror that awaited. \n\nMy eyes widened at the sight of my wedding dress, standing at the other end of the room, as if worn by an invisible person. Large stains resembling mold then slowly appeared on it, before the dress quickly slid towards me.\n\nAdrenalin and fear carried me out of that house and into my car in a few seconds, under the curious look of nosy Mrs Jennings that I ignored. I drove off, not knowing where I was going and parked around twenty minutes later near a convenience store. \n\nRecovering from I saw and heard, I contemplated the idea of contacting my dealer but finally overcame the temptation after around thirty minutes. Instead, I chose to go to the store and buy cigarettes, still shaking to the core. \n\nI went back into the car and took the first cigarette out, when I felt a hand covering my mouth and something cold yet sharp land on my throat. At the same moment, I froze and the lower belly pains arose.\n\n\"Not a move, not a sound, or it will be your last one.\" She said with a thick accent, making sure to pronounce every letter of every word. \"Now move the rear view, I want you to see me.\" \n\nThe mirror revealed her identity to me. She was the woman stalking us during the wedding ceremony. Parts of her long black hair covered one of her eyes, leaving one hatred filled eye stab my soul. \n\n\"No longer looking good uh? I guess the others started visiting.\" She said, not making sense to me. \"Listen good, I'm Amandine. I don't have anything against you, but I have unfinished business with your dear husband. I don't care if you tell him what I will tell you. Either way I will catch that bastard. Everything you're living is fake. The wedding, the paid actors at the ceremony and all the money is dirty.\"\n\nShe shook her head, and I could see her trying to contain a burning anger before she continued.\n\n\"What I want you to do is to move out of my way if you don't want to get a bullet. When I'm gone, check your glove compartment. There's a journal there that will tell you why I'm doing this, and why you should run for your life, today, now.\" She spoke before releasing me and she exited the car calmly. \n\n***THE TRUTH ?***\n\nI sped off, once again not knowing where to go. That day was getting worse by the minute, and I started having a panic attack, losing my breath because of it. After a few minutes, I parked again, near a school. \n\nBreathing heavily, I managed to calm down and collected myself. I checked the glove box and there it was, the next thing that would take me to the next level of horror. \n\nAll the data inside were research about Lorenzo, everything. Instead of explaining in detail what I saw and make this post longer, let me summarize it properly for you. \n\nThe first page mentioned something about the corruption and perversion of a sacred union, the primary work of a pagan goddess through a ritual called the 9 brides. \n\nThe second page mentioned that the name of the goddess was unknown and there was a representation of her: the statue of a woman with many tentacles replacing her arms and legs and mosquito wings on her back. \n\nPage 3: the 9 brides ritual consisted of marrying a partner on the 9th of a month, then sacrificing him or her to the goddess on the 9th of the next month, during the night and before midnight, to be granted 9 years of youth, beauty and riches. Once started, the ritual had to be completed. The maximum number of marriages was 9, and after the 81 years of pleasure, the goddess will claim the soul of the occultist. \n\nPage 4: the old picture of a man resembling Lorenzo was pasted on the page along with words like occultist, bastard, the groom, blood sucker, etc...along with some information. Name: Wolfgang, Surname: unknown, Birthday: 1917, Place of birth: unknown. \n\nPage 5: there was an old wedding picture of the man with a lady. It was written '1955, 38 years old and then known as Peter, marrying Lizbeth the 09 April 1955, England. Wife mysteriously dead the 09 May 1955. First bride.' \n\nPage 6: another picture of him with another lady. Writings: '1964, still 38 years old and then known as Julio, marrying Esperanza the 09 May 1964, Spain. Wife dead the 09 June 1964. Second bride.' \n\nPage 7: a picture of a lady named Valérie. Writings: '1967, bastard fell in love with mother. 1968, I was born and named Amandine. He tried to cheat the goddess by not marrying my mother to keep us alive, but the deity threatened his life. 1973, then known as Gustave, marrying Valérie the 09 June 1973, France. Mother made me flee with Aunt Camille, then died the 09 July 1973. Third bride.'\n\nThat Amandine was trying to get revenge on her own father? I thought. Curiosity dominated me as I continued. \n\nPage 8: a picture of him and another lady. Writings: '1982, still young and 38, then known as Oleg, marrying Irina the 09 October 1982, Russia. Wife dead the 09 November 1982. Fourth bride.' \n\nPage 9: a picture of the groom with another woman. Writings: '1991, still young, then known as Emilio, marrying Matilda the 09 March 1991, Brazil. Wife dead the 09 April 1991. Fifth bride.' \n\nPage 10: a clear picture of Lorenzo, without a doubt, with another woman. Writings: '2000, still young, then known as Grant, marrying Leandra the 09 September 2000, Australia. Wife dead the 09 October 2000. Sixth bride.' \n\nI turned the page, my heart beating so hard I felt necessary to hold my chest.\n\nPage 11: a picture of us during the wedding. Writings: '2009, still young, still that same bastard, then known as Lorenzo, marrying Melanie the 09 May 2009, North America. Expected death the 09 June 2009. Seventh bride.' \n\nMy heart sank. That had to be some delusional nonsense invented by a sick mind. Why would I believe her anyway? So, Lorenzo was supposed to be 92? That was some horror movie madness I could not believe. \n\nI drove off and went back home. That afternoon, upon arriving, I found petals on the ground leading to the kitchen area, where I found Lorenzo standing, smiling, with his hands behind his back. \n\n\"You finally back.\" He said, still smiling and he approached. \"I was getting tired, you almost spoiled the surprise.\" \n\n\"Hey honey! You back? But, why didn't you call?\" I said, trying to remain calm. \n\n\"I told you, a surprise.\" He revealed a small gift in his left hand, then quickly placed his right hand in front of his mouth and blowed on a powder that covered my face. \n\n\"What hav— what have you— Lor—\" I tried speaking, instantly overwhelmed by dizziness and I crashed on the floor. \n\n\"Sorry Melanie, I'm running out of time.\" I heard him say before I lost consciousness. \n\n***THE RITUAL***\n\nCandles. I remember seeing a lot of candles when I woke up. Chains noises resounded the moment I moved and I noticed them tying my hands and feet, as well as the black wedding dress I was wearing. \n\nI was inside a black circle interlaced with another one in which there was an old man kneeling and chanting incantations in front of the statue of the goddess. \n\nA framed picture of Lorenzo and I was placed between two of its upper tentacles. When I saw the picture, the statue who stared down at the man, looked up and saw me. It was alive. \n\n\"I told— you to— run.\" I heard an agonizing female voice saying from my left and I looked. \n\nPinned to the wall by an invisible force and in an unnatural position, Amandine was suffering, bleeding from a fight she obviously lost. Next to her was a clock displaying the time: 11:36 pm. \n\n\"Now— your husband will— kill you too.\" She spoke. I realized who was the old man, and the nightmare I had just stepped into by letting Lorenzo enter my life. \n\n\"Lorenzo? Honey? Lorenzo please.\" I said, with tears streaming down my face. \"Please don't, please you don't have to do that. Please.\" I begged, ignored by the man. \"WOLFGANG!\" I called. \n\n\"Melanie.\" He said, turning to me. I gasped when I saw his face. It looked like Lorenzo's face mixed with that of an old man whose white hair was falling off his head as he moved. \"It's time.\" He added.\n\nAt that instant, the statue of the goddess opened its mouth and her eyes shone in yellow. A powerful wind coming from her blew out the candles and would have plunged the room in darkness if not for the moonlight. \n\nThat was when behind me, I noticed a black stain on the wall in the shape of a door. After a short moment, I could see yellow eyes shining from the stain and a woman in a black wedding dress with a dagger in her chest emerged. \n\nShe was followed by five others clothed with the same dress, but those five were missing parts of their flesh as if they were devoured by something. They all looked pale, dead and enraged. \n\nI screamed my lungs out at the sights of those women approaching, sliding on the floor like spirits, and I begged Lorenzo to spare my life. They all surrounded me and stared down with a hatred look no normal human can reproduce.\n***THE SHOWDOWN***\n\nAmandine's eyes were locked on one of them and she cried at some point as she recognized her. I recognized her too, in fact, I remembered all of them. Lizbeth, the first wife, with a dagger in her chest, and all the others: Esperanza, Valérie, Irina, Matilda and Leandra. They were the six previous brides. \n\nWolfgang turned to the goddess and was about to feed her with our wedding rings when all of a sudden, Amandine started singing, while crying. I could not understand the French words, but one thing was sure: it was the lullaby I sometimes heard being hummed by a woman in the house. \n\nValérie turned, looked at her daughter and with a mix of sadness, despair and anger, she let out a scream that shook the entire place like an earthquake. \n\n\"VALÉRIE!\" A furious Wolfgang called. \n\nSeizing the occasion, Amandine shouted something at her mother in French, and Valérie immediately turned towards Wolfgang, filled with hatred. He tried to put the rings in the goddess mouth, but Valérie extended her arm and paralyzed him. \n\nHe then chanted incantations and the other brides attacked Valérie but she repelled them, powered by revenge, her motherly love and the strong desire to save her daughter, even in death. \n\nWolfgang took advantage of the distraction to send Valérie flying with a simple movement of his arm and was about to feed the rings to the goddess when a man kicked the door open. It was the cop that pursued me in the mall. \n\n\"End of the road Wolfgang! Stop! Now!\" The agent said. \n\nThe groom tried to attack the agent with his powers but Valérie paralyzed him. The agent shot Wolfgang's hand and he dropped the rings while screaming in pain but stopped when the goddess started laughing. \n\nAmandine fell on the floor, released by Wolfgang's powers. He looked at the goddess with fear in his eyes I never knew he could have. He looked at the clock and gasped. I looked too and it was 12:00 am. Wolfgang had failed.\n\nLizbeth started approaching, followed by the second bride and the others as they respected the hierarchy even in death. Wolfgang chanted incantations, while aging rapidly, struggling to stand and speak. The brides surrounded him, before they devoured him, ripping him apart with a violence and savagery that spelled payback.\n\nIn a matter of seconds, all that was left of Lorenzo was blood, only blood. Some of it was splattered on our framed wedding picture held by the goddess. Till death do us part, right? At least now, that serial widower was reunited with his wives. \n\n***THE AFTERMATH***\n\nThe goddess and the brides disappeared a few seconds after Wolfgang's demise. The agent proceeded to free me from the chains, helped by Amandine. He introduced himself as Harper and explained that he was part of a group formed by his father decades ago. \n\nHis father, a former respected special agent fell from grace and was ridiculed for bringing doubted evidence about Wolfgang's supernatural abilities. Years later, Harper had finally completed the work of his father, who died in bitterness without stopping Wolfgang.\n\nWhen Amandine snuck into the house to confront her father, Mrs Jennings spotted her and called the police. However, Harper intercepted the call and used trickery for his group to take charge instead. \n\nAfterwards, I abandoned the house, the bloody and dirty money, everything Lorenzo had bought for me including the wedding ring, and I returned to my life with my heart shattered in pieces. It is in that dark place and in 2010 that I met my husband Darren, my true love and the father of my three marvelous children. \n\nFor the sake of the post, it is better not to explain how we met. I heard that people here do not like long stories and I apologize for its length. Instead, allow me to end this post on a much more positive note. \n\nI am not only talking to you Lady, but also to you Sir. I do not know what were your answers to the questions at the beginning of this post. I do not know what you may have gone through. I do not know who you are and what you do or did, but I know one thing: you deserve love too.\n\nEveryone deserves love, even Wolfgang, or any other person with issues that simply needs to be helped first. Valentine's day is after tomorrow, and if you will spend it alone it is not the end of you. Never give up on love, for a life without love is worse than death. \n\nJust like myself, stand for what is right, fight for your life and the most beautiful, powerful force and emotion: Love.",

June 12th, 1991. \n\nNo, that last part is a lie to be honest. I didn't remember the exact day that it happened- I just happened to find a newspaper clipping reporting on that day and so it had to have been on that day.\n\nI was a frequent visitor to the local arcade. I don't think I can give out any more detailed information without betraying the identities of several people involved, most of them who are still alive today, so I'll leave it at that.\n\nIt was a slow summer and I had managed to make my way through most of the games there. I had a bag of quarters earned from mowing lawns around the neighbourhood, but there was honestly really nothing that piqued my interest enough to play. \n\nUntil I saw it in the corner. \n\n\"Is that a new game?\" I asked someone.\n\n\"Dunno,\" the guy said and returned to the game he was playing.\n\nI figured, 'Why not give it a shot?' and made my way over to it.\n\n'Treasure Defender' it said in bright golden text. I put a quarter in.\n\nLevel One began immediately.\n\nNow, back in the day, most games didn't have detailed instructions on how to play them. It wasn't even like modern times where you can just whip out your phone and get a walkthrough. As such, I was left a bit confused on what to do.\n\nThere was a map onscreen. It was divided into four rooms. Each of them was empty but led into each other. There was a circle on screen, and a triangle. Next to the triangle there was a gold coin.\n\n'Defend Your Treasure' the screen said on top. No further instructions then that.\n\nThe interface only consisted of a joystick and a red button. I moved the joystick and the triangle began moving around. As I would make a move, the circle moved on its own.\n\nOkay, so I was the triangle. The 'enemy' was the circle. So what did the red button do?\n\nI pressed it and the triangle fired a shot. Alright, so that was my weapon.\n\nThe gameplay was childishly easy as the circle made no attempt to evade me. Once it was in my line of sight, I fired, and it vanished from the screen.\n\n'Congratulations!'\n\nThe screen flashed. I got a thousand points for clearing the level, and another thousand because my 'treasure' was intact.\n\nRight, now that I thought about it, the circle was moving towards the gold coin. That was probably what it was programmed to do. \n\nLevel two was similar and I cleared it easily.\n\nIt was on level three that something strange happened. The map was more complex, there were these 'X' marks on the game screen which I couldn't get past, which were most likely meant to be obstacles.\n\nI was still a triangle, but there were two gold coins on screen. This time, pressing the red button did nothing.\n\nI was a bit surprised, but when I look back on that memory- something stands out to me that didn't at the time. There was the icon of an axe. It was in a different room, and I thought I could still shoot, so I ended up wasting my moves going back and forth wondering what was happening. Again, the game didn't give me any additional info that could be helpful.\n\nWhat happened was that the circle caught up to me. I had no clue what to do, so I just sort of ran at it, and my triangle disappeared.\n\n'GAME OVER' came the message on the screen.\n\nI sighed. Again, at the time, there was no real way to know how to play a game other than asking your buddies about it. And my friends were either busy that day or out of town, and it didn't look like anyone else had played the game yet given that it was new.\n\nBefore I could put another quarter in, a message popped up.\n\n'Play Again?'\n\nThat was odd. Games back in the day were designed to suck out as many quarters as possible from you. This was giving me another chance just like that?\n\nI picked 'Yes' for a message to pop up.\n\n'Will You Stake Your Own Treasure?'\n\nI had no idea what that meant, but thought nothing of it as I hit 'Yes.'\n\nI frowned. The map was different from before. Again, hitting the red button did nothing. \n\nHowever, I did see the gun icon in another room. I finally pieced together what I had to do and-\n\n\\-huh?\n\nThe gold coin- my 'treasure' so to speak, was moving. This hadn't happened before. Unsure of what to do, I went for the gun and went ahead with finishing off the circle. \n\nThe gold coin continued to move as I did this, and I was unsure if I was supposed to pick it up or not, but a 'Congratulations!' popped up on screen, and I also got the bonus score for saving my 'treasure', so it looks like what I did was right.\n\nTo my surprise, the game ended at that. It was rather quick if there were only four levels, and at this point I just walked away disappointed, looking for another game to play.\n\nI must've been at the arcade for an hour before the police showed up.\n\nThere had been an incident at my house. A robber had gotten in, thankfully my dad had fetched his gun in time and well... the robber was dead, but both my dad and my little sister were safe, though understandably very shaken.\n\nAll thoughts of the dumb game left my head until more news began coming out about the day.\n\nIt appeared that there had been a string of robberies in the town that day. Mr. Jenkins had his house broken into, and the robber tried to get into his safe before he shot him down, much like my father had.\n\nWhat made my skin crawl though was what happened to Ms. Bertha. I didn't know her at all before the incident, it was when her story became the focus of that night's news that I began to put it all together.\n\nSomeone had broken into her house as well. Only she hadn't been so lucky, and the intruder, after having killed her, had taken her twin babies away. The local police were on high alert searching for them, but to my knowledge, nothing turned up regarding those children till this day.\n\nAnd I wouldn't have thought anything more of it- until the reporter went into the next room.\n\nA room with an axe in it.\n\nNo... it couldn't be...\n\nBut when my father later recounted what had happened to the cops for the twelfth time, saying how he had rushed into the den to fetch his gun, and my sister described how she was pacing around the room in terror, that I realized what had happened.\n\nThe 'gold coins' were treasure, but not just money like with Mr. Jenkins. For Ms. Bertha, it had been her twins, hence the two coins on the screen. For me, it was my little sister.\n\nYou might think that I'm overthinking this- but the thing is that it was highly unusual for there to be a break-in in my town. For there to be three (that I know of, I know there was a fourth level I skipped over but I never found a corresponding incident) in one night... it can't have been a coincidence! \n\nI never was able to find the game at the arcade again. I asked around but no one seemed to remember it.\n\nI honestly would've let the matter rest, but... the thing is that I can't get it out of my mind. I saw the image of Ms. Bertha's dead body on the television, and it's haunted my dreams since then. Many people in my town wondered why she hadn't taken her children and ran, but I had a hunch I knew why. \n\nIt was my fault. I should've picked up on how to play the game earlier- if I had, she might've still been alive. And those children would've grown up living happy, normal lives.\n\nIt's a burden I've been carrying ever since. I just wanted to know though- did this happen to someone else out there? I... I guess I just want to confirm whether my theory is right. That the game *did* cause everything, and that I- was at fault for Ms. Bertha's death. If it turns out that it was just a harmless game that was recalled one day, then I guess I really had nothing to do with it. I guess... my conscience really needs it.",

        "text": "ZUCARI: THE SCARIEST BOARD GAME EVER MADE, read scrawling silver letters across a slim black box.\n\nIt was my 21st birthday. My parents were out of town and I’d invited my two closest friends, Brianna and Elise, over to hang out. We’d been making drinks, watching horror movies… and now opening presents.\n\n“Looks creepy. Is it like *Betrayal at House on the Hill?”* I asked, sliding my fingernail into the seam and breakingt he tape.\n\n“Mmm, more like *Jumanji,*” she replied, swallowing a sip of hard lemonade.\n\nI pulled up the box lid. Inside was a folded board, a deck of cards, a die, and a little baggie of metal game pieces. I slowly unfolded the board—and I had to admit, it was creepy. It depicted a dark forest with towering gnarled trees, and a path of game spaces that twisted and crossed and dead-ended.\n\n\"It’s a pretty standard game. Roll a die. Go that many spaces. Draw a card. Do what the card says. And the game isn't over until someone reaches the cabin.\" Brianna pointed with a purple-lacquered nail to the drawing of a cabin in the far right corner of the board, windows glowing yellow.\n\nI pulled the game pieces out one by one—metal spheres with a dot of colored paint on top. I took red, Elise took green, and Brianna took purple. We put all three on the 'START' square.\n\n\"Why don't you go first, birthday girl?\" Brianna asked. \n\nI took the die, shook it in my cupped hands, and let it fall. 3. I picked up my game piece and moved it three spaces--then reached for the deck and drew a card.\n\n**SOMEONE, OR SOME*****THING*****, IS WATCHING YOU. GO BACK TWO SPACES.**\n\nI lifted my arm to pick up the game piece--and paused.\n\n\"You okay, Cara?\" Elise asked.\n\n\"Yeah. I just...\" I turned around, looking towards the kitchen. I could've sworn... I don't know. It almost felt like a little gust of air on the back of my neck.\n\nI smiled and shook my head. \"You're up,\" I said, handing the die to Elise.\n\n\"Okay...\" she said hesitantly, grabbing the die. 5. She moved her piece five spaces and then drew a card.\n\n\"It says, **YOU FIND WILD RASPBERRIES. GO FORWARD ONE SPACE.**\"\n\nSmiling, she advanced one space on the board—putting her marker in the middle of dark clearing with a small glistening pond. “You’re up,” I said to Brianna.\n\nShe rolled a 2. Drew a card, and read it out loud:\n\n“**CLOUDS ROLL OVER THE MOON. TOO DARK TO SEE. LOSE A TURN.**”\n\nAt that exact moment, the lights flickered.\n\nAnd then they went out.\n\n“Welp. That was weird,” Brianna said in the darkness.\n\n“Was there supposed to be a storm tonight?” Elise asked, her voice tinged with fear. I felt her fingers find my hand in the darkness, then interlock with mine. “Or could… could someone have cut our power?”\n\n“What, you mean, like a murderer?” Brianna asked, barely holding in a laugh.\n\n“I don’t hear any rain or wind or anything. And we *are* three girls, home alone…” She let out a breath. “Did we lock the doors?”\n\n“Elise, it’s okay,” I said, giving her hand a reassuring squeeze. “We get power outages all the time. The wiring out here is shit. Does anyone have their phone? I left mine upstairs.”\n\n“Yeah, I got mine,” Brianna said, rummaging in her pocket.\n\nBut before she could turn on her flashlight, I felt it.\n\nA cool breeze. Wafting over my bare shoulders and through my hair. But the air was different—heavy, cool, damp. An earthy smell filled my nostrils, tinged with decay.\n\n“Do you smell that?” I asked.\n\n“Yeah. Smells like something died,” Elise replied, sounding even more scared.\n\nBut before we could descend into a spiral of panic, white light flashed through the room. Everything was thrown into stark relief from the bright light of Brianna’s flashlight. Black shadows stretched behind us, and our faces took on a sunken, creepy appearance, with black shadows sinking into every dimple, every line.\n\nI looked down—and my breath caught in my throat.\n\nNobody was holding my hand.\n\nElise’s hands were clasped tightly together in her lap.\n\n“Elise… were you holding my hand? Just a minute ago?”\n\n“No, why?”\n\n“Brianna?”\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n“You—this is a joke, right?” I scanned both of their faces, looking for a hint of a smile. “I felt someone holding my hand. This—this isn’t funny, guys.” My heart pounded in my chest and I sucked in a breath. Another breath of that damp, earthy air.\n\n“We weren’t holding your hand, okay? Geez. Chill out,” Brianna said.\n\n“*Somebody* was.”\n\nElise’s eyes went wide. “Maybe—maybe someone broke into the house—”\n\n“You two are so easily scared it’s ridiculous.” Brianna rolled her eyes and handed the die to me. “Your turn.”\n\nI took it from her, a lump forming in my throat. *It had to be Brianna*. She liked to tease people, push their buttons. Exaggerate stories into tall tales, make herself the center of attention. Well, I wouldn’t give her the satisfaction. I put on a brave face, grabbed the die, and rolled it. I moved my piece and then, slowly, plucked a card from the stack.\n\n“**YOU FIND A LOST HIKER. GO BACK THREE SPACES,**” I read, confused. “Why would that be a bad thing?”\n\nBut then I heard it.\n\nA soft shuffling sound, coming from the kitchen.\n\nEvery muscle in my body froze. “Did—did you hear that?” I whispered. Elise nodded at me, her dark eyes wide.\n\nSlowly, I forced myself up.\n\nI started walking towards the kitchen. It was almost pitch black; the light from Brianna’s phone didn’t quite reach. I forced my feet forward, until I was standing at the entrance of the kitchen.\n\nI strained my ears to listen.\n\nI thought all I would hear was silence. That the scuffling sound was just my imagination. But instead, I heard the soft, rhythmic rush of air.\n\n*Breathing.*\n\n“I’m calling the police!” I shouted.\n\nThe light behind me jittered. And then the kitchen lit up in dim tones of gray, as Brianna came up behind me with her flashlight.\n\nI froze.\n\nIn the darkness, in the center of the kitchen, stood a man. He faced away from us, wearing hiking clothes. Something dark—like blood—covered his bare legs in patches.\n\nMy legs felt weak underneath me. I gripped the doorframe—\n\n“Are you okay?”\n\nI looked back to see Brianna and Elise behind me. But they didn’t look scared. I whipped around—but now, the kitchen was empty.\n\n“You—did you see—there was a man—”\n\n“I didn’t see anything,” Elise said.\n\nI ran through the house, Brianna and Elise behind me. But the doors were all still locked. I opened the pantry and looked under the sofa; there was no one down here. And I definitely hadn’t heard anyone go up the stairs.\n\nI guess… it had been dark. Maybe my brain interpreted some of the shapes and shadows of the kitchen as someone standing there. I *was* on edge. Brianna’s prank had really messed with my head.\n\nWe finally sat back down at the game board. “Are you sure you want to keep playing?” Brianna asked.\n\nI hated her tone. Like she was talking to a scared little child. “Of course I want to keep playing. Why wouldn’t I?”\n\n“You just seem a little… jumpy.”\n\nThe dark, harsh shadows of her face scrunched into a smile. I grabbed the die off the board and handed it to Elise. “Your turn.”\n\nShe glanced between us for a second, then hesitantly took the die. “One,” she said, moving her green marker one space. Then she drew a card.\n\n“**WHILE TAKING A SWIM IN THE POND, YOU FEEL SOMETHING GRAB YOUR ANKLE. LOSE A TURN.**” Elise lifted her piece and moved it back. She started for the die—\n\n*Drip.*\n\nThe three of us turned our heads to the foyer. *Drip.* A faucet was dripping—which sometimes happened when the power went out. Our well had an old electric pump that’d seen better days. “I’ll get it,” I said, hoisting myself up and walking into the dark foyer.\n\nBrianna and Elise followed, the flashlight bouncing off the dark walls.\n\nIt didn’t sound like it was coming from the kitchen, so I poked my head into the hall bathroom. Not there either. Which left only one option: my parents’ bathroom. Their bedroom was the only one on the first floor.\n\nI made my way into the dark hallway, Brianna and Elise following a few steps behind. The dripping grew louder. I swung the door to the bathroom open. *Drip, drip, drip.* It was coming from the bathtub.\n\nI walked over, slowly, pulled the shower curtain back—\n\nAnd froze.\n\nThe bathtub was full of water.\n\nIt glistened in the darkness, Brianna’s flashlight reflecting on the water. “My… my mom must’ve forgotten to drain it,” I said, staring down into the water. But I knew, deep down, that couldn’t be right. My mom used all kinds of bath bombs and fragrant soaps. The water here was odorless, crystal clear.\n\nI got on my knees and plunged my hand into the water, reaching for the stopper.\n\nIt was ice cold. I grimaced as I plunged my hand in further, reaching for the little ring on the stopper, curling my finger to hook into it. The cold felt like little knives across my skin, stabbing me everywhere. I reached deeper—\n\n“No!”\n\nElise grabbed my shoulders and pulled me back.\n\nI rolled back onto the tile, ice-cold water dripping down my arm, onto my shirt. “There—there was something in there,” she panted. Her lips trembled as she stared at the bathtub.\n\n“What the hell are you talking about?” Brianna asked.\n\n“I saw something, okay?” Elise shot back, with a bite in her voice I’d never heard before. “Don’t you dare tell me I didn’t. There was something dark. Moving under the water. It looked like it was going right for Cara and I—”\n\n“Okay. Okay.” Brianna held up her hands in surrender. “I’m not going to fight you on it. Let’s just go back into the family room, okay?”\n\nShe stepped over me, reached down, and quickly pulled the stopper out of the bathtub. A little tornado appeared in the water, followed by the sound of water rushing and gurgling through the pipes. Then she stepped out of the bathroom.\n\nElise and I followed. But as I stepped out of the room… I could’ve sworn I heard a splash.\n\n“I lost my turn with the whole moon thing, so it’s Cara’s turn again,” Brianna said, sitting back down on the carpet in front of the board.\n\nI sat down, eyeing Elise and Brianna hesitantly. Then I picked up the die and rolled it. Moved my game piece, picked a card off the stack and read it aloud.\n\n“**WHILE HUNTING FOR FOOD, YOU HIT THE WRONG TARGET. LOSE A TURN.**”\n\n*SPLAT.*\n\nSomething dark and wet fell onto the dead center of the board.\n\n“What… what is that?” Brianna asked. For the first time, she sounded scared.\n\nI slowly tilted my head and looked up.\n\nThere was a dark stain in the middle of the ceiling. With every second it grew larger. As if something upstairs, right above us, was quickly bleeding out into the floor.\n\nI grabbed Elise and stared at the stain, too scared to move.\n\n“We need to get out of here—”\n\n*Clack.*\n\nBrianna had already rolled her die. She grabbed a card; then it slipped out of her hands, falling onto the board and soaking into the blood.\n\n“**THE MUSHROOMS WERE POISONOUS. GO BACK TO START.**”\n\nAnd then she began to retch. Horrible, choking coughs filled the room as she doubled over. She crawled forward across the carpet and began to vomit. “Call 911!” I screamed at Elise, as I grabbed her by the shoulders and tried to hold her up, try to keep her from choking on it.\n\nElise pulled out her phone. “There’s no reception!” she cried, fingers frantically moving over the screen. “*No reception!”*\n\nBrianna’s body lurched in my arms as she threw up again. Vomit spilled over the carpet, threaded with blood.\n\nAnd then she was still.\n\n“Oh my God. Brianna? *Brianna?!”*\n\nI grabbed her phone and started to dial 911, its flashlight bouncing all over the room. But Elise was right—the call didn’t even connect. *No network.*\n\nI motioned to Elise. Each of us put Brianna’s arm over our shoulders and we began to hoist her up. “You’re going to be okay,” I said softly. “We’re going to take you to the hospital—”\n\n“We have to keep playing,” she said weakly, bloodstained vomit dripping down her chin. “We have to… reach the cabin…”\n\n“Okay, we’ll keep playing,” I said in a calm voice, exchanging a look with Elise. “But first we’re just going to get you checked up—”\n\n“*LISTEN TO ME!”* she screamed, her voice hoarse.\n\nElise and I froze.\n\n“We have to keep playing. We have to reach the cabin.” She tore away from us, breathing hard, wavering on unsteady feet. “This isn’t just some game. Zucari is—it’s fucked up. I only brought it here because Dave forced me to. He was going to—to hurt me if I didn’t.”\n\n*SPLAT.*\n\nAnother drop of dark liquid splattered onto the game board.\n\n“If we don’t reach the cabin—if we don’t finish the game—we all die.”\n\nShe collapsed back down into the carpet, breathing hard. Then with a shaking, vomit-covered hand, she grabbed the die. “Cara… your turn.” She held it out to me.\n\nI paused, staring at the die.\n\nThen I shook my head. “I don’t know what the fuck is going on here, but I’m out.” And with that, I turned on my heel and marched straight for the front door.\n\nBut it wouldn’t open.\n\n“What the fuck?”\n\nI tugged at the door with all my might. It didn’t budge. With a scream, I grabbed my mom’s expensive vase off the front table and threw it at the window.\n\nIt shattered to a million pieces—but the window didn’t even crack.\n\n“Maybe… we should just finish the game.”\n\nI whirled around to see Elise standing behind me. She stared at me with wide, dark eyes. “Please, Cara,” she whispered. “I don’t want to die.”\n\n“We’re not going to die. This is just some stupid prank—”\n\n“Then why can’t we open the door? Why can’t we *call* anyone?!”\n\nI looked at the door, my heart sinking.\n\nThen I slowly walked back towards the family room.\n\nThe smell of decay had intensified. Damp, cold air clung to my skin. I stepped into the room and—*crunch—*something was under my feet. I looked down to see a few dried leaves, laying on top of the carpet.\n\nAnd that’s when I noticed the room was… different.\n\nA pale, yellow moon hung outside the window—even though by this hour, it should have been high in the sky. A green lichen bloomed on the rough, gray upholstery of the sofa. The blind cords hung down to the floor like vines, and the mass of tangled cords that ran to the TV looked more like roots twisted around each other.\n\nI swallowed and sat across from Brianna. Without a word, I took the die. Let it fall drew my card. I let out a sigh of relief.\n\n“**YOU CROSS A STREAM AND STOP FOR A DRINK. GO FORWARD TWO SPACES.**”\n\nI advanced my game piece, then handed the die—now coated in a thin layer of vomit and blood—to Elise. I could feel her hand shake shake as she took it from me.\n\n*Clack. Thwip.*\n\nElise’s eyes widened as she stared at the card. She opened her mouth—but no words came out. Just a horrible, choking sound.\n\nAnd then I heard it.\n\nA sound I’ve only ever heard once before in my life, more than a decade ago. But filled me with absolute terror.\n\nA soft, rattling sound.\n\nComing from the corner of the room.\n\nElise slowly turned her card around, and I saw the words: **RATTLESNAKE ATTACK. GO BACK TO START.**\n\nA soft slithering sound echoed across the room. Elise scrambled back, climbing up onto the sofa. I glanced down at the carpet in the dim light, trying to pinpoint the snake’s location.\n\nBut it wasn’t carpet anymore.\n\nWet muck covered with decaying, damp leaves. Twisted roots and jagged rocks. The slithering sound grew louder and I froze, staring into the darkness, in the direction of the sound—\n\n“Cara…” Brianna choked. “You have to finish the game.”\n\nI glanced at the board. I was seven spaces away from the cabin. Just a few more turns and I could make it to the cabin.\n\nI snatched the die. It stuck to my fingers, staining my fingers red. I let it go and it tumbled across the painted trees.\n\n3.\n\n*Shit.* I’d have to roll a five or six to make it next turn.\n\nI snatched the card from the top of the deck—and all the blood drained out of my face. **IT’S BEHIND YOU. GO BACK ONE SPACE.**\n\nI immediately felt warm breath on the back of my neck. I squeezed my eyes tight, trying not to imagine what ‘it’ was. But I’d seen a shadow, in my peripheral vision, stretching out behind me. A shadow with long, spindly arms—reaching out for me—\n\n*Sssshhhhh.*\n\nThe rattling sound jolted me back into action. It was loud—only several feet away from me. Elise was crumpled into the couch, crying. Brianna was retching. I grabbed the die, shook it, and let it fall.\n\n6.\n\nRelief flooded me. I grabbed my red game piece and dropped it on the cabin. *Clack.* I looked up at Elise, shaking and staring at me; and Brianna, pale and trembling, lying on the floor.\n\nBut they were alive.\n\nAnd there was only silence.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWe never spoke of Zucari again.\n\nOver the coming months Brianna, Elise, and I grew apart. After graduation, Elise went on to get her bachelor’s. Brianna left Dave and got a job in the city. I stayed here, living with my parents as I continued at the IT company I’d been interning with.\n\nBut over the past few weeks, I’ve been seeing things.\n\nLike a few days ago, I woke up in the middle of the night—and saw a man in bloodstained hiking clothes, facing away from me, standing still in my hallway.\n\nOr when I took a bath to unwind from a particularly hard day at work—and felt something brush my ankle.\n\nOr when I felt a gust of warm breath on the back of my neck as I made myself dinner.\n\nAnd then there was last night. I woke up in the middle of the night, around 4 AM… and saw something outside that made my blood run cold.\n\nA golden light, shining through the window of an old, abandoned cabin.\n\nAnd what Brianna said echoed in my mind—\n\n*The game isn't over until you reach the* [cabin.](http://www.reddit.com/r/blairdaniels)",

You asked me to come here. You practically begged me. And here I am, hundreds of miles from home, risking my job. And you're playing dumb? What's the point?’\n\nThen she got that look. The one she always got when we were kids. When she knew the bad things were about to happen. \n\n‘I think we should leave.’ I said.\n\n‘Max is ill. I can’t just leave him. He’s my husband.’\n\nI wanted to punch her stupid husband.\n\n‘Jesus, May, he looks like he’s about to die. We can drive to town and send an ambulance back to get him. I’m not suggesting we just leave him here to die.’\n\n‘No,’ she said, with an authority in her voice I had never heard before.\n\n‘Fine. We don't have to go. Yet. But can we at least go for a walk? I need to get outside, and by the looks of it you've not seen the sun in weeks.’\n\nShe smiled. ‘Sun in Scotland? That's ambitious. Let me grab my coat.’\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n‘Not that way,’ she said.\n\nI was heading for the north woods, our favorite place to go walking together.\n\n‘You love that hike!’ I said.\n\n‘No,’ she said, refusing to look at me. ‘I don't want to. Let's just take the path to the road.’\n\n‘What’s the problem?’\n\nShe rounded on me, eyes wild, teeth clenched. Her whole face was like a bright red warning to shut the fuck up.\n\nShe actually reminded me a little of you, Christopher. I’d never seen her like that before.\n\n‘Just fucking drop it, Sam. I swear to god. I don't want to go traipsing about for hours in a fucking freezing forest with you. We are taking the path or I am going home. OK?’\n\nI just nodded, feeling nauseated and confused.\n\n‘Also, you have to leave tonight. Straight after dinner. I’m sorry, but Max and I are going away tomorrow. On holiday. We have things to work out.’\n\nThat was out of the blue. She had never mentioned a holiday before. I wanted to ask what she meant but the tension was thick. So instead, we walked in silence, crunching footsteps and shallow breaths the only sounds. I felt like a void had opened up. Like the ground had cracked between us and the two parts were moving away in opposite directions. She wasn’t acting like herself.\n\n'Sorry,' she said, eventually. 'I'm just scared. You know, like, I've always felt afraid. My whole life. All that stuff with dad and then with Brian, I've never really not worried. But it's actually different this time. It's somehow worse. Like, unbelievably worse.'\n\n'Please tell me what's going on, May.'\n\nShe stopped walking and took a deep breath. Her face went through some kind of process at that moment. I couldn’t put my finger on it at the time, but now I think she was organizing things in her head. Detangling events so that she could tell me only what she felt comfortable with. I did realize later that she wasn't telling me the full story, but I was okay with it. Some things are too difficult to share.\n\n'Max cheated on me with a schoolgirl.'\n\nI stopped dead. 'What. The. Fuck.'\n\n'I actually found out from the girl. I was walking through town and a bunch of them stopped me, all clearly younger than 18, by the way, and they said that Max doesn't like ‘dusty old cunts’. He prefers them fresh.' She shook her head. 'It's almost funny. Anyway, I didn't believe it at the time. Who would? Who wants to believe their husband is a sexual predator? But then one day he left home just 20 minutes before the local school got out. And I followed him.'\n\nShe looked me dead in the eye. 'I saw them, Sammy. Down an alley. They weren't doing anything but it's not like I stayed long enough to watch. I already knew the truth. There's no other explanation for him being there.'\n\nAn adulterer, a narcissist, and a fucking predator. I wanted to kill the bastard.\n\nI waited for more, but she was done. I was confused. The news was devastating. Humiliating. But May looked petrified. There had to be something more than just the cheating going on.\n\nBut she wasn’t going to say any more.\n\n'He's a bad person, May. I've always known it. Why won’t you just leave him?'\n\n'He is my husband. He made a mistake. I can't go through another divorce, Sammy, I am 36. I’m not young anymore, and I definitely don't have the looks. What's the point in living if I don’t have a husband?'\n\nClassic May. Marriage is the meaning of life. And I know exactly where that idea comes from. I can still hear those words, Christopher. They haunt me. What she heard repeated to her, day in, day out, in that fucking house; it destroyed her. \n\n*'Find a husband as soon as you possibly can, girls. A man to please. You won’t be fertile for long, and a barren bitch is a useless bitch.'*\n\nTruth is, the only constant in May’s whole life was abusive men, right from the moment she was old enough to understand what a man is. Her self-esteem wasn't just damaged; it was destroyed. Blown to bits and swept away—nothing left behind but that one conviction: you must be a good little wife, or you may as well die.\n\nI don't know why we turned out so different; why she internalized that message while I railed against it. But if Max's unfaithfulness, his sexual deviance, wouldn’t snap her out of it, then I would just have to drag her out.\n\n'We need to go to the police.' I said.\n\n'Please don’t say that, Sammy. He's better now. That's what I was going to tell you. Something has changed.'\n\n'Didn't look that way last night when his creepy ass was chasing me down the stairs.'\n\n'That's not what happened. Just wait. I’ll make him come to dinner. You haven’t even spent any time with him. You'll see. Besides, the police won't do anything. He's not committed a crime because the girl is over 16.'\n\n'I’m not sure about that, but fine. I’ll give him one chance. But if I’m not convinced, I’m dragging you out of this house myself. Kicking and screaming, if necessary.'\n\nShe nodded.\n\n'But,' I said. 'Something isn’t adding up here. I get that he cheated on you, but the other day you were on about his mental health. And why does he look like a zombie?'\n\n'Let's go back,' she said. 'It's getting cold.'\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n'Hi, Sammy.'\n\nThe dining room smelled of roasting meat and spices, and May clattered around in the kitchen with dishes and cutlery. Max sat in a chair at the head of the table, barely visible, except when touched by the flickering light of the fireplace. I didn’t bother replying to him.\n\n'Sit down,' he said. 'May’s making chicken.'\n\nI sat as far away as possible. Even in the half-light, I could see the sickly green hue of his skin. I didn’t think he was contagious. After all, he’d been staying with May and she was fine, but I still didn’t want to be near him.\n\n'What do you know of the Highlands, Samantha?'\n\n'It’s Sam.'\n\nHe smiled again. 'What do you know of the Highlands, *Sam*?'\n\n'Not a lot.'\n\n‘A shame, but not surprising. A city girl like you would never understand. This place sings to me. I feel it in my bones. On my skin. Augmenting my body, making me powerful.’\n\nI rolled my eyes. 'Whatever, Shakespeare. You’re not well.'\n\n'I’ve never felt better, actually.'\n\n'You have green skin and you’re talking nonsense.'\n\nHe snorted. 'You should go home, Sam.'\n\n'I will. And I’ll take May, too.'\n\nHe shook his head. 'I know what your game is. You think you’re here to save her.’ He leaned forward, his voice lowering. ‘But you already had your chance to save her, didn’t you? All those years ago. She was just a little girl, and he was hurting her.”\n\nI felt sick. How did he know? Had May told him? Was that what she thought too?\n\n‘You should have done something, Sam,’ he continued. ‘Should have told the police. A teacher. But instead, you left. You ran off and abandoned her. And the saddest part is, even when you were there, you should have been the target. Not her. But you couldn’t even do that right.’\n\n'You don’t know what the fuck you’re talking about.'\n\n'You know it’s true. If you hadn’t been such an ugly—'\n\n'Shut up.'\n\n'—graceless—'\n\n'I will genuinely punch you.'\n\n'—manly—'\n\n“Stop!”\n\n'—wretch—'\n\nI stood up.\n\n'—then perhaps he would have taken you instead.'\n\nI realized I was crying. On a rational level, I knew that what he said was unfair. I was a child. I never abused May. How could it be my fault? But there was still something buried in me, a guilt, a shame, that Max had wrenched up.\n\nMay flew into the room, hands red and soapy, eyes wide. 'What’s all the shouting about?'\n\nI looked at her, and then back to Max. He watched me, a smirk on his face. I couldn’t look at him for another second.  'Nothing,' I said. 'I’m going for a smoke.'\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe yard was covered in snow. My cigarettes were in the car, parked by the southern treeline of the woods. I wasn’t allowed to bring them into the house.\n\nThere was a light in the trees. You know when you see something that is typically so innocuous, but it is presenting itself in a whole new way? You feel like you should recognize what you're looking at—like the answer is there but your brain hasn't quite caught up. That's what it felt like seeing those lights.\n\nThey were floating, but I couldn’t see anything holding them up. They looked like candle flames, but bigger, and instead of orange, they were golden. Three of them.\n\nAnd I loved them.\n\nI felt warm looking at them, and I knew I’d stumbled upon something special. Something completely new. Something the world had never seen before, but now they would because of me. I found them. They were mine.\n\nI’m trying to accurately recount my emotions at the time. I still remember the experience clearly; one of the few things in this story I don’t need to think too hard about. And I know now, looking back, that my reaction was unusual. Floating lights in the forest at night? I should have walked away. Or recorded it. Or shouted May. Something other than what I did.\n\nBut instead, I walked towards them. They danced in the air like fireworks, leaving trails of light behind. And I could hear them too; a faint musical murmur. Beautiful. And cute! Like the sound of a baby animal.\n\n'What are you?' I said. And they laughed. And it was pure joy. And I followed them, deeper into the woods, not caring that it was so dark, so late, so cold. These were my new friends, my loves, and I had to know where they were taking me. Would there be more there? I was praying for it.\n\nWe arrived at a small loch. The lights danced out over it, their golden dazzle reflecting on the surface of the water. I wanted to touch them. I was ready to swim for the opportunity. I took a step forward.\n\nMy foot squelched in something cold and slimy.\n\nAll at once, the lights dove into the water. Their brilliance disappeared as if a switch had been flicked, and then I couldn’t see a thing.\n\nReality came rushing back. What was I doing? I was alone, far from home, surrounded by trees and snow and water and the deep black of a remote Highlands night.\n\nAnd whatever was beneath my feet.\n\nI took a step back. As my shoe came away, so did some of the substance, and a foul stench, like spoiled meat and shit, came away with it. I almost gagged, but a whisper of crunching snow nearby put a terror in me so intense it shocked me into stillness.\n\nI froze, the darkness gathering around me like a cloak. There was no sound but my own suppressed breathing. Then, as if they had been waiting for me to stop and pay attention, the lights burst back up out of the loch and the area was again awash in their glow.\n\nBut it wasn’t the same as before. In place of the warm golden color, there was now a sickly green. I immediately thought of Max, of his skin, and although I didn’t understand anything at that moment, faint connections were forming in my brain and panic was seizing at my chest. Instinctively I stepped back. My feet collided again with something soft and slimy, but this time I slipped, fell and landed at eye level with a sight that shredded the last few slivers of my composure.\n\nThree black dogs. Bellies cut. Guts spilled. Eyes shriveled and sightless.\n\nIt took a few moments before I realized I was screaming. And then I noticed another sound, a new chorus, joining. The lights. I somehow knew it was them, like I had known before with their faint murmuring, but the sound now was something different. I don’t know if they were words or just guttural, awful sounds, but I can still hear them to this day.\n\n*coo shee rook ich uh ree ishd*\n\nOver and over, these strange sounds emanated from the green orbs spinning above the lake. Alongside the stink of the dogs and the threat of whatever thing whispered and rustled in the dark, I felt fear like I never had before. \n\nAnd then I saw HER. \n\nShe stood naked, a tornado of snow swirling around her, patches of ice stuck to her skin. And her eyes, even bathed as they were in the green light of the flames, blazed blue from behind her matted fringe.\n\nThe lights changed their song.\n\n*ka lee ach ka lee ach ka lee ach*\n\nIt echoed through the whole forest. It must have been audible for miles. And it felt so dark, so WRONG. I couldn't stand it. At that moment I knew, more than I had ever known anything, that if I didn’t move, I would die.\n\nI sprinted through the trees, but that demented fucking song never got any quieter. I could hear footsteps at my heels, unhurried, but constantly there, no matter how far I ran. I had the sense I was being toyed with. The chanting got louder.\n\n*coo shee rook ich uh ree ishd coo shee rook ich uh ree ishd coo shee rook ich uh ree ishd coo shee rook ich uh ree ishd coo shee rook ich uh ree ishd coo shee rook ich uh ree ishd coo shee rook ich uh ree ishd coo shee rook ich uh ree ishd coo shee rook ich uh ree ishd ka lee ach ka lee ach ka lee ach ka lee ach ka lee ach ka lee ach KA LEE ACH KA LEE ACH KA LEE ACH*\n\nAs they reached the highest note, my head screaming with the agony of it, a howl ripped through the air. Reflexively, I looked behind me. My foot caught on something hard and I slammed into the ground.\n\nI remember there was no pain, just cold. Nothing was broken, I know that now, but I still couldn’t move. I can’t be sure but I think she was behind that. Some kind of fucking spell or something. Which leads me to believe she could have paralyzed me at any moment, and letting me run at all was just her idea of a cruel joke.\n\nThe footsteps stopped behind my head.\n\n'You shouldn’t have come here. I warned you.' Her voice burned like ice. And it echoed, though whether through the whole forest or just in my head, I don’t know.\n\nI couldn’t speak. Couldn’t move. So I just held my breath, prayed to a God I didn’t believe in and waited to die.\n\n'But,' she said. 'Your love for the woman runs deep. The man is mine; he was given willingly.'\n\nGiven?\n\n'You can still save your sister if she is smart enough to accept. I will give you that chance. But be quick. You don't have long. And when I come to claim my *coo shee*, I will take everything left in that house.'\n\nAnd that’s the last thing I remember from the forest.\n\nMay shook me awake. I was lying on the ground in front of her house, frozen.\n\n'Where have you been?' she asked. 'Max is out looking for you.'\n\n'I don’t know. Something is going on here.'\n\nMay frowned. But not in a confused way, or even a curious way. Just a worried one. 'We have to get inside. Come on.'\n\n'No,' I said. 'We have to leave. Now.'\n\n'Just come on. We can talk more once we’re warm. It’s freezing out here.'\n\nShe hooked an arm around mine and pulled me into the house. When I was warmed up, coffee in hand, May sat next to me on the couch and began to cry.\n\n'I’m so sorry, Sammy.'\n\nReflexively, I leaned into her but stopped short after seeing the look on her face. I knew immediately what this moment was. She was opening up, unfolding for the first time since I arrived. And that’s when I realized that she hadn’t shown any surprise at all, not at anything I said. I told her this fantastical story about lights and dead dogs and an old woman caked in ice, and the whole time she had barely blinked.\n\n'I don't know how to tell you this,' she said through sobs. 'Honestly, I wasn't going to tell you. But I saw them, too; the lights. I saw you follow them into the woods. I ran out, and I called after you, but you didn't hear me. It was like you were in a trance.'\n\nI already had so many questions, but I sensed now was the time for listening. So I just nodded.\n\nShe went on, collecting herself a little. 'I honestly don't know what those lights were. I promise you that. And if I had ever thought you were in any danger, I wouldn't have asked you to come here. To the house. But whatever they were, I do know where they took you. I'm almost certain of it. I mean… who they took you to.'\n\nMy stomach clenched. 'You’ve seen her too.'\n\nMay nodded through fresh tears. \n\n'I've never been so scared in my life, May. I could have died out there. I was alone, freezing, in the middle of the night, with some fucking… whatever the fuck it is, following me. And you’re telling me now that you’ve seen it before? And not only that, but you sent Max to find me? Max, who is the reason I am here, who is clearly clinically fucking insane, and who chased me around your house the other night? You sent him?'\n\nShe was fully crying now, her chest heaving. She wailed words at me but I could barely make them out. Seeing the pain she was in, the complete despair, softened me a little. I took her hand. 'Jesus. Alright. It’s okay, May. I’m sorry. I just want to know what’s going on.'\n\nIt took some time, but she calmed down. 'This whole thing is my fault.'\n\n'No, it's not.'\n\nShe raised her eyes to me. 'It is. I made Max sick. I haven’t told you everything.'\n\nI waited.\n\n'After I found out Max was cheating, I went for a walk in the woods. Our walk. But I went further than I ever have, and I came to this Loch. The same place she took you. Please understand. I was distraught. Terrified. All my life, I've been with these men who hurt me, who end up hating me. I don't know what I am doing wrong, and I can't seem to fix it, no matter how good a wife I try to be.'\n\nI couldn’t see how any of that was relevant. I opened my mouth, but she stopped me.\n\n'I was going to throw myself into the water. I didn't know what would happen. If I would just float there, drown, get swept away somewhere. I didn't really care either. That's when I texted you; that weird text you freaked out about. I was in a bad place. But before I could do anything, she appeared. That woman.'\n\nI thought back to a few weeks before. May had sent me a message. Something like: 'I love you and I’m sorry for everything'. I called her 16 times over the course of two hours before she picked up. I was already in my car on the way to Scotland. I had turned back home in a blind rage when she said everything was fine and I should just forget it.\n\nMay took a sip of her coffee, grimaced, and then went into the kitchen. She came back with two bottles of wine. No glasses.\n\n'She actually sounded like you at first. Said it wasn't my fault. That it was the men who were at fault. Blah blah blah.' She took a big gulp. 'But then she told me she could fix Max. All I had to do was agree to it.'\n\n'How could she fix him?'\n\n'I thought the same. I told her to leave me alone to die. She said fine and stood back. Then I did it. I threw myself into the water.'\n\nBut nothing happened. When May was due to hit the icy surface, she instead found herself standing up, back in the same position as before. She tried again, but the same happened. And the whole time, the woman laughed at her.\n\n'I asked her what was going on. She shrugged and said ‘the Lochs take only their own’. I don't know. She said I might ‘procure some rope and try a tree’ but by that point I was furious. I wanted to punch the smirk right off her face. But then she asked me again if I would accept her help. I don't know why I agreed this time. Maybe it was the fact something impossible had just happened to me, or maybe my mania had just taken over. But either way, I agreed. And she said fine, and to wait there, while she prepared the ritual.'\n\nThe woman came back moments later followed by three black dogs. They were like nothing May had ever seen; huge, snarling beasts with thick teeth jutting out from behind black, leathery lips. And their faces were grotesque, too. Eyes like dark tunnels.\n\n'Before I continue, please know I already hate myself for this more than anybody else ever could. It might have been the woman influencing me, or because the dogs were so disturbing to look at… or maybe I'm just a shitty person. Either way, she handed me a knife and told me to cut the dogs’ throats. She said I had already seen her magic at work, and that she absolutely could 'fix' Max, but only if I did exactly what she said.'\n\nMay took another gulp of wine. And then another. 'I don't have an excuse for any of this. Not a good enough one, anyway. But I was desperate, alone, and afraid, and this woman had already demonstrated some power I couldn't understand. I thought she could really save me and Max. I truly did. And the dogs were horrible things. It made me cringe to look at them. I just couldn’t stop myself.'\n\nI felt sick. 'You killed three animals. Three living things. That’s not you.'\n\nShe slammed the bottle on the table. 'Is it not? What the fuck do you know about me anyway? We live in different countries, Sam. And I am so fucking tired of being this pathetic little woman. Nobody has ever loved me, no matter how hard I try. Instead, they beat me and humiliate me. I am so fundamentally fucking broken. She offered me a way out, a way to keep my husband. To fix him. To make him LOVE me. So yes, I did it. I won’t die alone, Sam. I refuse.'\n\nEverything she said, I had heard before. The lessons she learned in that house. It’s all her fault; never the men who hit her, degrade her or cheat on her. I felt the same old reassurances coming to my lips, but I held back. They never worked. 'Okay…' I put up my hands. 'Okay. Just tell me what happened next.'\n\nShe sighed. 'She made me drag the bodies into the loch. Then I was to wait until the blood had turned the water red. It was so strange. It was freezing outside, but the water actually started to get hot. I thought I was going to be boiled alive… She told me to say Max’s name over and over. I can remember now what she said, and I hate myself for not picking up on it at the time. It was maybe too late anyway.'\n\n'What did she say?'\n\n'‘Call his name and give him to me’.' She shrugged. 'And that’s what I did.'\n\nSam slumped in her chair. She lifted the bottle to her lips again but realized it was empty. She opened the second one. \n\nI wanted to comfort her, but I knew there was nothing I could say. I had seen that woman myself, whatever she was. If May truly had given her permission to do something to Max, then what could we do about it? We didn’t even know what we were dealing with, let alone how to stop it. \n\n'Is that when he started to change?' I said.\n\n'Yes. A few days after it happened, he disappeared. That was the first night he went out. When he came back, he seemed happy, although there was something different about him. Like, not quite right. He said ‘the woman in the woods is going to make me strong’.' May spat out a laugh, which startled me. 'She was right, by the way. I did get him back. He’s not looked at that stupid little girl since. Now he only has plans for me.'\n\n'What do you mean? What plans?'\n\nShe stared at the wine bottle. 'You have to go now. I shouldn’t have asked you to come at all. I was just so scared.'\n\nShe was closing up again. I started to panic. 'No, May, listen. Whatever happened here, it doesn’t matter. You can still get out.'\n\nShe was shaking her head.\n\n'Look,' I said, 'that woman. She said Max can’t be saved, but you can. We can just walk out of here. It’s that easy. Just come with me.'\n\nShe gazed over at the window. I barely heard her next words. 'I don’t think I want to leave.'\n\n'What?'\n\nShe looked at me. Her eyes were spilling over, but there was also something like relief on her face. 'I can’t do it anymore, Sammy. I couldn’t bear to be alone again. For all Max’s faults, I know that he loves me. He promised that we’ll be together forever.'\n\n'That is fucking madness. Get your shit and come with me. I’m serious, now.'\n\nShe shook her head. 'You won’t ever get it.'\n\n'What the fuck? How do I not get it?'\n\nYou will want to stop reading. Don’t. You’re almost at the end. \n\n'Because,' she said, after downing the last of the wine. 'It wasn’t you, was it? He didn’t touch you every night. He didn’t creep into your bedroom at 2 am, shake you awake, and call you a slut, a whore, or tell you you deserved everything you got. You didn’t spend all those fucking nights praying that the house would burn down with him and you in it. You didn’t feel any of that, Sam. You just left.'\n\n'May—'\n\n'I know it’s not fair. I know he hurt you sometimes too. And I know that you feel guilty anyway, and you’ve spent all these years trying to make it up to me. Running down here every single time to clean up my messes. Risking your job. And I took full advantage of that, didn’t I? I used you and your guilt and some days I can’t even look at myself in the fucking mirror without screaming. And I know how wrong he was, Sammy. I do. I know that it’s okay to be alone and that it’s okay to be a woman without a man. But even though I know all that, I still feel utterly worthless without one. And I know Max is my last chance. So please just let me go with him. Live your life. Without me around to hold you back, you can make something of yourself. Be somebody. I really believe that.'\n\nI was crying now too. 'Please stop. You know I can’t leave without you.'\n\n'I won’t go.'\n\n'Then we both die.'\n\nShe slapped me, her face twisted with rage and pain into something gruesome. I was scared. Not of her, not of what she might do to me or what she had already done; but of the looming possibility that I really had lost her forever. But then it all melted away, and she started to cry again.\n\n'I am doing this for you, too,' she said. 'I want you to be free of me.'\n\n'But I don’t want to be free of you. I want to help you.'\n\nShe got up from the couch.\n\n'Where are you going?' I asked.\n\nShe smiled at me. 'To pack.'\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nMay and I got to the car 30 minutes later. The whole time I was looking over my shoulder, close to madness at the thought of Max returning. But we made it. And May looked better already. She walked with shoulders back, head up, like all those lies she’d been telling herself had been twisting her spine and now she was free of them. \n\nFor the first time since her call the other day, I also felt relaxed. And optimistic about the future. We would be okay, and this time I wasn’t going to let her run off with anyone else until I had thoroughly vetted them. I hated the thought of babying her but clearly, that’s what she needed. She almost fucking killed herself.\n\nI got into the car and started the engine. The windows were frosted up, and I didn’t want to wait the time it would take for them to clear up from the heat, so I reached into the glovebox to grab the scraper.\n\nMay wasn’t getting into the car.\n\nI realized immediately how stupid I’d been. All that stuff about her seeming more upright, more at peace with herself. It wasn’t because she’d let go of her demons. It was because she’d accepted them.\n\nI scrambled out of the car and turned towards the house.\n\nThere were two figures by the open front door; black silhouettes against the hallway light. One male, hunched, diminished. The other was my sister. My beautiful, broken sister.\n\nHer head turned to me one last time, and I sprinted towards her. But I was too far away. She took Max’s hand, and together they walked back through the door and locked it behind them.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI don’t know how long I spent screaming at the house. I tried to call 999, but of course, there was no service. Then I spent an eternity with my head pressed into the cold rubber of the steering wheel, sobbing uncontrollably.\n\nFinally, with nothing else to do, I drove away.\n\nI returned two hours later with a police car. I told them May was in imminent danger. By that point, the front door was unlocked, but the house was empty. Nothing was disturbed or stolen: no sign of struggle at all. To the police, it looked like they had both simply up and left of their own accord. No crime committed. They weren’t happy with me at all.\n\nAfter a few days, though, and with Max’s own family reporting that he hadn’t contacted them, the police opened a missing persons case. It never went anywhere. I gave them as much information as I could, but I had to withhold huge parts of the real story. They would have just thought me crazy.\n\nIn the end, though, I realized it didn’t matter. Case or no case. Wherever she was, she was beyond the reach of humanity. And now I have to live in a world where I not only know that there are demons like that woman out there but also where I know that my sister, my May, is in the clutches of one. And who knows what is happening to her right now? Who knows what pain she is feeling? What torture?\n\nWhen I began writing this letter, I was just trying to get some closure. But as I approached the end, I had something like an epiphany.\n\nLast week I packed up my car. Booked a hotel up north in Scotland. And I went on a hike.\n\nIt took me a while, but I found that loch again. And the woman too. She called me a fool for returning and explained that I had my chance to save May and I failed. I knew all of that though. That’s not why I was there.\n\nI didn’t know how it worked. It was all a shot in the dark, to be honest. But what else did I have to lose?\n\nI performed the ritual. I killed the dogs. I stepped into the bloody water.\n\nAnd I gave her your name.\n\nI know you probably don’t believe any of this, but I don’t care. You’ll find out soon enough. At the beginning of this letter, I told you you were in danger. And now, at the end, I have the pleasure of telling you it is all because of me.

        "text": "**CW: Child abuse, suicidal thoughts, animal abuse**\n\n*I posted a small part of this letter a couple of months ago but it was too painful for me to finish. It’s reposted here now, in full, with links to all the parts because the text is too long. I hope the difference is significant enough to allow that, but I understand if it’s taken down.*\n\n*Apologies if I don’t reply to comments, the hurt is still raw.*\n\n*This is my closure.*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nHi, Christopher.\n\nThis letter is long, and I know you won’t want to read it. But you have to. You’re in danger.\n\nAfter May and I left home, I went to college, got a job as a counselor at an agency, and moved on. But not her. I loved her to death. I always will. But she wasn't cut out for it.\n\nShe made bad decisions, especially when it came to men. It wasn't her fault—we both know that Christopher, even if you choose to lie to yourself—but that didn’t make it any easier. Whenever things went wrong, and they always did, she would call me. And I would come running. No matter where I was, or what I was doing, I would go. Sometimes at great cost to both my emotional well-being and my professional life.\n\nI’m not telling you this because I want pity. I made those choices. And I’ve learned now that not everybody can be saved, no matter how much love you pour into them, how much pain you endure trying to separate them from twisted parts of themselves that they never asked for—that they never deserved.\n\nI’m telling you this so that you understand what came next.\n\nI had just started the morning shift when she called.\n\n‘Sammy,' she said immediately. 'I need help.’\n\nHer voice was timid. Unsure. Like she only half-meant what she was saying.\n\n‘What’s wrong?’\n\n‘Max isn't well.’\n\n‘What’s wrong? Does he need a doctor?’\n\n‘No, it’s not like that. He’s just acting weird. I thought maybe you could talk to him, you know, cos of what you do for your job.’\n\n‘I’m a grief counselor. If you’re worried about his mental health, you should encourage him to speak to someone who specializes in that. Maybe a psychologist.’\n\n‘He won’t. And I’m…’ she paused, then continued in a whisper, ‘I’m scared of what might happen.’\n\nMy chest tightened at the fear in her voice.\n\n‘Scared? What do you mean scared? Has he hit you?’\n\nI knew Max. He wasn’t a nice man—arrogant, slimy, a cheater. He’d tried to hit on me only a few months after he’d made things official with May. But I’d never got the vibe that he was violent. He seemed more like a gaslighter, an emotional manipulator.\n\nThe line was silent. I could only hear her breathing. ‘May?’\n\n‘Please come.’\n\nI wanted to argue; to tell her to leave. But we both know May would never do something like that on her own. That was too much like standing up for herself; not in her nature. Especially with men. I never blamed her for that. Abuse was all she knew. In her mind, that’s what men were, and that’s what women were expected to put up with. You and I both know where she got that from.\n\nI couldn’t have convinced her to leave. Not without real help. I could have phoned the police, but if I knew May—and I did—she would just cover for Max, regardless of what he was doing. More learned behavior.\n\n‘I’ll leave after my shift,’ I said.\n\n‘Thank you, Sammy. I love you.’\n\nShe ended the call.\n\nI almost died on that journey.\n\nI’d made the drive to May’s before, but never that sudden. Usually, I’d leave London early, trying to give myself plenty of daylight. There was none of that now. I drove at a crawl along a single-lane road in the pitch black, too afraid to go any faster in case I ran the car into a ditch. There was nothing for miles except sheep and cows, and I doubted either of those would know how to fix a car.\n\nI couldn’t stop thinking. Was I the reason May was always so helpless? I’d gone running to her repeatedly over the years. Every time something went wrong with another cruel bastard she’d invested in, I would stay with her, we would drink wine and talk and cry about the past, about that awful fucking house, and then I would leave. And she would be OK. For a short time.\n\nAnd then, inevitably, she would find another bastard. I wondered if my constant babying was preventing her from growing on her own.\n\nI was struggling to keep my eyes open when the radio cut out. One moment, some sweet, slow song was playing, then the next it was buried under a scream of static. That’s when the chanting began.\n\n*fa-liv-fa-liv-fa-liv*\n\nOnly a murmur at first, barely audible, but it got louder. It was a disturbing sound. Almost aggressive. I flicked my eyes briefly to the stereo to turn it off, and when I looked back to the road, there was a woman there.\n\nI slammed the brakes. The woman was hunched, pale, and very, very old. She held a large object that was dripping some thick black substance onto the road. The dark seemed to gather around her. I just stared for a while, anxiety twisting my guts into knots.\n\nThen, abruptly, she screamed, and the car actually shook with it. I instinctively reached for the gearstick, ready to reverse the whole way home.\n\nBut then something slammed into the window beside my head. I turned to look and she was there, impossibly blue eyes glaring at me through the glass. She lifted her arm and I screamed. A severed dog’s head hung from her fist, black and mangled and unnaturally big. I didn’t get a chance to see much else, because she quickly drew back her fist and then smacked the awful thing into the window again.\n\nThe radio came back to life, then: that same chanting from before. **Fah-liv fah-liv fah-liv**. The woman joined in too, but she roared it instead, punctuating each syllable by driving the head into the window.\n\nI hit the accelerator and the car lurched away, but somehow her body followed at the exact same speed. And still she slammed the head into the window; still she screamed those awful sounds at me. ***FAH-LIV FAH-LIV FAH-LIV FAH-LIV***. My heart beat so hard against my ribs that I thought it might break them.\n\nAnd then, as if suddenly bored with the whole thing, she was gone. I glanced into the driver’s mirror but there was no sign of her on the road. All that remained was the thick blood sliding down my right-hand window.\n\nIt’s funny how we rationalize clearly exceptional events. I think it is a defense mechanism used by the brain; a way to stave off the definite insanity that would come with accepting that there are things out there more powerful than us. That we aren’t the apex predator. Have you ever felt like that, Christopher?\n\nBy the time I reached May’s house, I was calm. I decided that the woman was nothing more than an escaped patient from a mental hospital. Never mind that she apparently teleported from the road to my window. Never mind that she managed to keep up with a rapidly accelerating car. I made up some bullshit explanation so I could file everything away in my mental ‘nope’ folder and move on with my life.\n\nIt worked for a short time.\n\nI stepped out of the car and hurried across the snow-covered lawn to May’s front door. I was still a little on edge, and even the trees of the north wood—my favorite part of the old farmhouse’s land—seemed to be creeping towards me in the dark. I rapped on the door. It swung open a few minutes later and light spilled out. May stood there. We grinned at each other and fell into a hug. All my anxiety melted away. My sister was a burden at times, yes, but she was my burden. And I loved her more than anything.\n\n‘It’s so good to see you,’ I said.\n\n‘Get in here.’\n\nI took a step forward, then stopped. ‘Fuck, I left my phone in the car.’\n\nMay peered into the dark behind me, and for just the briefest of moments, some indefinable look came over her face. Then she looked back at me and waved a hand. ‘Just leave it for now. You know we don’t have WiFi. And you’re definitely not getting phone service out here.’\n\n**\\*\\*\\***\n\n‘Where’s Max?’\n\nMay messed around with some blankets that had been draped over the couch. She hadn’t really looked at me since letting me in the house. ‘He’s out.’\n\n‘At this time? May, stop fucking around with the blankets. They’re fine.’\n\n‘Do you want some tea?’\n\nI groaned and stood directly in front of her. ‘You asked me to come here. Why are you acting weird? Stop dodging the question.’\n\nWe didn’t usually bicker. I was confused.\n\nShe put the blankets down and sighed. ‘Honestly, I don’t know where he is. He’s been disappearing in the middle of the night for weeks and doesn’t come back until early.’\n\nThe answer seemed obvious. ‘He’s having an affair.’\n\nShe glared at me. ‘No.’\n\nI was pissed off. I'd just driven for 10 hours and dealt with some deranged old bat with a thing for severed heads, all so I could come here and support May. Because she asked me to. Yet talking to her felt like a puzzle; like she didn’t want to tell me what was going on.\n\nBut that’s just what she’s like. Frantic one moment, evasive the next. And there's no point pressing her. She comes out of these things in her own time. \n\nDid you ever experience that part of her, Christopher? I think she developed it afterward, but I’m not sure. Maybe as a result of what happened.\n\n‘OK, sorry.’ I said. ‘Well if Max is out, and neither of us has to work tomorrow, why the fuck are you talking about tea? What wine you got?’\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nLater that night was when things began to escalate.\n\nMay relaxed a lot more once I stopped questioning her about Max, and we both chatted as normal and worked our way through a couple bottles of Merlot.\n\nAfter a while, I got up to go to the bathroom. May took the opportunity to refill our glasses and grab some snacks.\n\nI climbed the creaky stairs of the farmhouse, looking around, refamiliarising myself with the space. The nearest bathroom was on the first floor, at the end of a narrow hallway. Looking around, it was obvious how hard May tried to make the old place welcoming. The carpet was soft, the wallpaper bright, and each of the small table lamps dotted around the place glowed warmly. Pretty photographs lined the walls: picturesque Scottish villages and dramatic Highland landscapes. Even some of May's own paintings were up. I smiled at that. She never thought they were good enough, but they were. Maybe she was gaining some confidence.\n\nBut despite all her efforts, I still didn't like being upstairs alone. The passages all seemed a little too long; a little too narrow. And the light never reached the corners, where the shadows collected and congealed like muck. Away at the end of the hall, a huge window sat behind a set of curtains, which were not fully closed. The inky night leaked through.\n\nI wasn't far from the bathroom when I noticed May’s studio door was open. I had never been in before. She always kept it tightly closed. I think she was afraid of us judging her work the same way she judged herself.\n\nI peered inside. There was a painting on an easel in the center of the room.\n\nIt was a large canvas, too big for the stand, and like nothing I had seen May create before. She usually did still life; flowers and fruit and stuff like that, but this was something entirely different. And disturbing.\n\nThe painting was of a forest: tall, gaunt trees surrounding a black loch. A hunched figure stood by the edge, gray stringy hair pouring over its face. Three dogs lay slumped in a bloody mess at its feet. They were headless.\n\nI couldn’t take my eyes off the image. It had an aura to it, an essence, that felt almost magnetic. I know how this sounds, but at that moment it was like I was seeing the past and the future at the same time. I wasn’t in the farmhouse any longer. I was there, by the loch, with the freezing air and the stink of the dogs and that woman calling me.\n\nUntil a hand clamped down on my shoulder and I screamed.\n\nI turned to see May glaring at me. She slammed the studio door shut.\n\n‘It was open.’ I said.\n\n‘No, it wasn't. I always shut it. Always.’\n\n‘Yes, it was. Why would I lie about that? What is that painting anyway?’\n\n‘None of your business.’\n\n‘It’s grote-’\n\n‘I don’t want to talk about it. Just go back downstairs.’\n\nI took a step back, all interest in wine and conversation gone. ‘I actually think I’m going to go to bed.’\n\n‘Ok,’ she said, her face unchanged. ‘If that’s what you want.’\n\nI walked away from her, glancing back occasionally. She kept her eyes on me the whole time.\n\nWhen I turned down the hallway leading to my bedroom, I stopped. It was only after I was out of sight that I heard the sound of her footsteps receding.\n\nI didn’t know what to make of her reaction. I convinced myself she was upset about whatever was going on with Max and when I finally found out, it would all make sense. But that picture… I hated it. And it was the kind of thing May would hate too. I knew that. So why paint it?\n\nAnd no, the similarities between the painting and my experience with the old woman on the road didn’t escape me. There was clearly something more going on. But at that point, I was still living in the 'real' world. My brain wasn’t yet prepared or willing to explore what that connection meant.\n\nBut soon, I wouldn’t have a choice.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThere was something in my bedroom.\n\nI had just woken up. My eyes were heavy and itchy. I sat up in bed and gathered the covers around me to block out the cold. The temperature had plummeted since earlier in the evening. That wasn't strange on its own, but something felt off.\n\nThe old woman's face flashed in the inky blackness of the room and I sunk deeper into the pillows, the quilt pulled up to my eyes. I knew it was only a trick played by my sleep-deprived brain, but it’s hard to be rational when you’re alone in the dark.\n\nThen I heard somebody breathing.\n\n‘Who's there?’ I asked. My heart was pounding.\n\nNo reply. I slid the quilt down a little, half wanting to run from the room; half clinging to the childhood notion that hiding beneath the covers would protect me.\n\nBut protect me from what?\n\nAn old woman with manic eyes. A black dog, headless and bloody.\n\nBut that had been nothing more than an old lady off her meds. And besides, she was miles away. She couldn't have made it to May's house on her own.\n\nAnother breath. Then a scraping sound.\n\nI sprang up and my feet hit the floor. In my mind, I saw horrifying visions of wrinkled arms slithering from beneath the bedframe and wrapping around my ankles. I remember noticing the room door was open, just before scrambling through it. I never leave the door open at night.\n\nI escaped into the black hallway. The breathing and scraping sounds followed me, louder, right at my ear. I screamed and scrambled dangerously down the stairs, refusing to look back.\n\nWhen I reached the bottom I spun towards the front door and stopped dead. Something stood in front of me. Some gaunt silhouette, black against the living room light.\n\n‘Sammy?’ It said. ‘What’s going on?’\n\nA table lamp flicked on, and my sister’s face illuminated. I stared at her.\n\n‘Fuck, May, you scared the actual shit out of me.’\n\n‘I scared the shit out of you? You were running screaming through my house at 3 in the morning!’\n\nI laughed. Then she laughed, too. All my tension melted away. I thought I was just on edge from the whirlwind events of the past 24 hours and imagining things. It happened to everyone.\n\n‘Why are you still up?’ I said.\n\n‘I was just waiting for Max to come home.’\n\n‘At this time? Where is he?’\n\nShe gave me a funny look. ‘Right behind you.’\n\nAnd then I heard it again. That breathing.\n\nWhat stood behind me was not Max. At least, not as I knew him. I wasn't even sure it was human anymore. It was the most disgusting thing I had ever seen.\n\nIt brought its hand to its sickly green, pockmarked face and scratched at it slowly, bits of skin flying off everywhere. *Scrapescrapescrape*. Then it grinned at me. ‘Hi, Sammy,’ it said. ‘So nice of you to come all this way.’\n\nEven now, I see it clearly. That creature. I had never seen a sickness twist somebody the way Max had been twisted. I almost left right then, in the middle of the night.\n\nBut a part of me pitied him. He was an awful lowlife, an adulterer, but I honestly believe there is nobody on this earth who could see what I saw and not feel at least some sympathy.\n\nAnd now that I could see him, I wasn’t afraid. I was sure he had been in my bedroom and had followed me downstairs, but it was impossible to take him seriously as a threat anymore. He was hunched, weak, and pathetic. It looked like a strong wind could knock him over.\n\nAt least, that’s what I told myself. But looking back now I know it was all lies. I just couldn’t leave May, which meant I needed to justify staying somehow.\n\nSo I went back to bed, barred the door with a chair under the handle, and told myself I’d convince her to leave in the morning.\n\nIt was the biggest mistake of my life.",

        "text": "I'm a veterinarian and in my last visit I found a terrible letter in my last visit to a very way farm. The letter goes as follows:\n\nI live in a far a way farm in a country side away from any form of interaction or civilization.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is important because what I saw could not be a person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the middle of the night after a long day of working I was just trying to relaxing read a good old book. Then it started.The animals were acting different. It started with the horses. They were neighing in a weird way. I would have checked it, but as soon as it started it stoped.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next few days weren't different from the usual, until, maybe a week after the horses, the cows started to moo. But just like the horses it was different. I got out to check it, but as the last time it ended before I could check.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next few days passed normally, I still felt uneasy so I passed the nights sleeping in the couch next to the door. I was about to give up when it happened again. This time it wasn't just the horses and cows. It was the entire fucking farm! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got up to a run to see that the pigs and the sheep, even my loyal dog was barking weird. But this time was different. It was more as a scream than a call or anything. I tried to call them with ration, a special call, touch, everything I could think of I tried. Then all of a sudden they all stopped and fall to the ground, like they were worshipping someone, or something. They might have been done that the other two time and I just couldn't notice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first time I was annoyed by it, the second I was worry, but this time... I was trembling to my knees. I wasn't easily scared or afraid. But those sounds weren't normal. The first thing I did in in the morning was to call a veterinarian. But I wasn't taking any chances. I call all veterinarians I could afford. If my life stock is dead I can't make money. As I said before I live very far way so it would take them a day or two so every thing I could do as wait and hope this happens again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo my surprise, I was hopping this was just some in a lifetime thing, they were weirder. The pigs and sheep were running in circles and in the walls. The horses were jumping around and hitting each other. The cows were laying and rolling around. And my dog, who is usually very energetic were stand still like a statue. I was starting to think it was dead but somehow still up in all four, because of all the craziness that have been happening. If it wasn't for the dog's faint and weak gasps for air I would have digged a grave for the dog.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't know what to do. I was just... Out of my mind. When I was about to cry and run to the city to get something. They all made a sound like to call me, now I know why, and when I got there to check they were acting completely normal.  I should have suspect it, but a felling told me it was ok to get back. So I just went back like nothing happened. And in fact nothing extraordinary happened, until the night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow they were quite, except for the dog. The dog called me, we have a special sound we do to each other when we need. I got there to check it and in the corner of my eye, in the horazion I saw a human figure. And then I tried to get closer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI thought it was one of the veterinarians. And the closer I get the further it seems to be. I should stopped there, but something in me told me it was someone who needed help. I normally don't help other people. Hell! Why do you think I set up a farm so far away. But ignore the feeling made me sick and getting near the figure was satisfying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been walking for some time when I notice an old and rotting trough, the ones we put salt on to the life stock eat. It was there that hit me how much I have been walking, that trough is in the border of the farm, that's why it was rotting it is so far way it's not used anymore. That moment I tried to fled. I actually tried, but at that moment I saw it figure. He was like a young boy in a red coat and a short jeans. I was intrigued and continue to follow him in the middle of a dense forest. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI follow him for what it felt to be six hours, but I don't know if I can trust this because the stars and the moon were still out. And it wasn't like he was moving fast, he actually wasn't moving at all the distance just seems to stay the same. After a lot more time walking I began to see that there were less distance and I could finally picture his face. For my surprise his face was normal. At this point if his face was of my dog I would be less surprised. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut his face was normal and for some reason his face was scarier than it should be. Up close inspection he wasn't a kid he was more of an adult but in a small size. Then the kid just talked. His voice was monotone and calm yet distant, disturbing and creepy. He didn't say much, but it was enough to get to my bones, literally. He just said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I have played with you enough. Go home...\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe kid then just disappear like foam in the beach. I would try to find him, but that felling of sickness come back when I think of it. With fear I simply try to get back home and in just about ten minutes walking in the forest I got to what was supposed to be my farm. But it was different.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe placement of the corral, the main house and the dog's house were it was supposed to be, but they also we're distorted. It was like half of the main house were being built yesterday and the other half was abandoned for centuries. The corral were made of the animals I had, just then I realized it I was without any animals. The dog's house was like it was paint in the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore I could feel grief I felt a chill to my bones... literally. I realized I could feel my meat and my bones rubbing against it other, it felt great at first. But just soon after it start to feel the rubbing getting worse and worse. I'm writing this if the few strength I have left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know my time is coming, so now all can hope is that the veterinarians, or who the fuck comes first, to see what happened to my farm and take this as a warning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDON'T TALK WITH THIS KID!\n\nThe rest of the letter was just scribbles in gibberish.\n\nThis was expected as the corpse it was near had pitch black eyeballs and it's skin was all over the floor, his members were also twisted and broken. And I know the letter is true because I saw the rotting living corral and that made me sick to my stomach.\n\nAs I could do nothing more I decided to ignore it, ride back home and pass all that of as a weird dream. Wich let me to post this.\n\nI also have a dog and yesterday it was barking in a weird way to something. And when I tried to look at it, all I saw was... A kid... In a red coat... And short jeans. I don't know if the farmer's story is true, but I hope it is otherwise I don't think I have much time.",

        "text": "So me and my mate decided to go to this creepy forest everyday, nothing really happened at first when we explored it. Then we went a few weeks after, and we we're just chilling at a spot, Then I look to see if someone was behind us, and there was someone dress in fully black clothing. We got trapped, we went around to see if we can see where they were, and they were hiding in a bush very close to us. So we went into the back end of the forest and had to come back out cause it was a dead end. Then we sprinted out throught the back so he didn't see us or catch us. I slipped but got up quickly and we leged it. We then later found out he had a knife.\n\nThen this happend next time we went there, as we are about to leave, we hear a JACK IN THE BOX. We were like WTF, and we run out of there.\n\nAfter we run out of the forest, we were like,\n\n\"HOW is that possible? No one is down there with us.\"\n\nWe went in for a second time and we heard it closer to the entrence. Then we went in for a thrid time and didn't hear it at all. Then we left for that entire day and just went to town to chill. Then we came back a week after and nothing was there excpet when we go closer to the place we normaly hang out at, a branch just flew past. Yet again no one was there.\n\nSometimes we also hear trains (There use to be an old rail station there). This forest is just very weired and creepy as heck. I don't recommend going to creepy forests alone. This one is a highly dangerous one to go alone, I found out that someone got killed in this forest. \n\nWe have recorded some footage in that forest and it's on my YouTube channel called \"GamingSquiddy\" Video title is \"You won't believe what we saw... (Haunted Forest)\". Have a watch to see what I mean. Sadly we didn't catch those 2 things on camera because we weren't thinking of recording that day.\n\nThen after all that happened, we decided to go there over night, there was 3 of us, we had flashlights and everything to help us in case of emergency. We thought we would die cause we saw someone with a flashlight coming close to us, so we decided to do morse code with our flashlight (Luckily one of my mates knows how to do that). Then we walked closer to that person, turns out it was just a person with a dog walker and we scared them off.\n\nThen since that day we have been there a few more times and nothing else has happened. We will be recording a part 2 of the forest were we stay overnight and see what happens, but for that I decided to do it when I get 500 subscribers.",

        "text": " \n\nIt was a dark and moonless night when the sounds first reached my ears. I was sitting in my armchair, lost in thought, when the air was shattered by a piercing, unearthly scream. I leapt to my feet, my heart pounding in my chest, and listened as the scream faded into a mournful wail.\n\nI knew immediately what I had to do. I grabbed my coat and made my way to the cemetery, where my precious daughter, Lily, lay buried. As I approached her grave, I saw that the earth was shaking and the air was filled with a palpable sense of terror.\n\nI fell to my knees and called out to my daughter, begging her to stop the relentless screaming. But the screams only grew louder, more intense, and I felt as though I was being consumed by madness. I spent night after night in the cemetery, trying to comfort my daughter's tormented spirit, but nothing I did seemed to help.\n\nDesperate for answers, I sought the counsel of a wise old woman who lived on the outskirts of town. She was known for her knowledge of the paranormal and her ability to commune with the dead. I told her of my daughter's screams, and she listened with a grave expression on her face.\n\n\"Your daughter's soul is trapped in a state of eternal terror,\" she said. \"She is caught between this world and the next, unable to find peace.\"\n\nThe wise woman gave me a series of rituals to perform, and I did as she instructed. I lit candles, recited incantations, and made offerings to the spirits of the dead. But the screams only grew more frantic, more desperate. And I felt as though I was slowly losing my mind.\n\nI turned to the local priest for help, but he was skeptical of my claims. He told me that I was simply suffering from grief and that my mind was playing tricks on me. But I knew what I had heard, and I refused to be dismissed.\n\nOne night, as I knelt by Lily's grave, I heard a voice whisper, \"Save me.\" It was the voice of my daughter, and I felt a sudden surge of hope. I searched the cemetery, tearing up the earth and disturbing the graves in my desperation to find her. And finally, I stumbled upon a hidden chamber beneath the ground.\n\nIn the chamber, I saw Lily, her soul trapped in a cage of darkness and fear. She was screaming and wailing, her voice echoing through the void. I reached out to her, but the cage was bound by ancient magic, and I could not free her. I searched for the key, but it was nowhere to be found.\n\nAnd so, I sit here, beside my daughter's grave, listening to her screams and trying to find a way to ease her suffering. I have written this account in the hope that someone, somewhere, may have the knowledge to help me. For I am a desperate father, torn between this world and the next, searching for a way to save my child's soul from its eternal terror.",

However, the area around me looked entirely different. My blood no longer covered the floor, which now appeared to be made of a dark polished wood. There was now a large woven rug beneath me, providing some cushion. To my left was a small coffee table, which looked to be hand crafted and also polished. To my right was a raised hearth of nested fitted stones. They blended out into what was now a wall maybe of a combination of wood and stone. It had no windows. Within the hearth a decent fire flickered. It was considerably small for the room provided to it. High on the wall above the fireplace was a large portrait. A painting I hadn’t seen in a long time. Sunni and I were sitting together in a large armchair, while our siblings and parents stood around and behind us.\n\nIn front of me I could see a large oaken door, it was ornate and had gold detailing. I propped myself up carefully and made my way to my feet. I was still in my gown which remained stained crimson. I checked where I had been injured and sighed as each one was fully healed over. I began looking more around at my new surroundings. Directly opposite the oak door on the far wall were some double doors, both of which had windows on them. I made my way to look out to maybe get some semblance of where I was. In the corner by the doors was an old grand piano, I had to walk around it partially to get to the doors.  \n\n\n“This is a little too far out.” I commented to myself as I placed a hand on the key cover. Much to my surprise it then moved on its own to be pushed completely into the corner, leaving the walkway clear. I stared at it for a good few minutes before continuing to make my way to the doors.\n\nOutside the windows I could see a short porch with a swing and a cover. It seemed to wrap around towards the right and I couldn’t see where it ended. Beyond the porch I could see the endless white void. So I was exactly where I had passed out. This house had just crafted itself within the void. I turned back to the fireplace and where I had been on the floor was now filled with a few pieces of leather furniture. A couch, two chairs, and a loveseat. Opposite the fireplace was a tall staircase, above it a small balcony with two doors on it. The stairs came straight down for several steps before rotating to the right, where it met the floor. Examining them further, they also appeared hand crafted and polished, like the coffee table. There were distinct carve marks on each step and large posts which seemed to each be entire tree trunks marked each point in the turn. It had a rail all the way up which was carefully detailed. \n\nThe walkway at the base of the stairs went further away from the living room with one branch off. The break off walkway went behind and under the staircase. It seemed to wrap back to the living room. There were more stairs immediately beneath the ones leading to the indoor balcony, leading down into the floor, curving in the same direction so I couldn’t see what all was down there. I went back to the main path.\n\nJust a bit further there was a small nook out to the right. There was a large table with each seat already set. Once more the table and the chairs each appeared hand made. And further along was a really large kitchen which contained just about everything. I remember staring at it for several minutes just taking all of it in. Eventually I broke myself away to go see what was up the stairs. Once I was on the balcony I turned to look back over the whole of the living area. I was now at the same height as the painting and when I looked at it, my eyes instinctually met my mother’s. I quickly looked away and made my way beyond the doors. \n\nOn the other side was a massive bedroom. In the center was a bed I could only call “huge”. It looked at the very least king sized but it was definitely bigger. The frame itself, like almost every other piece of furniture, was visually handmade, and there was a thick comforter draped all the way to the floor on either side. Star patterns sewn in against a deep purple.. To the left came a shock. Against the far left wall, in a corner, there was a large bathtub. It appeared to be built into the room as it had its own walls and steps leading up to the edge. I decided to ignore that for now. \n\nOver to the right was something I didn’t expect in the slightest. There was a large triangular window, following the roof line on one side. Outside the window I could see trees and sky. Like the window sat on a mountain cliff. Which of course didn’t make a lick of sense at first because the two doors downstairs just led out to the void of this pocket dimension. Putting too much thought into it made me dizzy so I made my way back to the center of the room. I sat on the end of the bed, still in that gown.  \n\n\n“I need new clothes,” I said aloud to myself, and to my surprise a door appeared near the bathtub. That was something I definitely had to work to get used to. I stood back up and walked to the new door. Beyond it was a considerably large walk in closet. Why every room ended up being so big I do not know, at the time they were quite overwhelming but I’ve adjusted since then.\n\nI picked out some jeans, a button down, and sweater to wear, along with a pair of tennis shoes. I chose not to question how they all fit so well. I looked into the mirror on one of the walls to make sure it looked okay. I believe that was the first time I ever picked out my own clothing, and I was quite proud of it. I was curious how it would look if I tied my hair back. It had become about medium length. However as I held back a small pony tail with my hand all the scars on my forehead became fully visible. I let the hair fall back to cover it.\n\nI made my way back downstairs and over to one of the only two places I hadn’t yet checked. The ornate door in the living room. I had no interest in going down to the basement yet. I pushed down the knob and pulled it open. Outside that door was dense forest. I stepped out and looked back. The door was against an outstandingly massive tree. Redwood. I couldn’t see anything behind the tree to indicate a house of any sort. And the door was seemingly swinging into the trunk itself. With the limited knowledge that I had at that point it didn’t make a lick of sense to me, so I just went back inside and sat on the couch facing the fire which still burned in the hearth.\n\nI sat there for hours, I think, I can’t be certain. I had put myself into something called “soul space”. Which is essentially just my species’ way of disassociating. We withdraw ourselves from our bodies into this room within our minds. When we do this our eyes seem to “catch fire” and visually look like small suns. Which, given my species’ origin, makes sense, I suppose. It’s sort of a physical space we can exist within. Twins share a soul space from birth. So, I now try to avoid it if possible, but occasionally I check, just to make sure she’s not there. The silence is absolutely maddening. I sat in soul space on that couch for a long time.\n\nOnce I came out of it, I had decided that I would go to bed then, and when I woke up I would go to find Atticus and Virginia. I wanted to see them again, and let them know I was okay. I went back up the stairs and climbed into bed. The comforter was heavy and the mattress soft. I fell asleep the moment my head hit the pillow and It was the first actually good sleep I had gotten in years. \n\nWhen I woke up it looked like mid afternoon according to the window, however I can never be sure exactly where it’s showing unless it’s a widely recognizable location. I was still wearing the clothing I had put on from the closet, aside from the tennis shoes which I slipped back on. Yawned and stretched to wake myself up before making my way back downstairs. I didn’t know where they were, but I knew I had to find the Millers. That was my first mission, and I was determined to complete it no matter the costs.\n\nI went into the kitchen. Breakfast would come first. I hadn’t eaten in well over a year at that point and I could use the energy boost. On the peninsula island was a bowl of fruit: apples, bananas, and oranges. I picked up an apple and carried it to the sink, washing it off before taking a bite. A red delicious. When I turned back to the peninsula there was something new that definitely wasn’t there just moments prior. It was a newspaper dated September 29th, 1938. The top fold front page story title read in bold: “*Horrible car accident kills 2*.” As I stared at it I noticed another of the pages seemed to be dog-eared. I finished the apple and tossed the core in a trashcan. It promptly vanished entirely. Lifting the newspaper I unfolded it and flipped to the marked page, brows furrowed. The top of that page read “Obituaries”. There were only two names on it.\n\n*Atticus Miller, 28, 1910-1938*\n\n*Virginia Miller, 25, 1913-1938*\n\nI was frozen. That couldn’t be right. They were always so careful, what happened? The front page story. Shakily I closed the newspaper to read it.\n\n*HORRIBLE CAR ACCIDENT KILLS 2**: On Monday, September 26, a Ford Coup careened off the side of Cadillac Summit Road and caught fire at the bottom of a small valley between the peaks, killing the two occupants later identified by their dental records as Atticus and Virginia Miller. It is unknown as to the cause of the crash, however speculation suggests car issues or drunkenness as the road was in good condition for driving.*\n\nI couldn’t read any further. The paper fell from my hands and I collapsed to my knees. That wasn’t an accident. They had been killed because of me. Their death was on my hands. It was my fault. I yelled out to nobody, overwhelmed with despair. They were all I could have had. And now I was left with nothing.\n\nThat was when an entirely new emotion washed over me, something I wasn’t used to for sure. Rage. They were all going to pay. Each and every single one of them. I stood from the floor, my face was neutral but anger coursed through me. That rage lasted for at most a minute before I came to my senses. I was still angry, that was certain, but that was overwhelmed by mostly sadness. The rage didn’t feel like me at all. I left the newspaper on the counter and went into the living room. \n\nOn the coffee table there were two things, another newspaper, and an open 1946 calendar which had two dates circled in red. The first date circled was November 3rd, and in the box was written “escape”. The next date was November 12th, which read “today”. Since I had initially woken up the day before I concluded that meant I was unconscious on the floor for 8 days.\n\nThe Newspaper, which was dated November 11th’s front page header read: “*Investigation Causes Saint Neumann’s Asylum Closure. Staff Arrested*.” I read on.\n\n*On Monday, November 4th, an investigation was sparked into the Saint Neumann’s Asylum after a manhunt raised suspicion. Many patients have seemingly vanished from the hospital’s grounds with little searching done in years past, but after one particular patient’s escape on Sunday evening, many staff rounded up local men to track down the patient. The hospital’s reasoning for such a search out of nowhere was that the escaped patient was incredibly dangerous to both himself and the public, though they wouldn’t release his name or where he could be. Police searched the nearby woods and-*\n\nI put the paper back down. I already knew what went on within those walls. A smile crossed my face as tears fell. At least I did one good thing.\n\nPart 5",

        "text": " As a student of Portuguese and Spanish, I often found myself searching for new materials to read and improve my language skills. That's how I stumbled upon the e-book \"O Legítimo Diário de May\" and thought it would be a harmless way to pass the time. Little did I know that it would be the biggest mistake of my life.\n\nIt was said that anyone who read it would be haunted by the book's main character, a vengeful spirit named Mau, but I never believed in curses, ghosts or supernatural entities.\n\nAs I started reading the book, I felt a presence behind me, watching my every move. I tried to ignore it, but the feeling only grew stronger as I read deeper into the pages. It was as if someone was breathing down my neck, waiting for me to make a mistake.\n\nI soon discovered that the book was realy cursed, and the presence I felt was the vengeful spirit of May, a young woman who had been wronged in life and was seeking revenge on those who had crossed her.\n\nMay's haunting presence was inescapable. I see her face everywhere i went, in reflections and shadows. She was always there, watching and waiting.She would appear in my dreams, whispering her twisted promises of vengeance. Her voice grew louder every night, and her grip on my mind grew stronger.\n\nI tried to get rid of the cursed book by giving it away, but nobody wanted it. It was as if they all knew the horrors that lay within its digital pages.\n\nOne night, I woke up to find May standing at the foot of my bed, her twisted smile sending chills down my spine. I tried to scream, but I was paralyzed with fear. I reached out to touch her, and she disappeared into thin air.\n\nBut the nightmare was far from over. May's presence became more pronounced, and I knew that I was running out of time. I had to find a way to break the curse before it consumed me entirely.\n\nI searched for answers, hoping to find a way to rid myself of the cursed book and May's haunting presence. That was when I heard the other stories - the ones about the man who disappeared without a trace, leaving only his computer and the cursed e-book behind.\n\nI realized then that I was next. May had claimed another victim, and I was next in line.\n\nIn a moment of desperation, I took ALL my e-reader, smartphone, computer, laptop and threw it into the river, hoping to be rid of it once and for all. But as I turned to leave, I saw May standing at the water's edge, her twisted smile now turned into a look of rage.\n\nI ran for my life, not looking back until I was safe at home. But even then, I knew that the curse of \"O Legítimo Diário de May\" was far from over. May's haunting presence would stay with me forever, a constant reminder of the horrors that lay within that cursed e-book.",
