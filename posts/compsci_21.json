What are some good projects related to it? \n\nOne option that I have is a sort of aggregate summarization: Given an article as input (e.g. a NYT article about the royal wedding), find articles in other publications about the same topic and create a summary that uses information from all of the articles that are returned by the search function. \n\nThis might be too hard, though; I think the biggest challenge would be avoiding redundant information when summarizing the group of documents. I'd need some form of novelty detection or something. I liked this neat-looking project on Towards Data Science where the CEO of Machine Box [managed to make a very strong classifier that detected fake news](https://towardsdatascience.com/i-trained-fake-news-detection-ai-with-95-accuracy-and-almost-went-crazy-d10589aa57c). Stuff like that would require a lot of pre-handling the data; for the fake-news project the guy manually marked every article as being fake or real.",

I've been considering *Modern Computer Algebra* by Joachim von zur Gathen which seems to be a comprehensive resource on the subject; I've also seen *Computer Algebra and Symbolic Computation: Elementary Algorithms* which seems far less comprehensive but more like an introductory text with fewer prerequisites (those prerequisites being multivariable calculus, linear algebra, applied ordinary differential equations, and discrete mathematics, all of which I've just finished up taking).  \n\nWhich would be a better introductory text between the two, or what other resources might be an even better starting point?",

How long does it take to get a basic enough understanding of it to use it for research in grad school?\n\nMy hope is to use the time I’m doing my master’s to figure out a research proposal and then figure out what languages researchers who I would be a good fit with are using in their research.  So I might have 1-2 years to learn a language or two that my top picks for Phd programs are using and I can tell them I know.  Maybe I can learn more?  I’m starting with Python now, and I think I’ll do C or C++ next.  I’m still about 3 years away from being in a masters, so I’m wondering with 3+ years of experience how quickly I could pick up a new language to get a basic enough competency in it for a research setting.

Is there some concession that allows NaN to be positive or negative?\n\nEdit: just wanna come out and say that since I’ve been looking into this question I’m blown away with the amount of deliberation and inquiry. It’s truly fascinating that such a simple question seems to have such a multifaceted answer.",
