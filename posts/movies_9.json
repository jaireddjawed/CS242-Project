        "text": " If there is one takeaway from this most recent Oscars, it's that many people are racist, and they don't even know it.\n\nI am so sick of seeing people talk about how Angela Bassett was \"pissed\" or \"angry\" or \"shady.\" I have watched this clip multiple times [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NDeOvfBuWA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NDeOvfBuWA) , and I fail to see this characteristics in Angela Bassett's reaction. Instead, I see a stoic woman processing the fact that she just lost an award that she has wanted to win her whole career. She is not making any ugly faces. She is not screaming. If I lost a major award like that too, it would be hard for me to get up and start dancing and clapping for the winner.\n\nI then started seeing people talk about her reaction to Holly Hunter winning the Best Actress Oscar the year she was nominated for What's Love Got To Do With It. People said she reacted the same way then. Watch this video and tell me if that is the case [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E2g0LBoPs0&amp;t=59s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E2g0LBoPs0&amp;t=59s). I see a fellow actor who is probably disappointed that she lost but is gracious in defeat and happy for the winner.\n\nThis whole thing really reminds me of the scary black woman stereotype and the unconscious biases that people have. People want black women to act a certain way and if they do not, then they are viewed negatively. It makes me so sad that is one of the main takeaways from the ceremony that even major news publications are choosing to talk about. Many people making this remark about Angela Bassett are probably unaware of the stereotype that they are endorsing. If a white nominee had a similar reaction, I don't think we'd be having this conversation. In fact, I would say Glenn Close had a similar reaction when she lost Best Actress to Olivia Colman, but I do not recall anyone calling her \"shady.\" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUytvAg\\_hE4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUytvAg_hE4)",

I couldn't believe it didn't win Best Picture (Birdman? Why?).\n\nIf you're an Ethan Hawke fan, IMO it's by far his best movie and unfortunately he ran into J.K.

Even more so than most Marvel movies.\n\nI'm seriously saddened that it didn't get the attention it deserves. I hope Warner Brothers and everyone involved in it get a chance to make more, instead of the low budget animations that they churn out every year. \n\nI totally ignored it because I thought \"pets\" and Superman? \"What?\". \n\n10/10. \n\nHighly recommended if you like Superman but want a different take on his story universe.",

However, to me, the thematic and narrative beats of EEAAO are very similar to this Rick and Morty episode. \n\n1. The seemingly 'loser' husband \n2. The wife who thinks she would be more successful without him \n3. The disapproving father of the wife\n4. Coming to the realisation that even in a universe where they didn't choose each other, they can still see that they are drawn to each other and think about each other \n5. Weird realities with hotdogs/corn people\n6. Weird realities where animals control humans ('raccacoonie' and 'hamster in butt world') \n7. A way to scan for genetically similar versions of yourself in parallel realities \n8. The repetition of the concept 'nothing matters' \n\nThere's also the undertones of struggling with a seemingly monotonous life and then both sets of characters come out with an appreciation for the monotony. The two pieces aren't identical, but I was surprised to find no one discussed the parallels between these two creative universes. What do you think?",

A man opens a door to find a woman inside naked, changing her clothes. The polite person says, \"excuse me, madam\", and swiftly shuts the door. The one who says \"excuse me, monsieur\" and shuts the door, now that's somebody who's quick.\" - from Francois Truffaut's Baisers volés (Stolen Kisses)  \n\n\nSaw this account of politeness and quickness from Murakami's novella, An Independent Organ. How I am thinking about this is that by saying monsieur instead of madam, the one who shuts the door excuses the potential embarrassment of the lady, and is a sign of quick-wittedness. But I am curious if there are other interpretations of this account. Thanks!",

        "text": "Obviously \"Everything Everywhere\" is getting all the awards attention (and I'm quite happy for it). The one question for me is Ke Huy Quan competing in Best *Supporting* Actor rather than Best Actor. The role is either the 2nd or 3rd most important in the film, and it's clearly the biggest male role. Am I right in thinking that in the role was genderswapped, a woman could compete in \"Best Actress\" even if she's only the 2nd or 3rd largest role in the film?  \n\n\nPut it this way. Jamie Lee Curtis won Supporting Actress, and it's pretty clearly a much smaller role than Quan has. A quirky side character who has some scene-stealing moments--that's exactly what I expect from the \"Supporting\" role. In that sense it feels a bit odd for Quan to be a \"supporting\" actor considering how significant he is within the film as a whole.  \n\n\nMy speculation (and I know these things don't have clear \"rules\" and I might be trying to find some formal logic where there isn't any) is that the \"Best Actor\" category requires specifically being the main character in the whole film. But a female role could be \"Best Actress\" even if that isn't the most important character in the film, so long as she's the most important woman. Do you think that asymmetry exists in how these categories are decided?",
