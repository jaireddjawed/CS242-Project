I love when the feeling of an ending linger inside of me for a while, it was tragic but satisfactory and I didn’t expect it, mostly because I was focused about understanding what really went down. \n\nI found the speaking in verse distracting and that is because I’m not well versed in theatre, the only text I know almost by heart is Romeo and Juliet.  \n\nAs for characters: all the characters I could understand except for James. His choice is confusing to me, and this makes him more real. We don’t always react rationally or in our best interest. \nEven if  he was good/naive he displayed moments where he had a slight mean streak (saying to Meredith &gt;! you are not worth it!&lt;, for instance.) making him multidimensional. \n\nFor sure &gt;!Philippa and James!&lt; were the villains and let Oliver go down for them. What sounds not believable is the resignation in Oliver’s character where he accepts his fate without anger or regret.\n\nI guess he considered himself expendable because he lacked self esteem and basic self preservation instinct and I found this aspect of the story a tad unbelievable. \n\n\nThoughts?",

        "text": "(I am limiting the scope to U.S. schools because of the explicit relationship between Jim Crow legislation and the country. My arguments are germane in the U.S. (especially given an ongoing power imbalance) in a way that doesn't necessarily apply elsewhere.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI read Isaac Saney's article (linked below) describing why we should reconsider its usage in schools. Here are the major points:\n\n1. The book does not elevate Black people to a (white) human standard and leaves the racio-genetic justification of subjugation unscathed. As demonstrated most egregiously in the title, Lee argues that we should assail Black degradation in the same way that we renounce dog fighting: that it offends the high moral standards toward which Western (read: white-led) culture strives, not that it necessarily concerns Black people. Killing a mockingbird may be a crime, but the question of a mockingbird's role in a society that condemns such killings goes unanswered.  \n2. Tom Robinson lacks agency. He is waiting for a white messiah, when in fact Black political organization was and is crucial to liberation. Lee rejects the theory that people free themselves and instead supposes that Black people existed \"in paralysis.\"\n3. To that end, Atticus Finch intervenes on behalf of Tom and prevents a possible lynching. Such a depiction is specious on multiple fronts. The Southern white bourgeois was just as condoning (if not totally sanctioning) the legitimacy of segregation. While vigilante \"justice\" in the form of lynching and other terrorist methods were certainly rampant and impactful, the *de jure* system of racistly prosecuting and incarcerating Black people (while allowing said terrorists to inculcate their preferred society through fear tactics) contributed heavily to an environment in which lynching was permissible. Lee's image of a lawyer who exists apart from and above the fray of racism is fanciful.\n4. The book includes obvious epithets. Saney finds this argument weak but doesn't necessarily discount it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think about his reasoning? At least in my classrooms, TKAM was touted as a seminal work that deserved universal approbation, so I was interested to read a more critical evaluation. It also bears mentioning that Saney suggests replacing TKAM with Ellison and Neale Hurston, among others, as a means of re-invigorating the conversation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0306396803045001005](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0306396803045001005)",

        "text": "I've been reading the Brothers Karamazov for the last few months and finally finished it Saturday night. Yesterday I was talking to someone about it and actually broke down and started crying, something I didn't expect. There's so much tackled within the book that people have already commented on masterfully, but my two cents...\n\nThere was quite a number of topics touched upon that I'd been wrestling with, like hopefulness and optimism in the face of the world's atrocities, differentiating between those who embody religious values vs. the superficial hypocrites, wrestling with one's own prior ugly behavior spurned on by pain and recognizing it in others, hurting those we love etc. The book addresses virtually all of these and many more beautifully. I remember going into the pandemic wondering if my own sense of optimism was a naive one spurned on by privilege that would eventually fade away when joining the job market. Again and again it seems like empathy and compassion truly aren't as simplistic and simple minded as I may had been fearing and the book reaffirmed this. Everyone and their aunty goes on about Ivan and the Grand Inquisitor (understandably so: it's brilliant), but the various rebuttals provided throughout the latter half of the book were what struck a chord with me, which I suppose just goes to show the subjective nature of these things. Everything from &gt;!Father Zosima's teachings and stories to Grushenka's onions and Mitya and the nuts...only to end with Alyosha's speech to the boys, it was all so beautifully done.!&lt;\n\nIt's funny that I finished this book two days before moving into my own apartment and starting a job, essentially finally becoming an \"adult\". It feels nice to walk into it with these notions re-affirmed by Dostoyevsky. It's like a talisman of sorts. He kind of reminds me of Schopenhauer in regards to people seeing him as this \"doom and gloom\" guy when in actuality, like in *Crime and Punishment,* there seems to have a lot of compassion.\n\nSince 2020, I'd been looking forward to this book, hearing stories about how it impacted people's lives and inspired many philosophers etc, but I truly didn't expect it to move me as much as it did. It's truly remarkable and I can't recommend it enough.",

I guess some genres of music or literature used to be popular but not anymore. Also, new media of existing types of art seems to have given new perspectives or values to them (like Instagram made people take a lot of photos, probably particular types of photos like selfie). I thought there should be lots of research or studies going on, and while browsing the Internet, I came across Susan Sontag, which I figured would be a good start of the journey. \n\nNow I have 3 books on my table: \n\n1. her biography: Sontag Her Life and Work by Benjamin Moser\n2. Against Interpretations and Other Essays\n3. On Photography\n\nReading her biography first would probably make the other books easier to read because I would have more understanding about the context (and also given my lack of background in these fields), but at the same time, I am also afraid I might get biased with the biography so that I would read her books only in a certain perspective. \n\nDo you think I should just read in any order without being worried about those things? Or do you have any particular order to suggest? Do you have any other books or writers for the general topic that I am interested in?\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!",

I did enjoy it, and I will come back, but it still felt a bit screenplay-ish for my tastes. This cleaner style of writing often makes me wonder why I'm reading instead of watching it on film. And I'm starting to think my philosophy on literature might be that the less that actually happens, the better - all the more time the writer will spend poring over it, delving deeper into it.\n\nAlready in the first 150 pages I'm falling in love with Middlemarch. The characterization is deep enough to make me feel like this is a real living world and not just actors taking on a role long enough to play a story out for me. The insightful observations into human behavior that were peppered throughout AK feel a lot more densely concentrated here to me, too. It's the kind of thing I would have appreciated less each year earlier in my life I came across it, probably, but for the moment it feels almost like I've found the Victorian *Gormenghast -* at least in the way it takes its time painting each brushstroke of its world.",

No, my dearest love,  I would not for the world.`  \n\n`ALONSO. If this prove  A vision of the island, one dear son  Shall I twice lose.`  \n\n`SEBASTIAN. A most high miracle!`  \n\n`FERDINAND. Though the seas threaten, they are merciful;  I have curs'd them without cause. [Kneels]`  \n\n`ALONSO. Now all the blessings  Of a glad father compass thee about!  Arise, and say how thou cam'st here.`  \n\n`MIRANDA. O, wonder!  How many goodly creatures are there here!  How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world  That has such people in't!`  \n\n`PROSPERO. 'Tis new to thee.`\n\nMiranda's reaction to other people in this context seems jejune, if not totally naïve, when read in light of her situational ignorance. The only two people she has ever met are her doting father and her husband-to-be, who falls in love with her almost immediately and asserts that he would endure incarceration on the island indefinitely if he could see her face just once a day. Such a warped, Pollyanna-esque view of humanity is especially ironic when we consider whom she beholds: usurpers and would-be king killers. She now proclaims that the same men who essentially sentenced her to die as an infant and suppressed information regarding Ferdinand's survival are goodly. Moreover, if we extend her analysis of these newcomers to Trinculo and Stephano, she is even less informed about their priorities. \n\nWith all of that said, though, I still interpret Huxley's choice not as cynical but as hopeful. Yes, not all that gleams is gold. Yes, certain aspects of his dystopian world are repressive and horrid and frankly dystopic. Nonetheless, to assume that social relations and power dynamics are interminably stable and that a brave new world is beyond repair loses sight of *The Tempest*'s conclusion. Prospero is rushing back into the universe that once deposed and rejected him, with justice performed and his titles restored. Perhaps more importantly, he has regained what was lost while retaining his ability to demonstrate empathy (in forgiving Antonio) and mortality (in ceasing his relationship with magic). Invincible, conniving Prospero is not sailing back to Milan but rather his clement, improved version.\n\nTo that end, even if what awaits seems intimidating or utterly depraved, the brave new world is not something to which Shakespeare simply resigns his characters. Instead, they take initiative and actively set out to improve it. Whether we like it or not, we are also disembarking into a world that undoubtedly holds an allure of improved technology and the perils that accompany it.
