        "title": "Nausea by Sartre is actually a really important type of book to be read by everyone, for a very peculiar reason",
        "author": "Byte_Eater_",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/11sbqrc/nausea_by_sartre_is_actually_a_really_important/",
        "text": "Before I talk about the reason, I'll note that it's not necessarily to read exactly Nausea, but any similar book would suffice. By similar, I mean any book or text that can force a committed reader to have a glimpse of the existential dread and state of mind that Roquentin (the protagonist of Nausea) experiences.\n\nAlso, it's a tough book to read (even though it's not very long). The protagonist is a lonely intellectual, the book is a stream of consciousness of his melancholic, sometimes monotonic thoughts about existence. So the reader must also be in a mood to question the nature of existence, like a hermit seceded from society.\n\nNow, in order to build my reason for the importance of the book, we must separate the readers in two groups, to define the most important dichotomy of existence and the two major worldviews:\n\nGroup A - the people who think that God/Gods do not exist. That there are no souls, no continuity of consciousness after death, that only the physical Universe exist, and everything is utterly meaningless (from human point of view). Evidently nothingness can't exist physically, so space, matter and the laws of nature inevitably exist. They eventually developed the human brain which realized all that and invoked the existential dread and suffering. Obviously in this group fall Sartre and Roquentin.\n\nGroup B - the opposite, the people who think that there is God, souls and eternal afterlife, which could eventually converge in a paradise-state, eternal thought and happiness rather than eternal non-existence of the mind. These people usually should not experience existential dread or Roquentin's nausea, because they believe that God governs and fulfills with meaning and purpose all things that exist.\n\nAnd now, we could argue that Group A's reason to read the book is because it has become a classic of the journey \"existential realization -&gt; shock, denial &amp; Nausea -&gt; depression -&gt; acceptance\", which is important journey for all people of that group. And that Group B has no reason to deal with this, because they have the opposite worldview.\n\nBut the important reason even for the people of Group 2 to read the book, is: since from their point of view they take for granted that there is God, eternal existence and meaning of life, when they attempt to enter Roquentin's mind and feel the existential Nausea, the would realize how horrible a godless existence and a universe would be. Only in this way they can really feel the difference (eternal existence vs eternal oblivion), and would experience the ultimate appreciation a god-enabled universe.\n\nIn the end, it's a way for the two Groups to temporarily switch their places and understand both views, so they can reach completeness.\n\n**TLDR: Attempting to experience the existential angst in Nausea will show you how hopelessly horrible a godless universe and existence is. Then, if you believe in God (or simply imagine that you do if you don't), you can feel a unique bliss of appreciation of how infinitely better is to have existence, meaning and eternity backed by God-like power, compared to the tragedy of a meaningless existence.**\n\nOf course, we can further argue if God himself experiences nausea, or that an eternal soul would eventually encounter next-level existential problems, but still it's a good foundation from which to work on.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that not the entire book is purely about existentialism, there are also other great passages within it. Like the one where Roquentin has an intellectual anti-bourgeois battle with the portraits of the town's elite in the museum, or the alienated conversation with his former girlfriend, or his observations and analysis of the people in the town.",

Like a lot in my situation I was told that I \"wasn't stupid enough to be dyslexic and should stop being lazy\". As you can imagen, this made me avoid reading. I went the way of TV, films and mostly video games. I never really built up my reading skill and always find something else I could be doing instead of reading. Now I'm approching the big 3-0 I would like to change that.\n\nI got myself a kindle paperwhite so I can change the font and size so I can read a bit easier. It helps but at the end of the day, my reading skill is not very good and I find it hard to focus. I don't want to start reading childrens books but I know I need to read something maybe a bit simpler than what non-dyslexic adults read. When it comes to video games and films I enjoy all types of fantasy and horror (lovecraftian being one of my favourite types of horror. Listed to all of his stuff on audiobook). I don't mind sci-fi or cyberpunk settings either. Always love a good mystery. I don't mind romance as a side part of a story, but I'm not one to sit and watch a romance focused film.\n\nI'm pretty open to trying anything. I just want ot try and build a good hobby in reading instead of sititng ehre wishing I had as a child. I appreciate any help with this.",

        "text": "Having read The Master and Margarita and being absolutely fascinated by it, I decided to buy it again and reread it since my first copy has been lost. I picked up another translation this time for the sake of reading the story from a slightly different angle prose-wise.\n\nOut of curiosity I opened up the excerpts of both translations (that is, in Romanian), put them side by side and started comparing them, when I stumbled upon an interesting detail: [the newly bought translation](https://i.imgur.com/27LsVXI.png) omits, in the initial description of the character, the age of Berlioz, who, according to [the previous translation](https://i.imgur.com/siChKl9.png), is \"about 40 years old\". I found this quite curious and so I looked up Pevear and Volokhonsky's translation of the novel into English, only to find out that [it also includes](https://i.imgur.com/GLkR73o.png) this detail regarding Berlioz's age, of course to my disappointment at having bought a \"worse\" translation. \n\nThis wasn't enough for me so I dug a little further and looked for PDFs of the original text in Russian. I managed to find one, copied said paragraph from the PDF and pasted it into deepl in order to get an approximate translation. Surpisingly enough, [this version](http://www.bulgakov.ru/pdf/Master-i-Margarita.pdf) ALSO omits to provide Berlioz's age. I was completely bewildered.\n\nOnce again this wasn't enough so I opened up another Russian PDF. Upon translating it, it became clear to me that I wasn't going to be able to solve this mystery on my own because [this other version](https://imwerden.de/pdf/bulgakov_master_i_margarita_moskva_1966_11__ocr.pdf) in Russian actually mentions Berlioz's age as well.\n\nI have indeed done my research and found out that the novel, slightly unfinished by the author himself, has undergone several corrections, additions, censorship and so on during the course of its publishing, and so my question is: which version is closer to reality? Do we even know such thing? Am I going crazy?",

It tells me how long the chapters are, where to find them, and what to expect from the book. I personally love how writers like Jules Verne or Victor Hugo wrote spoiler-free chapters, not just names, but descriptions.\n\nThis is not just a trend in fiction but also happens in non-fiction books as well. Today I started reading a non-fiction book called \"The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry\", and I don't even know how many chapters the book has.\n\nWhy are publishers not including lists of chapters anymore? Are they trying to save pennies or assuming that readers are not interested in them anymore?",

        "text": "      I’ve always liked the *idea* of reading, and when I was around 20, I decided to try reading a bunch of classic/influential works but didn’t do a very good job.  Looking back, I treated the endeavor as a list of boxes to be ticked and didn’t fully understand or appreciate what I was reading.  This is what I mean by being a “bad” reader.  I don’t have any trouble reading the actual words and my vocabulary is pretty good, but “bad” in the sense of reading between the lines, understanding the author’s “message” or the overall “meaning” of a book. \n      For example, I remember reading Lolita and just taking everything at face value. I never questioned HH as a narrator, and finished it thinking Lolita was a mostly willing participant.  I realize now how badly I missed the point of the book. \n    I also had a lot of trouble reading older works, like Dickens, because the language was just so old fashioned, I’d read a whole paragraph and not understand what it meant.  This made reading anything “classic” a such a chore and I didn’t absorb anything. \n        I’m now in my late 30s, and although I’ve continued to read throughout my adult life, it’s all been mostly easy to read thrillers that don’t require much critical thinking.  I’ve decided to go back to my goal of reading the most influential books of all time, but knowing my weakness, I’d love to get some advice on being a better reader! I’d also love to get some recommendations on how to decide on which books to read/where to start.  Thanks so much!",

This will run for one month and then we intend to read the play 'Medea' by Euripides and 'The Library of Greek Mytholody' by Apollodorus in May/June.\n\n**About the books:**\n\n**The Argonautica** is an ancient retelling of the Jason and the Golden Fleece myth. It's very much an adventure story, so if you like your classics with a bit of action in them, this one is for you. The Argonautica is set in the generation before the events of the Trojan War and follows Jason, a fallen prince, as he goes on a quest to steal the golden fleece and claim his throne.\n\n**Medea** is a play and was written a bit later than most of the other books on our reading list. It follows the witch, Medea, after the events of Jason and the Golden Fleece. Without giving away spoilers I will say that this is a classic Greek tragedy and is a dark, emotional read.\n\n**The Library of Greek Mythology** is a short book that gives a run down of the main Greek mythos - so if you'd like to learn the general shape of the myths fairly quickly or want to brush up your knowledge, this is a good place to look.",

I loved the books too, but I can't say the process of \"reading\" them was as enjoyable as I'd like.  I think I just wanted to read it to get the full story and say I did it.  When I was 14/15 I think I read and reread the Fellowship of the Ring 3-4 times just because I would always get burnt out towards the end and have to start over.  It felt like a challenge but one that I wanted to finish.\n\nFlash forward to now.  I'm 30 years old, and I never thought it was possible to enjoy reading 25 pages about Hobbit relationships in the Shire as much as I do now.  \n\n\nI'm picking up so much humor and sarcasm that went over my head when I was a kid.  Instead of being bored to tears reading the description of every little grassy knoll, I'm now enjoying every word and fully being able to put myself in Middle Earth.\n\nMy girlfriend laughs at me because every night she finds me under the covers, listening to the movie soundtracks, and reading LOTR, for hours.\n\nWhile I knew just how incredible the books were, they're immensely more enjoyable as an adult.",

        "text": "Hey so this might come from an odd place but.\n\nPersonally, I find the lore and the universe of Hobbit / LOTR a bit dull. I haven't read the books, I've watched the movies as a young teen, but the universe just didn't interest me that much. I appreciate it for being the precursor to most modern fantasy, but I feel other fantasy worlds are just much more interesting to me. \n\n\\- Warhammer fantasy with it's \"grimdark\" and flavour to each faction that makes them interesting (Humans have gunpowder, Dwarfs hold grudges, man-sized evil rat civilisation, etc.)\n\n\\- The Witcher has it's more slavic/pagan style and while not being low-fantasy per-se, it always focuses more on the common people's struggles and realistic politicking, giving it it's grounded feel.\n\n\\- Song of Ice and Fire immerses you with its dirty politics and family drama, but then also every now and then flips everything on its head using its mysterious seemingly low fantasy world. \n\n\\- And there's certainly more really cool fantasy settings that I'm forgetting, but anyway my question is this.\n\nDoes the world feel unique and interesting despite being \"the OG\" ? Because on a first glance it just looks like it would feel very generic fantasy (Not of it's own fault, simply because it's the predecessor to most newer fantasy &amp; fantasy tropes.) Because from what I remember from the movies, everything felt like it has a different fantasy world counterpart that does the same idea far more interesting.",

I just find it odd that most of the people there are recommending romance or smut (which is fine).  But neither of which are apparently done well or eith any tact.  I just feel that there is too little content of people recommending contemporary or classic lit to a generally speaking young audience who may soon not have a chance to read them at school.   Things like How to Kill a Mackingbird, Beloved, Crime and Punishment. The things they carried.  As well as works from authors who are known for one or two works but have a backlog of other masterpieces and short stories.  \n\nI know this comes off as dickish.  But I'm not saying that you cannot read books to enjoy you have to read as a.mental exercise.  But I'd also plan to recommend fiction, manga, nonfiction, etc.  \n\nAs a note I would sensationalize what I post.  I won't post a video of myself crying or reading the last 20 pages.  Just the cover and a few themes on the video then a short plot synopsis on the caption. \n\nJust as a survey would anyone of you watch a booktok video about someone recommending books that are not in the normal sphere?.",

        "text": "Hello! Like many of you, I frequently find myself working on a few books at a time, mostly physical books. However, my wife is pretty sensitive to light at night, so for bedtime reading, I've been checking out e-books from the library to read a bit on my phone before dozing off. \n\n\nI first read \"The Metamorphosis\" by Kafka followed by \"The Stranger\" by Camus. They were pretty perfect for what I'm looking for in a bedtime read. Not too complicated, easy to leave off after a few pages and pick up again the next night. \n\n\nI then tried \"Heart of Darkness\" by Conrad - not such a good choice for the situation. Ended up reading the last half during non-bedtime hours because I felt like I wasn't staying with the story, so to speak. Then I got about 70 pages into \"I, Claudius\" by Robert Graves before realizing this may not be the best choice either. It seems good enough as a story, but a bit too layered for me to really appreciate in a half-asleep state. \n\n\nI'm currently working on \"The Sleeper and the Spindle\" by Neil Gaiman, and I like it, but I think this one will only take me another night or two. \n\n\nDoes anybody have recommendations for other bedtime reads similar to \"The Metamorphosis\" or \"The Stranger\" (fairly short, not incredibly complicated, but good quality writing)? I lean towards classics but I'm up for contemporary literature as well.",
