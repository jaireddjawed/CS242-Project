Everything he did was building towards something.  He was a real powerplayer who would come up with big plans and execute on them well.  He never seemed to do anything that wasn't part of some plan with a payoff.\n\nHowever, something that confused me was that he was always looking to do favors for people.  If he heard someone needed something, he'd be the guy to get it for them.  If you needed help with something, he'd really work to help you.  He seemed to do this all the time and it seemed to conflict with how he went about his life, which was everything was part of a plan.\n\nThen I realized why he did it.  He did favors to build up a network of people who liked him and would be inclined to help him.  His approach of executing big plans frequently required small favors from others and they were happy to do it because he helped them in the past.\n\nIt wasn't all quid pro quo.  He wanted to have good connections with everyone around him because that facilitated what he wanted to do and could get him inside knowledge too.  He was a good guy, not some fullt cold calculating person, he just really wanted to be doing big important things well and acted very much in a way to make it happen.",

Very few employers care about your GPA (or your magna cum laude) or club participation (or greek life).  Aside from making decent grades to stay in college and get a first interview (some companies require a 2.5, 2.75, or 3.0 GPA to interview on campus), everyone else looks at your experiences.  What work study projects did you do?  What volunteer work did you do?  What special research projects?  What internships?  As an employer, I am far more interested in candidates showing me that they have applied their knowledge and skills somewhere, anywhere.  I like well rounded candidates that have done something interesting.",

Have you ever wondered if the way you throw that block of cheese into the fridge, wrapped in the same piece of plastic wrap that was vacuum formed around it while being processed to be sold, was the best way to keep it fresh?\n\nI for some reason did. \n\nAnyway, here's what people who take cheese pretty seriously have to say about it.\n\n**Do NOT store your cheese in the plastic packaging it comes in.** Remove that nonsense when you get home from the grocery store. Plastic traps moisture and effects the flavor. Wrap it up in some wax paper, making sure to do it neatly so that the wax paper is touching all parts of the cheese. Cheese thrives when it can access the air and the wax paper allows that happen, while simultaneously wicking away moisture. Add a second barrier to protect the wax-wrapped cheese from absorbing any other odors in the fridge by putting it in a loosely closed bag.\n\nUse a new piece of wax paper when you use the cheese.\n\nDisclaimer - Apparently there is something called cheese paper, but it sure is difficult to see what the difference is between that and wax paper. For the sake of more information, you may want to look into cheese paper?\n\n**Do store it in the vegetable drawer, or if you have one, cheese drawer.** Or if you're feeling particularly fancy, keep your cheeses in it's own designated sealable, vented glass container. You're trying to keep the environment as stable as possible.\n\nThis will help keep your semi hard and hard cheeses fresher and tastier for longer.",

        "text": "I can't tell you how many times they've come in handy. Once the wind sent something smashing through my front window in the middle of the night, a tarp came in handy until morning. Another time our cat had stomach issues and decided he'd rather poop on the couch, a tarp was handy until we got him to the vet. Another time it was a smashed car window. Another time it was summer and the a/c went out, it was cooler to stay outside, a tarp made good ground cover and an emergency tent. So many more uses and a good HEAVY DUTY tarp is less than ten bucks at the dollar store. Keep one or two at home and one in your car, they come folded up and they're about the size of a briefcase. You just never know when you'll need it but you'll be glad you had one when the time comes.",

Light levels don't bother me, but if the upstairs neighbour has his TV loud enough (as usual)  i can't sleep until they decide to turn it off. \n\nSo this problem is magnitudes higher when theres a loud concert outside. Since it's far away, high-pitched sounds get muffled and low-pitch sounds are constantly booming in my ears. The muffling stresses me out, and the booming is making me very nervous (sensitive ears, recently had a hole in my eardrum), and subsecuently making it impossible to sleep.\n\nOne solution is to let it slide and eventually fall asleep due to tiredness, but last time this didn't work and i have been awake until 6 am, when the concert stopped. Sure, tomorrow is Sunday and i'm free all day, but it really fucks my productivity, as right now i'm too tired to do anything, and in the morning i'll be too tired to do anything. \n\nPlease help, i'm desperate",

The cloth was picking up dirt from the first windows and my rag became virtually useless. \n\nShould I have a clean cloth per window? I also tried newspaper, but I think my free paper was low quality and left lint and debris everywhere\n\nThanks!",
