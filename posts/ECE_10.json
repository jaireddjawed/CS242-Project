The issue is that I have little to no interest in anything around electrical engineering and didn't realize this until I had already graduated and got a job as one.\n\nAdmittedly, it's hard to say that for sure since the owner of the company I work for refuses to allow his engineers to do anything he doesn't understand (which restricts us to 1980s analogue technology), but I really don't care about doing the myriad Arduino and automation projects the other engineers talk about doing in their spare time. \n\nJumping ship to another company is difficult since, if I'm being honest with myself, I'm a pretty awful engineer that no one wants. Whether it's because of the lack of interest or lack of ability I can't say for sure.\n\nBefore you ask, the only thing I really do feel passionate about is 3d modelling, which is something I started for fun between graduating and starting this job, but that's not a sustainable income unless you're amazing, which I am not. \n\nJust staying here isn't an option. This company is so awful that people don't believe my stories, so I'll spare you. The only upside is the comradery of complaining about how awful the place is with the other engineers.\n\nAnyone have any suggestions? My coworkers arent very helpful.",

Starting from step one, I did none of these things before.

I don't know whether it is good. Don't know how to use it either. As a prime member, I will got my order on 9/21/2018. So could I continue to do Virtual Girlfriend 102? I would find out on Friday and report back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore I got my order, I will research more about everything and learn what I can learn now. At least I just learned what is ARDUINO.",

        "text": "I recently graduated from Gulf Coast State College (Panama City, FL) with a Technology Management BAS degree. Not gonna lie, I'm not really satisfied with this degree, but after spending so much time in school, I'd really like to get started on a proper career and get my life in order before I think about going back to school (if I ever do).\n\nI'd like to get a job involving electronics or computer hardware, but electronics was only a portion of my degree (it's basically a hybrid of electronics and business management, but IMO not enough of either to be worth a lot). I've put out some applications and looked at others, and for the most part, no one seems to be willing to hire someone with no work experience or certifications.\n\nSo, I'm thinking I could look into some certifications as a sort of post-degree education: I can study and self-teach, take the exams and get some accredited certifications to go on my resume while also refreshing what I learned in school (and learning what I didn't). It's not quite the same as work experience, but it would at least show that I have specific knowledge and skills and might get me in the door more than just having this degree. One of the issues I have with myself right now is that I don't have a whole lot in the way of marketable skills, and this may be a way to alleviate that a bit.\n\nRight now I'm looking over the ETA-I website to see what certifications they offer. So far, I'm looking at:\n\n- Basic electronics: The SET is aimed at high school students, but I think taking that as a lead-in to the five EM certs would be helpful. I don't know what I don't know, so I'm thinking I should start at the bottom to see what I need to work on. Then if I do get all five EM certifications, I'll end up with a CETa cert which seems really useful.\n\n- IT certifications: The IT certs seem like things I could look into, specifically the computer service technician and network technician certs. That said, these are going to require the most self-teaching as I did not take any networking courses as part of my degree. Also, I'm a bit wary of going into IT as I attempted a computer science degree and wound up changing to my current degree because I couldn't get into programming. I know \"IT\" is a pretty broad career category and it doesn't necessarily mean getting a programmer job, but again, I don't know what I don't know.\n\n- Renewable energy: These interest me a lot, but they'd be more of a long-term thing (something I'd go for after I already have a job). I could definitely see myself having a career in solar energy, but I'd rather get the basics down first rather than shoot for something so specific right away.\n\n- I've also looked at the CompTIA certifications, notably the IT fundamentals exam. That seems like something similar to the SET for electronics, where I could go for this certification to see where I stand and what I need to learn, and from there I could go for the more advanced IT certs from ETI.\n\nBasically... I don't feel my degree was enough. Notable courses I took: AC/DC electronics; Digital electronics; Electronic devices and circuits; Programmable logic controllers; Microcontroller technology; Intro-level courses to a few programming languages (nothing really stuck). It sounds good at first, but for a lot of those courses I really didn't retain much (I had the same instructor for Digital, Devices, and Microcontrollers and I had a host of problems with him and his teaching style). So, since just going back to school isn't really an option right now, I want to patch up the holes and I'm thinking certifications may be the way to do that and I want to know where I should start and whether this is a good idea.",

        "text": "For a bit of context, I graduated a couple years ago from a strong ECE school with a focus in circuit design and signal processing, with a bit of microcontroller work in there. I loved my program and what I studied (circuit design and signal processing were really cool!) and it made me really excited to begin work in industry.\n\nHowever, my industry experience has been really disappointing and has given me second thoughts about everything. My final long term internship before graduation was exclusively hardware focus doing analog motor design, and I found that really unpleasant as it was very slow paced and most of it was just testing different components and collecting data. I decided that as cool as it was learning about it, circuit design would not be right for me as a career.\n\nAfter graduating, I took a job as an embedded software engineer, implementing image processing algorithms on FPGAs - which I though would be right up my alley. However, that too I found very boring: simulating and checking bit correctness day after day was making me go crazy. It was slow and very repetitive. As well, the bulk of signal processing work was done by people with PhDs, and I was just implementing what they came up with which was not very challenging or interesting.\n\nDisappointed with my experiences, I decided to give high-level software engineering a try. After a bit of self-studying I was able to get a great software engineering job in the Bay Area. Although this has been the best of my experiences, I still do not enjoy it. What makes it better is that I find it faster paced; I am working on something different every few days, and the testing and debugging process goes a lot quicker than in hardware and embedded work. However, I find software engineering also un-challenging: I find that coding does not require the same level of analytical skill that hardware design does or as much attention to detail as embedded software. I can put up with it for now, but it scares me to think that this is what I will be doing for the rest of my life.\n\nI am seeking advice on where to go next. I have tried all hardware, embedded, and software jobs and none have made me happy nor have given me any sense of fulfillment. Maybe I have been unlucky in my experiences and should give one of them another go, maybe I should quit engineering altogether, or maybe I should give academia a shot. I wanted to become an engineer because I love building things, and I really loved learning about everything in school. But since graduating, I have found myself depressed going into work everyday. It does not excite me, and not what I want to be doing for the rest of life.\n\nI also think it's worth noting that I am a very hard worker. I had a 4.0 GPA, and if I need to learn a bunch of material in order to switch industries and find the right job then I will put in every bit of effort I have to.\n\nAny advice is appreciated.",

I need to propose a research topic within the next several months, but I'm having a lot of trouble with that.\n\nBriefly, my history in ECE is mainly with UAV control systems.  I've written/fixed most of my school's flight controller now - device drivers, signal filters, PID controllers, navigation, motion control, collision avoidance, performance measurement and communications.  I also integrated necessary 3rd-party software: ChibiOS and a state estimator.  In my opinion, it flies roughly as well as an ArduPilot or PX4 system, which is a decent accomplishment.  You can probably gather that my practical skill set is mostly in micro-controller programming.\n\nI get the sense that this has all been done before - it's good experience, but nothing about that is cutting-edge, and I'm not sure what nearby topics would be worth researching.\n\nSo my current plan is to survey papers published at recent conferences related to UAVs to get a sense for what categories current research is falling into.\n\nWhich brings me to my questions:\n\n1) Is this a good plan?\n\n2) Are you aware of any areas of potential research related to aircraft control systems that might be close to the work I've done?\n\n3) Should I be worried about doing something based mostly on computer science (like image processing or path-finding), as opposite to something that utilizes the things that computer engineers specialize in?",

The experience left me with a hunger for more experience and knowledge in electrical engineering. Ever since that week I have been designing my own small flight computers for model rockets and been experimenting with analog synthesizers in my free time. My problem is, however, I don't know enough to apply it practically to a problem. I know that I'm aware of how electrical circuits work but I have no theory behind any of it. So I want to get a minor in electrical engineering. I think having a classroom setting with professors to bounce ideas off of would be very beneficial to me as I learn to be an engineer. A textbook understanding so to speak. So what are your thoughts? Any advice for a mechanical seeking a minor in electrical? My university also does concentrations in an electrical engineering minor ( RF, control theory, micro processors, computer engineering, etc) which would let me chose a route to focus on. Thanks!",

People who are unfamiliar with it would wonder what it is or if it as good as Electrical Engineering.\n\nCan EET majors realistically get jobs working on developing hardware, robotics, etc?  Primarily jobs in new, maturing fields that consistently provide new problems to solve, even if not in R&amp;D. \n\nWhen I say realistically I mean that it is fairly common, not some unusual case that is unrepresentative of the alumni of the program and the quality of the classes.  An example of an unusual case is when a University of Phoenix accounting major actually gets well-paying work as an accountant.  That is unusual for such a bad school and most find their degrees to be worthless. \n\nedit.  Purdue EET is a four year degree that covers all of the theory that EE covers. ",

        "text": "Hello everybody,\n\nI am currently working on a Solar powered project but I am having a hard time making it work:\n\nI have a PCB with an Arduino and a sensor, this circuit consumes 250mA for around 2 seconds every 10 minutes and the remaining time consumes less than 1 mA,\n\nI am using a simple BJT TIP31 switch to turn off the sensor and sleeping the arduino to achieve this.\n\nFor powering this circuit I am using a 6300mAh 4.2V Li-Ion Battery connected to a TP4056 breakout board set to 1000mA and to a [1W 6V Solar cell](https://www.ebay.com/p/6v-1w-Solar-Panel-Module-DIY-for-Light-Battery-Cell-Phone-Toys-Chargers/21002783933?iid=401429619699&amp;chn=ps&amp;_ul=MX&amp;dispctrl=1) for charging the battery.\n\nThe goal is to keep the battery going infinitely (or at least give it a good lifetime \\~a year maybe) by charging it with the Sun\n\nThe battery goes in parallel to a AMS1117 regulator and then to the arduino PCB.\n\nUsually the system works for a couple of days at most (never seen more than 5) and dies.\n\nI am sure I am missing something on this design. My bets are the solar cell is not enough at all but also there are whole circuits that run on a single\n\ncoin battery for a long time (years) and have a higher power consumption than this one. How can they achieve this?\n\nWhat are your opinions on this according to the description provided?\n\nAny pointer in the right direction would be extremely useful. (Papers, previous similar work, researches, maybe changing some components… you name it)\n\nOn the top of my head some suggestions I’ve been considering are:\n\nMore power in Solar cell (Not ideal because of the size)\n\nChanging the regulator\n\nMaybe changing the battery design to two cells in series to provide more power\n\nChanging to a “smart” charger. I’ve got [this](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12885) at hand but it says it is for LiPO so I am not sure if this will work with Li Ion\n\nThanks in advance.",

        "text": "So I had some question about the pros and cons of connecting the source and bulk terminals together for  input MOS diff pairs and the effect it has on swing. For NMOS input diff pairs, connecting the source and the body terminals together gets rid of the threshold voltage modulation because of body effect. Since Vt is now a smaller value than if body was connected to ground and source is connected to drain of the tail current source, this improves swing. The tradeoff here would be that an isolated Pwell (surrounded by deep nwell) for the NMOS would take up space.\n\n1. My first question is that does this hold true for input diff PMOS pair. In a PMOS the magnitude of Vt increases if Vbs increases (not Vsb). So does ICMR max improve for a PMOS diff pair  if the bulk and source are tied together and Vt is kept at a minimum (as opposed to bulk tied to VDD)? I guess I am confused because I am not sure if we take the magnitude of Vt for a PMOS when calculating swing or ICMR? PMOS transistors always trip me up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) In both cases it seems space would an issue. Even if all the PMOS devices could have separate n wells, this would eat up die area. So if the devices share the same nwell connected to VDD, you tolerate the body effect because of reduction in space. Am I right here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) Besides swing, are there any other advantages of tying bulk and source together and giving up area? Any inherent advantage in terms of needing smaller Vgs bias voltages ? Does it help offset, PSRR etc.?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

And certainly not the cheapest way either.\n\nBut it does give me the opportunity to learn in a formal class setting, with project work to learn the concepts.\n\nAnd it would give me an opportunity to form relationships with professors and researchers, which could potentially pay dividends down the line if I want to go into R&amp;D work or go for a PhD.\n\nIs this an option worth pursuing? What other pros and cons are there to consider? And if I decide to go for it, what preliminary prep work can I do to hit the ground running in class?",

How they seem to be doing is shift `0x93` by 8 so it becomes `0x9300 | 0x0032 = 0x9332`. In their case, `x` is an `int` so in my platform, it's 4 bytes so I am ignoring the rest of the bits since they're zero.\n\nI am not sure about their implementation or am I misunderstanding it",
