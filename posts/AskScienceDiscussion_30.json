Would things like smog become visible before those then?\n\nAlso, if smog or other visible air pollution is present while the station is still relatively-livable, how would it spread within the rotating cylindrical structure?

        "text": "Hello! I am a teacher in an urban public high school. Next school year, 100% of my biology &amp; chemistry students will be ELL (English Language Learners), meaning that they are recently arrivals to the USA. These students are unfortunately often overlooked in classrooms and ushered away from higher level STEM classes. I am aiming to change that.\n\nI would *love* for my students to have words of encouragement from STEM professionals in or from their countries of origin. If you would be willing to send me a letter/card/postcard in your native language encouraging my students to pursue STEM career, I would be eternally grateful. Or perhaps photos of you in your laboratory setting or even words of encouragement in English? Anything is welcome!\n\nIf you are interested, please let me know and I will PM you the address to my school. Thanks so much!",

Temperature and amount of gas must remain constant in a closed system  \n2.) Pressure and volume is indirectly proportional to each other\n\nKnowing that the human body maintains a constant temperature internally through homeostasis and technically has a constant amount of gas (because of the abundance in the environment) in the system, so it follows the first statement.",

        "text": "[Not sure if I should post this in AskScience or here, as my question might not really be open-ended, but this is a controversial topic with lots of opinions.]\n\nI've always been pro-vaccines and still am, so don't get me wrong. I've been reading into the arguments of anti-vaxx, as I was curious why they are against vaccines. I also don't want to be that person that assumes thiings without looking into it. Most arguments are not well-grounded, or at least that is my opinion. But the argument that herd immunity does not exist, as vaccines only work for several years (some up to 10 years). So most adults are not immune anymore (so also no herd immunity).\n\nI saw confirmed on the Dutch website of the vaccine organisation (RIVM) that vaccinations only work for several years. Some longer than others. How can herd immunity be a thing then? As far as I know, only children are vaccinated. Adults not, except when they are going on vacation or are a high risk group for the flu. \n\nI still think that vaccinating is a good solution, although it might not be perfect. Just wondering about the science behind this herd immunity argument used by both sides.",

The article mentions several benefits:\n\n- the crops reduce ocean acidification, sequester CO2, make the area around it better for fishing\n\n- new jobs, and economically feasible way to help the environment\n\n- small footprint (takes little area to farm)\n\n- low effort, since these things grow in the ocean anyways and don't need extra inputs\n\nThe idea seems to be in infancy and I can only find positive but uninformative opinions on it. Anyone have a more informed opinion or see any problems with it?\n\nHere are some of the specific questions I was thinking of:\n\n- Is the potential environmental impact (denitrification, sequestering more CO2) at all significant at the ocean scale? How many farms would be needed to start making a real difference? Could there be negative consequences?\n\n- Could this really be profitable? How far away is that; is it just a matter of scale, or would there need to also be much more demand and cost reduction before it is feasible (currently it seems to be supported by external funding to keep it going)?\n\n- How feasible is kelp as a real food source, either for humans or for animal farming?",
