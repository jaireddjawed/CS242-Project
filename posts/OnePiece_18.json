        "text": "I'm not going to drag this, but please read through. I don't know why I can't shake off the idea that the traitor is Capone. That was the name that popped right in my head as soon as I saw the gun. I know it sounds like such a stretch but man. The more I think about it, it doesn't seem that crazy:\n\n1. Capone might not be known for his strength but he is certainly known for his ability to come up with the most elaborate plans to take down a Yonko. I mean if we had to think of a non Vegapunk individual who would figure out how to disable the protection dome, and orchestrate the events in egghead, Capone would certainly come to mind. \n\n2. He carries a gun similar to the one we see on the panel after shooting Shaka. \n\n3. The whole idea of capturing CP9 agents and locking them down alongside Vegapunk scream mafia boss. To quote the wiki directly: \"Bege can be very cunning and pragmatic, not being above taking hostages, bluffing, or shooting people in the back in order to accomplish his goals\"\n\n4. He can summon multiple subordinates to fight on his behalf (or take down the cameras on egghead). His Devil fruit can also allow him to keep all CP9 agents hostage and hidden within his body which is why Vegapunk did not notice until now. \n\n5. He is saddistic, blood thirsty, and according to the wiki: \"He does not crave power himself, but rather aims to destabilize the factions in power and watch the resulting struggle for power for his own entertainment...His enjoyment of chaos does not exclude that which is caused by someone other than himself.\"\n\n6. Motive. There might be very high bounties on the heads of the CP9 agent placed by Cross Guild and Egghead was the perfect fly trap to catch them all (this would be such a Capone move). If I had to think of a worst generation member who would certainly go out after bounties on marines and truly enjoy the process, Capone takes the cake. \n\nBonus connection: Capone really does not like Jewlery Bonney. What are the chances that Oda would have these two meet again on the same arch that with some many Sabaody  parallels. \n\n\nMaybe I'm crazy, but this would be such an Oda move if true.",

Mihawk and Jimbei didn't have any fruits so it made sense why S-Hawk and S-Shark were given ones, and it makes sense why they got the ones they did (a cutting fruit for a swordsman and a swimming fruit for a fishman). \n\nBut assuming S-Crocodile can't have a logia type, and assuming we're sticking with the original warlord members, is there a paramecia type fruit that would suit him? Nothing is really coming to mind. I have a loose, pretty much just a joke idea that he could get a time based one like Foxy's Noro Noro, just because of the incredibly loose relation to the ticking sound from Peter Pan (which I'm guessing Crocodile was influenced by given the hook and the, well crocodile). But I don't actually believe that would be it.\n\n I'm really interested to read up on theories of what it could be, but I can't find any discussions on it.

Let's ignore the fact big mom fucked him had the kids and kicked him out essentially letting him know to be thankful she doesn't just kill him.\n\nNot only does it show Pound and Chiffon crossing paths several times but ultimately, he never gets to even tell her he's her dad and just straight up gets killed off screen. Even in his 2nd act of uncharacteristic bravery to save his daughter she see's him but she doesn't recognize him and no one attempts to inform her. He's then supposedly slaughtered offscreen.\n\nWho knows maybe he will come back later like a badass and finally talk to chiffon but currently this inmy opinion is even worse the whitebeards death in terms of good dad's get bad deals in shows.",

        "text": "The long-awaited **chapter 1077** of One Piece is finally **out**. Again we were not shown who the **mysterious traitor of this arc** actually is, but surely after this chapter and after **Shaka**'s assassination, we can certainly get an idea.\n\nBefore going on to explain who this character could be in my opinion, I would like to list who it definitely **CANNOT be**. To do this we need to establish what characteristics the culprit must possess.\n\n1) **The culprit must have been present on the island for several months**. As is revealed in **chapter 1076**, the disappearances of the various members of the **CP5, CP7, and CP8** sent to Egghead to check on Vegapunk’s work, date back at least **2 months ago** and was caused by the sea beast weapons (probably **controlled by someone able to do that**). \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aind145udtma1.png?width=392&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=802a9e127256e8608c76706d09ae793fca28589b\n\n2) **This character must have the ability to control the seraphim**. As we know the control of the seraphim takes place thanks to a precise hierarchy explained by **Stussy** in **chapter 1069**. At the top of the **hierarchy**, there are the 5 elders, followed by Vegapunk (Stella and satellites), Sentomaru, and finally by the owners of an authority chip. If you don’t own an authority chip or are one of the characters listed above, you cannot give an order to the seraphim.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uorlvq6rgtma1.png?width=281&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=59632698098775ea4cfc4c152341d955e668f604\n\n3) **The traitor must be someone who knows the lab very well.** In chapter 1071 we discover that someone has **deactivated the frontier dome**, the barrier that protects the laboratory. A character unaware of the **island's** various **mechanisms** could never perform such an action. This action doesn't even seem random since it happens just when **Luffy's group** returns to the **laboratory with Vegapunk** and **Lucci** prepares to **invade the building.**\n\nBased on these characteristics, which must all match the capabilities of the character in question, we can already eliminate a few names from the list:\n\n* **Caribou**. I honestly never understood the idea that many have he could be the culprit. First of all because in chapter 1065 when Zoro chases Caribou from the ship, he is scared by the fact that Egghead is a **government island**, consequently he cannot have the slightest idea of how the laboratory works and above all, he has no idea what even the frontier dome is. Moreover, on a narrative level, this choice would not make much sense.\n* **Saturn**. Many thought that the gorosei was responsible for the mess that is happening on the island but even here there are various reasons to think it is not him. The imminent **arrival of Saturn** is revealed only in **chapter 1073**, when the **frontier dome** has already been deactivated. Furthermore, it is explained to us that an order can only be given to seraphim **directly** and not through **Den Den Mushi**. To conclude, the traitor's silhouette that we see in chapter 1075 makes it clear that the traitor was already present on the island, an arrival of a gorosei and above all Kizaru would be easily picked up by the strongest Mugiwara (Luffy, Zoro, Sanji, Jinbe).\n* **S-Flamingo**. A character who has made a lot of talk about himself in recent weeks is **Doflamingo's seraphim**. I would exclude this option a priori as it is very unlikely that a seraphim is able to **give orders** to his fellow men and above all to have such intelligence as to act alone **without someone above him**. We have seen that all seraphim except S-Snake are not even able to speak, let alone even **sabotage the entire laboratory**.\n\nThis leads us to think that the traitor must be one of the punks. Let's see one by one which satellites are most likely to be part of the sabotage:\n\n1) **Shaka** was for a long time the main suspect for a large part of the readers but given the latest events in **1077**, I think that getting **shot** in the head and drawing blood from the skull is reason enough to exclude **punk 01** from this hunt for the traitor.\n\n2) **Lilith** and **York** could easily be ruled out as they were **petrified by S-Snake**.\n\n3) **Edison**, another prime suspect is seen in this chapter to have been **knocked out by S-Shark**.\n\nThe only two satellites on which we can still have doubts are two: **Pythagoras** and **Atlas**. However, the latter should in my opinion be excluded for obvious reasons: after being **knocked out by Lucci** in chapter **1068** she remained unconscious and **under repair** until chapter **1074**, the same chapter where we see **Pythagoras** was attacked by **someone in the shadows**. However, he is not to be excluded since in this last chapter after the petrification of Franky's group, he is not seen again. Did he head to the dungeons right after? Unlikely but not impossible. However, him being the traitor wouldn’t explain who the **person in the shadow was that attacked him**. \n\nMy guess is that the **traitor** is actually **one of the punks** but not one of the 6 that were presented to us, but **a seventh**. The latter could be presented as **Vegapunk 00**, a further expansion of the scientist who, however, the other punks don't know or don't know actually **came to life**. This seventh Vegapunk could have been created by the **artificial intelligence** itself, **Punk Records**. A mini clue that made me think about this was the words of Pythagoras when asked by Lilith who created that explosion earlier:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6jlkfyc6gtma1.png?width=137&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=29692bea711234687ce8c0ca4ab040cb7fb53262\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, here it is not clear whether **Pythagoras** was referring to the traitor or to **S-Snake** but what convinced me 100% that he wasn’t, is the **onomatopoeia of the footsteps** of this figure which is equally represented both when Pythagoras is about to be attacked and in this last chapter:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oz8lt5p1htma1.png?width=476&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=943ca5650f34eb34818dedfa55618fe9694ab623\n\nIt could also be that **Vegapunk himself** does not know the **existence of this satellite** and that it was created automatically by **Punk Records** itself. The presence of a seventh satellite would explain many things and above all it would make sense, being a character who **moves in the shadows** that none of the punks suspects is around the laboratory and who above all is able to do everything that only a punk could do: **deactivate the frontier dome, give a direct order to the seraphim, take Vegapunk to the dungeons** where perhaps he himself was created etc...\n\nAt this moment it is almost impossible for us to **identify** this character, but among all the hypotheses, the most plausible is, in my opinion, that this is a character that has not yet been seen since almost all the others have an **alibi** or have demonstrated by being petrified or attacked that they are not the traitor. Hopefully, 1078 will give us a clearer answer to this.",

        "text": "The long-awaited **chapter 1077** of One Piece is finally out. Again we were not shown who the mysterious **traitor** of this saga could be, but surely after this chapter and after **Shaka**'s assassination, we can certainly get an idea.\n\nBefore going on to explain who this character could be in my opinion, I would like to list who it definitely CANNOT be. To do this we need to establish what characteristics the culprit must possess.\n\n* **The culprit must have been present on the island for several months**. As is revealed in chapter 1076, the disappearances of the various members of the CP5, CP7, and CP8 sent to Egghead to check on Vegapunk’s work, date back at least 2 months ago and was caused by the sea beast weapons (probably controlled by someone able to do that).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2927d5146tma1.png?width=257&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=69805e97db8ca37118404a1dda97735d85fbd078\n\n* **This character must have the ability to control the seraphim**. As we know the control of the seraphim takes place thanks to a precise **hierarchy** explained by Stussy in chapter 1069. At the top of the hierarchy, there are the **5 elders**, followed by **Vegapunk (Stella and satellites)**, **Sentomaru**, and finally by the **owners of an authority chip**. If you don’t own an authority chip or are one of the characters listed above, you cannot give an order to the seraphim.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xewbza556tma1.png?width=257&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1d69e9c2973854be071fd15069a83205c78d1b69\n\n* **The traitor must be someone who knows the lab very well**. In chapter 1071 we discover that someone has deactivated the frontier dome, the barrier that protects the laboratory. A character unaware of the island's various mechanisms could never perform such an action. This action doesn't even seem random since it happens just when Luffy's group returns to the laboratory with Vegapunk and Lucci prepares to invade the building.\n\nBased on these characteristics, which must all match the capabilities of the character in question, we can already eliminate a few names from the list:\n\n* **Caribou**. I honestly never understood the idea that many have he could be the culprit. First of all because in chapter 1065 when Zoro chases Caribou from the ship, he is scared by the fact that Egghead is a government island, consequently he cannot have the slightest idea of how the laboratory works and above all he has no idea what even the frontier dome is. Moreover, on a narrative level, this choice would not make much sense.\n* **Saturn**. Many thought that the gorosei was responsible for the mess that is happening on the island but even here there are various reasons to think it is not him. The imminent arrival of Saturn is revealed only in chapter 1073, when the frontier dome has already been deactivated. Furthermore, it is explained to us that an order can only be given to seraphim directly and not through Den Den Mushi. To conclude, the traitor's silhouette that we see in chapter 1075 makes it clear that the traitor was already present on the island, an arrival of a gorosei and above all Kizaru would be easily picked up by the strongest Mugiwara (Luffy, Zoro, Sanji, Jinbe).\n* **S-Flamingo**. A character who has made a lot of talk about himself in recent weeks is Doflamingo's seraphim. I would exclude this option a priori as it is very unlikely that a seraphim is able to give orders to his fellow men and above all to have such intelligence as to act alone without someone above him. We have seen that all seraphim except S-Snake are not even able to speak, let alone even sabotage the entire laboratory.\n\nThis leads us to think that the traitor must be one of the punks. Let's see one by one which satellites are most likely to be part of the sabotage:\n\n* **Shaka** was for a long time the main suspect by a large part of the fanbase but given the latest events in 1077, I think that getting shot in the head and drawing blood from the skull is reason enough to exclude punk 01 from this hunt for the traitor.\n* **Lilith and York** could easily be ruled out as they were petrified by S-Snake.\n* **Edison**, another prime suspect is seen in this chapter to have been knocked out by S-Shark.\n\nThe only two satellites on which we can still have doubts are two: **Pythagoras and Atlas**. However, the latter should in my opinion be excluded for obvious reasons: after being knocked out by Lucci in chapter 1068 she remained unconscious and under repair until chapter 1074, the same chapter where we see **Pythagoras was attacked by someone in the shadows**. However, he is not to be excluded since in this last chapter after the petrification of Franky's group, he is not seen again. Did he head to the dungeons right after? Unlikely but not impossible. However, him being the traitor wouldn’t explain who the person in the shadow was that attacked him.\n\nMy guess is that the traitor is actually one of the punks but not one of the 6 that were presented to us, but a seventh. The latter could be presented as Vegapunk 00, a further expansion of the scientist who, however, the other punks do not know or do not know actually came to life. A mini clue that made me think about this were the words of Pythagoras when asked by Lilith who created that explosion earlier:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xqnx2pa66tma1.png?width=65&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f5f779adb0be709638858a4257723c5c7e2fa396\n\nHowever, here it is not clear whether Pythagoras was referring to the traitor or to S-Snake but what convinced me 100% that he wasn’t, is the onomatopoeia of the footsteps of this figure which is equally represented both when Pythagoras is about to be attacked and in this last chapter:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mcrv8bk76tma1.png?width=468&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=cd6ab69a54e0176cb7a78c5532f872b0fd280423\n\nIt could also be that Vegapunk himself does not know the existence of this satellite and that it was created automatically by Punk Records itself. The presence of a seventh satellite would explain many things and above all it would make sense, being a character who moves in the shadows that none of the punks suspects is around the laboratory and who above all is able to do everything that only a punk could do: deactivate the frontier dome, give a direct order to the seraphim, take Vegapunk to the dungeons where perhaps he himself was created etc...\n\nFor the moment it is almost impossible for us to identify this character, but among all the hypotheses, the most plausible is that this is a character that has not yet been seen since almost all the others have an alibi or have demonstrated by being petrified or attacked that they are not They. Hopefully, 1078 will give us a clearer answer to this.",

        "text": "... is the traitor. I hope this is okay to post as I'm not going to use any info from the current chapter. Also this might have been done before.\n\nIn Vegapunk's flashback we saw his interaction with dragon, in which he is called a government lapdog. This obviously refers to the fact that he is working for them and building them weapons like the pacifista. VP defends this stance by saying he wants to destroy them from within. But I think there is another reason, he does not like to admit: He is simply scared of the WG. He is a smart man, knows about their power and knows that the revolutionaries don't have the manpower to bring them down (and to be fair, they haven't).\n\nAnother character trait of his is shying away from open conflicts. This can be seen in his treatment of bonney. Instead of explaining the situation and facing the consequences he is running away from her.\n\nWhile the revolutionary sense might be stronger in the stellar VP, the same does not hold for his sattelites. When he split up his personality, one of them must have gotten the part that is afraid of facing the WG and prefers stability over justice. It is this part that is now sabotaging the escape, in order to be able to stay with the WG.\n\nThe remaining question is, who of the sattelites inherited that part? My claim on this is number 6, York. Her trait, 'desire', includes the simple desire to stay alive.\n\nShe is also the only one for whom it wouldnt be suspicious to not synchronize with the full brain, as noone expects her to make significant contributions. This explains why the others didn't catch on to her even though they share a brain.\n\nThats basically it, what do you think?\n\nTLDR: York is afraid of the WG and wants to stay alive, so she betrays the others.",

It would make me think it has to be someone with hard shoes and someone enough of a threat to make Vegapunk look that scared which to me would be Imu. \n\nI think if this theory comes to fruition then I believe this is the exact chapter where Imu and the five elders start to get physically involved(Saturn of course heading to egghead right now) and we start counting down the chapters to the obvious massive final battle between Luffy and his allies vs The WG and who they have. \n\nPossible Imu is capturing Vegapunk to force him to make more Seraphims, devil fruits etc for the world government to use for their army given the [“Control Levels”](https://imgur.com/a/M2yjcsP) puts them in direct control.",

We have no idea what happened with blueno since the CP9 independent report (besides a weird film red appearance lol), but its not a stretch of imagination that he's still working for the government. Remember when his fruit was introduced? Another arc plagued with deep mystery:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/39cvlnrd9sma1.png?width=1028&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6e8ff816730808d8a48a04257c77d36ecfd10cf3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p1zw3sge9sma1.png?width=988&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a15b36d16238e9d798cf200eee2d555a2c13df25\n\nHe's also using a gun here for those who want to claim he's got finger pistol. What a perfect fruit for stealth operations. I'm pretty sure he says that exact line somewhere else, but I didn't want to look forever. But Blueno has another way to use his power for stealth...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oqow9e2g9sma1.png?width=994&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=638324a5b46a9bbada72f026d3588b9a0ce8ea78\n\nWith 'Air Door,' allowing him to very easily move between the spaces of Vegapunk's lab undetected. Note the outline of the door appearing in the air here.\n\nWith all the deception we've seen from the government so far, do you really think it would be impossible for him to be given orders to kidnap other Cipher Pol agents to make it look like Vegapunk had done so?\n\nNow let's go to the lab:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7k398jwi9sma1.png?width=1338&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4092eb0e0132174bfe4168a12d5e8497f51613e3\n\nA character mysteriously appears with a gun and ASSASSINATES Shaka. How curious.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/809jx0hi9sma1.png?width=344&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=891adb5ec027d0ad406eb1c9d72a692603739816\n\nI can see a very slight outline of the 'Air Door' appearing behind Shaka.\n\nBlueno can bring people with him through his Air Door, so we don't need to limit ourselves to a single person who could be roaming around the lab. Now we just have to think of who it could be with him. it could easily be someone smart enough to know the lab and how to let down the dome barrier. He has also most definitely improved his ability over the last 2 years as well.\n\n\"KTOK\" is the stepping noise we heard from Im when they were first introduced. Why wouldn't the government use their best stealth operator to move around their highest authority figure?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow to revel in all the other people it couldn't be.\n\n* One of the Vegapunks. I would have believed it up until this chapter too. It could have been the case that one or two of them rebelled against punk, but for the most part the suspect ones have been ruled out (RIP Shaka, Lilith is busy in this chapter). Feel free to stake your claim.\n* S-Flamingo. There is no evidence at all that Vegapunk made this little guy. He absolutely could have, but with all the Seraphim we've seen so far, he has yet to be even mentioned.\n* Stussy. Pick a fucking side you sexy demon lady!\n* Caribou... come on.\n\nThere is no reason why it should be any character we have never met yet. The chapter title has a double meaning to Zoro's idiocy - that we already have the return of some Cipher Pol agents, why wouldn't we also see the return of Blueno?",

Not like he was much of relevance now, I just feel like since we met him, it'd be weird to kill him off panel. \nHe could show his death in a flashback ofc, but I just think that his death is staged, either by him or somebody else. \nOr pretty much everyone assumes he's dead, but he managed to somehow survive. \n\nAs well as Sabo. I don't like him, but I don't see him being introduced as a replacement Ace 3 arcs ago and now being killed. For me, there's no impact there. \n\n\"Oh no, my brother axe died. But Sabo lives?! But then Sabo dies...\"",
