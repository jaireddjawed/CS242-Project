I've heard from different professors about their sabbatical and it sounds like most use the time to work on other projects and also relax a little. I can imagine that the specifics vary by school/program. \n\nHere are some of the questions I have: how often can you go on sabbatical leave? how long is the leave (duration)? how long do you have to be a professor for to be able to take this leave - do you have to be tenured to be eligible for this? what do you do during that time? are you required to continue admin-like responsibilities in the university (like serving on committees or teaching) during that time? do you have to report to the university what you did during the leave? what happens if you are advising students when you go to sabbatical - do you continue to regularly meet with them/hold lab meetings/etc?  do you request this through the university and then they decide when and how long the leave will be? do you continue getting the same pay during that time? why is this a thing - it seems like an odd thing to me, so how did this start or why? \n\nAny other things you would like to share? \n\nI searched in this sub for a similar post but couldn't find any that went into the specifics. I am not interested in pursing an academic career, so I'm just curious about how this works. Sorry if it seems like a basic question but no one really has explained it to me and I think I heard about this for the first time while I was an undergraduate student.

I understand PhD programs in most European countries are very research focused and have less coursework than US programs typically do.\n\nI currently have a Masters in International Education from US university that likely has no name recognition in Europe. Furthermore, as this was a MA program, I did not do much actual research and only wrote one major paper in grad school. Thus, I am not sure if I would even be qualified to pursue a PhD right off the bat.\n\nMy question is - would it be easier to apply for another Masters program in the EU and then try to apply for a PhD from there (potentially in the same country/program)? I would rather not add to my student loans but I think it's likely I need that additional research experience and academic contacts. I would be looking into countries with low tuition as it seems most Masters programs are not funded for non-EU citizens in the Social sciences. \n\nAlso if anyone has any recommendations for masters/PhD programs for Sociology in Europe, please let me know!

However, since then, I have had the opportunity to work on research projects with my organization and found myself drawn to the work. That interest in research led me to apply to an R3 Ph.D. program at a medium-sized private non-profit midwestern university. The opportunity also exists for me to earn a second master's through this program. \n\n**Question:** \n\nWhile my MBA has benefited me professionally, and the work in the program led to me gaining new skills and competencies, I know that it is a liability in academia due to the stigma associated with such schools.

        "text": "In the US, your probationary period for tenure usually lasts 5 years (although it can stretch up to 7-8 years with extensions for facilities disruption, parental leave, for the past few years there have been COVID extensions and 6-8 years is not uncommon).  In my department at an R1 university for an experimental science, the expectation is pretty much as follows:\n\n1. Get a major grant--usually \\~$600K-$1 million+ USD for a period of 5 years.  It depends on field/institution, and the more experimentally heavy the more money is required.  Essentially, you are expected to have a self-sustaining amount of money and expected to get close to what the university granted in startup funding (typically $600K USD-%1 million for a mid to top tier R1 for wet lab STEM).  Collaborative grants are icing on the cake, but at least one of these grants you are expected to be the lead or solo PI to demonstrate \"independence.\"  Some universities care less about that latter point and more about the overall money and indirects to the university, but it's not uncommon to hear about \"independence.\"  In my department the big ones are NSF (especially NSF CAREER), RO1/R35 from NIH, and DOE Young Investigator.\n2. Have a major portfolio of peer reviewed research.  In my department, the magic number is 10 peer reviewed publications.  Some fields expect fewer, some more.  Some departments care more about journal quality, some just count.  In my department, review articles and book chapters are a plus, but they don't really count, although this varies by department/field.  I was also explicitly told that the majority of the articles must have me as the corresponding author and if there is a co-corresponding author for collaborative work, I must justify my contribution.  Any paper published from work from my PhD or postdoc does not count, even if it comes out while being a tenure track professor.  Any research that collaborates with my postdoc or PhD advisor doesn't count because it doesn't indicate scientific independence (I can collaborate with others, just not previous mentors).  Some departments are less hung up about the independence point (especially certain fields of biology), but it's not uncommon to hear this point.\n3. Have full professors in your field vouch for your body of work, and collect at least 10 letters from them that go into your tenure packet.  One way to build contacts to do this is to go on a tenure tour the year you go up for tenure where you visit at least 10-15 universities with the work you will be presenting when you go up for tenure (at my university, this is typically done during semesters when you are teaching, so it is a real juggle to get course coverage, although some universities provide a teaching release for this).  Again, this differs by field, but this is my field's norm.  This shows you are a \"somebody\" in your field.\n\nEverything else is considered, but less of a consideration.  Stuff that goes into your packet includes\n\n\\--Teaching, although in my experience, as long as you do a good enough job, no one really cares if you are an exceptional teacher.  Maybe getting an award for teaching excellence might be seen as a plus.  \n\\--Serving on departmental and university committees as well as service to the field (reviewing for grant panels, organizing symposia for professional meetings, peer review for journals).  You must do some university/departmental service, but going above and beyond is not really rewarded.  Service to the field shows you have more of a reputation within your field and matters more, but it's mostly a checkbox because papers, grants, and letters matter the most  \n\\--Getting invited to national and international conferences and getting invited to give talks to other research universities.  This is a plus, but where it really matters is if it helps your letters  \n\\--Awards (this is icing on the cake, but no one is denied tenure for not having awards)  \n\\--Mentorship (you need to have graduated at least one PhD student at my university.  Having good placement is a plus, but won't determine whether or not you get tenure)  \n\\--Scientific outreach (a plus, but not necessary)  \n\\--Contributions to DEI (no one cares about this if we are being honest, but you need to fill out the section to pay lip service)\n\nIt's considered important to push this decision until you and your department head are absolutely sure you will hit the bar in my department (even though you forgo a raise).  So again, you will see people go up at 7 years instead of 5 years frequently if they took parental leave or other extensions like for lab renovations.\n\nI've heard from friends in other systems that the expectations tend to be much more chill in other countries, albeit with much fewer resources in terms of financial support to get launched.  Specifically I've heard the expectations are as follows:  \n\n\n1. UK/Australia/NZ has a confirmation period for continuing track lecturers that is typically 3-4 years.  Mostly you are expected to teach, to publish, go to conferences and talks, apply for grants (and hopefully get one), and to contribute to service (such as peer review).  But my understanding is no one expects you to have this whole established program in that period, it's more of a check in to make sure you are doing your job to get confirmed/promoted to Sr. Lecturer.  The expectation of having all this internationally recognized program is more at the Assoc. Prof/Reader level.  There also seems to be less of an emphasis on independence where your papers where you are not last author (or you collaborate with your postdoc advisor) are not counted--mostly that you are contributing to peer reviewed research more generally. It seems fairly rare for someone to not be confirmed if they are basically doing their job.  You also don't get a massive startup and often start in shared lab space, however, so it's just all around a different setup.\n2. Canada has a tenure system that on its face seems similar, but also is just more chill.  You are hired for tenure and it is exceedingly uncommon for people to not get promoted to Associate Prof.  Basically, you need a grant (can be a small NSERC grant), a few papers (definitely not 10+!  I've heard as few as a couple might be OK, although more is better) that show you are actively publishing and 3-4 external letters along with meeting your typically teaching, service to university/department/discipline requirements.  No huge tenure tour or anything like that, but being asked to give talks is viewed favorably.  Startups are \\*much\\* lower than the US, however and more equipment is purchased through infrastructure grants.\n3. Some EU countries (like the Netherlands) have a probationary period of \\~1-1.5 years.  Not really sure what the bar is and I'm just all around less familiar with it.  My German friend said that it's similar to the US there, but others have told me differently.\n4. Japan has you working under full professors as an Assistant Professor and there is a pretty long route to independence compared to the US, but other than that I'm less familiar.\n\nAny thoughts to compare/contrast systems would be appreciated!",

        "text": "Hi, I am a senior in the second to last semester of my bachelor's degree in English Literature and History. I'm kind of freaking out right now because I have to present both of my projects next week and I have no idea how to really present either of these projects. I really just chose topics that were important to me but didn't realize I'd have to present them. \n\nHere is my project for history:\n\nMy thesis is a bit unclear but a classmate of mine didn't include hers in her presentation and it went really well. So, this is just what it's about. I am doing a historical look into the tradition of sexual exploitation of female ballet dancers at the Paris Opera Ballet between 1830 and 1900. A big part of my research has been looking into: 1). Why it happened 2). How it went on for so long 3). Who was most at risk and who was doing the exploiting? \n\nI'm not 100% sure what direction to go in for explaining why this should matter to others. I considered  talking about modern day examples of abuse in ballet, such as in the Vienna ballet school that was closed down a few years ago because of exploitation of their dancers and abuse, or the school in the UK or Ireland that had a similar long-standing tradition of this. But I don't know if I should say that the situation in Paris was a microcosm of the overall situation in the ballet world today, or what. \n\nI also considered going in the direction of how sensationalism is harmful to celebrities and to society as a whole. I say this because ballerinas during this time were viewed as celebrities in their own right as much as they were also lowkey viewed in some way as high-class courtesans. People bought the lightness of their dances and the glamourous lifestyle and sent their daughters to the school to try to become ballerinas, and many of them, if they made it far enough, would end up simply becoming victims of harassment and abuse, living in poverty, and exploited sometimes by their parents and by the ballet company and school. It reminds me a bit of Alyson Stoner's research on the Toddler-to-Trainwreck pipeline, and how this exploitation affects people who grew up in the limelight or on the stage. This wasn't actually a part of my original thesis but I'm unsure if it makes sense. I think maybe it connects to the modern era pretty well, but I'm just not 100% sure.\n\nThis is my project for English Lit:\n\nSo, without going into too much detail, my project in English lit is actually more historical in nature than anything. It's basically a literary and historical analysis of American Children's and YA WW2 novels presentation of Polish history, and how many authors essentially, in the name of creative liberty, participate in the act of revisionism of history in order to get their point across. While some creative liberty is to be expected in most historical novels, the books I'm looking at have glaring issues that are more harmful than they are helpful to the genre. So, like in the Devil's Arithmetic, Jane Yolen drops her 12 year old character into 1942 Poland through use of a time slip narrative. But in the book, she makes it so that the main character tries to warn everyone of the Nazi's plans and all the Jews are 1). passive 2). acting like she's crazy. But at this point in history, the Nazi's had occupied Poland for almost three years, and most Jews were already in ghettos or camps unless they were aryan enough looking to be shipped elsewhere (if they were children). The Warsaw Uprising alone tells us that Jewish victims of the holocaust fought back against the Nazis, as did the non-Jewish/Roma Poles. And this isn't the only issue that happens in that book, or in the other one. \n\nSo, the literary connection I make with this historical analysis is to the way gender plays a role in these novels. In both of the books I've read, the stories are highly gendered. Much of the focus of the stories is on girlhood: Hannah in The Devil's Arithmetic must learn why it is important to remember the Holocaust, therefore the entire book reads like the most gruesome punishment in the world for what can only be identified today as generational trauma. I believe the only reason why the book was written so factually incorrect was to push forward that narrative of if we just remember, it'll never happen again. But writing it this way is more harmful than it is helpful because it isn't just creative liberty. It's revising history. In actuality, the story could have easily told the truth and shown the strength and resilience of Polish Jews who didn't take the abuse lying down at all. Anna in the other book I read is only saved from the trauma of war after she is sexually abused while getting medication for a man that is never properly explained for his part in the war. You never know what side he's on, if he is on one, if he's a professor, a physicist, or a soldier, or why he doesn't leave Poland but choses to walk around it on foot from region to region and avoiding people. She rarely experiences any war related trauma, or even the physical affects of walking 24/7, eating mostly roots, nuts and berries, and sleeping outside in a Polish winter with only winter gear stolen off of dead bodies and an umbrella she has to share for shelter. Her story literally ends after she Becomes A Woman and is abused. Then, she is sent off on a boat toward an unnamed country.\n\nMy overall point is that it is inherently harmful to future generations to revise history in such a way that not only fits traditional gender roles, but also is either unrealistic or essentially lying. I'm unsure if I want to present this in the direction of talking about Poland's own revisionist efforts to remain a noble victim of WWII and how American authors revising history in their own stories to match their own opinions speaks a lot more about global revisionism trends than it does about teaching anyone about the Holocaust or WWII. \n\nI'm not 100% sure any of that makes sense but hopefully someone can help me.",

        "text": "About a month ago the dept head from the institution where I received my master's degree in a STEM field (I never finished a PhD) contacted me and encouraged me to apply for a position as a full time lecturer. I suspected I was their \"safety candidate\" because I'm not a terribly competitive candidate (M.S. is 7 years old, was out of the workforce for a while in the time since, and have no university level teaching experience aside from TAing of course, currently adjuncting at a community college).\n\nRegardless, I was initially going to run with it as far as I could, but somehow I ended up talking myself out of it.\n\nThe posting was going to close by this weekend. I've been sick for over a week so not at my best, plus I've been struggling with a miserable adjunct position and was feeling completely submerged with obligations. I had my doubts about the job (below) and yesterday I said to myself, \"You are not going to apply for this job, so just email the dept head and thank him for extending the opportunity and be done with it.\" I sent a very generic email not mentioning any specific reasons, and he wrote back that he regretted to hear I wouldn't be applying and would support me in future endeavors.\n\nToday I am filled with regret. For one thing, it pays a heck of a lot better than adjunct-ing, and I need the money, and it was the best opportunity I was going to get. No other university is going to hire me. If I want to get away from adjuncting, other than this job, my options are probably teaching high school science or math.\n\nMy reasons for deciding against applying:\n\n\\-- I think it would be very hard to go back to the institution where I got my M.S. because that was a very intense and turbulent time in my life; I studied very hard and wanted to progress to the PhD program but ended up not being PhD material (grades were okay, my research ability was deemed to be sub-par), and I felt like I would relive that entire time in my life with all its disappointments and regrets and wasn't convinced that would be a mentally healthy situation. I felt it I needed to move forwards, not backwards.\n\n\\-- I hated the geographic area the institution is located in, both in terms of climate (extremely hot, very limited outdoor recreation) and mentality (a lot of social problems and petty crime) and didn't really want to live there again, particularly since I now have a 4 year old daughter.\n\n\\-- I have been struggling with less than optimal feedback on my teaching skills while working as an adjunct with a much smaller class size. I felt like I was truly not lecturer material, especially teaching 12 credits per semester. I think my organization skills leave something to be desired, my knowledge of the subject is not what it should be, plus I know I am at best a dull lecturer. I really didn't think I was qualified, and I thought it was better that I use my judgement and withdraw rather than get offered the job, accept, move down there, and get fired. (I know someone's going to say \"Imposter Syndrome\"... maybe? I've lost all perspective.)\n\nDo these reasons make sense? Am I just second guessing a rational decision to not apply? If not, is it too late to change my mind?\n\nThis is a really embarrassing post to write and I appreciate any response.",

We had a meeting last week and my supervisor gave me a lot of concrete feedback on my statement, and I revised it accordingly. \nBecause some schools ask applicants to reach out to potential supervisors, I have been in contact with a professor in another university and sent her my statement as requested.

My confidence comes partly from my own ability as a future scholar, also partly from my faith in my thesis supervisor, as we have gone through the argument I make in my statement step by step. However, the potential supervisor replied to me, saying that the fundamental premise of the argument I make in my statement is flawed and that this flawed argument \"would not provide a sufficient foundation for doctoral studies.\" When I got the email I was dumbfounded by how quickly the potential supervisor shuts down even the possibility of the premise being open for debate. She simply says that \"it shouldn't be....\", whilst my thesis supervisor has published multiple papers in respectable journals exploring the possibility of the very premise.\nI've generally enjoyed my graduate studies and have had other tenured professors at my department saying to me \"you should do a PhD/you are perfectly capable of doing a PhD.\" However, this small incident was frustrating in this application process, to say the very least. I think I'm just going to forward the email I got from the potential supervisor to my thesis supervisor and ask for his take. \n\nAlright, rant over.

Some of it is unavoidable (grad student needs to purchase chemicals for their experiment and need me to click a button to approve) and some of it is my poor boundaries (working on a grant proposal on the plane back from a vacation).  But I've sort of found my groove with it.\n\nI'm moving to an Australian university next year, and this comes with four weeks of annual leave.  I have been told that there is team teaching so I will never be responsible for a whole semester of course prep like I am in the US which means I will be less tethered to the academic year for travel.  But I was curious how this all works.  Specifically:\n\n\\--When you travel for a conference or seminar, surely this does not count towards annual leave?  Would I just need to file a travel authorization in something like Concur or similar like I do in the US?\n\n\\--Can you work remotely without needing to file for annual leave?  For example, to work on writing papers or grants from home?  What about if you are working remotely but visiting family abroad?\n\n\\--The university I am at closes campus down completely for \\~2 weeks around Christmas/New Years.  Does this count towards annual leave?\n\nFor part of my postdoc, since I worked for an institution that was unionized, I had to fill out a time card with annual leave.  I worked a ton of weekends/holidays/overtime that never got credited, because there was no mechanism to pay us beyond 40 hours a week, but that was my choice.  Then later on I got on a fellowship and didn't need to fill our the time card.  So basically, only \\~2 years of my whole academic life have I needed to file for leave.  I know this is a totally normal thing for employment, but I have been in the ivory tower too long, haha.",

The only piece that focuses on the same historical organization that my article focuses on is a poorly sources old thesis. Now, in the introduction of my article I point out that this thesis is poorly sources and imprecise/superficial. But is this sufficient or do I have to point out specific mistakes/unwarranted claims the thesis makes in the paper later on in my footnotes as well? \n\nI would think that my discussion in my intro would be enough warning to future readers to read/use this thesis with caution and I would feel petty pointing out every single minor mistake/problematic claim. Apart from being petty, this would also add quite a bit to my footnotes. So am I correct that after flagging it in my intro, I do not have to point out all those little problematic claims or mistakes in the thesis?",

        "text": "Hey everyone,This question deals with multiple issues but since I’d mainly like advice from Academics I hope it’s okay to post here.\n\nI’m from the Netherlands. I’ve done my bachelor in HR and immediately after got accepted into a traineeship at the regional government. I worked this job for 4 years, it payed relatively well but I absolutely hated it. I moved out, had little friends, was extremely lonely, dreaded going to work and was diagnosed with depression.\n\nAbout a year ago I finally took the step to pursue a degree in something I loved; Middle Eastern Studies (an interdisciplinary study in which my focus lies mainly on modern Islamic ideology and Muslims in contemporary societies), which would take 2 years. Since I had to work both the job that I hated part time for financial reasons and had to study full time it took a lot of effort. Yet to my surprise I was extremely good at studying. I also made quite a lot of friends, got into a relationship the year before I started and things were seemingly going well. \n\nSadly my relationship with my ex ended at the beginning of this year and the combination of the large workload plus the heartbreak became a bit too much so I decided to quit my job and apply for student loans for my 2nd year of study. I still absolutely love what I’m doing. My grades are consistently high and my professors never fail to tell me that I’m basically cut out for this.\n\nMy dream is to work in academia. I know I need to pursue a PhD for that. At the same time, I’ve always wanted to settle down and have a family, it’s been a big dream of mine ever since I was a teen (I’m 28 atm). I’ve met someone new and we’ve been getting along very well but I know that if I want to pursue a PhD in this field there’s a large chance of having to move out of the country, because funded PhD positions in my field are scarce. I also know that even if I do manage to land a fully funded position, it would be barely enough to get by and I won’t be able to pay off the debt I’ve amassed this year till after the PhD.\n\nThe girl I’m seeing will still be in uni for 2 more years and so wouldn’t be able to move with me, which we’ve discussed. After the PhD I probably will have to do a Post-Doc in yet another country so finding a partner to settle down with will probably be hard for the next 4+ years. I will also be far away from the friends I’ve made and I’m quite scared of being thrown back in the lonely position I was in before.\n\nI’ve been reading how hard it is to find a position in the Humanities and I’ve started to realize that even if I finish a PhD I’m not guaranteed to actually find work within academia. I’m also not the biggest networker, which seems to be really important. At the same time I’ve never felt this passionate about something before.I’m quite lost about what to do. Should I give up on my dream of working in Academia, so I can settle, keep in contact with the friends I made and all those things that have given me an increase in happiness as of late, knowing that it means giving up on doing what I love and working a job that I probably won’t be passionate about? Or should I pursue my passion knowing there is a risk that after 4+ years I might still not find a position in academia and will end up feeling like I’ve wasted another 4 years of my life, falling behind my peers (which I already feel like I kinda am). Or is there a way in which I can make both work? Is it true that it’s near impossible to find a position as a professor in my field?\n\nI know in the end this is my decision, but I would love to get some advice from anyone who has been in a similar situation or who works in  Islamic/Middle-Eastern studies etc.",

        "text": "I have this paper for which I designed the study, collected the data and wrote the actual paper all by myself, with little outside help. I'm a last year PhD student, so that has been tough from time to times, and of course with hindsight, there is a lot to improve next time. The paper accrued 2 rejects after reviews in the past years and also some (unnecessary) desk rejects because I didn't know which journal it may fit into (as I said, I had little help, as my PI is basically nonexistent).\n\nI am now allowed major revisions in a (as far as I think) very solid journal that's been around for longer than I am alive. Granted, the IF isn't double-digit, and I've been reviewed in journals with a higher IF already. But I didn't want to give all my hard work to MDPI oder Frontiers just for the sake of getting published, so here we are.\n\nThe review is, of course, very extensive. One reviewer was lazy and basically just put some generic nonsense in there, which shouldn't be too much of a problem. The other one produced 4 pages in font size 10 of comments, which I happily accepted. However, some of the comments are the exact opposite of what the other reviewers in the previous two review processes told me. I did not like the two previous reviews anyways because I just did not fully accept their interpretation of my data. In this review though, although the reviewer makes some tough remarks, I feel like they actually read and understood the paper and helps me to see my data in another way. The review may seem destructive on the outside, but they even helped me out with references (which are definitely not their own work, as I even cited some of those references already, and the others are well-cited papers from well-known names in the field).\n\nIs it a bad thing that I am happy to have them on board? I know a review should not be seen as \"team-work\". But I feel its one of the best guidances I have ever received during my PhD. My plan is to accept about 75-80% of their interpretation of my own data because they clearly know more than me, and this just feels wrong. I even took some of their references and incorporated them into my paper. In some cases they asked me to acknowledge my methodological limitations in the discussion section, which I happily did.\n\nI just need to know if I am doing this wrong, or if this is common?

        "text": "Hi all, I'm frustrated with a situation and am curious to hear the take of the anonymous academic masses. I'll try to present the situation as unbiased as possible.\n\n\nI finished my PhD about two years ago with a relatively high impact manuscript still to be published. It represented the culmination of four years of experiments and a lot of bioinformatics - in my last year of working on it, I worked closely with a postdoc who I really liked and got along with well. At the end of my PhD I knew I was not interested in academia and knew that despite the experiments being complete for this project, there was going to be a lot more work related to actually writing the manuscript and doing the inevitable follow-up experiments once it was under review. Since I had nothing really to gain from another paper (I already had a job lined up in industry), I made a deal with the postdoc that we would share first authorship (his name would be first) in exchange for him taking care of all the rest of it. We told the PI this arrangement and he was fine with it \n\n\nNow you might be thinking my issue is with this postdoc, but it's not! We still get along well. My issue is that in the two years since I graduated, the manuscript is somehow still under review and the postdoc who I made the deal with has also moved on from both the lab and academia. I don't have any details of any arrangements he might have made. In the last 6 months, a person from the lab who I worked with (and is married to the PI, so safe to assume that she and him are on the same page) has started emailing me asking for things related to the work. I made a GitHub repo containing (what I thought was) all the raw data and code related to the project, shared it with the lab when I was leaving, and never heard anything was wrong with it.\n\nIt sounds like they're having trouble replicating some of the experiments that they're trying to do in response to reviewers, which isn't that surprising. I know I did the best science I could with the mouse model they use in the lab, but I think the model is fundamentally flawed because I could never replicate others' work. By the time I came to this conclusion, I was four years into my PhD and it was too late to pivot to anything else. It also happens to be the brain child of the person now in contact with me about the old data, and they never wanted to hear my criticisms of the model.\n\nThis person from the old lab has been emailing me that there were \"inconsistencies\" between their current data and my old data and that they don't have all the analysis scripts that I used. I took a look to see if I have anything, but it's been two years and I don't even have that computer any more. I told them as such and they wanted to have a zoom meeting to try to \"sort it all out\". Since I am fully uninterested, I let them know that they are free to drop me as first author (fair enough, I haven't even seen the manuscript) and in exchange I do not have the bandwidth to meet and try to go through anything with them. They seemed fine with this and dropped it, that was a few months ago.\n\n\nToday I got an email again asking for some data they can't track down and for some visualization scripts that I wrote. I do not have either. I have told them I do not have either. What is starting to really irk me is this underlying accusation of some sort of scientific misconduct - the idea that since they cannot replicate my work, it just be fabricated. Nobody has said this explicitly but it is a heavy subtext. I did not fabricate anything, I didn't even p-hack anything, but I'll definitely admit I was never great at documentation. I am sure it is very frustrating for them to be trying to replicate this and to be going through my old lab notebooks that are probably useless (think \"ran experiment\", with the raw data attached), and I made a point to apologize for that in my last email. Still, it's not my fault the mouse model sucks. So I'm done responding. I've made an effort, it's been two years, I've said they can drop me from the paper. Am I an asshole for just ghosting from here on out?",

The work includes 5 authors (including me) and we have decided to carry on. However, I'm working only with a friend and the other author didn't contribute anything else.  Because we need these other members to have access to the data, is out of the question to remove them. Also, because the first author left for fair personal leaving, we decided to keep him as the first author. I'm also moving from the field of this publication to another marginally related, so, we decided that my friend would stay as the second first authorship and corresponding author and I the last authorship referring as the coordinator.  In brief, I'm the one in charge of the analytical framework and the storytelling of the manuscript. My friend was supposed to provide inputs and review the literature to make sure none of our affirmations are equivocated. After all, we succeeded to submit the manuscript to a good journal in ecology and the manuscript is currently in major review. Now, the conflict starts. Because I'm the one with better English and responsible to carry out the analytical framework I became overloaded with the review process. I handle the introduction and methods and results and my friend was supposed to handle the problems with the discussion. However, he did a terrible job without addressing properly none of the reviewers' comments. So, I needed to intervene in the discussion as well. I spent two entire weeks rephrasing and assessing papers that he was supposed to read but he didn't. In the end, I realized that there were a lot of mistakes that weren't even supposed to occur during the first round of review and I need to fix them. At the end of one month of handling my part and his part, I felt drained and felt the I suppose to deserve the first authorship. Because this is out of range given our previous accordance, I'm considering assuming the corresponding authorship. So, my question is if this really matters something. What are my options to get what I deserved?  \n\n\nSorry for the long answer folks",

I love the research fields of hydrology and especially meteorology, which are the two main branches in the MSc.\n\nWhat I want is to be in this field and be involved explicitly in the measurements to get our research up and running. For me the interesting part is about acquiring proper data so that other people can go do science with that. I'm way more interested in the equipment and and measurement strategies than in doing science with that data.\n\nI have acquired extensive fieldwork and practical experience through my years of study, very much more than my peers. I don't think that's a bragging thing, but it's the thing I enjoy doing and I can do. My peers perform through programming or research or other perks.\n\nI got offered a 2 year position as a junior researcher at our department, setting up field campaigns and measurement sites and being involved with education. However the staff is also pushing towards making those 2 years into 4 years and making me a PhD. \n\nWhat I want to do is to be involved in instrumentation and measurements around our environment. I'ld much rather get an instrument up and running for a scientist than to be the scientist that has to analyse the data from that instrument.\n\nMight be too broad of a question, but should I stay in academia? Should I accept that PhD? Should I just rather go to industry since I'm mainly interested in taking measurements? I would welcome any advice!",

I have achieved an academic pathway that most students would dream of: immediately after finishing my PhD, I was essentially handed a well-paid postdoctoral fellowship at a good university.  Despite this, I want to abandon all my research, never go back to work, and forget that it all ever happened. \n\nThe work is piling up, there's just not enough time for it all, I'm making more and more mistakes and letting my colleagues down.  \n\nIf I'm honest, I never even wanted to finish my PhD; I was simply encouraged by my partner to get the qualification after all the misery I had already invested in it. I thought the money would make the postdoc bearable, but it really didn't. \n\nMy supervisor tells me my position \"is not just a job\". I'm expected to always be available, work 7 days a week, as many hours a day as required. Is this normal? Is it just the way supervisors are? Walking into traffic seems more appealing than going to work tomorrow.",

        "text": "(Apologies in advance if this is off-topic)\n\nI started a PhD programme in the humanites right after graduating my master’s. Getting the position involved moving to a foreign country, and it all happened so suddenly that I spent the first few months there being anxious and homesick. In that state I made a bad first impression on my supervisor, and we developed a toxic relationship.\n\nThings went on like that for a while as I finished most of my course and work requirements, had a paper published, and changed topics twice. At no point did I get very far in writing my monograph, and I felt increasingly like a lazy impostor. \n\nIn 2020, I went down with a severe depression that at the time appeared to be unrelated to my work situation. I went on sick leave for about six months and came back to work when I stopped feeling sad in early 2021. However,  even though I was technically back to work, I got nothing done. The medication I was on made me drowsy and checked out, remote work was lonely, and everything felt so distant and unimportant.  By the time my dose was lowered enough that I felt human again, it was already 2022 and I had less than a year left to finish everything. And yet I got nothing done. I am so tired, so unmotivated, so afraid of writing. \n\nI’m in a system where I have been privileged enough to be paid as a PhD student, but that funding is running out this spring and I can’t afford to continue studying without an income. Working part-time is an option, but in my current state the challenge seems insurmountable. If I can’t handle it now while I still have departmental support and the ability to study full time, how could I possibly handle it while on my own and also holding down a job? \n\nMultiple people have suggested that it’s probably best that I quit, and I think they are right. In a way, I feel relief finally giving up on climbing this mountain. But I also feel immense shame, fear and hopelessness. \n\nBecoming an academic was always my goal, the thing I made all my education choices towards. I was an obsessively bookish kid who couldn’t figure out social situations or manage practical work. Becoming a professor seemed like it was my destiny.\n\nNow I’m in my mid-30s with no work experience and a six year gap in my CV with nothing to show for it. \n\nI’m single, I can’t have children, I don’t have property or connections.\n\nAcademia was always the thing I was good at, the thing that made up for how bad I am at being a human being. Even if I wasn’t passionate about my PhD, it was the only thing I had to be proud of. \n\nWithout it, I don’t know who I am. \n\nHas anyone here experienced something similar? Or have any advise for how to live as an ex-academic?",

I uphold this wholeheartedly! This free dissemination ought to be the norm! \n\nI do NOT refer to snippety one-line answers at the back of a textbook, student solution manuals that solve merely some or half of the exercises, or solution manuals  restricted to instructors. \n\n 1. Robert  Ash (1935-2015), [Preface](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~r-ash/RV/RVPreface.pdf) to [*Real Variables with Basic Metric Space Topology*](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~r-ash/RV.html).\n\n &gt;I rely especially on one of the most useful of all learning devices: the inclusion of detailed solutions to exercises. Solutions to problems are commonplace in elementary texts but quite rare (although equally valuable) at the upper division undergraduate and graduate level. This feature makes the \nbook suitable for independent study, and further widens the audience. \n\n 2. David Patrick, *Introduction to Counting and Probability* (2005), page v. \n\n&gt;However, \nif you are using this book on your own to learn independently, then you probably have a copy of the \nsolution book, in which case there are some very important things to keep in mind: \n&gt;\n&gt;1. Make sure that you make a serious attempt at the problem before looking at the solution. Don't \nuse the solution book as a crutch to avoid really thinking about a problem first. You should think \n*hard* about a problem before deciding to give up and look at the solution. \n&gt;\n&gt;2. **After you solve a problem, it's usually a good idea to read the solution, even if you think you know \nhow to solve the problem. The solution that's in the solution book might show you a quicker or \nmore concise way to solve the problem, or it might have a completely different solution method \nthat you might not have thought of.

        "text": "I’m having my students research how their peers handle basic issues in school like homework, studying, advanced classes, etc. Some of the topics are “How do student athletes cope with homework and studying when they spend a lot of time on their sport?” Or “How prepared do students feel for taking AP classes?”\n\nThis is a dual enrollment composition class at a high school.\n\nI went over qualitative and quantitative research and showed them how to set up Google Forms to collect data. I specifically instructed them to identify who they were, what class this project was for, and the purpose of the surveys. I showed them how to make their Google Forms anonymous and how to see the results of their surveys.\n\nBut I didn’t explicitly prohibit them from making it anonymous.\n\nOne of my students got the idea to make a QR code and post it around the school. Of course, this would be the student that didn’t follow much of anything I instructed. They didn’t identify themselves. They didn’t state the purpose of the survey. They only put “For NoPatNoDontSitOnThat’s Project” at the top.\n\nThey asked for the respondent’s name. Email address. School schedule. Asked about mental health issues. Asked about which classes they hate the most. Asked about teachers they hated the most. Asked if they felt teachers cared about their mental health issues. Even added the question “Can I use your first and last name in the essay?”\n\nI’m completely flabbergasted. They turned in their fieldwork plans prior to sending it out, and I would have never okay’d a topic about mental health issues let alone one that asks for personal information.\n\nFrom what I understand about IRB, if it’s a class assignment, as long as the information isn’t meant to be published or disseminated, anonymous information can be collected. Is that right? If a student doesn’t follow my guidelines, am I still responsible for their actions?\n\nI feel pretty fucked right now. Another teacher sent me an email after seeing the QR code and said I broke all kinds of rules and would be reported. Only area I think I screwed up on was not being more forward about making it anonymous.",

        "text": " Hello everyone!  \n \n\nI hope this finds everyone well. M25 and a final year master thesis student here. I got my undergrad in Computer Science and currently pursuing my masters in computer science, focus Big Data and AI. This post is regarding my master thesis topic.\n\nI must write a proposal, get it accepted, get registered this month for my thesis. For various reasons, I still do not have a topic in hand and time is extremely scarce right now. I am interested in ML and AI in the field of music, image classification, etc.\n\nOn hearing this, people respond with “Research and find something you’ll like doing or interested in” or “Take some time off to figure out what do you want to work in” or “If you don’t get a topic you like working on, you’ll be miserable”\n\nI appreciate this but at this moment, given all the circumstances, I NEED to finish my thesis this semester and I need to do it now. I am okay with working on something I do not like or might make me miserable. What I bring in at this moment is knowledge and readiness to slog my ass off to finish the work. I would prefer working with a company as that will allow me to work on the company project and at the same time, gain some working experience.\n\nI have been applying through links and websites, but the process is taking too long, and time is of utmost importance to me right now. I will be happy to share my resume, show sample codes of my work, etc to people who would want to see it. I am hoping to connect to people who will give me a direction to work in or refer me to someone who could give me a way out of this thesis situation.\n\nSince I am posting this, asking for a very particular help/suggestion, you do not have to respond to this if it is not helpful as of now. I do not mean to be rude here to anyone, but on seeing this people just downvote it because, I do not know, maybe they get offended, or they just do not like it.\n\nPlease don’t do it. I need the post to have a wider reach so that I have a chance of getting help and it is easy to comment something mean or make my post invisible sitting comfortably somewhere behind a screen. \n\nAt this point, a lot of money and time went behind my education. I know the moral grounds of it and that is why, my ONLY priority right now is finishing it on time, and I am ready to give it my all. I will continue applying to companies and doing my own research.\n\nReddit can do wonders when times look bleak and I’m really hoping for a godsend help right now.\n\nThank you for reading this and if you read the entire thing, just drop an upvote so that it reaches more audience.",

Living in China, studying Chinese and meeting friends through these languages has been one of the best endeavors of my life to date.  Long term, it is my goal to be involved in, start, expand, and grow programs that provide students opportunities to learn and build friendship in immersive language environments.  That is what I am interested in for research, and is what I care about.  \n\nI am currently applying to a Chinese linguistics/language pedagogy PhD program, as well as a linguistics program.  Does anyone have any thoughts or suggestions on these fronts?  I expect the Chinese programs would be a bit more interpersonally active, which is something I am greatly interested in, but the linguistics program would offer me a broader path towards other languages and language programs in the future, which is potentially wise given where China, and the lion's share of the Chinese study abroad market, may be headed longer term.\n\nAnyone with experience or insight into either of these that they would be willing to share is greatly appreciated!",

Part of the reasons for this is because my PhD interests are somewhat niched/specialized/interdisciplinary in nature. So as the title says I am looking for a PhD program in the US/Canada that combines Social Sciences with Engineering/Technology. I have always been interested in Social Sciences (Psychology/Sociology, etc) but I have never been able to pursue it through academics. For context, my bachelors degree was in Electrical Engineering and I have Masters Degrees in Integrated Digital Media and I have an MBA. \n\nMy major interests are in finding a program that combines engineering and social sciences that could potentially explore media or business, using data science as a methodology. However just the social science/engineering angle will be enough for me. \n\nI have found [this program](https://idss.mit.edu/academics/ses_doc/#:~:text=The%20Doctoral%20Program%20in%20Social,engineering%20and%20the%20social%20sciences) that satisfies the requirements I am looking for in a PhD program, and I was wondering if you guys could suggest similar programs to this.
