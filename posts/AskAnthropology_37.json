This story is not unique, and Germanic barbarians dominated Iberia, North Africa, France, and Italy. However, only English is considered a Germanic race, and the barbarians generally did not leave an ethnic legacy in these other places. In fact, I recently saw somewhere that modern day residents of Tuscany barely differ from their Etruscan ancestors, and that residents of Iberia are largely identical to those the Romans conquered. In light of this, I was wondering if the Germanic peoples actually had an impact on English ethnicity, and how different that experience is from those under other barbarian kingdoms.",

I'm currently living in Europe in a place where masters degrees are very cheap. My business allows me complete freedom of schedule and I found a university with a Master of Social and Cultural Anthropology. I'm not sure if I will have the pre-reqs or not to get into the program, but if I can the idea of studying anthropology sounds fascinating to me. I've also dabbled in teaching English in a few different countries and loved it and a part of me wishes I could teach instead of do business, but I've just fallen into a pretty comfortable situation in business. I'm also 31 if that makes any difference. What could I expect from a program like this? Any feedback on what I'm considering from people who've studied anthropology would be sincerely appreciated.",

While I get the basic idea of contrasting Locke and the Nuer's solutions to the natural problem of human conflict, I'm still having trouble consolidating those ideas.\n\n\n\nJohn Locke's argument: people naturally fight and feud, and an eye for an eye will go on forever if allowed. Successful societies are the ones that establish government: all individuals agree to place their might behind a body that creates right, and since they all agreed to the rules they established beforehand, the government can judge right and wrong without worry of revenge. \n\n\n\nThe Nuer: when a feud breaks out between two families, it is resolved when one family pays cattle to another family as compensation. It is assumed that, since someone was able to rally his entire family behind him, he has a legitimate grievance that needs to be settled. No need to dictate right and wrong, and no need for everyone to put their might behind a government: the might is already there.\n\n\nI suppose my problem is this: if solving feuds were that easy, then why would Locke's theories hold up at all (aka why would we have government at all?)? What is it about the Nuer's situation that makes them different? They're still patriarchal, they're still war-prone...",

How should we act, as an anthropologist, if we have differing opinions with our informant, that might have sensitive implication?\n\nLet's take an example. Let's say, I'm doing fieldwork with a Salafi Muslim community. I myself am a Muslim, albeit not a Salafi. In that community, they refrain from giving greetings to festivities outside of Islam, be it religious or secular in nature (e.g. no \"Merry Christmas\", no \"Gong xi fa cai\", not even a \"Happy New Year\"). I personally don't find saying greetings as a problem, but they do and don't seem to trust people that do so. For them a Muslim who say \"Merry Christmas\" is no longer a Muslim. \n\nThis pose me to two problems...\n\n1. If they ask my opinions about such greeting - a conversation that I suspect will come sooner or later - should I tell the truth about my opinion about it, or should I avoid answering the question? \n2. In this Salafi group, online interaction is part and parcel of their life and one of the things that I intend to know more. So I need to have them in my Facebook friend lists. The problem with that, it means what I post in Facebook have implications to them. If I post \"Merry Christmas\" in my friends' wall (or in my own) - something that I always do, especially so since I'm a part of inter-religious dialogue organization - they can see it. Should I refrain from doing so? Or should I make a new Facebook account just for research purpose? I'm not sure about the latter as it seems to imply dishonesty as a researcher.\n\nI think as I build my rapport with them, things might be a bit smoother than I'm expecting. But I've been wondering what's the most appropriate way as an anthropologist in conducting research when you have differing opinions that can have serious implication with your informants.\n\nObviously, this is a question from a student doing his first fieldwork.

What were the charactestics of western family 500-1000 years ago?  Were they the same as a typical Indian family now? \n\n2. If so how did they transition from that to the current state? What were the milestones in this transition?\n\n3. Can you suggest some books on this topic?",

How should I approach this meeting in such a way that makes my intention meaningful and genuine? I went to school with many native students who were seemingly anti white and believed we have no culture. They told me we were not good people. I know that tribal leaders In my area are more open minded and understanding of collaboration and community. I just want to make myself not offend them and help as much as possible, especially since I am not as knowledgeable about medicine as my counter parts.

I'm aware that Franz Boas was a major proponent of cultural relativism as a methodology for social anthropology, however, I'm not quite sure how this idea of cultural relativism becomes more of a moral theory. I was browsing the Wikipedia articles on Boas and cultural relativism and came across the ideas of two anthropologists, George Marcus and Michael Fischer who essentially say that after the Second World War, cultural relativism became much more prominent as a moral framework. I can't find more information on how exactly this came about and cultural relativism was taken on as a moral relative position. I was wondering if anyone had more information on how this change of cultural relativism from an anthropological methodology to a moral framework took place. ",

        "text": "I recently graduated with a BA in Anthropology from an R1 with a lot of research experience. I'm actually currently working for my alma matter as a research assistant, but it is only temporary since a faculty member I was working for before hired me to finish some work I started doing for them as a student. I've been looking for jobs to apply to once my contract ends but have found few RA jobs that will hire someone with just a BA and those jobs are never in Anthropology departments. I'm probably being far too picky and have certainly looked in other areas and will apply to that work but I'm wondering if it is possible to find work as an RA; if so, I'll probably keep an eye out for it as I start a new job.",
