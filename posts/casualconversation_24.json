We haven't gone on any trip since 2020 and it feels so surreal to finally be able to go.\n\nI've booked the flight, reserved our room for an entire week, and now I'm looking at the brochures. I can't believe we'll be at a resort on tropical beach for an entire week doing nothing but eating, swimming, and lounging around.\n\nI'm looking at the food there, the places to see, activities to do... this pre-trip planning is just too much fun.

What are you doing?! You’re a bad/aggressive/scary driver.” \n\nI’m generalizing, but like if I stopped short I did it for a goddamned reason.\n\nAnd I know you might be thinking “well that sounds like something a bad driver would say!” I pride myself on my skill behind the wheel.

        "text": "I (18M) was in a rut for the better part of a year. I graduated high school last May and since then, I've had nothing but mental health issues with depression, anxiety, lack of motivation, etc. \n\nI was feeling utterly lost and I was at the point not too long ago where I said \"Screw it, I guess this is how life is going to be,\" and I wasn't going to change anything. The past year, I had been just working, school,  and then sitting in my room for hours on end. Just playing video games, daydreaming, or just watching adult content. \n\nI was constantly spending money on dumb things (which I'm still trying to work on) and it just seemed impossible to pull myself up from what I was doing. And again, I was just going to live with it and just not care about myself pretty much.\n\nThen last week, I had a thought. What if I could change who I am? Would that make me feel better? Of course it would! Let me just totally change my persona and then I'll feel better. Man, was I wrong. In the span of 4 days, I was burnt out. I felt sad, and once again I felt like I couldn't do anything.\n\nTonight, I had another thought and it's my best one yet. What if I just keep the parts of myself that I like, and cut out the parts that I don't or just improve? And I feel so much better! I was following self help YouTubers and what worked for them but they ultimately were too much of a big change for me.\n\nI'm a golden retriever when it comes to energy. I joke a lot, I have fun, and I laugh a lot. At work, in class, with my friends, and watching videos or movies. I love that part of myself. Based on my original thought and the nature of these \"self-help\" videos I was watching, I felt that I had to get rid of everything. And reinvent myself. But everything is there. I just need to put it together.\n\nDo I want to get in shape? Yes! Do I want to go out more? Yes! Do I want to gain more confidence? Yes! But I don't have to take 6 million steps to get there. If I do one thing at a time, everything will fall into place. I believe that I can do what I want without getting rid of my personality. I have ADHD so the \"golden retriever\" comes from the Hyperactivity, and I can learn to control it with time. \n\nI don't have to change because I see others changing, or I want people to like me. I want to change for myself. And I realize that now. So what if I do some weird hobbies? So what if I game at night time and rage while having fun? It's who I am and I will love that part of me to help push me through my life! \n\nI love myself and everyone should, too!",

He is also very doting and patient with SIL you can see it that he is madly in love with her. \n\nWhat really got me upset is my SIL whom I talk to often has started telling me that she is tired of this guy because he “crosses the line” I ask her what she means and she goes “I’ve told him for years he is not and will never be their daddy. So stop acting like it” I told her if she doesn’t love him and gets annoyed by him then why is he her go to guy for everything? That she is giving him a false hope. She went so far as to call him a creep over but didn’t tell me why other than how much he loves her kids. Today we met up for dinner and yet again brought him along even though he’s nothing to her. All I saw was a daddy trying to get the girls to eat and chatting politely with us. I feel like this woman is cruel. But maybe I’m in the wrong here",

That's why even after a successful social interaction with another person or friend, I feel drained afterward. The problem, though, is that if I don't put in this effort (which other people always seem to be able to do effortlessly somehow), all my interactions end up being boring and awkward and nobody wants to hang out with me (I know this from experience, unfortunately). So I'm making this post because I want to know if it gets easier. In other words, if I continue doing this and \"fake it 'til I make it,\" so to speak, will it become more natural for me? Please be honest, and if you have advice that would be appreciated as well. Thanks.",

No way he wants to talk to me. But he was smiling, sometimes touching my back, leaning into me, asking personal questions, making jokes... \n\nAnd then I learned he is actually a friend of the band. He introduced the family and other friends of the band too. It was really cool, but since then I thought he must have been trying to be nice to 'fans' as a friend of the band.\n\nAnd then he asked me if I wanted another beer. I didn't know if I was supposed to give him money(like some kind of trick for me to buy another beer), or he was going to get mine or what. I didn't want to make it awkward so I just said I am ok and I waited for a bit and he wasn't coming so I left. \n\nI wanted to talk to him more, because even though it was a bit awkward he was cute and gentle and knows the band and the owner of the bar. How cool is that! But then, I was afraid that he might be talking to me just because he felt sorry for me sitting alone at a bar.\n\nWhat do you think it was??? Should I have had another beer? Was it just some meaningless conversation? I know I am overthinking here. So please help.",

        "text": "To give some context, I am a graduate student in Computer Engineering. I am an international student who just moved to the USA. Last year I was in Senior year of my college back in India. It just feels like life was so easy back then. There was no academic pressure or anything. After I came to the graduate program, I just realized that there is so much more to engineering. Undergraduate program felt nothing compared to what I am doing right now. In my 1st semester I wasn't adapted to this system of education and I got my GPA less than 3 even after trying very hard. It kind of broke me and I never want to be in that position ever again. I started this semester with a promise to improve myself. Started having a fixed schedule to sleep, eat and study. It was going pretty well in the start. But now when work starts piling up, things are becoming difficult to manage. I am unable to take rest days where I didn't used to do anything, just gave myself a break. I am able to complete work on time but it just feels that there is so much to do. Along with this the tech market is not doing well. Whenever I go into an interview, it just stresses me out. I know nothing serious to stress about as it is only for internships, but I am unable to explain those to my instincts. Last year at this time, I was just too happy thinking about how wonderful life is going to be being away from home, away from parents where there would be no restrictions and there would always be something new to learn. It is fun sometimes, but sometimes it just gets too lonely and only because of all the work I have , I am able to fill that void. I miss my home, my parents and all the friends I had back there. It is not like I don't enjoy what I do but sometimes it just overwhelms me. There are always new friendships and relationships to enjoy.\nI also imagined before coming here, that life would be like a party, I would get wasted often. But it didn't happen like that. I cannot afford to get wasted more than once a month. I don't have that much time to spend. And by wasted I don't mean to get drunk a lot, just enough to enjoy the party and reach back home safely. I never got even more wasted back in India because I had to go back home to my parents. And here I don't get wasted a lot because I am responsible for myself in a new foreign country . It just feels like I am entering adulthood after being a kid for 22 years.",

I have an eating disorder but it’s getting better over the past year, still avoid the kitchen\n\nThe one guy said he uses my pot and he wanted me to wash it. Next day I got round to it, I seen him in the kitchen and was about to start a friendly everyday convo, he said ‘hi’ in a off tone, stopped washing his plates, walked to his Alexa, turned the music off and stormed out of the kitchen. Something a toddler would do\n\nI don’t care about these people, I just don’t want anybody being uncomfortable or hostile for these last few months until I move out to my own studio.

I’ll definitely get rejected but hey, after 12 rejections i think i’ll be fine. Just gotta make sure not to get too invested (hell, me asking her out is already half a joke, i’m really just doing it for the hell of it at this point)",

        "text": "I’m 33 and we’re between the ages of 10-20 during the 00s, so I do understand looking back to your younger days and finding it to be a more simple time compared to paying bills and stuff. I definitely have some fond memories of back then in my late childhood and teen years. \n\nI mostly find it interesting that a lot of Gen Z people born in the 2000s or even the late 90s post things like, “I wish that I would have been older back in the 00s to really get to have experienced teen culture then,” which gets me thinking: most people back then hated it back then. I remember people saying that the decade was terrible at the time and couldn’t ever see the decade being seen as nostalgic. At large, if you were old enough to be socially aware you’d remember how stressful and even scary things were then. The world was quickly changing and back then many felt like not for the better. 9/11 and the war in the Middle East was a pretty prominent frustration and I remember how strained and divisive the country was then. There was a lot of rumors that Bush was going to draft people. My teachers in high school kept saying that Bush was going to start the draft back up. I remember people fretting over the environment. I remember people angry over the war. Sure, we had fun times too, but Gen Z has the tone of what it was truly like back then totally wrong.",

Not hold anything back or be nice :) \n\nI feel like I could be so much better? Like I want to be better but I feel like I’m at level 0 or something. School sucks— mean girls and the whole “food chain” status system is lame (of course I say that being on the bottom); I want to be invited to parties and hang out with the popular kids, I want to be better at fashion, at talking, and knowing how to be more popular I guess idk. So if you can help please please dm :)\n\nI’m looking for someone who can be a friend but also like I said like very blunt and brutal. I respond better to negative reinforcement I learned, so yeah :) it just sticks better in my brain  and I want to do this right. \n\nI’ll tell you more about me in the dm! But for starters my name is Ally and I’m told I’m super gullible, which idrk what it means but they say it means I’m super nice which I think is true! I like being nice and doing things for people so let’s chat! We can be good friends :) \n\n(Mostly looking for female mentors as lot of guys are replying— I’ll delete this when I finally find someone! If you are a guy then you better stand out lol)",

        "text": "Think about it--a virus is spread through biting or possibly by ingesting fluids from an infected individual (blood and saliva for example).  When people become a zombie, they're rather slow and clumsy or they're fast and agile.  Either way, I don't think people would honestly have anything to worry about.  \n\nThe only chaos I can think of that would actually occur is the mass purchasing of everything in stores to stock up.  Aside from that, if one is prepped, all would we have is another mandatory lockdown.  If we see a zombie, walk around them.  If they're too fast, just stay indoors and keep the doors closed and locked.  We'd literally have to wait a week or so for the major issues to be resolved because of the police, military, and other volunteers to rid the area of infected.\n\nThe whole event would probably last for a year or less.  We'll think back on it and say, \"hey, remember that zombie apocalypse we had last year?  That was kinda lame.\"  Sure, people might die and we'll mourn their loss.  In the end, we'll just resume our daily lives after the infection stopped and was treated with a vaccine.  In other words, keep the zombie apocalypse within the entertainment industry since it's more enjoyable.\n\nWhat do you think?",
