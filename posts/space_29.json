I've heard some say back to the first galaxies. That's leads me to think thats the general direction the universe expanded out from. \n\nNow I don't believe there is any reason to think our galaxy is close to the center of the universe, so that would imply looking one direction would be toward the center and the other direction toward the outer  edge. \n\nSo if we can look toward the center and see some of the first light from the big bang, why can't we look the other direction and see the edge relatively speaking? Are we closer to the center than we are the edge and can't see that far yet because it's even farther away than the center?\n\nProbably a dumb question and my understanding of space could be all wrong, so please let me know.",

        "text": "[Paper here, with yours truly as 3rd author!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07880v1) (Note: preprint, we still have to undergo peer review)\n\nTL; DR: new black hole ~3800 light years from us, spotted via a star it's in orbit with!\n\nNow first thing to clarify is, this is truly the lead author's discovery, Kareem El-Badry, who is an amazing astronomer.  What he's been doing is going into the [Gaia catalog](https://sci.esa.int/web/gaia) (which carefully tracks the precise movement of *billions* of sources) and being great at finding \"needle in a haystack\" type things.  In this case, the thing was a red giant star, about the same mass as our sun, orbiting an unseen companion that we've concluded must be a black hole, named Gaia BH2.\n\nHow do you do this?  Well as you might recall, orbital mechanics state that if you have two objects in space gravitationally bound, they will orbit a common point of interest.  When this happens, you'll see the objects \"wobble\" in their movement back and forth over the course of their mutual orbit (which is how we find many exoplanets, in fact!)  What Kareem did, strictly speaking, was find a star with a weird \"wobble\" in the data... and that \"wobble\" indicated the star's orbit was in a period of P= 1277 days, and the companion it was orbiting would be a compact object ~9x the mass of the sun.\n\nNow, a star 9x the mass of the sun would be stupid bright, and very obvious bc this visible star is pretty bright on its own (12th magnitude).  Definitely nothing there in follow-up observations, so it's not a star.  So basically at this point, the argument is \"if only we knew of something that was very massive, so massive light doesn't escape it... oh yeah, a black hole!\"\n\nNow the trick is some black holes *do* emit at low levels, thanks to accreting dust onto them- this happens in closer star- black hole pairs, called [X-ray binaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_binary).  This emission is basically created as particles get close to the event horizon of the black hole, \"feeding\" it, and how we can spot them usually in radio and X-rays.  And, well, we know this star pretty well because we can see it, and every star will have some amount of particles coming off of it in a stellar wind (like the sun does, and how we get the aurora), which is pretty well understood for stars of this type.  So then the question is- is Gaia BH2 emitting at *any* wavelength?\n\nNow this is where I come in, in my role of someone who knows a thing or two about how to get radio observations of weird black holes. :) Kareem is in my institute and came in to tell me about this object a few months ago, and that he'd discovered the *closest* period in its ~3.5 year orbit was happening *this month!* (Yes, that's a bit of luck- in science it's good to be lucky sometimes!) So if you want to detect particles interacting with the black hole, your best chance of seeing it is basically now.  Also, it was a very southern hemisphere object, so not just any telescope can look at it.\n\nSo, what I did was file for emergency time to use the MeerKAT telescope in South Africa, the best telescope on Earth to do this observation, asking for a several-hour observation of Gaia BH2.  Luckily, they agreed and granted the time, so we took a look a few weeks ago! (And I have now officially hung up my shingle as a \"black hole consultant\" btw- my rates are very reasonable! :) )\n\nNow, the bad news is, we did *not* detect any radio emission from Gaia BH2 (nor did the *Chandra* X-ray telescope.) You can see the details in Figure 10 of the paper linked at top.  But the *good* news is this is actually massively helpful, because there is so much we don't understand about black holes!  For example, how does this accretion process work for emission from black holes?  Our data is good enough that we can say most of those stellar wind particles never reach the event horizon- maybe there are strong winds blowing them away, or similar.  Not as exciting as a detection, but still really useful!\n\nAnyway, moving on from that, Gaia BH2 is exciting because as the name implies, it's the second such Gaia black hole- the first being Gaia BH1.  This discovery happened a few months ago ([press release if you missed it then](https://beta.nsf.gov/news/astronomers-discover-closest-black-hole-earth)), and that one happens to be the *closest* black hole to Earth that we know of (and why Gaia BH2 is second- this one has the largest orbit known for a black hole though).  This is *super exciting* because it now implies that these black holes in orbits are actually rather common in space- more common than ones where the black hole and star are closer at this rate!- and the trouble is detecting them. (It's also not clear how they form, so some nice work for theorists to do.) Well, for now- the good news is Gaia is still taking data, and its next data release (in ~2026) will have a *lot* more of these stars with mystery black hole companions in it!  So, guess there will be a lot more to do!",

        "text": "To disprove time travel, a paradox called the Grandfather paradox is used. The paradox says that if you go into the past and kill your grandfather before he married or your father was born, your father would never be born and ultimately you would not be born.  But we can get out of this very cleverly. Here's how:\n\nOK, so, you get a time machine in 2021.... for unknown reasons and you decide to kill your grandfather... for unknown reasons.\n\nYou go back to 1949, when your grandfather was still a child, you kill him successfully.\n\nNow, what happens? Are you alive? Or do you start to disappear slowly into the thin air?\n\nWell... nothing...\n\nYou come back and see everything is normal... but how?\n\nLet's   understand the concept with a Mobius strip. To make one, take a paper   strip, rotate one end 180 degrees and fold it to join it with the first   end. Now, you have a Mobius strip, which, unlike a paper strip, which has two sides, has just one continuous side.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source: Wikipedia](https://preview.redd.it/8ogg4zr17zia1.png?width=200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1e4f03007b7668a2f8000a85252a0e9533dd2ac1)\n\nNow, write an event: \"2021: You are off to kill your grandpa\"  \nAfter a little distance, write: \"1949: Grandfather killed\"  \nAfter a little distance, write: \"1974: Father not born\"  \nAfter a little distance, write: \"2006: Not married\"  \nAfter a little distance write: \"2021: No you to kill your grandpa\"\n\nThen, here come the interesting part:\n\nIf there was no you, this means, you didn't get any time machine, nor you killed your grandfather in the past.\n\nNow, write an event same distance we have been taking since: \"1949: Grandfather alive\"  \nAfter the same distance, write: \"1974: Father born\"  \nAfter the same distance, write: \"2006: Married your mother\"  \nAfter the same distance, write: \"2008: You are born\"  \nAfter the same distance, write: \"2021: Off to kill your grandpa\"\n\nYou'll   notice that the note, \"1949: Grandfather killed\" is just to the   opposite side of what you wrote, \"Grandfather alive\" and other events.   This means that these events happened at the same time and you'll notice   that the line, \"No you to kill your grandfather\" is just opposite to   \"Off to kill your grandfather\". This means you exist and do not exist at   the same time!!\n\nIsn't that just amazing?\n\nThis is how we cleverly get out of the grandfather paradox and prove time travel.\n\n*Note: This is not my idea. I saw it on YouTube from the channel Andrew's Campfire from this video:*  [*https://youtu.be/JmvHNatZgVI*](https://youtu.be/JmvHNatZgVI) \n\n*If you want to understand more about Klein's Bottle and the Mobius Strip, just refer to the video*\n\nThanks for reading!!! Long Live the Incredible Science!",
