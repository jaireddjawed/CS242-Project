        "text": "Inspired by seeing Armageddon Time... James Gray has a weird career in the sense that (as far as I can tell) he’s an American who’s much more popular in Europe than in America. He has 2 nominations for Caesar awards, he won a Venice festival award, most of his movies have played at Cannes, usually if an American has that kind of Wikipedia page they also have American awards. And yet, he doesn’t. No oscar nominations, or golden globes, or anything. His movies aren’t popular with the mainstream audience, which i think is normal for people who make festival dramas, but they’re also not popular with oscar voters and only sort of (?) popular with American critics. \n\nAre his movies not that good, is there something specific about them that holds back Americans from enjoying them, does he have trouble with film distribution, am I crazy and actually James Gray is very popular in film circles, what do you think is going on here? I watch a movie like Armageddon Time and I think it’s pretty good and very based in American history and culture, so the disconnect is really odd to me.",

        "text": "I recently watched it for the first time and thought that there’s no way it could fly today. I do think that casting someone and darkening their skin and changing their features to try to make them look like another race or ethnicity is unnecessary in film when you could simply find someone who actually fits that description to play the role. That being said, Linda Hunt’s performance was incredible. But since I don’t know much about Jakarta, or the people that live there, I was wondering what others thought about her performance? Does it lean into stereotypes? Is it harmful?\n\nAlso, if there’s one thing about the profession of acting, it’s that its entire purpose is to place someone different from yourself. You create a character separate from you and you portray them to the best of your ability. It just gets complicated when we start bringing in race and ethnicity. There are tons of actors that have played people outside their race or ethnicity but because they were more ethnic, no one really talks about it much or cares as long as they give a meaningful performance. Most likely people of color casted in those roles were probably only offered roles like that because a lot of white filmmakers or casting people probably don’t know the difference between a lot of cultures and think that they look close enough. \n\nAnyways, I’ve gone off into a tangent but I’m just curious to know other peoples thoughts. \n\nTLDR; is Linda Hunt‘s portrayal of Billy Kwan harmful?",

        "text": "I watched Gaslight for the first time the other night and thoroughly enjoyed it - a wonderful film that I highly recommend. But … I do have one nerdy question:\n\nTowards the end of the film there is a scene where Brian (Joseph Cotten) is wrestling a gun away from Gregory (Charles Boyer). The gun goes off, Gregory drops it and the two men run up to the attic and can be heard fighting. At this point we see Paula (Ingrid Bergman) calling upstairs to find out what’s happening. During this shot the pistol that Gregory dropped is very clearly visible lying on the carpet, but we never see the gun again. Even when Paula goes up to the attic and confronts a tied up Gregory, I kept waiting for her to take out the pistol but it’s not referred to or mentioned again in the film. \n\nSo my question - is this literally a case of violating “Chekhov’s Rule” never to bring a gun onstage unless it’s going to be fired? Was there maybe a scene with the gun that wound up being cut?  I find it hard to believe that an accomplished director like George Cukor would make an obvious continuity error like that, but that’s possible too. Any thoughts?",

        "text": "The discussion surrounding adaptations of written works is always a curious one. The shift from a novel, where the whole of the events are described and imagined by a reader, to a film adaptation where the individual vision of a filmmaker becomes fundamental to how the media is then received is one that will always involve change, this is not an unpopular or original statement. Many aspects of a novel simply do not translate to a film effectively and often it is the case that adaptations which change freely are more worthy thematic adaptations than if they had simply done everything as it was described. Yet, frequently, fans of a novel or of a series of novels will complain about an adaptation purely for its changes rather than whether or not the change still works thematically.\n\nApocalypse Now is notable for its fundamental changes to its source material, changing the entire setting not only from time but of place. Despite altering the whole of *Heart of Darkness* from a framing standpoint, the film remains remarkably true to the overall thematic center of the work and is a rare film that adapts the spirit and pathos of a work not only for a new time but for a new place and context. My father, himself a green beret veteran who served in Vietnam, always held Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket (itself an adaptation) as the two films which came closest to capturing the spirit of the war as he knew it, many veterans today report similarly regarding the essence of their experiences and representation in media, even when said media is not depicting their own war. Some experiences and certain spirits of conflict persist regardless of setting and there is no greater example to this than *All Quiet on the Western Front*.\n\nErich Maria Remarque's 1928 serialized novel, known in German as *Im Westen nichts Neues*, *Nothing New in the West* and better known by its more creatively translated english title *All Quiet on the Western Front*, is perhaps the most culturally impactful novel when it comes to the collective awareness of the First World War in modernity, especially following the conclusion of the Second World War. It is a story of a mundane group of friends taking part in a war vastly beyond both their initial conception of it and their comprehension while partaking. The war claims most of their lives and breaks those that it does not kill, all of whom pass without any greater acknowledgement or change.\n\nThe characters of the novel do not fight in famous battles or take part in actions that have names which may be read about, they do not go to any particular places that are noted or observed, they do not interact with figures who would later achieve certain historical relevance, and they do not lead lives in the war that would ever be immortalized. They live and die in a war along with millions like them and all is unchanged by their passage, with the only ones to take notice are their dwindling comrades. It is a story of insignificant and unpreventable death in an uncaring world, a story of a war as it was experienced by one unremarkable and unremembered soldier. Remarque was not a national hero for his service and, were it not for his literary works, little of his wartime experiences would have ever been known and none of it would have been examined.\n\nThe two previous adaptations of the work handle these themes quite maturely and, to some varying degrees, effectively. I am more fond of the 1979 made-for-tv adaptation than I am the 1930 adaptation, though there is a certain authenticity in the latter, with many of the film's personnel, including actors and extras, having served in the very war they were recreating for the screen. The new 2022 adaptation of the novel, directed by Edward Berger, is one that is not so much an unwatchable film in that any individual elements are incompetent, indeed, it is an extraordinarily competent film. Its acting, editing, cinematography, soundtrack, and sound design are all quite excellent, it is clear that a lot of competent and hardworking people worked for a long time to make this film work. Where it completely fails, however, is in being an actual adaptation of the work upon which it is based.\n\nIn the end, the newest All Quiet on the Western Front film is a decent war picture but a lousy adaptation of its source material that both does nothing to justify or dignify its existence as yet another adaptation and actively undercuts the main pathos of Remarque's work.\n\nAs stated earlier, changes made in a medium shift are expected and are not an issue inherently, *All Quiet on the Western Front* is a curious film, however, in that almost all of its changes also change the very center of the work. The most impactful is the ending, but there are a number of changes besides it which are very curious or outright remove entire themes from the story.\n\nThe first half of the novel gave me high hopes. Despite the removal of characters like Kantorek, there is a true sense of Paul’s innocent friendship which begins his wartime experience. This falters very quickly due to a number of factors stemming from strange cuts to many events being placed into one to the whole of the story being condensed for some unknown reason. Where in the novel extended attention is paid to the boots acquired and the significance around how they are acquired first by Müller and then by Bäumer, the film cuts this entirely, with a slight stand-in taking the form of the handkerchief but even this is given only momentary significance. This change, coupled with the removal of most scenes between Paul and his friends in mundane circumstances, removes the notion of camaraderie and friendship that is so key to the relationship between the main characters in the book. He has friends, those friends die, and save for some muddy staring shots this is the last that is seen. With many of his friends dying early and without later mention, it is a curious choice when one considers the drawn out and, often, random series of events in the novel.\n\nThis is further reinforced by the removal of Kantorek and Himmelstoß. With the former, we lose from the progenitor of Paul and his friends’ participation in the war and the notion of a war fought by men convinced of its righteous purpose by men who will never place themselves in it, and with the latter, we lose any possible foil to this in a character who is a coward and seemingly more than happy for others to die if he will survive who later reforms himself and shows genuine bravery and care for those in the same war as him. The true sense of camaraderie that keeps Paul from fully giving into despair in the novel is broadly gone with these changes except at the very end when everything is then rushed together and condensed into a forty eight hour period. Rather than a gradual development of ruined men and destroyed hope, we instead have a film which seems to be, at all times, engrossed with an aesthetic of mud and blood and cares very little for the humans fighting in and spilling both.\n\nMost curious of all is the change to the ending. Where the events of the film’s conclusion play out over several months, in the film it is all crushed into what seems to just be a few days. With the war’s end looming on the horizon (another matter which will be discussed shortly) Paul and his friends partake in an assault which sees them subjected to all horrible maladies of a trench assault including flamethrowers, bayonets, and tanks, all of this taking place with constant fetishistic shots of Paul and his friends stacking bodies like soup cans at a homeless shelter. This attack sees most of Paul’s remaining friends die various horrible deaths and directly precedes a scene which, besides Paul’s death, is the most overtly misdone portion. In the novel, specific attention to killing is only ever given as Paul stabs a man to death in a shell hole and is then forced to sit there and watch as he bleeds to death in agony. Over the course of his death, Paul is unable to turn away from the realities of what he has done and pleads with both the man and with an uncaring higher power that his actions might be undone, that he can do anything to alter the course of events he has created, and is unheeded as the man eventually succumbs to his wounds, leaving Paul alone. \n\nHe shoots his rifle several times of course but this is really the only time actual detail is given to the act of killing by Paul, and it is in an act where both Paul and the audience cannot simply look away. He hasn't shot a silhouette on the horizon and wondered if, when it fell from his vision, the figure was dead or simply wounded, instead he's trapped with him and faces the first man he has ever killed with his own hands as he bleeds and chokes out his last. There is nothing between the two men that makes them hate each other, and yet one has killed the other and wonders what this means and why it had to be, pleading to help him against the inevitable that he has set in motion. In this film, Paul has already killed several men in such a fashion, whether by shooting men at near point-blank range, running them through with his bayonet, or hacking them to pieces with his spade. The meaning behind the poilu’s death at his hands is lost when the film shows Paul to already be a stone killer. This is not his first time killing a man, it is not even the first time he can say he has killed a man with his hands. There is no moment where Katczinsky and Kropp console him that this is simply what they are there to do while an ecstatic sniper scores another kill behind them, jumping for joy as he does. Paul, already a manslayer, again looks exceedingly forlorn within the mud and blood of the battlefield, and then wanders back to find the final moments of the war.\n\nTjaden, in this adaptation, has his death seemingly stand in for Kroop’s wounding but, unlike both his and Kroop’s counterparts in the novel, he then kills himself with a fork rather than be sent home a cripple. It is an odd scene, one which seems to function more to remove the final friend Paul has, save for Kat, than it does any true narrative purpose. I do not find myself seeing his suicide as a meaningful improvement beyond granting the film yet another tick on the “bleak” aesthetic. Where his friends slowly die or are removed with no awareness of their fates afterwards, all of this is left to the very end and I suspect Tjaden’s sudden suicide was the result more of this than any true story being told.\n\nKat’s death is the most curious. Of all of Paul’s friends, Katczinsky is the one whose death finally leads to him rejecting any earthly care remaining, meeting his own eventual death without fear or care. Yet, again, because the film rushes everything to a final miserable two days, his death is similarly rushed and, honestly, extremely odd. His death in the novel is a random and unpreventable moment in the war. Upon stabbing the poilu to death, Paul thinks to himself how if any one moment had been different than so many people had known, including his recent stabbing victim, would have continued living and might have survived to live many more years, yet for entirely random moments, they instead die. So too is this true for Katczinsky, who dies of shrapnel from a shell, slowly bleeding to death as Paul brings him back to an aid station. Of the many characters in the novel, most die without truly affecting their fate, with only Detering truly creating his own fate. In that sense, Kat’s death in the film is closer to him than it is his book counterpart. Rather than dying randomly in the war, he now dies because of a teleporting child who opens up a side by side on him for stealing from his farm again. It’s a completely perplexing and preventable death that has no relation to the war beyond the fact that they are only there because of the war. I have no clue why this was added beyond a sense of dramatic irony that Kat dies on the last day due to his ever-present search for food. \n\nOnce again, because all is condensed in this telling of the story, Paul has no time to absorb this and the passage of time for the death’s weight to sink in is limited to minutes, which leads then to probably the most blatantly poor change in the ending.\n\n Rather than dying on a quiet day in October of 1918, Paul now dies on the eleventh of November, right at the end of the war, in a final desperate charge done at the behest of a rabidly patriotic officer, where he fells nearly a half dozen French soldiers before his death. This, I believe, removes the thematic whole of the work. Paul's death in the novel is meaningless and unremarkable, much like those of all of his friends, and much like the millions of others who died in the First World War. Having lived through the conflict that has claimed most of his friends and all of his innocence, Paul finds himself nearing the end of the war but is caught up in a day that is serene and remarks that he no longer fears whatever is to come and takes no steps to alter what might result from his own life. He stands and a final note informs us that he died on a quiet and peaceful day, with a final line reflecting both the meaninglessness of his death and the overall unchanged nature of the conflict. Despite his death, the army reports that on that day there was nothing new, all was quiet. He dies unremembered and unnoticed, much like all of his friends.\n\nMaking his death remarkable or even glorious and as part of a wider mad charge robs his death of its significance, as the significance of his death and, for that matter, of those of most of the characters seen, is in its lack of significance. They do not fight in battles which have names, they do not die as heroes or as martyrs, they simply die and the rest of the war continues as though they had never been. Now, however, he dies a final horrible and glorious death, killing every man he sees and only falling as a final blow strikes him through the heart as the clock strikes 11:00, his body later being discovered by a young man he saved in an earlier scene. “Im Westen nichts Neues” becomes “Im Westen *alles* Neues”, and Paul’s death is not only glorious but the last death of the war as it can be seen, a final martyr whose blood waters the field of the war’s end.\n\nTo that point, the film also has a strange fascination with telling a wider story of the end of the First World War. At multiple points the film halts to show an abridged version of the process by which the 1918 armistice was signed, giving attention both to the real life characters of Matthias Erzberger and Ferdinand Foch, along with others, and a fictional character who serves as a stand-in for a collective personification of overzealous Imperial German officers unable to stomach a peace and their own irrelevance in such a time. During these scenes I found myself nearly shouting at my laptop screen that this is ought to be Paul’s story, and Paul’s story has no awareness of the war at large, with this being expressly noted during a conversation when he is at home after his initial service. \n\nAs stated earlier, Paul and his friends do not fight in battles with names or in any particular places, they simply partake in a war. They have no way of knowing the effect, if any, they have on it, and broadly speaking the war simply happens and they try to survive and wonder when it will be over. Instead of this, we get a cobbled together cast of new characters trying to tell a wider story of the war which cuts off as unceremoniously as the rest of the film. Attention should not have been given to anyone outside of Paul’s story, as the point of Remarque’s work is that it is the perspective of one who fought the war not knowing any impact or significance had by anything. The war began and it ended one day, and all that many soldiers knew was that, while they had not changed the war, it had certainly changed them.\n\nThis was an experience shared by many, even to this day, and is part of the reason his work is enjoyed now as it was when he first published it. Now, however, everything is granted significance and we are told directly what it all means, what it is all a part of, and what the stakes are in every engagement. It is as though one detested in entirety the central framing of the source material.\n\nOn the whole, instead of a story of a nation's young men destroyed and forgotten by a war, it becomes a glorious and ultimately tragic adventure film, and I find myself wondering why filmmakers chose to adapt this work at all if they had no interest in adapting anything fundamental to it. What we get is a predictably bleak WWI film filled with plenty of mud and blood and which possesses a plot loosely taken from a novel by Erich Maria Remarque and whose characters happen to share names with characters in that novel but which is not only an unfaithful adaptation, it is not truly an adaptation of anything resembling the work. \nThe movie is, I suppose, a decently entertaining war movie, but it's the most unworthy film adaptation of this particular war story that's ever been put to film as it has nothing at all to do with the themes that made Remarque's work resonate with audiences in 1928 as they do today.\n\nI have purposely avoided reading the reviews by other people, so beyond the discussions with my friends and colleagues, I have no wide awareness of how this film has been received, but I hear it is up for many awards and is being widely lauded. I cannot imagine why and find myself perplexed at how it may be viewed as a meaningfully effective telling of Remarque’s work beyond superficial resemblances. While it offers a competent war film, *All Quiet on the Western Front* it is not.",

        "text": "Hello all,\n\nI just watched Beginning (2020) by Déa Kulumbegashvili and I found it to be a beautiful film that elegantly yet powerfully portrays its story of the wife of a Jehovah Witness leader in an unwelcoming, hostile, predominantly-Christian Georgian community where she endures patriarchial suppression from both sides. \n\nSPOILERS AHEAD:\n\nI think I understood the majority of the movie - having seen Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975), I see the inspiration/homage of the drugery/silent oppression of women portrayed through long, aesthetically-pleasing, crisp shots. I was also really impressed with the constant tension the movie held from its first scene (personally I felt that something was going to happen suddenly, but I was not anticipating the molotov cocktail and subsequent fire). I saw the clear-cut violence and terrible treatment of women - from Yana's rape to her husband constantly belitting her, ignoring her, only caring about her rape in the context of what the Jehovah Witness elders would think, Yana's mother explaining the terrible treatment she endured by Yana's father - this all made sense to me (but I would love to hear others thoughts).\n\nWhat somewhat loses me is the ending. Yana poisons and kills her only son, Georgi, and informs her husband calmly. In the next shot, we see her rapist (the alleged detective from Tbilisi) suddenly become stricken and lying down on a dried riverbed, turning into sand and sinking into the crevices.\n\nWhen I first saw this scene, I thought I understood Yana's intentions of killing her son. First, perhaps she felt powerless - the police at best refuse to help her/her \"community\", at worst they are the active rapists/arsonists who directly inflict violence and pain; her husband at best is a bad husband who asks for her opinions only to directly ignore them if they conflict with what he wants, at worst he is the other side of the same coin in that he doesn't care about her well-being, only what she can do for him in terms of his career/religious goals. So I thought her killing her son would be her attempt at freedom, by killing the only thing she loves/cares about in the world she is protected. Men can harm her, her body, her place of worship, but they can never harm her son, she has taken that away from them.\n\nBut this interpretation doesn't make sense with the following scene of the rapist detective turning to sand. Upon seeing the next shot, I wondered if there was a correlation between the two, which draws back to the original sermon speech Yana's husband delivers about Abraham killing his only son, Isaac. \n\nCan someone help me apply this framework to the ending? I was born a Christian but never learned anything about it, so I'm not well-versed. My understanding was that Abraham was told to kill his only son as a test of God, to see if he was truly loyal to God and that he would not question his faith. Was Abraham ever rewarded for his loyalty/faith in the sense he got revenge or someone or something crumbled to sand/salt? Did Yana kill her only son to prove her faith? It didn't seem like she was struggling with her faith in the film, but to be fair a lot of Yana's inner thoughts are hidden from us. \n\nIn the end, my quick and dirty interpretation is that Yana killed her son to prove her faith, and she was rewarded with her rapist's \"demise\" if you would call it that.\n\nWhat are your thoughts and interpretation to the ending of Beginning (2020)?

        "text": "So, as you can see from the community flair next to my username, Michael Haneke is my current favourite director (tied with Lynch, really). Anyway, I was reading his Wikipedia page and noticed that it said that he is a professor at the Vienna Film Academy. \n\nThis led to me discover that not only does Haneke himself teach at the Vienna Film Academy but that his long-time cinematographer Christian Berger does too and so does Jessica Hausner, who is another highly regarded Austrian director (her 2004 horror film Hotel is really underrated btw if the you’re looking for Arthouse horror). Personally, this has to be one of the most absurdly stacked staffs at a film course when it comes to acclaim, experience, and notability (don’t get me wrong though, I love the film academics and lecturers at my university who are more focused on criticism). \n\nWhilst, I obviously don’t plan on in enrolling the academy (some major factors holding me back being the fact I can hardly speak a word of German and my own filmmaking amateurishness) and because I am much happier in Australia and feel that thanks to the internet and steaming, watching Haneke’s films and interviews is enough of an education. However, a tiny part of me is a bit jealous thinking about the dozens of students receiving such insanely qualified lecturers and tutors (only joking, of course). \n\nI thought it might be interesting to ask this subreddit, what do you guys think about directors teaching film? Haneke and many others began as critics, but do you think there would be more value in a self-taught director becoming a professor rather than a published and highly read academic? And, out of interest, do you know of any other high-profile directors or film creatives involving themselves so heavily with teaching whether it be at present or historically (beyond delivering the odd lecture)?",

        "text": "I had a weird issue walking out of Dune. I liked the movie but was incredibly distracted by the Sandworms. Now, I know this isn't a filmic problem persay. It's not about technique - but there is something which makes me wonder how otherwise very competent filmmakers can ignore certain consequences in their ... how should one say ... motivations for creatures/villains.\n\nBoth Nope and Dune feature alien creatures. And both, it seems to me, ignore any idea of caloric intake-output.\n\nThe sandworms in Dune can hear footsteps on sand. These small vibrations summon them to arrive and eat our protagonists. But what this implies is that these creatures need to eat to survive. They are hunting. Which means they have some basic need of calories which means they have a metabolism and, probably, need to defecate as well.\n\nSo on what biological terms would it make sense for a giant worm - the size of a skyscraper - to move its entire mass through sand (a very difficult substance to pass through) just to swallow a single human creature? The amount of caloric expenditure would vastly outweigh the caloric gain.\n\nRecently watching Nope I had a similar issue. There is one moment where this predator spaceship swallows up forty humans in one go - which makes sense and seems to me like that's what it should've been doing the whole time (I mean, who's gonna stop it?) But then it goes back to trying to swallow individual humans? Can one imagine the energy expended for such small rewards? Flying around - making hairpin turns. Unless that technology is very very advanced (advanced to the point where it shouldn't require biological calories on the same terms as other biological beings). It'd be like climbing a very tall hill to eat a cricket.\n\nOk, I know it's not the point of these films. And yet I find it incredibly distracting.",

        "text": "In the last year, I've watched a number of Werner Herzog's core narrative films and have been drawn to his approach to storytelling. He is one of the best examples of substance over style and simply presents us with information and introduces us to characters that have a trajectory that is entirely dictated by their actions. There is a certain realism to their development that makes his attraction to documentary filmmaking seem very obvious.\n\nGrizzly Man was my first foray into his documentaries and Timothy Treadwell truly feels like one of Herzog's characters. A man whose destiny was decided by his actions. The match feels inevitable. Ignoring Treadwell's uncanny likeness to longtime collaborator Klaus Kinski, his mannerisms and his passions are very reminiscent of the characters Aguirre and Fitzcarraldo. All three are also trying to bend the untamed world to their own views. The parallels allow us to look at how Herzog feels about his characters, given that he is able to comment directly on it in the documentary format.\n\nThe film also touches on Treadwell's time spent aimless and drunk; wasting away until he discovered the bears. This recalls the other side of Herzog's character studies--ennui. Bruno Stroszek comes to mind, though he was never able to escape his pain, we are led to believe that Tim Treadwell truly did overcome his vices after finding something to live for. One could argue that he just replaced one addiction for another, but I like to think it was more than that.\n\nComparing Tim Treadwell to Aguirre or Fitzcarraldo doesn't really sing praises to the man, but it is all in what drives them and their stubborn persistence against the current. Fitzcarraldo firmly believed what he was doing was going to improve lives and Aguirre saw himself as the only one who could lead the expedition. Both qualities can be seen in Treadwell as well as the fact that all three ultimately came from a place that was inherently somewhat selfish. They all struggled with a God complex. Tim's intentions were good and his heart was in the right place. He may have not always gone about it the right way, but his passion was pure and the main problem lay in how he attempted to force that passion on an unwilling nature. In spite of this, Treadwell constantly reminds us that he knows what he is doing is dangerous, but that he is willing to die for (or by) the creatures he loves. Herzog makes a distinction between Treadwell the man and Treadwell the persona and he shows us both sides instead of painting a clearly positive or negative picture. Just like his narrative films, he presents us with the information to decide for ourselves how we perceive them.",

        "text": "This is something very interesting. In case you didn't know, 'Saw' broke onto the scene in 2004 as an indie film made by two Australian no-namers, and it was a brilliant success at Sundance Festival, and went on to be get a theatrical release, where it made big numbers. \n\nContrary to what most people think, the original 'Saw' was not a gratuitiously violent torture flick, but rather a psychological character study, and mystery in the vein of Seven. A very unique film.\n\nUpon opening weekends success, 'Saw 2' was greenlit and it was as good as the original, if not better. \n\nThe epic twists in these first two films would become something to be expected with each passing sequel. Unfortunately, after 'Saw 2', the films took a nosedive in quality, culminating in Saw 7 in 2010.\n\nSeven years passed, and it 2017 we had an official reboot called 'Jigsaw', with a new writing team of Josh Stolberg and Pete Goldfinger. \n\nI had never heard of them, but was intrigued and open minded. The aim was to recapture that initial spark that brought 'Saw' into popularity with it's first 2 movies during their hey-day.\n\nSadly, that didn't happen as 'Jigsaw' was widely panned by fans and critics alike. It was terrible.\n\nA few years later, in 2021, we had yet ANOTHER reboot come into the fold with 'Spiral', featuring Chris Rock and Samuel freaking Jackson. \n\nI had high hopes for this one; the trailer looked incredible, the plot synopsis was very intriguing and they brought back the director/writer from 'Saw 2', so I was elated... only to be severely let down.\n\nAkin to 'Jigsaw', 'Spiral' was widely panned and didn't make any splash upon release, and hasn't since. It was actually worse than 'Jigsaw' in every way. The story was terrible, very weak writing.\n\nA quick internet search would show that the SAME writers of 'Jigsaw' also wrote 'Spiral'.\n\nIf you look at Stolberg and Goldfingers filmography, they've literally NEVER written anything good, so it's truly a mystery why these guys were even hired to write not one, but TWO attempts at a reboot in a row. \n\nNobody should be given that luxury. You failed once, you should be let go and a brand new creative team should be brought on for the next reboot.\n\nYet, here I am, dumbfounded that we have 3rd reboot attempt in 5 years, and lo and behold, Stolberg and Goldfinger are returning as writers, again.....???!!!\n\nI'm truly baffled why the studios would even bring these guys back. Why give someone who's never been a proven skilled screenwriter, three chances at a reboot of a very valuable franchise with loads of potential and an existing IP?\n\nI'm very curious to see this new 'Saw' film, which comes out next October, but don't expect it to be any better than the last two films; below average, dull movies. \n\nI'm completely dumbfounded why the studios would bring back the same writers that gave them failed reboots, instead of looking for some new creative energy and a skilled creative team. \n\nAnyone at all, please enlighten me. I'm genuinely curious why this happens.",

        "text": "Scott Pilgrim vs the World is a pretty great movie on a lot of levels.  Unfortunately, it's also a film centered around the wanton indulgence of the young male ego.\n\n From start to finish, Scott acts exclusively in self interest, and learns almost no meaningful lessons short of some trite 'accept yourself' cop-out. Scott's behaviour around knives and Ramona ranges from really fucking creepy, to dumb as a rock. Rarely does the film treat this as anything other than a personality quirk.\n\nThe film seems uninterested in meaningfully exploring how Scott's stupidity and meekness affect those around him, and the age gap in his relationship with knives, while addressed, is really not given enough criticism in the film. \n\nInstead of unpacking how Scott is just the absolute worst to women, the movie decides to unpack Scott blaming his myriad personal flaws on his ex girlfriend, and on this front, the self acceptance ending makes sense. Scott has acknowledged he is responsible for his flaws, and he alone can fix them. \n\nThis wouldn't be quite so much of an issue if the ending didn't then go on to have Scott literally fuck off to go hang out with himself and talk about how great he is, leaving both women who he's betrayed and emotionally abused totally unsupported. He literally just leaves without suffering any consequences for any of his actions.\n\nThe central lesson of this movie (even if it wants you to think otherwise) is that if you're a deeply mediocre, sad young man, you can act like a complete fool and creep, cheat on two women at once, date an underage girl as an adult, and generally offer nothing of value to anybody around you, and it's all totally okay, so long as you love yourself. \n\nThat's actually fucked up. \n\nScott pilgrim is funny, brilliantly directed, and a visual masterpiece, but the script is all kinds of garbage for the message it (seemingly by accident) sends.",

For a fully illustrated version click here - [https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/shakti-samantas-sawan-ki-ghata/](https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/shakti-samantas-sawan-ki-ghata/)\n\nI don’t know what happened to the print of this film but it looks wacky. It may have been digitized and the saturation turned up too high, way too high, but that doesn’t explain the weird blurs and sudden murky drops in sound where everything sounds like it is underwater. Whatever trauma the reels went through, it serves *Sawan Ki Ghata* well. It turns a pretty good Bollywood musical into a bizarre spectacle of color.\n\nI’m not sure if it is a result of the visual enhancement or if the makeup artist had cataracts, but everyone looks made up like a clown. Their cheekbones bulge with rosy bruise-like spots, their eyes are outlined like they belong in a silent movie, and the base makeup stops at the chin, leaving a gaping mismatch between their face and neck.\n\n Then there are the costumes. In a typical Bollywood musical, every new scene is accompanied by a new outfit, mostly for the ladies. In many Bollywood films, there are new outfits for almost every shot which can be confusing, but Bollywood films are confusing anyway. I am afraid that *Sawan Ki Ghata* falls short in the costume arena. The outfits are great but there are far too few changes. \n\n For me, the 1970s were the golden age of Bollywood. The colors are garish and plentiful, the dance numbers are campy, but best of all is the music. Since Bollywood began making musicals, it has slowly slid away from traditional Indian music with sitars and tabla toward a more western pop sound. There is nothing wrong with the modern, pop sound, but for me, there is a sweet-spot in the 70s where the traditional instruments are blended with some synths, and drums, along with a symphony orchestra to create a strange but groovy stew, or should I say curry.\n\nSpeaking of which, the leading man, Gopal, is half Indian, half Elvis, and if you include his ruby red lips maybe 10% Marilyn Monroe. Harder to explain is the fact that the inside of his mouth is redder than his lipstick. Either he has been sneaking a little betel nut on the sly, or they made him suck on a lollipop between takes.\n\n He has the crooner pompadour and the Elvis swagger but even better is his singing (or Mohammed Rafi’s singing). It blends Elvis’ smarmy ballad style with traditional Indian styles to create a truly wonderful whiny hybrid. Mohammed Rafi is one of the greats and the soundtrack for this film was very popular in its time.\n\nThe whole soundtrack is particularly melodic. Often dance numbers emphasize rhythm but *Sawan Ki Ghata* has a few extra slow love songs which feature a more fluid style.\n\nGopal’s antagonist is the evil Mr. Kailash. In an American western, the bad guy wears a black hat, but in Bollywood, it’s all about the evil eyes, as evidenced in the stills below. \n\n As is typical of Bollywood, the villain is a bit cartoonish. He has a Superman curl of hair that falls in his eyes, and he punctuates each of his sentences with a dramatic whip of his head to sweep the hair back into place. Silly he may be, but Mr. Kailash ushers in some unexpectedly dark events. It’s not every Bollywood film that includes rape followed by suicide.\n\nAlong with the saturated colors, *Sawan Ki Ghata* has some other very strange visual qualities. There are unpredictable patches of soft focus that slide around as if the print is warped. Sometimes the whole frame falls out of focus. Some of it is definitely intentional. There are plenty of dewy, soft-focus closeups of our lovely young ingenue. There are also patches of blur that will suddenly surround the main characters. It looks deliberate, but the effect is a bit nauseating.\n\n  I suspect these effects are simply being overdone or badly done, and in more subtle hands wouldn’t be so disorienting. Intentional or not, they end up enhancing the film. The color, the exaggerated makeup, the strange effects, and the terrible camera movement, imbue the film with a special otherworldly atmosphere that keeps you on your toes. \n\n The title, *Sawan Ki Ghata,* refers to the monsoon season and the accompanying holiday. The 31 days of Sawan begin halfway through July and last through the first half of August. The holiday commemorates when Shiva, the god of destruction, saved the universe by drinking a deadly poison. It’s complicated, but he drinks the poison which makes him turn blue.\n\nDuring Sawan. Hindus offer milk and water to Shiva to help ease the poison. To an outsider, it looks a little unsettling. The faithful gather around a giant, black, stone phallus called a lingam which represents Shiva’s penis, and cover it with milk. Sounds strange, but, It’s no stranger than Christians eating Christ’s body or Jews cutting the tip of their penises off.\n\nThere are references to Shiva, the lingam, and the monsoons throughout the film. Many scenes are interrupted with flashes of lightning and thunder, but as far as I can tell there isn’t a subtext referring to the specific Shiva myth.\n\n Shiva is one of the oldest gods in existence (or not existence if you prefer). He has many faces, both literally and figuratively. Hindu gods are always full of contradictions. Shiva is the ultimate ascetic, but he loves to dance. He is the destroyer, but it is through Shiva’s destructive power that creation is made possible. It’s all fascinating, but I think his role in the film is minimal. The idea is the monsoon season is not only significant but volatile, which makes for good underlying tension.\n\n*Sawan Ki Ghata* was directed by Shakti Samanta the founder of Shakti films. He and his company have made a long list of films including some big hits like *China Town* (1962), *Kashmir Ki Kali* (1964), and *An Evening in Paris* (1967). *Sawan Ki Ghata* ends up feeling like a mannerist, musical, melodrama but with all the genre tropes neatly arrayed in their proper places. Watching genre films is like sex. You need the right buttons to be pushed in the right order, but variation makes it worthwhile.",

        "text": "I finally watched I Vitelloni yesterday after I realized with La Strada (1954) that post war Fellini excites me more than his later and most known works. It was undoubtedly one of those movies that I lost myself for almost two hours and became a part of the characters and the story. And like every time I watch a great film, I searched I Vitelloni on this page and surprisingly couldn’t find enough posts that talk about the movie. \n\nI believe I Vitelloni deserves a separate posts with a deep analysis. However, I am not going to try something that I’m not good at. But I want to talk about the incredible similarity of I Vitelloni and Scorsese’s Goodfellas.  \n\nFirst of all, I am a huge fan of Martin Scorsese. He is not one of my favorite directors but he is someone I can listen for hours. His knowledge about film history and his passion about the industry is something that inspires you singlehanded. So, I remember Scorsese distinctively talking about I Vitelloni and it’s influence on him. However, until now, I didn’t know what he meant. \n\nI believe first and foremost is the similarity of both films beginnings. Both Fellini and Scorsese decides to introduce characters, or gang members, with a narrator. Although in I Vitelloni, you can’t help but confuse yourself while thinking who the narrator is. With Scorsese, this is clear from the beginning. Regardless, both of these introductions give us a quick insight of each characters and create a fast flowing story from the beginning. However, this is not the only inspiration of Scorsese. Further, when we get to know I Vitelloni characters more, I couldn’t help but compare Scorsese’s Henry Hill and Fellini’s Fausto. Funny thing is that their humor, actions and womanizer characteristics on the side, both actors look very similar too. It feels like Scorsese had a strong idea on his mind that he wanted to recreate Fellini’s Fausto in Goodfellas with more violent feelings and actions. However, I believe not only Fausto, but also Moraldo inspired Scorsese to create Henry Hill. Moraldo as being the youngest of the gang and his support for other gang members is also what I believe is a strong part of Henry Hill. \n\nIt is always great to see the inspiration of legendary directors and their decisions to use those inspirations to create something unique. So, I would love to hear from you if you also felt this way about both of the movies and your feeling towards I Vitelloni.",

        "text": "Training Day is an example where one actor's performance lifts a film to classic status. There is no doubt of course on Denzel Washington's superb performance. It was highly acclaimed and no surprise that he won an Oscar. There is hardly a beat in the performance where he misses.\n\nOften times great performances are supported by equally good writing and direction. Training Day has reasonably good writing and direction. But aside from the character of Alonzo, it feels ordinary. Luckily for them, Alonzo is there in almost every scene.\n\nWhere David Ayer (writer) &amp; Antoine Fuqua deserve credit is for injecting youthful energy into it. This was Ayer's 2nd film only and number 3 for Fuqua. You can tell that watching the film that the creative team consists of fresh talent. For one, it feels a bit 'unrefined' in places. Then, the addition of things like famous rappers, choice of music and dialogues just give off a youthful vibe.\n\nIn addition, Fuqua has to be praised for making a seemingly mundane story seem larger than life and adds an epic feel to it. Most of the heavylifting on this aspect is done by Washington. But as a director Fuqua succeeds too. A lot of the film is set inside tight, congested rooms or within cars or within a few neighbourhoods, yet it always feels like a larger scale film. Fuqua utilizes his space and sets really well and the actors as well as the script support him there.\n\nSpecial mention to Washington for a perfect performance and I think the base he was given was excellent too. Alonzo is a fantastic character with a lot of dark shades to him but he is always compelling to watch and listen to what he has to say.\n\nI think TD is a rightfully regarded classic \n\nWould you rank Training Day among the great crime dramas?",

I guess his earlier career as a photographer helped him out in this area.\n\nNow, his biggest strength might be his editing style. The average shot lengths for his movies tended to hover around the 12-second mark, which I'd argue is pretty much an ideal number as it's not so short so as to make the viewer confused about what's going on in a given scene, but not ridiculously long either (think of directors who do films with average shot lengths of 30+ seconds) where the viewer is bound to get at least sometimes get bored.\n\nWhat directors are some of your favorite ones based on these three characteristics of their visual styles?",

        "text": "What are your thoughts on Last Tango In Paris?\n\nLast Tango In Paris is a 1972 film directed by Bernardo Bertolucci and stars Marlon Brando and Maria Schneider with Brando portrays a recently widowed American who begins an anonymous sexual relationship with a young Parisian woman played by Schneider. \n\nThis film is Weird, but interesting. I think Marlon Brando gives his most personal performance as Paul.   As Paul, I sense vulnerability in Brando’s performance. It feels like he is baring part of his soul, without immediately realizing it and you get a sense a Tragedy and Grief.  Maria Schneider is also great in Last Tango In Paris and tries to hold her own with Brando.\n\nOne thing that intrigued me with Last Tango In Paris was the behind-the-scenes stuff and the controversial rape scene in which was not in the original script Bertolucci and Brando decided to improvises and did not tell Schneider until the day of filming. Schneider stated \" They only told me about it before we had to film the scene and I was so angry. I should have called my agent or had my lawyer come to the set because you can't force someone to do something that isn't in the script, but at the time, I didn't know that. Marlon said to me: 'Maria, don't worry, it's just a movie', but during the scene, even though what Marlon was doing wasn't real, I was crying real tears. I felt humiliated and to be honest, I felt a little raped, both by Marlon and by Bertolucci. After the scene, Marlon didn't console me or apologize. Thankfully, there was just one take.\"\n\nAlso, One Stories I heard is that While filming, Bernardo Bertolucci explained to Brando the point of the movies and that his character was his \"Manhood\" and that Maria Schneider's character was his \"dream girl.\" Brando later maintained that he had absolutely no idea of what Bertolucci was suggesting or even talking about\n\nThought by Accounts, Schneider and Brando made up and remained friends until Brando's death, but Schneider never made up with Bertolucci. Although one thing that intrigued me was that Both Schneider and Brando hated Bertolucci and refused to speak or work with Bertolucci again.\n\nBut I think The film is well shot, deeply engaging, really well written with depth full characters and a really interesting story. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on Last Tango in Paris?",

        "text": "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkeiEBaOOXA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkeiEBaOOXA)\n\nThe sequence I'm referring to starts at 1:14 in the video.\n\nRaimi starts with an extreme close-up of Spider-Man's eye. The camera zooms out and rotates, revealing to the viewer that Spider-Man is actually swung upside down. If Marc Webb or Jon Watts had shot this sequence, they probably would've zoomed out of Spidey's eye up until the point at which Spidey's head is visible (this alone would have already established that Spidey has a new suit), and then cut to a wider shot showing that Spidey is swung upside down. Raimi instead lets all of this play out in a single shot, which is a very good choice from the standpoint of audience immersion. Also notice how at 1:27 Raimi moves the camera itself down as Spidey jumps down instead of cutting to a new angle or doing a simple vertical pan. The entire shot lasts around 15 seconds, which is very rare for a major superhero blockbuster.\n\nThe cut to a close-up of Spidey's face at 1:30 is necessary not only because the viewer can get a better sense of how Peter Parker is reacting to the symbiote, but also to avoid a cut once Spidey jumps off the building and starts swinging at 1:51.\n\nThe entire minute-long sequence contains only six shots, so the average shot length is around 10 seconds. I cannot think of a single sequence in any superhero or comic book film with such slow cutting.\n\nAll in all this is some excellent directing from Raimi. There is nothing like this to be found in any of the MCU movies I've seen or Marc Webb's Amazing Spider-Man films.",

        "text": "The movie starts very well. It instantly got me interested, it was original.\n\nI liked that first part with the tension between the characters where, although both seem normal, you expect something to go wrong. I actually didn't think the guy would be a psycho, but I was thinking that she might be one (I don't mind that it didn't go in that direction).\n\nI was that guy, I'd tell her to go and figure out her own shit, at best let her sleep on the couch cause her attitude was annoying while the guy was going out of his way to accommodate her. But that's not relevant for the movie, just saying, she kind of annoyed me although I appreciate the realism.\n\nWhen they discovered the room and the hidden area, I was very intrigued. I don't mind that the plot ended there, the guy turned out to be normal and got killed, but as far as the payoff to the initial tension goes, I felt a bit cheated because the whole buildup was for nothing. I've seen many people say how genius the beginning was, but what's so genius if in the end none of it matters because the tension moves to a different place.\n\nThis kind of storytelling can be very cool, it reminds me of Psycho where you follow Marion Crane's plotline which is also essentially irrelevant once the real plot starts. However, whereas in Psycho Marion's buildup leads to an even better main story, The Barbarian's build up doesn't.\n\nI am not sure I liked the monster and the backstory. The backstory is cool in itself and she's definitely successfully disgusting and repulsive, but the logical inconsistencies annoy me.\n\nFor example - she's like 40. How did he possibly have the time to create so many generations of inbreeding that could produce her? Even if he impregnated his every descendant at the age of 13 or so, it doesn't add up. it would take many generations to lead to something like that.\n\nSecond, how would a product of inbreeding be so strong?\n\nWho kept her alive? She's been roaming around a ghetto for ages, someone would have shot her in the head already.\n\nAnd who is taking care of the father if she doesn't want to come near him and he can't do anything?\n\nWhere are all the other women or their remains?\n\nLogic aside and back to the story, I was again interested in the plot when the Justin Long part started. I think it's very original to have a protagonist who is a semi rapist.\n\nI wish we learned about what really happened in that situation. It could be a cool controversial element where it's not so clear cut, because it definitely doesn't seem he ever thought he raped that girl although it's also clear that in retrospect he thinks she might have a case against him. As is, it's hard to make much of it. At the end it's as if the movie wants us to accept him as a rapist although the case is kept vague.\n\nI like that he kind of decided he isn't such a good person and acted opportunistically to sacrifice the girl in order to kill the monster (although how the hell did the mom monster manage to buffer the girl's fall when she jumped after her?) But then his death is kind of abrupt and doesn't really produce an effect.\n\nI don't know how other viewers felt but it wasn't really satisfying to see him get killed because he was still the most entertaining character in the movie. Then the whole ending becomes pretty underwhelming.\n\nI guess another issue is that the truly evil guy is already old and dies, so it all comes to 3 characters of whom no one is really strong enough to continue carrying the tension.\n\nThe mother monster is grotesque but in the end she is manageable, she really just wants to pretend to be everyone's mom. It's still pretty fucked to have her drag you to the basement but she can be manipulated. She could work as a tragic character but she is too mentally retarded and too physically repulsive for the viewer to really want much for her aside from a mercy kill - could it be better if instead of a super strong inbread monster we deal with a girl who was once normal but became psychotic after years in the basement? Not sure.\n\nThe other is a guy who isn't a good person but he isn't really horrible either and is a bit of a comic relief. So he isn't really a threat, isn't fully a protagonist, has potential as a character but in the end not much is done with him.\n\nFinally the protagonist - she is shown as a good person and all but is just not interesting enough to carry the plot that lacks a strong villain.\n\nThe ending is just meh, nothing particularly interesting happens at this point, everything goes down predictably.\n\nOverall, it's hard to say what would make it better. I'm not even sure if the whole story with the mother monster works or not, of if it could be better with some changes. There are cool elements that don't end up leading to anything, like the setup at the beginning, Justin Long's rape case, and the story with the original guy who built the tunnels which is a cool story but packed with plot holes.\n\nFor me this is a 6.5, maybe 7. I would definitely watch another movie from that director though, there's something there.",

        "text": "This article includes a lot of film stills. If you would like to see the illustrated version click here. - [https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/frauke-finsterwalders-finsterworld/](https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/frauke-finsterwalders-finsterworld/)\n\n*Finsterworld* begins by setting up several seemingly unconnected storylines. Over time, they begin to overlap and eventually collide.\n\nEach story delves deeply into the emotional life of its characters. The stories are uncomfortably intimate. We encounter the various characters in both public and private spaces, where we see them move from unguarded and vulnerable to performative and social. The scenes have the tense discomfort of a **Todd Solondz** film, but without the humor.\n\nDirector Frauke Finsterwalder, unlike Solondz, underlines all of the emotional drama with a layer of moral and political struggle. *Finsterworld* could only have been made in Germany. There is an intense gravity at the core of the film that summons a brooding and tortured pall. A film like this requires a willingness to not only seek out the darker side of the human psyche, but an ability to stay in the darkness and steep in it. \n\nIt is not evident at first, but the film is haunted by the Holocaust. There are no swastikas or flashbacks of starving Jews in stripes, but it is all there under the surface. The film takes place in the present (2013), and although there are characters of various ages, all of whom were born after the war, the Holocaust is still lingering. The characters share a heavy cultural heritage that undermines and disorients them. They cannot understand the enormity of the past, and so have no starting point to ground them. \n\nThe film’s structure itself reflects their disoriented state. Finsterwalder deftly cuts from one arc to another, challenging us to keep up. It takes a while before we get the gist of the separate stories. Each time Finsterwalder switches, we have to reacclimate to a different set of characters and circumstances. These people are trying to find meaning by stringing together the events of their lives, and since we don’t have a lot of information, we end up joining them in their search. \n\nThe separate stories become jigsaw puzzles that slowly develop and then hint at the way they might fit into the larger overarching puzzle of the film. Finsterwalder carefully considers each piece and allows us to ponder more than one way for them to fit together. \n\nI am speaking in generalities so as not to ruin the film for potential viewers, but I will take a moment here to describe one scenario. There is a scene where a class of what appear to be high-school seniors visit a concentration camp with their history teacher. We get to know four students in particular, as well as the teacher. Two of the students are bullies. The very handsome blonde boy is a cold, sociopathic manipulator accompanied by his skinny, little toadie. The other two students are bookish and somewhat introverted, but the female of the two exchanges bitter banter with the bully.\n\nNone of them, including the teacher, know how to react to the camp. The teacher pleads with the students to face the shame and horror of their heritage, but he just seems melodramatic and the students pay no attention to him. The students wander around unsure of what it all means and what they are meant to be experiencing. The camp and its history are impossible to comprehend.\n\nWe follow the bookish teenage girl into a room that contains a line of ovens. It’s all cleaned up and blank, almost as if nothing happened. She goes over and opens an oven door. As soon as she leans in to look, the bully and his toadie appear from behind and shove her in. They lock the oven door and run off. It is a brutal scene that brings the Holocaust to life in a uniquely horrific way. We hear her screaming and kicking as she tries to get out, and then our minds begin to make the connections. This must have been what it sounded like. The camera just sits still while it films a visually still scene, but the muffled pounding at the iron door and panicked wailing are almost unbearable. Her being trapped in the oven is not only like what happened to the Jews, but it is also a representation of the German psyche trapped by a horror that will not allow it to move forward.  Later, when the history teacher finally walks into the room and hears sobbing coming from inside the oven, we can only imagine what is going through his head. Is it a ghost? A hallucinogenic echo from the past? Have the ovens absorbed so much pain and sorrow that now they weep? \n\nThe beautiful blonde bully becomes an image of Aryan terror, enjoying his ability to manipulate those around him. He will go on to commit other atrocities later in the film. As the different stories collide, everything gets worse. The film slowly darkens, inexorably sinking into dreadful despair.\n\nTheodor Adorno famously said that “poetry is impossible after Auschwitz.” It seems that Finsterwalder has substituted the word “poetry” for “meaning.” There is a whole generation of postwar German artists who had to contend with this inheritance. Werner Herzog made films like ***Aguirre, The Wrath of God*** to explore how power operates. Anselm Kiefer made gigantic paintings of burned and baron landscapes to address the nation's loss of innocence and hope.\n\nAs an artist, Finsterwalder uses an avatar to place herself in the film. She is represented by a young documentary filmmaker. Finsterwalder had been a documentarian up until making *Finsterworld*. In *Finsterworld*, her character can’t seem to find a meaningful subject matter. The people she interviews are numb and disconnected. She is looking for something beautiful and cannot find it. In the meantime, her marriage is falling apart. Neither she nor her husband understands who they are or what they want. Her husband has found some amount of solace in the furry community, but when he reveals it to his wife, she is disgusted.\n\n*Finsterworld* is about rudderless people struggling to find meaning in their lives. A meaning that will show them a way forward. However, it seems that their country’s past has undermined the foundations they are trying to build on. It is not that their past is holding them back, it is that there is no stable place to lay the cement. Their shared past is too monstrous to comprehend, and so leaves them disoriented. To chart a trajectory, you need a starting point, and they can’t seem to find one.",

Basically the creators themselves have become \"otaku\".\n\nWish fulfillment or controversial content isn't particularly new in anime but I can confidently say things have gotten worse. Especially since, \"otaku\" became a bigger source of revenue the wish fulfillment anime have become increasingly sickening.\n\nThere's a lot of mainstream anime that pander to pedophile fantasies(Mushoku Tensei, Monogatari), slave grooming fantasies(Shield hero), Edgy genocide fantasies(Attack on Titan) and rape fantasies (Redo of healer).\n\nWhile in Hollywood wish fulfillment has not degraded to such levels but you can already see nerd obsessions having negative effects. So far it's restricted to memberberries(The Force Awakens, No Way Home) and pop culture references(Free guy and Ready Player One). Ready Player One especially the source material especially the source material is the worst kind of neckbeard pandering I've seen from USA. Although; Spielberg did try to turn chicken shit to Chicken Salad here, so I don't blame him.\n\nAnyway, whatever you can say about films like Top Gun Maverick or Gladiator, I'd rather films pander to the sensibilities of the general audience than nerd when it comes to popcorn entertainment/wish fulfillment.",

The acting was good but I didn’t find DD Lewis’s performance groundbreaking. \n\nFor me the story was bland. No characters who you actual care about. Little character development - to me, Plainview was evil from the beginning and never changed. There were no memorable scenes worth rewatching the film for. Even the ending felt over dramatic, random and anticlimactic. The music was interesting but felt out of place at times. \n\nFor such a long run time, it felt like so little happened and such a generic message was conveyed. \n\nCan someone explain all the praise this film gets?",

        "text": "This entire year, you’ve probably heard all kinds of praises for the long-awaited Top Gun sequel. When it came out in theaters, we were all amazed at the big-screen spectacle and movie-star bravado of Tom Cruise and the supporting cast, and how the film felt like a well-updated continuation of the first movie. But now that it's out on Blu-Ray, I've gotten a chance to see it on my own, and I was surprised by how much it **improved** on the re-watch.  The action and aerial shots still looked really good on my TV screen, with so many images that can be used as a desktop background. Yet even when removing the action scenes, the interpersonal drama remained intriguing between Maverick and the other characters, with everyone being memorable and fleshed out, and the script was top-notch with great writing and character development and no plot holes. I could just see a masterpiece unfolding before my very eyes.\n\n*Top Gun: Maverick* feels like the first tentpole movie to come out in years that was made by and for adults. If you removed all the flying and action scenes, this would fit as a prestige drama you'd see on HBO or as an Oscar movie. The characters all have real conversations with one another about their motivations, and the emotions feel genuine. Everyone treats their situation with complete seriousness, instead of winking at the camera or saying a funny line. There’s no embarrassingly bad lines of dialogue that try to come across as witty or deeply profound, yet are actually stupid once you say them out loud in the real world. Even though the film takes place in the present day in our world, it truly feels timeless, with no modern-day pop-culture references or shoehorned progressive political messages; it's just a simple story about a lone wolf who serves in the U.S. military and plays by his own rules in order to bomb an unnamed foreign enemy. On top of that, there are no wonky VFX shots or out-of-focus frames that can be taken out of context by being posted on Twitter with the phrase \"This is an actual shot from a $170M movie! Who the hell green-lit this, and why do blockbusters look so much worse now than they did in the 2000's?!!?\" Best of all, this is the rare blockbuster that has a coherent plot with a beginning, middle, and end, without ever needing to tease future sequels or spinoffs, and the characters all act rationally and are likable. So many modern movies have forgotten how to do this, so it's great to see one that goes back to the basics.\n\nWhat truly makes the movie click again is Maverick's overall role. He simultaneously gets to be the main hero and the wise old mentor to a new generation. There might be a diverse supporting cast, young and old alike, but they all know their place and eventually learn to look up to Pete Mitchell. The characters all fit archetypes perfectly without the need to subvert expectations, and they have just the right level of complexity and depth needed to support Maverick's mission. And he’s able to destroy the enemy with Goose’s kid and have the whole team help him and get the girl at the end. Tom Cruise might genuinely be a psychopath, but he's still got that movie-star swagger, and I buy him as an action hero way more than someone like Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds, Chris Pratt, or Gal Gadot.\n\nTGM's improvement on home video is even more impressive when you consider all the other big-budget blockbusters that have come out since 2015 and made a lot of money, and were generally given a pass by critics and audiences while they played in theaters. The biggest examples are the Star Wars sequel trilogy, some of DC's recent critical successes, Disney/Pixar's recent animated output (including some of their live-action re-imaginings), and especially most of the MCU since Phase 3 (like Black Panther, Captain Marvel, No Way Home, and Infinity War/Endgame). They usually boasted having a diverse cast who all had cool crowd-pleasing moments, and they kept true to the spirit of the classic characters who didn't do anything jarringly stupid, and their plots were considered coherent and logical. Those movies all got good critic and audience scores for instantly appealing to the zeitgeist and telling stories that \"captured the cultural moment\" well, and came out in a time when people genuinely believed more blockbusters should be considered for awards, so they broke so many box-office records that the studios managed to pat themselves on the back and keep green-lighting more movies like these just to get the positive press.\n\nYet by the time these movies hit home video, their flaws were made more apparent and they were seen as the cynical cash-grabs that they are. Specifically, they re-used the same plot as previous movies, relied on cheap nostalgia and callbacks, undid the previous movie's ending, had a generic 3rd-act CGI battle, and pandered to audiences with obvious fan service. In general, all those movies were revealed to simultaneously re-hash their predecessors' plots and deviate so far from the originals that they're no longer recognizable. Even more prevalent, many of the films had young hot leads who suddenly got powers for no reason and could save the day with ease while replacing the original stars, and more often than not were women or POC, so if you criticized the movies for bad characterization and writing, you got called bigoted and dumb. The studios forgot that audiences don’t hate movies because they’re more diverse, we hate movies because they’re poorly written. Good thing we're moving further away from that era of blockbuster filmmaking, but we all still need to remain vigilant whenever a studio announces a tentpole movie and mentions having a woman or minority in a prominent role, so we're certain they don't lose track of a good story.\n\nI'm glad that *Top Gun: Maverick* was able to become one of the highest-grossing films of all time, as a true testament to how great a blockbuster can still be. A lot of people have been talking about what its success means for the future of film. Some people are hoping this means that more movies will shoot with more practical effects and real stunts, but I'm not going to say that. What I **do** hope is for studios to stop green-lighting all these modern VFX-heavy blockbusters that use representation as a substitute for a good script, and go back to good, old-fashioned, timeless storytelling.",

So I was curious and checked out his review and it seems he actually did understand it and had to say this about?\n\n&gt; **Of course, \"Fight Club\" itself does not advocate Durden's philosophy. It is a warning against it**, I guess; one critic I like says it makes \"a telling point about the bestial nature of man and what can happen when the numbing effects of day-to-day drudgery cause people to go a little crazy.\" I think it's the numbing effects of movies like this that cause people go to a little crazy. **Although sophisticates will be able to rationalize the movie as an argument against the behavior it shows, my guess is that audience will like the behavior but not the argument**. Certainly they'll buy tickets because they can see Pitt and Norton pounding on each other; a lot more people will leave this movie and get in fights than will leave it discussing Tyler Durden's moral philosophy. **The images in movies like this argue for themselves, and it takes a lot of narration (or Narration) to argue against them.**\n\n\nWhich actually brings me to my main  point.  We expect films to work at an emotional level and according to Ebert Tyler's philosophy will probably resonate with the audience more than the argument the film makes about Tyler's behavior towards the end. At this point, can we really blame the audience for not taking away its intended message? Do you think Fincher might've failed at making the counter argument feel impactful? Same with wolf of wallstreet. The most enduring piece of dialogue and imagery from that movie seems to be \"There's no nobility in poverty\", and it resonates with people. Do you think scorcese should’ve done more to create more resonant dialogue and imagery that supported the counter argument?",

However, once you start understanding Stuart's character more and more, you can't take your eyes off the screen. Tom Hardy, as usual, gave a powerful performance which Benedict did immensely well to complement with his composed acting. However, the latter won the screen in the very last scene which was pure, raw emotion at its best. \n\nThe film is heart-warming and soul-crushing at the same time. The fact that it is a true story makes it even more tragic.  \n\nIf you ever wonder how these two went on to take the world by storm, this film is an early example of their prowess!
