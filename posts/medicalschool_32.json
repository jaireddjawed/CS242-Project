(semester before that i had one module in pathology which i failed too.. and this post is about that actually)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nnow this semester.. i had to redo one module, and two others that were blocked before.. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAND I FUCKING FAILED this one AGAIN.. (its general pathology principles)\n\nhonestly dont know what to even say about this. im beyond defeated.. i actually studied.. and was sleep deprived.. and the worst part is.. i thought i was passing the whole time.. but the score was more than underwhelming\n\nwhen i was comparing my knowledge to others it made me so confident cuz i thougth i knew the majority of the stuff FOR SURE.. even as it started.. everything was going so well.. till the end..\n\nbut i still failed.. this is the first time im failing something THE SECOND TIME..\n\n(dunno how it is anywhere else.. but if you fail somethin three times here youre out the program)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nnow i dont even know how to feel about anything.. the way it is.. i think it might add an extra year again.. and it makes me feel so shit about everything..\n\nalso.. i have upcoming exams.. for two other modules.. ones days from now.. and another one next week.. (in my uni you get two tries... you fail once, you can redo it at the end of the semester... if you fail again you redo the module next year.. and i basically have all those exams stacked up now at the end of the sem.. not just me tho.) so i just feel exccrutiating pressure.. and me failing this shit again didnt help at all..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhow will all of these effects my future?? for residencies and etc..",

        "text": "Hello everyone. I won’t go into detail, but I’ll just say that via a few special circumstances I am in a PharmD program extremely early and will have a PharmD at the same age as all my peers will have undergrad degrees. I love pharmacy but I’m also not blind—I can see how atrocious the job market is, and how much of a scam residency is for pharmacists in terms of time invested to pay increase (spoiler alert it’s a few years of half salary for more responsibilities and no pay increase), so I’ve come to a bit of a dilemma: I want to be a serious clinician—and good pharmacists absolutely are—but I also want to be reimbursed for my skills. So I’m pretty seriously considering using my massive time advantage and academic momentum to just go into MD school right after. I’ll have rotational experience that my peers will have yet to cut their teeth on, I’ll have much more pharmacology knowledge, I’ll just need to put in the work. I was thinking anesthesiology, as my advanced pharmacology knowledge will come in very handy, and dosing knowledge and dispensing are already pharmacist specialties.\n\nWhat do you guys think? A pharmacist salary is nothing to scoff at in the grand scheme of things—my opportunity cost overall is around a million dollars (I graphed it all out), but at the end of the day the years are going to pass regardless—it’s just where I end up at the end of them. And hey with how easy first year should be considering the material overlap I could do some PRN work and pull in  40-50k to put towards loans. Thoughts?\n\nAlso I have no idea what flair to put so we’ll go with well being.",

Pleas have the patience to read this post and help me, thanks in advance. \n\nI'm a 4th year med student in Italy and I'd like to have a traineeship in another EU within the Erasmus Traineeship programme. I \"need\" to spend 5 weeks in internal medicine, 3 weeks general surgery, 1 week intensive care, 2 weeks in emergency room and 2 weeks where I want. Why I wrote \"need\"? I could stay in Italy but I just need to have an experience like this in another country, it's a unique occasion for me. I'm not talking only about the hospital related experience. \n\nI'm looking for an English-friendly country. I won't learn a local language, maybe just some basics for everyday things like groceries, asking for directions or other less-important things. \n\nCountries that aren't eligible: UK (for now everything is stuck because of Brexit), other countries non-EU (don't tell me Australia or New Zealand or whatever), no USA, no other continents, so you get it. Only EU countries are accepted. \n\nSo I don't know where to start, for now I'm just checking Google Maps like a little dummie and that's it hahahah.\nFor now I'm thinking about Ireland but I'd like to evaluate warmer countries. \n\nStill my plan is to write a nice email, where I explain what the Erasmus Traineeship programme consists of, what I'd like to do, which departments I'd like to go and see what they answer me. What do you think? Looking for advice, thanks homies. I hope my English is understandable, I'm still learning and I promise that in 2024 I'll be an English speaking beast hahah",

Keep getting rejected\n\nI had friends outside of med school but they live an hr away and recently stopped inviting me to stuff too. I got to watch their Galentines Day party via social media.\n\nFeeling overall very rejected and lonely. I keep taking rejections personally even though they likely are not. I feel like I'm doing something wrong but idk what it is :/\n\n Note: ppl have said they think I'm on the autism spectrum in the past or just socially awkward idk",

I’m sure I’ll be asked about this. i thought of simply saying that I was still adjusting to med school and I wasn’t good with managing my time and that I overcame that issue later on.\n\nIn reality I was severely depressed, suicidal, unmotivated and at the same time I was taking care of a sick family member that was on the verge of death. One of my colleagues told me it’s better to keep this to myself because the PD might conclude that I’m emotionally unstable and that I can’t work optimally under stress so he might simply reject me. \n\n\n\nGPA’s are really important where im from and I heard that the program I’m interested in cares A LOT about GPAs.",

I've done all of my rotations and am just waiting to start back up in July, so I pushed back Step 2 and am studying for that right now. I'm trying to decide what to do with the rest of my time. I have one published paper, but it's in really basic science stuff, and I was the vice president of the global health interest group during my second year. Other than that, my resume is severely lacking. I'm trying to get some volunteering in at the free clinic right now, but what would y'all recommend I do with the rest of my time? So far I could do some more relevant research or I could work as a medical assistant at this dermatologist office I used to work at. Could use the money tbh and would prefer to do that if it would look good on a resume! Thanks for reading! Appreciate the advice in advance",
