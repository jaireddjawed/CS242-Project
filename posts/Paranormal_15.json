        "text": "The house I grew up in when I was younger had previously been seized back off the tenants due to a serious crime. According to our neighbours the person had locked their daughter in the attic and abused her severely resulting in her death. When we moved in there was a clause added to the tenancy agreement to say that the attic had been sealed shut and no access was allowed. To make things worse, it was frosted stained glass that was deep red and green that was in the hatches place, which of course just happened to be on the landing outside of my room.\n\n​\n\nAnyway, when I was 14, I was in my room which for clarity I will attempt an ASCII layout of the room:\n\n\\_      \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n    / desk    | \n\n /   me        |\n\n| (((BED))) |\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\\_ = wall / = door\n\nPlease excuse the poor drawing.\n\n​\n\nIt was 3-4am, I was off school on holiday so was sat on my computer. The house itself was a small terraced house, I lived with my mum, sister and brother. Everyone was asleep and due to the type of house it was, if anyone moves about on the landing you could hear the floor boards creak. I thought I had heard a noise so I turned my music down slightly to listen, didn't hear anything so I carried on as I was. My door was open slightly as I drew on the shitty picture. Then all of a sudden I heard this huge bang from the door, as if someone had thrown a chair at it, but the door didn't move at all. I was absolutely petrified.\n\n​\n\nI eventually built up the courage to see if it was anyone fucking with me, but when I checked everyone was asleep and snoring away. As I came back to my room I noticed there was 3 lines in the door where the paint had come off, the same width of a finger and spanning about a third across the door. Safe to say I got in my bed and used the demon proof bed covers we all have!\n\n​\n\nI then shortly after moved into my Dads house (unconnected as to why) and about 6 months later there was a meteor shower. I lived with my dad and Auntie (who was in her late 70s) and we was on the patio looking for the meteor shower, but my Auntie got spooked for some reason and started rushing back inside. She said it wasn't right and there was evil about. She told us to go inside, shut all the doors and windows in the house and close the curtains. Me and my Dad passed it off as her just being an old superstitious woman and didn't think much of it.\n​\n\nThat night, I was in bed and realised I'd forgotten to shut my wardrobe doors. Are you ready for another shitty ASCII drawing to paint a picture?\n\n​\n\n\\_\\_ . . . . . . . . . .\\_\n\n|Bed              &lt;\n\n|                      |\n\n|...\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ |\n\n... = door\n\n. . . . . . . . . = window\n\n&lt; = wardrobe\n\n​\n\nSo now we're past the shit drawing, back to what happened. I fell asleep, and I still remember the dream I had vividly. I was approaching a manor house where my girlfriend at the time had run into. As I came in there was a hallway going to the right with a big mirror against the far wall. My girlfriend ran to the corridor and looked along it, which I couldn't see down at the time. She then froze and started screaming hysterically. I ran over and asked her what was wrong and she was just looking through me. I turned around to look down this corridor and at the end of it was some double doors slightly open, there was about a meter gap where they was open and in this gap was a dark figure, it had no distinguishable features but it's eyes. They were yellow with red pupils. It was almost levitating and the edges of all its limbs were blurred and it was floating up and down within the doorway silently. As I made eye contact with it, I froze. I couldn't speak or move. Then I started walking towards it, I had 0 control until I was about an inch away from its face. I could feel it panting on me until it unleashed this horrific scream and slammed the doors shut. I woke up instantly, my wardrobe doors were shut and I had scratches on each side of my ribs. The next day I checked the wardrobe doors (which has been open in the same position as the doors in the dream, before slamming shut) and this time there was 3 lines on each door, similar proportions to the previous incident but this time they were charred, like the varnish had been burned.\n\n\n\nAfter that last incident I moved out of the house about 2 weeks later. I couldn't handle it but that was 10 years ago and I have only had one incident happen since. Could of been sleep paralysis the second time but the doors shutting, the scratches and the burns I'm not sure how to explain.",

The lane I was walking in is usually quiet, maybe a couple of people walking their dogs or a car or two. It’s close to a park so it’s not as isolated as you’d think.\n\nNow I see this man, walking about 50 meters away from me. Old, tall, skinny. He’s wearing a tucked in formal shirt, belt and trousers. He’s walking in my direction when I walk over a speed bump. I look down for hardly a fraction of a second and look back up and he’s gone. I was confused so I run up to where he was to see if he went into one of the buildings or got into a vehicle parked at the side of the street. Seems to have disappeared into thin air. I’m very confused. Can anyone debunk this? Or has anyone experienced something similar? What could he have been?",

        "text": "To give a little background information so this story makes more sense, I live in a small Midwestern town of around 500 people. I am in my early 20s and I work in an adjacent town about 10-15 minutes away. A good friend of mine passed away unexpectedly a week ago. We will call him L. He was loved and respected by the entire community. Each morning on my drive to work, I pass by his girlfriend's house. \n\nToday, I was driving my normal route to and I can't help but feel like he paid me a visit as I passed by her house. Like he was there watching over her and thought, \"now is my chance to f*ck with him.\" L was known to do things like this when he was alive, so why couldn't he do things like this in the afterlife? 🤷‍♂️\n\nOn my key chain, I have a key locator. Its basically a tiny speaker that beeps when you the button on a remote. As I was driving past her house, I glanced over at the place and all of the sudden, the beeper started going off.  Instantly, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. It scared the sh*t out of me for a second. I can almost hear him laughing at me as I type this... As I continued to drive, the startled feeling quickly faded away and I was filled with a feeling of relief and closure. Something tells me that he is ok. Almost like he did this to let me know. I haven't  slept the past few nights thinking about him, but I now feel a little better. Sure, it could have just been a coincidence. A stray signal from something in the car may have set it off. But I just have a feeling that L was watching over his girl and decided to take the opportunity to let me know that wherever he is, he is ok.",

It's a picture kind of like a Bob Ross painting of nature if you've ever saw them. I was playing Xbox with my friends at about 12 am earlier and it fell off the wall. After 14 years of being there it fell. It unplugged my TV and everything\n\nI remember having a vivid dream a while back about the wall it was hanging on. So the picture is a big rectangle right? Well in the dream the picture wasn't there. A window into the other living room was there and it was the same size as the picture. I'm not sure who it was in the dream but it was of a woman dressed in 1950s clothes kind of like a maid outfit from the 50s and a beehive hairstyle. If you've ever saw Orange is the new Black, she looked similar to Mr. Healy's mom. She was talking to me through the window and that's all I remember about that dream. I don't think this is a coincidence and I'm kinda scared not gonna lie",

        "text": "Some context. I live in a house built on (what used to be) farmland in 1862. The first family to live there was a farm family of 9 people. It has been confirmed that a 1 year old has died in our house, of what I believe to be illness, although I cannot remember as my mom found this info during a free trial of Ancestry years ago. Although the last 2 families to live here, along with one of the old neighbors claims there is a woman in our home, believed to be one of the older daughters in the family. \n\nWe started noticing paranormal signs quickly, but everyone seems to have different experiences. My mom and sister have both claimed to see a girl running around in the house. My mom and stepdad claim to hear banging around upstairs when they’re the only ones home. This cannot be explained by a squatter, as our “attic” isn’t even big enough for my 9 year old sister to get into, there’s probably like 3 hiding places total in this little house, and we have a chihuahua who won’t let anyone in unnoticed. Tried to sneak an ex bf in once as a teen and hide him in a closet, my dog immediately ran upstairs and barked/clawed at the closet, and i was immediately busted.\n\nThe activity seems to come and go in waves. But lately (when I say lately, I mean within the past year), I’ve noticed it amp up a bit. On way more occasions than I can even keep track of anymore, I’ll set an item down, go to do something, and when I come back for it, it’s gone. So i tear apart the whole room, only to find the item back in the spot I knew i left it in. I have ADHD, so the first few times I chalked it up to me being forgetful. But after so many times in the course of like a week, I knew that the first time I’d check the spots I left these items in, they wouldn’t be there. And this will happen to me over and over for a week or two, then out of the blue, it’ll stop for a few months, and my items will always be where i left them. Then after those few months, everything starts disappearing again. I know i’m not just going crazy every few months.\n\nDoes anyone else have similar experiences? What is this game they’re playing? I try not to get angry as that’s known to provoke negative energy and i don’t wanna mess with forces i can’t see, but it does get annoying when i’m trying to get ready for work and everything i set down goes missing. \n\nI’ve had other experiences too such as lamps that aren’t plugged in suddenly turning on, shadows running/dancing in my peripheral vision, the volume on my tv going all the way up when the remote isn’t even near me and the volume dial on the tv never changed (this happened only twice). but this seems to be the one thing that happens constantly and no one else in the house experiences this specific thing.",

        "text": "So here it goes…I’d say I have been sitting on this “story” (and I do mean to put it in quotes as it is an ongoing phenomena) for almost 5 years now. I don’t know how to even begin as this is coming from a place of hope and bewilderment. I do want to say that this story is 100% true and will happily answer any questions at all regarding anything to the best of my ability. \n\nAs far back as I can recall, I’ve always had this draw to the paranormal realm. Especially as a kid I can remember nights where I’d do the whole crawl into bed with mom and dad because I heard something or felt something. It got so bad that we had to have our pastor friend come and bless the house. It stopped after awhile and I carried on to live without anything peculiar happening for a long time. \n\nLeaning more towards the present, I can say that these past five or so years have been the most paranormal and out of this world times of my life. To put it bluntly, I became possessed by an entity or multiple entities that eventually came out of my body and I now have the ability to let them come and go as I please. Have I lost you? I know, right??? Insane. We live on Earth, not this magical world where the impossible is only seen in fiction or passed down tales. You have questions and I’m sorry if that came like a fastball to the head right off the bat, but I do have answers. \n\nI left college during my third year to see if I could find something or somewhere else to explore (I wanted to get into improv comedy as I was studying theater). I came home and that’s where it started to occur. One after another, you name it and I’ve probably been through it. Black cats, orbs, feeling cold, hearing voices, I’ve been through the ringer and some. Keep in my mind, I have never had any mental issues throughout my life. I lived a simple life in a cul de sac with a loving family of two brothers, a mom, and a dad. Tell me why then, at 21, was I admitted to a mental facility for “psychosis”. \n\nFor those of you who wish to know specifics, I can give you stories to take up a few evenings where at the end you might not want to invite me back over. I mean, honestly, has this happened to anyone else? How do you tell someone about this? The only research I’ve ever done led me to people like Anneliese Michel or the boy who “The Exorcist” was supposed to be based on. Nothing in a textbook, nothing on WebMD, no sources except paranormal “experts” who I’ve tried to contact to no avail. You keep telling yourself it’s all in your head but I can still feel them here. Not joking, literally inside me. They come out through the mouth and come in right down Main Street (the rear). \n\nI didn’t want to make this post crazy long but I do have more to tell for those who want to hear. I do again want to reiterate that this is a 100% true story and that for the last five years it’s been nagging at me as to what I should do. I, first and foremost, am a good person, I know that. I’ve helped people who’ve experienced paranormal entities and wish to do that more. \n\nThank you so much for reading! Again I can answer any questions, much love.\n\nTL;DR - I became a vessel for entities at 21 (am now 25)",

I also predicted my brothers diagnosis with diabetes. I had dreamt it one night and when I woke up had forgotten about it until a few days later when my mom told me of it. When I told my mom of my dream she went pale and told me this isn’t the first time she saw me do this.

Disclaimer no one ever used it or showed me how it worked, I just knew. I had also predicted the death of my great grandmother when I was little, she was dying of cancer and I asked my dad if she was gonna die, he said no of course, three days later she passed away… does anyone else experience this?

As I’m reaching for the lid to the top loader , I hear a very loud and menacing “HEY” I jump out of my skin, rip my air pods out &amp; turn around to see a very tall , heavy man in a black coat pointing directly at me. I seen him for not even a second… he evaporated.  He sounded angry &amp; the energy in the room was suffocating\n\nI felt my heart beating in my ears, wanting to run out of there but I didn’t wanna leave my clothes behind . I called my wife &amp; told her everything , shaking within my tone . \n\nNeedless to say I folded my clothes VERY QUICKLY. I don’t think I’ll be going back there by myself anytime soon",

I moved into my brothers old room in the basement and renovated it so I can move into the room, but he had always told me that it’s haunted and he always heard knocking at his door really late at night with noone around. I never heard knocking, although weird stuff has been happening recently. For context; i have hooks that I hang my skateboards on and they are rated for 15 pounds or such and they hold my decks nicely, I put a cross on one behind my bed (normal size cross barely weighs anything) and so the first  thing that happened was that woke up one morning and my cross was lying next to my face in my bed. There’s no way someone would have moved it from the wall without me waking up because they would have to get on my bed to reach it, keep in mind it is to my left on the wall and was on my right next to my head when i woke up. So I put it back on the hook and it was holding fine but a couple days later at exactly 3am it flew off the hook and fell onto my bed. I walked up to it to check if the hook was wiggly but it wasn’t at all. I left the cross laying flat on my headboard shelf and nothing happened since. Any input?",

One day I was home alone for the weekend and I heard foot steps by the stairs (ok weird right but I just blamed it on the cats). Next I was sitting on the couch the same night and I feel a hand grab my ankle slightly. Ok now that creeped my out and I ran. Then the next day I go upstairs to my room (it’s right above the one he died in) and there is a coat tag on the bed with his name on it from a really long time ago. Now I was not looking at boxes or doing anything on my bed that can cause this to be there. my room was spotless. This happened about 3 years ago maybe even more but I just remembered it after reading a post and wanted to know everyone’s thoughts on this. Nothing else weird has happened other than me just thinking someone is behind me constantly but that’s probably just me.",

We looked over the rail and saw this kid crouched on a big flat stone at the edge of the creek poking around in the water with a stick. He was wearing a red hoodie with the hood up, blue jeans and white high top sneakers. I couldn’t help but notice how incredibly clean his clothes and shoes looked. Well we thought it would be funny to drop a rock in the water and splash him seeing that didn’t seem to know we were there. Then he just looked up at us. Didn’t stand up or anything, just calmly turned his head and looked right at us. His face was pure white and perfectly smooth like an egg or something. No features at all. The fear we felt at his gaze was instant and intense. We ran like hell for about two blocks and after that day we never talked about it again. \n About a year later I was hanging out with some other guys riding bikes and another friend came running up out of breath and freaked out. Started describing the exact same faceless kid doing the same exact thing but at a different spot along the river. I just kind of froze over but everyone else was just making fun of him. I looked at him and just asked “Super clean looking “? He just went silent. I wonder if anyone else has seen this thing.",

Wondering if anyone else has had similar experience?\n\nIt was our last night at the Tapa Tower located within Hilton Waikiki Village and I went to the bathroom while my husband and toddler were outside. Husband was sitting at the desk eating dinner and my boy was on the tablet watching something. There was a large mirror on the wall where the desk is and my husband said while he was eating, he saw who he thought was me walking across the room through the mirror. He was about to ask if I had forgotten something before going to the bathroom but my son asked him for some milk so he didn’t. By the time he turned around, the figure was gone. He then realized that the bathroom door never opened and I was still in the bathroom the whole time. Also I was wearing a red t shirt and blue pajama shorts while the person he saw in the mirror was wearing a blue shirt sleeve with some floral pattern and khaki shorts. He said she looked like me with the hair tied except she was wearing glasses. I wasn’t wearing my glasses at the time.\n\nI tried to ask if it was something he thought he saw at the corner of his eye or maybe just for a second but he said it was a solid person and he actually looked straight in the mirror at it thinking it was me until he realized it wasn’t but when he turned around it wasn’t there. There was no see-through like Casper or bright lights and the figure didn’t saw anything. I didn’t see or hear anything while I was in the bathroom but definitely couldn’t sleep all night! Will not be going back to that hotel room!",

Usually I go to bed fairly late last night I went to bed around 2am every night when I go to bed my cat will lay with me. I’d like to add that since I just moved into this apartment I have a few boxes that haven’t been unpacked yet. Well last night I was having a weird dream about a guy getting interviewed on the news (this is weird because whenever I dream it’s usually about myself) at some point he’s talking about a missing person and before he says the name. I hear what sounds like a ton of glass falling from a certain area of the room. It wakes me and I just feel my whole body bolt upright and I’m just staring at the corner of my room where I had heard the noise. I just feel this wave of anxiety fill my body I don’t know what fell. I’m honestly just sitting there no trying to think of what could have fallen but I know there’s no glass in that box. This whole time my cat it also staring at that same corner of the room too. I decided to put my glasses on and I grabbed my phone to use the flashlight i looked at the time too it was 6am now. I went to check the box and as I thought no glass everything was exactly how I packed it I decided to look at the other boxes around my room just in case it wasn’t that boxes that fell so I looked around and everything was how I left it when I went to bed. I laid back down after and my cat jumped out of bed and walked around for a few seconds then he immediately jumps back onto my bed and gets extremely close to me while staring at that specific corner of the room. Then he stops and lays down and goes back to sleep. I’m still awake though and just as I’m about to go back to sleep I hear dripping water it sounds like it’s fitting the carpet and it sounds like a ton of it and then I just hear the carpet squishing like the sound of feet walking. I can feel myself getting tighter and tighter like I’m about to die of panic and then it just stops like nothing I grabbed my phone and glasses and checked where I heard it but the floor was dry when I turn back around my cat is awake and staring at that snake corner his eyes looked different but I knew it was my cat but his eyes they looked like something else like he was scared. I went back to bed and I tried to go back to sleep but couldn’t I don’t like sleeping with the lights on but this time I couldn’t fall asleep without them I opened my blinds it was still so dark out but it was just bright enough for me to go back to sleep. I’m at work now and it’s still raw on my mind I feel like a monster leaving my cat there alone. Nothing like this has every happened to me before.",

        "text": "I have another post on this sub and not sure these two things are related but its big enough to be its own post anyway. I remembered I have a stuffed angel doll that others in my life have had weird experiences with but not me and that I think is doing what its supposed to be and keeping me safe from whatever is in my house but want to know if this sounds the same to anyone else or if Im crazy...\n\nWhen i was about 3 or 4 my grandfather on my mothers side gave me a doll. Its a stuffed angel with a stitched on halo, pretty old and not really on store shelves but Ive seen a bunch on ebay sell for pretty low.  Anyway, if you press on its stomach it says a prayer and even today I can press on its stomach and theres no sound distortion or anything (Im 21). It'll start saying a prayer in spanish that's a shortened version of \"ángel de mi guarda\" which translates to \"my guardian angel\". The clothes are sewn on by the arms so I cant take them off completely and theres no opening on the body from what I can tell. That being said theres no way to access the box inside to change batteries, it's had the same batteries for about 18 years and works perfectly.\n\nIve done okay taking care of it, a bit dirty and a cousin of mine ripped its halo off but it was only held in by like 4 threads so everything else is fine. During my childhood it was kept in a wooden toy box at my grandmothers house and never taken out cause my family always thought it was creepy and said they would hear it praying even though nobody touched it and it was still in the box.\n\nAt my grandmother's some of my aunts and uncles said they'd be in their rooms doing whatever then would hear it start praying from my grandma's room where my box was. My grandmother said she had woken up because she heard it but once she fully woke up it wasnt even on.\n\nI lived with my father in the neighboring town at the time and there were times where nobody but him was home because me and my siblings were at school and my stepmother was at work. He was alone one day and as he was leaving for work he heard the toy start praying but couldnt find it. He looked in every room, checked in boxes, looked under and behind furniture and couldnt really figure out where the sound was coming from so he couldnt find the doll. He was late but felt like it was driving him nuts so he kept looking and eventually had to give up and leave. The reason he couldnt find it was because it wasnt even in the house, it was still at my grandma's in the box.\n\nSkipping forward a few years (i was maybe 12 or 13), my family moved and I got my doll from my box. I was always very careful with my things so I would basically have it on display somewhere instead of thrown around or tucked away and never had anything strange happen, then I gave it to a gf of mine during my freshman year of highschool as a good luck type gift and she also never mentioned anything strange happening but got creeped out after I told her other people would hear it pray at night.\n\nMy family moved again that summer and the house we moved into was already creepy. There was a weird painting of a lady hanging up (the painting not the lady) in our basement that my grandpa on my dads side wanted to keep but we all agreed to throw it out before he noticed. Then on several occasions my father would message me at night saying to stop walking around so loudly even though I had already been laying in bed for hours and didnt hear any walking myself. This along with with all the doors on the first floor opening whenever they wanted equalled overall creepy vibes. A couple months later I started having horrible nightmares for a week or two straight. Every night was horrible and they all took place in the attic where I stay, how its set up is a staircase near the back of the house which lead into an open room that took up half the attic then a short hallway then my room that took up the rest of the attic. Sometimes in the nightmares Id try to walk through the other room to reach the stairs but the door would be locked or I would be too scared of whatever I saw over there that I couldn't even push myself to leave my room or something would stop me from trying to leave. Other times Id try looking out the window for an exit and it would be completely empty outside, like a void. Or there would be someone standing in the street or a block away just looking up at me and watching me which made me scared to even try to leave cause I felt it would come after me. I was trapped and would have things show up in the room to just scare the crap out of me and once I woke up I was in my room where all the bad stuff was taking place. I had no option but to stay up and wait till I passed out again but would just have another horrible dream.\n\nI eventually remembered my ex had my angel and I wanted it back (just cause of sentimental value) I kept it in my locker and once the dreams kept happening, thought about bringing it home. Once I set it up with my other stuffed animals which were next to my bed on a table I completely stopped having any nightmares and was able to sleep perfectly fine. Since then Ive never experienced anything bad (Apart from what I experienced in my other post where I almost pissed myself) in the attic. Doors opening when I was on the first floor sure or Ive heard heavy footsteps coming from the other room of the attic while I was on the first floor but I've never been up there and had something happen.\n\nId like to think my little Angel was/is keeping whatever is downstairs from coming up or being able to do anything up there. (And now I have two cats up there just cause they keep spooky things away)",

I went down to the basement where Sparks and the other dog, Jonquil were and Sparks said both of them had been down there the whole time as Sparks was sewing and Jonquil was passed out on the floor. \n\nThe next morning I pulled into their driveway to pick them up and saw 2 dog faces in the window, one of them Jonquil, Rhea's bonded buddy and Rhea. Her face was so clear. It looked just like it did every morning when Jonquil and Rhea would be at the window watching me. I never told Sparks and Frosty about seeing her in the window.

He said him and his gf had watched Bigfoot videos all night (he’s really into Bigfoot, lol) and into the early morning before she crashed and went to bed. He stayed up and was sitting in his recliner messing on his phone when he heard 3 distinct knocks at his front door. It was 3:15am. He’s an older guy, but huge and not someone a lot of people would attempt to mess with. He’s 6’4”/6’5” and probably close to 300 pounds. But he is older, in his mid seventies. They live in a smaller city in a duplex that consists mainly of elderly people, some that have older adult children living with them. He checked without opening the door (there’s a huge window by the front door) and no one was there. He had the same thing happen a few months ago so he is extremely freaked out. He said he sat in his chair the rest of the night with his knife on his lap ready to kill someone if  they came in. He doesn’t even like to consider the thought that anything paranormal might be real even though he believes Bigfoot is real. Mainly because I think the idea scares the crap out of him. My husband suggested that I go over and sage for him, but I didn’t know if anyone else might have some advice I could offer him. \n\n\nI know negative energies are attracted to negative energy and his gf is likely to attract negative energy. She’s very nice, but she struggles with abusing their pain medicine and also struggles with depression. BAD. She’s at least 10 years younger than him. She spends most days &amp; nights in bed and cries a lot over her lack of relationship with her children. She’s also attempted to commit suicide before so I don’t know if that could be something to consider as well.",

        "text": "I've had a fair bit of exposure to spirits (or something) in the past, especially at the last house we rented (kitchen utensils clattering at night, heavy footsteps on the floor above, happening consistently), and when I lived in a van for a couple years (strong sense of presence and unreasonable terror, outlines of a visitor/shadow person around a dozen times). Once in a different rental house a door slammed itself when I was across the room and no one was near it, we watched it happen (but didn't feel a sense of terror like in the van). So what's been happening the past few nights is a lot milder, maybe more akin to a deceased family member visiting.\n\nSo this newer thing has been happening on and off for maybe 6 months, happened 3 times this week and last night the footsteps were new. I've been having very vivid dreams (not really nightmares, but some that kept me up), and waking up to my cell phone not charging on those nights (I have a wireless charger that usually works without issue, and I've been making SURE my phone is positioned correctly and charging before I go to bed). \n\nLast night my dog woke me up at 7 AM to poop (normal), so I took her outside and left my wife in bed. When I brought my dog inside, I distinctly heard footsteps upstairs (where she was sleeping), so I assumed she was going to the bathroom. They were very audible, normal volume (older house, easy to hear footsteps when they occur). When I got up stairs, I heard rustling noise in the bathroom so I moved very slowly because I didn't want to startle her. I opened the bedroom door and there she was sleeping. She had never gotten up (I asked). I quickly closed and locked the door and tried to go back to sleep.\n\nIn this house I've heard footsteps before when no one else was around, and the basement door has locked itself (doorknob style lock, twist to lock, very unlikely I did it by accident carrying laundry up). We've also had stuff fly off dressers, get knocked down around the house when no one was nearby, etc. \n\nWhat I'm really curious about is the cell phone charging. Does anyone else wake up with their cell phone dead when it should be charged and have that correlate to visitors/vivid dreams? That seems to be the latest thing for me. Sometimes my wife's phone will be dead too when it happens, but hers charged last night. I don't think it's a power problem, we have a nightlight plugged in next to her phone that stays on all night and hers is plugged into a different outlet than mine. Last night the humidifier was running too and never shut off.",

        "text": "A few months ago, I saw something I cannot explain. I created a Reddit account just so I could tell this story without being looked at like I'm out of my mind. It was a Saturday in October, about noon. I was with some of my friends and  colleagues at a theme park called Kings Island. It is a wonderful place, very high quality, actually has been upvoted as America's favorite theme park on more than one occasion. But, while me and my friends where having fun, feeling like kids again, something, without us knowing, was watching and listening. I was the first one to feel it, I thought I was insane at first, but, I'm not sure anymore. I just felt very uneasy, and I was getting that \"someone or something is watching me feeling\" a lot. I also saw something at the corner of my eye 3 times, but whenever I looked, it would vanish. After the third time, I noticed Lizzy, my friend, and Jon, my boyfriend, having similar uneasy expressions. Looking to the side a lot as well. I whispered in Jon's ear \"Do you keep seeing that too?\" \"Yeah.\" He replied. I then whispered in Lizzy's ear, she said the same. We where having fun and didn't want to spoil the fun, so we just decided it must have been a kid hiding behind a tree, waiting to jump out and say \"boo\" to a friend. Still, we couldn't wipe away how uneasy we felt. Now,  I read stories on reddit without an account about paranormal or weird crap happening to people...I always see variations of the quote \"chill down my spine\" and have never really experienced that. Something about that \"kid\" felt wrong. I felt that chilling feel over and over again. We decided to head over to Orion when I heard something that scared me so much I thought my eyeballs where going to fall out of my skull, and I gagged on my own tongue. \\*SNAP!\\* I swear, something was behind us and stepped on something that broke. We all looked behind us and lying behind us was a light up sword that was snapped in half. Jon tried to reassure me and Lizzy by saying \"This is a popular park, a visitor stepped on it.\" But that was just the problem...This park is normally full of people, in fact, *seconds* ago it was. I *never* cuss but, my god, it was *too fucking* quiet. The only sound we heard was the wind, rocking the swings on the swing ride back and forth, making the overused metal squeak. We just kept moving, thinking nothing of it, but my god, who could have broke that toy? Nobody was there! And the path is a straight shot, there was *no way* someone could have broken it without us seeing. We got in line for Orion, and although the line for that one is usually long, it was very short this time, Jon, being the bro that he is, kept trying to keep our mind off the whole thing. \"We got lucky with our timing, huh?\" He said. I wanted to get my mind off it too, so I let out a pathetic little giggle. We got on the ride, second row from front. The rest of our friends filled 4 other rows. The announcer turned on her microphone and said \"Here you go up and away on Orion. Enjoy your ride and the rest of your day at Kiiiings Island!\" and the ride began. We where at the very top of the hill when Jon violently shook me and pointed at the woods, where we saw trees moving in a path, like something was jumping from tree to tree. It was actually terrifying. We went down the hill, and as we where going hundreds of miles per hour, I SWEAR I could make out a small inhuman face looking at us as we rode the coaster. When we got off, we heard something that sounded like a human scream, but it wasn't a human scream. It sounded *almost* human, but it sounded more like it could be an animal. About 4 hours later, the sun was going down. My friends Amy and Kyle offered to buy us some of the famous Kings Island ice cream. It was an offer we couldn't refuse. And after a few more rides, it was time for the firework show before the closing. So you can get an idea where we where, we where just coming off of Diamondback when the rest of our friends wanted to ride Mystic Timbers before it closes, because of the lack of a line. Jon and Izzy felt bad leaving me alone after we got spooked, and we still couldn't wipe that \"something's watching\" vibe. Once again, when we where nearby Action Zone, it got too quiet again, and we saw something we will never forget. It was crawling on all fours, It had eyes that glowed yellow, it's skin was green, and it had scales all over it's body. It started standing up on it's legs, and it was *huge.* it was TALL! At least 7'5, and the thing *spoke.* The thing screeched and said something under it's breath, none of us could make out any words other than \"harm,\" \"run,\" and \"feed.\" It ran into the woods after that. We didn't get any sleep, and since then, we haven't told anyone about it. It was today when I saw a number of people claiming to see a yellow-eyed creature all throughout Mason and Cincinatti Ohio that I knew it was time to make a Reddit account, and share the story. If anyone has seen this creature, do tell. Thank you for hearing me out. If you know what this thing is, tell me. Until then, goodbye.",

When she died ,a few hours later I turned on the radio and the song \" don't worry ,be happy\" started playing. ( also another song I would mock her because it sounded like you could smoke weed while listening to the song).  \n\nA few weeks went busy after she passed. I was visiting my father . And we were talking about my mother. We were talking about sweet memories we remember about the good old times , and for some reason the lights dimmed 3 times. And never happened again after that .\n\nI'm a tattoo artist and had a first time client today. (I don't talk about my personal life nor post it on any social media) the customer asked me if I was worried about my mom. And I told them kinda yes. The customer then told me I shouldn't worry. She is fine . And she is here with me . How did my customer know this? I started bawling my eyes out . And  to add to this. (I don't control the shops music) my mother was a massive fan of pink Floyd... 1 of their songs started playing . The shop never played pink Floyd before.. \n\nI'm happy to know this might be signs that she is still with me . Well I hope she is",

        "text": "I don't know of this is the right place to post this, it's more of a weird phenomenon than something paranormal but here we go anyways. on mobile so I'm sorry about formatting.\n\n\nlast night I went to my friends house, I drank and smoked so I was definitely not sober. around 2:30 am she wanted a boy to come over but he couldn't drive to her place, her roommate had just come back after drinking basically all day and said that she could drive us and pick him up. I instantly had a horrible feeling, just moments ago she had been stumbling around the house and now she wanted to drive.\n\n\nI have always been warned to not get into anyone's car that had been drinking, it's so ingrained in my brain that when I heard this I got just a horrible feeling. like a stone in my gut and I couldn't shake it. I wanted to say that I'll just stay behind and wait for them but I thought it might have been weird since it isn't even my house, so I went with them. \n\n\nwhen we got in the car the feeling just got so much worse, I felt like I was on the verge of a panic attack. I've done stupid shit while drunk before, like climbing places I shouldn't or jumping from bridges but this time it just felt different. like something was going to go horribly wrong. her roommate started driving and my nerves seemed to calm a little, she isn't a bad driver by any means and that soothed me. it's important to note that I live in Canada and right jow the roads are dangerous and slippery after the recent cold-spell.\n\n\nI mentioned that I had been smoking that night and usually weed makes me tired but I felt too anxious to fall asleep but somewhere along the drive I must have. I don't remember falling asleep at all though, it's like everything that happened was real life. the drive was going fine until one intersection, we were speeding a bit and when she tried to hit the breaks when the light turned red she couldn't stop the car, we slid right into the intersection.\n\n\nanother vehicle slammed into the driver's side of the car, I remember the airbag deploying and that's it. one moment I was there, terrified and thinking of my family who would have to hear that I died in a fucking drunk driving accident, and the next I was sitting in the car like nothing had happened. I freaked out for a moment, I didn't understand what was happening and my friend told me I had passed out for about 10 minutes, that I just had a bad dream or something. I thought I was going crazy but I listened to her and just chalked it up to just a weirdly vivid dream.\n\n\ni think it's important to know I don't drive. I have very little experience on the road and the part of the city that we were in I've rarely gone to but the roads were exactly the same as in my dream, it was like I was having an episode of deja vu or something. I knew exactly what road and every turn she would take before it happened, and then I saw the intersection. the EXACT intersection that I had seen in my dream. I felt a rush of anxiety and immediately I told my friends roommate to slow down because it was slippery and she did. we stopped without trouble and that's when I finally relaxed. it's like all the pent up anxiety and fear left my body instantly and I finally felt safe.\n\n\nthe weirdest part is that the vehicle that drive across the intersection was the one that hit us. it was a red truck, I don't know much about vehicles so I'm not sure which brand or whatever but I know that it was definitely a red truck with that weird Armour on the front.\n\n\nI can't stop thinking about this, I'm sorry if this is badly written I just needed to tell somebody or get all of these feelings out. I have no idea what happened, maybe I told the future or something, or I was just high as balls idk. thanks for bearing with me throughout this, again idk what the proper subreddit is to post this to but I hope this is right lol, also not gonna proofread because lazy :/\n\n\nTLDR: got in a drunk friend's car, fell asleep and had an extremely vivid dream where we got into an accident. woke up and saw the exact intersection where we crashed, stopped friends roommate from speeding and all was good, just a lil freaked out now.",

I looked at him but he was calmly in his sleep ...\n\nI got scared and got up from the bed ... the room's door was always open and I could see the light on on my parents bedroom ... I walked there and found my parents watching the news on the TV so it was around 11pm ...\n\nThey noticed me scared and assumed that me being a 6 year old I was just afraid of the dark ... they let me in on their bed, watched the news for some minutes more and finally turned off the television to sleep, letting me sleep with them between them in the middle of the bed ...\n\nI got asleep soon and I don't know how much time passed but I suddenly awoke again ... I was sleeping face down with my head looking to the only window of the bedroom ... it was all normal there with the usual lights filtering trough the curtains ...\n\nBut I felt the need to look behind me and slowly I started turning my head back ... I found an small source of red light on the wall at my back which was the wall in front of the bottom of the bed, in the direction of my feet so to speak ... it was a light like that of a laser pointer but in those days those things were not available in this country (Venezuela) ... it was less than an inch wide and not so bright ...\n\nThis red luminous point or circle was like two feet above me but one yard away of my feet ... I was there frightened looking at it when it suddenly started to descend ... I felt real fear but suddenly fall asleep again and never had a memory of nothing more happening ... I only remember the next morning, all normal ...\n\nI never said nothing of this to my parents, I don't know why ...\n\nI was totally awake and I could perfectly move during both experiences, first when I heard the voices in my room and later when I saw the light at my parents' bedroom ...\n\nI don't have an explanation for this, never had ... this is not the only strange thing that has happened to me by the way ...",

You know, just play around with different vehicles. \n\nOne day on this particular dirt road, as we were playing with the quadbike, we saw someone walking far down the road. We slowed down and drove forward. As we got closer it first looked like a person that was walking several dogs. \n\nJust to clarify, we were still pretty far away. \n\nWhen we got a little closer it sort of looked like a moose so at this point we stop the quadbike and decided to just watch it. \n\nAs it keeps walking towards us it started to look more like a person again but without any dogs this time. So we decide to start up the quadbike again and we drove towards this person. Now all of a sudden it looked like this person was drunk because it started going side to side on the road, like it couldn't keep its balance so we drove a little faster to check what was going in. When we were pretty close the person fell of the road. \n\nAt this point of time we drove really fast to make sure everything was fine but we couldn't see anyone at all. We had gone pretty far down the road so we was at an open field so if someone would've fallen of the road we would've seen the person but nope, nothing. Just a completely empty field.\n\nWe get pretty freaked out and after a minute or two we hear this gunshot and some sort of moan from an animal or something. \nI can't really explain it but it was a weird sound. The gunshot itself isn't that weird because where we live it's pretty normal for people to go out and hunt animals. \n\nWe didn't think much more of it and just drove back home.\n\nThe next day we decided to go on the quadbike again and we see this figure again way down the road but at this point of time we drive really fast towards it. As we get closer and closer it looks like it turned into a human, then a moose or something and then back to a human, exactly like what happened the day  before. When we got even closer it started losing its balance and started going left and right on the road until it falls off the road again. A minute or two passes and then we here this gunshot again and some sort of moan from an animal. I still can't explain it.\n\nTo this day I still get shivers thinking of it because no matter how much I think about I can't comprehend what It was that we saw.\n\nDoes anyone here have any idea what it might be?",

        "text": "A few years ago, my husband and I were staying in Brighton (UK) for a few nights; a short getaway before I started a new job. I’ll have to ask him the name of the hotel as I cannot remember… but I do remember it was an older building, the inside was pretty modern, and the whole place was like a maze - up and down stairs, through doorways, around corners, through archways, etc.\n\nOur room was set up like any standard hotel room; bathroom situated immediately to the right as you enter the room, bed against one wall and a dresser with a TV on it on the opposite. It seemed like a relatively nice room for the price though, at least by my low standards. \n\nWe were out the whole first day after we arrived, got back to the room around 10:30ish and started to settle down for the evening. I sat on the bed for a while scrolling on my phone while my husband was laying on his side of the bed with all the pillows stacked up behind him so he was nearly sitting up, facing the TV/dresser set up. At this point the whole room was being lit up by one lamp my husband had turned on on his side of the bed. I stood up next to my side of the bed and started to change into my pajamas. As I had my night shirt pulled over my head, arms not even through the arm-holes yet, something made me pause. \n\nSuspended over the dresser, in the empty space about a foot from the TV was a brilliantly bright white/blue ball of light, roughly the size of a football. My mind was racing to make sense of what I was seeing. At first I thought it must be some weird reflection in the picture on the wall behind it, but that just didn’t make sense… the object was clearly 3D, not a reflection. My second thought was that I had had an aneurism and was dying (it happens to 20-something-year-olds all the time!!!). Within milliseconds, the light began to expand. It didn’t just light up the room, it literally grew in size until it completely engulfed the whole room. My third thought was that this must be some type of nuclear warfare, something radioactive, but it didn’t make sense that it was completely silent, it didn’t put off any heat, it didn’t hurt. \n\nIn an instant, it was gone. The room that was lit by one lamp now seemed dark. For a few seconds afterward I couldn’t see anything as my eyes were adjusting back to the one lamp’s worth of light in the room. In my head, that was a physiological sign that I hadn’t imagined this light. \n\nWith my shirt still halfway on, I looked over at my VERY skeptical husband who said “what the FUCK was that??”. It’s cliched to say but I am literally shaking right now typing this out lol. \n\nAt first I thought it might’ve been a camera flash… but that just didn’t make sense. I’ve never seen a camera flash so brilliant… and that’s not exactly the stealthy camera you’d want to hide in a hotel room to spy on guests. We thought it might’ve been something electrical, but the TV worked fine, none of the lightbulbs blew, our phones (that were all plugged in during this) were fine. It just didn’t make sense… the one thing I couldn’t (and still can’t) get over is how the light was literally floating in the middle of the air and the fact that it was such a perfect circle (yes, I know that is two things). \n\nAnyway… I’ve told this story to a few people but no one really knows what to say other than commenting on how odd the story is. Anyone experienced a big glowing ball of light in their hotel room before?? If so, please lemme know.",

        "text": "So i just moved in with my girlfriends dad and stepmother. I'm from the US and for a while me and my girlfriend were in a long distance relationship. I've just recently moved to Sweden and just about three days ago now I've started staying in a spare room in my girlfriend's dad's house. \n\nThe first night i was here I woke up in the middle of the night and i heard the sliding door to the storage room connected to mine rattling back and forth on it's tracks and slightly tapping the wall. When i walked up to the door i could see it slightly moving back and forth. My room is downstairs and sits underground so i chalked it up to vibrations somewhere causing the movement. I checked the room and then opened and shut the door, after that I went back to sleep and i assume the noises stopped. The next day me and my girlfriend slept through the night without any incident, but in the morning i found a torn salt packet on my dresser with some of its contents on the table and floor. I asked my girlfriend but she swears she hasn't put it there and i don't see why anyone else would.\n\nThe weirdest occurrence was definitely last night. I'm typically a skeptical person but i know i felt the presence of something last night. My Girlfriend woke up early this morning to head off to school, and before she left she said that she saw something last night. I remember her waking me up in the middle of the night and complaining that I wasn't giving her enough space, according to her when this happened she saw a black figure standing at the edge of our bed. She said that she thought it was me at first and she was trying to figure out how and when i stood up so quickly, but when she realized that i was on the bed it seemed like it had almost crouched to pick something up and then just turned around and walked away before disappearing. She said she went back to sleep because it felt non threatening and it hasn't worried her at all. After she left for school I went back to sleep for a few hours. I had a quick bout of sleep paralysis but the sensations i had during it were very strange. \n\nI've experienced sleep paralysis before but never anything like this. I felt unable to move and i could barely breathe but the weirdest part of it all is that i literally felt something laying on top of me and caressing my face and running it's fingers through my hair. At first I was relaxed because i thought it was my girlfriend. Like it literally felt like my girlfriend, but once I realized she had already left for school i started to panic and couldn't breathe anymore. It felt like the force that was imposing itself on me was almost angry that i was upset, and it almost felt like i was having a fight for control with this entity inside of my head. Once i regained control over myself it felt like i literally felt the energy detach from me and race away in the direction of the storage room. I took a quick glance at the room around me and saw nothing so i went back to sleep on account of the fact that i was REALLY tired. When i woke up i started thinking about it a little more and now I'm really scared because i have to sleep alone tonight. \n\nBasically I'm just looking for advice or an interpretation? I know my girlfriend said it felt non threatening and for me it did at first as well. But it appears to me that it was literally trying to mimic my girlfriend, and my girlfriend had mistaken the entity for me. To me it almost feels like something evil trying to present itself in a form that it knew each of us would feel comfortable with in order to trick us. I'm going to smudge the are with sage or Palo Santo but i won't be able to until either tomorrow of this weekend. Not looking forward to sleeping alone tonight, or any of the nights that i have to for that matter",

It’s a pretty big church and is quite old it was made in the 1850s. We was sitting down while other people were visiting to pray and it wasn’t during a mass but I had this very strange feeling that I couldn’t shake of this one door. I’m not really a believer in anything of a higher power but I thought I’d check it out so I walked around the church as my girlfriend wanted to and I stopped at that door which made me feel very uneasy. The door was the only door that I could see that had a lock on it while all of the others didn’t have one. I didn’t know it had a lock on it until I walked over to it which I find makes me uneasy feeling even weirder. Does anyone know if my brain is just being stupid or there’s something more here ? If anyone also has questions feel free to ask and also if this post doesn’t belong here please lmk",

I asked if it was me because I was wearing all black and did go in the living room to do something after I woke up, she swears it wasn't me. I was just wondering if we should be concerned because our animals haven't reacted in anyway that would indicate that there was a negative spirit here, but all I see when I look up a black hooded figure is that they're aggressive? I also don't think it was sleep paralysis because she said she turned over and then witnessed the black figure moving. Please help!",

        "text": "*This post is an actual event that took place just a few nights ago, the incident actually happened and scared the heck out of me, which is actually not that easy to do anymore. So this past Wednesday night I decided that I was going to go over to my family cemetery to do some evp and video work, now I do this a lot at my family cemetery, and I get some good evp activity there. Normally I stop about a mile down the road at an old small country church, I do this to pray for protection there because my great grandfather owned and preached there  as well as my great uncle. But for some reason I didn't stop there, instead I went to another spot down the road from the cemetery.*\n\n*I pulled off the road into a drive on some vacant property that my aunt and uncle own, it's surrounded by thick wooded hills and a creek right across the road. I backed into the driveway and parked with the lights on and motor running, I started my video recording and began explaining what I was doing this night, and as I am talking, I am facing the creek, I took note that this was one of those nights where it was very dark, no moon light or anything, and at one point I thought I seen something pop up over the creek bank and ducked back down quickly, I really didn't pay it any mind and kept narrating my video, only to realize that it did it again, I noted mentally that it appeared to be a human type head, either a pale white or a whitish grey.*\n\n*I wasn't feeling scared or anything, but I did realize that the air felt heavier than before, but I pressed onward until it raised up the third time, and I stopped talking because I heard what I thought was a deep male voice, faint, but I heard it. Then in that moment it hit me hard, that fight or flight feeling, that gut instinct for self preservation. I then felt as if something dark or evil was approaching and that it meant serious business.*\n\n*I said out loud no, no, no, I gotta get out of here now, right now, it felt as if I was watching a pissed off Kodiak Grizzly running at me full bore to eat me alive. I threw the truck into drive and punched the gas getting away from the area as quickly as possible. I began reciting the Lords Prayer and praying out loud while demanding that whatever entity had gotten into the truck with me get out. There was a loud double thump directly behind my seat, I yelled very loudly to get out, get out now! I was still praying when I cut the wheel and turned into the church lot, I then called out to my great grandpa and my great uncle to help remove whatever climbed into my truck with me. Between pulling out of the driveway and pulling into the church lot I was jumped twice, each time was very strong and took my breath away.*\n\n*It felt as if every drop of adrenaline had dumped into my system, they felt like a strong panic attack but much worse, I have been told that when that happens, the spirit that you have encountered is jumping into your body to give you a very serious warning, I have had it happen a few times at other locations, but never that hard/strong. But after praying out loud for several minutes the air felt much lighter and the gut feeling subsided. I started reviewing my video/audio and found that just as I said no no no there is a faint male voice that says \"Attack him\", and that it did.*\n\n*Now the creek across from where I was parked has a dark history, my mom and my dad as well as their brothers and sisters all were raised right there in that area. There is a deep hole right there and they would all go there and swim as kids and teenagers. One of my uncles had a best friend that drown in that hole back in the 1960's, my uncle also drown there in the early 1970's, but was revived . It is also the site of a fatal car accident where a young male that was getting ready to leave for Viet Nam lost control of his 57 Chevy and the car ended up on the far bank and caught fire. (the car was never pulled out and some of it is still there today)  My grandmothers both told me for as long as I can remember to stay out of that hole unless I wanted to die. I don't know what I encountered the other night, but it definitely was upset that I was there and it felt evil to say the least.*",

        "text": "all stories secondhand from a source i consider fairly reputable except for the last, which i can corroborate.\n\nfor some background;\n\nmy grandfather died last year (may of 2022) due to complications from a heart surgery. he knew there was a large chance that he wasn't going to make it going in and had made his peace with it--he was a pretty easygoing guy. i think his only regret was that he only married my grandma about eight years ago, even though they'd been dating for almost twenty years at that point.\n\nmy grandma is around seventy-five years old (my grandpa was nearly seventy-nine) and, while her physical health is starting to decline, she's still has a frankly incredibly good grasp of her mental faculties. she does not suffer from dementia or alzheimer's, and to be honest with you her memory is sharper than mine in some aspects--she's fully retained her ability to tell funny stories from forty years ago in perfect detail, at any rate, and while she does have a tendency to misplace things, i lean towards attributing that to her tiny, cluttered house rather than any worsening forgetfulness on her part.\n\nmy grandma, however, doesn't work--hasn't for several years. my grandpa was a carpenter before he died (i know, right? at almost eighty!) and made most of the money for the house, occasionally supplemented by my grandma selling off some of her artwork once in a while (she's a fairly accomplished artist). since he's died, she's had trouble with money--she's had to go on food stamps, and depends somewhat on my mom/my uncle/my aunt to help keep her water and electricity on. my grandma is also a collector of various things (it's not quite on the level of hoarding but, you know, it's in the zone) and recently decided to sell off some of her more valuable things (antiques and such) to help pay for things. she started by going through her jewelery box, and eventually decided to take some of my grandpa's rings to the pawn shop.\n\naside from his wedding ring, which she kept, he had a few silver rings and even one gold one that she wanted to sell, but couldn't find the gold one. she was very busy at the time and wanted to do this before she got distracted/started a new project, so it kept her up late into the night looking for the last ring. eventually, she heard a noise from the closet of the bedroom. she went in with a broom at the ready--they've had problems with mice before--but no rodents jumped out when she opened the door. actually, nothing was in there at all. but she realized she hadn't looked in that closet for the ring, so she started shuffling some stuff around and searching when all of a sudden something small and heavy hit her in the face. i don't mean that it fell off of a shelf--i mean it *hit* her, from straight on, hard like someone *threw* it.\n\nshe knelt down to pick up the object, and it was my grandpa's gold ring.\n\nsince then, she says other things have happened. not really horror-movie-cliche type stuff, and for some reason the niche specific weirdness of it all makes me more inclined to believe it than i would be if it was your standard flickering lights, doors closing, etc. instead, she says it's along the lines of--weird, spooky feelings she gets, like someone's in her house, not to do anything malicious but just because they live there. my grandpa had hand-carved a mantlepiece for their fireplace almost a decade ago, and she says she can smell the fresh stain that'd been there when it was new, even though neither of them have repainted it in years. her dog--a very fat, very spoiled dachshund--barks and whines at nothing, staring out the window to where my grandpa's truck doesn't park anymore, like he can hear it pulling in the driveway. \n\nshe says once, just before thanksgiving, she was lying in her bed on the left side, trying to get to sleep (my grandma is a notorious insomniac), when she felt someone get in bed with her. she didn't turn around as the mattress dipped down and the blankets moved--it was definitely a person, not the dog--and she could hear my grandpa tell her goodnight, and could feel his foot touch hers as he settled in. she didn't sleep all night, and when she finally got the courage to turn around a few hours later, there was no one there.\n\nthis last thing, the thing i was there for, happened over the summer. as mentioned, my grandma's been having money troubles, so we cleared out the garage and my grandpa's office to see if there was anything in there my grandma would be okay with selling. we decided to get rid of his model car collection (not hot wheels, they're like 1:18 scale die cast), which contained at least two hundred cars. my grandma can't really comprehend ebay, so i volunteered to do it, since my mom and stepdad were busy with other things and i didn't really trust my cousins (all guys in their twenties) to be careful with stuff. \n\nin between cleaning out the display shelves in the workshop/office (do not recommend; LOUSY with spiders) and trying not to kill myself by falling off the stepladder trying to get cardboard boxes down from the garage rafters, i started to hear weird, creaky noises from the direction of the workshop. (i mentioned my grandpa was a carpenter; this was like a cross between where he kept his work tools and his little \"man cave\", or whatever. he was the only one who ever went in, is the point.)\n\ni went completely still and silent, trying to see if i was the one accidentally making noise, but they kept going. it sounded like something being moved that wasn't used to being moved, all disjointed and squeaky.\n\ni was alone, so i got a little nervous--i was already on edge from all the creepy bugs i'd been battling and i didn't really want an encounter with a possum or something--and i went around to the front of the house and got my cousin. when we went back to the garage, the noises had stopped, but started up again the second my cousin stepped into the vicinity of the office. i asked if he could hear the noise, and he said he could. i told him to stay outside while i went into the office so he could tell me if the noises got any louder.\n\ni went in, my cousin peeking his head in the doorway after me, and i could immediately see that the source of the sound wasn't an animal, like i'd feared. it was the doors of all three display cases--which i'd latched after removing the model cars from them--open and swinging on their hinges.\n\nthe only thing that's happened that i can't really find an explanation for is the ring being thrown at my grandma. again, it's not like it fell; it hit her head on, with force. everything else--i don't know. dreams, paranoia, grief. a slightly senile dog. latches breaking on display cases that haven't been opened in seven years. whatever.\n\nmy mom believes me, and so does my stepdad, but they're both religious in varying weird ways (my stepdad's a very lax catholic, my mom's some sort of... i don't know, neo-spiritual meditation weirdo. we're cherokee, you can imagine how she gets). my cousin believes me--at least, he thinks something's weird about the shelves in the office, i don't know his thoughts on anything else that's happened--and he's pretty skeptical, whatever that's worth. my twin brother thinks everybody's nuts.\n\ni don't know what to think, really. sorry i don't have photo or video evidence of anything, and sorry to end this kind of lamely. if anyone wants to give their thoughts or whatever in the comments, i'd be happy to listen. thanks for reading.",

(Again my first language is not english so sorry for any grammar errors)\n\nMy grandparents lived on a little hill next to a big forest.. it was like a mini village up there with only a few houses. We had a very big garden in which I would play all the time. Someday a little boy showed up outside our garden fence and I was so excited to see him because I was the only 6-7 year old kid in the neighborhood and he looked like my age, so I went up to him and greeted him. He was very polite and we agreed on playing together. After this day we almost played everytime when I was at my grandparents house. Either in our garden or in front of the forest. He never wanted to go inside our house which I was a little bummed about.. I wanted to show him all of my toys we had been talking about but oh well, we always had so much fun together outdoors so I stopped asking him to come inside. \n\nAfter a few months my grandmother was invited to a neighbors house for some coffee and cake, I was in as soon as I heard the word cake. So we went over and as I walked into the house I saw a picture of my now friend that I have been playing with for months. So I said out loud “Hey that’s the boy I’ve been playing with!” our neighbor looked at me dumbfounded and said “Darling that’s not possible.. that is my son that passed away 20 years ago”.  We never really talked about him again and I can’t quite remember when but like he showed up someday, he vanished. We also had to move away from that house so that might have been the time he didn’t show up anymore.",

There was one night when it got really bad that it was so hard to breathe, weirdly enough there was a constant chill where the bed in the room was yet other parts of the room were hot because it was the middle of the summer, also to make things ten times worse my brother is a heavy sleep talker so id be shaken from him randomly screaming or talking in his sleep. On the same night and thought I could hear what sounded like my brother talking but the more I listened it wasn't coming from his direction. I look out the corner of my eye and I can see what looks like a tall shadow figure standing there just watching me, it then whispers but I can't make it out what it's trying to say I try to turn my head to get a better view but I can move my body my limbs are stiff and I could feel a pressure begin to set on my chest as it gets heavier It starts to move towards me to the point where it's right beside my bed, the more I fight against the pressure the stronger it got I could feel my eyes start to close, the last thing I saw was it touch my little brother and point at me but had no sound, I screamed at it to ward it off but it was as if my voice was taken away, I then fell asleep after that. That's all I can remember about that. but ever since that day, I've never seen it again. Ever since that day, I've become cold all the time no matter how warm I try and get.",

Prior to me being in the building, the energy that filled the space was completely different, more chaotic. It's a very chill atmosphere now and a beacon of light in the community. Anywho...\n\nAt the end of the night after the customers have left and I'm writing or just reflecting, I'll hear various noises. Undeniable loud noises like doors closing or even pieces of conversations that sound very \"ghostly\". I am not the only one to experience these sounds either. Multiple people have heard the spirits or spirit as well at the same time.\n\nA few nights ago I was had burned some Palo Santos and lit a candle as I wrote a very thunderous poem in the Café. I was very into it and could the chills of me reciting it outloud feeling very proud of the expression I was exuding. As I got up from my chair, I blew out the candle as some ashes from Palos Santos hit the ground. At that very moment I hear a chair scoot very loudly as if a customer was getting up to leave. It was so in my face obvious like the spirit wanted me to definitely acknowledge its presence. I was a little freaked out at first as I was the only one there but quickly calmed by curiosity that had me investigate to make sure I was indeed the only one in there and surely enough, I was. \n\nI've chosen to no longer be afraid but just accept whatever may be floating around in the unseen adding a flavor to the energy of the Café. Perhaps it is there to assist me in some way. Who knows, but I do know, that it's real as fuck.",

I had retaken photos of an item using a new background, and an old one I had discontinued long before showed up. There wasn't a mixup. It was an old electronic handheld candyland game I had opened to make sure the batteries didn't leak after a potential asked if it works. Recent photo in its newly opened condition with a background I had stopped using almost 1 year prior.",

        "text": "I'm hoping maybe someone can give me clarity as to what is going on with me. Long story short, from about 9 - 15, I grew up on base in a high rise tower that I believe was haunted. Idk if the whole building was haunted or just our unit. I had several experiences there I can't explain, from seeing shadows dart across my parents room to mine, to hearing whispering directly in my hear, to having stuff randomly go missing even though it was in a specific place, and to dreams that terrified me. I haven't lived in this place since 15, I'm almost 30 now but ever since we left, I've struggled with horrible graphic nightmares that always take place in that unit or around it. Idk why this place is still in my head, the dreams I have are very graphic and feels evil, not anything that I ever think about on the daily. Can anyone help me understand why this is still happening and why I every dream I have with this place is so negative and violent? Also if you've had any experiences with any of the things I've mentioned please I'd like to hear about it...I have yet to have an explanation for my experiences in this place",

        "text": "I'm not sure what happened. \n\nYesterday, my boyfriend and I were having an argument over the phone. It was getting pretty heated and i was getting madder and madder. I was sitting in my recliner and just as I was about to lose it on him, I heard a large popping sound behind me. I thought it was a gunshot thru my window.\n\n I turned around and a medium sized vase that held combs on my desk had literally exploded. I was so confused. I looked to see if something had fallen on it from the side, from above, anywhere. There was nothing. Nothing around it, nothing out of place. It looked as if it had fallen over facing my chair but there was no reason for it to have fallen. It's a decent sized vase and only had two or three pocket sized combs in it. \n\nI'm actually terrified my anger caused it to break. I was so angry and the pop sound came at the height of it. My mom and daughter actually yelled to ask if I was ok bc they heard it from two separate parts of the house. I'm not a huge believer in the paranormal but I absolutely cannot find a rational reason for what happened. \n\nWhat do you all think?",

Both times it has been seen it was seen the basement looking at the person who saw him.\n\nI've had some other experiences, like, I was sitting in my living room when all of the sudden, my candle flew off my coffee table.\n\nOr one time I was eating breakfast before work, which I usually do in the kitchen but it is attached to my living room, but I had a guest sleeping there, so I ate in the dinning room, in the farthest chair from the door as to not wake her up.\n\nI only have one light on and that is in the room behind the dining room, the front door, as I'm eating I hear the light switch click, and then it goes dark. \n\nI'm not scared so I get up to turn it on. And as I start moving to the room I feel an intense feeling of dread, one I haven't felt before for any of the experiences, so I get my phone light to turn it on instead.\n\nNone of the events scare me ever, but should I be scared?",
