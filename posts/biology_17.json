        "text": "I'm Jordan Smith, Founder and CEO of SCINET. We are building a life sciences ecosystem of Web3 software Dfinity's Internet Computer Protocol to increase the speed, accuracy, and efficiency of life sciences research! We have received two grant awards from Dfinity, and given back to the ICP community by creating an elastic search function available to any building on ICP.\n\nWe are currently in the final 4.5 hours of Round 1 of SweaterVC's Barnburner competition. This competition is like a cross between Shark Tank and America's Got Talent. In Round 1, all we have to do is gain enough votes to be in the top sixty companies (top 15 in our category) by the end of the night tonight.\n\nAs of this morning, we were, but we slipped and need more help from the US-based crypto community. Please be our valentines!\n\nBelow is the post Dfinity themselves posted about our project recently.\n\n[https://twitter.com/dfinity/status/1625095299961167873?s=20&amp;t=PKCC-WWva8bOIJ56VnaK4g](https://twitter.com/dfinity/status/1625095299961167873?s=20&amp;t=PKCC-WWva8bOIJ56VnaK4g)\n\nIt costs nothing but a couple minutes to vote for us here: [https://link.sweaterventures.com/HIpQ/SCINETINC](https://link.sweaterventures.com/HIpQ/SCINETINC). When the link is working properly, all you have to do is download the app to your phone, create an account, search for SCINET under \"Barnburner\", and \"heart\" us. If for whatever reason it gives you issues, the Sweater app is available on both Apple and Android app stores.\n\nIf you'd like to know more about SCINET, check our [linktr.ee/scinet](https://linktr.ee/scinet).

        "text": "Lichens. For you, in your day-to-day life, lichens are probably very inconsequential. You don’t even see them, even when you directly look at them. They’re just part of the pavement, or of a branch. Just some texture. **But to us biologists, lichens are… a blessing and a curse.** They defy all our attempts of categorizing living things. They remind us of the inconvenient, unpleasant, and awkward truth that there is actually no such thing as a “species”. The concept of species is incoherent, incomplete, and may sometimes even be counter-productive. Same goes for all the groups of living things. Genera, Families, Orders, Kingdoms, Domains, it’s all rubbish. I should take the EvolutionEisenbahn railroad plan \\[that depicts the Tree of Life as connected train stations; see EvolutionEisenbahn on YouTube\\] and rip it to shreds! This is not how biology truly works. And most of all the lichens have taught us that. And how? I will tell you in a minute. But let me first take a step back. Because this is only the second lesson they gave us. The first one is almost as important, though: **They taught us that symbiosis exists.** Yes, we used to believe that all interactions between different species were competition. That necessarily one would always exploit the other. One master and one slave. But this was just so blatantly not true for the lichens, we had to accept, if reluctantly at first, that there is such a thing as a truly mutualistic relationship, symbiosis. And now, of course, we find it everywhere and it seems obvious. Thanks to lichens.\n\nGenerally, you get a lichen when a fungus and an alga grow together. The fungus offers mainly minerals and protection, the alga offers sugar it produces from photosynthesis. Only together can they grow on naked stone and make a living in these harsh conditions, slowly, dissolving the stone, grinding it down to soil. Lichens cover about 8% of the Earth’s surface, that’s more than is covered by rainforests. They produce many important compounds and dyes, for example litmus. And where they grow and where they do not grow tells us many things about the environment there. They are so-called bioindicators. For example, some are very sensitive to pollution, so if they vanish, you know pollution is rising. On the other hand, they are extremely insensitive to other things, like drying out or cold or cosmic radiation! Nothing survives better in space than lichens and **I bet they will be the first thing growing on Mars.**\n\nOkay, but what is a lichen, then? Is it a fungus or is it a plant? And it gets even worse: A lichen is actually never just two things. There can be several fungi involved. And several algae. As well as bacteria. \n\nSo, you see, a lichen is not a… well, not a thing? Well, obviously it is a thing, but… I have a hard time finding a word. So, they’re not a fungus. But some parts of them are. Others are plants or bacteria or other funguses. Every lichen is kind of an organism made up of different organisms, a community, you could even say, an ecosystem. And there you see the problem. If we want to put the lichens on the Tree of Life, where do we put them? With the fungi? With the plants? With the bacteria? And which of these, if the lichen contains several different fungi, for example?\n\nSo, you see, speaking of different “species” of lichens is kinda absurd. And we don’t even know where to put them! But we have more or less arbitrarily decided to categorize them according to the main fungal component and view the rest of the constituents as symbionts or parasites or something in between.\n\nPlus, a lichen is not a fixed thing in time either! Their evolution is really convoluted. Sometimes the partners separate again and form lichens with other partners. Or just stay separate for good. And lichens are “re-invented” all the time too. Things lichenize and de-lichenize and re-lichenize. It’s crazy.\n\n**Now you might think, well, lichens are weird, so what? Why should I care?** Yes, but what if we are all lichens? What if all living things are like lichens? Don’t you have symbionts too? Aren’t there gazillions of microorganisms that live on and in you? Some of them vital for your health and survival? Isn’t at least 8% of your genome virus DNA? If you look closer, all living things are actually communities of living things, evolving together. Is there even such a thing as an individual? Maybe instead of evolution, it should be called “involution”, because all living things are involving into each other, getting more and more involved with each other. Look outside. The trees, the insects, the fungi. All involved with each other. There is truth to that cliche idea that all life on this planet is connected. \n\nAnd the humble lichens are a symbol for these humbling lessons: Life defies our attempts to put it into neat categories of species and families and kingdoms and domains. Still, I will not rip the railway plan \\[that depicts the Tree of Life in neat categories\\] to shreds. Instead, I invite you to see all these categories for what they truly are: Useful concepts, but not the whole truth. But these concepts are useful to understand the truth. **Life is too messy and complex to be understood by us at face value.** We need to use metaphors and concepts and models. The only danger lies in forgetting that we are using those and thus losing the proper humility. \n\nSo, do me a favor, next time you see a humble lichen grow on a stone, on a piece of dead wood, or on a wall, get down on its level, look at it carefully, and think about Life.",

        "text": "Manuscript: \"Roses are red\"\n\nReviewer 1: The manuscript presents descriptive analyses on the colours of two Angiosperms of the clade Eudicots. Frankly, the text makes extraordinary claims without providing any substantive evidence. Current knowledge clearly suggests that plants from the genus *Rosa* come in many different colours, for example *Rosa stellata* has purple flowers and *Rosa arvensis* white ones. Therefore, the authors of this text are implicitly proposing a seismic shift in the tree of life, removing (most) roses from their current phylogenic position into different clades. Given this radical proposal is without basis I cannot recommend the publication of this text.\n\nReviewer 2: The manuscript presents an analysis of colour using Angiosperms as model organisms. The text is concise and well written without scientific jargon. Since conventional wisdom states that plants of the genus Rosa are diverse in colour, this study represents a substantial novelty in the field. In particular, the conclusion that flowers that we perceive as non-red (such as *Rosa arvensis*, commonly thought of as white) are in fact red, is a dazzling finding. Given the remarkable nature of the these results and their wide-ranging implications, I am very supportive of publication of this text.\n\nReviewer 3: What are roses? What is red? These are highly fundamental and abstract scientific questions. I am in two minds about this manuscript. On the one hand it tries to address these important questions for which the current biological literature is frankly lacking. On the other hand, the text is highly dogmatic in stating \"Roses are red\" without presenting any data. Indeed, it reads more like an opinion piece than a research article. At the very least, I suggest revisions to tone down the main text, something like \"Roses might be red\".\n\nEditorial Decision: Rejected, Happy Valentines Day!",

        "text": "Hi, I’m not a biologist so pls forgive what’s probably a naive question. \n\nI was thinking today about evolution and how amazing it is that my body can regulate itself: I was in the gym and my heart rate got to 165bpm and I was like “wow, that’s cool, I hope I don’t die… why wont I die?” I thought I must be to do with breathing and how oxygen helps the heart somehow, like how when you’re stressed 5 deep breaths really helps. Anyway, this took me on a train of thought about how incredible it is that complex living things naturally occur in the first place. I understand the argument that it happens because there is no alternative, something can’t evolve “wrong” because if it successfully survives it’s not wrong in the first place. What I don’t understand, and what my question really is to you bio boffins, is why isn’t there more trial and error in evolution? Why don’t we see more examples of animals that just don’t work? Why at the very early stages isn’t there an example of animals that tried to breathe and just really fucked it up and they had to go back to step 1? Every animal we know of works, even one’s that died out died out because of natural causes like meteors, where’s the mistakes?!",

That is to say a mother with a altruistic child will have a higher direct fitness than one that doesn’t. \n\nWouldn’t this in turn violate the “zero effect” set out by Hamilton on parental fitness?",
