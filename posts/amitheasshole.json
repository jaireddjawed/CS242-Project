[{"title":"AITA Monthly Open Forum March 2023: Rule 11","author":"AITAMod","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/11f5yjn\/aita_monthly_open_forum_march_2023_rule_11\/","text":"#Keep things civil. Rules still apply.\n\n\nThis month, we\u2019re diving into all things rule 11. It\u2019s one of our broadest rules, and often one of the most misunderstood.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the most common question - isn\u2019t every post on this sub about some type of relationship? Yes, of course. One of the basic requirements of this sub is to post about interpersonal conflicts. And those typically don\u2019t exist without some type of relationship (barring the random encounter with a stranger on the street, etc.).\n\nWhat we look at is the nature of the relationship. When reviewing a post for rule 11, we ask ourselves if the conflict could exist outside the confines of a romantic relationship. Can this conflict exist between two friends, roommates, family members? If the answer is no, then it\u2019s a rule 11 violation. A post about buying an engagement ring, considering a divorce\/break-up, \u201ccatching feelings\u201d for someone, romantic jealousy, dating, engaging in sexual acts, etc. are part of this rule. Choosing to not do any of the aforementioned also qualifies. \n\nu\/CutlassKitty gave a fantastic example in Januray\u2019s Open Forum that sums this part of the rule up nicely:\n > So \"AITA for telling my boyfriend to clean up after himself\" is allowed because it isn't about the relationship itself. But \"AITA for wanting affection from my partner\" isnt.\n\nBorrowing from another user\u2019s examples, u\/stannenb gave this, also in January\u2019s Open Forum:\n> I think pineapple on pizza is an abomination. I've told my spouse if they have to indulge in something demonic like that, do it outside the home. AITA?\n> I think pineapple on pizza is an abomination. I've told my spouse that if they indulge in something demonic like that, I'm going to leave them. AITA? \n> The first conflict, about pineapple pizza within a relationship, is fine.\n> The second conflict is about ending the relationship because of pineapple pizza and would be removed.\n\nHowever, rule 11 does not solely cover romantic relationships. It also covers cutting contact with\/ghosting others. That includes family members and friends. Disclosing details of cheating also is covered and is often a reason for a post removal. \n\nReproductive autonomy decisions, such as having a child (or not), keeping the pregnancy (or not), and adoption also fall under rule 11. We have included situations about who to allow in a delivery room under this umbrella, as these conflicts regularly lead to breakups\/divorce or involve threats for the same.\n\n\nYou might be asking \u201cWhy aren\u2019t these topics allowed here?\u201d There\u2019s a couple answers to that question. One is that 99% of these questions are essentially about consent. We all recognize that anyone has the right to revoke consent at any time, whether that\u2019s in direct relation to sex or just in terms of staying in contact with someone, or anything in between. This isn\u2019t a matter that we can give moral judgement on; we simply cannot condone allowing a post where people tell someone they were wrong to exercise their right to consent. Another answer is that Reddit is a big place, and there are a ton of subs dedicated to relationships, etc. The answer there is simple - we have no interest in being another relationship sub. r\/findareddit is a great resource if you\u2019re not sure which sub is a good fit for your post.\n\n___\n\n#As always, do not directly link to posts\/comments or post uncensored screenshots here.

My boys are now 12 and 9. Once a year me and the boys go to my families vacation home with the entire family and up until this year, my fiance did not attend. But now that we are engaged and merging families, the family asked that he come too (they all get along great with him anyways). I explained to him prior to us coming to our family retreat that during our week stay with the family, my kids do not have a bedtime. We do a lot of night activities, such as night swimming in the pool, karaoke, fires, nightly strolls through the neighborhood, etc etc. So during this week, my kids absolutely do not have a bedtime and this is how it has always been. I made it clear that bedtime was not to be enforced like it was at home because this is vacation and time with family and I'm not making my kids miss out on the nightly activities. I also explained that due to this, some nights they are up until easily 11-midnight. It's once a year, it's no big deal. So he was fully aware and please note that this is the only time I've seen this side of him that I will mention below.\n\nWe get here the first night and you can tell he is already uncomfortable with the boys staying up past their bedtime. He was stressing out because the boys were still in the pool at 10pm and he felt they should be in bed already. I reminded him at least twice that we were not enforcing a bedtime here and he let it go the first night. The second night 9pm rolls around and the boys were still up and my fiance was dropping comments like \"you're lucky you're even still awake right now, you should be in bed\". Saying it right in front of my mom, who looked mortified that he had such an attitude. I told him to cut the fucking shit, in private. He tells me he thinks it's fucked up and that it's going to be terrible trying to get them back on their schedule (never been an issue in the years prior). I stood firm and told him to knock it off and let it go. \n\nBut then last night my fiance starts angry sighing every single time he looks at my kids still awake and I finally pulled him aside and told him he was a fucking embarrassment because he keeps saying these comments in front of my family, which leads to awkward silences and judgemental glances my way. I warned him prior to coming here and if he had an issue that he can't control for a week than he needs to leave because he's ruining our trip with his passive aggressive BS surrounding a bedtime. He told me I'm an AH for making him feel like garbage over wanting to keep the kids on a schedule because it's \"best for them\".

I'm also the planner and the giver in not only my family (husband and kids) but my extended family (parents, siblings, friends, etc), so I'm the one that plans birthday get togethers, gifts, travel etc. I'm also a SAHM due to having a son with complex medical and behavioral needs. I've been with him 24\/7 for the last week as it's school break and he's extremely clingy and has behavioral problems due to mental illnesses. I also had a upper respiratory cold during this time, sore throat, fever, cough, runny nose, ear ache. But kept up with mom duties none the less.\n\nMy husband's birthday was last month and as usual I planned something for him. Weekend in a town a couple hours away for us and our kids. \n\nFor my birthday I tell him I just want help with the kids, the house cleaned, a nap, and him to cook supper or take me out. Maybe a homemade gift from the kids and a cake. \n\nYesterday, my husband starts complaining of a sore throat. I check his throat and looks fine. No fever or other symptoms.  He stays up all night playing video games. \n\nThis morning he says he is sick, but has no visible symptoms.  No fever, no cough, no runny nose, doesn't sound like someone with a cold. He says his throat hurts but spent an hour on XBox live talking just fine. \n\nHe naps all day because he says he's sick, I think it's because he stayed up until 4 a.m. playing video games. Meanwhile I make my own cake, take care of the kids as usual, and do my usual chores. He didn't even tell me happy birthday.  \n\nFinally I decided to take the cake I made with the kids to my parents house to have supper there so I didn't have to cook. I'm pretty crabby at this point and don't say a word before we leave. He calls and asks why we left. I tell him because he ruined my birthday yet again and I'm trying to salvage it at least a little and hung up. He called back and said I was overreacting. He's sick and I'm an adult, birthdays aren't a big deal anymore after 21. \n\nSo AITA for wanting 1 day to be the receiver instead of the giver?

I am getting married later this year. We have pretty much everything planned. My sister (a year younger than me) got engaged last year and announced her wedding day as the same as mine a while ago. All our cousins said they would go to my wedding. This led to her and my parents reaching out after being low contact with them for years (will explain more in just a sec) and saying we should do a double wedding and she won't miss out. I found it such a ridiculous request and said so and told them I would never do a double wedding with her. They act like I was sooo rude.\n\nBG: Sister has always been an attention hog. Our parents encouraged it. But she's also the mean girl. When we were kids the adults really loved her and thought she was such a perfect girl but to me, to our cousins, she was awful. She was a bully. A few times she would actively tell me when she was planning to take attention from me on my birthday or my graduation. She was like that with our cousins as well. Sometimes it was getting attention on her and getting whoever's birthday it was in trouble. She made up so many lies about us. So I ended up low contact with them (her and my parents) as adults. I know from my cousins she hasn't changed at all. Last time I saw her was before Covid and she tried to say I stole her food.\n\nSo I said what I said when asked to do the double wedding and the flying monkeys have started coming for me, in the form of aunts and uncles, who think I'm selfish for refusing. They say I might have had the date first but I could accommodate since my sister is always left out by me and my cousins. I was accused of being a bully for saying I would never do a double wedding with her the way I did. They said it was so nasty.\n\nAITA?","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1678648018.0},{"title":"AITA for calling my son inconsiderate?","author":"RealisticPeach8977","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/11pkvb8\/aita_for_calling_my_son_inconsiderate\/","text":"Throwaway account for privacy reasons.\n\nI(46f) have twins (19m) and another son (16m). My son loves to cook and bake. To him it\u2019s his source of relaxation. Alfredo, burgers, pizza, you name it. Heck even a whole cake he can make it. Everyone who\u2019s met him knows he\u2019s a fantastic cook.\nHowever, he prefers to only cook for himself and gets really annoyed when my twins walk in on him cooking and ask him to make them food as well. He\u2019ll end up doing it but he does it very begrudgingly and usually gives them a much smaller portion than his own serving, which my twins don\u2019t like. They both have jobs, and will sometimes use their job money to buy us all a little fast food. So they find it really upsetting how their younger brother never returns the favor by primarily cooking for himself.\nThe other day, neither of my twins had class and weren\u2019t really in the mood for the food that we had in the house. My son came back from school and decided to make himself some banana pudding. When my twins asked for some as well, he told them they could just make it themselves and the ingredients were all still there.\nMy son put the banana pudding in the fridge and went to go take a shower while it was chilling. When he came back down he saw that my twins had eaten it all and this really upset him. \nWhen he told me about the situation I confronted the twins to which they said it was really rude for him to only make something for himself knowing that they were hungry as well and like he said, he could always make some more. I told my son that while they shouldn\u2019t have eaten his food that they were right, and he was very inconsiderate. My son replied that it\u2019s not fair how he gets back from school and is expected to make food for his older siblings. That they can just get a cookbook and learn how to make things for themselves. I told my son that if he\u2019s not going to cook for everybody than he can\u2019t cook anymore. \nHe\u2019s been pretty moody ever since. Obviously his brothers shouldn\u2019t have eaten his food but it takes no effort to just make a larger portion of the food he\u2019s cooking so that everybody can have it.

I\u2019ve counted, and it\u2019s been ten times in the past month and half that he has stayed with me. He has only stayed with me three times since March started, only on the weekends. When he comes over, it is always in the evening when we are coming home from bars, after spending the entire day working on his house, and he leaves first thing in the morning to continue working on reno. It might be hard to believe, but we are almost never in shared spaces. Truly almost NEVER. The man really is just there to have a roof over his head while he sleeps. \n\nEdit** I said he sometimes works from my place on weekdays, but it has been maybe three Fridays, I am always home on those Fridays, because I work part time, and my roommate is not home because she also has a job. \n\nEdit 2** my boyfriend is pretty much only actually at the apartment at night so that we can sleep; the only real space he is taking up is in my bed.\n\nEdit 3** my roommate, and I have had multiple discussions about my boyfriend staying over a little more frequently at night, and every single time she has maintained that it does not bother her. \n\nEdit 4** he got this house so we can move in together. He will have floors in his house by the end of March, and will no longer need to stay with us as often. My lease is up in June, and I will move into the house with him.\n\nI (22f) have lived with my roommate (24f) for about two years. My bf (28m) and I have been together since before my roommate and I moved in together. Currently, he lives an hour away from me, a couple towns over. About a month and a half ago, he was able to purchase a house in my town and has been renovating it. As is, it is unlivable. There are no floors in the entire house, so staying there is not an option. It also doesn\u2019t make sense for him to drive the hour back home when I live two minutes from the new house. Today, my roommate texted me and said she wants to have a conversation about how often he\u2019s been staying over. Over the past month and a half, he has stayed over about two nights a week on average. Sometimes three nights, sometimes one. It is almost always during the weekend. He is repairing the house during the day, and we will go out at night or sometimes chill at my place after. Maybe 3-4 times TOTAL during this entire month and a half, he has worked from my apartment (he works from home) on a week day (it\u2019s usually a Friday) but he always works in my room so as to not take up our shared space, such as the kitchen table. I am also always home when he is there. I have my own room and bathroom, so he isn\u2019t taking any of her personal space whatsoever. I will also mention that our utility bills have NOT increased whatsoever during this time - I checked. Who is the a**hole here? Am I wrong to think she\u2019s be unreasonable? This hasn\u2019t ever been a problem during the last two summers for example, where he stayed most weekends after going to the beach and hanging with friends. I don\u2019t see why it\u2019s suddenly an issue now. \n\nSide note: I go to see him at his place all the time (usually at least once a week) and have complained to my roommate on many occasions that I wish he\u2019d come to me one or two nights a week so I don\u2019t have to drive as much, so I\u2019ve been extremely happy that the new house means he comes to me more.

We live in a fairly warm state, and the HOA is very strict about it. We even have little flags at the front of the yard that the grass isn\u2019t allowed to get taller then. \n\nSo the point is. The lawn needs to be mowed. I don\u2019t want to do it. My wife can\u2019t because the last time she mowed a lawn she tipped into a lake. \n\nJust so happens I know a guy who owns a goat, and I offer him $20 to bring it over to eat the grass for me. \n\nThe goat eats the grass, we keep her away from the neighbors yards, goat goes home. It was great! Way better than mowing. \n\nExcept now my wife is mad because some of the neighbors saw the goat and think it\u2019s hysterical that we had a goat doing yard work for us.

I should be excited, but this whole situation has caused me a lot of anxiety because I\u2019m 8 months pregnant and she isn\u2019t happy about it.\n\nYou see, Sarah and her fianc\u00e9 Dave got engaged two years ago and decided they\u2019d get married on their anniversary which is so sweet and very them. \n\nAs Sarah\u2019s MOH, I\u2019ve been helping her plan and navigate through all of the many complicated feelings that go with being a bride- especially with setting boundaries with family members who don\u2019t understand that this wedding is about Sarah and Dave and not them. \n\nOne of the major setbacks was the fact that they want to have a childless wedding. Because of Sarah\u2019s anxiety, I took up deescalate some of her family members that demanded to be \u201cthe exception\u201d and was able to help talk down all of the people who felt entitled to this wedding.\n\nAll was well with the world until I found out I was pregnant. My husband and I have been actively trying to have a baby for the past few years with no luck. I have some medical issues which make having children extremely challenging for me, and when I found out I thought Sarah would be happy for me but she told me I was incredibly selfish.\n\nShe did the math and figured out I\u2019d be due around the date of her wedding- which (she reminded me) I knew about well in advance. I tried to explain myself, but she wouldn\u2019t hear it. She said if I was really her friend, I would have planned around her wedding.\n\nI told her I realized she was hurt, but I wasn\u2019t about to put my plans on hold for her. She got even more upset. She didn\u2019t understand how I could spend all that time telling her loved ones not to bring children to her wedding only to turn around and do it myself.\n\nI was shocked. I\u2019m not due until the week after her wedding so technically wouldn\u2019t be bringing a baby to the wedding. She then expressed how she was concerned about me going into labor at her wedding and started crying. I assured her that wouldn\u2019t happen, and for the past couple of months she\u2019s been bringing this concern up to me repeatedly and making comments about my body changing and the pictures, etc.\nShe\u2019s mentioned more than once she\u2019s worried I\u2019ll be taking attention away from her and now I\u2019m starting to believe it.\n\nLast night some of the other brides maids went out drinking with Sarah and I guess my pregnancy came up again because I\u2019ve received quite a few texts and snaps telling me that I\u2019m a bad friend and don\u2019t deserve to be a part of this wedding. They\u2019ve even called me an AH for planning my pregnancy during the wedding. AITA?\n\nEdit: thank you all for your kind words and support. I appreciate the clarity. I wanted to take a moment to address a few things: \n\nSome of you were confused about me comforting Sarah by saying I\u2019m due the week after the wedding. Yes, I am aware that the baby is literally due any day now and Sarah was rightfully worried about me going into labor at her wedding. I understand that makes me look naive, but she was so upset that I felt I had to comfort her.\n\nI was also at the character limit and in editing it down I think so things got lost in translation. The initial conversation where I told her I was not going to go into labor at her wedding happened when I had just learned my pregnancy would stick so I was very optimistic and very fresh in my pregnancy and only sharing the news with a select few people. Obviously a baby is going to come when they want. I was just trying to talk down a crying friend.\n\nSecond, I\u2019m not sure why I didn\u2019t think about stepping down as MOH. It\u2019s not that it didn\u2019t cross my mind, my husband has been panicking and has had very little patience with the whole ordeal, but it didn\u2019t feel like a possibility. Sarah has consistently said things like, \u201cdon\u2019t leave me\u201d \u201cyou have to be there\u201d \u201cplease don\u2019t miss my big day\u201d that it just didn\u2019t seem possible.\n\nThird, hearing everyone out has really made me reconsider this friendship. Sarah and I have been friends since highschool so it almost feels like we\u2019re sisters at this point. I know I\u2019m an AH for not listening to my husband about his concerns about Sarah, especially lately, I just chalked this behavior up to Sarah being Sarah. She\u2019s always been particular about events, and she and I have similar family dynamics so I empathized with her dealing with some of the pushback from her family. I just didn\u2019t realize things were as bad as they were.\n\nThank you again for your kindness and support. I appreciate it tremendously.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1678646416.0},{"title":"AITA for not wanting to be driven around by women including my gf","author":"aitagfnotdriving","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/11puelr\/aita_for_not_wanting_to_be_driven_around_by_women\/","text":"When I (27M) was a kid, I had a traumatic experience and was in an accident in the school bus which was being driven by a lady.

Still, I can't change the past, and now she's got a diagnosis. \n\nHer mother sent her to a psychiatrist who gave her the diagnosis but she's refusing to see him anymore because she said that he scared her. That's fine with me. I can't maker her see him. But I was very clear with her that it's up to her to manage herself if she keeps refusing help. \n\nSince starting high school her insistence on the number 3 has gotten worse, but she's still refusing to do anything about it. Her mother and I are divorced and share custody so I don't fully know what's going on at her house, but when she's at mine she can't even walk through a door without counting her steps and tapping the door 3 times. My younger sister (30f) lives with me and has seen my daughter displaying this behavior, and she's frequently told me, after my daughter's gone to bed, that she thinks I'm a bad father for raising a \"neurotic, out-of-control child\" (her words, not mine). \n\nSo after a few days of this I pulled my daughter aside and told her that she's being weird and needs to get her behavior under control. I told her quite simply that it's her prerogative if she thinks she can manage herself better than a doctor can but, in that case, she had better actually manage herself. I'm not going to be scorned for bad parenting when I've offered my daughter help. \n\nMy daughter started crying and refused to talk to me for a few days. Now she's back at her mother's house and her mother called me an asshole for calling my daughter weird. I don't think I am.

Once he had his own kids he made sure to let my fiance know that he was worthless in comparison to his own kids.

Their relationship is not good and it's all his step father's fault, he never tried to be a parent for him and hated having to keep him in the house (my fiance's grandmother told me this). When he was a teen everything was an issue, from his hobbies to friends, anything he did was wrong. \n\nWell anyway he's in college now and is studying to be a programmer. He's doing great.

He arrived just a little before lunch was served. \n\nAfter eating we were hanging out in the living room when fiance's mom asked him about college. He started talking about his grades, his classes and other school related stuff. His step father asked his sister who's a senior in high school if she had been studying. She said she did and he said great because she needs to be ahead foe next year. He then explained that his daughter was getting ready because she'll go into law school next year (he's a lawyer too) and then he said the comment that made me snap. He told my fiance that law school was hard and been good at it is something to brag about because everyone can play videogames all day but not everyone can graduate from a serious career (he literally said this). I looked over at my fiance and he was sad, he didn't said anything but I know him. So I snapped. I told him that if he thought that studying programming was playing videogames all day then he was far more ignorant that I thought he was. I originally planned to stop it there but then I got caught up in the moment and also told him that he was an asshole for dragging my fiance down on purpose. I also told him that he must have a miserable life if he's so focused on causing pain on others. Nobody said anything and my fiance asked me to leave so we did. \n\nHe's not angry at me, quite the opposite, he thanked me for standing up for him. I made sure that he knows I support and love him. \n\nHowever he got a message later from his mother about how rude I was for disrespecting his step dad and how I ruined the day.

From the moment my mother found out my fianc\u00e9 and I were having a baby she wanted to be very involved. Before we found out the gender my fianc\u00e9 and I already planned and came up with the name of our child. We picked out a boy name and a girl name respectively. Both names were rejected by my mom, dad and aunt. My parents wanted to name our baby. They said that this is their first grandchild and should have the right to name it. For days we were pressured into changing the names that we decided on to the names my parents wanted. I finally put my foot down and said no. This is our child and we will name it whatever we decide to name the baby. About a month passed and we found out that our baby is going to be a girl. For privacy sake let\u2019s call her Jessica. Jessica was the name that my fianc\u00e9 and I decided to go with because it just felt right. However my parents insisted on calling her Jasmine because it\u2019s stuck in their heads. Every time they call her Jasmine I repeat here name is Jessica. This was an everyday occurrence up until the day my baby girl was born. Now that she is born and on her signed birth certificate it says Jessica there is nothing my parents can do. However they still call her Jasmine. I\u2019ve recently gotten into an argument with my mother over it. She said that yes her legal name is Jessica but I will call her Jasmine because that\u2019s the name that is stuck in my head. I told her no her name is Jessica, you cannot call her a name that is not the one we gave her. I explained to her that she can call her any nickname or pet name she likes. But she will not disrespect me as the father of my child by calling her the name that SHE wants and not the name I have given my child.

They asked if I would like to go to their wedding that would happen this year.\n\nThey said the formal invitations would come on the physical mail, but they sent to everyone invited an email with the details and the wedding gift list. I payed for an upgrade on their honeymoon.\n\nIn this email I could see who was invited because of the addresses being visible, so I skimmed through the names to see who was going and who I could sit with - and one of them was a couple I also knew from HS. I sent them a message to mention I would also be at the wedding and would look forward to see them and we started to catch up.\n\nThe problem came when the physical wedding invitations came just 2 weeks before the actual wedding. It was stated that people with disabilities would have a hard time attending the wedding because of the location. It is an outside wedding and the place where it's happening can't make accommodations.\n\nI honestly got very mad. If someone who had a disability had planned to go they had a 2 week notice to cancel their plans. But then I thought it made no sense for them to directly invite someone with a disability then uninvite them with the invite, so the real reason was something else.\n\nThat couple I mentioned from HS had a kid very early on who is now 6, and she happens to have a disability. To me that was a message to the couple not to bring the kid.\n\nThe thing is, despite them not knowing about it, I am autistic. And where I am from, autism is a form of disability.\n\nI felt really sorry for the kid's couple because that's just a shitty thing to do. Also I thought the wedding couple was pretty dumb because I don't even think the kid couple was planning on taking their daughter. So I sent them a message saying I wouldn't be able to sit with them because I am disabled and was uninvited, and they said well, we are not coming anymore either.\n\nSo 5 days before the wedding I canceled my gift.\n\nSo now it's 8 days AFTER the wedding and I get a text message from the couple asking why I canceled my gift and expecting me to pay them money. They got to their honeymoon, thought they were under the upgraded package I previously payed for and used a lot of perks. So the bill came and it's a lot higher than they expected. So I just said guys you uninvited me to your wedding and I'm not paying for anything. After that they posted the story on social media saying I am the one being rude since they didn't know they were uninviting me, and I should have known better since the uninvite was for someone else. People are in general at taking their side.\n\nI didn't think I was being the asshole, but by the sheer number of people agreeing with them I could be. There is a lot of social situations I just don't get because of the spectrum thing, so just fire away if I am being a horrible person or if this is a \"gray area\". So, AITA?\n\nEDIT\/ Just to make it clear: I knew I wasn't uninvited. The reason I cancelled going was because I was standing up to a community I am a part of - if they had stated on the initial invite through the email that the place was hard to be accessible, I wouldn't have done this. But they waited until they sent the physical invitations on a two week notice. That was, to me, incredibly disrespectful towards disabled people.\n\nSECOND EDIT\/ I am going to sleep and this is getting a little more attention than I expected. I think from what I gathered I am either TA or ESH, which just basically says I did act assholery. Thank you for all the inputs and suggestions on what I could have done differently! Next time I will make sure to behave better.","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1678668220.0},{"title":"AITA for excluding my step son?","author":"FickleInfluence7076","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/11pt7g0\/aita_for_excluding_my_step_son\/","text":"*Sorry for mistakes. Am on mobile*\n\nI have one step son \"Jerry\" (17M) and 4 kids. \"Mark\" is from a previous relationship and the younger 3 \"Jess\" \"Rick\" and \"Susan\" are with my husband. So Jerry has one step sibling Mark and 3 half siblings Jess, Rick and Susan.\n\nJerry's parents were never together (summer fling), and I met his dad when he was 8. His mom has been a very lovely co-parent and there has been no alienation from her side. Despite that Jerry has always been very resistant to our family.\n\nI suspect he was very possessive of his dad and viewed me as an intruder. Whereas his mom got married when he was 2 so he was used to her being married. \nTrouble is he never got around to changing his mind. He never accepted me or his siblings. This caused a lot of issues as my kids would beg me to make Jerry hang out with them.\n\nI always refused. I told them you can't force feelings and while we can do our best to invite Jerry we can't force him to join us and be a part of our family. Rejection is a part of life. This was very hard for them to understand, it led to a lot of self esteem issues for them.\n\nJerry was very vocal in his distain for our family, he always declared his friends his \"siblings\" and would rub it in the kids faces. It verged on bullying. I told Jerry that family was important but didn\u2019t force him to do anything. The kids got to a point where they stopped reaching out to him and just formed their own sibling group.\n\nThe issue is Jerry's \"chosen siblings\" have ditched him. I don't know why, I think they just grew apart. Now Jerry's on his own and has been reaching out to his siblings. They want nothing to do with him. Recently there was an event and the kids wanted to go so I bought them tickets. When Jerry found out he asked for a ticket and said he wanted to go too but the kids said no. I asked them if they would reconsider but they were firm. Jerry hurt them a lot and they're not open to him.\n\nI told Jerry that I couldn't force them to take him the same way I didn't force Jerry go take his siblings. I want for them to get along but I also don't want to go against their wishes.\n\nNow I'm getting hate for excluding him by Jerry and his grandparents. AITA? What do I do?\n\nEdit: Husband doesn't know what to do either. Also Jerry isn't excluded from the family. I always have and still always invite him to any family thing we do. He is simply choosing to attend now. The kids now that he will always be invited to family events. But this wasn't a family event. This was a hang out they wanted to do by themselves.\n\nEdit 2: Logging off. No useful advice and filled with people writing me off as the evil step mom to even read what I write. Fine, live your Cinderella moment. You're such hypocrites. If Jerry was here saying \"step mom is forcing me to hang out with stepsiblings\" you would be cursing my name.","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1678663085.0},{"title":"AITA for \u201cbeing insane\u201d about finances?","author":"AITA_1-2-3-4","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/11pssga\/aita_for_being_insane_about_finances\/","text":"My husband has always controlled our finances as he tends to be more math brained.

He has always been very reasonable and has structured it to where we each pay a percentage of our paycheck to a shared account for bills and the rest goes to our individual accounts.  However, recently we have been having some marital problems with the very real possibility of divorce on the table.  We are trying to make things work, but the possibility has really made me think a lot about finances and the future.\n\nSince he has started a new job and his pay has changed, the overall amounts put in would need to be shifted anyway.  So I mentioned to him today that since we would be making some adjustments anyway, I\u2019d like to sit down with him and look over all the finances together to see what adjustments we can make to help make some smart investments for the future.  He replied that he had \u201calready made a spreadsheet\u201d and that I \u201cwould owe more and when (he) finished it, (he) would let me know what (I) owe\u201d.  I didn\u2019t appreciate this response very much as it came off to me as if I wasn\u2019t part of the the process, that he would make all the decisions and I would basically just pay whatever he told me.  So I again said \u201cI would like to sit down and go through everything together and make a plan together\u201d.  To which he responded \u201cno, I don\u2019t want to go through it together.  You can see my spreadsheet when it\u2019s done.\u201d  \n\nAt this point I\u2019m getting upset, and so I again say that this is a partnership and I want to do this together.

I said, \u201cif it\u2019s a one person job, why don\u2019t I make the spreadsheet\u201d? He then states he \u201cdoesn\u2019t trust me to make the spreadsheet\u201d and \u201cdo you even know how to make a spreadsheet?\u201d  This is deeply insulting as I have a Master\u2019s degree and many years of advanced math.  (I actually have a higher degree than he does, but obviously didn\u2019t point that out as that is a jerk move.) Then he says that I can \u201cgo ahead and make (my) own spreadsheet, but that (he) won\u2019t give me any of the info\u201d so I can make it.  So withholding info about our joint bills from me.  So I am pretty upset at this point and getting loud and upset saying that this is a partnership and that I want to be involved.  He gets angry in response and uses profanity in front of our young children as well as starts disparaging me in front of them, calling me \u201cinsane\u201d and telling me I\u2019m \u201cbeing nuts\u201d.

He got a room with a private bathroom whereas I need to share mine with 4 others. His kitchen is shared by 8 people just like mine but is also a lot bigger so we spend most of our time in his room. This is completely allowed btw as many students live with more roommates to save money. Since we are at the university all day, we only use the kitchen to cook dinner every night and on weekends. We even eat our food in his room so in total we spend like 60 min in the kitchen per day during non-quiet hours. His next door roommate (20sF) is home all day as she writes her thesis from her room. Her room is also right next to the kitchen so I guess she can hear everything more clearly than us.  She has asked my bf to walk quietly when in the kitchen and has also asked her bf to tell him.

I specifically chose a place with a pool for this reason. We all wanted to swim. That was literally the only key element I searched for and outright refused to settle for a place without a pool regardless of how nice it was. I paid $3600 for 2 weeks at a place with a private pool. \n\nThe first 3 days the pool worked great. The 4th day the pool pump stopped working and it was filthy within a matter of 14 hours. I mean, algae growing and extreme pollen to a point of pure green muck and not being able to see the bottom of the pool type of filth. I called the air bnb assistance hotline and they said they would send someone right out. It's going on day 3 now with no pool. I've called every day. They always keep saying the same thing.. \"Omg I'm so sorry, no one has called you yet?\" Or \"No one has showed up yet?\" Or \"I'm sorry ma'am, there's only so much we can do.\" I told them if it wasn't fixed by 8pm tonight that I would expect at least half of my money returned to me and they stated they would contact the owner.\n\nWell, the pool still isn't fixed. No one has called. In fact, the last time I called, they hung up on me. So I requested the partial refund and reported it to air bNb themselves. Instead of giving half the refund, they gave the full amount back. The owner called me directly from a private number flipping out, stating I'm taking food out of his children's mouths because apparently their only income is this air bNb. I told them that's absolutely not my problem and they should make sure their stuff is up to date and working, or at least be on top of it. I'm seeing this as a false advertisement because I paid for a pool and we no longer have a pool. Anyways, he told me I'm completely inconsiderate.

Our college is set up a little bit differently than most peoples, particularly the dorms, which, instead of being your typical dorm, are actually an old apartment complex that the school bought out and renovated. Usually, there are about three rooms, some of which are shared, a shared living room, a shared bathroom, and shared kitchen. \n\nWe also have a large pantry in the refrigerator, a roommate agreement is Made by all occupants in a particular unit at the beginning of the year about who\u2019s food goes where. The way we did it is that since there were three of us we each got a shelf in the refrigerator and a shelf in the pantry. The remaining shelf was used for items that were bought for everybody.\n\nHere is where the problem lies. We have ants. The ants have already ruined most of the food in the pantry. I found a bunch in a loaf of bread that I bought. Because I didn\u2019t want them contaminating anything else, when I went and bought new cereal and bread for myself, I put them on my shelf in the refrigerator. I know it\u2019s creepy, autistic and really unconventional but that\u2019s what my mom did when we had ants in our house when I was younger And it worked.\n\nNext thing, I know, I have to deal with my roommate, complaining about me, putting the bread and cereal in the refrigerator. I asked her why it even matters because it\u2019s on my shelf, it\u2019s my stuff, and she\u2019s not gonna eat it. My roommate is very particular about the way she wants things it\u2019s part of whatever condition she has. And if she doesn\u2019t get things exactly the way that she wants then she gets snippy with everybody else, and talks shit about us behind our backs. Which is exactly what she did to me.\n\nI ended up getting taken to the guidance counselor\u2019s office because she had made a complaint about what I had done with my food. She was in there having a whole ass meltdown, saying that it was weird and fucked up and that Non-refrigeratable food did not go in that area. I explained to them the ant problem, and they told me that because my with doing things was causing her sensory distress that I had to be transferred to another dorm.\n\nI think I might be the asshole, because admittedly, storing those things in refrigerator is abnormal. and I was also being disrespectful of her sensory issues, even though I don\u2019t understand them. It\u2019s also the fact that I realize in retrospect, maybe I could\u2019ve bought some Tupperware containers and put everything in that But for some reason it didn\u2019t occur to me at the time.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1678628390.0},{"title":"AITA for naming my daughter the name my brother wanted","author":"RichWeekend1564","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/11pvv5j\/aita_for_naming_my_daughter_the_name_my_brother\/","text":"Last summer my (22F) whole family who lives across the state came to visit me.

She went through chemo, radiation therapy, several surgeries. Especially when she had chemo, she\u2018d always lay in her bad or on the couch half passed-out because obviously chemo can make you feel quite shitty. As you can guess, it was a tough time for me. Not only the fact that obviously I was in fear because she had cancer but also the fact that I constantly saw her in such a bad state of health. I was alone a lot during that time and learnt to be independent. I felt lonely, scared und just wasn\u2018t in a good place mentally. She was diagnosed a month or so before my birthday and had to go to hospital for surgery on the day of my birthday. The treatment went on for about 2 years. \n\nNow, luckily my mother is better now. It\u2018s been 7ish years since she was diagnosed. However, I still have this weird thing about her taking a nap. It brings me back to when she was in her bed or the couch half unconscious back when she had chemo. I won\u2018t tell her not to nap, obviously. So whenever she takes a nap, which is only like once a month or so, I will leave the house and go for a walk or something because it helps me relax. This however means, that my brother will have to answer the phone (mom is asleep, I\u2019m not home) which he hates. So he told me I\u2018m an AH for always leaving when my mom is asleep because that means he will have to pick up phone calls. I said I was sorry but I needed this time for myself and if he hated answering the phone so much, he could always just not answer it and we\u2018ll call the person back later.

I told that if not, i would be able to bring my lunch and eat amongst everyone without any problem. It\u2019s something I do sometimes at big family gathering, because I don't expect everyone to be extra careful everytime for me. Vic told me that everything should be fine. 4 days before de the wedding, I texted again to be sure, and she said that the menu does not contain any of my allergens.\n\nWedding day; on the family brunch, I started to feel bad in my tummy. I privately asked to the chef if anything contained any nut\/coconut and hold and behold: the sauce for the egg contained coconut. I excused myself and went back home (20 minutes away from the venue). After this\u2026 well you can imagine the toilet became my best friend. I passed the next 5 hours on the toilet. I texted my brother to excuse myself, that i won\u2019t be able to come to the ceremony and i would try to come to the celebration.\n\nSo around 8 hours after the brunch, I was capable to go back to the celebration. I did my wedding toast to my brother and after, Vic came to me and ask why I was absent from the ceremony. I told her that the brunch did contain coconut and I passed the whole day on the toilet, that i\u2019m glad i was able to come back to the ceremony and did not needed to go to the hospital.

You can probably tell that the aim for my case with the social workers is re-unification. \n\nMy parents are getting better and family therapy has been helping a lot, but there are a few things that they won't accept. For example, they refuse to accept that they favoured my brothers over me and that they were better parents to them than to me.

I then decided that I didn't want to meet my parents on Saturday which worked out as one of my friends, Ray 17M, invited me to go watch a movie. I told my parents that I couldn't see them because I was busy but I told my social worker the truth and she understood.\n\nWhen I got back from the movie, my dad called me and told me that his brother had seen me at the cinema with my friend and he asked why I couldn't meet them. I told him that I was still upset after the therapy and he accused me of not trying hard enough to improve our relationship so I could move back in.

Our parents aren't financially stable enough to care for her, and since our father is disabled and unable to take much of a role in caring for her at all, they decided it was best for her to live with me and my fianc\u00e9. She knows about this and has never asked to live with her actual parents or to spend more time with them.\n\nWe live far from my parents, and since A has school here she can't spend much time with them. She only gets to see them on breaks or occasionally on weekends. A doesn't have a very strong bond with our parents. She sees me and my fianc\u00e9 as her parents instead, which I have no issue with since we basically are. However, she's recently started calling us her mom and dad. I stopped bugging her about it, and my fianc\u00e9 has too, so she just calls us her parents now.

A called me dad while telling a story, and my father was infuriated, and started yelling and asking A if he wasn't a good enough father for her, if she'd rather just be my kid instead, etc (My father has a horrible temper, and all throughout my childhood had a tendency to get angry over small things and have screaming fits during which he'll hit and throw things. It was one of the reasons we decided A would be best off living with me, but we were told he was better about it now). Normally I don't provoke him, but I refused to let A be yelled at like that, especially after I had to deal with it my whole childhood. I screamed that A had every right to see me as her father, after he had basically abandoned her with me. I had raised her and cared her since she was six, and he'd barely been present the entire time. He hadn't been a father to her for eight years, and I had been the one taking the role that entire time. Him and I ended up in a back-and-forth yelling argument.

In the class is another student \"Lillian\" (18f) who claims to have an anxiety disorder. I say \"claims\" because she only advertised her anxiety after we finished our unit on psychiatric disorders. She has said that she's never gotten a formal diagnosis. She says that learning about anxiety in class has helped her identify that she's been suffering from anxiety starting this year. She'll interrupt Mr. B to talk about her own \"experiences with anxiety disorders\" even though she never specifies what anxiety disorder she claims to have (and most of her examples are pretty typical experiences like feeling nervous before speaking in front of the class, even though this nervousness has never hindered her participation).\n\nWell, Mr. B assigned us a three-week long project to do in groups and he paired me with Lillian. It wasn't a terribly intense project and we agreed to split the work. I all got my part done about halfway through the second week. \n\nOur class meets every day of the school week, so, every day, I would talk with Lillian, who said that she would finish her work but her anxiety was really bothering her so she didn't want me to rush her. At the beginning of the third week she even told me to stop bothering her about the project because I was just making her anxiety worse, so I stopped questioning her.\n\nBy the day before the due date, Lillian hadn't done her part. Because we were being graded as a group, Lillian's slacking off would penalize me. I stayed after class and explained the situation to Mr. B and he told me that he trusts my work and he'll just grade Lillian and I separately. \n\nThe day that the project was due, Lillian still hadn't done her part. Lillian later asked me if I had put her name on my work and I lied and told her yes because I didn't want to deal with her. By the end of the week, Mr. B returned the projects and Lillian saw that I had submitted my work alone and that she had gotten a zero. She started crying and told me that I was cruel for lying to her and that her parents are going to be angry at her for getting a zero and that's going to make her anxiety worse. I told her that I really didn't care. \n\nImmediately after I said that I felt kind of badly because I don't know her home situation, but also I feel like her anxiety is really not my responsibility. After that she started crying harder and accused me of using Mr. B's favoritism to my advantage (because he has me for homeroom as well). Now she's spreading rumors that I'm his favorite, that I'm manipulating him, blah blah blah. Most of my grade doesn't care but Lillian's friends say that I'm invalidating her anxiety, that I'm privileged and wouldn't understand her struggles, and that it'll be my fault if she does anything to harm herself.

I get on great with everyone, that has never been an issue. \n\nLast week my SIL invited us both round for dinner, as J\u2019s Mother was staying with us for the week (she lives out of town).

Everything was going well until near the end of dinner, when I realised breast milk had leaked through my shirt. I honestly had nothing left in me after this, and just wanted to go home. My SIL said she understood completely (she\u2019s so supportive LOVE her), and had no problem with it.

I was already irate at this point, but my wife was able to deflect the conversation.\n\nOver the course of the night, they continued to make negative remarks that were directed at my mom. Even when my MIL was congratulating my sister about getting into law school, she used it to backhand my mom by saying how impressive it was considering where she came from.

It's a nice, two bedroom flat in Central London, with rent I could stretch to afford by myself on my salary.\n\nSince my sister doesn't earn enough to cover the whole rent, she pays a set amount and I cover the rest of her third.

It's a situation we're both very happy with.\n\nWhen my boyfriend moved in, we talked about rent and it made sense to split it three ways. He never asked how my sister could pay it.

This is because 1)I\u2019m a better cook and 2)he pays most of the bills so it evens out. My husband (24M) is also very active and counts calories and all that jazz. Because if this, I\u2019ve changed (for the better) a lot about my eating habits to cater to him. I was (and am) okay with this because I wanted to get healthier and he gave me the push I needed. However there are other changes I\u2019ve made for his benefit even though I really didn\u2019t want too. Specifically about what and how I cook, which is what this issue is about. \n\nThe Problem: I\u2019m southern and grew up eating and cooking soul food. It\u2019s not the healthiest so when he asked me to cut back, I did. Then he asked me to start using exclusively unsalted butter, I did that too. Then he asked me to stop butter said butter into vegetables, rice, gravy, and anything else I\u2019d normally put butter in, I cut back on that (I\u2019ll still put it in veggies about once a month or so). Then he asked me to stop mixing the sauce and the noodles together so make it easier to weight his food, I did that. He asked me to cut back on the amount of red meat I cook to once a week (twice at most), I did that. \n\nNow he\u2019s asking me to keep everything separate when I make pasta. The noodles, the sauce, and the meat all in separate pots.  To be fair, he\u2019s asked me to do it before. I tried for about a month and it genuinely irritated me to do that because the ratio is off. It just doesn\u2019t taste the same, so I stopped. Now he\u2019s asking me again and I tried to explain to him I hate doing it and really don\u2019t want to. I gave him the reason above but he just didn\u2019t understand. \n\nHe wouldn\u2019t budge so I said I\u2019d just split the meat and sauce in half and keep one half separate. He said that doesn\u2019t work because he still needs to take leftovers to work for lunch. He then offered a compromise of him being the one to make pasta and do it himself. I told him it defeats the whole purpose of not wanting to do it myself. At that point I knew there was no point in continuing the conversation so I just said \u201cwhatever, I\u2019ll do it how you want\u201d then left to our office. He came in a minute later and said to just mix it together and he\u2019ll deal, but was obviously irritated. \n\nSo AITA for not wanting to do it?\n\nEdit: People are asking id he compromises. He does. \nA few examples: \nI\u2019m lactose intolerant so we only buy lactose free milk (can\u2019t buy almond because he\u2019s allergic). Edit: i should probably expand more on this. We don\u2019t keep any lactose dairy products in the house unless there\u2019s no other suitable options. This includes things like creamer. He won\u2019t buy it, even if it\u2019s for him, because there\u2019s a chance that I might want to try it. \n\nHe likes a tidy house while I don\u2019t mind a little clutter, so he doesn\u2019t push the issue and lets me clean on my own time.\n\nI often forget about things he\u2019s asked me to do (ADHD) so he patiently reminds me.\n\nThose are just a few examples.\n\nEdit 2: he does cook 2 days out of the week. So it\u2019s not like I\u2019m doing all of it.","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1678677145.0},{"title":"AITA for telling my wife that her brother's mental meltdowns are a choice?","author":"Correct_Win_4491","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/11oz958\/aita_for_telling_my_wife_that_her_brothers_mental\/","text":"For as long as I've known my wife, her brother (we'll call him Frank) has had mental health and substance abuse issues.  He used to go out late at night with his friends, get hardly any sleep, and would randomly have mental breakdowns, which landed him in a mental hospital at least once, and has led to him getting fired from more than one job.  Finally, about a year ago, Frank got the help he needed and appeared to be doing better.  He got a bipolar diagnosis and was prescribed medication.  When he was on his medicine, Frank could function and even hold down a job.  Problem is, he would stop taking his medicine.  He would also drink\/smoke heavily, both on and off his medication, which obviously didn't help matters.\n\nFast forward to a few days ago, and we'd gotten word that Frank may be about to have another meltdown.  My wife seemed upset, but I told her that it's his choice to stop taking the medication, and he knows that he needs to stay off alcohol and other substances, yet he refuses to do so.  Personally, I don't drink excessively or use drugs, and I think it shows a lack of character to do so.  Frank still lives with my MIL at the moment, and she allows him to get away with horrible behavior.  He doesn't clean his room or the bathroom, is disrespectful, makes noise late at night, etc.  I told my wife that the best thing her mom could do for him would be to kick Frank out, so that he is forced to take responsibility for himself, for once in his life.\n\nMy wife told me that I was being cruel and that her brother would end up homeless if he couldn't live with my MIL.  I told her that her mother is being weak and doesn't want to be a parent, and that if we ever had a child like that, he would be out of our house as soon as he failed out of college (which Frank also did).  My wife told me that I was being unfair, and that Frank's illness means that he's going to have to live with her mother for the rest of his life, but I tried to calmly explain to my wife that I know people with bipolar disorder who can live independently, and that she is simply making excuses for her screw-up of a brother.\n\nAnyway, after I made that remark, my wife slammed the door of the bedroom shut and didn't come out for several hours.  She has also rejected any attempts that I've made to speak with her about the situation.  I believe that she is in denial, cannot come to grips with her brother's moral failings, and has instead decided to blame me.

My phone charger was also not in it\u2019s usual place. I asked H if he knows if anyone had slept in the bed while we were gone and he replied no. I asked him to confirm this with his mum because if someone had, I did not want to sleep in the same sheets they had slept in (I should add here that I am completely against sharing a pillow and because of how sensitive my skin is, I would break out if I shared a pillow with someone). \n\nAnyway, H asked his younger sister first (the SIL who also lives in the same house) if anyone had slept in our bed.

We all had 3 months to plan ahead. \n\nFor context, my friend's boyfriend and I have asthma. My asthma is so severe that I have disabled parking and an SDiT. I don't know how severe his is, but I feel it's relevant to add that he smokes weed, cigarettes, and vapes.\n\nAlmost every time we all hang out, he asks to use my inhalers and I give them to him without a second thought. \n\nBefore we left for the trip, I let my friend know that I didn't have the means to be sharing my inhalers with him. \n\nAs you've probably already guessed, he asked to use one of my inhalers on the last day of the trip. I gave him one of them to use and thought nothing of it until last night (3 weeks later). \n\nSo, my friend comes to me and says that as her friend, I could have at least given him a few puffs off my inhaler. \n\nI told her that she was coming across as selfish for being upset with me over the inhalers that I rely on and pay for, and I didn't understand how she had any place to be upset when I literally shared my inhaler when he asked. \n\nShe said that the inhaler that I shared with him wasn't my rescue inhaler and therefore didn't help him and she had to \"watch him suffer\" on the way home because of it. \n\nAsthma medicine shortage aside, I really just don't understand how I was wrong for being concerned about my health, too. I love her and we've been friends for a long time, but I just don't see how I was wrong for giving him one inhaler over the other when he didn't even bother to specify which one he wanted. \n\nSo...\nAm I the asshole for not giving him my rescue inhaler?\n\nEDIT** I really appreciate everyone's responses! Thank you, I feel a lot better about defending myself during this disagreement. \n\nA couple of things to add: \n\nI know it's not sanitary, I disinfect the inhalers every time they get used. \n\nI know you're not supposed to share prescriptions, it's just not easy to tell someone \"hey I know you can't breathe that great but I can't give you something that may or may not help you\"  \n\nThey've been together for around 3 years and they have kids together. \n\nI made sure to establish that I will not be sharing my inhalers with him, or anyone else, ever again.\n\nFINAL EDIT: \nI want to thank you all for your responses, whether you determined that I was the asshole or not. \n\nI haven't yet, but I will be establishing that our friendship is either done or on a break till they learn to appreciate the things I do for them, including but not limited to putting their health over mine. \n\nThere's been a few people who wondered why I gave him the steroid inhaler over the rescue, even though he never specified. Since this was a while ago, I don't fully remember the details but I think it was in the morning and I am NOT a morning person. I also have ADHD so my daily is next to me at night so I remember to take it in the morning. It was the inhaler that was closest to me and I wasn't in the mood to put forth the effort to get my rescue inhaler out of my purse\/duffel\/makeup bag, whatever it was in. \n\nMaybe I was being subconsciously passive-aggressive, I understand that now. Maybe everyone's the asshole in this situation, but my conclusion is this: \n\nIt's just as much my responsibility to take care of my health as it is his responsibility to take care of his. I would never just let my friend die, but I can do that without putting my life at risk too. \n\nThank you all, you've been a great help!","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1678557478.0},{"title":"AITA for telling my coworker she doesn\u2019t need to be adopted.","author":"user295207","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/11ooza4\/aita_for_telling_my_coworker_she_doesnt_need_to\/","text":"So my coworker (26f) lost her adoptive dad six years ago and live with her adoptive mom.

I message and call when I can, and always make sure to wish people happy birthday or to celebrate important events.\n\nIt's our tradition to open stockings on Christmas Eve, but Sam was in the middle of a game when we planned to start. Dad made him come out, but Sam was upset. He sat in a corner, pouting and being rude to everyone. Eventually Dad had enough of this, and angrily stopped setting up. He said he couldn't handle him right now, and stormed outside to calm down.\n\nSam instantly said he did nothing wrong, which was the last straw for Tina.

I also couldn't afford to get a gift because money is tight.

Tina kept telling me it was no big deal and to stop crying, but I couldn't help it. When Dad came back in I rapidly apologized and ran to my room. Dad and I eventually went for a walk to talk things out, and he told me Tina was sorry. We eventually celebrated the rest of our Christmas, but it all felt super uncomfortable.\n\nA few months later, I've begun to feel angry at Tina. If she had just told me about this after the first time I messaged late I could have done better next time, and this would've been resolved months ago. Instead, she held a grudge for nearly a year, dragged me into a fight I wasn't involved in, and made Christmas uncomfortable for everybody. Sam deserved to be told off, but this wasn't the time for Tina to bring up her other problems with us. She took a bad situation and made it 1000 times worse, and she never even apologized to me.\n\nThis is coming back up because, when I graduate in May, I'm moving back in for a few months before my master's program starts in another city.

We were very fortunate and got pregnant on the first try. As soon as we found out, positive test at 5 weeks, we shared on our family chat because we were very excited!  The family chat includes my dad, my brother (22M) and his wife (21F). My brother, who is on deployment,  sends me a lengthy message about how I'm selfish and rubbing it in their face that we are pregnant when we know they've struggled with fertility issues and it's something I should have kept to myself. I know his wife has issues with her reproductive organs that would make it VERY hard for her to conceive but neither of then shared that they were actively trying. I also understand how hard deployments can be, I'm a veteran and my husband is active duty, AND our mom died about 16 months ago, so I'm trying to be really understanding of their feelings and experiences. However, I'm really hurt. I don't think it's wrong to share our excitement. I want to share because if we were to have a miscarriage I would want my family to know and to help me through it. It just seems really out of character for my brother to treat me this way.  His wife hasn't said anything or acknowledged what we said.\n\nEDIT TO ADD\n\nI'd be happy to answer\/clarify a few things. \n\n1) They did not share they were trying to get pregnant\/recieve fertility treatments. She shared about a year prior that she will likely struggle to conceive but didn't want to go into detail. We respected her privacy and didn't pry. She is shy and very quiet. We all expressed support for her and whatever their journey looks like. \n\n2) I was concerned about miscarriages because I have uterine fibroids, very irregular periods, and I was SA by someone for an extended period of time, multiple times, while I was deployed and didn't have access to birth control. I did not become pregnant, which I am VERY GRATEFUL FOR, but my doctor and therapist both agreed that it could signal that I would face fertility issues. My mom isn't around so I can't get her medical history (which could affect me). The doctor told me that I would have to try for 12-18 months before getting a referral to a fertility clinic and that I should gather resources (such as therapy) and support (husband, friends, family if I'm comfortable with that) to help me through those potentially difficult times.  \n\n3) If I knew they were actively trying and struggling, I would have waited to tell by brother and SIL until he came home and had time to reintegrate but also checked out on my SIL frequently to see what I could do to help\/alleviate the stress.","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1678598501.0},{"title":"AITA for running a female-exclusive student seminar as a male?","author":"Throwaway80801742","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/11ptzlc\/aita_for_running_a_femaleexclusive_student\/","text":"I'm (26M) a math grad student. I'm in a somewhat odd situation where I can't seem to make women interested in being friends with me, but when it comes to teaching, I'm extremely popular among female students. So I've never had a GF and don't have any female friends (only acquaintances), but my classes are very popular among female students and all of my students that I tutored privately happened to be female.\n\nMy friend Ari (26M) is also a math grad student who also struggles with women. He started 5 years ago an informal student-led seminar for undergrads, where students can socialize and give lectures on any math topic they find interesting. I joined the seminar a few months later and we've been running it together ever since. Though for the past two years the number of meetings has been dwindling to an almost a complete halt. We both wanted to reboot the seminar again, but never found the right time. A couple of months ago, I finally decided to reboot the seminar, though now as a female-exclusive one. I had several reasons:\n\n1) We don't have any female-exclusive student seminar in our department.\n\n2) I could get many of my female students to participate in the seminar.\n\n3) This could be a good opportunity for us to socialize more with women.\n\nSo before I get roasted for reason #3, let me explain it a bit more. By socializing I don't mean preying on women or expecting any sort of relationship out of that, I will never date one of my students. What I mean is simply getting to know them better on a more personal level, and perhaps developing some platonic friendships.\n\nWhen I suggested this idea to Ari, he was disgusted by it and said that it isn't appropriate for two men to run a female-exclusive seminar, and that the whole socializing aspect sounds creepy. He told me to scrap this idea and help him reboot the seminar the way it was originally. I told him that I'm going to do it anyway and that he should either reboot his seminar alone or with someone else.\n\nSo far, I've managed to gather around 15 female students and we had 3 meetings, all of which were very successful and fun. Ari doesn't seem to want to reboot his seminar anymore and is still under the impression that this whole female-exclusive seminar is a way for me to get laid, no matter how much I explain to him that I would never date one of them. This hasn't affected our friendship too much though, he's just slightly disappointed by me.

To sum it up, he said he didn\u2019t want anyone who wasn\u2019t paying for anything I the house to be eating all the food in the house. To say I was speechless was an understatement.

So I scolded her, telling her to PLEASE not leave her dishes there, and clean them herself. \n\nShe yelled back, in an annoyed tone, something along the lines of \"not right now, I'm making myself lunch\". I got irritated because this ALWAYS happens. She always says \"not right now\" or \"I will later\" but she never fucking does. I then yelled at her something along the lines of \"me and [oldest sister] aren't going to clean your and [second oldest sister]'s dishes\". I was furious. \n\nShe scoffed and said \"I know\".

About a week after their wedding, my siblings snuck into my room in the middle of the night, sad about dad being married and the changes that had happened. They asked if I felt like mom really gone now and I said yeah. I asked them if they'd like for us to have something just for us, no new family involved, where we could remember mom and talk about that stuff. They said yes. So I raised the money to buy a pretty nice scrapbook and about once a month my siblings would sneak into my room at night and we'd put photos in and write memories we had and I'd share the stories I remembered of mom, since as the oldest I remembered her best and remembered the stories about her I'd heard. We never added Rose, our stepsister or our half siblings when they were born. We also didn't talk about it to dad or anyone else. I knew he wouldn't love that we were doing it. I kept it hidden in my room.\n\nThree weeks ago my Rose went through my stuff and found it. She claims she was cleaning up in my room but I know she was snooping because I had it hidden in a place that she wouldn't be cleaning. She went through it, showed my dad, and they sat my siblings and I down and told us that was a really unfair thing to have in the house and how mean it was to do something like that without all the siblings involved. My brother said it was just for the three of us as real siblings. Dad told him that was a shitty attitude and what are our stepsister and half siblings if not real siblings. My sister said it would always be different. Rose said we should never have made something in the home we all shared when it excluded three of our siblings and would hurt feelings. She said we should have done something to bring us all together. My sister said that wasn't what she wanted. My dad sent them out of the room and he and Rose told me I never should have gone along with it and how much it hurt my stepsister when she saw the book and heard what we'd been doing. Rose said it hurt her too. That she tried to make us all one family and we made sure never to close that divide in the last six years.

I always make sure she catches fish every time we go, but I just do my own thing.\n\nLately this has began to annoy her. It started with comments like, \"why do you always have to catch a fish before me?\" I started letting her have a little bit of time to catch one before I started casting. Today things blew up a little more though. I had one of the best days I have ever had and she was struggling. For most people she was having an amazing day. She caught ten fish. But I caught more and she was really mad at me and told me to leave and fish by myself or help her.\n\nI helped her out a little and went back to fishing. She caught a few more but was still pissed at me that I was catching more fish. It led to her not talking to me for the rest of the day and saying how annoying it was.

I am pretty much a homebody when I\u2019m not at work and I\u2019m pretty introverted (so is he) so this works well for both of us. \n\nIn the past few months, he started seeing someone and they\u2019ve been hanging out everyday. This has got to the point where it would be a bit annoying because sometimes I would just want to come home and not have to entertain his boyfriend. For context his boyfriend is a very outgoing person and likes to talk A LOT. I like him and think he\u2019s cool but sometimes I want to just go home and not speak to anyone. \n\nOur lease is up in soon so I got a second job to save up. This means I\u2019ve been working about 60-70 hours a week. This has been catching up to me as I am exhausted. I was super drained from the week and was looking forward to coming home and relaxing. I had just gotten home from work when my roommate (who had been on a week\u2019s vacation) had returned late at night, with his boyfriend in tow. \n\nI had my earbuds in and was watching a movie on my phone in the kitchen (which is right by the front door) so I said hello and didn\u2019t make conversation past that. His boyfriend asked me a question, something generic about my day and I just gave a very simple answer. \n\nAfter this point I went into my room because I was tired and wanted to be left alone. I didn\u2019t think anything of it until my roommate tells me the next day that he feels like I ignored him and the boyfriend and that I was being rude by not being more excited that he\u2019s back.

We are in a serious relationship and feel committed to each other despite not being married. Recently she questioned why people get married and was upset that society has made marriage into this checkbox to become a \u201clegitimate\u201d couple in the public eye. She wondered why people get married in the first place, if in an ideal world there would be nothing that changed before and after you get married and we both agreed that we would love each other the same. I told her I wanted to get married because I felt like I wanted to prove to myself and to her that I could be a good husband (and eventual father to our kids) despite that being something I didn\u2019t have as a child. She never said she didn\u2019t want to spend her life with me but she was unsure of succumbing to society\u2019s expectation of what a couple \u201cshould\u201d be by getting married.\n\nI am a medical student and will have a salary between 300-500K after finishing residency in 5-5 years and asked her how she would feel if we didn\u2019t have a joint back account then. She said that that would be different because that would be a power imbalance since I would have the ultimate decision on finances because she would be earning between 55-75K. I pushed back and said that I didn\u2019t see how that was any different than me trusting she wouldn\u2019t use our money on things we didn\u2019t agree. She got upset and asked how I didn\u2019t see that as a power imbalance and I responded by saying that I wouldn\u2019t magically wake up one day and have $300K in my bank account. I will have graduated with at least $200K in debt and while it will change our life completely, it would still take years of further sacrifice before we can actually feel a salary change. She didn\u2019t see it that way and stormed off. Just to be clear, I have full intention of marrying her and having a joint bank account but it did make me upset that she saw it as a \u201cpower imbalance\u201d when I would have to trust her to not buy things we don\u2019t agree just as much as she would have to trust me to make sure we use mostly my salary on things that we agree. How have other couples navigated these conversations before? Some physicians I\u2019ve met have warned me to get a prenup before getting married since nobody thinks of their finances after a divorce until they\u2019ve actually gone through one.\n\nEdit: she asked how can there not be a power imbalance for our children if we don\u2019t have a joint account. I told her that our children will never need anything in their lives with a salary like that and she would have to trust me to use most of my salary on them just like I trust her to not spend our money on things we didn\u2019t agree.\n\nEdit: in our 3 years of dating we have always split things 50\/50.

Until last month I had an internship at a hospital, where I worked for very little money. I bought myself some clothes and one of them was a sweater I waited for, because it was constantly sold out. It disappeared a while ago and at the time I didn\u2019t notice it.\n\nMy mother likes to wear my clothes a lot. So when I remembered it I just thought she must have worn it and it\u2019s just in a laundry basket. Last night, I was looking for something to wear and I asked my mom if she knew where it went.  \n\nShe said she didn\u2019t know what sweater I was talking about and said to look in her closet if she has something to wear. I found the bag with my Summer clothes in it and a white sleeve poking out of it.\nI pulled it out and it was exactly the sweater I was looking for.\n\nWhen I turned it around there was a huge hole burnt through the front of it with black smoke all around it. \nI saw that and I admit I got a little angry and she was on the phone at the time and maybe I could have done it later but I was just mad that she hid it and lied about it. \n\nAt first I asked her calmly about what it, but when she just laughed at me and belittled me to the person on the phone, I just blew up and yelled at her a little (which may have not been a great move).\nI told her I wanted a new one right now, even though she said to me she will do so tomorrow, but I knew she was lying. \nI insisted she do so right now and that I don\u2019t care who is on the phone right now, when she insisted that she is talking to somebody. \nIt wasn\u2019t my proudest moment but I got a little louder and told her she was a liar and I knew she wouldn\u2019t. \n\nMy brother got in and asked what happened, when I reiterated what happened he told me it was just a sweater and nothing important and I had no business getting angry at her. So I just stormed out of the room and told my dad what happened. He said that he understood and I should buy a new one and he will give me the money.\n\nWhen I went to my room, I heard him talking to her that it wasn\u2019t alright to do that, because I was working hard for the little money I got and she just disregarded that. So then she got mad and told him that she got nobody on her side and that we are all just trampling her because her dad died (February this year). \n\nAnd it made me even more mad, because she was using that, because she knew it was wrong. In this entire argument she never once said that she was sorry. I guess what made me so mad was also that I always gave her money for when she wanted to do her nails and hair, and when the car broke down, I gave her the money to fix it and because I gave her the money she needed see her father before he died, even though the half I gave her was almost my entire paycheck. \n\nWhen I talked to my cousin she said I had no right to be mad at her, because her dad died.

It\u2019s just a decision we have agreed upon together, because we hide our snacks from our kids. I simply choose to give in to my cravings occasionally. I typically regulate the cravings with exercise but AGAIN, sometimes I just cave in. He also has an endocrine disorder and I frequently wake up to him munching on something. I\u2019ve even woken up to food wrappers in my bed and all I say is, \u201ccan you please throw these away!\u201d It something I thought we had accepted with one another.\n\nSo at 5:30 this morning, he wakes up to my eating crackers, while sitting on the corner of my bed. He sleeps heavy, so I was shocked I woke him. He responded, \u201cWhy are you eating right now?\u201d I say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I haven\u2019t been able to sleep all night and now I\u2019m hungry.\u201d To which he says, \u201cfor someone who is concerned about their weight, this is the worse time to be eating.\u201d I have said minor comments in the past like \u201cThese pants make my butt look huge\u201d or \u201cmaybe this is not the most flattering shirt because you can see my stomach\u201d I don\u2019t think I\u2019m fat. I respond, \u201cstop picking on me (at this point I\u2019m agitated.) He says \u201c I\u2019m your husband and I\u2019m trying to help you, it\u2019s not healthy.\u201d I say, leave me alone and go back to sleep.\u201d He storms out of the room and insists I\u2019m being mean to him!\u201d All the while I\u2019m apologizing asking him not to leave.\n\nI can completely understand how the crunch noise could be annoying. However, it would have been nicer of him to just say \u201cplease go eat in the other room\u201d or try to be more quiet?\u201d So, AITA here for waking him up or is he the asshole by saying he\u2019s helping me?\u201d BtW I would have happily moved to the other room if he told me to please put those away or got eat somewhere else. I just feel like this is gaslighting. )Yes, I\u2019m also aware gaslighting is a pattern of abuse where someone uses manipulation to make another person question their reality, so I can see how the limited context I have given here can make it seem like I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about but there is a lot more to this, so I apologize if I have offended anyone.He\u2019s acting as though I have asked him the watch what I eat. I have never asked him to monitor what I eat. He is saying that I am saying and doing things I never did and then makes me feel bad because I\u2019m calling him out on that. He\u2019s using helping me in his defense to say rude shit when he\u2019s annoyed I\u2019ve never asked him to help me and he\u2019s acting as if I did. Look, I never claimed to be a mental health professional or downplay a form of abuse.\n\nNow that this post has had thousands of views. I\u2019d like to thank you all for your opinions. I can handle that people don\u2019t agree with me, feel I\u2019m annoying stupid, and just plain ignorant. What I can\u2019t wrap my head around is how many of you have seemed to gain so much pleasure by putting me down again and again. I know what this platform is and don\u2019t expect to be treated like a queen. However, I thought I\u2019d be treated like a human. An honest human because I\u2019m openly admitting a lot of my wrong doing. I just don\u2019t get it. Please think before you write. If you would still say that to my face in person, then, please absolutely, write how you feel. On the other side of this post I\u2019m real and many of you have treated me like such trash. To the point where you would think I said something awful to you or attacked you. So many people wonder what\u2019s wrong with our world, this is it.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1678538121.0},{"title":"WIBTA if I introduced myself to my step mom who I\u2019ve known for 20 years?","author":"isthatatortoise","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/11psraf\/wibta_if_i_introduced_myself_to_my_step_mom_who\/","text":" My dad and step mom have been separated for a year or two. They each brought 2 kids into the relationship, then had 1 kid together. I have known my step mom since I was 4, almost 20 years, her and her kids are family to me, and to the rest of my family. I spend a lot of time with dad and half brother, but am pretty much estranged from step mom and her kids. \n \n When they married, she took my dads last name, which is mine too, and even changed her kids last names to ours. I visited their home annually, and ended up living with them full time for a couple years. I was a troubled teen, so I did butt heads with her and get into trouble sometimes. I did start trying to mend things with her back then, but she never returned the effort, so now we have no relationship. \n\n A friend of mine recently got a job at the place my step mom works. Friend was not aware that she is my step mom, and asked her if we are related since we have the same last name. They told me step mom said \u201cNo, I don\u2019t know her. I think that\u2019s (my aunts name) niece.\u201d I\u2019m not sure why she disowned me. I knew she resented me for things I did when I was a kid, but I thought we were kind of on the same page at least. \n\n At first I thought it was pretty laughable that she would do that, except when I told my dad, it really hurt him. He still considers her kids as his kids, he helped raise them and is still there for them. Me and my whole family still recognize them as family, they\u2019re just separated now. We would never disown her or her kids. \n\n Next time I see her, (small town) I think I\u2019m just going to introduce myself as if she is some past acquaintance, and refer to her with her maiden name and not my dads last name. It does hurt me that she shares my family name but just pretends she doesn\u2019t know me, let alone helped raise me, for reasons unknown to me. I thought I would have a laugh about it, but the reactions from some of my friends and family have me second guessing if it is a mean thing to do.","upvote_ratio":0.71,"created_utc":1678662009.0},{"title":"AITA for breaking my agreement with my ex?","author":"Luckytownsend","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/11pzti6\/aita_for_breaking_my_agreement_with_my_ex\/","text":"AITA for breaking my agreement with my ex?\n\n\n\nWhen me and my ex split up, I didn't want him to pay child support as long as he maintain a relationship with her. I was better off financially than him. He moved across the country, so FaceTime and calls was all he could do.\nHe would never return her calls, which obviously upset her and I always had to make excuses for him.\nSo after 5 years I got tired of it and I told him that he either needed to put in an effort to support her emotionally or I would go after child support and he would support her financially.

He started gaslighting me, telling me he only came up here as a favor to me , and blamed me and my current husband for her not calling him ( she's 12) and the way she acts up. \nWe argued the entire 3 weeks he was here. He didn't take her on his last day here, I had to track him down to find out what was going on. I told him it was his last day here and she was really wanted to see him. If he wasn't going to take her, he should have at least let me know. I asked him if he  wanted to say goodbye to her before he left, she started crying and was asking\"but its your last day, why can't you take me?\"  They talked for a couple minutes and then hung up.

Ever since the split, I have never let anybody talk bad about him around her, because she doesn't need to hear the poor opinions that other people have. I want her to make her own opinion about him. Up until recently he has extended the same courtesy. But while he was here, he told her about arguing. He made it sound like I was mad that he was going out with his friends, rather than upset with him not spending time with her. \nShe does have a stepdad that has been with me since she was three and he adores her just as much as mine and his daughter.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678681060.0},{"title":"AITA for saying someone faked a pregnancy when they clearly did?","author":"duckieduckinnit","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/11pxu2n\/aita_for_saying_someone_faked_a_pregnancy_when\/","text":"Backstory to this.

My uncle felt bad and generously gave me his two year old American Staghound. He had originally bought the dog as an adult for hunting, but it didn\u2019t work out as the sweet boy is a sensitive soul and doesn\u2019t have a huge prey drive. He is very polite and quite. This worked out for all parties and my boy has easily transitioned into his new life as a full time couch potato and cuddle bug. When I got him, he was up to date on all vaccinations but was not neutered. I have not made neutering him a top priority because he is not aggressive and doesn\u2019t really have any behavioral problems. He does not hump, chews minimally (dude cannot stay out of the garbage while alone), and listens fairly well at home. I do plan on setting an appointment up soon for the procedure.\n\nI live in a city and have a small yard. My dog is very low energy but needs to go to the dog park at least once a week to run. He often goes multiple times. Today we went to the dog park. He was running with several other dogs (absolutely no issues, as he doesn\u2019t care to wrestle and just likes to be chased) when a woman came with her female dog. My dog went up to her dog, they sniffed one another, then ran off together. The lady appeared annoyed. She went after them and called for her dog. I called for mine and they kept running. I will fully admit that we need to work on recall when he is off leash in open areas. Both dogs continued to run around. My dog was clearly trying and succeeding to get her dog to chase him. \n\nAfter about 5 minutes, her dog ended up going to her and mine followed. I walked over while the dogs just stood next to her. She grabbed his collar and gave him to me. She seemed very irritated, so I apologized and she said, \u201cWhat a pest! You know what it is? It\u2019s his testicles. He\u2019s still intact. It\u2019s SO annoying when people bring unaltered dogs to the park.\u201d \n\nI was taken aback. He had only sniffed and ran around with her dog. He was not aggressive, did not jump, or even bark. I didn\u2019t say anything, hooked his leash back on, and went home.

We fight all the time, mostly over the condition of our hoarder house - there's so much clutter, and with the cats and dogs we have on top of it, it's honestly disgusting. The smell rubs off on your clothes and items, and  I ended up heavily bullied and ostracized as a result (not that I was very popular before, anyways.) It's been like that since I was thirteen, not long after my parents separated, and at some point I just... got used to it.My social life suffered. \n\nWe fought occasionally, then the pandemic happened, and I was stuck at home. I literally never had the chance to leave. She never wanted me to get a license or a job, because \"she could give me rides and being a student was my job.\" My grades slipped, we would fight about that and how I didn't get stuff done around the house, even though I was home all day. Like I didn't have anything else to do. \n\nIt only got worse over the years. Eventually we just started fighting all the time. She'd say I'm a selfish little bitch, that I was just like my dope head sister. That I thought I never did wrong, and I was always right, and I didn't appreciate anything she did for me, or gave up for me. The job I got after graduation was my only safehaven. Arguments only ended when I gave in and said she was right. An opinion is grounds for war and any emotion is an attitude. There are good times. She's not a bad person. I enjoy when we hang out. But the bad times are really bad. \n\nI was cleaning and she was doing nothing, so I got aggravated. I sat down for a second, and she started laying into me, saying all the usual stuff. Then said she wouldn't take me to work, so good luck getting a ride. So I left. I would never do that to her if she depended on me like that, so my feelings were hurt. I worked my shifts, went back two days later. We talked and things felt better. But it stayed tense, and eventually we fought again, and it wasn't getting better. So I called my GF to come get me so I could get ready for work, and told my Mom we both needed some time to cool down, because this wasn't getting anywhere.\n\nShe told me that running away never fixed anything and that I'm a quitter, I told her I wasn't running away, but that we both needed time.

The son (I\u2019ll call him Mike ) is 30 but has fallen on hard times and has no one in this area to help him so we said we\u2019d let him stay with us while he figures out his next move. Mike has been here two weeks and came with nothing and is not able to work because of issues I wont go into here.

My husband and use different soap as I have sensitive skin and have to use soap with light perfumes and no dyes. I typically use ivory soap or white dove bar soap,  my husband prefers Irish Springs which I cannot use. When Mike first came the only extra soap was Irish Springs so that is what I put in his bathroom and he had no issue with it. \n\nSince Mike has been here I have been buying things here and there and stocking the home with things he might need. I ask him what he wants but he is not really picky so I just grab things as I do the regular shop. A few days ago I bought myself bar soap as I was out and decided to get a large pack to split with Mike. I bought the Dove white bars. They do not have a particular scent, it\u2019s literally just soap. Not flowery or \u201cgirlie\u201d scented in any way. I left the soap in his bathroom and went about my day. \n\nThat night the soap I left him was stacked up on the kitchen island, so I asked if there was a problem with it. Mike laughed and said no but he\u2019s not a woman and doesn\u2019t use feminine products. I told him it\u2019s just plain old soap and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gendered, it can be used by anyone. He asked if my husband used it and I said no but only because he has a strong preference for Irish Spring. Mike said he doesn\u2019t like to be rude but he will not use girl soap. I said fine and I\u2019ll get him Irish Spring. \n\nI thought it was silly but let it go and was not too worried about it, however, Mike has brought it up a few times in the last few days and seems pretty offended that I would even think he\u2019d use girls soap.

BIL (32m) is in the military and has lived in VA for four years.  We (and the rest of his family) are in WI.  He had a very low key wedding in January, just them, an officiant and two witnesses.  I am generally of a mind that people are entitled to do whatever they need for their wedding and genuinely take no offense that no family was there.\n\nThe trouble is the reception.  His new ILs have decided to hold it in RI in June.  We learned about it this week.  They want his entire family to come out.  We would be covering all travel and lodging expenses for ourselves, which obviously is the norm.  \n\nUnfortunately, my husband had achilles tendon repair surgery one week ago.  He will be out of work for two months, then back on restricted duties after that until he is clear to perform his job duties of driving a truck and forklift.  He is getting 60% of his paycheck while out and he will get 75% of his paycheck while on restricted duties.  I am picking up the slack and covering expenses while he takes care of his primary bills (car loan, insurance and student loans).  We planned our budget meticulously and we can handle this.  The surgery is very needed to avoid future disability if the partially torn tendon had fully torn.  He only gets two weeks vacation per year at his job and it is all needed for PT as he recovers.\n\nWe can't afford to go.  It looks like the plane tickets would be around $350 each, then we have hotel and food...maybe car rental too?  I think even conservatively, we would need $1200.  We don't have it right now.\n\nHe explained that to BIL on the phone and he seemed understanding.  BIL is a good kid, very emotionally mature and chill.  Then yesterday, my husband got an hysterical guilt tripping rant from their mother because she found out we are not going.  Their mother is...a monster.  I am sorry but there is no other way to describe it.  My post history has stories.\n\nThe problem is she still got in my head.  It's his brother.  It's important.  I sent his BIL a long message with my sincere regrets and hoped he still planned on coming here later this year because we would love to meet his wife.  He read it but didn't answer.  We are also going to scrounge up whatever money we can to buy a nice gift to send out to them.\n\nI feel so guilty.

My view has always been quality over quantity, whether it be for myself or friends\/family. \n\nMy birthday was coming up and one of my friends asked me what I wanted since they couldn\u2019t think of what to get me. At that time, I hadn\u2019t purchased the blender I wanted so I thought, oh this would be great for them to get me since it was also on sale at the time. The response I got entailed of \u201c okay great , I got you, I\u2019ll get it for you and hopefully it comes before your birthday.\u201d I immediately thanked them and said I can\u2019t wait to use it. \n\nJust to give some slight detail of the item, the prince range anyway, it was around $180 and with the sale, it was looking closer to $110.\n\nAnyway, the package arrives early and I\u2019m quite excited to open it. I hadn\u2019t opened the box completely and I already knew I did not receive the one I wanted. It had an off brand name to which I was unfamiliar with and my face dropped. My friend had told me they were going to order the one I wanted and this was not it. I quickly googled the brand and the reviews that followed were not good. I rummaged through the box to find a gift receipt so I thought, okay at least I could return this and use the credit to get the one I wanted. \n\nWhen I started the return process\u2026 the gift receipt revealed the amount that was spent and I thought wow, what a cheapskate. It was about half of the price of the blender I wanted. I know it\u2019s better to give than receive, however this was almost unbelievable. We\u2019ve gone out to eat or done a group activity where I\u2019d sometimes pay for them without hesitation.\n\nAfter I did the return, I didn\u2019t mention what was done because I didn\u2019t think it was necessary and I did not want to pick a fight. A month after all of this, the same friend asked me how I liked it and I told her the truth. This was where the argument started. \n\nThey went on to say how it hurt their feelings and that I was being petty since it wasn\u2019t the brand I asked for. I explained I did a lot of research for that blender and was really looking forward to it\u2026 only to be gifted some bootleg not so great reviewed one in return. Also went on to say we shouldn\u2019t exchange gifts again since the expectations are high and it\u2019s more of a monetary value.\n\nI went on to say that the event we went to, I treated them for their birthday was well over the price of the blender and some. However I was thinking of the value of it rather than the dollar amount. I guess some people will remain cheap no matter how old they get. \n\nThey\u2019ve stopped communicating with me and for some time, I did not even notice.

I feel like we're not agreeing on as much as we used to, and it seems like she wants to turn everything into an argument.  Today, while out shopping for groceries, I decided to buy a cheaper brand of a type of sauce that she likes.  We're trying to save for a house, and we can't afford to buy super expensive stuff.  We haven't even gone out to eat or gone to the movies in months.\n\nAnyway, I got home with the sauce, and she flips out, saying that she knows the brand that she likes and that this was lower quality and gross.  I calmly tried to explain my reasoning, but the logic didn't seem to matter to her.  She told me that I had been ignoring her a lot lately and that she didn't feel as though she was being heard.  I found this very ironic, since I was very clear about how much we needed to save over the next few months, yet she wants to go back to our old standard of living.  Finally, I had enough of her nonsense, and I started raising my voice, telling her that money doesn't grow on trees and that she's nuts if she thinks we're going to be able to afford a house later this year if we don't save now.  \n\nI then told her that she needed to learn how to control her emotions and stop being so entitled.  I even suggested that she attend therapy to begin being a more level-headed and rational person.  She absolutely erupted at this, accused me of sexism, and told me that if she were a man, there's no way I would have said what I said.  I laughed in disbelief and told her that she clearly has emotional problems, as well as delusions, and that therapy could really help her out.  As she stormed off, I told her that I was only trying to help her, but she never even acknowledged me and simply slammed the bedroom door shut.\n\nNow I'm worried that she will spend money lavishly just to spite me and that her destructive behavior will sabotage our financial goals.  I want my wife to see things from my perspective, but I think she may have a personality disorder that needs fixing by a professional.  I'm totally exhausted by the situation, and I feel like a constant pawn in my wife's twisted games.  She's still in the bedroom and refuses to talk to me, even after I slid a list of therapists under the door.

The man says and it goes. That extends all the way to your uncles, and grandparents... in my house, that was not the case, but some of my uncles operate like that.\n\nWell, like any other young guy, as a kid, I got in trouble and fights sometimes. Nothing major, but they happened every now and again. This man would literally sit down in front of my face and actively try to convince my dad to send me to a religious boarding school back home, which was common to do for troublesome kids at the time. Those boarding schools aren't like the posh ones you see in movies. No. I knew many kids that went there and came back with serious PTSD. Without going into details, they were awful to the students. Very, very awful.\n\nI knew my dad wouldn't entertain the idea, but the thought of this man sitting in my parent's living room plotting against me wasn't it.\n\nThis dynamic went on from the ages of 8 to 17. Every time he saw me somewhere, he had to come with his arrogant comments about not dressing like this or acting like that and trying to embarrass me in front of people, despite himself being unemployed for 5 years straight. He also had the habit of making stuff up.\n\nIn our culture, PDA is frowned upon, and he would tell my parents that he saw me with girls doing indecent stuff, which was never true. My parents never mentioned it to me because I was no longer 12 and my fuse with that man was shortening. My sisters were the ones telling me all of that. Despite all of that, I still gave him the respect of \"Hi and Bye\" but avoided him at all costs. I couldn't stand the guy and neither did my cousins. He has also wronged my family a lot over the years in money matters and more, but they have the religious view of \"forgive and forget\". on everything.\n\nWell, he passed away recently, and it turns out that unsurprisingly, he had no savings whatsoever and had not been sending the required monthly amount to a fund we have as a family for these events. The funeral will be expensive and I am the only person in the family who can afford to pay the full amount without it affecting my circumstances at all.\n\nMy parents and family asked me to do so and are guilt-tripping with religious talks about \"forgive, God said...\" but I declined. I feel sick to my stomach for declining but I feel just as sick to my stomach when I think about doing so after all he said and tried to do against me (and my siblings) over the years, which is a lot (nothing inappropriate but still a lot more than disclosed).

Long story short, my bio parents divorced when I was around 4, and i moved to the U.S. when I was 11, my step dad is a really nice guy, he loves me and treated me better than my bio dad. Over the 16 years of my life, my mom has relentlessly insulted me under the cover of \u201cconstructive criticism\u201d, but it wasn\u2019t, she is the reason that I have a low self confidence and anxiety.

I won\u2019t go too much in detail about what she has done in the past, but one event that happened recently has got me to revisit it all. So it was the day of my birthday, about a month and a half ago, she came into my room at 10:30 pm, and asked me to clean my room, I had school tomorrow and the room wasn\u2019t dirty, it was just not the way she liked things. Anyways, I said that I\u2019ll do it tomorrow since it was late, and she absolutely threw a fit like a 5 year old and threw everything in my room on the floor, and then she demanded that I clean my room, which then I refused again because it was ridiculous, fast forward to tomorrow when I come home from school, everything has been put into 3 separate trash bags, I slept without sheets or blanket for a week straight, at the end, I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and I ran away from home, I walked for about 2 hours in the 34 degree weather without a coat,it\u2019s a really childish way to deal with an issue, I know.

She comforted me and no drama took place for a few days, until today, just an hour ago I took multiple depression and anxiety tests and scored way too high on it, and the way I matched the symptoms was scary, I told my step dad and he said he will get me help and we will talk to someone, then he told my mom, she came barging into my room and said in a very sarcastic tone that she knows me better than myself, and I can\u2019t be depressed, I feel hopeless right now because by the looks of it my step dad is staying neutral or leaning towards her side, am I the asshole for under appreciating what I have right now?

We were together for a 1 1\/2 years and we lived together for almost a year.\nThis might be a long one but I just can't stop going in circles feeling like an AH and need an outside opinion.\n\nFrom the moment he moved into my home we started arguing a lot more not to mention he lived rent free for months.\nI have always been loyal, I did his washing, made him pack lunches for work, cleaned the house, the dishes, the garden, I even did all the renovating. I would get so frustrated he never helped out but if I moaned about it, that would just lead to another argument. They ended up very intense. I can't go into detail due to the rules in this sub but you get the idea.\n\nStart of Febuary 2023 we went out for drinks and food, we stopped ar 2 bars before we got to food so as you could assume the alcohol went straight to our heads. It was a fun day so far, full of laughter until we got to bar number 2 while we decided where to eat, we had a beer. We were standing at a booth and an older man came over with a chair for me and said to my ex he shouldn't leave a lady standing. I giggled a bit and thanked him as it was kind with no ill intenr. This ticked him right off and he stormed out.\n15 mins later he comes back, he's calmed down we finish out drink and go for food.\nNice little bar in the centre of town. We order food, I get a dessert while he gets a main, his food comes but mine doesn't and I moaned a little something along the lines of \"ugh didn't you say you wanted them at the same time\" rolling my eyes. He kicks up about me moaning and how he's gone out with me today and paid for a few rounds and all I can do is complain.\n\nThat's when he pours a pint and  a half of beer over me and walks out.\nI am humiliated, drenched. The bar was busy, people were looking. The manager came over to check on me and dry everything up and move me over, he left me alone after a brief check to kinda come to terms with the situation I guess. He had done this to me before.\nMy ex comes back, I said \"why did you do that to me, why did you even come back\" and he replied \"oh so I shouldn't have bothered then, f you\" and pours my glass of wine over me and tries to walk away with my hand bag this time. Manager stops him gets my bag and he leaves. \nIn the end I got home safe and locked the doors, I never let him back into the house, it's been just over a month and I've told him I wanted his stuff out of my house, he's not bothered other than to take a bag to his mums a few hours away. \n\nLast week I told him I was leaving everything outside for him to collect he's been aware, it's been there and unfortunately the weather hasn't been on his side and it's been raining.

She stated that the plans were made a few days ago and she was \"telling me now\". But she had only brought it up because she was prompted the question. She never asked if I was free that weekend so she had no idea if I could even make it. (and she most likely didn't care).\n\nObviously, her telling the dinner table was not a personal invite for me. If she wanted me to come she would have said \"you should join us\" or \"come with!\" Or perhaps she would ask if I was even busy that weekend before making plans. But she did not do any of that. I fear that she will feel the need to invite me out of pity because she accidentally brought it up. I will not feel welcome to join them at that point.\n\nMy sister and I are equally close with these cousins. We rarely ever get to see them. I am also very sad that neither of them told me either.

I've invited a group of my friends and a group of my brother's friends (we are twins - so we decided to have a joint house party) \n\nMy friend has pretty severe ADHD, and when he is drunk he gets very bad - becomes very confrontational, rude, and kinda ruins the party by picking fights with people.

I've set ground rules specifically with him, to make sure that he understands that my house cannot get trashed. \n\nHowever, when he drinks he tends to go very overboard, and I fear he cannot control himself, furthermore when he drinks alcohol he is of course off medication, which sometimes I can find him a lot to deal with. But he is very sweet, and I do enjoy his company. \n\nI'm thinking of not drinking and trying to set an example to him that maybe he should lay off the drinks a bit, and so he doesn't feel I'm not letting him drink I won't drink with him. This will likely anger him and I'm afraid he will go off into a rage even before the party. \n\nI'm just not sure what to do about him because when he drinks at other parties he has smashed walls, broken vases, and tried to jump off the roof of a shed (however these parties had no parental supervision.) \n\nI do want to let him have a good time but I'm just scared he'll react very badly if I tell him to stop drinking, and will refuse and make a scene.

My home is three hours away on the coast, which I love. I have always said I would never want to take him away from his farm, but it\u2019s just not a future I want for myself. \n\nIWhen we last spoke about it he said he was waiting for me to \u2018change my mind\u2019. I almost called the relationship off and even left my grandads 80th birthday party to travel up to him and discuss it in person, because he was feeling too upset to travel.

Which is true I don\u2019t, because I\u2019ve been clear it\u2019s not what I want. He also told me off for not meeting his Nan, even though mine had just died a couple of weeks before from dementia.\n\nAfter he graduated we got a flat so we could be together for my last year of uni. As soon as I graduated, he moved out after I begged him to stay. He wanted to go back to the farm now that my uni was over. I was devastated. At this time I was also planning a world back packing trip after coming into some inheritance money. I was going to pay for him to come with me. This trip never happened because he refused to help me plan. \n\nSince then I\u2019ve asked him multiple times if he would consider working away from home for a few years so we could live together. Or if I lived near him if he would take weekends off so we could be together. Since I would have no friends or family in the area. He said no. \n\n Now a decent job opportunity has opened up in his area. It would be good for my career but it is a stepping stone I will move on from in a few years. We have agreed to move in together in the mean time and are now looking for a house. \n\nAMTA for moving in with him knowing I\u2019ll move away in a few years?

She was kept in the garden, clearly over-bred and moderately malnourished, so my friend couldn\u2019t leave her there due to the red flags and brought her home. Her dog at home didn\u2019t get along with the rescue dog, she is 7 months pregnant, has a little boy and her partner works away for a week at a time and couldn\u2019t look after her. She called me and asked if we wanted to have her, and said if we couldn\u2019t she\u2019d have to take her to the pound or the police. Knowing this I couldn\u2019t simply let her take this innocent dog somewhere she\u2019d be put down so I agreed to take her. I asked the relevant questions as any new dog owner would, and found out that she was good on the lead, good while walking, she wasn\u2019t phased by other dogs, is scared of men and doesn\u2019t like cats. The original owners also said that she only had 1 litter in June 2022. \n\nNow she is in my care, I have had her for 4 days. The first day we took her straight to the vets, they found she had mouth ulcers and prescribed antibiotics which we didn\u2019t mind paying for. They also said she was defo over-bred and had a litter recently. She was good as gold the whole day, she enjoyed her hour and a half walk and didn\u2019t cause us any issues other than going absolutely mental at other dogs. \n\nMore recently, she is loads healthier, her antibiotics seem to be working and she\u2019s also coming out of her shell. Now her personality is showing through, at home she\u2019s lovely, gentle a bit dopey and very sleepy. However she barks at every dog that barks, any kind of noise, people walking above us and goes absolutely mental in the garden to the point she\u2019s climbing our fence. Walking is a different story, it\u2019s like a WWE match with her, she does not listen, she is not good on the lead and she is also going for every dog she sees, whether it be a stone throw away, in the distance or across the road she\u2019s going for it. My partner is a strong man, and he is just about strong enough to hold her back. \n\nWe made the difficult and dreadful decision to rehome her to someone that can train her well and can look after her and give her a good life. We helped her back onto her feet, gave her the correct medicine, gave her 5 small meals a day, loads of treats and lots of playtime.

With college coming soon, I'm trying to have as much fun with her as possible. Unfortunately, with my busy schedule of school, work, and motocross, I haven't seen her since Valentine's. So, I planned a special date for us to spend some quality time together before my 45-hour work week started.\n\nA few weeks back she took me to a childhood store of hers so I planned to take her to someplace from my childhood that I thought she might like... Ikea. It's not the best idea in the world and doesn't exactly make me hyped but it's a nice experience to try the displays and eat the food they serve which is always good. Next was a stop at an ice cream spot I've been going to since I was 9, a walk in the park, a sunset by the lake and maybe a movie after. I like to do a lot of stuff with her especially because I don't see her a lot and I was looking forward to the experience.\n\nHowever, when she got in the car, I noticed she was kind of tired from her 5 hour shift. I tried to keep things light and fun, and I offered her a pillow to rest her head during the long drive. But she seemed distant and gave one-word answers. She hasn't ever acted like this before.\n\nWe arrive and she then nonchalantly tells me she forgot her pain meds. She fixes her hair and still isn't talking and is giving me a look. I try poking because we do this all the time and she says it really is nothing and everything is fine. She has zero energy or excitement once we go in, just follows me and looks at me blankly. I try and make jokes that usually make her laugh and she just looks embarrassed. I take her to the stuffed animals to see of that could cheer her up a little and it's the same. I then asked if she wanted to go somewhere else or if she wanted to leave and she just shrugged and said \"I don't really care\".\n\nIn my head if she's been exhausted and bored so far, nothing is going to change for the rest of the date and it'd be best to just take her home. I'm not gonna drag her through the experience. I told her \"Alright, I'm just gonna take you home\" and we got in the car. I then said \"I had a whole night planned out but you're just real tired right now so I'm gonna take you home. I really sucks but it's for the best,\" and we spent an hour on the freeway in silence and she hasn't talked to me since and it's been almost a day.\n\nMaybe I missed a cue and should have just gone for ice cream and a movie, but I wanted to make the night memorable. I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but I feel like I may have been the asshole in this situation. She hasn't talked to me since, and I'm not sure how to fix things.

In fact he normally calls but didn't at all that night. \n\nSo AITA for not answering my partner's calls?\n\nEdit: All I'm asking him to do is to come up to bathe, dress and ensure I can reach everything to feed her. Remember I can't stand up I move around on my knees and my mom and siblings is gone so we need him for just an hour or an hour and a half in the morning.\n\nEdit: I am capable of doing everything else except for the bath time and clothing. He lives 5-10 minutes away from me. I don't just sit around I move around on my knees to get things done. I work as well we live in a third world country so I'm self employed due to discrimination.\n\nEdit: he only called 2 more times and stopped. As I said he lives close and he didn't pop by to check to see if we're okay.","upvote_ratio":0.78,"created_utc":1678629776.0},{"title":"AITA for not wanting my boyfriend to drive high?","author":"Character-Map-5945","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/11piceo\/aita_for_not_wanting_my_boyfriend_to_drive_high\/","text":"Last night my boyfriend and I were going to the store, and on our way there he mentioned he was a little boolin (he had smoked weed).

Later that day, my dad was talking to Layla on speaker phone and asked Layla about what she was up to that day since she couldn't watch Mary. She said she had told my mom that she would watch Mary, claiming she told her this three times. This was obviously a lie, and my mom (who was in the room, unbeknownst to Layla) called her out on it, which started an argument, and ended with Layla saying, \"Hah, OkAy \\[moms name\\].\" in a very disrespectful tone.

I(14f) am Jewish. Last Tuesday was a holiday called Purim, which is a bit like Halloween but on steroids. On of Purims traditions is to give money to whoever asks, whether they be rich or poor. Usually this is fulfilled by giving to charity, however many adults keep money in their wallets to give to children, or to people who are collecting for charity.\n\nMy house has a huge party every year on Purim, with many people. I noticed my brother(12m) and his friend(10m) were asking people for money, because they were bored and wanted cash. I however was pissed when I learnt that they were lying to people about what the money was for, and they were instead telling people they were collecting for charity when I knew they weren\u2019t. \n\nNot only was I disgusted by their blatant lying, but I was also disappointed that my brother agreed to do this when I know he generally doesn\u2019t even care for money. \n\nI called them out on this and spoke to my mother, who was even more pissed than I was. My brother didn\u2019t deny what he did when confronted, and did have the decency to look a bit ashamed of himself. However, he also told my mother that I was equally as guilty since I had been asking for money too.\n\nI told him that wasn\u2019t fair, since when I asked I was honest about it simply being for personal gain. He said that I was still taking making from people for no reason, but I argued that I was honest about my intentions and the people I asked were free to say no. \n\nMy mother ended up forcing my brother to donate all the money he made to charity (plus all of his birthday money) as a lesson, which ended up being over $2000 dollars in total. But my brother demanded I also give the money I got to charity. \n\nI reminded him that earlier in the year I held a huge fundraiser for a children\u2019s hospital, and that after working on that for months and raising thousands of dollars I could afford to be a little self indulgent. The $300 dollars I made that day were going to be used for buying myself a new bookshelf and some more manga, and that was that. I also said that how I spent the money was none of his business, and if he was honest maybe he wouldn\u2019t have had to give it all up.\n\nMy brother now refuses to talk to me and while I think he\u2019s being immature, my friends have said that my brother was right and I should have donated all my money. They said it was unfair for me to criticize him and I should have just left it alone, and since I decided to tell on him I should at least give my money too. I already ordered the bookshelf and manga, and I still don\u2019t think I did anything wrong.

I was told to take a week off work to mostly rest, and no gym for 4 weeks. I still move a bit funny, but can cook, shower, get dressed, climb stairs, and sit\/stand\/walk for as long as I'm comfortable (\\~ 2h\/1h\/1h as of the past days). I was advised to be cautious but active, and to walk around frequently from day 0. \n\nI live with my boyfriend (M26). He's the one who drove me to the surgery and back, and has been insisting I'm too careless with my recovery. For the record, I've been following my doctor's instructions, and she says I'm doing great (I had a check up 2 days ago).\n\nNow, for the actual story. We have a cat together. Yesterday we noticed one of his eyes was closed. I inspected it and it looked very bad; I thought he might be blind of that eye. We decided to take him to the vet, which is 5 minutes away by car. We always go together, partly for help but mostly because we love this cat a lot and both want to be there with him. But when I told my boyfriend I wanted to go, he didn't  let me speak. He just said, \"obviously you're not coming\". \n\nI tried to explain that I was well enough to go, as long as he was the one driving and carrying him, as those are the only 2 tasks I wouldn't feel comfortable with. I would only have to sit for a 5 minute drive and walk\/stand for 20 minutes. These are things I've been doing since the day of the surgery, multiple times per day. \n\nI couldn't really get in a word, because he cut me off. He said I I should get out of the way and let him help our cat since I couldn't. He called me selfish and said I was only making things harder. I have to admit, at this point I kind of lost it. I started crying, shouted at him and threw something I was holding on the floor. I just felt so frustrated and powerless, because I already knew what would happen. Small disagreements like this have been going on since my surgery day. \n\nHe picked the cat and stormed off to our car. I walked to the car as well, but when I got there he locked the doors and flipped me off. I positioned myself behind the car and gestured for him to let me in. He slowly backed off until the car bumped against me. At that point I moved to the side and knocked on the window, begging for him to let me in. He flipped me off again and drove away. I stayed home crying until he texted some 30 minutes later saying our cat's eye would be fine.\n\nThis morning he said he wouldn't speak with me unless I apologized. He wants me to admit that it was stupid and selfish of me to want to go. He says I made it all about myself, and that I always have to be the center of attention even when our cat is in danger. I don't think that's fair, because I was fine enough to go. While I appreciate the concern, and understand he had good intentions, I don't think he has the right to impose them like that.

My father passed when I was 3, and my sister has been no-contact with her father since she was 15. \n\nWhen I was in my second last year of highschool my mom started dating a guy. Let's call him D. D has a son (14-15, I believe). She'd often go to his place (about 2 hours away from home) on certain weekends. Bringing my sis and I once of twice. \n\nWe moved in with him right before my last year of highschool started (it my my choice as I wanted to use it as a way to make friends in the area). Well, quickly, things started to go downhill. \n\nI'm a very lighthearted person. I tease people jokingly if I like them. D's son would tell his dad that my sis and I bullied him even when we'd barely interact as he would often hide away playing games. \n\nD wouldn't talk to us about this. He'd get mad and taking out on everything around him without saying why he's mad until he calms down. And this would be raising his voice, slamming doors, throwing things. (Which is why loud sudden noises are now trigger an anxiety attack for me) \n\nThis would happen anytime his son had a problem with my sis or I. Which were about very minor things. \n\nMy mom would tell us to just stop interacting with him or stop doing something. I had asked her once \"so you want us to not be ourselves\" hoping she'd deny it. She did not. (This was after we stopped interacting with him and the accusations and anger didn't stop, not because i was told to stop teasing him)\n\nLong story short, the start of my second semester of my last year, he suddenly kicked us out. Mom had to pull me out of school to pack.We went back to our hometown to live with our grandparents. \n\nI graduated and moved to a college dorm. So I was very surprised when I was told mom moved in with D as \"roommates.\" Even more surprised when they were engaged the following summer. \n\nI've tried talking with her about how emotionally abusive he is or how toxic their relationship is, but it's like talking to a brick wall that says it will change. \n\nFor personal reasons, i won't disclose, I currently live with them, and I hate it. If I could be anywhere else right now, I would, but I have nowhere else to go because my job is here as I save up once more for college.\n\nThere have been a MULTITUDE  of other bad things that he's done, but there are too many to list here.\n\nRecently, they've been talking about having the wedding THIS year. And the more I think about it, the more I want to confront my mom once more, but tell her that if she continues with the wedding, I will...\n\u2022Refuse to be in the wedding party\n\u2022stop visiting her. Only seeing her on holidays that take place at my grandparents (1-2 times a year)\n\nI feel like she cares more for D and his son than she does for my sis and I. \n\nIt's either us or him, but my anxiety is making me think that that's going too far.\n\nSo WIBTA?\n\nEdit: For more clarification, most of what the staring drama happened when i was 16. I'd like to add that Ds son and I get along fine now (I did apologize every time i found out something upset him in the past), but D finds smaller issues to have anger fits about (Ex: one time he couldn't find super glue, so he started yelling and slamming drawers for 2 days straight) \nMy mom has complained about him talking\/flirting with other women on FB and dating sites and how stressed he makes her. \nMy main goal with giving the ultimatum is more to open her eyes to the effects of what he does. I'm worried about her health. And think that if something actually happens that she will finally make good on moving out like she has said she'd do hundreds of times before.","upvote_ratio":0.72,"created_utc":1678614588.0},{"title":"AITA for asking my roommate to throw uneaten food away.

I'm not saying she can't meet him at all - but my boyfriend and I are thinking about having the first 2 weeks after he's born to ourselves and then begin allowing extended family to come meet him etc.   \n\nI mentioned something to my dad about this today, and he's already (in my mind) taking her side and telling me to \"stop acting this way\" and to \"not even bring it up.\" I called him out for saying that because he knows that she'll throw a tantrum and it'll become a big deal.

She wouldn't be at my place to eat until close to 12, and would stop at my place immediately before going home. She almost always shares food she\/her family makes with not just me, but my grandmother.\n\nSo when my grandmother and her boyfriend get back, I didn't initially think anything. She went to her room and he went to the kitchen. I smelled the bratwurst out to him.\nI asked him if he was eating, he said yes.

She's a nice girl but gets on my nerves sometimes because she's always over. I really don't think she's right for my son, either. Our tapwater has a weird aftertaste so I order gallon water bottles and use them to refill a big glass bowl with a tap.\n\nIt is not cheap to get water and other groceries delivered, so I tell my sons, husband, and the girlfriend to be courteous of the other people who live here and not use up the water, as it runs out fast in our big household.\n\nYesterday, I caught her filling up her big metal water bottle with the jug water, and I calmly told her that other people live here, too, and she shouldn't hog the water all to herself. She was rather short with me and said something along the lines of: \"Actually, this water bottle is big enough to hold all the water someone should be drinking in a day. I'm not hogging water, I'm just trying to stay hydrated.\"\n\nI found her tone to be disrespectful and ordered her to leave. She scoffed and went back to my son's room. That's when I really got frustrated. I opened their door and told her she has to leave. My son got really angry with me and told me that my girlfriend didn't do anything wrong and why is it a crime for her to drink water? I explained that I order this water for our family to use, not leeches who hang around all day rent-free. My son's girlfriend got a little teary eyed and left the room and out the front door without saying anything.\n\nMy son told me that I was a major asshole and should have just minded my business. I think she's just wasteful and a brat. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the comments. I have spoken to my son about the issue, and you all made me realize that it was deeper than just the water. I showed him this post and explained that it's not her, it's me. I think she reacted that way when I initially told her off for filling up the bottle because--and my son helped me realize this, too--I was never really nice to her to begin with, in the course of their three year relationship (in my defense, she only started hanging around our house a lot about six months ago because she got a license). \n\nWe called her on the phone this morning and I apologized for my reaction to the bottle. I explained I didn't mean to make her feel bad about the water--it really wasn't that big of a deal, and I feel silly for making it a big deal. She apologized for having an attitude and explained how she can feel a little defensive around me sometimes. I told her and my son that I will work on my attitude. My husband still thinks she was being disrespectful but I explained that I'm the reason she felt the need to act that way in the first place. It's not my choice who my son decided to date and I need to respect his choice. I think she is a sweet girl, and I feel horrible for the way I have been treating her. Again, thank you to everyone for making me realize my mistake.\n\nPS: I have looked into purchasing a Brita pitcher to see if that is more cost effective.

Even when its not their responsibility they are fine with that and they are fine with his brother to eat all their food (even if they're short of) but they seem to have a problem with me.\n\nSee, my boyfriend is a hard-working person who's worried about his parents but he always puts them first, even if that means for him to be in debt because they have (and use) some of his credit cards. What bothers me the most is that they don't even ask properly for money, they just call and whine about their situation for my bf to send them money but they continue to do all the things that put them there in the first place.

He was legit yelling at me. Anyway, obviously none of the girls made way for me because I guess they're not okay with us \"commoners\" sitting with them, so I made a joke to my best friend and said something along the lines of \"aren't you gonna say anything\" and both my best friend and the guy started mocking me and being like \"what would I say\" and like \"as if him saying anything would change anything\", but I feel like my best friend could've at least made way for me.\n\nAnyway, the situation ended with me stepping away cause honestly I was feeling humiliated and the guy ended up sitting elsewhere anyway so he could've very easily stepped aside for me to sit.

She spent several days at friends\u2019 homes and one of the nights sleeping on a night bus. The friends she has been hanging around with are trouble and alcohol and possibly drugs were involved. 4 nights after she ran away, myself and a friend tracked her down to a park and were able to convince her into my car (she was drunk). When we got to her mum\u2019s house she freaked out and refused to go in. Both my niece and her mum agreed that she would come to my house for the night.\n\nI live with my wife, our two sons (7\/8), and my two teenagers (16F\/16M). My daughter was the reason we knew she was at this park, as a friend who was there posted on social media. I also have an older daughter (22) that had been trying to talk her into going home. My niece is my wife's sister's daughter, and her dad isn't present in her life. She has a younger sister and a stepbrother.\n\nThe next day her mum came over to talk with her and that didn't go well. Afterwards my wife talked to her, and mum decided to leave and give her some space. They spent the rest of the day watching Netflix and trying to keep everything calm. The week after she ran away was half-term so none of the kids had school. That week her mum and sister came over every day to see her and they left the house with her a few times to go shopping and for dog walks. By the next week she was still living with us, and we were able to send her to school, where her mum talked to staff\/councillors about what was going on.\n\nCurrently, around 5 weeks after this started, my niece still lives with us. She is having meetings with councillors and is mostly following the rules of our home. However, she has continued to get in trouble at school (despite showing some improvement at completing her homework and revising) and there has been times where she has come home from school late and lying about where she was. Her mum is fed up with this situation and wants her daughter to come home. She has turned on us and is demanding we kick her daughter out. Her daughter has only been able to stay with us up to now because her mum allowed it, now we are unsure how to proceed.\n\nMy wife and I don't feel comfortable sending her away. Over the last weeks whenever anyone has begun pushing her to go home, she starts acting out again. It also does not seem that anyone has gotten to the root of the issue of why she is acting this way. We told my SIL that we would not force her out but would continue to encourage her to go home and suggested to SIL that she continues to communicate with her daughter and persuade her home rather than forcing her. Both her and her husband are now telling us that we are meddling in their family and are threatening to call the police. My wife's parents agree that we are in the wrong and the niece\u2019s behaviour is just bratty teenage acting out.

Anyways...) and I started going off about her not shutting up. H didn't really say anything, but she kind of glared at P. \n\nP was mad for a few days, but after the weekend, she continued speaking to us after H had to explain i was on my period (didn't give her permission, but I forgive her because I, too, felt guilty for yelling at P.)\n\nBut in conclusion, AITA for yelling at P like this??

We both live a few hours away in the US, so I\u2019ve been able to meet him twice and confirm he has the same playful and friendly nature irl (and that we have great chemistry). But two days ago, he suddenly dumped me when I made a joke about only wanting to eat bacon for the rest of my life (it\u2019s not really funny the way I\u2019m phrasing it right now, but that\u2019s truly only it). He took it as an attack on his religion and accused me of being inconsiderate and disrespectful, which caused a massive fight that led to him dumping and blocking me everywhere before I could get a chance to respond back. \n\nWe\u2019ve discussed our religious differences many times before, and agreed that we both still mutually respected and cared about each other and would never let this get in the way of eventually becoming married.

However, we had many fights since then (not necessarily about religion either) and even had a falling out three months ago. I still love him but I admittedly felt driven away and no longer played with the idea of converting, at least for the time being.

We told her the truth as we all love the niece and don't want her in such a shitty environment. If she had an option to get an education thats 10  times better and to know she is safe in school, we would all want that for her.  She took this into consideration and chose a smaller, catholic but laid back privage school for her as the main option. Two people objected to this. My niece, of course and my MOTHER.  My mother is very paranoid about people and protective of her family and the idea of my niece going to a school thats sort of far, and the after school plan (my niece afterschool will have to take the public bus to a local shop, do some homework until her mom gets off work, which is like for 40ish minutes or so.) she refuses to allow it. She says shes infuriated with bell but also mad at me and my sister- for, get this \"bad mouthing our school and making sure my sister won't pick it\" she belives we told her those things so she, (niece) would not attend the same school as us.

I\u2019ve been waiting for management to say something to him, but that has yet to happen. \n\nThe final straw was yesterday. There was a stock delivery in the morning and he was stood behind his till not helping. He was going on his phone when no customers were present (**there is a no phone policy**). Hence, leaving the other employee he was on shift with; bringing stock in from the pallets outside, re-stocking shelves and taking stock that couldn\u2019t go out\/be filled downstairs into the warehouse. \n\nThere are only twelve employees, two per shift. Everyone has the same responsibilities except for the manager and assistant manager. Everyone has to serve customers, re-fill shelves and help with deliveries as it\u2019s a two person job.\n\nEveryone in the shop dreads working with him, as they have to multitask, fulfilling all areas within the store by themselves. Doing his job and theirs.\nBring stock up from downstairs, re-filling shelves, serving customers and facing stock.\n\nDue to this I and other disgruntled employees thought he needed a reality check, to which I happily obliged sending  the following messages:\n\nI\u2019ve seen that after your first week or so, that your standard of work has significantly depleted. This can be shown, through you not helping when needed, including; re-stocking, bring stock up from downstairs and facing stock.\nDuring shifts you normally stand behind your till on your phone for practically the whole entire shift. Only coming out of your till either for your brake, for change, cash lifts, to stare at the juice isle or newspapers. Sometimes venturing to the door for some fresh air or to possibly re-fill the 2L which is rare. Meaning that you will be behind your till for approximately six and a half\/seven hours consecutively. \nHence, showing that your work ethic is simply atrocious and I\u2019m surprised that you still have a job\u2026 \nWait no I\u2019m not, as the shop can\u2019t pick and choose who they employ, as they struggle retaining employees.\nDue to this I have decided that if we are on shift together, that I will be taking a pro-active approach. Mimicking what you have been doing, during your shifts to see if anything changes\/improves with yourself.\n\nOn further thought.. I realise that the above message was rather out of the blue. I sent that message due to others feeling unable\/not wanting to voice there opinions of what it is like working on shift with you. \nHence, I stepped up\/volunteered to be the spokesperson\/messiah. I hope it didn\u2019t come across too rash, but I needed to detail your shortcomings in great detail so that you could visualise the reality that others face. \nI chose to send a message compared to speaking to you, as I thought that I would miss specific and important details. If you feel that this is unjust and want to speak in person that is totally fine.\nI have no malice towards you, you\u2019re a nice person. \n\nIt\u2019s just to see AITA, were the messages sent too cheeky or just straight to the point?\n\n\nEdit::\n\nI have brought it up to management, they have also realised it themselves. \nHowever, the temporary assistant manager was previously a senior retail assistant. Hence, has no authority but is only fulfilling the duties of a assistant manager until one is found.\nThe temporary manager has mentioned to the assistant manager that he will pull the colleague in question aside, but this has yet to happen. Nothing has been done.\nThis is mainly due to, the temporary manager having his own store. Therefore, he only works two shift\u2019s sometimes fewer a week. Depending on the situation at his store.\n\nAlso, he makes snide remarks about customers if they complain. For instance, about incorrect pricing etc.\n\nIf you mention that you would like help from him to fill stock etc. \nHe may help for approximately five or so minutes. Then he will return behind the counter as soon, as a customer is their and will remain there on his phone. \nSo you basically have to urge\/plead for help. However, sometimes he will straight out refuse\u2026 \n\nWe both were hired for the exact same position, same job descriptor.

I don\u2019t want random people to be in our wedding photos and videos that we are going to have forever. I expressed this to him before and I felt disrespected and disregarded that he did not speak to me prior to telling his friends that this was okay.

We had good jobs, decent money, two kids and loved each other. Then he got diagnosed with a rare form of cancer and we went through years of painful treatments and recovery together.\n\nWe moved to a small house to be close to the research center where he underwent treatment. His parents paid half of the down payment on the house, the other half was from our savings and investments. In the divorce he gave me the house and took all of his medical debt. We have been divorced a year, but now his cancer has come back and he needs treatment again at the same research hospital. He wants to stay in what is now my house while undergoing treatment and his parents expect me to house him and look after him because he was generous in letting me have the house without taking his rightful share from the equity.\n\nWhen we were married and he was undergoing treatment, it was new stuff that was expensive and also very physically draining on him. We were lucky that both our jobs were supportive and flexible, but with his health issues, little kids and expenses, we had to downgrade our lifestyle a lot. That plus the physical changes in his body made him very depressed. Whenever he felt a bit better, he'd go stay in his hometown. It's a small town where most of his family and a lot of his childhood friends live. \n\nI was doing all the care-taking of him, while also dealing with insurance complications. I was also managing the kids, the entire household and my full time job. We had help from friends and neighbors but it was very hard. I wasn\u2019t happy about him spending his healthy days away from us, but it was good for his mental health so I didn\u2019t feel like I could object. \n\nWhile he was staying there he had reconnected with his high school girlfriend. A couple years ago he admitted to me that he was sleeping with her and I filed for divorce. He had fully recovered from his cancer by then. There are other aspects around the cheating that left me very heartbroken and feeling betrayed. His giving me the house and taking all the debt was an apology of a sort.\n\nHis parents feel that I owe him for getting the house and should let him stay there for the 2-3 months his treatment is at the facility.

He was with a couple of his friends and my sister in a beach town a couple hours from home. He explained the situation, apologized, and asked if I would come pick them up.\n\nI was able to get to them not long after 1am. When I got there my sister was very drunk and my son had marks on his face. They had clearly been drinking all day and just generally doing shit they shouldn't be. Apparently in the afternoon they were at the beach, and they noticed a man filming my sister. My son approached him to tell him to stop and the guy denied that he was and left. Several hours later when they were walking around town, they noticed the same man following them. My son again approached him to tell him to leave them alone and things escalated. After this incident, my sister was very upset and was feeling really unsafe. They had gotten a ride into town with their friend\u2019s older brother, who was at this point too drunk to drive them home. Which is what led them to call me.\n\nI drove them all back to my place and had them stay the night. The next day my sister begged me not to tell our dad that she had been drinking and had lied to him about where she was. I knew if my dad found out she would be in a lot of trouble and probably grounded for the rest of the summer. He would be extra mad knowing what happened with the man following her around and filming her. My dad is already overprotective of her, and I decided not to tell him what had happened and instead reinforce with her that she could call me any time when she feels like she's unsafe. I was worried if I told my dad what had happened, she (and my son) would be less likely to call me in the future if they needed to.\n\nHowever, when I received my sons call, I had been with my cousin and I later filled him in with what had happened, but I didn't think to tell him I didn't tell my dad. A couple days ago my dad and cousin were out drinking, and my dad mentioned my sister getting in trouble for smoking. My cousin then brought up the incident in the summer and told him everything.

All the way through this time period I supported her the best I could.\n\nI thought she had moved on after a month of her finally gaining her character back but no, she had made tons of accounts online trying to seduce Nate into dating her, Went on for a while until she had moved on and got some new friends and a potential bf. it seemed like everything had sorted itself out.\n\nOnly 2 months after Olivia supposedly moved on from her ex she found out that Nate had proposed to Chloe, At first my friend kept her cool, she didn't care. Then she found out his fianc\u00e9 was her late best friend. That was when she sunk back into depression. Again, I supported her until one day she was abnormally happy.\n\nI asked her what had put her in such a good mood and this is where it started Olivia pulled out her phone and showed me a tiktok, can't exactly remember it but it was a video about shifting minded , She then began talking about her script, reality and what was in it. It seemed great, a perfect place where she was happy and had everything she wanted.\n\nOut of curiosity I asked her to show me it and she obliged but it was horrifying. It first started with her in her \"DR.\" ( Desired Reality ) Olivia was said to be a seemingly perfect girl that very conveniently fit Nate's type and seemed to be similar to Chloe. She wrote she had a manipulative personality, had everything she wanted, got away with crimes etc. Strange, but okay. We continued to her \"S\/O.\" Unexpectedly, her bf was Nate, she had even written \"identical to CR Nate.\" Okay, this is getting really weird now but then I saw how she wanted to treat him. They were apparently very possessive of eachother and in summary a very toxic relationship but it got worse.\n\nShe wrote all about how Chloe, once again, \"identical to CR Chloe\" was treated badly by DR Olivia and all sorts of other vile stuff. When she finished she asked what I thought of it and I said exactly what I thought, that she's crazy. Olivia didn't take this well and shouted all sorts of stuff at me, how I was the crazy one, unsupportive and apparently inlove with her ex. ( Hah! The irony! ) We got into a big argument about it and it eventually ended in her storming out my house and back to her parent's place. \n\nI tried contacting her a few hours after our fight but she hasn't returned my calls or messages. I reached out to her Mother and apparently she's locked herself up in her room and hasn't left for a long time, only for her needs.

She seemed excited and pitched we split an Airbnb. \nShe told me there would be a few days out of the week I was there where we wouldn\u2019t be able to hang out due her other obligations but expressed a desire to see me and we both were excited and starting to plan a rough itinerary. We became like siblings and even to the point where I went to her for advice on things I wouldn\u2019t ask my biological sister. She would\u2019ve gone to war for me and vice versa. We sometimes would talk on the phone for 7-8 hours in one day and were both extremely looking forward to this trip. She even told me she\u2019ll meet me at the airport and pick me up in an Uber.\nPlane lands, and she texts me saying she\u2019s on her way and she brought a platonic guy friend (M25) who she\u2019s know for a while online but coincidently was in the city that weekend and their first time meeting in person. She told me he was going to be in town 2 weeks before the plane landed and I expressed desire to meet and hang out as a group cause I knew this guy meant a lot to her as well.

I attended university for less than three weeks, whilst also returning home every Friday - Sunday before I dropped out for to personal issues and moved home permanently.\n\nI should note I have not been living in the flat since the beginning of October but still pay rent as per my tenancy agreement. Bills were pay as you go and the wifi was set up in my name with a direct debit set up to my bank account. We split the cost of wifi three ways (\u00a321, \u00a37 each per month).\n\nI used to consider myself and flatmate A as one of my best friends but since maybe the week after I dropped out, communication on her end died out. I would message her but be left on delivered for days at a time, and I tried to call her twice over the space of 2 weeks but it was either no answer or was always very short and uninterested on her behalf. I even invited her to my graduation in November to which she accepted initially but did not come. I did try to approach why she didn't talk to me as much but her response was something along the lines of \"if I don't see you every day, there's no need to be friends anymore\". After this point, I let it go and haven't contacted her personally since.\n\nAt the end of December, I decided I no longer wanted to pay for the wifi in a flat I no longer lived in, with flatmates that had no interest in being in my life so I gave them the choice of swapping out the payment card on my account or me cancelling the wifi completely and they can set it up again with their own account. This I know, is two bad options, one worse than the other but I was not prepared for the responses. In short, they blamed the cost of living crisis on me, and it was already hard enough living in a two people household was bad enough, despite the fact they only pay bills for two people, not three, since I don't live there. I explained that even though I don't live there, I still have to pay rent which is no longer funded by student finance, and money I owe to student finance from my dropping out. They demanded I pay for part of the water bill when it comes. I said I would pay for my three weeks share.\n\nCut to now, I received a message from flatmate A demanding I pay a share of \u00a328 for my 12 days of living in the flat which seems ridiculous. I haven't replied to the message yet and have no idea if I should pay it or not. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I should also note that they hesitantly chose to swap out the payment card for the wifi. I gave my login and I assume they changed the email to the account as I could no longer log in and delete my card details. I believe they still tried to charge me for the next wifi payment but thankfully it was declined since all my money was in my savings account. I blocked the payments through my bank after that.","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1678663303.0},{"title":"WIBTA if I quit cutting my husband\u2019s hair and instead make him pay for a haircut","author":"EquivalentFerret_","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/11ohmq0\/wibta_if_i_quit_cutting_my_husbands_hair_and\/","text":"For a while now my husband has asked me to cut his hair, because our financial situation is quite grim and he doesn\u2019t want to spend $30 on a haircut. \n\nI\u2019m by no means a barber, and I made it clear that I would do my best, but I couldn\u2019t guarantee a nice haircut.

Everything was good for the first 3\/4 months and then I needed help taking care of my son. \n\nHere\u2019s where it gets a little complicated. I don\u2019t own car nor do I have a license, the reason mostly being my parents fault. When I was getting my hours in for driving I got into a minor accident where I bumped into a car behind me. Everyone was fine but I felt bad and my dad had yelled at me for it and I cried all the way home. After that had happened every time I tried to get someone to taking me driving, they would be like \u2018Oh no, it\u2019s scary driving with you.\u2019 So I eventually stopped asking, and I never learned to drive a vehicle. \n\nBecause of this, and the fact I worked night shift, it was hard to find daycare for my son. I asked my parents for help until I could find adequate daycare and\/or a new job, but it was difficult. Either I would find work but no daycare and vice versa.

I confided in my sibling about the situation and said please don\u2019t tell anyone, because I didn\u2019t want anyone worrying. That same sibling approached me later and said that I need to find a new job because it was unfair to my other sibling that they had to watch my son while I was at work.

In 2016 when I bought the van we already had 3 Children and one more on the way baby 4 came mid 2017.\n\nin 2019 we welcomed baby number 5\n\nIn 2021 the ram truck broke down and it was not worth fixing the engine nor did we have the extra money- so we only had 2 vehicles\n\nLater in 2022 my husband started a new job about 60 miles away so on the days I wasn't doing anything and off work and sticking close to home he would take my van to work as it was better on gas and saved money however both cars fit all the kids if needed, Last week my car finally broke down with 200k miles on it leaving us one vehicle. I LOVED that van however we saw that as an opportunity to buy a new vehicle. The jeep is starting to fall apart and is more money on gas as its a HEMI. We can only afford one payment. My husband decided to get a new 2023 Honda civic as it is a better travel vehicle for him to go to work with After we looked at a beautiful 2023 Chrysler Pacifica. His thought process is I'm closer to home with everything I do and the jeep should be fine- he works ALL day long- I work as a substitute teacher when needed and a part-time hairdresser I maybe work 16 days a month, I also run the after-school craft club, Girl Scout leader, Boy scout leader, all the kids are in sports. the jeep has NO additional space after the kids are in the car for sports equipment or groceries ext. On top of it if something happens to the jeep, we don't have a car with space for all the kids to be in.\n\nI feel like he should just buy a cheap crappy used Honda for work for like 2k to just get back and forth to work and get the van so we can have a safe reliable van for the kids and all the running around I do with the kids..

We have 2 daughters. My brother is 42, and his wife is 40F. My family is Asian and as typical, we all went into high achieving careers except for my brother.  He now works for our family's dental practice making $135k per year, for doing basically nothing . He was 26 when he met his now wife who was a single mom at the time with 2 kids. The kids were very young when they got together and to my understanding my brother took them in and raised them as his own, formally adopting them.  My parents were very tired of supporting my brothers mistakes and decided that they were done supporting him. When my husband and I got married, our wedding was fully paid for by my parents and we also received a lovely house in a great area as a wedding gift. My parents were vehemently against my brother's relationship with his then girlfriend as they felt he shouldn't be dating a single mom. My parents also inherited some racial prejudices from asian culture and I do believe that there might was a racial component to their vitriolic dislike of her as she was African American. They did not support their relationship at all and did not pay or attend their wedding. Before their wedding, they asked him to sign a prenup with his fiance, if he was to go through with the wedding, he refused and I think this only deepened the rift. I did not attend as I was doing a sabbatical overseas. My brother had trouble finding employment and approached my parents for help. They were reluctant but bought them a house where they now live rent free, and gave them some money for living expenses. My brother felt incredibly insulted that they retained the title of the house while giving a house to my husband and I. He believes that they always favoured me over him and called me the 'golden child'. They definitely did treat the grandkids very differently. However, they did not accept my brother's stepkids as their grandkids and never used to give them presents for Christmas or birthdays. Both my daughters got cars for their 16 birthday, a fully funded ride to college and grad school and a fund to buy a house. They also got lavish presents for special occasions, etc. My brother's stepkids did not get any of that though. When my brother and his wife had their biological son, my parents were not really interested in him. SIL tried to form a relationship between her kids and my parents but they refused. My father died recently, and he disinherited my brother, leaving all assets and the practice to me including their house. My brother approached me to ask for his inheritance, asking for some part of the business and money to make the lives of his kids and mine equal , saying that it was unfair that we were living lives of privilege while his family had to suffer. At the time, I refused.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT:\n\nThose asking for why my parents had to support my brother\n\nMy brother is what you would describe as failure to launch. He didn't do great in highschool or in college. He failed in his chosen degree twice before shifting to an art history degree which barely he passed. He also abused prescription drugs for ADHD and depression which were not prescribed to him and went to rehab twice. He has no marketable skills and was not able to find a job before my parents stepped in to help.\n\nHis resentment towards my family and I stems form the fact that he thinks I was our parents, particularly my dad's favourite child. That is partially true as our parents valued academic achievement very highly. My dad favoured me because I became a dentist like him and never caused any problems unlike my brother.\n\nTBH, it's cause my parents babied him a lot when he was younger.\n\n2nd edit:\n\nIt.was my father's wish for me not to help my brother's kids as he didn't consider them part of our family.\nAs it was his and my mother's money, I did not want to go against their wishes.\n\nMy mother is vehemently against helping my brother's kids.\n\n3rd edit\n\nMy brother can't sue for his inheritance.\nIt is structured in the form of a trust that controls the company for tax purposes. I retain most control however my mother also is a trustee.\n\nThere is no money is not earmarked for my mother's care.\nThe inheritance was real estate and the chain of dental practices totaling several millions of dollars.\n\nI provide for my mother through my own savings.\n\n4th edit\n\nFor those asking why I had everything paid for,\n\nIt's because my parents favoured me more. I was the studious one and I followed in my dad's footsteps to become a dentist, eventually becoming a surgeon\n My brother always had problems with studying and drugs and wasn't always a responsible person.\n\n\n My parents paid for my kids because they were proud of them. One of them is completing residency as a plastic surgeon and the other is getting her master's degree in computer science from the Ivy League school that was my Alma mater.\nMy brother's stepkids did not do as well. One of them dropped out of community college and the other is unemployed as well. His bio son has low functioning autism and is at the level of a two year old and needs constant care.","upvote_ratio":0.82,"created_utc":1678593767.0},{"title":"AITA for expecting my husband to purge his many unused belongings to make room for our first baby?","author":"Healthy-Quail-399","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/11p32ph\/aita_for_expecting_my_husband_to_purge_his_many\/","text":"My husband is wonderful, funny, loving, caring man but is not the hugest at following-through.

He and his ex ended up fighting about this as apparently she felt there was no need for her to know any of this before she had to as she was of the opinion that it'd keep her from making the same mistakes they did and had even gotten her excused from the lessons in school, she was pissed that i'd done this as it wasn't my place and she demanded their daughter come home as she didn't want her around me now but my Boyfriend made it clear that wasn't happening as his week is part of their custody arrangement.\n\nHe has defended me on this fiercely and is very angry that his ex has done this and her at her insults towards me for telling their daughter this. Maybe I could have helped avoid this situation by just telling my Boyfriend that she had no clue about any of this and leaving it to him to handle and hope things wouldn't be as bad as they ended up I was just so shocked in the moment that I ended up telling her this without thinking as at her age it's something she should know and I feel close to her I just worry that maybe I am in the wrong for doing what I did?\n\nEdit: Typo","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1678515959.0},{"title":"AITA for pushing roommate to help with moving and expressing my frustrations","author":"throwaway273610","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/11pco3j\/aita_for_pushing_roommate_to_help_with_moving_and\/","text":"So I (21F) and my roommate (21F) are looking for a new place to move at the end of the month. A little backstory, after a couple weeks of asking when we can start looking at places she finally decided we can start looking last week. I was the one setting up viewings for these houses while she did virtually nothing but nitpick everything I sent her. I told her that I would just book viewings and we can go from there and she agreed.\n\nWe decided to move into a bigger house so we could get cheaper rent. We had our friend (24F) tag along as she wanted to move with us into this new place, which I had no problem with.\n\nWe had to find a fourth person so we could get a nice house and she decided to ask her other. This girl took a while to respond so I suggested that I could post on Facebook marketplace if she says no. She had no issue with this and was open to the idea of interviewing as well. The original girl in mind said that she would think about it and I made the post on Facebook. \n\nThe first viewing day, I was under a lot of stress because of the viewings, no fourth roommate, and neither of them had any opinions about the houses. That night, I had to go to the emergency room for some health concerns and doctors suggested it was caused by stress or anxiety. \n\nWe eventually found a good house, and as soon as I got the application form in my email, I sent it to the both of them to fill out within the next day because I knew the house was gonna go fast. I fill out my portion of the form and part of my current roommates form. I asked for a couple things I was unsure of and she sent a whole new form to add in, so I adjusted some of the formatting to match mine. \n\nShe went through and told me how my writing isn\u2019t professional, I need to take advice from her, she has more experience in moving than I do (she has only moved one more time than me), etc. I shrugged it off, printed off the paper and told her to sign it and I\u2019ll scan it with our friends form. I sent an email to our friend saying that I need the form filled out and sent to me ASAP so I could apply. My roommate told me that was inconsiderate and disrespectful, our friend is working needs time to fill it out. At this point it is about 2 weeks until move time. \n\nI got a message today saying that she will ask her friend again if she wanted to be our roommate in 2 weeks, to which I responded, 5 days would not be enough time to find another person if she says no. This caused a whole line of messages saying that I am crossing her boundaries and that I need to put trust in her and our friend because they are smarter than me in this field. She said after, that I am not respecting her time or boundaries so I might have to find a new roommate and place to live if I don\u2019t smarten up. \n\nAITA?

I tried to talk to one of the coworkers about these feelings on several occasions, and we had seemed to repair our relationship on those days. For example, my parents and I were driving our group to the airport which was in a different state, and I asked that we be ready to drive to their house around noon, so we could get to the airport about 3 hours before my flight (I happened to have the earliest flight due to cancellations and rescheduling). One of the coworkers said that being at the airport early causes her anxiety because she has to just sit and wait. I tried to explain that I like to be at the airport early as I\u2019ve had random issues of being stopped or experiencing heavy traffic on the way to the airport (for some context we were flying out of JFK). So I too felt anxious, but about being late. \n\nOn the day we were leaving, the same coworker asked that if instead of driving to my parents, and then having my dad drive us to the airport, if we could have both my mom and dad meet us at the airport and and have them drive our cars home. This would mean we could leave an hour later. This was only 3 hours before we were supposed to leave. I asked my dad, but my mom already planned to work that day and couldn\u2019t. My coworker mumbled and grumbled but made sure she was ready at 12.\n\nFast forward to arriving abroad and the coworker is making a ton of comments about being annoyed that she had to wait around the airport for a few hours before her flight (We arrived about 2 and half hours before my flight). \n\nI was getting annoyed at these comments, so I told the other coworker that I was feeling annoyed by these comments. She then told me that me and the other coworker needed to \u201cstop complaining\u201d because apparently we were both complaining about the other, and she was feeling like she was on vacation with her \u201cdivorced parents,\u201d and to consider her feelings in all this. \n\nWe meet up again with the other coworker and she seemed unimpressed with the accommodations of our hostel. I had been in charge of booking all the hostels and inter-continental flights (They had also not fully paid me for these flights or hostels yet). Here I\u2019ll admit that I can be a little sensitive and probably took her attitude and complaints more personally than I should have. \n\nFinally she made another comment about being at the airport early and I snapped. I asked her to stop mentioning it because I was being hurt by it. I said it felt rude, since my parents and I had done them a favor by driving them to the airport. This led to a fight where they stormed out of the restaurant. After our fight she texted me saying I was \u201ctaking everything so personally\u201d\n\nWas I the asshole for telling her I thought what she was doing was rude?","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678625776.0},{"title":"AITA for not wanting to stay with the women","author":"Mindless-Pen-697","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/11ofngp\/aita_for_not_wanting_to_stay_with_the_women\/","text":"My boyfriend (28m) and I (22m) recently visited his family for a BBQ.

My boys are hearing and my daughter is Deaf. She can\u2019t speak at all or lipread, she communicates solely through ASL. However, she is neurotypical and has no mental or developmental delays.\n\nShe\u2019s been cheerleading since she was 3 and is very talented. On her old team she was a flyer and was doing very advanced stunts and tricks. At our old cheer gym she was on the level 5 junior team which is very high and they said that she should be moved up to level 6. But we moved over the summer and now there is only one cheer gym within an hour of us.\n\nWhen my daughter tried out she was just as good if not beyond the other girls in her age group and I really thought she would make one of the higher teams as they kept using her as an example for the other girls. But then after I was pulled aside by the coaches and told that they thought it was best for her to be on the abilities team. I never heard of that and the way they described it was that it was a team specifically for cheerleaders with disabilities to make it more inclusive. I wasn\u2019t fully aware what it meant but I said that was okay.\n\nBut now I\u2019m aware that this team is for kids who are neurodiverse or unable to participate in normal cheer.There are also older girls on the team(who also compete on their own team)who are helpers. Since my daughter is completely fine other than her lack of hearing she usually has to help out the other kids most of whom are much older than her. I am very upset by this. \n\nThe level of difficulty is far lower than what she was doing at the old gym.And she didn\u2019t volunteer to be a teacher or a aid for disabled kids, she wants to be a cheerleader. And being on this team has made her worse, not better.My boys have to work with her in the backyard everyday to ensure she\u2019s not losing any of her skills that she used to do. \n\nRight now my son interprets her since her practices are right after his and it works fine. But I\u2019ve offered them to pay for a real interpreter. But they say they fear her being on a real team would make it harder for the other kids on the team. This is ridiculous because she\u2019s become good friends with the girls her age on the normal team and they\u2019ve been very accepting even picking up some signs for her and inviting her to their team hangouts and sleepovers.\n\nThe season is mostly over so there\u2019s not much to do now but I told the head coach yesterday that if my daughter isn\u2019t on the level 6 team next year I\u2019m taking all 3 of my kids to a new gym. They need my boys since it\u2019s very hard to find boys of their skill level in cheer. They accused me of being ableist and thinking of the abilities team as lower, they think I\u2019m in denial that I have a disabled kid. And I should be grateful they let her on any team. I don\u2019t want to be mean or ableist but the team she is on is far below her skill level and I don\u2019t want her disability holding her back when it doesn\u2019t have to.

I had been planning on seeing them for a while but did not have the opportunity last semester as I was off campus and live far away from them. A month ago, I was planning on visiting B during spring break but found out that due to personal matters they would only be available for one weekend of break so that they could be with her while their work was on break. Shortly after, I ended up booking a trip from Friday night to Sunday afternoon as they had to leave Sunday night for home.\n\nI told my friend Frank (23M) that I would be visiting him and found out he had booked a trip to the same place to see a mutual friend who lives near my close friend 5 days before my departure date. (I found out the same day he booked essentially). I also found out he told our mutual friend Matt they should surprise my best friend because he was feeling down (bc I just told him our friend was having a rough time). Matt and Brandon have Friday night hangouts so we joined them Friday night and then they all came Saturday so I ended up having barely any personal time with B before leaving on Sunday. I think everyone including myself ended up having a pretty good time in the end, but I still feel annoyed he booked a similar trip to crash mine. Frank is staying with me for a few days next week, and I want to let him know I thought crashing my trip was tacky, and I did not appreciate his behavior.\n\nI think I might be the AH bc though the trip went well, I want to let him know I did not appreciate his actions. I also maybe the AH bc I know Frank wants to be closer friends with the friend group so he may have felt excluded when I did not include him in my plans bc I wanted personal time due to the limited time period. I also do not want to make him feel bad for trying to socialize more as it is something he wanted to work on, and he may have thought surprising Brandon would be a nice thing.\n\nI think he may be the AH bc he intentionally crashed my trip and did not respect my desire to spend personal time with Brandon. He already had the chance to see Brandon last fall during a get together I could not attend due to not being at school and living far away during the fall. I also think he could have talked to me if he felt excluded instead of crashing my trip or planned a trip that did not overlap mine.\n\nEdit: adding information for clarity\n\nI told Frank because I knew he wanted to plan a get together during break so this would give him info on both Brandon and I\u2019d availabilities. I don\u2019t think Frank actually ended up planning anything besides this trip. \nI also haven\u2019t seen Matt in a while but I was planning on meeting him Friday with Brandon to catch up. \nHanging out on Saturday was mostly pushed by Matt in person, but I know Frank suggested to him they visit Brandon. \nI don\u2019t think Frank is particularly close to Brandon, but I would say we are both similarly close to Matt. \nI found out about the Frank\u2019s trip from Frank himself because he let me know he\u2019d also be in the area and that he suggested to Matt they visit Brandon to surprise him while hanging out with him.\nFinally, the reasons I think Frank intentionally crashed my trip are bc as far as I understand, he made plans with the intention to also spend time with Brandon despite me letting him know I\u2019d appreciate personal time and he would have not otherwise made these plans if he did not know I was already going to the area.","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1678610723.0},{"title":"AITA for not telling my wife I think she's fat?","author":"Headless_Horseman_","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/11osxdc\/aita_for_not_telling_my_wife_i_think_shes_fat\/","text":"So all covid lockdowns were bad for my waist line and my wife's.

This is my first job out of college, where I studied costume design but specialized in Original Practice Historical Dressmaking (aka making historical clothes using historical methods) because of this, a lot of my background and expertise in sewing is stitching things by hand. Most seamstresses either hate or are indifferent to hand sewing, I absolutely love it and get very excited when I see there is something to be done by hand on my rack. My boss knows this, so whenever he sees something that needs to be handstitched, he gives it to me. \n\nMy boss also does not speak English as his first language, so the occasional grammatical error is to be expected and as long as I can understand what he means, it's totally fine.

He then told me that though it's important for him to learn English, it's also important for me to be understanding of grammatical errors since I work with a lot of non-native speakers, and as long as I understand what they mean it shouldn't be a problem.

And they were really close, hugging and kissing all the time, i didn\u2019t really minded being a third wheel there because she\u2019s always close to me when i kiss someone too, so i just shook it off. We were all hanging out in a big group and he couldn\u2019t stop pulling and kissing her everytime (we couldn\u2019t make proper conversation with her) so when he reached out again to kiss her i thought it would be funny if put my hand in the middle of the kiss and they ended up kissing my palm instead of each other, it was really funny for everyone including her, we all laughed about it. \n\nA few minutes later he pulled her aside and they started having an argument, they spended the whole party (about 5 hours) fighting about this joke, and i could tell that she was sad and over with it (she\u2019s always complaining about how jealous and insecure he is to us). \n\nWhen the fight eventually ended, she didn\u2019t came back to the group and stayed with him the whole night instead, which made me and the girls sad because we didn\u2019t get to talk to her or have fun, I asked her what was wrong and she said he was really jealous of me now because i made that joke, and was really mad too, but she didn\u2019t think i did something wrong.

This is the only way we\u2019ll able to hold on to it, and it\u2019s been in my extended family for multiple generations. We own it 50-50.\nMy brother and his wife have done far more work than me as I live an hour away and have a very demanding job which requires me to be on call constantly and sometimes on my days off.  I have definitely helped, but not as much as them. My nephew lives there full-time along with one of his friends that I don\u2019t even know, and the house is usually filthy. I assume he pays the electric bill but it might be coming out of trust money. My sister-in-law is a hard worker and has done lots of physical labor despite very serious health issues. I praise her for this both publicly and privately.\n(Edit: I included the above info because I feel it may have contributed to the feelings at hand.) \n\nMy niece announced her wedding a year ago in a venue an hour away. My fianc\u00e9 and I became engaged in September and we chose a date six weeks ahead of my niece. We\u2019re a bit older and don\u2019t want to waste any time but we absolutely were not trying to one-up anyone and I didn\u2019t even think about it until this popped up. It\u2019ll be held on the front lawn of the family home. No conflicts with the location.\nA few days ago my sister-in-law complained that our wedding invitation colors match. I was confused by this. She then asked what my actual wedding colors are, which is mainly dark green with complementary pastel colors. I was informed that my niece\u2019s color is lilac, and, looking me dead in the eye, she said quite firmly, \u201cDon\u2019t use lilac.\u201d I told her that I\u2019ve already bought most of my stuff and the color lilac might be in there even though I haven\u2019t focused on it. Also, these are two different weddings in two different locations. She said it would be a problem because some of the same people will be attending both weddings. Again, she said, \u201cDon\u2019t use lilac.\u201d\n\nI feel this is about far more than colors. She has made snarky comments to\/about me in the past but I just brushed it aside and chalked it up to her not feeling well with her health problems. \nBut\u2026 There\u2019s just something about a woman looking you dead in the eye and telling you what color to use in your own wedding. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to laugh it off and let it go, but it\u2019s really eating at me and I need resolution. I want to preserve some sense of harmony for the weddings, but I also feel she sees me as \u201clesser than\u201d and can get away with telling me what to do. I want to resolve this and stop feeling angry. \n\nAITA?","upvote_ratio":0.59,"created_utc":1678636489.0},{"title":"AITA for confronting my gf at her work place after she said she would talk shit about my sister to her cousin ?","author":"CommissionHoliday990","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/11pnlqp\/aita_for_confronting_my_gf_at_her_work_place\/","text":"My gf and my sister used to have some serious beef in the past but it was years ago and its all forgotten about except for my gf.

I noted this on the walk through sheet, and only requested that the light fixture in the walk in pantry be fixed- I fixed the disposal and got a new garage clicker. The house was also filthy, cabinets full of old food and dog hair. But I didn\u2019t initially mention this and sucked up the cleaning myself. During the first week the HVAC went out (it was in the mid eighties outside.) The property manager contacted the owner and she sent two separate HVAC companies out for quotes.

After my mom died when I was 6, it was my grandma who was the woman I felt the most comfortable seeking guidance and comfort from, not my stepmom who married my dad 18 months later. Grandma has always been an important person in my life in her own right but after losing mom she was even more special because she was a connection to my mom when my connections dwindled. After dad got back on the dating scene he packed up all traces of mom from the house and left them in the attic. When he got remarried he told me, in an effort to spare feelings, I needed to add some photos of my stepmom to my photo board that was in my room. He said it would be difficult for her to see me only post photos of him, mom and other family and not her. So while dad and my stepmom wanted me to turn to her, to lean on her as a motherly figure and have her take the primary spot of female influence, it was my grandma who was that for me. \n\nFrom the ages of about 11 to 20 my relationship with my stepmom was the worst. She (and my dad) tried to reduce my access to my grandma in order for me to form the bond with her that they wanted me to have and I resented them for it. My relationship with my dad never recovered. She did apologize for it when she realized that even as an adult I would turn to grandma and that all her efforts to make us closer, to be a mother to me, had pushed me away because I allowed contact to all but end. It didn't make me love her and it didn't make me closer to her exactly. But I appreciated that she had been trying to do what she thought was best and healthiest, even if it was something that I didn't like. I also appreciate that I was more distant with her than most would think of as normal. And that I never did give her a chance to be more to me than she is.\n\nWe have contact, her, my dad and me. But I am still not close to them. I am engaged to my wonderful fianc\u00e9e and we are getting married in November. I asked my grandma if she would want to do a dance with me, in place of a mother son dance, to honor what she has been to me but also to honor my mom. She said yes and even picked the most amazing song for it. My other grandmother, dad's mom, knows what has been going on and joked on Facebook that I'd need to take dance lessons if I go through two spotlight dances. My dad and stepmom saw this and inquired and found out I was dancing with my grandma. This led to them saying I should be doing one with my stepmom too. Dad was more pushy, stepmom was more hopeful that I would be willing.

I have math 3 days a week and after class a group of us grabs lunch and coffee and sits down in the library to do homework together. Honestly it's just as much a social thing as it is academic and it's a lot of fun. \n\nA month into the semester, a 10 year old girl joined the class. She's a genius and apparently high school math was too easy for her so she's taking math and biology here. As smart as she is, she's still a little kid. She has a princess backpack and lunchbox and her backpack has more toys than books.\n\nHer nanny was constantly late to pick her up and she can't check herself into the campus daycare so someone invited her to join the study group. I'm not a kid person. Being in the same class as one is weird enough but I'm not going to get coffee (or in her case, a juice box) and hang out with one. \n\nI went to study group when she was there once and it was just weird. The whole mood is different. She joins the group on Mondays and Wednesdays so I said that I have to work early on those days and do homework at home. Then on Fridays I joined the group and it's like the baby genius doesn't exist. \n\nThen on Friday she asked if she could join us. Her nanny called in sick so she had to wait on campus until her mom could pick her up. The group said yes so I started to leave. Someone asked where I was going so I said I got called in to work early. Well, that made them figure it out and I got texts from half the group asking if I'm seriously skipping the group because there's a kid there and all calling me immature and saying I hurt baby genius's feelings by not wanting to go to group when she's there. \n\nI told my mom about it and she agrees that it's stupid and immature to miss study group just because there's a kid there.

The friend in question is someone I met online, however I have known them for at least 4 years now and they're closer to me than any IRL friends I would have.  \n\n\nThe other day I had decided to finally put together a new frame and boxspring for my bed, as after my previous boxspring broke I'd been just laying on a mattress and nothing else. So I got to putting it together.  \n\n\nAfter about an hour of bringing the boxes with the box spring and frame up the stairs to my room all by myself, moving said boxes and my mattress around in the tight space my bed goes, and getting it all actually built, I was finished, sore as hell and exhausted.  \n\n\nI decided to message my friend about it in hopes of starting some kind of conversation about it, since I wanted to just vibe after all of that since my arms were burning.  \n\n\n2 minutes after I sent the messages, they sent a picture of Destiny 2 as well as excited text. Me, being both exhausted and not knowing really anything about Destiny 2, briefly skimmed over the picture that showed they beat a raid within the first 48 hours of release. I saw \"NEOMUNA\" written in big bold letters and thought \"oh hey it's Nemona\", like from pokemon since we're both big pokemon fans.  \n\n\nThey didn't take kindly to this. I explained I had just spent the past hour building a bed, in which they responded they \"spent the last 30 hours doing THIS\", which again, not knowing much about Destiny, and being exhausted in the moment, I didn't understand what that meant. I could tell they were mad so after trying to explain a bit more I tried winding down the situation, but they stopped messaging me until the next day.  \n\n\nI'll just sum up the argument that happened the next day. They said that I didn't acknowledge the accomplishment, and they said that this was 8 years in the making, but was vague about what that meant (it was referring to how they'd been trying to day one complete a new raid for the past 8 years, but that wasn't obvious).  \nThey said that maybe I'd realize this meant more to them than I thought because of that, despite the fact they never mentioned how long they'd been trying to do this until now so I couldn't've known.  \n\n\nThe whole time it feels like they're ignoring the fact I had literally just physically exhausted myself when they sent the message. And the whole time I'm trying to explain my side and de-escalate the situation.  \n\n\n  \nSo.. AITA? I know I didn't fully acknowledge this accomplishment that means a lot to them in the moment, and that really hurt them. But in the moment, I was exhausted from moving heavy things around and since I don't actively think about Destiny like they do, I didn't put two and two together. As well as the fact they never told me how long they'd been trying to do this. And they just dipped out of conversation instead of explaining anything.  \n\n\nI completely understand if this gets removed, I just need some outside input.","upvote_ratio":0.43,"created_utc":1678645303.0},{"title":"AITA for inviting my roommates bf over","author":"Anxi0u5_Babe","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/11p54ov\/aita_for_inviting_my_roommates_bf_over\/","text":"I (21F) have been roommates with \u201cJane\u201d (19F) for 6 months now.

I run a YouTube channel where I make art, play video games, and talk about cartoons and anime. I try to use my platform to spread fun and positivity, while also raising awareness for issues I feel are important, and have always been against bullying. However, this is one of those situations where I feel the bullying to be earned. I cross promote on my Twitter, and also share my art and comics there too. I do commissions, and talk to potential collab partners, and my Twitter is essentially a part of my YouTube channel at this point. That part of my channel has been stollen.\n\nI received a set of emails within the span of minutes from Twitter saying that someone had logged into my account from Manhattan NY(I'm in Indiana), from an iPhone device (I only use Android), and had changed my password and email on my account. Now, fortunately that email is not the same one I use for YouTube, and I didn't have any personal or billing information linked to my Twitter, but they are now changing my account and using it to try to scam people on Twitter. I've contacted Twitter support staff, but so far have only gotten a single automated response email. In the meantime, they are now impersonating me and using my account to scam people, something I've always condemned. I don't want to just flag the new posts they're making, because it could potentially cause my entire account to be taken down permanently, but I can't just sit and do nothing.\n\nI want to make a video about what happened, so I can get support with raising a stink to get them off my account. I'm not a big channel, by any means, definitely not big enough to be called an influencer, but I've worked hard to build the community I have, and I have no intention of letting some entitled prick steal that away from me.\n\nThe question is, would I be wrong to do this? Cyber bullying is a serious issue, and not something I would normally condone in ANY social setting. But I am pissed off. WIBTA?\n\nEdit: There seems to be some confusion as to the purpose of this post. The reason I posted was not to talk about my channel. If it was, I would have given more detail about my videos and content, and honestly it probably wouldn't be interesting to people who read these kinds of subs in the first place. I posted because I want to get non-biased opinions before telling people to go harass someone on the internet. It's my account, which is why I feel it should be fine, but intentionally sending people to do so could still make me the A, so I was looking for advice on if I should or not before I potentially do something really bad. I only talked about what I felt was necessary to give the full picture. I was also trying to keep it short, because I 1) injured my hand recently and am having to type this all with one hand, 2) am tired because all the drama is making it hard to sleep (which also makes me question my judgement on this one) so I just wanted to get it out and get people's opinions, and 3) this whole situation already has my anxiety and ADD working overdrive as it is. Yes, I posted a link to my hacked Twitter in the comments, but that was only so that people could see what they're doing to my account for the added context of if it would be worth it for me to ask people to harass them.

Our apt and floor happen to be made up of a predominantly Asian demographic (including myself) but our floor is mostly Indian families. (This is important later I swear it\u2019s not racist) and the complex is run by white people. It\u2019s also in a relatively rich area as well because of big tech, so the apartments have a sort of \u201celevated\u201d luxury feel to them.\n\nA few months ago a neighbor moved in about 5 doors down from us. These neighbors  constantly leave their door open to the interior of the apartment hall whenever they\u2019re cooking. Now don\u2019t get me wrong I don\u2019t mind smelling the aroma of food cooking; but our hallways are enclosed\/inside not like those open hallways you see in warmer climates. The smells absolutely flood the hallways and I love Indian food, but sometimes it\u2019s a bit overwhelming to smell it AND smell like it all the time.\n\nTheir unit is also directly across from the elevators & stairwell. It\u2019s very awkward to walk past their unit all the time with the door swung open like that, whenever I come & go from my own unit, or when I\u2019m waiting for the elevator and their kid is just staring at me from the kitchen island. All of the units on this floor have balconies\/windows to the outside so I\u2019m confused as to why they open theirs to the interior. They\u2019ve also set the _entire building_ fire alarms off, rather than their own unit ones, a few times because of them keeping their door propped open when they cook.\n\n_I have no idea if other neighbors have complained or if this is a cultural thing & we just have to deal with it & respect it since we chose to live here._\n\nI just find it a bit odd and sort of rude to the surrounding neighbors to subject us to that. If we *ALL* did it, the entire floor would just smell like food all the time, we\u2019d hear everyone\u2019s TVs, conversations etc.\n\nWIBTA if asked them to close their door - or if I went to the building admin to complain? I just don\u2019t want to seem racist. If anyone other neighbor did this I would also be bothered by it, but no one else does.\n\nEdit: Typos.

T was there for the birth through the first month. From the beginning I told him we would not be cosleeping because I didn\u2019t want to have to deal with it when he left. Well, he didn\u2019t freaking listen and it took me many, many, many months to finally get him to sleep in his crib. When our son was about 7 months, T took him to visit his family for a week. Upon returning our son had fallen back into needing to cosleep and I had to get back to sleeping in his crib. Now I have gotten out of the military and moved for a job. Our sons was sleeping through the night, in his own crib, being a wonderful independent little dude. T took him for a week again and just completely diminished everything. He wants to be held 24\/7. Refuses to sleep in his crib. Literally throws a tantrum whenever I say no. I now live in an apartment which makes it harder to get him on a schedule because I have to be mindful of the neighbors.

I am not opposed to him getting him for longer periods of time, as long as he actually does some parenting and not just let\u2019s our son do whatever he wants. Yes, his family does spoil him. They give him whatever he wants and are always holding him. Telling him no isn\u2019t going to hurt him.\n\nEdit 3: I\u2019m not saying his not a good dad when he\u2019s around.

Just went on what I thought was a horrible date tonight and things ended oddly. I (31M) went out to dinner with Allie (28F) tonight. We\u2019ve hooked up various times over the last 8 years and have never dated, it\u2019s always been causal. I\u2019m recently single after a long term relationship and we reconnected and went out tonight. When we sat down at dinner tonight she asked me something like \u201cHow has your love life been?\u201d I basically told her I\u2019m single for a few months and grateful. She asked why and I more or less told her my ex has BPD and an eating disorder and I\u2019m just happy I\u2019m not with her. \n\nShe then tells me I\u2019m being critical of my ex and maybe I\u2019m the one with the eating disorder (in no way is this a thing at all this is literally a non issue for me ). I basically told her I didn\u2019t want to keep talking about my ex and wanted to enjoy the dinner and she wouldn\u2019t drop it (this went on for another 10 minutes of her berating me). The food came and we didn\u2019t speak for the rest of the meal. I paid and we walked back to the car and I didn\u2019t say a word to her (I walked maybe 5-10 feet ahead of her the whole way back). \n\nAs we walked up to the garage she said something like \u201cWhat are you just going to run off?\u201d when we had just walked 3 blocks and left the restaurant together.

She recently moved about 500 miles from where most of her family lives. Many people (her husband included) questioned this decision as they have a young child, were planning on having a 2nd child soon, & it's good to have family around for support.\n\nShe's now pregnant with her 2nd child & has asked her retired mom to stay with her from the final month before her due date to until she has the baby. Her mom has agreed to do this; however, she can't make it out there until 3 weeks before the due date. Rather than being satisfied with this arrangement, S wants my GF to go out there for the 1 earlier week. Would this be a kind thing for my GF to do? Absolutely, & my GF is, if anything, kind to a fault. While she would rather not go, my GF would never refuse & S knows this.\n\nBut I think it's unreasonable for S to ask her to do this for the following reasons:\n\n1. We have 2 kids of our own & a dog. I work nights 10 or 11 hour shifts. Given my schedule I can't see them off to school in the morning & I won't be there when they get home. Instead, the plan is for my own parents (who are older & retired) to get up at 6:30 in the morning to get them ready for school, be there when they get home, pick them up & drop them off from activities, make them dinner, etc. & also take care of the dog while I'm at work.\n2. My GF will have to drive \\~16 hours (there & back) in our aging, not entirely reliable car. Gas costs money too.\n3. This is all happening so S can have someone there 3-4 weeks before the baby is due. Sure, it's possible she'll go into labor that early, but unlikely.\n4. S isn't alone. Her husband is there. She, understandably, wants her husband to be at the hospital with her, but doesn't have a babysitter lined up. While I'm sure moral support is part of it, S claims the reason she \"needs\" my GF out there is to provide childcare while she's in the hospital.\n\nIn short, after moving away from her family support network against everyone's advice, S now wants the support system to come to her so she can have a free babysitter at the ready in the event she goes into labor 3-4 weeks early. (By the way, my GF & I lived far from family when we had both our kids. For what it's worth, we didn't ask her to help us out then & she didn't offer.)\n\nRather than inconvenience 6 people (my GF, my children, my parents, me) I think S should spend a couple days finding & vetting a babysitter or 2 to be on call in the event she goes into labor that week. She could probably manage that in less time than it would take for my GF just to drive out there. In the event something happens where S truly needs a hand, my GF could still be there in 8 or so hours, but rather than preemptively inconveniencing everyone, let's cross that bridge in the unlikely event it actually materializes\n\nSo now the question: AITA for saying my GF should not go & should suggest that S lines up a babysitter instead.","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1678587727.0},{"title":"AITA for not picking my boyfriends call?","author":"Subject_Lynx_8219","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/11pbi7u\/aita_for_not_picking_my_boyfriends_call\/","text":"My boyfriend runs a business, he asked me to work for him 2 years ago as he needed a helping hand and I agreed. \nWe\u2019ve been dating for around 2.5 years and have known each other for nearly 10 years now.

I love all animals, including cats, so I was psyched. I made a place for the litter box in the bathroom, which is connected to our shared bedroom. I knew that the litter box might smell, but it was worse than I expected. I've resorted to rotating a glade plug-in air freshener between our bedroom and bathroom. When it gets really bad I ask Jane to scoop out the poop. She responds with \"I scooped recently though\". I tell her it smells, and she relents. \nTwo days ago I reached my stink limit again. I asked her to scoop it and was met with the usual response of \"but I did it recently\". I told her that it was stinky and she needed to clean it, especially since she had a friend over. 8 hours passed and no cleaning took place. Once her friend went to bed on the couch, around midnight, I had to say something. After some mild protests, she finally agreed to do it. I knew I was annoying her, so I said \"Sorry for being such a bother\". She responded with \"Well, being aware that you're being nitpicky is what's important\". I took a minute to take in what she just said before getting the courage to say, \"Um, I actually don't think I'm being nitpicky\". She stared daggers at me. I continued: \"I don't think I'm being unreasonable\". The rest of the conversation went like this: \n\nJane: Most people only scoop once a week\nMe: What? No way, that's gross\nJane: I swear, that's what's normal. That's what everyone does.\nMe: *researches how often you should scoop your cat's litterbox* It says here that you should do it twice a day.\nJane: That's just one of those unreasonable standards that no one actually holds themselves to. No one with a life scoops twice a day. The only people who would have time to do that are stay-at-home moms.\nMe: I think it would be easy for any full time worker to clean it twice: once in the morning, once at night.\nJane: *no response* (I think)\nMe: It's also not healthy for the cats. A dirty litterbox increases the chance of disease. Also, cat's don't like it dirty. It said in the article that if they scratch the area around the litterbox it means it's too dirty for them, and I've seen your cats do that.\nJane: *venomous looks* \n\nI think that's where the conversation ended. Since then, we've barely talked. \n\nSome things to note:\n- I have a slightly below average sense of smell\n- Jane has a virtually nonexistent sense of smell (She literally does not know what pee or poop smells like. Or rotten food. Or fish. Or flowers)\n- at the time of surpassing my stink tolerance, the litterbox was full of exposed poop\n- I would scoop it myself, but in the past Jane has gotten angry at me for cleaning up her messes \n\nI know I was kinda rude, but I really think I deserve to have a living space that doesn't stink.

I am aware but also already know what will happen as I grew up in such environment where having your own bedroom is somewhat a lilttle luxury, not to mention our house is quite small)  \n\n\nBut then I was wrong. When COVID hits, I was sent back home by my uni and had to continue my study remotely. So I've been in the house since march of 2020 until now (i've graduated and now WFH). Throughout the years, we found a lot of differences that lead to arguments when it comes to sharing bedroom. For example, I have a routine due to college and work, so I always sleep early, but she doesn't, and I keep it to myself whenever I have trouble sleeping because she'd be noisy calling her friends or watching shows until past midnight. And then there's also a problem with AC. I am prone to cold, I can't stand cold rooms otherwise my nose will get stuffy, but when I express my concern, she said I have to get used to it because she won't be having the room warm if she's in there. and a lot of bantering here and there about where to place my stuff vs her stuff, etc.\n\nI finally asked her the real reason behind merging the bedroom, she said other than wanting a bigger room for herself, she wasn't expecting me to go back staying at the house after I finished college, she was hoping I was never gonna go back to live with my parents and continue living outside the city for the rest of my life. I told her even if that happened, why can't I keep the room, what if something had happened to me and I eventually had to come back and she just hit me back with \"whatever, you shouldn't have come back and get a job somewhere so you don't have to live here\". \n\nI think what's finally getting on my nerve is that, recently I have been trying to get her to agree with separating the room like it was before, but she keeps refusing because \"it was a pain in the ass arguing with dad just to get him merge the room, I don't want my effort going thru fights with dad go to waste\".\n\nidk what to do now because there's really no other room I can use in the house even if I want to just have my own bedroom.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678602375.0},{"title":"AITA for holding my husband to a high standard?","author":"lmdg0917","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/11orc54\/aita_for_holding_my_husband_to_a_high_standard\/","text":"My husband and I (34 y\/o) have been together for 14 years, married for 7.

Well fast forward to a couple hours later, as soon as we sit at the table my mil starts bashing me for what I was wearing she went on to tell me that I should feel embarrassed and ashamed for what I had on when her husband got home. I then went on to tell her that it was my yard and I have a right to wear what I want or what I\u2019m comfortable in without feeling ashamed for it and that I will continue to do it whether she liked it or not. I then got up and took my daughter home with me. When my husband got home he proceeded to tell me that I took things to far and she\u2019s a very conservative woman and he feels I could use the advice she gave me. I feel bad but I\u2019m also going to stand my ground. AITA?                     \n\n\nI should\u2019ve added to this hours ago but I\u2019m making this a PSA. My in laws do not babysit my daughter ever, mainly because we all work on top of that is NOT a reason we ever decided to move in next door. Me and my husband were living two states away up until about 4 months ago. My family has nothing to do with me considering I cut them off because they are all incredibly abusive and toxic. Me and my husband are both an only child and we wanted our daughter to have family in her life outside of just us. It was a mutual decision we all made to move in next door when the house was put up for sale. I have gotten more slander in my comments about how young me and my husband both are to be married with a child. But I can assure you she is well taken care of. Meanwhile over 90% of the people in my comments fail to realize that their grandparents were married and having babies at 14\/15 years old. I posted this to get advice, not to be criticized about my age and capabilities to parent. Thank you to everyone who actually set that aside and gave me good advice on the situation but please consider other aspects on a situation before you comment something like \u201c babies having babies\u201d my daughter is very much loved and well taken care of","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1678497137.0},{"title":"AITA if I don\u2019t pick up my maid of honor from the airport","author":"eye-ham-stew-bid","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/11p5dho\/aita_if_i_dont_pick_up_my_maid_of_honor_from_the\/","text":"My MOH is from out of state.

One who is a bit over 2 years old and another that is 5 months old. I work Monday to Friday 9-5 from home, occasionally go in to the office. My wife is on maternity leave and taking care of the 5 month old. I take care of the baby for over night wakings and feedings.\n\nThe 2 year old is in daycare. Whether I send my kid to daycare 1 day or 5 days a week for 1 hour or 8 it costs the same. My wife likes to pick up our toddler from daycare around 3:15 everyday instead of letting me go when I finish work because she doesn't want our kid to be there so much during the day. The problem is I am left watching the baby for the 45 minutes while she is gone and then for the hour that she is taking care of both of them she gets overwhelmed, stressed, very annoyed at me and our kids, it's just not great overall.\n\nEvery day my wife tells me that she is exhausted, she has no time to herself she doesn't get things done that she needs to, she's overwhelmed, just wants to relax when the baby naps etc... I try to help out with the baby during the day when I can, like feeding and putting him down during my lunch break. I just try to be available throughout the day if my wife needs me.\n\nAnyways, on to the main point of this post. Last night my wife tells me she wants to keep the toddler home from daycare today. I told her that I didn't think it was a good idea. How was she going to feed and put the baby down for a nap while taking care of toddler? She already gets stressed and overwhelmed just looking after the baby. Why put herself through more stress? I told her that I could not take the day off of work and she would be alone taking care of both kids. She said she really wanted to spend time with both kids and felt like she doesn't see our toddler enough. Fine, no problem, if she wants to do this it is up to her, I reiterated that I would not be around to help.\n\nCut to this morning, I got up at midnight and 4 am to take care of the baby. I get both kids ready and made breakfast for everyone.\n\nI start work and sure enough, 20 minutes after I started, I hear my wife trying to tell our toddler that she just needs to go in the other room to put the baby down for a nap. Of course the toddler doesn't want to leave her side, toddler starts crying. I can hear my wife getting frustrated. Wife finally leaves to put baby down and comes back. She now has to juggle going back and forth trying to settle the baby by putting the pacifier back in (we are starting some sleep training) and the toddler who wants all of her attention.\n\nFinally baby gets settled, wife is obviously stressed and tired and it is 9:45am... She comes in to my office where I am working and asks did I not hear her struggling? Why did I not come and help.\n\nAITA for telling my wife I told you so, that I said I would not be around to help and this is what you get?

My siblings are the biggest reason why I\u2019m moving out ASAP. I tell close friends that I can\u2019t handle them and that I can\u2019t really honestly say I love them. I always get told that \u201cthey\u2019re your siblings and they\u2019re supposed to annoy you\u201d or \u201coh don\u2019t say that, of course you love them!\u201d But I love my older siblings, and how I feel about my younger siblings is not the same.\n\nThey\u2019re messy and dependent. I share a bathroom with 2 of my siblings, and I\u2019m constantly cleaning in there. It gets absolutely disgusting, and I seem to be the only one who feels that way. There\u2019s tissues and trash on every surface except the trash can that\u2019s literally like 2 feet away. There\u2019s constantly clothes on the floor from showers, and there\u2019s always toothpaste or hair in the sink (which I will admit, the toothpaste\/hair thing is picky and I\u2019m responsible for that mess sometimes, but I clean it up when I notice it.) I\u2019ve tried and tried to ask them to clean up after themselves, but they just make the same mess the next day. I\u2019m tired of cleaning it up for them or reminding them daily. I was recently gone for about a week, no one cleaned the bathroom while I was gone. When I asked why, I got asked \u201cwhat do you mean?\u201d They usually don\u2019t clean their messes and they\u2019re chores are done poorly.\n\nThey\u2019re disrespectful to my property\/privacy. Recently, I \u201clost\u201d a camera of mine. It was an old video camera that recorded a lot of memories. I hadn\u2019t recorded anything on it in a long time. Turns out one of my siblings had taken the camera from my room while I wasn\u2019t home, and recorded a bunch of random stuff (not a big deal if they had just asked.) but they planned to BURY the camera because I \u201cobviously didn\u2019t need it anymore, because it wasn\u2019t being used.\u201d (I got the camera back, but that\u2019s just one example of them taking my things.) Siblings also unlock locked doors if they want to get in and I won\u2019t open it.\n\nThese behaviors seem (to me) very immature for their age. They\u2019ve done things like this since forever, but I used to write it off as them being young and annoying siblings (I know I bothered my older siblings big time, but my younger siblings are way older than I was when I stopped being a brat.) So I say that I don\u2019t like them or I wish I didn\u2019t live with them. I have NEVER said to my siblings faces that I don\u2019t love them, I can\u2019t imagine how bad that would hurt if my siblings said that to me. I usually just keep my distance from them but I can\u2019t take it anymore. They\u2019re driving me insane, they get away with so much and everyone tells me it\u2019s normal and I should suck it up.

They get into it a bit, I would\u2019ve just gave the $10 but literally had no cash on me. That\u2019s fine. The moment he walks in, he puts his bags down, takes out a thc vape pen and smokes it over my babies play pen with her in it. I immediately grab her, take her away and outside. Was this an overreaction? Maybe. I\u2019m not super morally opposed to people who smoke or anything, just didn\u2019t wanna chance my baby being around it. I explain to my cousin how he can\u2019t do that, but later on in the week I constantly find the weed pen around the house, on the couch and so forth where any one of my children can just grab it. I repeatedly tell him you can\u2019t leave it around, he persist there\u2019s nothing in there to which I always respond \u201cif there\u2019s nothing in there then why not just throw it away?\u201d\n\nOkay that\u2019s fine. Financially I\u2019m not the best at the moment, so at times my cousin will use his EBT to pay for groceries and do, so he\u2019s not being a total free loader. He freely volunteered this and I greatly appreciated it. A week goes by, and I\u2019m getting more and more uncomfortable with him around. Something about him just doesn\u2019t mesh well with me, a certain darkness if you will but that\u2019s another story for another time. A week goes by and I go upstairs into my daughters toy room where he\u2019s been sleeping. What do I find ? A half eaten pill right on top of my daughters toy kitchen, easily accessible for her to get to. After that I decided that he had to leave. Earlier that day I found the weed vape once again on the couch where my kids can get it, and now there\u2019s open pills where my kids can just walk in and take. \n\nKeep in mind, my daughter is 2. This is her toy room, which she was going in and out of (despite my protest but toddlers lol) while my cousin was here. Door wasn\u2019t locked or anything and I decided that him being around, he just wasn\u2019t used to small kids.\n\nSo instead of telling him this like a mature adult, I made up that my in laws had to stay here and told him he had to leave. He packed his bags very angrily and complained about not having anywhere to go. \n\nWe got into an argument since then but that\u2019s another story for another time. \n\nI know ITA because I should\u2019ve just told him maturely","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1678552477.0},{"title":"AITA for refusing to let my parents (who are drinking and high) use my car to go to the casino?","author":"SuckMyHDD","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/11ozlko\/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_parents_who_are\/","text":"They have their own brand new SUV, but the AC in it is broken somehow.

We've been close friends for quite some time and I never begrudge anyone drinking (I don't do it myself but that's just due to me having stomach issues and alcohol just exacerbates it). The issue is that my housemate can never just have 1 or 2 drinks, he has to get to the point where he's falling around\/stumbling around and barely coherent.\n\nLately, things have been getting worse. He used to just drink on a Friday night to \"take the edge off\", which is understandable and I used to just go up to bed whenever he got too drunk as I couldn't be bothered dealing with him when he's in that state (he can get a bit...I wouldn't say verbally aggressive, but he just keeps telling me to \"F off\" and that I \"always have something to complain about\" so to avoid any further confrontation, I would just leave and go to bed. About 2 years ago, we got a dog together which has been great and for the first year or so, he reduced his drinking habits almost entirely with the odd spell here and there but within the past 2 or 3 months, he's been drinking fairly heavily- not quite \"alcoholic\" level I don't think though I'm not sure how it's medically quantified to become alcoholism but he essentially drinks on the first day he's off now and the pattern is usually \"drink, hangover day, drink again on the third\" if that makes sense.\n\nThe reason I bring up the dog is that with his extra drinking, the dog sleeps with me on those nights when she usually sleeps with him (we agreed that when we stopped living together, the dog would go with him anyways). When she's sleeping with me, she is constantly being woken up by him banging around and making loud noises from falling around the place (to which I'm also worried about the neighbours being woken up by). Due to all this, I'm now starting to have second thoughts about letting her go with him when I leave after graduating from university.

I have a history of really bad cramping and heavy periods so I\u2019m expecting to be in bed most of the rest of the day. If it\u2019s not a problem than great! But the procedure itself is still a big deal to me and it took a while to convince myself to do it. \n\nI scheduled the appointment today and then I told my boyfriend about it and asked if he could be with me friday evening and not make any other plans because it would be nice knowing he was there when I get back to take care of me\/comfort me (we don\u2019t live together). He was like \u201cyeah ok\u201d. \n \nThis evening we went to a movie night that his friend was hosting. Usually his friends do movie nights anywhere from 2-3 times a month and he goes to most of them and I go to half or so. So it\u2019s not a rare thing. Tonight his friends brought up the plans for next week and my boyfriend said he would be there and he was excited to go. \n\nWhen we left I reminded him that I had my IUD insertion next Friday and that it would be really nice and make me feel better to have him there with me that evening (if he went to the movie night he wouldn\u2019t come over until probably 1am versus 4pm or so which would be right after I get back). In response he said he\u2019d spend all day Saturday with me but that he doesn\u2019t want to say no to plans just to be at home with me and that I\u2019m holding him back. \n\nI rarely ask him to adjust his plans for me. I really don\u2019t like asking people for things. He had food poisoning a few weeks ago and I spent pretty much the whole weekend at his place taking care of him. So I guess it just makes me feel kinda unimportant like he will be with me until something better comes up. I\u2019m also upset because I\u2019m partially getting the IUD so that we don\u2019t have to worry about me getting pregnant. Now I feel like I\u2019m asking too much of him and I wish I had never asked because I\u2019m sad that he isn\u2019t willing to sacrifice one night of his social life for me. I don\u2019t really care what he does the rest of the weekend, it would just make me feel better if he was with me the day of.\n\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nThank you for the support everyone. It\u2019s given me a lot to think about, I have trouble asking for my needs to be met and most everyone provided good blunt advice even if I don\u2019t want to hear it. This is my first long term relationship so I don\u2019t really have anything to compare it to. \n\nFor all the people saying not to get the IUD because he\u2019s not being supportive, I mentioned this in the comments but just want to mention again: The primary reason I am getting the IUD is because without hormonal birth control I am quite literally bedridden during my period. Hormonal birth control allows me to take control of my life and has helped tremendously in minimizing pain and heavy bleeding. So I would be getting it even if I wasn\u2019t having sex. I think it\u2019s important to remember that lots of people need hormonal birth control for pain management, it\u2019s not just for pregnancy protection! :) I am on birth control pills but I can no longer be on them because the estrogen interacts with a mood stabilizer I recently started taking for my anxiety.

The roommate who lives beside my room, let\u2019s call her Jenny, has been making my life and my other 6 roommates lives stressful \n\nFirst of all, Jenny shouts all the time, they can\u2019t keep a quiet voice and especially when they have a friend\/friends over I can hear them in the kitchen and especially when they\u2019re in the room next to me. \n\nThe second problem is that I have lost count the amount of times they have had houseparties and people over for drinks. It caused me and my other roommates stress knowing that this roommate is going to invite people over to drink as we know this will mean shouting, multiple guys shouting, and her shouting and banging doors. This roommate never ever asks our six other roommates is it okay if she invites peoples over. It\u2019s disruptive to our lives as they drink in the kitchen, the kitchen is covered in drink bottles and it\u2019s impossible to cook food and eat dinner when there\u2019s that much people drinking in our kitchen. The other downside to having people in our apartment over is that whenever they go out to the clubs, they come home late at night and cause chaos and noise and wakes people up at all hours of the night when this roommate is aware we all have college the next morning . \n\nThe third problem is that she has an awful, misogynistic and toxic ex boyfriend that is constantly in the apartment. The roommate whose  bedroom is on the other side of Jenny\u2019s room, let\u2019s call her Mary, also suffers when Jenny brings her ex over. This guy has multiple times shouted awful things at Jenny, and Jenny had openly admitted to anyone she ever meets that this guy is toxic and treats her like shit. This guy also does not have an indoor voice and myself and Mary cannot sleep or get work done when this guy is in Jennys room as he constant shouts. This guy has been kicked out twice out of our apartment, but Jenny still invited him over, even though me and 6 of my roommates have expressed to her that we do not like him and that he is too loud. \n\nThe third problem, I have heard Jenny doing the deed 3 times. The first time I was honest with her and said I could hear them doing it. She did not apologise, she didn\u2019t even seem embarrassed. It seemed like she was proud that someone heard her doing the deed. \n\nJenny clearly has no respect or consideration for the rest of us living in the apartment. She is aware that her ex is banned yet still invites him over, she is aware that the Walls are paper thin and that everyone can hear everything. The problem is that if one of us reports her, she will figure out who it was, and we would have to face serious consequences with her. We would still have to live with Jenny for another 3 months and none of us want a hostile environment in the apartment. At this stage, I\u2019m sick of her behaviour and I have lost all respect for her, as she clearly does not respect anyone else\u2019s need for quietness or peace.","upvote_ratio":0.79,"created_utc":1678573426.0},{"title":"AITA for refusing to help this colleague with her schooling unless I get a raise?","author":"anonymouspsaw","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/11o6dkl\/aita_for_refusing_to_help_this_colleague_with_her\/","text":"I (32F) work in a daycare. I recently obtained certification through an online school. Another teacher, let's call her Estelle (probably in her 50s), showed great interest. The thing is, it's a lot of work. The certification is pretty much self-directed and then you have to fill out a ton of paperwork, take an extensive exam and then be evaluated as a teacher. It took me well over a year to obtain mine and it was a huge pain in the ass. I explained this to Estelle and she was on board. I thought that was the end of it.\n\nThen my boss, \"Adrian\" approached me and asked if I could help Estelle enroll as she wasn't familiar with the website. I agreed and we got her signed up. Both Adrian and I stressed that it is a very intensive process and she'll have to do a lot of work. The classes are non-refundable. Estelle said yes, yes, that's fine. She paid for everything.\n\nEstelle approached me today and asked if I could help her order the materials needed. I found this a little weird as the website is pretty self explanitory and there's a big tab that says \"store\" where you order them. But okay, I was still willing to help. We get this done and that's when Estelle started asking me the same questions about the course that I already answered. She still didn't seem to get this is a *self-directed* program. They have an administrator that looks over your work, but it's on you to read the book, do the work and submit it. There are no classes to attend. \n\nLater on, she approached me again and asked if I could help her with the assignments, study, etc. I was clearly hesitant and she said \"Adrian told me you would help. I only signed up for all of this because she promised you'd help me type things up\". \n\nI went to Adrian who claimed \"it's not a lot of work\" and \"just help her out\". I asked if this came with a raise and she said no, as I'd be doing all of this off the clock. I said I'm not a teacher or administrator, I'm not doing this. Adrian wasn't happy but there's nothing legally she can do.\n\nEstelle is very upset and frantic. She says she can't do this by herself, why can't I just help her? She already sunk a lot of money into this. Some of our colleagues are on her side. They say I'm being unfair and it's not fair to Estelle that Adrian lied to her. They say she can't afford to waste the money and really needs to see this through, but she can't do it alone. The thing is, I'm the only one with this certiifcation at the school (most have a bachelors in the field, so they never did this).

I started recording for like two seconds, but my dad kept telling me to stop recording all while my mom kept telling me to record. I was super lost on what to do, but my brain kept telling me that being included in their argument wasn't right.

At 7 I had a meeting so I told my sisters that we can cut the cake at 9 once I finished. They all agreed, and they knew that my door had to be closed because of the noise.\u00a0  \nWell at 8:30 I heard them singing and my heart dropped and started sobbing. Not a single knock on my door or a call and the worst part of all is that I found out THROUGH THE FAMILY CHAT. I was a mess. A few minutes later I pulled my mom to the side and asked her why didn\u2019t they wait for me, why they had to give my dad the cake without me. She just told me that she was calling me several times, just then YS showed up, I asked her the same and she told me to shut up. I told her that she was in the room next to mine, she could have at least knock but got the same response. Then B showed up and my mom told him to control me cause I was making a fuss over nothing. I just kept crying. I talked to B about how hurt I felt, how I was basically excluded. The cake was my present to my dad, my time and effort in that cake for them to just take it. He just listened to me before apologizing and kept insisting it wasnt intentional, that it all happened so fast and there was no time. he said that I was right to feel angry and sad, that he shouldve done something.I told him that they\u2019re my siblings and they shouldn\u2019t have left me behind, that I won\u2019t forgive any of them for not taking in consideration my time and effort on the cake which was MY PRESENT. While going back upstairs, B (trying to lift up the mood) said that the cake was good to which I said that I didn\u2019t care at all even if it tasted like trash and left.\u00a0  \nAfter that, the rest of the family started leaving. OS came to my room and told me she was leaving and she\u2019s sorry I couldn\u2019t be there but things went as it went. I told her to stop making excuses for her behavior, she kept defending herself so I asked her to leave.  \nUntil now my mom and YS haven\u2019t apologized, and act of nothing happened. Now that calmer I\u2019m thinking maybe I shouldn\u2019t have gone overboard over a cake but my bf and some friends (who know how my family behaves) thinks my reaction is more than appropriate for the way they\u2019ve been treating me. So AITA?  \nBtw my dad was drunk but he did enjoy the cake and he doesn\u2019t know what happened.  \n\ud83d\udcf7**ReplyForward**","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1678555634.0},{"title":"AITA for telling my friend his ex is making fun of him?","author":"Comfortable_Many_406","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/11p3ifx\/aita_for_telling_my_friend_his_ex_is_making_fun\/","text":"I have been friends with this guy, Jace, for 5 years. We used to go to the same school and we are both part of this very tight friend group. I met his ex, Laura, after I switched schools, and became friends with her. They began dating in August last year. They broke up in January this year because Laura was going to study in the UK for a few months. Both of them told me it was a amicable break up and that they were still friends. I am studying abroad in the same city as Laura but in a different school. I invited Laura to lunch and told her to bring some of her friends from her school, bc I was bringing mine. Everything was going great, her friends were really cool up until the point where they started making this comments. Basically making fun of Jace because he is still texting Laura. Laura moved on quickly (whit several people), I didn\u2019t think much about the comments and decided to keep my mouth shut. After the lunch, my friends told me about some nastier comments Laura\u2019s friends had said about jace that I hadn\u2019t heard. I personally think that i would want to know if I was Jace in this situation. So I told Jace\u2019s best friend who is also a very good friend of mine. I didn\u2019t go into much details about the nasty comments bc Jace tends to be insecure,I just wanted him to stop texting her. A few days later I get a text from Laura asking if I said anything to Jace. I then text him asking what he said to Laura. He very rudely told me that the next time I was going to make up and blow up things out of proportion I should make them more believable, and that this was the sort of thing I should have told him myself. I told him that I thought it was better he found out from someone who was physically next to him, than trough a text. And that why would I make up something like that. He kept insulting me and I just told him to fuck off and that I am never going to do something for him again. Now no one in the friend group will talk to me. I talked with one of my shared friends with Laura. She told me that Jace texted  Laura in a similar rude way and told her that he knew she was talking shit about him and that she should think twice about who her friends were. I have no idea what i did wrong. I was initially not going to get involved, but  if my friends who were at the lunch noticed something I couldn\u2019t  keep my mouth shut.

I was married until 2 years ago when I got divorced with my ex. The break up was brutal, and Bob had a very big hand to play in it.\n\nDuring my marriage with my ex (8 years long) Bob was a mutual friend who ALWAYS put me down in front of my wife, but never when we were alone. I tried to view it as banter, but it was fairly relentless, and rude, and oddly was often centred on me being a \"little girl\". He was so disrespectful and lacked social boundaries (turning up unannounced at my house at 10pm, multiple times, for example). He then went on hours long walks with my wife, and during heated arguments with my wife, she disclosed to me that Bob suggested I was abusive. During the separation, Bob took my ex in and comforted her. I then got wind that shortly after, they tried to date, but it didn't work out. This pretty much confirmed to me that Bob was doing all the above (and more) to put me down, get me out of the picture, and to be with my wife.\n\nI told Alice in a recent talk that I'd send a message to Bob to iron out things. She said it's fine.\n\nI wrote and sent to him via messenger:\n\n*Bob,*\n\n*I\u2019m sure you must have heard that Alice and Steven are getting married in August. I\u2019ll definitely be attending the event, and I\u2019m somewhat sure you will be also.

With that in mind, I would like you to interact with me as little as is possible on the day of the event, as insignificant as it may have been. If you do interact with me, you must do so with respect and proper acknowledgment of social boundaries.*\n\n*While it is disappointing that I have to speak of the need of respect and boundaries, you have, somewhat consistently throughout the time I knew you, shown a flagrant disregard for such understandings as a person.

I take the same route, pretty much and today was no different. I was approaching a corner of the street I usually turn down and I\u2019m assuming someone had family over because there were more cars then usual parked along the street and onto the pavement. These cars were half on the pavement with barely enough room to push my pram and definitely not enough room for a wheelchair, for example. Now I was pushing my pram and it was a squeeze between me and the cars but the last car I got stuck and rammed my pram through the gap (couldn\u2019t of been too hard because baby was still asleep after). \n\nNext thing I know I hear \u201coi\u201d so I turned around and this guy must\u2019ve come out of the house and shouted to me that I scratched his car. I walked back and said where (he pointed out some scuffs along his wheel arch) I said well you shouldn\u2019t be parked on the pavement it\u2019s illegal and there must be enough room for wheelchairs, prams ect. He started shouting really aggressively telling me I should pay for the scratches. I said he can\u2019t expect me to push my baby into a busy road because he wants to park on a FOOTpath with emphasis on the foot part. I refused to be shouted at in front of my son so I called him an arsehole and walked off. \n\nI do feel bad for scratching his car. It was a \u201822 plate Kia, I\u2019m assuming brand new. It wasn\u2019t intentional at all, but still, dont park on the pavement! \n\nAnyway I got home and my partner said I could\u2019ve knocked on and asked him to move the car.

All of them were super excited. My family is very close to my husband and has been super involved in our lives. We go on vacation with them every year, see them multiple times throughout the year and they actively check in on us. His family on the other hand is estranged. We see them all once a year (thanksgiving) and it's very awkward every single time. The only reason we are invited is because they want help with funding their feast. They don't like my husband and have been telling me to leave him and save myself since I got together with him (he was severely depressed at that time and had no goals- he's much different now but they still hold it against him years later). \n\nIt's important to note that we had become pregnant years ago and miscarried. None of his family was excited and when they found out we miscarried they said it was \"for the best\". So this time around I truly don't care if they know. I don't care to tell them. I don't like them as people and I certainly don't like how they treat my husband. To be quite frank, I could go my entire life keeping my unborn child from them people and sleep soundly at night. They shit talk my husband to everyone so I guarantee they will do the same to our kid. \n\nSo after we told my family my husband said something about \"now we have to figure out how to tell my family\" (because we did a special announcement to my family with lots of planning). I said \"how about a FB post\". He asked why my family got a special announcement but his doesn't and I said \"we can do a special announcement if you want but I don't see the point because they won't be excited and they will not care, just like the first time around.\" I wasn't trying to be dismissive about it but I guess I kind of am in the same sense because his family aren't good people. And as I said, we can make a special announcement for them but I truly think it's a waste of time and effort. He says he's hurt that I'm so dismissive and maybe a special announcement will help them see he's not the man that he used to be. So he's wants to do it for approval, whereas I think it's a waste.

It can be a little grating because she does it pretty frequently, and sometimes the questions can seem a little off-topic, but it's clear from the way she talks that she's trying very hard to connect with the other people in the class, and it's certainly not something that's worthy of scorn. I'm not sure if she's on the spectrum, and I don't want to make any assumptions, but she reminds me a lot of my sister who's autistic, and at the very least you can tell she struggles a bit to understand social situations and when it may be appropriate to talk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBecause she talks so much in class, a lot of people get annoyed with her. There are two girls in particular who always choose to sit right in the front of the class, in front of the board, and are therefore in everyone's sightline. Every time that Katie talks or asks a question, they turn to each other and are very clearly talking about her. They make loud and obvious facial expressions and hand gestures of exasperation, and it is genuinely distracting because the manner in which they do it is not at all subtle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have noticed this for the past few weeks and it's started to really bother me. There are only about 25 to 30 students in the class, making it very easy to notice their asides to one another. I tend sit in the very back and can still see them very clearly. I am considering saying something to them, because Katie only sits a row back and has most definitely noticed it at this point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo my plan is to sit a little closer to them so maybe I would be able to tell what they're saying to one another, just to make sure I'm not mistaken (though I don't know what else they would be talking about every time that this one particular girls talks), and to say something to them after class. Right now what I'm thinking of saying is something like this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Hey! I just wanted to let you know that whenever Katie talks and you guys turn to each other and make comments, or exchange faces, everyone can see you, and Katie probably has too. So either sit in the back of try keeping it to yourself.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is harsh but I'm struggling with how to make this more polite while getting my point across.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want opinions, though-is this a good idea? I don't know if it will make a difference or if it's even an appropriate thing to bring up; I just get really angry when every time we have a class together, which is 4 times a week, I have to watch their clear shit-talking of her.

When we met I was overweight, not morbidly obese, but I was above what would be considered healthy for a person of my age and build. My girlfriend is also a little overweight but never have I ever looked at her and not thought she was beautiful. \n\nA year and a half ago I decided I wanted to get in shape per say. I told her and she was extremely supportive. I\u2019ve changed my diet and worked out routinely and I\u2019ve managed to lose a good amount of weight. It has made me a lot happier to look in the mirror and not be uncomfortable with my body. \n\nOne of my old friends was in town visiting his family a few days ago and we planned to meet for a lunch together. It was amazing to see him again, but when he saw me he looked me up and down and said \u201cWell well, when did you get skinny?\u201d Those words made me so unbelievably happy and extremely proud that all my hard work is paying off. After the lunch I went to my girlfriend\u2019s house and told her about my friend calling me skinny. I expected her to be excited with me as she knows how much happier I\u2019ve been and she knows I\u2019m finally comfortable with my body. Instead she went crazy. She went on a rant about how she is tired of me talking to her about these things. Her words hurt me so much. I lost my cool and screamed back that at least I\u2019m trying to be healthy. She yelled at me to leave which I did without complaint. \n\nI regret saying what I said but I wish she could be more supportive. I love her so much but she has made me feel as if she doesn\u2019t care about me. AITA?\n\nEdit 1: There have been many questions asked. I was not clear with my words so allow me to clear that up.\n\nI only mention anything related to this subject a couple times a week max, only when I meet a goal I\u2019ve set or I want her to join me. I work out 3 days a week for an hour each time, and I like to give her the option to come with me. I don\u2019t do this because I think she needs it, or I think she is fat. She isn\u2019t. I do it because we started this together and I want her to know that she can come with me anytime, I want her to experience the happiness I\u2019ve experienced through this. If she declines to join me I do not try to force her. I respect her decisions and do not try to get her to change her mind.\n\nMy wording in a reply to somebody\u2019s comment has led people to believe I comment on her weight semi often. I do not. The only time I\u2019ve ever said anything about her weight is when we started this whole thing. We had a conversation about how much weight we were looking to lose and that involved talking about how much we weighed at that time, which I did so in a non offensive manner. She did the same to me and we set each other goals.\n\nIf there\u2019s anything else you would like cleared up comment and I will do my best to either edit this post or reply.\n\nAnyways she has been ignoring my calls which I understand. I decided to send her an apology text where I made sure she knew I was sincere. I asked her to come over tonight so I can talk to her about the situation and make it up to her. She agreed. I\u2019ll update again tomorrow with details about tonight.\n\nUpdate: she left early, but not because of what you may be thinking (reason gets into her private life so forgive me for not saying but I will respect her privacy). It went great. She accepted my apology and delivered one of her own. I obviously accepted as well. Some of you advised me to talk to her about her emotions and thoughts concerning the whole ordeal so I did, and some of you were right on with your assumptions. She did feel a bit ashamed of her body. I reassured her and told her if it makes her feel better I\u2019ll keep my workout\/diet life to myself. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna do. I\u2019m going to use this as an opportunity to learn and understand my girlfriend better. Thank you all for your advice, I will definitely try to remember it.

For some backstory, my child's father (39m) and I (26f) met back in 2020. While we were never in a real relationship, we were friends with benefits. We never had any major issues until now. \n\nFebruary of last year I found out I was pregnant with my first child. Pregnancy was pretty much smooth sailing. Me and him bumped heads mostly about the baby but it was never any major. We always bounced back. \n\nFast forward to 2-3 months after our daughter was born, came the subject of who would file her on their taxes. I said that I would since I wasn't working and could use the extra funds ( I quit my job 2 months before i gave birth because the DM was a complete AH and the stress of it was starting to affect the pregnancy). That became an issue because and I quote....\" you haven't worked long enough to get much back and I make more\" just to clarify, I worked 7 months out the year and worked 2 jobs til I found out I was pregnant. I thought the conversation was done and dropped. Apparently, I was wrong. \n\nJust to clarify some  things, I never asked him to do anything for me. Anything he did was did on his own account. For example, I had caught a flat and asked him to put on the spare and that o would go the next day to get another. He took it upon himself to go and pay for 4 tires.  He would also get mad when I wouldn't ask him for things like money to go out with friends. All I asked was for things for our daughter. I'm very independent and have been this way since forever. If I needed anything, I would try to figure it out on my own or go without. I absolutely hate asking people for any help and I have my reasons. \n\nFast forward again,  taxes dropped and I immediately took care of business. Paid off and paid up some bills and also set money aside for rainey days until I can secure another job. The day this all started, I knew he would be busy, so I offered to buy him something to eat. Apparently I was being too nice and he asked if I had gotten my taxes. I told him I did and what I did with it. \n\nI obviously did something wrong because it started an entire argument as to why I didn't tell him when I got them and it has spiraled out of control and a lot of things have been said out of hurt and angry, mostly on my part. He is now calling me selfish for not thinking of anyone but myself. I have attempted to talk and apologized to keep the peace but apparently I'm just about the money like every other money hungry babymama. \n\nHe is a great dad to our Babygirl and has helped out a lot especially when I'm fighting ppd.

Most of our friends have kids between 4-10y like us (5y & 8y).\n\nFew months back (Jack & Jill) from a cross-department joined us at some of our get-togethers & invariably we landed up at their place. They have a big Dalmatian dog which we didn't know about till then. The dog was kinda all over petrified kids. Anyway, we kind of are ok with dogs & wanted the kids to get used to Dogs rather than getting scared so encouraged them to not mind the dog, pet him and play as usual.\n\nAnyway, the dog was overactive and at some point scratched my younger one with some blood oozing which our hosts attended with some first aid. So all kids are now pretty scared & we can't convince them otherwise. The hosts don't have a separate room to keep the dog and refused to either leash him or put him in the balcony, all the while Jack insisting the scratches are nothing serious and both their dog & kids will get used to each other. The end result was a crappy party with kids almost all the time around us in fear of dog instead of playing with each other. All kids made it clear that they are never coming to this house again if the dog was going to be loose there.\n\nNext few weeks we met at our places. When it was J & J's turn we made it clear that either they leave the dog with some friends\/family\/kennel they use when they go out of town or at the very least leash him, or we can meet outside at some restaurant (as we occasionally do) or no biggies they can just attend & not host. The moment we said this Jill kinda tore into the group that they have no clue that the Dog is like a baby to them & we are insensitive. We tried reasoning a bit with Jack but sensing passive aggressiveness on this topic we ignored it. The next day they sent a WhatsApp saying the next weekend the party is at their place and we replied that we are not comfortable coming unless they leash their dog at least. They replied \"no can do\" & that was that. They skipped some immediate parties that we invited to after that and we moved on with our parties and stopped inviting them after some time sensing the mood.\n\nRecently, we had a new colleague Jen at work who heard of our regular weekend evening plans, so I casually invited her over with family as they were new in town & had kids of similar age. However, she messaged me on Thursday that they won't be able to join. No biggie but odd that she kinda had invited over herself in the first place. Today a colleague told me that it turns out she met Jack for some work in the office and he warned her that our group is big-time Dog Haters and they would be shunted off when we find out that she has a dog so rather not waste time with us.

He is an alcoholic to a dangerous degree, he would always smell of alcohol and for two summers he lost his license and he biked me to daycare before me went to work. All my memories are tainted by the smell of alcohol.  He ended up getting arrested when I was 10 years old and my parents legally got divorced, I was fine with this because he had a hard time with responsibilities and would rather be the \"fun dad\".  This made it hard to visit and get along with my father's side of the family, and I'm very distant with them.\n\nThe reason I'm posting is because we have met on and off since he got out, but every single time I see him he drinks. The last I saw him was 2018 at my wedding, It was hard to enjoy since my father decided to help himself to two bottle of champagne before the ceremony. I haven't seen him recently since he lives so far away but he reaches out to say happy birthday over Facebook. \n\nI don't respond and that's where the issue is, my mom thinks I'm being rude and he wants to be apart of my life, but I'm not sure if he's stopped drinking or not. The latest news I even heard of him is that he was dating a 22 year old, which I find uncomfortable since I'm 25.\n\nI wanted to know if I'm the A for ignoring his Facebook messages and not involving myself with my father even though he is trying to reach out?\n\nEdit: wanted to thanks those who supported me and gave me great advice.

My GF has a cat (2M). He\u2019s mostly well behaved, not destructive and is mostly good company.\n\nThe cat wants to be in our (GF and I) bedroom if she is present in the room at night The cat tries to wedge itself between her and I, and sensually it makes me very uncomfortable. I have sensory issues that I\u2019m good at masking during waking hours but it\u2019s impossible when I want to decompress in the bed after the day is done. I want to clarify that I don\u2019t hate animals\/pets, but I don\u2019t consider myself an animal person. Being able to be comfortable in my own bed is important to me. I\u2019m not used to having an animal on the bed, and after a few months of living through this, I can say that I\u2019m not okay with it. The cat will also run around the bedroom, trying to climb furniture or playing which is also very disruptive when I try to sleep. \n\nI have tried to close the door in order to keep the cat out during sleep. This causes the cat to scratch\/push at the door until my GF lets him in. I can sleep through this scratching if I put on white noise, and I\u2019ll purposely try to increase the volume of the white noise to cancel it out so that it doesn\u2019t cause my girlfriend to wake up and let him in, doing this hasn\u2019t been successful.\n\nThis has been causing sleep deprivation. I communicated that I can\u2019t sleep with the cat in the room, but that I didn\u2019t have a problem with it being in the room if she was in there alone sleeping after a night shift as in such instance I would be awake. My GF thought this to be a fair compromise, and the solution was to install a tall cate gate in the hallway to prevent him from entering the sleeping area at all when I\u2019m asleep. \n\nSince then I\u2019ve been able to finally get the sleep now that I\u2019m comfortable. All noise has stopped as the cat has no way to clear the gate or scratch at anything. However, my GFs mom came over one day, and from my understanding, my GF has been told that my solution was mean, and that I\u2019m \u201cbulling\u201d the cat. Additionally, my GF has communicated that she doesn\u2019t want to keep that gate up forever as she wants the cat to have freedom to go wherever it wants, whenever it wants. \n\nI really don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m being unreasonable about this, I just don\u2019t want it to be in the room when I myself am sleeping, any other time I don\u2019t mind where the cat goes.

My GF means the world to me, and I really feel like there is a strong connection between me and her.

She\u2019s a delicate, dainty kid which obviously isn\u2019t the style of kung fu. She complains and becomes upset if she\u2019s dragged to the basement to practice, and much prefers to ice skate. My sister has been to only 2 competitions in her life while I have been to dozens.\n\nDespite this, she, along with my parents and kung fu coaches, want her to participate in the World Championships. My coaches have crucial connections and have said they can easily sneak her name in, and my parents think this would be great to put on a college app. \n\nI was pretty upset learning about this and told my parents I would stop putting effort into kung fu if I could just be \u201cbackended\u201d onto the team. My sister is angry that I\u2019m not supporting her. They don\u2019t seem to understand that competing against other country reps is a pretty big deal and being \u201ca good thing to put on a college app\u201d doesn\u2019t make this whole thing less corrupt. \n\nOf course I understand that her being there would not impact me in the slightest but I\u2019m still pretty livid that she can be on the US team without the same effort.

A few times a year, my husband (M40) would come out with me to the exciting destinations. My work has a ton of down time so it was a way for us to go vacations we can't afford to do on our own.\n\nWhen the exciting trips pop up, I'm the one that has to arrange a pet sitter and the normal logistics of leaving a house unattended while on vacation. Sometimes I pay for his airfare, sometimes he pays for his own. (We keep our finances separate.)\n\nBut since Covid, my schedule has been somewhat unpredictable. There are last minute changes to cities, changes to dates, changes to the length of the stay, etc. If my husband had planned to come with, that affects his airfare or means he had to cancel his trip entirely. When that happens I would have to deal with weeks of constant bitching about how it is \"unfair\" and how he wanted to go to XYZ and now can't. I understand being disappointed but these are still work trips and I had nothing to do with making the schedule. It has gotten to the point that I just do not want to take him with anywhere because the trips that do happen just aren't worth the weeks of bitching for the ones that don't. I told him this, and explained that if he can't appreciate the fun trips and accept the failed trips, I don't want to take him on any trips at all. But his behavior didn't change and I honestly do not want to take him with on work trips anymore.\n\nWe still go on vacation and road trips so he's not stuck at home 365 days a year; but we can't afford to take the same kind of trips on our own budget.\n\nLast fall he started a grad program and quit his job because he didn't have the time to work full time and concentrate on school. I support this, I want him to work towards on his goals and want to help him achieve them. I make enough money to cover the bills but it requires cutting back on retirement savings, entertainment, and hobbies. \n\nI just got assigned a project in a part of the world he really wants to visit. He wants to get an airline ticket to join me but the roundtrip airfare alone would cost $4,000 plus whatever else he spends while out of the country. (Almost all of my normal travel is on Southwest so I don't have airline points I can use for international travel) He still has some money saved up from before he quit his job but this would pretty much wipe out his savings. I also don't understand how he doesn't have the time to work but has the time to travel half way across the globe. I also know that if the dates change last second or the trip cancels, he will not stop complaining for a long time.\n\nAITA for not giving him dates and information he would need to come with?

My husband is a bird guy. He's raised birds when he was younger. I do not like birds. I am terrified of them. He got our child really excited about birds and they both decided that they wanted to own one. Our child was 10 and this would be their first time interacting with a bird. I told them that I would be fine with them getting one, but that I would not be responsible for the care and upkeep of the bird as again, I hate birds. My husband promised me that he would help our child with the bird and our child promised about as much as a 10 year old can promise to be a responsible pet owner. We ended up getting a love bird. \n\nFast forward two years and I have fought almost every day since the novelty of the bird has worn off to get my child to spend time with it and not neglect it. My husband has helped, but incredibly infrequently. I have had multiple conversations with him about stepping up and he does.... For maybe a day or two. He also will put the bird to bed when our child asks. My child starting feeling incredibly guilty about the bird because it's nippy and not very social and was blaming themselves. I outright told them that it's not their fault. They were a little kid when we got it and their Dad should've been more involved in caring for it. \n\nNow the both of them want a puppy. Our dog recently passed and while I am not ready or even necessarily want a dog right now, I certainly am not going to begrudge my child another dog. However I am EXTREMELY concerned about the bird being even more neglected with the addition of a puppy and the possibility of fighting with our child to take care of the bird and have said it repeatedly to my husband. I have even nicely expressed my thoughts with my child. My concerns have basically been disregarded by my husband. Our child did decide that they weren't really a good caretaker for the bird on their own (which I told them that it was a very brave thing to admit and I was proud of them) and made the decision to surrender the bird. But my husband decided to keep going forward with looking at puppies before we surrendered the bird. He found a puppy and showed pictures of it to our child. They asked me if we could go get it tomorrow and I put my foot down: We're not getting a puppy until we have done the right thing by the pets we do have and surrender the bird. It ended up causing a fight with my husband and he called me a condescending asshole because I basically told him that he was at fault for this whole scenario with the bird and let our kid down.

Before valentines day, my roommate \"Ellie\" lets us know that they're going to be having friends over for a get together and that it shouldn't go too long (something similar to galentines day). My other roommate and I agree that that's ok.\n\nThe friends arrive around 5-6 pm that Monday. I want to say there were about six of them. They start drinking (drinking age here is 21 if that matters to any readers). It's not uncommon for some people to get very loud when drunk. This seems to cover Ellie and all of their friends. There's a lot of shouting, and I play some music with my headphones on, but it's not enough to drown them out. \n\nAround 10:30 pm, they're all in Ellie's room and they're screaming. No shouting, actually just screaming. It's not quite bloody murder volume but it's definitely a headache-inducing volume even with the noise cancelling headphones. After a few minutes of the screaming, I leave my room, stand outside Ellie's door and scream back. It was less than two seconds, but it was loud. They fall silent.\n\nAs for why I didn't ask them to quiet down, I had asked before during Ellie's get-togethers if they could be quieter,  and it never helped. When I had asked friends for advice, they said I should start pushing back. One of them jokingly said \"scream back at them,\" and that struck my exhausted brain as a decent idea.\n\nWhen we all moved in, I learned that my roommates prefer to have their confrontations over text, so I send Ellie a message saying that if they're going to bring people over for underage drinking, the least they could do is be quiet about it. Their reply was that they gave a heads up in the roommate group chat, so we should have expected the noise, and that it was just normal conversation. I told them that screeching is not normal conversation. They responded asking over and over \"Why did you scream at my friends?\" even after I had answered. Their friends started leaving shortly after.\n\nThey asked me if I was going to move out (I had planned to move out months prior but couldn't. I explained this to them twice because they had asked before). They then texted me \"I gave you a warning so you could wear headphones or something, but I guess just can't have friends over.\" I said that they weren't going to bring people over to drink anymore. They apologized and said they wouldn't, but still bring friends over to get drunk on weekdays, just without a warning.\n\nThe next day I apologized to my other roommate in case she was bothered by it, but she said it was fine and she didn't even hear it (Ellie's room is right next to mine while hers is across).\n\nPersonally, I feel like I was justified - if they don't listen when asked to be quieter and they bring a couple people over who then start screaming at 10:30 on a Monday night, I think it's perfectly reasonable to scream back.

I am trying to learn the languages, but it\u2019ll be at least a year before I can fully understand what\u2019s being said, let alone engage in their banter.

I think it\u2019s beautiful and it pushes me to learn more about the languages and the cultures. \n\nHere is my issue:  I am so tired of being invited to outings with them and for 30 minutes at a time, I can\u2019t engage in or even understand what\u2019s being said. It\u2019s different when I\u2019m over at their house for a birthday or a holiday because when they start speaking in their native tongues, I can just go to another room and be on my phone for the next 1.5 hrs while they forget that I\u2019m there. But when it\u2019s the four of us at brunch or something, I find myself battling with the idea of bringing out my phone when they get wrapped up in their conversations for 30 minutes at a time because I don\u2019t want to seem rude (I was raised to not be on my phone during family outings), and end up just staring into the ether until someone realizes I haven\u2019t said a word for the past half hour and goes back to English. \n\nI can\u2019t turn down the family outings because his mom is very sensitive and if I turn down an invite, she begins to think I don\u2019t like her.

She said I was the least pretty of my sisters because I looked like my dads side of the family and as teen I just hated my appearance. She was also extremely racist to my best friend when she came round and it was just awful. I felt on edge in my home for years and my mom would get mad at her but she would just cry about her past and my mom would forgive her.\n\nFast forward to now me and my partner are engaged and very happy, we have our own home, good jobs and I feel the stability and love has helped heal a lot of the trauma I suffered. She still lives with my mom I am polite when I visit but that\u2019s the extent of our relationship. \n\nI had my dress appointment and chose a beautiful dress and actually felt beautiful in it. When I went to visit my mom I was showing her pictures and my mom was complimentary and gushed about the dress my Nan asked to see and I stupidly let her look. She smirked and said a girl with my body type could never pull this dress off and said I best start dieting. \n\nI lost my shit. I essentially told her she would not have to worry about my dress because she\u2019s not welcome at my wedding. My mom tried to calm me down but they I just started on her and said she had failed me by allowing her to treat me like shit my whole life, I stormed out and went home. \n\nThe reaction from my family is mixed my sisters and partner has been very supportive and whilst they think I should not have shouted they agree with me that it\u2019s my wedding and I can choose who I invite. My mom and her six other siblings think I was completely out of order. They have said I\u2019m wedding is likely to be the last my Nan attends so I have no right to take that away from her. I feel like I could of handled the situation much more maturely however if someone else would have made the comment I definitely would have been but I just felt triggered and it reminded me of everything else she had said to me over the years.

Mal's wife passed away four years ago from an asthma attack. Two years after she passed Mal started dating again. Casually at first, but several months ago he met a woman he wants a more serious relationship with. He told his kids about her and after a few weeks of them knowing he sat them down and asked them to be honest about their feelings on him finding someone, and dating. His older two told him they were sad he wanted to be with someone else, and that they wished he was more like grandma (mine and my brother's grandma to be specific) and was happy with the idea of their mom being his one and only like grandma felt grandpa was her one and only. They did say they would be happy for him. But that was how they felt. The youngest said they felt weird about someone maybe marrying him because they didn't want anyone taking their mom's position in the family.\n\nMy brother was a lot of different things after that talk. Agitated, frustrated and even angry. He was talking to me about it and I could see how he was responding. I suggested that he should think of it as positive that the kids want to support and be happy for him even with their feelings and that he should be proud they could speak openly to him, because many kids might have lied because they didn't feel safe to be open.\n\nThis did not help. After a couple of more weeks he was still in that same state. I suggested he speak to a therapist and he snapped at me, told me he didn't need a therapist because he knew how he was feeling. I didn't argue with him.  Then after a few hours he called and said therapy wasn't needed and he was fine.\n\nThe next day he came to my house and asked me why I was so unbothered by it all. I asked him what he meant and he told me he would have expected me to say the kids need to see things from his perspective. I told him I could see both their points. That he was entitled and deserved to find happiness and love if he wanted that. That they had known grandma their whole lives and have heard how much she loved grandpa and never wanted another man after him, even after 50 years of him being gone, and it didn't shock me that they would want him to feel the same about their mom, because they loved both of them just as much as each other and in their ideal world nobody else could compare for him, just like it's probably that way for them with her. He became so angry and told me I shouldn't want to deny him happiness in his life. I told him to stop and consider that if he was reacting that negatively to what I was saying, how had he reacted to his kids, because all the things I said about the kids feeling comfortable being honest with him would go out the window if he expressed all that anger at them for being honest, when *he* *asked* for their honest feelings.

But then Jessy and I noticed something about Alli when the three of us hung out to catch up with each other, telling stories, and every single time Alli would just butt in and just talk about herself and tell the same story again and again, each time with different versions. She also likes self-pity and playing victim, and there was one time we invited Alli to go to the mall, and she said she was sick, but we saw her in the mall that day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd when we went out to eat, as usual, Alli said she had no money, and because I got a part-time job, I offered to pay for her food, so I asked, \"What do you want to eat?\" and she answered, \"I'm fine with whatever; I mean, you're going to pay for it; just choose anything.\" I said, \"Are you sure?\" \"What if you don't like it?\" She said that it was fine, so I ordered the food. When the food came to our table, she just looked sad and said she couldn't eat the food I chose and paid for because it wasn't the food she wanted. I was confused because I clearly asked her what she wanted upon ordering, and now she's acting like I didn't.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI always knew she was entitled, but something happened that got me to end my friendship with her. It was after exam week, and our parents arranged a weekend trip for us. We (Jessy and I) invited Alli, but she said she wouldn't come because she and her other friends would throw a party the same day of the trip. Saturday came, and Alli showed up unannounced with her bag and all. I asked why she was there, but she didn't answer; instead, she was checking out how great and pretty the resort was, then proceeded to ask where her room was. I told her that my mom booked a room with two beds that Jessy and I share, and everything our parents paid for is just for two people since she wouldn't come, but she could just get one. Alli got mad and said, \"I wasted my time here!\" I came here, and what? pay for my room?\" and she goes on about how her other friends won't do this to her, etc. That's when I realized that she expects us to pay for everything like we are her credit card. It hurts me that she only hung out with us for money, I confronted her, telling her to get lost and we don't need such a person in our lives. Security escorted her out because she was throwing things around, including displays in the lobby. Jessy and I are still best friends, and we never talked about Alli after that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI may be the a-hole cuz when my parents heard bout what happened They told me that I should've just confronted her in private instead of causing a scene and I should just forgive her for the sake of our \"friendship\".

I wanted to share the opportunity with other artists and have a friend, \"Monica\" who wanted to do a call for auditions for other instrumentalists and vocals for one of our numbers. We had a few people respond, one of them, \"Jack\" - someone I have had trouble with. Because there were only a few people interested, Monica wanted to create a group with everyone that responded to the call for auditions. \n\nJack had been awful to me growing up and lately done some pretty nasty things that personally hurt me. Things like loudly saying my name and sniggering with his friends talking about me and then pretending to not see me ( they are in their early 30s and are not 12),  saying things to put me down when in a group or just individually and overall has just been a very entitled selfish person. \n\nWhen I realized Jack was going to be in the group performing, I told Monica I was not okay with working with him and that given the history, I'd feel especially resentful that this was an opportunity I got that I was sharing with the rest of the folk. Even if I was not directly working on that number with him, I still didn't want him to get to work on something I was offered to perform for. I didn't want to share that with a toxic bully. Also, the community of the band feels like a happy place for me so I didn't want Jack to also \"ruin\" that for me. It was also interesting that when I put out the call for auditions, Jack didn't reply, but only replied to Monica's post and has made no attempts to apologize for anything in the past. \n\nMonica told me I was not being nice, and I should allow him to participate since he reached out to her and it would be unfair to exclude him if it was an open call to all, and that since I wouldn't be working on that number anyway, I wouldn't interact much with him. I insisted we politely remove Jack from the group and Monica finally agreed. I was not rude and politely said he could not perform for this particular event stating conflicting schedules but is welcome to join the band for any other event in the future ( I am non confrontational so I didn't want to tell him his toxicity is why I don't want him). I made sure to be nice and removed him from the group.\n\nJack reached out to me after that and asked if I could work around his schedule and accomodate him anyway because he was really interested. I honestly could, but because he has been so toxic in the past, I really don't want to. He insinuated I was being unreasonable and an asshole.\n\nNow, I feel guilty that I deprived a fellow artist of an opportunity to perform because these are hard to come by. And I feel like I should have worked harder on my feelings of resentments, because I'm wondering if I feel entitled to decide who can be in the group just because I was offered the gig in the first place.

We had general admission floor tickets. The event started at 10pm and we got there at about 10:45. The venue wasn\u2019t fully packed at the time we got there. After using the restroom and getting a drink from the bar we made our way onto the floor. The three of us linked hands so we didn\u2019t get lost in the crowd and we made our way through people into the middle of the dance floor. We were about halfway from the stage\/dj booth and the back of the club. After a few songs in this spot we wanted to make our way closer to the front. We started by going around this girl next to us who was dancing with a guy that seemed to be her boyfriend. The second we tried moving around them they were very resistant and were not letting us move. I started being more forceful trying to push my way through. The girl started arguing and told me I\u2019m mean for trying to get in front of people. I don\u2019t see it as mean because if they only want to stay in that one place then why care where anyone else around you moves to? \n\nLater in the night my friends and I were off to the side of the club near the bar when we decided we wanted to leave. We linked arms again to make our way to the complete opposite side of the club where the exit was. One of my friends was leading, I was in the middle, and my other friend behind me. Not far into moving our way through the crowd while we were still relatively close to the bar, I feel that my friend behind me was being pulled backwards. I pull her towards me again and I get resistance again. So I turn around and a man is grabbing onto her arm not letting her go. This man was not security and didn\u2019t work for the club, he was a guest just like we were. He wasn\u2019t letting her go because he didn\u2019t want her to be in front of him in the crowd. I had to yell at the guy to tell him we\u2019re trying to leave the club, not trying to get closer to the stage, before he finally let go. \n\nAm I the asshole for trying to get close to the DJ in the crowd and for making my way through the crowd like I did?","upvote_ratio":0.7,"created_utc":1678576986.0},{"title":"AITA for telling my aunt and uncle they had no right to start a family argument at my wedding?","author":"Single-Shake-8392","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/11nl8lf\/aita_for_telling_my_aunt_and_uncle_they_had_no\/","text":"I got married three weeks ago and my day ended up spoiled by my family when an argument erupted during the reception that led to four people being kicked out\/leaving and a whole bunch of family drama aired for everyone to hear.\n\nBG, for those who will ask what it was about: I have two uncle's and one aunt on my mom's side. My mom's oldest brother is Liam and he has been widowered for almost 25 years now. She was sick briefly and passed quickly and left him and their son, my cousin Ben behind. Ben is 32 and lost his mom when he was only 7. At some point a year or two after Liam's wife passed away, Ben had mentioned maybe dating again to his siblings and then a few weeks later had told them he changed his mind and when asked, he said Ben didn't want him to date and replace his mom and he didn't want to upset his son or force a new person on him if he wanted things to stay the same. He said it would be more trouble than it was worth (exact quote as told to me by mom a couple of years ago). My aunt and other uncle were furious that Ben would say that to Liam and that Liam would swear off dating for a child. But Liam insisted he was fine. Liam has never been on a single date or had any kind of romantic relationship with anyone since his wife died. There are times he seems lonely but he and Ben are very close and he spends time with his grandkids a lot also.\n\nApparently my aunt and other uncle never ever got over the fact Ben never gave his dad permission to date and the fact he knows Liam hasn't dated and still doesn't encourage it.\n\nThis all bubbled over at my wedding. I had no idea the anger was still so strong. But while Ben and his wife were dancing, and Liam was dancing with his grandkids, my aunt and other uncle went over to confront Ben and started yelling and calling him selfish. In the space of about twenty minutes everyone in attendance knew an 8\/9 year old Ben had asked his dad not to date and that Liam listened and had never dated since his wife died. Security had to step in. Ben, his wife, their kids and Liam all left and my aunt and uncle were kicked out.\n\nI was angry. The whole thing caused such a disruption and shifted the whole focus away from the party. I called my aunt a few days later and told her she needed to apologize and she said she couldn't believe I would ask for one and wasn't on their side. Then three days ago I saw her and my uncle and told them they had no right to start an argument at my wedding and should be ashamed of themselves. They said I should care enough about Liam to stand by them and be willing to let my wedding take the place of when it would happen.\n\nAITA?","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1678443373.0},{"title":"AITA for telling my mom she can\u2019t be in the delivery room?","author":"DistributionFirst604","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/11o8hhl\/aita_for_telling_my_mom_she_cant_be_in_the\/","text":"I (F20) am only 6 weeks pregnant with my first child. I\u2019m still planning and figuring out all of the things that go along with pregnancy and preparing for a baby. \n\nRecently, I started to begin planning my delivery (i know it\u2019s still really early but I\u2019m just an overly excited first time mom) and I knew that my labor\/delivery plan did not involve having my mom in the room. I\u2019ve always been very private when about my body and I\u2019ve never even liked for my mom to see me naked. My mom however is very open about stuff like that. To make things worse, my older sister (30) had my mom in the room when giving birth to her second and third children. When having her first child, my sister told my mom to wait in the waiting room while she pushed but my mom simply left because she felt disrespected. \n\nToday i told my mother (F51) that she\u2019s welcome to wait in the waiting room but i don\u2019t want her in the room while i push. She said she just wouldn\u2019t be there then. When i prompted her on WHY she wants to be in the room she simply said because her mom was in the room with her. I told her that\u2019s not a good reason and that she\u2019s not entitled to be in the room while i give birth just because she\u2019s MY mom. Again i prompted WHY she wants to be in the room and she said \u201cbecause i want to\u201d to which i replied, \u201cI\u2019m the person giving birth so i think what i want is more important\u201d\u2026.she had no response to that.  She ended up saying that if she couldn\u2019t be in the room then my best friend shouldn\u2019t be in the room either and that it\u2019s only fair that way. But my best friend (20F) and i have been friends for TEN YEARS and i AM comfortable enough for her to see me naked or talk about sex or other private things. It\u2019s a completely different relationship. I can understand how my mom might be upset about it, but isn\u2019t it up to me who gets to be in the room for this life altering moment in MY LIFE?? \n\nNow she\u2019s giving me the silent treatment which really sucks because I\u2019m staying at her house for a few weeks. Now I\u2019m not even comfortable in the place where I\u2019m staying. \n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: i realized i didn\u2019t mention that i do have a partner and am not a single mom. My boyfriend will be present for the birth. I don\u2019t want to give the wrong impression that I\u2019m doing this alone.

You are matched with roommates based on your answers to a questionnaire and then placed into an apartment unit. There were many pros, but the relevant ones are that the units are NOT co-ed, but they do allow for overnight stay of a tenant\u2019s guest for 1-2 nights (i.e. a weekend visit). I moved in the first week of August, about two weeks after my app was approved, and met my two roommates. I\u2019ll call them Jess (22F) and Tay (20F). They were both very nice and welcoming, and even offered to help me with my move in process. Later that day, I also met Jess\u2019s husband, Dave (23M). I was surprised she was married (they were apparently wed sometime in the year prior) but I didn\u2019t have any issue until I realized that Dave lives with Jess. \n\nI asked Tay and she confirmed it, saying it was like that the previous year when she moved in. I asked her if the apartment office or our landlord knew. Tay said going by the rules in the lease, she\u2019d assume no, and that she hasn\u2019t said anything because she\u2019s afraid of confrontation. I am too, but I am also incredibly uncomfortable living with a male stranger when I signed up for non-coed living. I asked Jess about it to confirm Dave indeed lives with her and that the landlord doesn\u2019t know, and she laughed and said yeah, she didn\u2019t plan on living out until she finished her degree so she just moved her husband in and doesn\u2019t tell the office. I asked her why not get a one or two bedroom that they can share, and she said she\u2019d already renewed her lease, so it would just be cheaper and more convenient to stay.\n\nThe last straw, though, was when I caught Dave looking at my chest and not even trying to hide it. I felt sick and objectified and it practically ruined my Valentine\u2019s Day. I went straight to the office and told them everything. When I got back to my apartment later that evening, Jess was on the couch crying and ranting. She screamed at me when she saw me and said she\u2019s getting evicted and it\u2019s my fault and that I\u2019m \u201ckicking a poor pregnant college student out on the street\u201d. I didn\u2019t even know she was pregnant! She screamed some more and accused me of trying to ruin her life because now she\u2019ll have to withdraw from college since her only place to go now is her parents\u2019 house, and they live in a city three hours away. They were ultimately given 30 days to move out, but I heard from one of the girls in the office that they turned the key in after about two weeks. I haven\u2019t seen or heard from Jess or Dave since.\n\nThis entire thing came up a couple days ago when I was hanging out with some family members who live in my college town and were asking about how I liked my apartment\/roommates\/etc. They seemed pretty split on the issue, and I\u2019ve not really wondered if I did anything wrong until now. They have me questioning if I was an asshole. Was I?\n\nEdit- something I couldn\u2019t throw in before posting because of the word count limit is that Tay told me she\u2019d caught Dave checking her out multiple times, and it made her more uncomfortable that she already was. I was also told by one of the girls in the office that had Jess not kept this up for almost two years, they would have just given her the option to kick out her husband. She had also apparently been hiding her dog from the landlord too. So she was being evicted for multiple lease agreement violations.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1678466391.0},{"title":"AITA for refusing my mom\u2019s help to clean my bathroom?","author":"Gumdroplets98","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AmItheAsshole\/comments\/11p19jo\/aita_for_refusing_my_moms_help_to_clean_my\/","text":"I (24F) still live in my parents\u2019 house. My mom (62) cleans this house everyday, and deep cleans once or twice a month. By clean, I mean I\u2019ve often been called an organizational freak, but she is on a whole other level. Our house is spotless, and arguably germless except for some personal clutter\/items scattered because, ya know, we actually live here. I\u2019m sure the average person would not mind eating off our floor. Mom does most of the cleaning because they\u2019re her standards, but of course we all have chores and personal spaces we\u2019re responsible for.\n\nToday is one of those deep clean days, with full house vacuuming and disinfectant everywhere and old toothbrushes for every nook and cranny. That also means clearing the whole surface, moving everything off tables or storing things away. The problem is that she moves my stuff to places they don\u2019t belong, \u201cfor storage\u201d, but when I need to use anything I have no idea where it\u2019s stored unless I basically ransack the place again.\n\nShe barged into my bathroom just as I was about to shower and told me to hurry up so she can continue here. I said no thank you, I can clean my own bathroom without help. It might not be today, because I\u2019m physically exhausted, but I make sure to do my part. In response, mom said my exhaustion is why she\u2019s helping me clean. I answered it\u2019s because of her tendency to move my things, and that I\u2019ll clean because I know where to put things back. She called me ungrateful and we had a short yelling match while she continued to vacuum.\n\nBy the time I shut the door and began clearing spaces, I\u2019d already lost several items and found others in shelves that weren\u2019t meant for them. The thing is, I\u2019m a makeup artist. I wash brushes all the time, which can stain the sink so yeah it looks gross until I wash it. But I take hygiene extremely seriously, I disinfect all my work surfaces first, I sanitize every single thing in my kit, and keep all the nearly sterile back stock separate from my personal stash. So when I find some of my things mixed in with my clients\u2019 things I need to either disinfect thoroughly or throw it out. This was the case again today so that\u2019s why I\u2019m angry.\n\nHere\u2019s where I might be the a**hole though\u2026 this is technically my parents\u2019 house. I live here rent free with somewhat private spaces, so I\u2019m basically a guest and need to respect all the house rules. My bathroom is no exception to the standards for the rest of the house. But I don\u2019t clean it right away, instead I clean my kit one day and leave the bathroom for another day and my mom found it during this in-between time. So I\u2019m kind of holding this room hostage? And I am definitely not grateful for my mom\u2019s help.\n\nSo AITA for not following the house\u2019s cleanliness rules?

Jackson has lied to me and Paola countless times about going to rehab and being clean when he was actually getting high.\n\nFive years ago, me and Paola made the difficult decision to distance ourselves from Jackson for the safety and well-being of our other sons (one of whom was still a minor at the time.) We made it a strict personal rule to never, ever give Jackson money, and told our other sons to do the same. Jackson has been attending addict anonymous meetings and claims he has been sober for the past two years, but me and Paola are still cautious around him. We have not given him a house key. We will celebrate his birthday by paying for dinner wherever he wants; We buy him nothing that he could possibly use or sell for drug money.\n\nBefore Jackson was sober, me and Paola changed our will so that Jackson would not receive any inheritance in case something happened to us. We didn\u2019t trust him. We believed he would go wild and end up overdosing. The plan was for our middle son to be the executor of our estate and divide the assets evenly between himself and his younger brother. We have not changed our will since. Jackson does not know about our will, only his brothers and Paola\u2019s mother, Susana knows.\n\nWe were visiting Susana the other day, and she asked us if we were going to include Jackson in our will again since he has been two years sober. We told Susana that we are not going to include Jackson in the will because we still don\u2019t trust him. Susana said she would not tell Jackson but that we should have more faith in our son because he claims he\u2019s been sober for two years, has a decent job, and seems to have gotten his life together. She also told us that in a serious financial situation, that money would be able to help Jackson and prevent him from becoming homeless, where he would be more likely to relaspe.
