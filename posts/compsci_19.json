        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/97s8dl/on_natural_selection_of_the_laws_of_nature/",
        "text": "Greetings,\n\nI seek advice or any other help available regarding creating a specific mathematical model. It’s origin is at the intersection of the following areas:\n\n* fundamental physics (a bit),\n* the theory of evolution (a lot),\n* metaphysics (a lot),\n* foundations of mathematics and computability (should be a lot).\n\nThe problem I’m trying to solve can be described as to _**create the simplest model possible in which the evolution of the laws of nature arises from the natural selection of structures**_. This approach implies indeterminism and postulates random and spontaneous nature of some events. It is also assumed that the universe had the beginning (the first moment of existence). This task is meant to provide the tychism doctrine by Charles Peirce with a mathematically accurate dynamic model. \n\nThe mathematical model is intended to describe the process of changing of a discrete structure (like graph, consisting of interconnected atomic parts). Moreover, it should be the process of development and complication of the structure (it should be capable of producing even complex “intelligent” agents after some presumably great time). And this discrete structure is a medium on which the natural selection works on (there can be selected individuals and environment, natural selection postulates hold).\n\nThe idea is attractive because it assumes that the beginning of the Universe was simple and self-justifying and can be described by the mathematical model that is obvious in the retrospective: just like Darwin's idea of evolution and natural selection: they are obvious, but until they were formulated it was really hard to assume them. This research program is a special case of the _Artificial life_ / _Open-ended evolution_ problem (OEE) that has extra constraints that come from metaphysics (I also hope they may help to solve OEE problem).\n\n**P.S.** (on computability)\n\nThe only connection to computability is that individuals in the model to build presumably should incorporate recursive algorithms that change the environment (that is presumably the other individuals). I tried to imagine lambda functions or primitive recursive functions as basic ontological atoms (to incorporate to graph-like space) but failed miserably.\n\n**UPD**\n\nThe whole article is a description of the research program aimed to create an atrificial universe in which we can answer any questions like \"why is the present is this way not another?\" (it's a better formulated ancient question \"Why is there something rather than nothing?\"). And this universe formulation should be enough simple and self-justifying to be a candidate for model of the our real universe.\n\nAnd there are two main intuitions-constraints for this universe: 1) the start from the simple enough state (the beggining of time), 2) the complexity capable of producing sentient beings (after enormous simulation time of cource) comes from natural selection. And natural selection postulates hold in the universe formulation.\n\nBoth these intuitions give hope that the model to build would be simple and obvious in retrospect like postulates of natural selection are simple and obvious in **retrospect**. So there is a hope that it's feasible task.\n\nThe \"only\" thing is left is to precisely define what are individuals and environment in the model (environment should be other individuals presumably - again from simplicity considerations) and how the process of their replication and death takes place. At the moment I'm not even sure if the individuals should be bult-in or to be emergent... (but I lean to the first option).\n\nAnd sadly I have not moved far to this goal. I'm still in the situation of \"I feel like the answer the this grand question can be obtained this particular way\".\n\n**...**\n\nThere is the article with complete description of the research problem: https://kiwi0fruit.github.io/ultimate-question\n\nGitHub repository of the article: https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/ultimate-question\n\n**...**\n\n* [*other comments on GitHub*](https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/ultimate-question/issues/2)\n",

My thesis project is building a computational brain map, so it is mostly (80%) programming. I get to take a good number of grad-level CS courses.\n\nI am interested in software development and data science, but I mostly want to strengthen my understanding of computing/become a better coder so that I have the flexibility to choose what path I choose to go down later on. \n\nI am most interested in skills that allow me to secure a job that's remote work (think /r/digitalnomad lol)\n\nI really want to start working on independent projects, but I don't feel that my skills are good enough, and I honestly don't really know what I'm doing when I try. I don't even know what's possible because I only know a bit more coding than an average EE student. \n\nFor some background, I did an undergraduate degree in math and a masters in Electrical engineering. Relevant undergrad CS courses I took were OOP (Java), Data structures &amp; algorithms (java+ python), and scientific computing in C++ (grad level). \n\nI loved C++, and low level is a lot of fun for me (I think this is because of my EE/math background). Because of this, I feel like low level/systems is what I'd be best at. However, I love problem solving in any language (c++ is borderline masochistic compared to python). \n\nMy question is: I have a couple graduate courses I can take next fall, and Im wondering what is going to help me achieve my goals and make me a better programmer. \n\nMy graduate course choices: Operating Systems, Computer Networks, Databases, Systems programming (undergrad level), OOP in C++, Data Visualization, Graphics\n\nMore Engineering/hardware type courses are: Parallel Programming Techniques, computer architecture for AI.\n\nI can do an ML/data mining class in R, but I'm not too keen on this language, lol. I also have an ML/robotics type class in C++/Python that sounds interesting.\n\nI know OS is hard, and I am not sure if I can do it without a ton of systems knowledge, but it would be really fucking cool to learn how a computer works at that level. \n\nI am also really interested in networks, but I'm not sure what learning to build my own server can do for me? However, learning how the internet works would be very very cool as well. \n\nWhat do you guys think? I really appreciate any opinions. Thank you so much.\n\n\n ",

It uses only a counter logic that adds up the number of 1's in a column with the carry and outputs the last digit as sum and the remainder as carry for the current column. For last column(from which iteration begins till 1st column), the carry is 0. For the 1st column it takes the whole output of the counter as the sum. Please suggest if this can be implemented much easily than FULL adder of HALF adder, and if it can be more efficient than using those. Also, if it can be implemented at all, that is, such a counter can be made or not as I am a newbie to electronics. Please note that you might need to download the paper as the document is currently being converted by Scribd at [academia.edu](https://academia.edu) whose link I have posted above, and it says the paper might be available to 'view' only soon, as I have recently uploaded it.",

I tried looking through python programming/java programming posts/subreddits, but some of them seem too simple (do not mean that in an arrogant way), and some of them just straight up undoable at my current level.\n\nWhat I've done so far:\n\n- Web apps using Django/Flask\n\n- a small/medium iOS app.\n\n- Image classification/sentiment analysis\n\n- Building a small database through SQLAlchemy/Flask as an interface\n\n- Other misc. local machine applets using python, like a time series data logger\n\n\nSo my question is, what could I start building right now (ideally a shippable product) that would help me implement some DS&amp;A and face design decisions, at a medium-advanced level?\n\nI know I should look to build something that could simplify an everyday task of mine, and I'm thinking on those ideas. But I just wanted other people's suggestions as well.\n\nThank you!",

Why the quote that cache invalidation is one of the two hard things in compsci (Phil Karlton)?\n\nEDIT: In response to a comment, my question is about server side caching data layer, not CPU L1/L2/L3 caching.",

I put some notes in parentheses. It is so crazy how nicely this works:\n\n&gt;The object that can be identified is not the true object.\n\n&gt;The ID that can be discussed is not the true object identifier.\n\n&gt;The origin (person who created) of the Application and Computer has no ID;\n\n&gt;The identifiable object is the Mother of all things.\n\n&gt;Thus, the true void enables one to observe the true object (The source code/class).\n\n&gt;The source code enables one to see the outward manifestations (bugs/why the app behaves the way it does).\n\n&gt;These two abilties come paired from the same perspective.\n\n&gt;But when the object is instantiated, It has a different ID.\n\n&gt;This same perspective/person is called “The Profound Mystery.”\n\n&gt;As profound the mystery as It can be, It is the Gate to the essence of all life.

Many universities don't even require an ethics class to be taken at any point to earn a degree in computer science.\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts and input.",

What I mean by \"filler\" experience are not technical/programming roles, but things like instructional roles teaching kids/teens programming concepts (albeit the teaching program no longer exists), or any other non-technical role that still involves CS in some way.\n\nThe side projects I'm talking about are mid-large projects, such as a built-from-scratch websites, apps, or raspberry pi projects. \n\nThis may sound silly, but now that I'm seriously creating a CV, I'm noticing how well-organized your spaces need to be, and I'm not sure if \"filler\" experience or a mid-large side project will be better at getting attention.\n\nThank you.\n",
