I don't include the third one as I simply don't think that was at the standard of the first two. The second record definitely pushed the band into original territory as it sounded like nothing I had really heard before. One of the things I loved about crystal castles was that their albums had catchy songs buried underneath mad electronic sounds. Even though the band fell apart and even with all the allegations that eventually came I still like to listen to those records. I never thought that the last album they did sounded quite as good as the earlier ones.",
