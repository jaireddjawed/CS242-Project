        "text": "So I’ve always been a massive pc gamer. Until recently the last console I owned was a ps2 ages ago that I sold off. I’ve always played pc games particularly multiplayer pvp games such as shooters like tf2, battlefield games, overwatch, mmos like wow. With lots of non competitive thrown in such as games like minecraft and the various Diablo series and it’s clones going way back to Diablo 1 in the 90s.\n\nHowever in the past couple of years I’ve lost interest in pc gaming. My father gave me his ps3 he didn’t want and I’ve accumulated quite a collection for it. I’ve since purchased a Wii u, PS4, x360 and another ps2. I just love that I can stick a disc in and play games that are fun and physical media seems really enjoyable to collect. second hand games are pretty cheap here in the uk particularly for the older systems. Friends of mine online have recently left me messages on steam to ask why I don’t play anything anymore and I don’t seem to have an answer for them. I just much prefer to be able to turn on a console and stick a game on and it works with no need to fiddle with graphical quality issues or deal with bad behaviour from other players.\n\nI’m almost in my mid 30s now and I wonder if it’s age related? I don’t have as much time as I used to due to children but that never stopped me previously using my pc. Has anyone else experienced this? Recently I’ve been heavily collecting for my ps2 collection and people look at me like I’m a bit mad when they know I’m doing that when I have a lovely pc sitting there that’s capable of playing modern games. My wife has recently been commenting that the pc is a waste and I’ve even considered selling it but don’t because of my steam Library.\n\nAm I really such an oddball? Also I’ve come to really appreciate graphics on older systems. I have a friend who loves retro games and we were sitting there admiring theme park world on the ps2 and how beautifully detailed it is for a ps2 game. A few years ago I would have dismissed it as being too old to enjoy.",

It gives you about 120 games BUT most of them are shitty mobile games.\nStill, I think it's good value.\nWhat are your thoughts on the Origin?",

        "text": "I know that you're ready for another \"EA Hate\" post. I'm here to tell you this is (largely) **not the case**. \n\nSomething has been bugging me recently and I'd like to discuss and get a response about it from all of you. Last week, my wife showed me [this post about the size of a game's audience](http://askagamedev.tumblr.com/post/149466049419/80-20-5) in relation to its vocal minority. TL;DR: This post talks about the portion of a game's audience that is most actively engaged in discussion/information/feedback, which happens to be roughly 5% overall.\n\nIt goes on to say that this estimation is valid for just about any game, so I tested it on Counter Strike Global Offensive. Of its 25 million owners, about 644,000 subscribe to the CSGO subreddit. 644,000 people may sound like a lot in its own right, especially if you considered that if every single one of those people posted daily, that'd be a *lot of fucking CSGO* posting. That amount of activity was probably possible during its peak sales/playtime. Meanwhile, that subreddit only accounts for **2.5%** of the 25 million game owners. You don't even have to look further to guess that the other parts of the internet CSGO players gather to discuss probably equal out to the other 2.5%.\n\n**Where I'm Going With This:**\n\n\"EA bad, geraldo good\". We get it. EA sucks. After today, we understand that EA is ready to revive fallen franchises just to shoot them in the head with a F2P mobile Clash of Clans clone.\n\nReddit *seems* to be this massive circle-jerk of EA hate (at least on r/games and r/gaming, and many of us are becoming disenfranchised from it. From here on out, it's going to be more and more difficult to actually talk about the issue standing between EA and us players on account of its status as a meme here. \n\nBut we're still only the 5% of people who *really* care about how badly EA is fucking things up. I can't speak to the effectiveness of the \"A Sense of Pride and Accomplishment^TM \" fiasco on their sales of Battlefront 2. Even though it didn't sell all that well, it still sold 7 million copies. \n\n**The Real Point I'm Trying To Make Here:**\n\nIf we're to make headway on solving the issue, we need to be more vocal about the issue to more than just Reddit, and maybe even the internet. We should be vocal in the reviews for the upcoming Command &amp; Conquer mobile game. We should be taking the discussion to real people who are out there buying those games. Because if (in most given situations) Reddit and other forum sites only account for 5% of discussion, we're missing the people that really matter to the bulk of sales.\n\nWhat the takeaway from the EA conference is that our \"efforts\" from last Christmas wasn't enough to send the entirety of EA a message. The memes weren't enough to save C&amp;C from becoming C *of* C. Battlefront 2 might appear to be our watershed moment, with the discussion of lootboxes coming up loudly, but we still need to be more vocal about our games being *playable*, *finished products* that aren't solely about making money and satisfying market trends (like Battle Royale in Battlefield V).\n\n**Edit**: I've gotten more response than I expected. A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one. Here's a good quote from one of the responses that kind of sums up what some have said to me so far:\n\n&gt;Gamers should stop telling other gamers how they should be enjoying their hobby\n\nI absolutely agree with this sentiment. What bothers me isn't how other people choose to spend their money. I know certainly that the \"whales\" that spend hundreds to thousands on loot-boxes are going to find something to spend it on, and that's their prerogative. My complaint is that some of the games EA has been putting out are beginning to treat *every* player as a potential whale. Battlefront 2 was the most recent example where they fully intended to lock progression behind loot-boxes, unfairly giving big spenders an advantage over those that aren't. Not every gamer has the money or time to support that kind of play-style.\n\nYes, I know that gamers don't have to buy EA or anyone else they don't like. But that isn't the point. I *want* to play some of their games, I *want* to like what they do. I really like The Sims. I wanted to buy the game, but I highly disagree with every piece of extra content being priced so high, especially when they all seem to mirror the exact same DLC that Sims *3* had. When Sims 4 and all DLCs combined (at normal price) are just under **$500**, I question whether the entertainment value of all of it is worth that much money. \n\nI know there is also mixed review about EA creating a mobile game out of Command &amp; Conquer. I don't know where many of you stand on mobile gaming but I once thought it generally disliked at worst and ignored at best. It doesn't bother me from a business stand-point. EA found a way to make money, that's totally okay, but I'm still allowed to disagree and be critical of the decision. I'm not about to tell anyone they can't play that game. But I will absolutely openly disagree with something like that.\n\nSome of us find a lot of personal meaning in games, some of us just want to have fun and don't care how they do it. I'm one of the ones that gaming is a personal thing, it's a part of me. Part of what I enjoy about gaming is discussion, critical thinking, review, etc. And I think EA is worthy of being criticized just as much as they are worthy of praise. Why shouldn't one be allowed to criticize something they're passionate about?\n\nAnd again, I have to mention that this isn't some circle-jerking EA hate. I genuinely want for them to succeed. But they are setting precedents for other triple-A publishers to follow by adding pay-to-win mechanics, and I think it's worthy of criticism. I challenge anyone to convince me that pay-to-win is a good thing for anyone but EA.",

Now comes the point of the question, what do you do? Do you play the 1996 game out of the box, just like the 2018 game, or do you look for HD retexture patches, remastered soundtrack patches, and other modifications that improve the game?\n\nPersonally I really like the idea of playing a game as it was meant to be played, vanilla. You get the experience the way the developer intended. However, in some cases, patches and mods (usually fanmade) improve a game drastically (look at the various graphic improvement mods for Morrowind and Fallout 3 for example), but you're no longer experiencing the game the way it was meant to be experienced. You're now playing a game which got tweaked by a random guy on the internet.\n\nSorry if this all sounds a bit vague, but what I'm trying to say is, how do you feel about playing games out of the box, vanilla, vs modded/patched?",

And that's a shame. I completely understand a company going for multiplayer online because it can make a whole lot of money. But I just wish it wasn't the case.\nTo me, nothing is better than a truly great single player game with a great story. God of War is the most recent showcase of this. No microtransactions, day one DLC, or online components. Just an amazing single player experience. Well made DLC is totally fine if it really adds to a single player game of course. Mass Effect OT really showed this off well. So I have nothing against that.\nI guess this is why I truly love the smaller indie games that put story up front and try to experiment a bit.\n\nI don't hate people for buying an online game of course. They have a lot of fun with it I'm sure. Most of them just don't appeal to me whatsoever. I had a ton of fun with Path of Exile awhile back and really, really got into it. The model was great. Free with some sensible microtransactions. Almost all of them were cosmetic and you definitely didn't NEED to buy any (the stash tabs definitely helped some though. I actually bought a few just to support the game)\n\nI'm just complaining here, I know. But I hope story driven single player games don't fade out more, since they often don't make a fraction of what a big MMO or online game can make. GTA V online has made over a billion dollars by itself. \n\nAt least things like God of War are coming close to 500 million so far, so it's definitely still hopeful. And at least there's lots of great smaller title single player story driven games. Detention, Edith Finch, Beginner's Guide, and so on. All extremely memorable to me.",

I'm aware of some criticisms the game has received but I haven't seen any one else talking about the biggest issue that personally kept me from enjoying the game. I can't stand the main character. I imagine that I'm risking getting downvoted to oblivion for this opinion because Aloy is Feminist Jesus.  That's not a joke or a metaphor she is literally an immaculately conncepted child sent by Gaia to save humanity from Hades, and I like that idea.  I find the concept intriguing and I'm not the kind of person who has qualms with feminism in the first place. My issue is that Aloy is a Mary Sue. A writing trope defined as an idolized seemingly flawless character. She has no discernable flaws in her character whatever. The only supposed flaw she has is that she gets angry,  BUT she only gets angry because she thinks someone's else's decision is wrong and she always  turns out to be right about it. Her only flaw is that she's always right. She's the most powerful fighter. She's incredibly intelligent. She's so good looking that a king asks her to become his queen. She has bafflingly amazing social prowess despite a lifetime spent in social isolation. I was able to sustain a suspension of disbelief for robot dinosaurs and not Aloy. I found her character that unbelievable.  Which is a shame, because I really wanted to like the character. When I first heard about the game I shrugged it off because the concept didn't seem interesting to me.  The entire reason I bought it at launch was because I found out Ashley Birch was voicing the main character and I'm the strange class of nerd that gets intrested in games because of the voice actors involved. By the way to be fair the voice acting for the character, was incredible. Still I can't believe I finished the game with a reverse opinion than I started, liking the concept and story, while hating the main character.  \n\nWhile I'm talking about the game though I also want to say one thing I loved about this game that everyone else seemed to hate. The reaction choices you were given that had no real effect on the story. Whether you were vindictive or forgiving the story continued the same. I thought that it was nice to use it as a chance to emote with Aloy as your avatar without  worrying about a binary paragon/renegade morality system. The fact that the narrative allowed the choice of her not forgiving someone who was truly an evil character (Helis) and not be arbitrarily judged as evil by the game isn't something many games do.",

It feels so good to win be it ducks to lose especially when you spend all that time trying to climb. I feel like shit when I don't win games and get incredibly mad when I get teammates that don't even seem to try. \n\nI felt like I got fairly good at the game (masters for 5 seasons) but now I fell to diamond and the grind to get back up to so tedious. It feels like a never ending flip of a coin that I'm always more likely to lose. 1 week of SR progress is erased by a bad string of games. The worst part is there is no one to play with anymore so doing it solo-q is even worse.\n\n I know that deep inside I'm better off forgetting the game and playing other games that will bring me so much more enjoyment and won't actually detract from it. But it feels impossible to let go. I actually did stop playing for about a month and a half (during this time I beat persona 5, caught up on a bunch of anime stuff, and beat a few other games to.) Needless to say I enjoyed myself. \n\n\nHowever over time I just got that feeling that I always get whenever I want to play overwatch. It sounds dumb but I get this excitement in my chest. This urge to want to play and get good and win. So I caved in and started playing again for the last few months. \n\nMy problem now is no matter how much I play and watch vods of other players I never feel like I'm good enough to be where I want to be. But I'm also not not good enough to enjoy to casually. Its driving me nuts again. I always tell myself I want to stop playing and I stop but later on I start thinking about the game again and I just can't help myself but to keep playing. Like I said it's that weird feeling in my chest that drives me nuts.\n\n\nTldr: I have an addiction problem with overwatch and being good at overwatch. And its effecting me mentally.",

        "title": "Shop-keeping in Moonlighter had lots of potential but ended up in the bargain bin.",
        "author": "Sekacnap",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/8pmz1p/shopkeeping_in_moonlighter_had_lots_of_potential/",
        "text": "I'm just about to finish up Moonlighter (currently on the last boss) and while I've had a lot of fun with the game, and it feels great to play, I can't help but feel a little disappointed with how it's core concepts were handled. There was a consistent lack of depth in all areas of the game that kept it from being truly great. The whole time I felt myself wishing for a hypothetical sequel in the same engine where the devs could iterate and expand on the mechanics. In this post, I'd like to identify some of the game's shortcomings, specifically with the shop-keeping and discuss some possible solutions or at least what I would have liked to see.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Disclaimer:** This post may seem extremely critical, but I really liked this game a lot, it just so happens that I tend to tear the things I love to shreds *because* I love them and want to see them improve. It really is a fun game worth playing and I'd urge anyone to give it a shot, despite it's flaws.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with Moonlighter, it's a top down, action/adventure where half of your time is spent crawling through randomized dungeons, fighting monsters and collecting loot while the other half is spent in your shop, pricing and selling that loot to NPC's. While the dungeons are randomized and you do lose most of your loot if you die, it is arguably *not* a rogue-lite and shares more in common with the Dark Cloud (Chronicle) games than Binding of Isaac or Spelunky in that it's not about being an arcadey, endless test of skill or luck but a self contained story with clear progression that just so happens to have random dungeons.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWith that description out of the way, let's get right into the shop mechanics.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn Moonlighter, when you wish to sell an item, you place it in an open table in your shop and give it a price. The main mechanic to selling items is that you don't inherently know how much an item is worth and so it becomes a guessing game, you watch your patrons reactions and adjust the price accordingly until you find the sweet spot and make a healthy profit, the game keeps track of the reactions each item got at what price so you always have a reference. Moonlighter tries to throw in some curve balls with \"ghost\" customers. When these ghost customers react to or buy an item, it is not logged in your notebook so you need to remember it yourself, unfortunately this is as deep as the system gets. There are other types of customers like thieves (who will steal your items), wealthy patrons (who are the only ones that will buy items you put in glass cases) and adventurers (I don't even know what they do, that's how little they matter) but honestly they can all be ignored, save for the thief which is easily apprehended. There is also a popularity system in which you can get away with selling items at a slightly higher price if they're popular, but this can also be ignored entirely as it doesn't make enough of a difference and you're never really hurting for cash. So as you can tell, when so many mechanics can just be flat out ignored, there's a problem.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nRight off the bat the first thing I'd say Moonlighter desperately needs a gold sink such as debt or rent. You have nothing to spend your gold on but upgrades. There's no tension, no difficult choices of whether to buy that sword or save your money to pay rent this month. Since there's nothing you're obligated to spend money on and no time constraints, it's simply a matter of being patient. A $500k sword isn't a big deal when you make $300-400k in a single dungeon dive and have no other financial obligations. This issue extends to items since other than a handful of crafting materials, every single item you pick up is nothing more than gold in a different form. You don't use items for anything, they don't heal you, they don't have special effects, you don't have to ask \"do I sell this or do I keep it and use it myself?\" The answer is ALWAYS sell because there are no other answers. I think one of the biggest problems is that as long as you price it correctly, everything you put on display will sell. I have not once had leftover items after a day of selling. Everyone wants to buy everything and they will. Without any risk of not selling something due to customer preference, in-game events or some such, selling things doesn't amount to much more than it does in any other game, just stretched over a few minutes in a mini-game as opposed to a quick \"sell all\" button in a menu.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOk so how could the shop-keeping be fixed? There needs to be more variety, a little more complexity and risk but I'm going to try and stick with systems that are already in the game.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n First off, I would have loved to see some items grant effects to the table they're put on or if they're placed next to another specific item, etc. This is something that Moonlighter already does with cursed items in the dungeon, they have effects like \"destroys the item below this one when you return to shop\" forcing you to think about how your inventory is organized. To be honest, I love the cursed items and arranging my inventory (though it's cumbersome) but think that it's used in the wrong half of the game. Reviews I saw had a problem with it because it slowed down the action too much. If that sort of system were ported to the shop and changed to include bonuses and negatives to price, popularity, chance of being sold/stolen, etc. it could be a great, organic puzzle that makes you think about item placement rather than throwing anything anywhere. This would also help increase item variety so that they're not all the same thing with a different price tag.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNext, there needed to be more types of customers that actually have an impact on the shop. As it is now the ghost and thief customers are the only ones you need to really care about and even then a ghost patron doesn't really matter after you've priced everything out correctly. There needs to be customers that will noticeably only buy certain goods or will try to haggle with you at the counter, maybe one that can't make up their mind and keeps others from purchasing items that they're interested in until you talk to them, the possibilities are endless. It's taken me this long to mention it, and a comparison is inevitable, but the other big item shop game, Reccettear did a great job with this (and most of the other complaints I've stated). While the customer types in Reccettear were also minimal, they had quirks, and since items actually had practical uses, you might choose not to sell something or to sell gear to an adventurer at a discount price because it helps you in the long run. The customers in Moonlighter all feel like the same exact person and there's no difference in selling to any of them.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs stated earlier, the popularity system can be completely ignored and could use a total overhaul. Tutorials tell you that selling too much of a popular item is bad or reduces popularity or something but in my play-through it has not once mattered, ever. Popularity needs to be more drastic to matter, if something is unpopular (don't think I ever saw an unpopular item) it needs to not sell AT ALL or at a highly reduced price, popular items should be able to be sold at a reasonably higher price, not just like, 10-20% more and there should be more mechanics to make something popular or keep it popular, manipulating supply and demand and all that. The item placement mechanics I had suggested earlier could help, with items increasing or decreasing the popularity of adjacent items.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThere are far more little things that I could pick on like how there's a whole year calendar but no weekly/monthly events that affect sales, how there's very few visual customization options and I haven't even touched the dungeon gameplay. But I've already gone on for too long so I'll end things here for now and continue discussion in the comments.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo, what did you think of Moonlighter? Do you like how it handled shop-keeping? Is there anything you would have liked to see done differently? What kind of fixes would you suggest?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEdit: formatting",

        "text": "A few weeks ago, I completed my latest run of the Mass Effect trilogy, but used a mod called [MEHEM - The Mass Effect 3 Happy Ending Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/masseffect3/mods/66/). This mod pretty much does what it says, and redoes the ending to the game in such a way that you more or less get a happy ending. One of the more notable things it does is remove the final sequence with the Catalyst, entirely, removing the red/green/blue choice from the game, and just destroying the reapers, instead.\n\nAfter having spent so much time preparing the galaxy for this final fight, uniting the races, building my team, etc, this felt like the ending my playthrough deserved. I'm certainly not the first to say that the original ending to ME3 made me feel like my choices didn't matter, but I feel that this comes from the fact that you're presented with a significant choice to affect that ending in the last few minutes of the game. To adequately create that feeling of choice mattering, I think that all or almost all of player's choice's that can affect the ending in any significant capacity should have had to have been made prior to the assault on the Cerberus base that starts the game's ending sequence. Since factoring in every little choice made through the series would have been infeasible, any thing after this point should have happened based on the player's primary decisions through the series (Krogan, Quarians/Geth, etc) and the EMS score.\n\nA game I feel handled this well (albeit with fewer choices) was the first Witcher game (please refrain from spoiling the second or third, as I'm currently on WItcher 2). There are three possible ending sequences for this game, based on two decisions you make while playing (there are more choices that affect other parts of the game). The first of these decisions is made roughly half-way through and eliminates one of the endings from your choice. The second choice occurs just before the start of the game's penultimate chapter and determines how the next several hours of the game will play out. By removing the player's ability to make choices in the last few hours of the game that will affect the ending, it creates a feeling that something you did actually made a difference.\n\n**TL;DR**: If a game offers high levels of player agency, then this agency should be stripped away in the ending moments of a game, in order for those choices made to play out on their own.\n\nEdit: A parenthesis.",

        "text": "I'm curious to know how people generally play these types of games: do you go with the choice that you personally would make, or do you go with the option that you think the playable character would pick?\n\nGranted, even with the latter, there's still a certain amount of your individual view that goes into the decision-making process based on how you perceive the character. But I've generally found that I enjoy the games more if I go with the choices that I think the character would make based on their personality, whether that personality is already written into the story (like Until Dawn) or something where the player has more freedom to shape the character (like Mass Effect).\n\nThe reason I think that playing as the character is more fun is because I feel like they become a much more fleshed out character that way. If I'm making decisions based primarily on my own gut reactions, that often turns into a more passive experience for me where I'm not necessarily getting as invested in who the character is and what they're all about since I'm merely reacting based on what feels right to me as determined by the parameters of my own beliefs and worldviews (rather than giving consideration to what the character's views might be). For example, the first time I played Mass Effect, I played a female Shepard where I passively made choices based on my own views without putting a whole lot of thought into her character. It was still a fun experience, but when I played the series again as a male Shepard, I got a lot more attached to his character because I took the time to define his personality, motivations, etc., and made choices based on that information instead.\n\nObviously there isn't as much freedom in games where you don't start with a character creator, but even in the interactive movie type games where the script is pretty much set, you can still choose to react based on your own feelings or your perception of the character's feelings. In Until Dawn, although not my favorite game, I appreciated that it gave a set of traits for each character that one's imagination could flesh out if so desired (even if those traits ultimately didn't do much to sway the course of the story). \n\nI know it's been argued that the narrative often suffers in non-linear games where different outcomes are possible, and to an extent, I very much agree with that - but I do believe that the amount of effort we put into defining the character also plays a factor in how much enjoyment we get out of it (of course, that's not at *all* to say that terrible writing is the fault of the player's lack of imagination).\n\nThere's obviously no right or wrong answer here, but what drives your own decision-making process in \"choices matter\" games? Do you prefer role playing as the character or going with your own gut reactions? How does it affect your enjoyment of the game, and do you think that it at all relies on the amount of thought you put into the characters (again, not trying to excuse bad storytelling here)?",

        "text": "When discussing the narrative potential (potential being the keyword here) for video game's a common point that's brought up is that video games are interactive. Interactivity gives games an edge when it comes to narrative since, unlike film or literature, a game can deliver a dynamic narrative based on the actions of the player to provide a unique experience. \n\nHowever in reality, this isn't the case. Most games story and its interactive elements (gameplay) might as well be two separate universes as far as the player is concerned. What the player does during gameplay only matters as much as triggering cutscene after cutscene. Ultimately what's gotten from this is a movie with jarring pacing thanks to elements that have no bearing on it. However, due to the nature of the medium, taking out said elements would be seen as a terrible thing as it defeats the purpose of the medium.\n\nThe games that actually attempt for interactivity to be meaningful...most fall into a similar case as well. Except instead of gameplay-&gt;cutscene repeat it becomes gameplay-&gt;irreleventchoice. At its best some of the choices will affect the outcome at the end and maybe a few other segments of the game with the outcomes being relatively the same with slight differences or just good,neutral, bad.\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/8p5lcd/why_super_metroid_is_easily_the_best_video_game/",
        "text": "Honestly, nostalgia bias is largely irrelevant here, even though this was *easily* ***THE*** most beloved game of my entire childhood; I am simply stating my personal thoughts about it, while also doing a fair bit of objective analysis about it as well.\n\nYeah, I said it; Super Metroid is *the* overall best videogame remake ever made, and yes, that's *also* including mostly all of the other \"iconic franchise\" sequels on Super Nintendo (Earthbound of EB Zero, Super Castlevania IV of Castlevania 1, Kirby Super Star of Kirby's Dream Land and Adventure, Super Mario World of Super Mario Bros 3, Super Contra of the original NES Contra, Link To The Past of Zelda 1, Mega Man X of MM Classic, etc) as well, along with the Metroid ZM/AM2R/SR and DK Country Returns sagas.\n\n(And yes, I also know that Metroid Prime is often considered a first-person remake of Super Metroid itself as well, but it follows SM so incredibly loosely that it doesn't really count in my opinion. Reboot, yes, but *not* a remake; enough said.)\n\nWith all due respect to all of the other SNES remake-sequels (is it okay if I call them requels?) that I just mentioned, pretty much all of them fell into largely the exact same traps as their predecessors and in many ways even *worsened* them at times; Super Castlevania IV somehow **STILL** managed to have cheap bottomless-pit deaths all *over* the place and had an eight-directional whipping mechanic that passed right throught walls *and* was just generally so ridiculously overpowered that it pretty much completely trivialized both attack items and boss battles alike, Mega Man X was just plain *WAY* too easy (outside of its final boss) to be considered a proper MM game (yes, *even in contrast to MM2*), Super Mario World took Bros 3's Raccoon Tail power-up and made it so *ridiculously* overpowered that you could literally fly right over entire (outdoor) levels without even *trying*, Kirby Super Star was mostly just a straight graphical improvement upon its predecessors and *very* little else, Earthbound's combat system was only *marginally* better than EB Zero's, Link To The Past still felt more like walking around a giant medieval amusement park than anything else, etc...\n\nBut then comes Super Metroid, which (~~as ridiculously overrated as I myself can personally admit that it *also* is~~) not only fixed almost literally *every* single non-nitpicking problem with its original NES predecessors that I can name, but also added *so* much new content and *so* much more complexity to its original source material that at least roughly half of the people who played it back in the day forgot that it even *was* a remake of the original NES Metroid in the first place.\n\nAs gratingly many times as I'm *very* well aware that this has already been said by *at least* half a *million* other gaming critics before, basically every single thing you could think of about this game (at least in terms of what it sets out to do) is flat-out perfect.\n\nThe way that the game tells its *incredibly* dark and atmospheric (particularly for the time) story with literally *no* actual spoken/written words of dialogue whatsoever (outside of its intro sequence) was *far* beyond revolutionary at its time, and quite frankly still stands rather strongly even today as a perfect example of \"show, don't tell\", and the nostalgic references it makes to the series' previous installments are simply sublime as well.\n\nFrom the jaw-droppingly brilliant moment when Samus revisits (*very* heavily overgrown) Brinstar to the very first opening line of the game's intro being a *dearly* loving tribute to the original Metroid's \"WE PRAY FOR A NEW PEACE IN SPACE, WHICH MAY SOON BE ATTACKED BY THE OTHER METROID\" ending message (not to mention the new and *massively* improved Ridley's Lair and Tourian in Lower Norfair and Crateria), just the sheer amount of nostalgia fanservice in this game *alone* is mind-blowing.\n\nThe amount of abilities/mobility Samus had in the game went from miniscule to absolutely *gargantuan*, the controls themselves were improved *at least* tenfold, full-fledged save rooms and map tiles were added, boss fights (not counting the sea serpent in Maridia) went from groan-inducingly forgettable to *astonishingly* memorable (as did the areas themselves, which the game's main Zebes portion also had *twice* as many of compared to its NES predecessors without even *mentioning* how much bigger the areas themselves were, to the point where several of them ended up having entirely separate \"upper\" and \"lower\" sections OF themselves), so many new types of doors, hazards, blocks and enemies were added that it wasn't even funny, the game even added *friendly* enemies that taught Samus her Shinespark and Wall Jump abilities, Missiles and Bombs upgraded into Super Missiles and Power Bombs, all *kinds* of wonderfully choreographed scripted sequences were added, the pacing and level design were both utterly perfected to a T, the plot was finally given an *actual* sense of urgency for once...\n\nBut even without mentioning how much this game *added* onto the first one's forumla game-wise, what *really* makes Super Metroid stand out so strongly when compared to pretty much all other game remakes (~~besides *maybe* Super Castlevania IV~~) is the quite plainly *stupefying* amount of *atmosphere* that it entailed when compared to its predecessors.\n\nDespite the game being *extremely* hand-holdy by designing itself to be essentially impossible to get lost in or even to *die* in (outside of *particularly* low-health runs) and once again making the actual combat a *complete* afterthought, the general \"dreadful\" theme that the game induces of being stranded alone in the remarkably strange and desolate world that Zebes has somehow even *further* devolved into between games (assuming that Zero Mission's re-writing of Metroid 1 canon is anything to go by) is still about as real and tangible as they come in side-scrolling games, even to this day. That, and the graphics also are absolutely *beautiful*, combining the very distinctly \"straight out of a comic book\" art style that Zero Mission and Fusion later became known for with an amount of environmental and character-designing detail that *very* few other games at the time could even *dream* of matching.\n\nEven the sound design is shockingly realistic and immersive for the time, and to call the soundtrack itself \"perfectly fitting\" is quite the understatement (in quite a few cases, calling it \"amazing\" is *also* ***QUITE*** the understatement; for example, Brinstar's music went from [this](https://youtu.be/WVTzg2kvNaQ) to both [this](https://youtu.be/-Sn9G-RHtII) *and* [*this*](https://youtu.be/Pim1s_DBR64), while Lower Norfair's went from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkq6q1gU4cI) to [***this.***](https://youtu.be/DUN6aJlTD0w))\n\nFrom the game opening with an epically dramatic spaceship escape sequence (*and one-on-one Ridley duel*, let's not forget that) to the game closing with a shockingly tear-jerking five-second reunion of Samus with her beloved pet Metroid that she had been spending literally *the entire game* searching for (followed by a somehow even *more* epically dramatic death of its hideously mechanized and mutated main villain by rainbow-laser, which is *then* followed up by an escape sequence the explosion of which is so outrageously huge that it literally turns the *entire* planet into a bloody supernova, just in case the game wasn't already going out with big enough of a *bang* for you), is there really even a *single* thing not perfect about this game as a Metroid 1 remake/reboot? I honestly don't think there is, and that's not even mentioning its immensely well-deservedly *massive* cult status as a ROM-hacking template either.\n\nHonestly, when prioritizing actual gameplay quality over quantity, this is a *much* better and generally more polished game overall than the Castlevania: Symphony Of The Night that it later gave birth to, no matter *how* many times you may or may not have been told otherwise in various Sony fanboy circlejerks.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I also loved Zero Mission as well, but personally felt that it dumbed down the difficulty of its source material *way* too much (yes, *even when compared to Super*) and honestly did not add *nearly* enough actual *size* and *length* to its source material overall when compared to Super before it; honestly, Super Metroid Zero Mission should have been an official thing a *long* time ago",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/8p09eo/why_modern_games_have_failed_to_deliver_on/",
        "text": "It's no shock that any new AAA game released garners praise, criticism and the aged discussion comparing modern games to older titles. You've inevitably read or heard one of the follow sentiments:\n\n&gt; * \"Retro games have better story, more imagination, depth and 'game-feel'.\"\n&gt; * \"Modern games have clearer story, pacing and are aided by better technology.\"\n&gt; * \"I've gotten bored of the repetitiveness of modern games.\"\n&gt; * \"Trying to play retro games is an exercise in extreme, obnoxious, patients.\"\n\nThis could have easily been titled \"Why '**so many people feel**' modern games have failed to deliver on decades of narrative progress\", however if we were to survey everyone I'm pretty sure a bias would be obvious. Instead we can only move forward if we agree that there are many people who agree with 1 or more of the above statements. We'll also be at a crossroads if we disagree that there is much that can still be learned from \"Retro\" games, and improvements that modern games can easily achieve. My position is not meant to say there is no place for \"Cinematic experience\" heavy games. It is instead to isolate a gap in the market that players are dying to have defined.\n\nThere is a difference between \"Character Narrative\" and \"World Narrative\". A difference which every single discussion, essay, video or podcast on games has failed to explore.\n\nCharacter narratives are closely related to the \"Cinematic Experience\" we see in modern games. Here we have a direct path from the start of the game, to the end. With carefully controlled camera work, voice acting, motion capture and sometimes limited dialogue options that slightly flavor the experience. The story exists because of the character(s). Traditionally we can say the characters follow arcs inspired by film to precision. The narrative of the game is \"carried\" by the characters.\n\nWorld narratives get their story from events that happen to geography or the world. The characters react to those events. It's more important \"**what**\" was *where* and *when*, rather than **who** was *where* and *when*. You can achieve hundreds of branching story outcomes, not because of binary dialogue options, but because choices change the actual world and geography. The narrative of the game is \"carried\" by what characters do because of world-changing events.\n\nWhat would happen if you remove Joel and Ellie from The Last of Us? Is there still an interesting game there to play and experience? Is there enough going on in the world that makes it compelling to explore without them? What if you removed Link and Zelda from (nearly) any Zelda game? See the difference? How about removing Terra from FFVI? When there is no world for the player to explore, whats left is a **Character Narrative**.\n\nLet's get away from a virtual argument for a moment. Consider taking a trip to Stonehenge and forgoing a tour guide or reading the wikipedia article on it. Pretend you've forgotten all you know about Stonehenge. Just go, stand there and ask the questions, \"How did this get here?\" \"Why is it here?\" \"Who put it here?\" My guess is, if you went on a little adventure to answer those questions you'd have a great time exploring and discovering things about an ancient culture. Are you going to learn about specific \"characters\" involved in its construction? Are you going to learn about the specific conversations they had with others to get the structure made? No, chances are you're simply going to enjoy discovering this **World Narrative**.\n\nThere is a value to Character Narratives. They are indeed concise and to the point. They are perfect for someone with a full-time job or family, who wants to eventually play several new games within a month rather than dedicating over 70 hours to one specific game world.\n\nThough \"Cinematic Experiences\" are \"closely\" related to Character Narratives, it's important to separate the two. Many retro games are cutscene heavy and have elaborate character development. Those qualities don't make the game a character narrative. Likewise, all \"Open World\" games are ***not*** World Narratives. Furthermore, a character narrative with \"elements\" of an open world sprinkled in do not balance to a world narrative (I'm looking at you, God of War). After playing years of open world games, I can only think of one which could be considered a world narrative, Breath of the Wild  --  and I haven't even played it.\n\nFinal Fantasy XV, Shadow of Mordor, Assassins Creed (series - possibly with the exception of the first one) and Far Cry (series - possibly with the exception of the first two), Skyrim, Fallout 4 (3 is a grey area) are all examples of Open World, Character Narratives. These are valuable games, but pretending they fill that gap a large chunk of the market wants is just provably wrong. World narrative games are doing incredibly well, and no one has noticed yet.\n\nModern examples of World narratives can be seen in Journey (though limited in scope), Dark Souls, Okami, Divinity Original Sin, Shadow of the Colossus and Fallout New Vegas. \"World Narrative\" is the actual \"Retro Aesthetic\". It's games where the world is more important than the characters. Where if you remove the characters, you can still explore and understand more about what is going on inside.\n\nHow many different Shovel Knight games have there been, because the world was just that much fun and interesting to play in? There is still a ton of character development in that game, but the developer themselves have easily proven that characters can be swapped out for others and you still got yourself a hit game. It wasn't simply just pixel graphics and an \"old\" genre.\n\nChrono Trigger, Seiken Densetsu 3, Final Fantasy (pre-FFX), Baldur's Gate, Elder Scrolls (Daggerfall and Morrowind), Legend of Zelda (2d titles), the Ultima series, Planescape: Torment (to name a very few) are all games that utilize world narrative as the driving force for story, in exceptional ways that needs to be revisited.\n\nWhat modern games have scratched your gaming itch and can be considered \"World Narrative\"? Does \"World Narrative\" describe your favorite retro games? Character narrative games are still valuable, and your fondness for them shouldn't be discouraged. Rather, understanding the fundamental difference between these two broad categories is incredibly important to the future of development.",

The fantastic mods of your subreddit have been kind enough to let me post here for my survey here, which I’m incredibly thankful for. The survey takes around 15 minutes to complete, and at the end there’s a £20 Amazon voucher prize draw which you can enter as an additional thank you for taking part. I hope that as many of you (from the truegaming\\-community) as possible take part in the survey, as I want the results to be as reliable and applicable as possible, and in order to do that I need a broad range of people to take part. So no matter whether you've been playing on PC, console, your phone, no matter the genre, or if you haven’t completed whatever game you're currently playing, then that’s completely fine, and I’m still more than happy to hear from you.\n\nOnce the survey is closed, I'd be more than happy to discuss the results in full here as well, if anyone's interested in that.\n\nYou can find the questionnaire here: [ https://york.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_b9rFL7UwCQvd8t7](https://york.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_b9rFL7UwCQvd8t7)\n\nAll the best, Frances Perrett, University of York\n\nP.S.

The guys at Sony could be like \"Ya know keeping those PS4 servers up isn't worth it anymore, so we're shutting the servers off and if you wan't to play Uncharted 4 again you're gonna have to buy a copy on Ebay.\" Bust again, I haven't for a second had these thoughts when it came to buying something on Steam. \n\nIs anyone in the same boat as I?

        "text": "A well known aspect of shooters is gauging the \"crunch\" of a particular gun- how satisfying it feels to use. I spend a lot of time playing Left 4 Dead 2, and over the years I've changed which weapon add-ons are installed numerous times. It helps keep the game feeling fresh, and replaces the mediocre textures and models of the stock ones. But I've noticed that doing this changes the way the weapon feels, not just how it looks. With one mod, the pistols are thin and make light popping noises, and feel quite weak. But with another, they are squarish, larger, and make satisfying cracks. There's no actual difference in gameplay, yet I found much greater success using the second mod. It seemed like I could take down a horde with just these pistols, not because they were statistically more powerful than the others, but because they felt more powerful. This extends to larger weapons as well, such changing the stock SCAR to a different model with sharper finishes, a darker scheme, and a more piercing firing sound.\n\nNoticing this effect got me thinking about how it may apply to shooters as a whole, and why it could appear that way at all. Could the sound and appearance of a gun really increase or decrease its effectiveness? Perhaps it's an incentive effect; the more satisfying results from firing it leads the user to want to use it more often. Or maybe a subconscious power trip; the weapon feels more powerful to fire, therefor the user unintentionally is more aggressive with it and gets greater carnage. Or is this all a load of bunk?",

Everything that he was in the past had been taken from him and replaced by the identity of a man who he trusted and saw as a hero. Even when he dies by the hands of Solid Snake in MG1, he’s not dying for his values or own morality; he’s dying for the values of his former leader and the man who erased his identity. I think a lot of people misconstrue Big Boss as some kind of hero and Zero as some kind of villain when the truth is they are both horrible people who abused their power and took advantage of others.",

I understand that when it comes to story complexity in games you have to grade on a curve, but come on.

That game really surprised me when I first played it, with all the variety of options and skills they gave you. The action moments were great fun; the creepy moments had you on the edge of your seat. That slow\\-mo effect you could activate was really cool. I also loved the selection of weapons. You had lots of fun arms, like that one that turned the foes into skeletons. You could blast off limbs and heads with your shotgun. I even liked the limited, \"realistic\" number of weapons you could carry with you.\n\nCombat is extremely fun, especially hand\\-to\\-hand. Besides being able to hit with your firearm, you could also punch, kick, jump and kick, slide kick. I particularly remember that part with those dudes that become invisible, hide in the air vents and only attack you with their fists or something. I put away my firearm, activated the slow\\-mo, and went full bare\\-knuckle on them.\n\nFirst FPS I saw that had a great camera. You could see the rest of your body when you looked down, instead of being just a floating pair of arms. Whatever action you made, like rappeling off a helicopter, using a ladder, jumping and kicking, all of them had great first person effects that went beyond being a simple floating camera.\n\nCan't remember more great stuff about the game, but I'm sure there was more. It's been a long time since I played it. So, what's your \"definitive\" FPS?",

        "text": "I started getting more time to play games roughly a year ago and decided to play some great classics and other highly rated games from all platforms.\n\nOne big problem I started noticing is the grind. For some reason, I can spot repetition almost everywhere.\n\nFor example, Diablo 2, one of the best blizzard games, best Hack&amp;Slash games, etc. I got very tired of it after reaching Act IV which is the last without the expansion. I abandoned it for a long ass time for some reason like I do with many games after playing too much. I returned eventually cause I really wanted to finish it but in the end I didn't really like the experience. It was more of a relief to finally finish, not satisfaction. (I played as druid btw)\n\nThis is why I can't stand other Hack&amp;Slash games and MMOs given how the core mechanics of the game never seem change or very slightly. Sure there's *some* variation like class skils and levels changing directions but that's about it. Levels are gonna stay almost exactly the same from the starting one.\n\nInterestingly, I played lots of Assassin's creed, all the way to Black flag, except III which didn't capture my interest. And surprisingly didn't get bored, in fact, I 100%'d the IV game and felt really proud. \n\nOther games games I played were NFS: Underground. I enjoyed the first one and didn't get bored at all, one the second one which most people say it's the best and maybe of the whole series. One big problem I found was how the races were very similar and by god don't even get me started on the URLs. The first one had lots and lots of shortcuts which made it much more interesting, the second one has 3-4 IIRC. The difficulty was also retarded, in medium it was too easy but on hard I feel like the bots are cheating.\n\nSuper Mario Bros 1 and 3 from emulators. I tried beating them without saves and eventually did it, but I'm not sure I genuinely enjoyed them or I did just because I had to. I did get a sense of pride and accomplishment after beating them but that's it.\n\nNow I'm playing Mass Effect 1 which is a must play for any RPG fan like me. \n\nMaybe because I have a lot of time to play I'm having a different mentality.\n\nHave you felt like me on any 9/10 or 10/10 games?\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/8oniwb/what_are_your_thoughts_on_the_recent_trend_of/",
        "text": "With God of War 2018 out, there has been some discussion as to whether or not we really *need* to humanize long-played protagonists. This is such a different prospective than I'm used to hearing, and while I'm by no means 100% disagreeing with the assertion that blank or shallow slates are fine, I have always enjoyed the recent trend of adding depth to protagonists. \n\n*Uncharted 4* did a wonderful job displaying Nathan Drake as a relatively normal guy who can't beat the bush, so to speak. But it also doesn't shy away from t his flaws, and later on delves more into the relationships he's put strains on in building his house of cards. Early on in the game, Nathan is shown as having issues settling down, and drowns out his wife as she talks at moderate length about a passion. Furthermore, he even feeds her white lies about being happy about where they are in life. While by no means a major character flaw, these smaller issues with his relationship build into a mountain as he continues to lie and lead her on. My favorite scene in the game is where Elena shows up and catches him red-handed. I as the player felt embarrassed, and awkward, as if I'd been caught cheating on my SO.\n\nThis scene is such a far cry from the entertaining but relatively shallow wise-cracking Indiana Jones clone that was Nate of Uncharted 1 - 3. I tremendously enjoyed that version of Nathan Drake, but by 3 I was growing a little weary. In that sense, Uncharted 4 was a breath of fresh air as it made Nathan relatable to the point where I was re-evaluating the white lies I've told my SO in our time together. And for that player-connection, I appreciate the nuanced issues Uncharted 4 presents, and how it presents Nathan as a flawed protagonist. \n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, BotW made a very strange decision in it's characters: it tried to have it both ways. On one hand, Link in the past is perhaps one of our most developed iterations of a Hero, with a hint of a tragic backstory, \"performance anxiety\", and fighting against a fate he's been forced into. His silence is explained as a sort of PTSD, where he feels the weight of the world on his shoulders and can't seem to bring himself to talk about it. Yet interestingly, in Zelda's diary there's a hint of an emotional conversation that took place between the two that lead to them bonding, but this is only hinted at and is essentially dropped thereafter. This leads us onto the flip side: in the present, Link is more or less whatever you want him to be. Chipper and silly, or dripping sarcasm, his coma and memory-loss allows a narrative excuse for Nintendo to keep their blank-slate protagonist, and have the player choose whatever dialogue options and control his actions however they please. Yet this also presents a narrative conflict, as Link doesn't really demonstrate much in the way of tangible growth in the present. This \"we want it both ways approach\" somewhat cheapens the impact of the flashbacks, which in themselves were underdeveloped. This approach doesn't leave the player with a very established message, as int eh end Link must still confront the Calamity in the present and be the Hero he was destined to be. Thus, it's uncertain if the player is supposed to take away the message of \"be who you want to be, let the past go\" or \"you can't run from your responsibilities forever\". Perhaps there's a medium here, feel free to discuss.\n\nFinally, I move to God of War 2018. I haven't completed the game yet, and haven't even played the prior titles. But it's interesting to see Kratos, who was a generic John Wick character filled with hate, struggle as an older man to let go of [toxic masculinity](https://www.polygon.com/interviews/2018/4/27/17287292/god-of-war-ps4-sony-toxic-masculinity) and learn how to be a father - troubles and all. For me, watching Kratos struggle to learn how to comfort his son and let go of his standards of perfection was inspiring, but not without negativity like slow-building rage at his indifference at the start to his son. It also seems to have sparked quite a bit of discussion online about what it means to be \"a man\", as well as a father, and the struggle of not letting your flaws affect your child too much. To that point, while God of War may not be the most perfect portrayal of the issues of the U.S.'s ill-defined masculinity, it is certainly a welcome step in the right direction. \n\nOn the flip side of all of this, while sparking discussion about important social issues - large or small - in well-crafted media is important, and while using well-established protagonists is a great vehicle to spark the new discussion with the familiar, I also understand escapism. I like story-heavy games, certainly. but sometimes you need something mindless and fun after a long day. These characters, while vehicles for action, can be grown attached to, and I can see it being a sludge or a turn-off for these popular icons used for something heavier that you may not even agree with. Political disagreements aside, even, we wouldn't necessarily want to turn Iron Man into a commentary on corruption in capitalism/socialism/what have you. Sometimes, the familiar should simply stay as is for the enjoyment and simple pleasures. Turning an icon into a symbol for something different can feel out of left-field, and sour the experience. \n\nWhat are your thoughts? Can a \"balance\" bet struck, a la what BotW attempted? Do the benefits of well-delivered commentary outweigh the negatives, or vice versa?",

        "text": "Killer7 was recently announced to be coming to Steam later this year, so I've been wanting to kind of start raising awareness for it.\n\nIf you have no idea what Killer7 is at all, I’m going to give you a short list of reasons why you should play it, and the kind of people this game is for.\n\nIf you enjoyed\n\nNo More Heroes or the other works of Suda51, play this game\n\n\nIf you enjoy the music of the underated Masafumi Takada, composer of many Suda games and the Danganronpa series, play this game\n\n\nIf you enjoy wild, over the top Japanese antics, play this game\nIf you want to play a game I can say with 100% confidence is unlike anything you’ve ever experienced before, play this game\n\nIf any of that sparks any bit of interest to you, stop reading this, and prepare to wait. It’s one of those games that’d be best if you didn’t know much about it. \n\nNow, for most of you who won’t just take my word for it, I’ll be going into a minor spoiler reasoning as to why you should give this game a shot. So, let’s get into it.\n\nKiller7 released in 2005 for thee Gamecube as part of the infamous Capcom 5, a series of 5 games Capcom were going to release exclusively for the Gamecube, that all eventually were ported to other consoles. It’s directed by the man himself, Suda51, along with the other man himself, Shinji Mikami.\n\nThe “basic” premise goes like this: You are an assassin, Harman Smith, who has the ability project other personalities into the real world to perform hits for the US government. The plot  can be a mess of politics and philosophies, similar to something you’d get in a Metal Gear game, except several more degrees absurd if you could believe that. That’s all I really want to say as far as plot goes, because I do want to keep this as spoiler free as I can, but I will say it goes far beyond what I just laid out for you.\n\nThe characters and world of Killer7 are unique, nonsensical at times, and really showcases Suda’s talents for direction. This game is up their with Persona 5 in terms of sheer style, the camera angles, the spectacular death animations for the enemies, the characters who all have their own quirks and general lunacy, all show Suda at the top of his game. Characters like Susie, a detached head giving you puzzle items on top of being generally creepy, Mask De Smith,  the luchador-mask wearing bullet head butter, and your floating bondage-gear wearing, often snarky advisor, Iwazaru are a good general view of what you can expect from this game. . \n\nEven more oddball than the games characters and world are, is the way the game plays The best way I can describe is a genre bending mix of survival horror, rail shooting, and puzzle solving, all topped off with a beautiful presentation. The game is on rails, but you do control your character. You press A to walk, use B to turn around, and can select various paths with the analog stick. This may all sound a little clunky, but you really do begin to feel comfortable with it pretty quickly. The game has a very survival horror-like design, usually a large building with many doors, some are locked, and you must find keys and solve puzzles to progress through them. In addition to keys, each projection themself has different actions to complete puzzles. \n\nThe combat is something akin to a rail shooter version of Resident Evil 4. You have to stop in order to go into your aiming mode, and instead of the Plagas, your enemies are the Heaven’s Smile, which also look very similar to the from Resident Evil 4. They come in many varities and have varying weak points for an easier kill. I think the way the game controls allows for a lot of liberty to make unique, dynamic camera angles. Of course, Silent Hill and Resident Evil are known for some legendary camera shots, constantly changing from room to room, allowing the director to create angles to obscure things and give a stronger sense of claustrophobia in some cases. In those games however, shifting camera angles can cause issues with maneuvering. Killer7 ignores this entirely by you only being able to walk in two directions, but also allowing you branching trees to walk to other rooms. I will say that the dynamic camera angles can cause some confusion when moving from room to room, but all it takes is a quick glance at the map to get a sense of where you are and where you’re trying to go. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nAnd that’s as much as I want to give away. If any part of what I said, clicked with you, please check this game out when it comes to Steam, or just play it on Dolphin, I won’t tell anyone. I’d like to believe that as an industry can look at a game like Killer7 for what it’s always been, a shining star, bursting with unique ideas amongst a crowd of games that are content to rip ideas from one another until they build the perfect game. Instead of criticizing it’s unconventional ways, we could put something like this on a pedestal. Killer7 is, in my humble opinion, by far the best game Suda has ever touched. The other games featuring his name always feature a few… issues, despite also being games you should definitely check out. I didn’t really enjoy the combat of No More Heroes, sure it was stylish as hell, but it was boring… and easy. Killer7 manages to not only be graced by Suda’s talents as a writer and director, but also some genuinely clever and well thoughtout game design. \n\nWhat do you guys think about Killer7? I'm really excited to see it coming to PC, as a whole new audience will have eyes on it. If you liked this post, consider checking out my YT channel, where I made a video this post is based off of (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVhMnwou9P8&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n\nThanks for reading!\n",

        "text": "It's a pretty straightforward question, so I won't elaborate too much. Like many people in my age range, my first JRPG was FF7, and I absolutely loved it back in the day. But, to be frank, the random battle encounters combined with the turned based battle systems just seem outdated and tedious compared to modern games.\n\nI've read countless debates about which Final Fantasy is \"the best\", and while there's never a consensus, very often I'll see FF6 at the top of a lot of peoples' lists. So this weekend I decided to take a dive and see if I can get into it. 2 hours into it, and... I'm feeling the slog. The time it takes the game to transition to the battles, waiting for your turn, waiting for the animations, waiting for their victory dance... it's all stuff that never bothered me, but I guess now it's just not vibing with my modern gaming mindset.\n\nSo I guess my question, besides whether classic JRPG's in general are worth playing, is: Is FF6 so good that it's worth getting through the tedium to get to the good stuff?

        "text": "I haven't seen this topic being brought up anywhere recently, eventhough the general stance changed a lot over the past few years.  \n[Strawpoll here](https://www.strawpoll.me/15829017) \n\nFirst off the 3 most used kinds of MCs:  \n\n**1.The prewritten character that barely interacts with the outside world, while having predefined reasons for how it acts.**   \nThese characters *may* still be able to move the story forward, but will do so in expected ways.  It's often used in action-heavy games that are still somehow focussed on some kind of story.  \n\nFeatures may be:  \n- no customization  \n- no voice acting and only minor (if any) dialogue in game  \n- acts based on predefined characteristics  \n\nProblems are a lack of likeability and no way to identify with the character.  \n\nTwo very different kinds of games using this as their Main Characters are the Zelda-Series (Link) and Persona 5 (MC). While those games only have few similarities, the method works for both of them.  \n\n  \n**2. The user created, but *empty* character.**  \nThese characters have little to no distinct background story. The story picks up at some point in it's life, where you as a player are able to adjust his looks, voice and whatever else.  \nSince the character has no innate personality and doesn't really contribute to the story besides slaying enemies, it relies heavily on Roleplaying-aspects.  \nIt's mostly used in Open-World games that value gameplay way more than Story/Characterization. In games with a lot of dialogue the discussion gets driven by the player, not the character itself, so the player kind of becomes his character.\n\nFeatures may be:  \n- full customization  \n- very minor voice acting, but might participate in dialogue   \n- acts purely on player-commands   \n  \nThis type suffers from a lack of personality, but makes up for it with freedom of choice.  \nPopular examples would be the MCs of Skyrim and Monster Hunter.  \n\n\n**3. The fleshed out story-driven character.**  \nWhile playing through the game the player will gain extensive knowledge about the character he's playing. It will act on it's own believes with no need for the player to interfere and develops it's personality over the span of the game.  \nThe story heavily relies on the MCs words and actions, not the player's.  \n\nFeatures may be:  \n- minor/no customization  \n- full voice acting and lot's of dialogue   \n- acts based on character and personality  \n\nThe major problem in games that feature this kind of protagonist is players not enjoying the game at all, if they happen to dislike the character.  \nAlso the replay-value of the game (generally) is quite low, but many games might feature changing endings depending on few but well placed player-decisions.  \nThis type is heavily used in JRPGs and, for example, The Witcher 3.\n\n**Conclusion**  \nObviously, the perfect kind of Character which combines all 3 of these options is basically impossible to create.  \nSo, with the existing possibilities, what's your favorite (kind of) MC and what's the main direction we're heading right now?  \nAlso, do you know of any existing games that managed to do a crossover, taking the strongest points out of multiple types?\n\n\n ",

        "text": "What I'm going to share is an outline for a game that I think has a lot of potential to be incredibly fun and unique. I haven't thought through all of the details of how this game could work, but I think that you guys will be able to envision what would be like once you understand the general concept. \n\n---\n---\n\n**--Story--**\n\n---\n\nThe story of this game would directly follow off of the ending of Wario Land: Shake It!, [where Captain Syrup steals the Bottomless Coin Sack from Wario](https://youtu.be/Np6OgH2NyJU?t=249). Captain Syrup travels to Diamond City and uses her newly gained infinite supply of wealth to transform it into a bustling metropolis called New Diamond City, with her acting as its beloved leader. Wario, still fuming over Syrup ripping him off, would soon take notice of Diamond City being transformed and vows to get revenge on Syrup by taking back the Bottomless Coin Sack and becoming the new Mayor of New Diamond City. Wario teams up with Waluigi, his new partner in crime, and Lawrio, a shady criminal lawyer. \n\nThe story would ultimately be about accumulating riches and increasing Wario's status. \n\n---\n\n**--Setting--**\n\n---\n\nNew Diamond City would be a large, bustling metropolis full of various businesses and attractions. Thanks to Captain Syrup and the Bottomless Coin Sack, it would be a city full of wealth, a perfect place for Wario to make some easy coin as a master thief. Most of NDC would be a seamless open world primarily consisting of a modern cityscape - while quite large, it would still be a lot smaller and more compact than most other open worlds. The city would consist of a number of visually distinctive sections that make it easy to navigate. \n\nThere also would be numerous indoor locations like Banks, Museums, and Skyscrapers in which Wario &amp; Waluigi could engage in heists to grab valuable items to sell on the Black Market. On the outskirts of the city would be Wario's hideout where he stores his accumulated wealth. Captain Syrup would also have her own large pirate hideout on a private island on large lake adjacent to the city. \n\n---\n\n**--Gameplay--**\n\n---\n\nThere would be two main types of gameplay activities in this game:\n\n1. Pulling off heists by having Wario &amp; Waluigi combine their skills  to steal valuable items .\n2. Zipping around the Metropolis on vehicles to discover new heist locations and engage in frantic police chases.\n\nThe heist levels would incorporate puzzle platforming akin to many levels in the Wario Land games. But Waluigi would now be a core part of the gameplay. Wario &amp; Waluigi would need to use effective teamwork to pull off the various heists. Waluigi would be very nimble and agile and be able to reach most locations quite easily, but he would be very physically weak and Wario would be needed to deal with most enemies for smashing stuff. The duo would have various team up abilities, such as Wario hurling Waluigi through the air to reach a far off location.  \n\nThe vehicle gameplay would involve using a few different distinct types of vehicles to zip around the city streets and wreak havoc. Wario would have his classic [Wario Car](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/mario/images/a/a1/MKDD_Wario_Car_2.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110306012511) - which would be fast and powerful - and his Wario Bike from the Wario Ware titles - which would have better mobility but less power. There could also be a couple of vehicles for Waluigi to drive. All of the vehicles could be upgraded with various weaponry, gadgets, and mobility enhancers. For example, the Wario Bike could get an antigravity upgrade that would allow it to drive up the sides of buildings to make a quick escape. Wario would drive his vehicles while Waluigi keeps pursuing cops at bay, such as by throwing Bob-Ombs at them. \n\nIn general, the gameplay in this game - both in heists and out in the open world - would be very cartoony and zany. Players could just mess around with vehicles, wreaking havoc in the metropolis, and have a good time. \n\n---\n\n**--Wario's Friends--**\n\n---\n\nWario's various quirky friends from the Wario Ware games would also play an important role in the game. Characters like Jimmy T., Dr. Crygor, and Dribblez and Spitz would own businesses in Diamond City, and Wario would be able to invest money in these businesses for various benefits. Dr. Crygor would own a laboratory be able to develop various upgrades for the vehicles, and Dribble &amp; Spitz would own a Taxi service and would provide a fast travel service. Other characters like Mona and Orbulon could provide assistance to Wario &amp; Waluigi when out in the city. As Wario invests in businesses around the city, Wario would improve his status in Diamond City and get closer to becoming mayor. \n\n---\n---\n\nI hope that I've managed to paint a clear picture of the type of experience that I have in mind. \n",
