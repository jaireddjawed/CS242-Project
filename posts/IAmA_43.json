Native of The Bronx, my Undergraduate degree is from Fordham School of Business and my MBA from Columbia Business School. I started as a sell side analyst at Loeb Rhoades in 1962.

Hell, I bought a Cadillac in the middle of the oil embargo.” – Mario Gabelli, Forbes\n\nI am joined by Daniel Miller, Managing Director at GAMCO and lead portfolio manager of the Pet Parents’ Fund, a first of its kind actively managed ETMF venturing into the ever-growing pet ecosystem.\n\nProof: [https://www.facebook.com/InvestGabelli/photos/a.880250768746174.1073741828.878236828947568/1499560106815234/?type=3&amp;theater&amp;notif\\_t=page\\_post\\_reaction&amp;notif\\_id=1531251451095267](https://www.facebook.com/InvestGabelli/photos/a.880250768746174.1073741828.878236828947568/1499560106815234/?type=3&amp;theater&amp;notif_t=page_post_reaction&amp;notif_id=1531251451095267)\n\nInstagram - @investgabelli\n\nTwitter - @mariogabelli @investgabelli\n\nYoutube - GabelliTV\n\nUPDATE (7/13): Dan and I thank you, we have consumed our box of peanut brittle.

        "text": "Hi, my name is [Ken Bensinger](https://twitter.com/kenbensinger), and I'm a reporter at BuzzFeed News. I have spent the past three years reporting and writing the tale of the U.S. Justice Department's secret investigation of global soccer corruption. The case, which burst into public view in May 2015 with the arrest of top FIFA officials in a luxury hotel in Zurich, is the most ambitious and far-reaching international corruption and money-laundering probe's in American history, and has utterly changed the landscape of the world's most popular sport. To date more than 45 people and companies have been charged and two-dozen have been convicted.\n\n[Red Card: How the U.S. Blew the Whistle on the World's Biggest Sport's Scandal](https://www.amazon.com/Red-Card-Whistle-Biggest-Scandal/dp/150113390X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1523569477&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=red+card+bensinger), is the product of all that work. It was published in the U.S. just as the current World Cup began and is also available in the [UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Red-Card-FIFA-Powerful-Sports/dp/1781256713/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1531500073&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=red+card+bensinger) (where they call it football), as well as in [Spanish](https://www.planetadelibros.com.mx/libro-tarjeta-roja/210021), [Portuguese](https://www.presenca.pt/livro/cartao-vermelho/?search_word=bensinger), and  [Dutch](https://press.manteau.be/fifa-van-fairplay-tot-vuil-spel), and soon will be in Italian and Japanese as well.\n\nIn the book, I describe how Russia's shadowy efforts to win the hosting rights to the World Cup led Christopher Steele to alert the FBI, setting off the American investigation, and building a relationship between the former British spy and US law enforcement that culminated with him handing over the so-called Trump Dossier. But Red Card also explains how FIFA got so corrupted in the first place, and how a team of IRS and FBI agents, working with federal prosectors, brought it all down. You might also be interested in a [profile of Chuck Blazer I wrote](https://www.buzzfeed.com/kenbensinger/the-rise-and-fall-of-chuck-blazer-the-man-who-built-and-bilk?utm_term=.yb9Oz7KPZ#.fu5ypbK8P) just before the last World Cup; it started off my entire project. I also [wrote a recent NYT Op-Ed](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/07/opinion/sunday/world-cup-fifa-corruption-russia.html) on the parallels between the FIFA case and Robert Mueller's special counsel.\n\nI'm very excited to be here today to talk World Cup, Russia, FIFA, Putin, Trump, or whatever else reddit has on its mind!\n\nProof: [https://twitter.com/kenbensinger/status/1016502192067395584](https://twitter.com/kenbensinger/status/1016502192067395584)\n\nEDIT: Okay, going to shut this down.

Outsiders scoff and think my job is easy, but it comes with many many challenges.\n\nAn odd fact about me is although I teach sport skills, I personally don't enjoy watching sports on TV, except Philly eagles and NBA. I like to be the one playing, not watching other people! I prefer the sport science segments on ESPN, than the recaps and stories. I am interested in the science of fitness and movement. I still love competition, but professional athletes and some collegiate athletes, and league exec's have demonstrated such poor sportsmanship and business decisions that it's nearly unwatchable. I prefer to compete or root.for my  own children and students I teach.\n\nI got into sports and fitness very late in my life so my peers were more skilled than I, even though I had the drive and heart. So my philosophy has been to encourage the students that sit on the bench and sidelines, to find a love for fitness and sport. Not to become a pro athlete, but to live a long life with minimal illness and injury.\n\nAMA!\n\n",

Only 10&amp;#37; of people with TS have coprolalia, I am one of those 10&amp;#37;\n\nQ. Is tourettes involuntary?\n\nA. Kind of, its disvoluntary, meaning I don't choose to tic, however I SOMETIMES can stop it. Controlling tics causes TS patients either pain or discomfort, and eventually does need a release, there's a build up of pressure similar to holding in gas. Some people with TS can control it all day, some people with TS get breaks from their employer to tic for 5 minutes away from customers, and come back to work, I can only safely control it for less than 10 minutes.\n\nQ. Can you joke about it?\n\nA. Sometimes. Sometimes my tics surprise me, and make me laugh. Sometimes the reactions are pretty golden. Personally I don't remember ever laughing when I was away from people who knew me, because the reactions of strangers towards me is a lot different when they see people next to me acting totally normal. When I'm with friends strangers act less afraid of me, and they don't make fun of me. I get made fun of by teens a lot when I'm alone, and sometimes even adults!\n\nProof: I'm a moderator of [r/Tourettes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tourettes) [https://www.reddit.com/user/Ieatbabies154](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ieatbabies154)\n\nEDIT: I've been answering questions for hours, I have a request for anyone artistic that reads this.

America, your tax stuff is SUPER weird and I have no idea what a Roth IRA is.\n* If you want to ask me a “should I do X or Y with my money” type question, I’ll need context (like: what other debts/assets do you have, how old(ish) are you, what are your goals etc). \n\n\\------------------------------\n\nUPDATE (13:42pm): Thanks for the questions, gang! I'm going to take a break, but you're welcome to leave more questions if you'd like. I'll log on again tomorrow and answer a couple more.

The shining jewel of this state-of-the-art line is a breathtaking visitors’ pavilion beneath the river.  Major dignitaries, including New York City’s Mayor and the President of the United States, are in attendance for the inaugural run, as the first train slowly pulls in.\n\nUnder the station’s bright ceiling lights, the shiny silver cars gleam. But as the train comes closer into view, a far different scene becomes visible.\n\nAll the train’s cars are empty.\n\nAll the cars’ interiors are drenched in blood.\n\nAs chaos descends, all those in the pavilion scramble to get out. But the horror is only beginning. High levels of deadly methane fill the tunnels. The structure begins to flood. For those who don’t drown, choke or spark an explosion, another terrifying danger awaits—the thing that killed all those people on the train. It’s out there…and it’s coming.\n\nThere's something living beneath New York City, and it's not happy we've woken it up.\n \nFor more information on AWAKENED:https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062687883/awakened/\n\n\nProof: https://i.redd.it/tnwghbbeme911.jpg",

Your questions have been great and we're really glad we could share our excitement and enthusiasm for this discovery with you.  We do hope to come back later and answer some of those we couldn't get to during the AMA. IceCube has a lot more information on their website if you still have a question you need answered: [https://icecube.wisc.edu/news/view/586](https://icecube.wisc.edu/news/view/586) and you can find more here, too: [https://news.wisc.edu/cosmic-rays/](https://news.wisc.edu/cosmic-rays/).\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nHi Reddit!\n\nWe’re posting this AMA early so people can follow along with our live press conference –[https://www.youtube.com/c/VideosatNSF/live](https://www.youtube.com/c/VideosatNSF/live) – and begin asking questions. We will start answering questions around 12:30 p.m. ET.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nWe’re Justin Vandenbroucke and Ali Kheirandish, two scientists at the [Wisconsin IceCube Particle Astrophysics Center](https://wipac.wisc.edu/) (WIPAC) and members of the [IceCube](https://icecube.wisc.edu/) Collaboration, an international project using a cubic kilometer of South Pole ice to detect and study neutrinos, some of the universe’s most mysterious particles.\n\nOur team at IceCube, along with our partners at about 20 observatories on Earth and in space – including the [Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope](https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/) and the [Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov Telescope](https://magic.mpp.mpg.de/), or MAGIC – just announced today news of some of the first good evidence for a source of astrophysical neutrinos, and therefore, of cosmic rays. We are excited about these new results!\n\n[Cosmic rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray) were discovered more than a century ago and have been a mystery ever since. Earth is constantly being pelted by these extremely energetic particles, and we don’t know where most of them come from. But, we use neutrinos to help track them and now, we know more!\n\nIn September 2017, IceCube detected an extremely energetic neutrino coming from the direction of the Orion constellation. Automated systems immediately sent an alert to other telescopes around the world, and Fermi and MAGIC saw gamma rays coming from the same place.\n\nThat place was a blazar, a galaxy with a supermassive black hole that absorbs new material and shoots out galaxy-sized jets of energy and matter. These jets point toward Earth and the coincident observations of high-energy neutrinos and gamma rays indicate that these objects are almost certainly accelerating cosmic rays to high energies.\n\nCosmic rays are hard to pin down because they’re charged particles, which means their paths through the universe get distorted by magnetic fields. But objects that produce high-energy cosmic rays must also produce neutrinos, which have no charge and rarely interact with matter. This means they can travel in straight lines for billions of years.\n\nAt IceCube, we use a billion tons of ice to try to catch neutrinos. All this mass makes it more likely a neutrino is snared; otherwise it will continue on its straight path, undetected. On average, we catch only one neutrino for every million that cross IceCube, but when they do collide with a molecule of ice, this creates charged particles that travel faster than the speed of light in ice. This gives off [Cherenkov radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherenkov_radiation) (the same effect that gives nuclear reactors their eerie blue glow) and thousands of light detectors one mile beneath the South Pole watch for this light.\n\nWe’d love to answer your questions about this discovery and about cosmic rays, IceCube, working at the South Pole, or what it’s like to collaborate with scientists all over the world. Thousands of our colleagues around the world are celebrating today, and we’d like to celebrate a bit with you, too.\n\n/u/IceCubeObservatory includes:\n\n**Justin Vandenbroucke (JV)** \\- University of Wisconsin–Madison professor of physics and astronomy. In addition to his work on neutrinos and gamma rays with IceCube and the [Cherenkov Telescope Array](https://www.cta-observatory.org/), Justin runs the Distributed Electronic Cosmic-Ray Observatory, [DECO](https://wipac.wisc.edu/deco/data), a citizen science project lets people around the world detect cosmic rays with their cell phones and tablets.\n\n**Ali Kheirandish (AK)** \\- a postdoc in physics at UW–Madison. His research focuses on particle astrophysics with high-energy neutrinos – identifying the sources of cosmic neutrinos and searching for physics beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics.\n\nProof! [https://imgur.com/a/XB10cQY](https://imgur.com/a/XB10cQY)\n\nWe are  joined by **Nahee Park (NP)**, a researcher focused on very high energy gamma-ray measurements as part of the VERITAS collaboration. She is currently a Bahcall Fellow at WIPAC, using IceCube data to study hadronic accelerators in the universe and working to develop future neutrino detectors.\n\nProof: [https://imgur.com/a/d98JPtc](https://imgur.com/a/d98JPtc)\n\nWe are also joined by colleagues from the Fermi telescope, here as /u/NASA, including:\n\n**Elizabeth Ferrara (EF)** \\- deputy lead scientist, Fermi Science Support Center at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center\n\n**Tonia Venters (TV)** \\- multimessenger theorist, Astroparticle Physics Laboratory at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center\n\n**Joseph Eggen (JE)** \\- astrophysicist, Fermi Science Support Center at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center\n\nProof!

        "text": "Edit: I am out of time for the AMA, but I will answer any questions that are posted later when I can.\n\nHello Reddit, A few years ago I had a contract with a publisher for my novel and other's in the series that I was working on, but as the time drew closer for me to finish the next book in the series and for my first novel to be released, I became harder for me to finish as my anxiety grew. I am not used to being the center of attention, and even though I absolutely enjoy coming up with stories and sharing them with my friends, coworkers, and classmates, the idea of having people I do not know reading them absolutely terrifies me. I also began having a lot of self doubts over the novel. I ended up losing my publisher a couple months before the scheduled release date.\n\nHowever, after a few months I saved up to hire on an editor, cover artist, and layout designer to begin the process to self-publish. However, near the end of the editing process my doubts and anxiety hit again, and I kept putting off going through the changes the editor made, and the only reason I made it to the next stage was because my friends kept pushing me to. If it wasn't for them I would have still kept pushing back my own personal release date, almost still did.\n\nThe main reason I wanted to do this AMA is to help myself get used to the idea of having myself in a position I am not comfortable with and I have been fighting tooth and nail with myself to make this post. So Reddit please ask me anything and I will do my best to answer.\n\nEdit:  I am a dingus and should have used both my old contract and cancellation letter as proof sooner, I know the mods have already verified me, but I just wanted to add it for piece of mind, I have edited out any sensitive information, they can be seen here [https://ibb.co/namjWo](https://ibb.co/namjWo) and here [https://ibb.co/hAQ6cT](https://ibb.co/hAQ6cT) . If the mods feel this is still too sensitive I will remove them.\n\nEdit: I won't be posting a link of my novel here as I want this AMA more for me to handle my anxiety, but if anyone would like it I am more than happy to pm it.\n\nAnyways have at Reddit.",

        "text": "**EDIT SIX: 7/12, 11:00AM: I woke up this morning and had about a hundred new questions in my inbox, I'm sitting at the airport and don't have anything to do, so feel free to keep asking questions, I'll be around.**\n\nLast year, I quit my old job as a stage manager and performer and moved across the country to become the Entertainment Manager of the [Georgia Renaissance Festival](https://www.garenfest.com). I do everything from booking the entertainment acts to directing our local shows to building costumes and, occasionally,[ playing a fairy](https://i.imgur.com/sk05xhM.jpg) and sometimes [a twi'lek](https://imgur.com/a/m1JDk35).\n\nI've seen some things that I can never unsee and firmly believe I have one of the coolest jobs in the universe.\n\nIt's...a very weird job. Lots of people ask me what it is, exactly, that I do, and since I'm tired of sorting fabric in my office, here we are.  AMA!\n\nHere is a FAQ:\n\n1. \\*I'm new to the Renaissance Faire, what should I expect?\\* - Expect anything and everything. There is tons to see and do, from stage shows to music to street performers to \"living history\" characters, to shopping and old-timey carnival rides to about as much food as you can possibly care to enjoy. Drink water. Wear Sunscreen.  Wear practical shoes. Don't let anyone judge you for wanting to dress up in a fun costume. Live your best life.\n2. \\*Is the Ren Fest just a wretched hive of scum and villany and the occaisional orgy?\\* - Not really. While people tend to be more open minded, it's not a crazy sex party. I promise.\n3. \\*But Mah Historical Accuracy!\\* - Sorry bro. Check out the SCA, or any number of other wonderful historical reenactments that happen all over. The Renaissance Faire is a beautiful wonderful mishmash of all sort of crazy time periods, events, people, places and things, so there might be a little stormtrooper in your soup, but it's okay.\n4. Yes, you can contact me with info about your renaissance band or act. PM me and I will give you my contact info.\n\nProof:  [Look it's me and a magical dragon!](https://twitter.com/CatieOsaurus/status/1017123089019174913)",

        "text": "Conservation initiatives helped communities affected by Hurricane Maria. They also promoted change in Puerto Rico’s energy policy. I’m joining with NOVA, the PBS science documentary series, to illustrate how. \n\nHi! My name is [Arturo A. Massol-Deyá](https://twitter.com/casapuebloorg/status/1016758756011659264), and I’m from a mountainous area of Puerto Rico in the Adjuntas municipality, where my parents founded the community-based organization Casa Pueblo. I grew up heavily involved in this project and have chaired its Board of Directors since 2007. \n\nCasa Pueblo is driven to protect Puerto Rico’s natural resources. It was responsible for protecting the Island’s central region and its critical watersheds from an open pit mining proposal, and from a massive gas pipeline. It has established forest units, El Bosque del Pueblo and Bosque La Olimpia, which are still managed by the community initiative today–– we changed the Island's forestry policy and catalyzing an increase of protected areas from a mere 3.7&amp;#37; to 8&amp;#37; of its surface. As more than 90&amp;#37; of the ecologically-sensitive land is in private hands, we believe that conservation initiatives and management initiatives with people are one and the same. \n\nA graduate of the public school system and of the University of Puerto Rico, I earned my doctoral degree from Michigan State University in 1994, where I worked in the laboratory of the director of the Center for Microbial Ecology, James Tiedje. As a faculty-member at the Department of Biology of the University of Puerto Rico Mayagüez Campus, I established the Tropical Microbial Ecology Lab, served as a principal investigator of microbial ecology projects with an emphasis on contaminated environment restoration, and mentored many students. \n\nWhen Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017, I worked together with Casa Pueblo to lead an ongoing community aid response. It aims to change the energy landscape of a country dependent on fossil fuels to one based on renewable energy sources. Casa Pueblo, which has operated with solar energy since 1999, served as an “energy oasis” during the storm, distributing over 14,000 solar lamps, solar refrigerators, and energized machines for respiratory therapy and personal dialysis. We also established a cinema, barber shop and classrooms, and energized rural mini markets and over 25 homes entirely with solar energy or hybrid systems incorporating wind and biomass. Community management—particularly the conservation of natural resources–– seeks to fulfill its global responsibility in facing climate change and social inequality, and I’m passionate about and proud to be a part of the movement.
