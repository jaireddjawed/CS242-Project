Only I dont know If this has been said alot but Its Okay to not know eeverything but smart studying Is Important. The 3 P's are IMPORTANT!!\n\nSo I started First Aid with BnB (and after half way got a pdf version of annotated version) and used that. Did Pathoma side by side (focused more on chap 1-3 and Brain tumors).\n\nDid Pixorize for Biochem and Sketchy for Micro.\n\nMy first NBME 25 did not go well (not gonna tell what I got cause it blew), then after my first pass of Uworld gave NBME 27 and got 56% and then watched dirty medicine videos and went through some of Mehlman pdfs and gave NBME 30 which was 61%.\n\nThen after 3 weeks of doing extra resources which Included stuff that I found here so next NBME was 70% and free 120 was 72%. \n\nFor those who have exams In a week or so try to stay off Reddit or any Social Media,even If It helps some of you there are some negative and confidence-breaking posts that you should avoid so you be you and just go In the exam center and give your best! And remember to take time reading the last part of Q and then reading the stem so you can effectively scan the statements.\n\nWill be sharing personally shared resource on my profile so It doesnt breach the rules as per say.\n\nI recommend sleeping proper for the night before the exam It helps you calm the nerves.\n\nGood Luck and Happy Studying!! Let me know If anyone starting and wants how to proceed. Happy to help.",

Nothing super concrete, but more of a \"Hey, we can add you to our list of students for when something becomes available.

I wanted to give the USMLE step 1 I told her about that, and even shared my study plan, I set up my Anki with a senior's help and helped her with her Anki setup.  \nI was added to a research group by some seniors because I could write manuscripts and do literature searches, other than that there is not one thing I did without her.  \nAll in all, she had been that kind of friend to me. 2 days ago, an intern at the hospital we're posted in, approached four of my friends, including her, for a research project. She might have told me about it on our way back home (we're neighbors) and maybe I forgot, or maybe she forgot to tell me. My other friends told me about it and I said she didn't tell me about it. I simply mentioned that and she burst out in a fit \" I don't gatekeep shit the way you do why would you accuse me of it\". I told her it was alright, I must've missed it, no big deal. I thought this was over. The next day in the morning, I saw her tweet calling me out as a \"gatekeeping snake\" and how I had the audacity to accuse her of gatekeeping.\n\nI'm broke in so many ways. I don't understand what happened, she acts all friendly still as if nothing happened. She didn't say another word to me about it and if I do end up asking what exactly I've been gatekeeping, I'm sure she wouldn't have a single answer to my question. I wish she had talked to me first rather than calling me out on a public platform.  \nDo you guys know how I should deal with this? any point to keep in mind? is it my fault? Is she jealous of my only research project? Am I in the wrong here? Should I apologize? when I think about it don't even know what to apologize about.  \nI know I shouldn't care about what people think of me but in a community like medicine, you have to be trustworthy enough for teamwork at least. She ruin that for me, out of all people, she did that?",

In particular, stress can cause a delay in the surge of luteinizing hormone (LH), which is the hormone that triggers ovulation. When ovulation is delayed, it can cause a delay in the start of the luteal phase.\n\nMy question is: Can acute stress AFTER ovulation trigger a delay in periods? And if yes, by which mechanism does this happen pease? \n\nTy!",

I love the content, I like the OR, and I get along with the people well. I have great mentors and my application is lined up for anesthesia.\n\nBut my brain keeps wondering if I should become a surgeon. It's so freaking stupid and I know it's a bad choice. I don't like anatomy, I hate operating for long hours, I hate suturing, I don't enjoy clinic, and I don't enjoy worrying about patients after work.\n\nYet I second guess my decision for one stupid reason: Prestige. I can't deny it. Saying you're a surgeon is pretty cool. Grey's anatomy and any medical drama show off surgeons as bad asses. I'm not saying I'm ashamed of anesthesia. Strangers I meet are impressed when I say I want to do anesthesia and always remark on how much I'll make.\n\nDeep down, I know I could do surgery though tbh. I know I could. I'm a strong student. I could learn the anatomy well. I could suck it up during residency with regards to the hours during residency and then fine a nice part of my surgery field where I only do elective cases that last less than 2 hours on average.\n\nAnyone have any advice or can knock some sense into me?\n\ntl;dr I know I'm happy with anesthesia but I can't shake off this stupid feeling of doing surgery just for prestige.",

        "text": "Y'all seemed to find some enjoyment in my pain so here are a few more.\n\n1. Peds.  I am doing a well child visit for a toddler with mom and dad.  I ask if child is feeding herself with her fingers.  Mom says \"yes, but she makes a mess.  Food everywhere.\" I respond \"that's good enough, I mean if I leave dinner with a clean shirt I call that a strong day.\"  Dad laughs.  Mom is not amused.  Child eats her fingers.  I awkwardly laugh and feel chest pain.  I need to stop making jokes at work.\n\n2. Peds.  Doing a well check for a couple young siblings with a parent.  I ask one about how he's doing and if he hangs out with any friends.  He says yes, he has made four friends in class.  I am happy and say \"wow! Thats more friends than I have!\" Small child looks at me with pure pity and says \"you don't have any friends?\"  I am trapped.  I have to either admit I lied or let 2 small children and their mom believe I am a loser.  \n\n3.  OBGYN.  I am in the OR.  Surgeon asks me to cut sutures.  No matter what I do I cannot cut the sutures.  They just slip between the blades every time.  I ask for a new pair.  I get a new pair.  They also slide like a coin taken from the underboob of a sweaty stranger.  I ask the resident if the scissors automatically become dull when I touch them.  She says I should blame myself, not the instruments.  I begin to have major performance anxiety about cutting sutures and leave that night having an existential crisis about my abilities. The next week I return and there are zero scissor issues.  I ask scrub tech Linda why they're so svelt.  They were sent off to be sharpened because they were all too dull to use.  I hope the resident hears but she is too busy being an asshole to someone else. \n\n4. Internal medicine.  I bleed all over my pants.  Resident sees. I see that resident sees. Go to change pants.  Accidentally turn faucet on and soak new pants before putting them on.  Am now standing in hospital basement bathroom in my underwear with no pants and no plan.  Rounds start in 10 minutes.  I show up to rounds with huge wet spot on my ass but at least its not blood.  Nobody says anything but I know they wonder if I pissed myself.\n\nBonus round from an SP encounter during M2:\n\nWe are practicing asking about vaginal complaints.  I mean to ask SP if she has experienced any vaginal issues recently such as unusual odor, discharge, etc.  Instead I say \"got any problems with your vagina?\" SP looks uncomfortable.  I am uncomfortable.  Everyone watching is trying not to laugh.  She says she does not know what I mean.  I am flabbergasted.  That may have been the most crass way possible to ask that but there is no way to misunderstand what I was saying.  I assume SP is stupid to preserve my self esteem.\n\nI promise I'm done and won't post another one of these but this is strangely therapeutic.",

        "text": "Trying to figure this out asap, as I still have not scheduled my exam(s) for this summer (late July).\n\nContext: I'm a third year medical student at a DO school in the south. I have a scored step 1 (222) and COMLEX Level 1 (520), as I was originally in the class of 2023. These scores are not horrible but clearly nothing to write home about. I presume nearly all applicants in my cohort in 2024 will have P/F scores only for Step 1, so I have no clue of having these scores will help or hurt me. Unfortunately, I had to take a LOA for medical reasons during third year, but I am now nearing the end of third year and have passed all my shelf exams/rotations thus far. Other than the LOA, I have no other red flags. Passed every single course first try during years 1 + 2 and, as stated above, am doing fine during year 3 (although burnout is setting in). \n\nI cannot get a single straight answer from anyone regarding whether or not I need to take both Step 2 and COMLEX Level 2 or if it's acceptable for psych to only take COMLEX Level II. Obviously only taking Level II is ideal. Taking both board exams back to back is a horrible experience that I would not wish upon anybody :(\n\nAny thoughts?",

        "text": "TL:DR - Friends and family questioning my choice of DO school instead of MD, taking a lot of the excitement out of my acceptance and causing a ton of anxiety.\n\nSorry for formatting, as I’m on mobile\n\nLate last year I took the MCAT and liked the score enough that I thought to apply to some schools, even though the MD deadline was almost there I simply applied to the DO schools with later deadlines. I thought, no matter what, I will work so goddamn hard I will be able to do whatever I want as a career. \n\nAnd a few months ago I finally got into a DO program that was and is still my top choice. I love everything about the program, the location, the structure of classes, the environment, and everything else. I have committed to the school and have been beyond happy and excited to begin this summer. \n\nUnfortunately, as soon as I told my friends and family that I was committing to this DO program they all suddenly became “concerned” if I was making the “right decision”. They talk about the slight difference in match rates in residency and the ever-present stigma of DOs and now every time I try to think positively and get excited about starting medical school I’m filled with dread about if I made the wrong choice.\n\nNow all I can think about is, should I have just waited to apply to MD schools? Should I not have taken the A? Am I really screwing myself? \n\nUntil this point, I acknowledged the differences between MD and DO schools, but I figured that because the program I got into regularly has their students match into competitive residencies, as long as I work my ass off I will be fine. \n\nRant over, but this has really put a damper on the fact that I got into freaking medical school. And everyone around me just seems to be concerned with if I made the right choice rather than just being excited for me, which kinda sucks.",

Besides, as a med student, I've heard this said so many times: 'xyz is a billing thing, don't worry about it until later.\" So then why am I writing notes for you?\n\nFurthermore, if I write a bunch of notes but still get 3 pimp questions wrong, it doesn't matter how much I 'helped the team.' My evaulation will still be mediocre. Whereas if you're an intern and your knowledge is lacking, you're given a pass.\n\nSo sure, you're helping out the intern. But most interns I've worked with don't seem to appreciate it. I feel like I'm looked at as a source of more work for them. Afterall, they'll be there 12-15 hours anyway. \n\nAnyway, it just seems to be a huge inconsistency with the medical school curriculum. I think note writing has slid into the process but I can't articulate why. It should be reserved for sub-I's who are trying to emulate the intern's life and workload. Not for core-rotation clinical students who are going to get a shit eval anyway if we don't know the answer to their pimping questions.\n\nI feel like most med students don't see it this way. We are all looking for publications and any avenue for an 'attaboy' that we can find. We like to play pretend doctor, which is understandable- it's why we're here. So that's why I think this is a hot take. But the way I see it is it is only a source of busy-work for us, not a credible source of learning.",

I'm wondering if I am being too ambitious and making a mistake, especially considering how I am in Canada and medical schools here are notoriously hard to get into. I have always wanted to be in the medical field, but to be honest I don't really have the work ethic or the intelligence. My average was an 82 last semester because I was dealing with personal issues and I didn't try as much as I should have. This semester is a 94, so far. I still procrastinate a lot and I don't have much interest in subjects other than science, which I have a 100 in right now (expecting it to drop). Last year I had a 97 average total. I can put in the effort if I want, but I just seem to have a mental block after a while. If this happens in medical school, I'm screwed aren't I? \n\nI have absolutely zero interest in other fields, everything else just feels bland to me. In my free time I read publications from my cardiologist because it's just what interests me. I also read studies about nutrition and lipids, which stems from my own issues with a genetic condition (HeFH). I am very passionate about medicine, but after reading so many medical school rejection posts and unmatched residency posts, I don't know if it's worth taking such a risk. Especially considering debt and effort, just to end up unhappy and rejected. It also feels like once you're in med school, you're trapped. And even though you're trapped, you can still not cross the finish line and all you'll be left with is debt and wasted time. Is that true?\n\nI currently want to be a pediatric cardiologist, and I have received a conditional offer to volunteer at a top pediatric hospital in the division of cardiology. Should I take it and continue pursuing my dreams or be more realistic? My parents are telling me that my goals are unrealistic and I don't know if I should listen to them. Others around me are supportive, even my own cardiologist and teachers. I'm sure they're just being nice to a great extent though. I guess I can still opt for nursing or dietetics at this point in time, which I know will be difficult too. It's just that my heart has always been set on being a doctor, but I still have yet to be hit with the real world and my odds of this actually happening.\n\nTLDR: If you were 15 again, would you make the same choices as before and pursue medicine?\n\nSide questions: \n\n1. Let's say I do make it this far, when applying to residency, would I rank cardiology first or pediatrics? Does it just depend on which one I'm more interested in?\n2. If one doesn't match into the residency program they want, let's say cardiology, does that mean they just can't do cardiology? That seems so crazy to me.",

Do you stick with this resource with each specialty? \n\nI used Anki a bunch in my first two years. Do I just suspend all my cards (would be finished with STEP1 by then) and start fresh? What decks do you recommend? \n\nIt seems like practice questions are also the way to go. Should I just buy uworld or is getting Amboss as well worth it? \n\nEven though everyone is different, would love to hear recommendations/opinions! Thanks!",
