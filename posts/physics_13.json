But when the traveler comes back, don’t they see a corresponding speed up?  And once they’re back together don’t they have the same exact count of clock ticks?     This is very unsatisfying.   Is the Doppler explanation not the right explanation for this?   And if you insert the right explanation - but still count clock ticks then where did the extra ticks some from? Or where did the missing ticks go?",

Getting to 50K feet jumps the number to (53) balloons! Does that seem correct? Is there that sharp of a curve in the thickness of the air?",

The water/air interface water molecules have a net force aiming outwards (outside of the alveoli) since there are no water molecules above them. Now, the confusion commences.\n\nWhy don't the water molecules coming in touch with the epithelial tissue of the alveolus also have a net force aiming inwards (The center of the alveolus)?\n\nHow do water molecules cause the collapse of the alveoli if the net force due to cohesive forces (hydrogen bonds) aims outwards and not inwards?",

        "text": "To accelerate any object at any rate, we have to apply force (thrust). This force must be greater than the forces working to decelerate the object (Drag). \n\nDrag is created by both external forces acting upon our object, such as air, and internal forces of the object resisting acceleration, inertia. For this thought experiment, I will assume that work is being done in a total vacuum; eliminating the external forces.\n\nThrust, as we know it, is generated by reactions, either physical or chemical, that apply force to a given object. This force is both equal and opposite in all directions. \n\nInertia, in the vacuum of space with no external gravitational or physical resistance, is not an absolute force. Meaning, it will never cancel a force completely. Rather it will affect the degree of the reaction.\n\nLight is a particle that has velocity but no mass. It's important to note that it does have a reaction when interacting with mass. I am not suggesting that lasers be used to propel spacecraft as that's too impractical, even for this fairly impractical thought experiment as the energy density required would take an immense amount of energy. However it is extremely important to note that massless particles can still apply force to an object as we'll see in this next part. \n\nMatter-Antimatter reactions obliterate mass and create particles that have energy and yet no mass. We have to remember the Law of Conversation which, put simply, states that matter can not be created nor destroyed, only converted. In the Matter-Antimatter reaction, mass is converted completely to energy. This produces energy at a density equal to the mass obliterated. Which can be extreme as evidenced by nuclear reactions. Also, Matter-Antimatter reactions can produce Neutrinos, a particle observed to be traveling near or at the speed of light. \n\nSo, in an environment with no particle or gravitational resistance, it stands to logic (mine at least) that a Matter-Antimatter reaction contained and focused, similar to rocket propulsion, could provide the velocity required to approach the speed of light. This is where we begin to encounter Time Dilation. \n\nTime Dilation is the theoretical phenomenon of experiencing time at a slower and slower rate as you approach the speed of light. Meaning, at such extreme velocity, you might experience the trip as being near instantaneous.\n\n Now, would an observer see your journey as taking multiple hours, days or even years or would the dilation in time affect their perception as well? Making the journey you take seem like a form of teleportation. We don't actually have an answer for this as we don't have enough actual evidence to prove either way but I am curious to your thoughts.\n\nGoing even further into hypotheticals, if you were able to harness a reaction that could propel you beyond the speed of light, would Time Dilation force you to experience time backwards? Would you go backwards faster as you further exceeded the speed of light? And, what effects would such a form of propulsion mean for the universe as you would effectively be producing a reaction beyond what we currently understand to be the limits of energetic force?\n\nAs for the question of this post as a whole, what are your thoughts on the logic used? Are there holes in it? And finally, what are your thoughts on possible extreme forms of travel?\n\nIf there's somewhere else I should put this, tell me",

        "text": "  \n\n## Constancy of the rate of passage of time versus constancy of the speed of light\n\nConsider a photon bouncing up and down between two mirrors, as system known as a light clock, where the clock has a velocity relative to the observer. The photon has a velocity component in the direction of travel, as well as an up/down speed, and the photon travels at the speed of the vector sum of horizontal and vertical speeds. \n\n### Bob and Alice’s light clock experiment\n\nBob and Alice each have a light clock. Bob and Alice are at rest. Bob speeds off with his clock and stops. Then Alice speeds after him and stops next to him. Whose clock is ahead? \n\n#### Either:\n\na) The vector sum is limited to the speed of light, and the up/down tick of the clock slows down, or\n\nb) The apparent speed of the photons in the clocks increases to something faster than the speed of light. \n\nFirst consider the assumption a) that the vector sum of the up/down and horizontal travel is the speed of light, and the passage of time changes with relative velocity. This means the up/down vector is reduced so that the clock ticks slower. Alice would see Bob’s clock slow down as he sped off, but from Bob’s point of view, Alice is moving away from him, so he would see Alice’s clock slow down. As Alice caught up to Bob, each would again see each other’s clock slow down because of the relative speed of each other’s clocks. In both cases, as the two clocks were separated and came together, each person would see the other’s clock slow down. Then both would see that each other’s clocks were slow. They can’t both be right. This scenario is impossible. \n\nNow consider b) Alice and Bob each sees the other’s photon speed up faster than the speed of light when Bob sets off. And each sees the other’s photon speed up while again as Alice catches up. The up down motion of the photon in both clocks stays the same throughout, but the apparent speed of light appears to increase in the other person’s clock. That is, the two clocks were synchronous throughout, and the passage of time remained constant for both Bob and Alice. \n\nIn this example, the photon is bouncing up and down, and the clocks are moving horizontally. Length contraction only occurs in the direction of travel, so it is not relevant here.\n\nTherefore, the passage of time does not change with relative speed. The rate of passage of time remains constant in both clocks, but the apparent speed that light leaving the surface of an emitter (the clock mirrors in this case) increases with relative speed between the observer and the emitter. **Contrary to Einstein’s thinking, time is constant, absolute, and universal.**\n\nWhere is my deliberate mistake?\n\nRe De Sitter's experiment. The opposite conclusion from De Sitter may also be drawn from his experiment from what he did. Light travelling from the twin stars travels at c across space relative to earth. One star (star 1) is moving towards earth at a speed of u, and the relative speed of light between the star and photon leaving its surface is, cr1, as seen from earth is cr1 + u. That is, cr1 + u = c, where c is the speed of light an observer on earth sees the light travel across space. Therefore cr1 is smaller than c, as seen from earth. Notably, cr2, the relative speed between a photon and the star from which it is emitted, travelling away from earth, is faster than the speed of light! While the speed of light relative to any observer is constant in zero gravity, the apparent speed of light relative to an emitter, depends on the relative speed of the emitter.",
