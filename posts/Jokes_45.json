Within minutes 5 police cars circle the car. A senior officer slowly approaches the car, clasping his half drawn gun.\n\nOfficer 2: Ma'am, could you step out of your vehicle please!\n\nThe woman steps out of her vehicle.\n\nOlder woman: Is there a problem sir?\n\nOfficer 2: My colleague here tells me that you have stolen this car and murdered the owner.\n\nOlder Woman: Murdered the owner? Are you serious?!\n\nOfficer 2: Yes, could you please open the trunk of your car, please.\n\nThe woman opens the trunk, revealing nothing but an empty trunk.\n\nOfficer 2: Is this your car, ma'am?\n\nOlder Woman: Yes, here are the registration papers.\n\nThe traffic cop is quite stunned.\n\nOfficer 2: My colleague claims that you do not have a driving license.\n\nThe woman digs into her handbag and pulls out a clutch purse and hands it to the officer.\n\nThe officer examines the license quizzically.\n\nOfficer 2: Thank you ma'am, but I am puzzled, as I was told by my officer here that you didn't have a license, that you stole this car, and that you murdered and hacked up the owner!\n\nOlder Woman: Bet the lying bastard told you I was speeding, too!",
