A separate survey of banking, insurance, and telecoms professionals published by SunTec found that the difficulty in recruiting skilled staff is the biggest obstacle to achieving business goals in 2022. Research published recently by Intel found a surprising lack of understanding around some of the most important technology trends, which are widely forecast to drive business success over the next ten years. It particularly found deficiencies in the understanding of AI, cybersecurity, and quantum computing. The report focuses on the UK but will be equally relevant to other developed countries – and it seems likely the problem will only be more pronounced in developing countries.\n\nWhy is there a digital/tech skill gap despite having the availability of so many resources to learn, and work on real-world projects (open source)?? Or is this simply the Dunning-Kruger effect??",

However, some of the technologies that are currently being researched and developed that may have a significant impact in the next decade include:\n\nArtificial General Intelligence (AGI) - AGI is a type of AI that has the ability to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can.\n\n\nQuantum Computing - Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize computing by solving problems that would take classical computers an impractically long time to solve.\n5G and 6G networks - The next generation of mobile networks (5G and 6G) are expected to bring faster internet speeds, lower latency, and improved connectivity.\n\n\nEdge computing - Edge computing allows data to be processed at the source, rather than being sent to a centralized location for processing.\n\n\nBlockchain - Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize a wide range of industries by providing secure, transparent, and tamper-proof transactions.\n\n\nAutonomous vehicles - Self-driving cars, drones, and other autonomous vehicles are expected to become more prevalent in the next decade, potentially transforming transportation and logistics.\n\n\nBiotechnology - Advancements in biotechnology, such as gene editing and synthetic biology, may have a major impact on healthcare and agriculture in the next 10 years.\n\n\nMixed Reality - The combination of virtual reality and augmented reality technology, known as mixed reality, is expected to become more mainstream in the next decade and could have wide-ranging implications for entertainment, education, and industry.\n\n\nPlease note that this is not an exhaustive list and there could be other technology that may come out and make impact in the near future.",

        "text": "How gig-workers (for Uber, Doordash, Lyft etc) instead of relying on working for a reliable wage, are gambling every time they go to work. Instead of a boss, like Bob, drivers have an algorithmic program run by artificial intelligence. AI uses algorithms to determine if a worker recieves work, and how much that worker is paid for that work. Effectively, this is a \"race to the bottom,\" where gig corporations pay as little as possible to workers while keeping them working for as long as possible. These gig workers are not paid for the time spent waiting between jobs, merely being \"online\" does not constitute paid time, thereby avoiding paying workers for their time spent waiting for a job. This seems to be a rapidly expanding practice, an alternative to employment and traditional payment of wages, spreading to other industries. AI programs are replacing management. \n\n\n\n***A new study identifies \"algorithmic pay discrimination\" on gig work platforms.***\n\n\nhttps://www.vice.com/en/article/dy7mpa/pay-algorithms-make-working-in-the-gig-economy-feel-like-gambling-study-says?utm_source=reddit.com\n\n\nSummary:\n\n&gt; Startups behind the so-called gig economy have spent millions of dollars transforming the nature of work from structured hours, pay, and benefits to an ad-hoc world of “independent contractors” whose boss is an algorithm. According to a new paper, haphazard algorithmic pay has turned having a job into something more like gambling.\n\n&gt; Rather than traditional wage discrimination, which involves paying someone a different wage based on their gender, race, or other protected categories, Dubal compares the pay schema of the big ride hail companies to consumer price discrimination, where people pay different prices for the same products depending on how much companies think they’re willing to pay.\n\n&gt;According to Dubal, Uber and Lyft are doing essentially the same thing with wages: paying drivers different rates for the same work based on what the companies think they’ll accept. They do this both through data collection on drivers and through the opacity of algorithms, which determine when drivers get a customer and how much they will be paid. \n\n\n&gt; In contrast, Dubal says, “The worker cannot know what the firm has algorithmically decided their labor is worth, and the technological form of calculation makes each person’s wages different.”\n\n&gt; “If we ban this kind of payment practice…at least in some context, it will disincentivize surveillance of work,” Dubal told Motherboard. Surveillance of workers has existed since the industrial revolution, but the type of digital surveillance used for algorithmic wage-setting is on another level entirely, she said.",
