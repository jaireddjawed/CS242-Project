        "text": "I view Christians sects as siblings of each other. I see that there are different positions among Christians about various topics. I'd like to learn about the contents of the Bible *and* the various theological ideas. I've found a lot of interesting and useful stuff already. For example, online courses that survey the old testament, or the new testament, etc. That is exactly the kind of thing I would be looking for.\n\nI'm concerned that I will be presented with a \"true interpretation\" style education. Thats not what I want. I want an honest, broad understanding of the different theologies and their connection to the Bible. Has anybody else tackled this before? Do you know of any good **objective** resources? Or should I just stop worrying and start study?",

        "text": "I attend a non religious discussion group each week with friends. The group is hosted by a pastor and his wife who have become good friends over the past couple years. It wasn't clear to me in the beginning where they stood on the spectrum of Christians, the group is quite liberal and I thought they were the sort of touchy feely new wave kind of Christians. Over time it became obvious that this wasn't the case and in fact they are old school bible literalists. \n\nA few times in my life when Christians have confronted me I really wished that I was better at defending myself as an atheist but even though I half knew some of the typical ammo I wasn't interested in studying up on the bible and researching christian stances for holes for the purpose of debate. It seemed like a lot of time investment for little return as wasn't trying to convert anyone and I don't enjoy arguing. \n\nCut to 2017, I feel like separation of church and state is under attack. I'm trying to figure out my role in defending atheism. These friends have said some things during the last 6 months which I feel like I can no longer ignore but they are not always directed at me so its not clear how to respond. Others have quietly separated themselves from them but I want to be a person who can maintain friendships with people who have even radically different views then me even though I sometimes find myself wondering \"how am friends with someone who believes xyz?\" To be fair I'm sure they have the same thought about me.\n\n**TLDR;** Does anyone have advice about how to have constructive conversations with devout christians about separation of church and state? Also how to politely counter pure christian nonsense without being condescending or argumentative?\n\nThank you for your help!\n\n",

        "text": "  My daughter is 6 years old and in 1st grade. I was raised christian and became agnostic then atheist around the age of 20, I am now 31. I haven't talked to my daughter much about religions yet, I thought I still had more time.  The extent of our conversations has been that many people believe in different god/s and some people don't believe in one at all. I have told her what I believe also.  We have talked about death and what happens after we die. I have always said that it is okay for people to believe differently and that's okay. \n\n  When she asks questions I also promote researching the answer and not just talking what \"I\" say as fact. I want her to think for herself. This morning we were waiting in the car line for school and she says: \"You know god made all of this!\" \nTo which I reply, \"Made what?\"\nHer:\"The cars,the school, the roads\"\nMe: \"Well, **** you know that people made the cars, buildings, and the roads. Don't you remember seeing the guys working on the roads we passed by earlier or the people building the new buildings downtown?\" \nHer:\"Yeah, but god made the people that do those things, so god really made them\" \"God is great and made everything\"\n\n\n  I questioned her about how god made the people and told her about how sometimes god is used to explain things we at the time can't explain. Like the sun and moon etc..and she told me that just because god is invisible does not mean he's not there. \n\n\n  I'm not really sure where all this is coming from. She really not been exposed to a lot of religion by me or her mother or other family members. Yet, they are very \"scripted\" answers I have heard from many people.\n\n  I'm not sure how do proceed. I don't want to teach her my way is the right way, but I also do not want her to think that \"God\" is the only way. I want her to be able to think for herself, do her own research and not talk things at face value.  It got me thinking about how hard it is to explain to her about the many different gods when the christian is hardly ever referred to by a name. Hes simply god implying there is only one. \n\n  Can anyone point me in the right direction? Kid friendly youtube channels that talk about different religions and evolution? Books? Discussion topics?  I am at a loss, I thought I had more time before approaching this subject and frankly i'm terrified i'll do the wrong thing.",

        "text": "Has anyone ever considered the idea that we ought to invent a religion that openly admits that its tenants are absurd to believe in, but are simply there as comforting and guiding fairy tales that you can believe, but design those fairy tales in a way in which, whether or not they are true, what you will be made to do would be identical to if you didn't believe the fairy tale.\n\nLike, here's an example: There is a god. This god exists in a metaverse in which it has the ability to create a universe within their own mind, but it is very difficult for this god to figure out how to perfectly fine tune a universe which he feels compelled to do. But then, one \"day\", they are able to create a universe which forms life that is able to actually feel emotion, and then, the emotion of that life, is felt by this god. This is the greatest feeling that God has ever felt, because it is the only thing they had ever felt. This God then decides to pursue a universe dedicated to recreating as much of this as possible. When you die your consciousness will be reabsorbed into God as the universe dissipates into nothing. This God will then use the universe in order to try and recreate that happiness, and will infer from it what they should do best to recreate it. If your consciousness is one that happens to believe in this sort of God, you will be instrumental in helping God create heaven: A heaven of the perfect universe built after what can be experienced and learned by a limited God.\n\nSo, in order to be convincing to God, you need to make him happy. And he is all beings, and thus you are duty and moral bound to do what will make the world the most happy. And you must accept the universe for what it is, because God is the universe, and God is not perfect, so The Universe is not perfect. But the next one can only be better if you make this one so too.\n\nAs far as I can tell, something like this would probably be the best option for society as we move into the future. Many people need something faith based, but we need it to clearly and explicitly conform to the nature of reality and logic. Whether or not it was true, such a religion would not affect how you would be obligated to act in reality by a logical moral standard. Because if there is no God, then you should still want to be happy, and because everyone else wants that, you should want to live in a society that creates the system that will maximise it for all people. No matter what, such a religion would have to have a thesis whereby it says that the religion should not make you behave how you otherwise would if it were not true.\n\nWould this be a good idea?",

        "text": "Hey all\n\n \n\nA long time ago, - 15 to 25 years ago - I was open minded about various religions, and various supernatural things. I wouldnt put myself as a believer, but Mulders poster in the X Files, would be a TLDR: \"I want(ed) to believe\"\n\n \n\nAs a child, I was brought up as Church of England, AKA Anglican. I’d got confirmed and was about 13 -14 before it just didn’t make any sense to me. So I left, tried to become open minded;  I did research into various parts of the occult, read up on religions. I owned various esoteric texts and other occult paraphernalia. At the same time I looked briefly into other religions, though, I must admit, felt that once you had tried one Abrahamic Religion, you’d tried them all. I spent my years from 15 through to my mid-twenties (IE most of the 90’s) reading books and trying to find out more. I found friends who I could discuss this with and spend many a night discussing it. I tried a lot of Hallucinogenic drugs and noted the similarity between my Dreams that I kept Dream diaries of and the images I saw while on the drugs.\n\n \n\nThing was, all religion and supernatural magic’s just felt hollow, nothing substantial to believe in that couldn’t be ascribed to something more real. The fact that I had had nothing supernatural happen to me, nor had any proof of anything that I could not describe as woolly thinking, just laid weight to that thought process.\n\n \n\nSee, growing up, I wanted to believe so much. The world felt nasty and horrible, and everyone so selfish. I guess the Christian, \"there is something better after\" and the idea of justice for injustice, really burnt its way into my psyche. But not believing in Heaven or Hell, nor believing in any non-factual reward system was incredibly hard on that same psyche. \n\nSo I changed my point of view; I honestly felt then that perhaps that human scientists were the way out of this, by trying to create a better world – an almost Star Trek Utopia – if it could be imagined then it would be possible in one form or another. (Im talking about the Utopia side – not specific science, but where there are no poor, with infinite resources and space, we can be the people that we would like to be). This literally made me feel happy in the way that I knew that the future could be bright.\n\n \n\nThe thing is, after I lost my open-mindedness with everything supernatural, I began to lose my faith in humanity. I kept and keep reading of people making Xenophobic decisions, people actively ignoring the scientists or being SO greedy that they actively squash anything that might make the world a better place.\n\n \n\nSo, now I look at the world and feel that it is FUBAR. I don’t see us as a species ever evolving above our base natures. Humans are inherently flawed and selfish, and they do not want to share, only to be better than their neighbour. That Organised Religion has become corrupt (for the same reasons) and that there is no afterlife.\n\n \n\nSo, my fellow atheists and or agnostics, what do you do to keep yourself from being utterly miserable at how the world is turning out?\n\n \n\nTLDR the search for answers did fulfil me for a while, but my inherent lack of faith in humanity makes me ask, whats the point?",

Mostly, I'm genuinely curious about what sorts of things you guys have to say.\n\nAgain, I'm not asking for why you disbelieve in Christianity, but instead, what are some of the aspects of the culture surrounding it that rub you the wrong way?",

I am, as a marxist, very confused when atheists don't take the next step from believing in a rational, materialist world, to realizing the material roots of belief systems and ideology and becoming marxists/dialectical materialists.\n(xposted here because this may be a more fitting subreddit to discuss this /debate)",

So anyway, we are at the mall and we were accosted by a girl in her 20's trying to recruit us into to some church.  She was with a guy, but she was doing all talking.  Normally, if I were alone, I would just keep walking and say \"not interested\" or whatever, but my daughter and her friend stopped and listened intently while she talked and pointer to text on her phone.  I just stood there awkwardly wondering if I should interrupt this girl who was just rattling of all sorts of crazy semi-christian stuff where she mentioned the bible, but also god-mother and 4 spirits at the 4 corners of the earth and other really weird ideas.  Then she mentioned that the bible is older than science and I'm thinking \"oh no she didn't\" and was about to pounce when my daughter just spoke up suddenly, and was \"let me stop you right there, I'm an atheist\".  The girl tried some more but we just walked away.  I was so proud at that moment.  I've never even said the word \"atheism\" with my kids and I just wanted to say that it is the natural result of just sticking with reality and facts, and maybe a little critical thinking thrown in here and there.  \"How do you know that?\" and the line of questioning that follows does wonders in a young brain.  There is hope.",

That's why I thought \"what an ironic coincidence\" when I saw the ad for [a sermon series titled that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Efu6V6p2hr8), and then only to find a whole bunch more religious references to that phrase online.\n\nOf course, they do seem to deal with the same topic from opposite angles. Theists see faith as precious defense from \"the enemy\", from the war on their beliefs and all they hold dear. They supposedly hold a \"destined\" position of \"justice\", for which they will secure \"victory\" through the \"Armor of God\".\n\nTo atheists, the \"war\" is simply observations of reality and availability of evidence, which we \"succumb to\" /s and adjust our behavior and beliefs accordingly. And the \"armor\", like Greta wrote, \"protects\" the believer from reality check, justifying any behavior and belief despite the evidence.\n\nWhat's more ironic is that theists certainly do make use of the same tools to distinguish truth and lies, protect themselves from con tricks and false advertising, and of course, from other religions they don't follow.\n\nI think this attitude supports my suspicion: that despite what they think, theists emphasize on faith because they do not know their beliefs and claims to be true, compared to anything else they know to be true. They frame faith as a virtue, to convince themselves that what they believe must be true and justified, and that it will defeat other \"false\" claims despite the lack of evidence.",

Im a little disappointed but also happy because I hit a wall with my arguments that I couldn't get past, and I'm really looking forward to breaking through that barrier with your help. \n\nSo basically a large problem I have with religion is the necessity of faith and the eventual disregard for reason. I see that reason and faith are separate. I see looking at the facts and thinking something had a high probability is reason. I see that looking at the facts and seeing that something has a low probability but still believing, is faith. \n\nThe problem I'm having is that not everyone shares that distinction and its causing issues when I try to argue. \n\nFurthermore, I find that everyone (unsurprisingly) thinks that they have reasoned through the facts to reach their conclusion. As such when I try to say that believers of religion do so through faith, they can't comprehend anything they are using but reason. \n\nSo I guess it really comes down to (since everyone believes they are using reason), is evidence for religion strong enough vs evidence for atheism/evolution. But then they will say that reaching **any** type of conclusion is done through faith. And I really don't know what to say. \n\nI'm sorry if that wasnt clear, I'm very confused about the whole ordeal and it makes me pretty unsettled when I can't think about things straight. I'd appreciate any type of response, and thank you in advance!",

        "text": "The most annoying argument i see are usually quite harmless. It is not vile, idiotic or necessarily stupid. It comes from people i often see as well intentioned, respectful and caring theists or \"spiritual\" people. It usually boils down to this: \n\n\"I believe in God, but not like an old man in the sky, more like a mystical force or higher being beyond out comprehension\". First off annoying because most atheists already understand the concept of not taking texts too literally, but mostly because these kind of theists seem to miss the overall point. We dont just find the idea of a magical sky daddy silly, we find the idea of all gods silly. Most atheists in that category also find the idea of magic or the supernatural to be a silly or redundant concept. In many circumstances it does not mean anything if it is supposed to be a literal being or close to a philosophical concept such as: Armageddon, Valhalla, Karma, Heaven, miracles, giants, centaurs etc. \n\nAs an example: \n\n\"I believe in Zeus, but not like a man who throws lightning, i think he is nature itself manifesting into lightning.\"\n\nThe difference is that we actually understand a lot about lightning so its not the best equivelence, but the concept is the same. You think you can make your idea sound better by giving vague descriptions and trying to explain God or Zeus as something different or alligorical. Its like making up for a christmas gift consisting only of a paper box by wrapping it in further gift paper. It looks a bit prettier and less dumb, but there is still the same general lack of substance. \n\nI see it all the time, but i know i cant lash out at someone who is not trying to be a snarky asshole. Which is why i kind of resist the urge to respond to those anwsers and let it out here. ",

Very, very unlikely but possible. Or you call it a theory, like the Big Bang, in science. There are some proves to it but at the end the Big Bang still doesnt explain what started the bang. I for mine love to look at science and history, when I explain things for myself. And both have shown from the past till now, that they dont have a reliable answer to the big evidence ,that there had to be a start when there is a thing we call existence.\n\nTl;dr: How can a atheist ignore one theory for 100% sure if there has to be an answer to it if you accept existence. And at the end we just know too little now, from a scientific point to exclude any theory or to be certain about any at the same time? And science gives us only theories till now too?\n\nEDIT: Who to what thx to Zazanzo",

        "text": "I guess I'm asking for advice? Some input? I'm going to be totally honest about what I've been feeling lately, so this post may be kind of long, but please, bear with with me. \n\nI'm going through an extremely frustrating and confusing time in my life. I feel like I'm being suffocated by my own mind. Constantly, I am questioning everything I believe in, and I worry that it's starting to rob me of my identity. I read somewhere that stripping someone of their individuality is the worst thing you can do to someone, and man, whoever said that was spot fucking on.\n\nJust to give a little bit of background before I begin spilling my guts, I was raised in a non-religious household. My parents weren't necessarily Atheists, but they weren't Christians, either. Religion was largely unimportant to them, yet for some reason, for most of my childhood, I was raised as a Christian. Not a very strong one, of course - we didn't go to church, I was given a secular education, yada yada - but nevertheless I identified as a Christian until about age 12. By then, my father had begun pulling me aside and talking to me about religion in general. I'm not going to go into full detail because frankly it's not important, but he essentially gave me an education about the various world religions, about atheism, science, his own opinions, etc. He encouraged me to read about those subjects and to start coming to my own conclusions about life, and I did. Slowly, I began to reject Christianity and religion in general, and eventually I shifted over from Christianity to Deism, and from Deism to Agnosticism, and finally, from Agnosticism to Atheism. By that time I was about 14, and had formed extremely strong, secular opinions about the world. \n\nDespite my lack of faith, I felt an extreme connection to the world. I had a very logical, science based view, and what that gave me was a perspective where even something as insignificant as an ant became a wonder. I used to look up at the night sky and at the stars in sheer awe and euphoria, but now, I have none of that. Instead, for what ever reason, I am unable to feel that same joy I used to feel. Instead, those feelings have been replaced with doubt, skepticism and fear. \n\nThis all started after I went to a week long church event with a friend. I went mainly out of boredom and curiosity. I didn't have very much first-hand knowledge of what Christians believe, and I figured that this experience would be a good learning experience for me, and it was. I initially set out to have a better understanding of the belief system in general, but something happened that I didn't quite anticipate. All of those people coming together through song, prayer, and whatever else, touched me. It was beautiful. This led me to ask myself, \"what if all of these people are right, and I'm actually wrong?\" I mean, I had an idea of what Christians believed in beforehand, but I guess seeing those beliefs in action had an affect on me.\n\nEven months after the church event ended, that thought lingered in the back of my mind. The idea of hell terrifies me to my core. I guess I let this fear get the better of me, and it just spiraled out of control. Now I find myself getting uneasy at the sight of religious imagery, like a cross, which makes me even more uneasy because it makes my mind ask why I'm feeling the way I feel because of an inanimate object. I know there are people who would say that it's God trying to directly communicate to me, or that I'm possessed, too, which makes me feel even more afraid. I know these feelings are irrational, but they won't go away. Why? What in the hell is the source of all of this? \n\nMy mind is in a constant battle with itself now. I argue with myself all of the fucking time. I'll catch myself trying to argue against scientific fact in favor of religious dogma, and then switching views and defending the scientific fact while attacking the religious dogma. And it never. ends. I have completely lost the ability to feel at ease. \n\nAs a result of all of this, I don't know what to think or who to trust. Rationally, I have an extremely hard time accepting the fables in the Bible and other religious texts as the truth for reasons that would be extremely redundant to repeat on this particular sub. Yet, there is something that is pushing me towards(?) those same beliefs that I find to be asinine. Is there a word to describe what I'm feeling? Am I just weak willed, or am I going crazy?\n\nAnyway, I apologize for the monolith of text, and I apologize if this post doesn't fit the general theme of the sub. I'm trying to get my stuff figured out.\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for such thoughtful responses! \n\n\n\n\n\n",

They tell her that a three-pronged relationship (man, woman, holy spirit) is stronger than a regular one, that we might have it good but it'll never be as good as it could be with God, that eventually I'll mess up and she'll see why it is better to date a Christian, etc. Really nothing unique here, and I don't want to present her parents in a terrible light because they are otherwise the most kind, Christ-like people I know. They just take their beliefs seriously, and well, some of those things are at least implied in the Bible.\n\nI just need some advice on how to handle the situation. I don't want to challenge their ideas directly because it won't work, and it's not my goal to persuade them that they're wrong. I am fine with their faith especially because it is a positive thing in their lives. I don't want my relationship with her parents to be antagonistic in any way. Is there some angle from which I can approach the topic that can help us find some common ground?\n\nMy girlfriend sent me this today, which discusses an old testament passage regarding intermingling with sinners and non-believers: http://www.bible.ca/ef/expository-2-corinthians-6-14-18(2).htm\n\nJust to stress, things are great between my girlfriend and me, and we are very open about our spirituality. But her family is very dogmatic, so they have trouble understanding. There is plenty of FUD regarding atheism.",

He continues to participate in a student Christian organization.  Seeing him deal with ever present feelings of guilt and shame that stem from his faith surprises and concerns me.  The thing that straight up confused me was that he consulted with a priest and spent a few weeks ensuring he was in the right spiritual place before going on a date with a girl who asked him out.\n\nMaybe I just dislike the brand of Christianity my roommate and his friends ascribe to, but I am growing to see conservative branches of religion as inherently bad.  I see people with far more liberal beliefs seem to benefit more from the basic Christian tenets.  I don't want to be resentful.  I want to be accepting, but what I'm seeing seems so backwards and harmful to both practitioners and those around them.  How do I do that?",

        "text": "**Just to clarify, I'm really looking for the best approach or subject to address, not necessarily an exact response.  My title and formatting suck :(**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm not sure if this is the best place to seek help on how to respond to a specific discussion I've been having, but I'm hoping some of you might be able to help.\n\nI've been conversing back and forth with a friend about their god belief.  I'm not sure how to categorize their belief and thought that it might be easiest if I just post a couple of brief responses from this person.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen pressed to define god, here is a quick summary I made of their response  -   \n     \n     I began to feel more comfortable with this concept that \"I am God\" because whatever I see in someone else is a reflection of myself back to me.  Now, I see God as you and me and everyone/everything else. This might evolve for me, though. I suppose I could say that \"God\" is my relation to life in all time and space. Forgiveness, compassion, love, kindness, understanding.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm sure you can already see where this is going...  When I asked for clarification, and how they distinguish between god and \"relation to life\", they responded with  -  \n\n     To me, it's one in the same... No separation. To me, separation is an illusion that we see in the physical world. Energetically, though, there's no \"this\" or \"that.\" It's all one... Which is what I call God.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI finally got them to agree to a loose definition I gave, which was **\"God is not a distinct agent that interacts with the universe in any noticeable way, but is rather a label you use in place of what you are describing as your 'relation to life', which might be understood as a list of virtues in which you'd like to live your life by (Forgiveness, compassion, love, kindness, understanding)\"**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter some more back in forth, I thought we had made some progress, and then they dropped this reply...  \n\n     God is not a separate entity from anything. There are a lot of spiritual doctrines that believe this to be true and I'm grateful to have been introduced to them over the years. We can intellectualize and philosophize it all we want, but when it comes down to it, it's a higher consciousness that does not use the mind's intelligence, but uses the soul's intelligence. We can use our minds to try to understand it, which is helpful, but it's a deeper soul knowing / faith. God / higher consciousness / The Universe / energy / Love / source.. It's all the same meaning to me and many other people. The experience of suffering (anywhere on the suffering spectrum) comes from the idea that we are separate, which is not the ultimate truth. We see this truth in humanity, in empathy, compassion and connection.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThere is so much wrong with that last response, I don't know where to begin or how I should respond.  I don't think this person really has a well understood definition of God and is being rather vague and loose with words.  I would typically move on but I think this person is genuinely open to discussion.  Any recommendations on the best way forward, or most effective way of engaging the many errors?",

I didn't care much that I believed a baby had some immoral soul. I simply believed all humans had a right to life and human fetuses were still human. Now that I am an atheist I am still very torn about this topic. On one hand I have no desire to strip a woman of her rights over her own body but on the other hand I see that there is life inside the woman's body that has no advocate. I've heard people say that a fetus is just a clump of unthinking cells. These cells however are alive and human. We too are just a lump of cells if you think about it, and our ability to think is only an illusion. To me it seems we have a case of right to life vs right to choose. Doesn't the right to live supersede the right to choose? I am not bringing this up to try and sway anyone. What I'd like help with from you guys is how do you justify pro life? If I'm wrong, I'd like to know why. My opinion on this seems to go way against the grain of the majority of my fellow atheists. I'd also like reasons that rise above the common rhetoric that is heard on the news. To be pro life is not anti choice and to be pro choice is not pro death. I'm not looking to spark debate here. I just would like some well thought out reasons to help me process this through. \n\nEdit: Thanks for all your input on this. I had hoped for a reasoned discussion and I definitely got that. I was a little afraid I'd get pounced since this is such a huge issue and I know on other non theist type subs I would've been pounced so thank you. I learned quite a bit from the responses. Being a prolife atheist means I have had no one to bounce my ideas off of. Without discussion, how can one know whether their ideas are out to lunch right? I think the arguments that made me think the most were to think about judging the value of a human life on their personhood instead of their biology. I'm not quite swayed yet but I have a lot to think about. Thank you. \n\n\n\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/5j2thw/i_wrote_a_paper_on_the_secret_handbook_of_the/",
        "text": "\n*F.O.C.U.S.’s False Friendship with the Contemporary Catholic Church*\n\nQuick Outline: \n\n1. New Evengelization vs. Vatican II reformers\n2. Goal of FOCUS\n3. Missionary Position\n4. Deceitful Disciplers \n\n\n\nOver the past two decades, the Roman Catholic Church has suffered a major setback in the number of young people pursuing the vocation of the priesthood. To combat this decline, Pope John Paul II spoke to Curtis Martin and issued the ‘New Evangelization Movement’ to push young people towards the vocation of Holy Orders. Under Curtis Martin, the Fellowship of Catholic University Students spread across America, mostly at secular university and colleges. In its first 15-year presence on mostly secular institutions, it has already fostered over 395 vocations, with 285 men entering the seminary . Currently, there are 500 FOCUS missionaries on 113 campuses . This paper will focus, no pun intended, on the methods that these missionaries perform, as well as analyzing the message that FOCUS puts forth in their ‘secret’ Student Leader Handbook. Before I go into the main topic, I will lay out important statistics that will frame the current crisis and landscape that the Catholic Church is confronting. \n\n\t\nSince the Vatican II reforms (1962-1965), there has been a contested rhetoric in how the Catholic Church should adapt in the post-modern era. A majority of the 16% of millennials who self-identify as Catholic desire contemporary reforms in facets such as the vow of celibacy for priests, role of women in the priesthood, as well as various social issues ranging from gay marriage to abortion.  Since 1965, there has been a decline of exactly 21, 440 active priests in the United States.  Yearly priest ordinations dropped from 994 in 1965 to 442 in 2000, resulting in a drop of active diocesan priests from 94% to 63% . However, as the number of active parishes decreased in this time (-400) and former Catholics increased (+23 million) significantly, the priestly ordinations rose to 548 in between 2000-2016 . If more Catholics and parishes are leaving the Church than ever before, why is there a current increase in religious vocations? The most fascinating statistics are the number of parishes without a resident priest (549 in 1965 to 3,499 in 2016), as well as the huge rise in the number of deacons (898 in 1975 to 18,173 in 2016) . With all of these numbers bouncing in one’s head, anyone can come to the major conclusion: the Catholic Church requires priests to function, and young people have no desire to become priests. This is where FOCUS comes into the picture. \n\n\nIn 2009, Wikileaks obtained a copy of the secret Student Leader handbook given to missionaries of FOCUS. In this document, it gives out deceitful and non-sourced information, as well as outlines how to manipulate vulnerable college students into their fold. In the introduction, there are tables and charts to keep track of possible members, as well as a number of “accountability questions” for leaders/”disciplers” to ask their ‘disciples’. For women, it asks \n\n* Are you partaking in parties where your presence could be considered scandal?\n* Do you live beyond reproach? i.e. night curfews unless hanging out in groups\n* Do you allow yourself to get caught up in hopeless romantic movies i.e. chick flicks? \n\nFrom the start, the student leaders are taught to interrogate and manipulate through these awful questions. Right after, the handbook says “if you get any ‘instructions’ that are contrary to any moral law or Catholic teaching, discard them immediately”  as well as “try to avoid books that are more academic in nature” . In most university settings, it is the goal of every student to approach work in an academic way, so they intend to censor a new member’s intellect in this atmosphere. They even go so far as to say “all roads offered by the serpent, that is to say, mundane knowledge, fail” . When it comes to pursuing a degree, they simply say “if we find ourselves worrying about finding a job after graduation, we place this anxiety in the hands of Our Lady by praying”, as well as labeling “stopping by the financial aid office to check on a student loan payment” as a “neither urgent nor important” action . It comes to no surprise to hear that many FOCUS missionaries depend on charity and donations outside of FOCUS to continue their work, despite the total revenue of FOCUS reaching $30 million in 2014, nearly a 250% increase of net profit compared to 2013 . Meanwhile, salary and wages accounted for 58.6% of its expenses . This may be seen as a pleasantly surprising statistic, but one must take into account that FOCUS has 500 missionaries, whose average income is around $29,000 a year.  With these numbers, FOCUS would spend $14.5 million on its missionaries; however, some missionaries admit that they must fund-raise a livable wage . This results in many questions in how FOCUS truly spends their accumulated budget while staying as a registered and fairly well-reviewed non-profit. \n\n\nThe handbook’s use of fear and delusions of grandeur towards its student leaders is alarming. Already in Chapter One, it says “if you are in a state of grace, the Lord is literally inside of you. It is impossible to mess up” . This statement goes against basic canon law, but masques it with clever wording. It is true, dogmatically speaking, that, when accepting the Eucharist, the lord is inside of you, but that does not mean it is impossible to mess up by any means. On the same page, the handbook says “the evil one will then concentrate on ruining your silence” , and later reads “we live in a loud, godless society where the devil’s big lie is that there is a tomorrow” . This instills a sense of urgency to their mission and resentment to our current culture that is continually straying away from organized religion. The book dictates that “the next ‘step’ is learning to discern the real voice of God—and learning to ignore all other voices. The other voices usually tell lies tricked up to look like truth” . This is a key sentence in this book for two reasons. First, the book later says how “God can use a FOCUS movement”  and “how he (God) will bring those to us whom he has chosen” . This allows the leaders to feel a sense of empowerment that God is actually affirming their decisions in the recruitment process. Secondly and most disconcerting, the handbook reads “God can use us as student leaders within FOCUS to be instruments in His hands to do good works that will have consequences that echo for all eternity” . In summation, FOCUS tells these student leaders that God is not only in them, but is using them personally to further the FOCUS mission and save the Church. \n\n\nIn this section, I will show how they grab Bible study members to become their ‘disciples’. The handbook dictates that a leader must use a personal testimony that “presents a unifying theme (ex: loneliness in college), avoids using loaded words and phrases (follow the spirit, indwelling of the trinity, vocation, sacraments, quiet time, dark night of the soul), and is free from lingo and dense terminology (“sin”, “tabernacle”, “Eucharistic adoration”)” . \n\n\nAs their excuse of not speaking on any technical Catholic dogma, they say that the speaker must come across as “real and ordinary” . Almost mimicking Scientology in their vague approach to the Catholic Church, they instruct leaders to NOT bring up all of the most important aspects and basics of the Catholic Church: the Catechism and the sacraments, which is the ‘rulebook’ and rituals of the whole faith! After reading this, it came to no surprise to also read that “the power of ritual is that they insure that we use as little conscious energy as possible”  In addition, it says “even if the participants do not perhaps understand every word of the liturgy, they perceive the profound meaning, the presence of the mystery, that transcends all words” . In the dictionary, perceive means “to attain awareness or understanding of”, but their definition is devoid of the word’s actual meaning. Finally, they assert these leaders must “gain valuable information that will help us find the point of intersection between his or her story and the story of Christ and his Church” . The leaders hear the freshmen’s background, desires, and sufferings in order to develop an interpretation that will fit them. \n\n\nIn this section, I will outline the methods of FOCUS’ missionaries in discovering disciples and how they are in fact immoral and somewhat sadistic. \nWe must begin with the end in mind…We desire to share the Gospel of Jesus Christ through small Bible studies, and to “spiritually multiply” ourselves by finding two disciples of our own by investing specifically in member of our study who are fit for leadership themselves” \t\nWhile it may sound innocent enough like any other Bible Study, they emphasize how the goal is to “win, build, and send”  through what they call natural friendship. They calm the leaders’ worries by saying that “through friendship we, in a sense ‘win the right’ to invite students to our Bible Study….Next phase of outreach: systematic follow-up” . This follow-up consists of “setting nature and grace goals” due to the fact that “individuals need to be willing to be held accountable to the correction of their discipler” . The handbook even warns not to rush into inviting them to Bible Study but “only after spending significant time and energy investing in your students” . How can they call this a friendship if their goal is to bring a freshman into their bible study, which leads to them persuading an individual to pursue one of two vocations: seminary or missionary? If that is their beginning and end goal, how can they call it a natural friendship? Even before this, they lay out how \nSocial scientists suggest that college students make upwards of 90% of their friends and time commitments within the first three weeks of their freshman year. Consequently, the window of opportunity to invite new students into FOCUS on your campus is extremely narrow” \n\n\nWith unsubstantiated evidence that is never cited, this excerpt reiterates this sense of urgency that the leaders and missionaries must focus on recruitment quickly, while also taking their time to influence two people specifically in becoming their ‘disciples.’ Holding people accountable to FOCUS’ goals, not telling a new person up-front that they are befriending you solely for their Bible Study, and primping you for holy life is downright duplicitous. \n\n\nAs I analyzed the chapters of how FOCUS tells its leaders to recruit, it becomes apparent that they use loaded phrases and manipulation in order to confuse specifically targeted and fragile individuals. The handbook’s chapter titled **The Art of Asking Intentional Questions** immediately gave me chills. In its pages, it describes how the student leaders must “know how they (freshman) think and what they fear. We must know what motivates and inspires them, what discourages and degrades them”. FOCUS even sets themselves from other Catholics by drawing a fine line between “so-called ‘good’ Catholics”  and their own mission. Since FOCUS boasts such a high number of ‘fostered’ vocations, it is apparent that, eventually, FOCUS-fostered priests may end up leading the church in the future. What will happen to the dividing line between laypeople and the clergy’s beliefs on reforms and social issues? \n\n\nAfter all of its hypocritical wordplay, deceitful tactics, and ‘us vs. them’ mentality towards the current Catholic Church, the handbook’s main message is ultimately an ironic one. Curtis Martin, the founder of FOCUS, says that \"the truth is, whether we recognize it or not, there is a war raging in the heart of every student whom you pass as you walk to classes each day. If we see things rightly, we realize that there is more at stake than we can fathom, and that our decision to follow Christ is not something that involves 'me and Jesus', but potentially thousands of other souls whom God could reach through us if we allow him to do so.\"\n\n\nTwo pages later, the founder admits “the battle is the Lord’s—and it is already won” . After saying everything in how urgent and needed their mission is in today’s declining religious landscape, he emphatically states that no matter how much we try, the outcome will stay the same. My main goal in this paper is not to harp on missionary groups in general, but to point out the false and immoral practices prominently used mostly by the New Evangelization Movement, and, most of all, FOCUS. One important key fact is that there is a contested rhetoric in this movement even amongst Catholics; for example, FOCUS has no presence on Jesuit campuses, which usually lean left of the political and social spectrum. Finally, FOCUS’ student leader handbook is a two-faced and manipulative textbook for missionaries to appeal to fragile freshman just beginning life on their own, more often than not in a new place with new people.\n\n\n**Here are my sources** (this originally had footnotes after each quote/excerpt):\nhttps://wikileaks.org/wiki/Fellowship_of_Catholic_University_Students_(FOCUS)_Student_Leader_handbook,_2008\nhttp://site.focus.org/news-for-you/september-2013/fifteen-years-of-focus-vocations.html\nhttps://focusoncampus.org/join-staff\nhttp://religiondispatches.org/why-the-church-is-struggling-to-hold-onto-millennial-catholics/\nhttp://cara.georgetown.edu/frequently-requested-church-statistics/\nhttps://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/841522811\nhttp://www.indeed.com/cmp/Fellowship-of-Catholic-University-Students\n",

        "text": "I'm sorry if this is unclear, it's just thoughts I've been having the for past few months, and finally needed to put them all down.  \n  \nMany theists don't follow the notion that Judaism, Islam and Christianity all follow the same god. I myself don't believe that to be true either. Let me try to explain a little bit of my thought process.\n  \nJudaism, Christianity and Islam all claim to praise the god of Abraham. Judaism began the tale. Then Christians built on it. Added some new characters, and changed some of the lore around. Then Muslims added a few more characters, and once again changed some lore.  \n  \nThe best analogy I could come up with is comparing the religious origins of each branch with Lord of the Rings (LotR).\nThe LotR books are first established (Torah). The story is set. Has a beginning an end, and even some other lore that the original author wrote.  \n  \nWhat if someone today was to write Lord of the Rings 2? Would it be accepted as part of the original lore? What if a large portion of people loved it? Would that new lore become canon?\nIs the Bible and related texts the LotR2 to the Torah's LotR? I have a hard time saying that LotR2 would be canon, and should be treated as the same story anymore.  \n  \nThen yet another group decided to add even more onto the story with the Quran. LotR3 if you will. \n  \n I don't understand why people say the Christian/Islamic texts are canon to the original material. They were based on the same characters, but were made by completely different authors at completely different times.  \n  \nMy second argument would also include the \"truths\" of each god. One example would be the claim of Jesus' existence.  \nA Jew would claim that their God has never had a direct son. The Christian would claim that their God has a son who he gave to Virgin Mary. The Muslim would claim that their god also has no son. Are these theists describing the same character if some of their biggest attributes are conflicting?",

Just thought I would share it to get things off my chest.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;So my fiance visited a family whose son he was really good friends with during childhood. My fiance even considered them his second family. This is the first time he's visited them in years. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Things went well a first. The typical \"catching up\" questions, but then they brought up homosexuality... since they have since learned that my fiance is in an openly gay relationship with me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;My fiance said they kept lecturing him repeatedly about how it was a sin, he was going to hell, and that he's lost his way from Jesus. They quoted verses to him that supposedly condemn homosexuality. They even told him that while I may not be ready to breakup, that he (my fiance) should do it anyway so that we both may have an easier time coming back to Christ. This honestly enraged me at first for several reason.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The first being, my fiance has only recently become comfortable being openly gay with anyone. He had a very negative response from his family when he first came out.(Thankfully they're very accepting of both of us now) I was terrified this might scare him into wanting to hide again. Thankfully, he says it has not.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Secondly, my fiance still professes to be a Christian (although even he says he's just holding onto the religion by a string after having many conversations with me over Christianity). I use to be a Christian myself, and I honestly thought it was extremely judgmental and non Christ-like for them to decide that solely being gay was sending him to hell AND that breaking up with me was the best course of action. Who are they to say that? What authority do they think they have to command my fiance to break up with me? If I was still a Christian, I would have said that my fiance's homosexuality was between him and God to decide. It should be no one else's business. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Third, they said the reason I left God was because I was gay. This is far from the truth, and they don't even know me. Who are they to say why I left Christianity?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Fourth, they have a son, my fiance's old childhood friend, about our age (24) who has never accomplished anything. Dropped out of high school, never went to college, hardly worked any job, still lives at home, and he's a drug addict. But according to them, he's perfectly fine and loved in God's eyes. Nothing for him to change. But my fiance, who works part-time, goes to college full-time, still helps at his church, and volunteers is going to hell because he loves another man. The logic makes me sick.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Anyway, I think that's all. Thank you for reading my rant. I just thought I would share it. My fiance says he doesn't think he'll be visiting them again. So that's a positive.",
