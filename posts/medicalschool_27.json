I‚Äôve been bear crawling around my apartment this weekend since walking makes it worse, sends horrible pain down my leg, which then gives out and I almost fall.\n\n\nI‚Äôm on my LAST two week P/F clerkship and literally have one week left. What the hell am I supposed to do?? I can‚Äôt very well crawl around clinic. They‚Äôre sympathetic enough and may let me avoid surgery but surely missing half the rotation is not acceptable.\n\nGenuinely looking for logistic suggestions (not medical ones). TIA for anyone with ideas!",

This program is my #1 choice right now because I want kids in residency and having family around would be super helpful. My concern with applying there is I don‚Äôt want co-residents viewing me as someone that got the spot because of being related to XYZ. I am a competitive applicant for this field with H/H- almost all clinicals, research, volunteering, USMD mid-tier school etc. I have no doubt I‚Äôll match into a program especially my home med school since they take any home student that‚Äôs an average applicant. My home program is ranked higher than this program. The program with family is ranked around 20-30s and it isn‚Äôt on either of the coasts. Family member is not involved in residency leadership or applicant selection. They are also slightly specialized so aren‚Äôt involved with the residency directly. I‚Äôm not denying having the same last name doesn‚Äôt have an impact on my application. I just don‚Äôt want to be viewed differently by co-residents. Any thoughts since nepotism is a hot topic on here rn? Again main reason I want to go here is because family support would making having kids easier",

However, I feel like I can't retain information well and tend to lose a lot of knowledge over summer break, or after we finish a block and that content no longer examined. It feels like my brain is leaking information. \n\nI'm scared that this will affect my clinical practice. For instance when I encounter a patient and think of a differential diagnosis, I sometimes miss out a few. I feel like I have difficulty retrieving information (as opposed to recognition like on a multiple choice question).\n\nIs this a common feeling? \n\nAny strategies to mitigate this?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/116to6h/adhd_is_a_real_disability_and_is_not_just_a/",
        "text": "I just wanted to put this out there because I was diagnosed with ADHD a short while back after struggling in medical school knowing something was wrong. I've always known something was going on but I usually just worked harder and got lucky on the intelligence side of things. However, I had more time for self care and college allowed much more time to regulate and relax my brain between classes and I didn't feel overworked. I never really took two classes back to back because I couldn't, but I thought that was normal. Anyways, I just got diagnosed with ADHD and started medicine finally. From my point of view I've never been lazy and no one would describe me as that besides maybe my parents LOL. I now realize from being on medicine that life was much harder for me than what a normal human feels. I got no sense of accomplishment for anything unless it was something super exciting, so I would always do stuff because logically I wanted a good life. However, I would say that y'all with ADHD who are labeled \"lazy\" should not really be labeled that when it takes much more effort and even can be mentally painful to do stuff for no dopamine. Just cause you can doesn't mean you should have to self-harm essentially to be equal with others. The other thing is the memory issues are absolutely unchangeable. Even if I sat down and started reading and exercise right beforehand I could read a sentence over and over and not get it. It doesn't have to do with how much your conscious mind wants to, it has to do with a primordial region of your brain. Of course your conscious mind can do stuff but it REQUIRES dopamine signaling to truly give full force attention and processing. Once I started medicine I felt completely normal. I don't ever want to say med school is close to easy now, but relatively speaking its like a cakewalk right now. I'm not saying that to compare or reference anyone else, I'm saying that to give you a reference to how much ADHD affected how difficult things were for me. I knew the memory issues were wrong because if I could stress myself out enough or get excited enough I had near instantaneous memory. I'm writing this because someone recently commented on a post I made saying \"lol all medical school students would be diagnosed with ADHD if the went\" which was just ignorant. I wanted to make a post with the truth so people can see what the research science, and personal experiences are like. There's a lot of misinformation about this with people invalidating ADHD as a real thing. ADHD being a real physical change in someone's brain sometimes alone. With some symptoms of ADHD literally being untreatable without medicine. No amount of effort or strategy helped me get my working memory consistently normal, and this is from someone who spent 6 hours a day exercising because I got a small boost of energy while I did it. In my case at least, it has absolutely nothing to do with \"laziness\" but you could totally see how in a case like mine why someone would just give up after trying so hard. Sure, they don't have to, but I want you to have an analogy for how fucking hard it can be and a realization some of the symptoms are literally only treated with medicine. I wanted to write this post to also just support anyone with a mental Illness or struggle in your life whether its officially diagnosed or you aren't sure what it is. People can say whatever they want, but care and science will be the winners of our generation. We need to stop misinformation and pseudoscience as much as we can or we will end up like the generation of people who put people in jail for smoking marijuana. I am sure there may be fake ADHD cases or people might use it as an excuse every now and then, but it's just cruel to lie and tell people their struggles aren't real. It's also just a scientifically proven fact with medicine curing 95% or patients first try. Ain't nobody looking \"woke\" or \"edgy\" trying to claim 50 years of research and modern medicine has made up a disease literally localised in the brain. I also forgot to say that ADHD is not a description for a personality type nor symptoms. ADHD is a very specific and proven neurophysiological disease that presents symptoms of decreased working memory, impulse control issues, and increase default mode network signaling due to those physiological changes. Just because you feel stressed and can't get off your phone or don't want to study doesn't mean you have ADHD. You very well might, and you can go get tested. I for one actually got a test done that is 100% specific for ADHD which used autonomic eye movements to measure ADHD levels. I wish everyone the best and anyone can PM me if they want to discuss this stuff.",

        "text": "Hey y'all, med student that just got diagnosed with ADHD after struggling in school the past 7 months. It would be so cheap to screen students for medical illness and mental health and it could even be practice for the MS2-4's. My illness could have been found first week. I know people are supposed to have their own health on their hands and their doctor is supposed to catch everything, but that's just not reality. I've met almost 20% of my class that figured out they had some sort of health issue when they started school. There should be some sort of physical before starting classes. They spent all this time lecturing us on professionalism, respect, and saving money skipping coffee when people could have got free screening. An ADHD screen would probably take 10-30 minutes and it could even be ran on an individual computer as a separate do at home thing. I just don't see why it wouldn't be worth it considering the difficulty of medical school. As I and my classmates have learned, medical school is so rigorous that there is absolutely no room for any sort of illness or disability. Everyone I know who had some sort of issue also struggled a LOT. We could argue they need to slow that shit down (it's literally fast for no reason then you take months off) but this would be easy to implement. I wouldn't have minded paying money for a good wide screen considering I'm paying so much money per year. Id just call it a good investment. Regardless of anything it just makes sense and to me it seems way more than worth it for the health of the school. I'm sure there could be a way to keep stuff private etc and it's just to screen. Everyone could see their results and then decide if they want to follow through with getting care. At least a few of these like ADHD could be completely anonymous and not even involve people. We wasted time with so much dragged out bullshit for like 20 hours, I'm sure they could fit in some ACTUAL wellness stuff. Maybe actually put room in check for mental illness instead of making mandatory wellness activities that just stress everyone out. Let me know what y'all think! I'm sure st the least they could start small and slowly add on if it's worth it. A take at home ADHD test would be a great start. Contrary to what people think plenty of med students are ADHD and struggling more than they need to. It.might not fail them but it's worth knowing about to have the option to treat.",
