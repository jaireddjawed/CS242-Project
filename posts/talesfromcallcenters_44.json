We had a meeting recently, you know the type: \"we're emplementing new exciting things to make work fun and better and blah blah blah but now you're required to write down five goals you want to achieve every so many months\".   \n\nNow in this line of work, I personally don't want to move up at this company, although I'd like to understand another departments functions as I get calls for their dept all the time. But that's just the one thing. Do you say you want to decrease your call time average by so many seconds?  What if you're already on par and don't want to or can't realistically lower your time? I don't really see having five goals at all times being realistic to begin with and like another superior in the company is just bored and wants something that looks good on paper documented. What kind of goals do you or would you have at your call center job? ",

        "text": "Hello all! I work for a verrrry large bank that does the financial backing for a big-box electronics store's credit cards. I take calls for new credit card applications and do identity verification and make sure there is no fraud going on, etc etc. This also comes with the territory of taking adverse action calls (people asking about decline letters, reporting fraud applications, asking why their account was shut down, and a ton of other things). \n\nWhich leads me to the Delusional Woman.\n\nA store employee calls in and tells me that the customer is asking why her credit limit is $3000 and not $5000. I was thinking she was maybe delinquent or something and it was reduced. Nope. Brand new account, less than a month old. \n\nNow, our policy is that we can do a credit line increase the first two days, otherwise it won't work until XX number of days. We cannot disclose the exact amount of time because of some federal regulation. \n\nSo I was reading through the account notes and she applied for a credit line increase when the account was about 3 weeks old, and it was declined because the account wasn't old enough. So she calls back the next day and they tried to do it again and got the same result. \n\nI got her on the line and told her that no, her increase had most definitely been declined and her credit limit is still at $3000. She swore up and down that they told her she was approved. \n\nThen she hits me with this line:\n\n\"You guys always say that I am being recorded and monitored, so I demand to listen to the recording!\" \n\nI politely and somewhat patiently explained that the recordings are for quality assurance and they are not to be released to anyone outside the bank. Then she got transferred to a supervisor because she still was demanding to listen to the recording. \n\n\n***********************\n\nNow one from today!\n\nA lady calls in about an internet application. (When they apply online, most of the time it will prompt to call in with a reference number to verify identity). She tells me that the application is for her husband, but he doesn't speak English very well. I said \n\"ok, let me get the reference number and I will get an interpreter when I am ready to speak with him\". So she tells me he speaks Serbian and asks if we have an interpreter for that, I tell her yes and she is quite shocked. \n\nI call our interpreting service and get a Serbian interpreter. I bring them on the line and ask to speak with the applicant. He sounds very far away so I request for them to turn off speaker (for security reasons, I cannot proceed with anything on speaker). After much confusion and yelling in Serbian from all 3 parties, finally the wife tells me that her husband is travelling in Serbia and she is trying to Skype him and put him on speaker so I can hear him. \n\nSo I just played dumb and asked to put them on hold while I contact a supervisor to see if that is okay - just to make it seem like I don't know they're committing fraud. Supervisor tells me the obvious to shut it down and don't prod for any info. So I tell them that we cannot process the application at this time, and he would need to call back himself. \n\nI kinda wish I had saved that reference number to see if he ever calls back.",

If they can't listen to the instructions we give them, they shouldn't be calling us.  If they're not able to maintain the basic attention level necessary to carry on a phone conversation without doing eleven other things simultaneously, they *shouldn't be calling us*.  They should be heavily medicated and strapped to a table.  \n\nParticularly since all my company does is service refrigerators. Anyone who can't hold a conversation with a repair person for two minutes, attention undivided, should have their organs harvested prematurely.\n\nWorse are the couples who have the wife and husband on the line simultaneously and can't - despite years of marriage - manage the base-line coordination to shut the fuck up while I give one or the other of them instructions.  This is doubly awful when there's a wretched, stinking little ankle-biter in the room, screeching about the Tonka truck they've somehow managed to get wedged into their nasal passage.  \n\nThe most terrible beast of all is the middle-aged woman who rings in from a town that hasn't seen a Presidential candidate since Barry Goldwater drove through, pissing and moaning about her spine pretzel-ization condition from ten feet away from the microphone while you're trying furiously to translate her rambling, incoherent story into something having to do with why her fridge is broken.\n\nI hope the high holy smites the engineer who invented that device with opera-singing testicle warts!\n\n/rant",

        "text": "I had a customer on Friday who may have pushed my limits of patience and integrity; a woman so overwhelmingly abrasive that it left me clawing on my desk in an attempt to resist losing my calm and my job. \n\nThis women is in debt for her mobile phone - very clearly she owes it. \n\nShe had rambled on about everything that failed to invoke my heart strings - of course she teaches at the University, helps the homeless, is very respectable, and has to inform everyone like a Vegan with a twitter account. \n\nShe had gone on for five whole minutes, I'll pinpoint each thing that was escalating my nerves - and my shift was going so well, and this month has been pretty good because it's Bonus payout this month and I'm looking to buy a new PC. \n\n\"You're threatening to make me bankrupt!\"\nYou cannot, and have never been able to, make someone do this in the UK unless you're a judge - when I had highlighted this to her she screamed at me and told me to \"not dare use that word as she has never been bankrupt in her life\" with a clear exhibit of her complete lack of knowledge on what that actually means. \n\n\"Listen here Boy!\". For the American redditors, this means something different - it's a degrading term to call any man and not a racial term like it is used in the South. She called me this far too many times, and I had told her to stop it multiple times. \"Mad'am I am warning you one more time and one more time only - you will not refer to me as boy and if it happens one more time I will disconnect this call and will process this encounter as a failure to arrange!\"\n\n\"You're not educated enough to tell me I owe anything!\" Well, apparently she teaches at a University despite her title being Ms; No Professor, not Doctor, not Reverend. Ms. I am doing a degree on the side because I prefer having the work experience then the education to move on, and I have a cushy job where I make far above minimum and have a bonus that's paying for my privately funded degree with enough on the side to have paid off my own debts in three months. \n\n\"You're nothing more than a common thug!\" She said unironically as she was screaming down the phone like a demonic entity. \n\nAnd last, but not least, the one that finally broke me.\n\n\"It's illegal to talk over the customer!\" Are. You. Fucking. Kidding. Me. You ignorant dried out old prune!\n\nShe hung up the phone when I refused to let her speak - she had her five minutes, fuck her. \n\nThe kicker? She put in a complaint - accusing me of swearing at her, threatening her with bailiffs (which are court officers and something we'd lose our license over for saying) and accused me of saying I'd make her bankrupt. She had escalated the complaint straight to our complaints team who marked it as a legal-level-threat which means an agent may have put the company in danger. The procedure for this is to have the manager of the department and my TL sit in with me in private along with the complaints officer to listen to the call - the reason for this is so they can suspend someone straight away without creating a scene or disruption. \n\nMy manager and TL know me well. My manager and I speak every day as his office is on the entrance to the department's office. They were sat there in disbelief; they knew I was angry about the call but they were hoping the call wouldn't be as bad as the customer had made it to be. \n\nWe went through it. They were all sat there in silence listening to this woman and noting everything down. The complaints officer sat back in absolute disbelief. \n\nAfter the call ended there was a very awkward silence which was broken with the complaints officer blurting out with \"I'll get this filed under the shredder cabinet - what a cunt\".\n\n\"Good lad, now get back to making me money\" was the response from my manager as made me sign the paperwork for the complaint with a big \"N/A\" over the actions section. \n",

        "text": "I had my monthly one to one meeting with my manager today. I've just swapped onto her team and she's fairly new to the business. A one to one basically covers where you are, if you're meeting targets, that kind of thing. I'm completely fine, meeting every metric. Before the meeting she gave me a sheet to fill in with four headings. \"What has gone well\", \"What has not gone well\", \"Is there anything that has affected your work\" and \"Is there any support I can give you\". This is where the problem starts.\n\nI put N/A for every single one of those. I genuinely couldn't give less of a fuck about my job. I go, I do it, and then as soon as it's home time I forget about the place. I have no desire to climb their corporate ladder, nor to do anything else beyond what I'm already doing. I'm doing fine, I've been doing fine for a while, I'm probably going to be doing fine next month.\n\nThis seemed to upset her. Apparently my one to one is about more than just the numbers, it's about personal development. This set off my bullshit detector. According to my manager it'd be good for me to write down anything that has gone well in the past month, at home or at work. She mentioned she knew I have a degree and that I'm going on a stag party this weekend. Quite honestly, I see no fucking reason to involve work in my life outside of that place. A huge part of me would like to tell her that work is simply a building I go to for eight hours a day and then every month beer tokens appear in my bank account. I don't think this would go down well.\n\nI'm now a bit stuck as to what I should do next month. I'm fairly certain she will persist in the misguided notion that my job actually matters to me. I mean, it's easy to get to, but that's about it. I'm considering playing her at her own game, and filling those boxes with management jargon and clichés, \"blue sky thinking\" and all that bollocks. Hopefully she won't realise I'm being sarcastic and lampooning her.",

        "text": "TL;DR post, you have been warned,\n\nI just started a job at an insurance company as a call center rep just about a month ago. The insurance is Medicare supplemental insurance - so the demographic of 98% of our customers is 65+, as those are who normally have Medicare. Overall? The job is fairly straight forward... Not too hard by way of call centers, but I've been struggling with one thing.\n\nMy AHT.\n\nMy job takes AHT into a huge consideration - possibly more than quality/defects, though at least equally. My job asks for the AHT of their CSRs to be 250 seconds or less, which equals just about 4 minutes. I sat down with my manager today because my AHT was a bit high - about 320ish if I remember right.\n\nWhen she asked me what she thought was happening to make my AHT so high, quite literally the only answer I could come up with was I was being too friendly/too helpful. I felt weird answering the question that way, but it was the honest truth. Even though our AHT is expected to be about 4 minutes, my manager admitted that our AHT per call should be closer to around 2-3 minutes, to allow for some wiggle room should you get a long, 10 minute call or something. She also admitted to me that a lot of people expressed concern over the low AHT, because it made them feel like they had to cut customers short and deliver at best sub-par customer service in order to get off the phone quick enough.\n\nWhat really works against the AHT is the fact that the company uses 12 different programs, the main 3 of which are old windows DOS keyboard-based applications from the dawning of the internet, and occasionally more if you include things like excel files.  To top it all off, as mentioned earlier, our customers are 65+ - many of them are a little slow at comprehending due to their age, whether it be because they're hard at hearing, or because they're just older and slower at registering new information. So sometimes you have to repeat yourself.\n\nI was sat a couple of times with a CSR who is known for being really efficient with her calls, and had great AHT - but what I notice is when it was mentioned as efficient, she just came off as short, not caring, and almost sounded, in her tone and manner of speaking, that her customer was an annoyance. Sure, she knew her stuff and was really good at navigating the systems and I'm sure that helped, but her call-handling ability bothered me. Did these elderly people not matter to her?\n\nI feel like, given the circumstances, AHT should be closer to 6-7 minutes as opposed to the aforementioned 4 (which again actually translates more to like 2-3 minutes). But the company is so ingrained in their ways I don't think it'll change. It really affects taking care of the customer, building rapport, and handling the call right the first go around.\n\nSorry guys, had to get this off my chest.",

I've unfortunately been stuck in dead in call center jobs for almost 15 years. I have the opportunity now to go back to school but I don't even know where to start. All I know is I don't want to do call center work anymore. I'm thinking I want to supplement my marketing degree with some sort of data analysis training but does anyone know the best way to go about this? Like what degree should I be looking at? Is there a shortcut in anyway other than getting a masters degree? Those are expensive too?! Any advise is appreciated. Thanks.",

I know (from this job) that there is a lot of people out there that just don't give two shits about the world around them. But really, it's a missing child. There is only so much they can do to help themselves out. I just wish i had the ability to get rid of the bulletin without them knowing so if a tornado is coming there direction they will never know until it's too late. \n\nWorking this job has made me hate the people that live in this world that much more. :-)",

You need to get with the program! Are you aware of the current year? This site looks like it was made on MS Dos\n\nCSA: What seems to be the problem?\n\n\nGM goes on a rant about how he linked his accounts, etc. Long story short, to do what he wanted to do, he needed to have multiple accounts with multiple sign-ins. GM did not like this. \n\nCSA: I'm sorry that this isn't acceptable to your standards, but I cannot give the CEOs number away. I will gladly document a complaint for you.\n\nGM: No, I don't want a complain. I want results, not excuses. I want this fixed, and I want it done. Your CEO will fix this shit for me or lose my business (he literally gets the service for free).\n\nCSA: I will gladly fill out a complaint for you since you are disatisfied with the service and our resolution team will look into a solution.\n\nGM: That isn't acceptable.\n\nCSA: I can gladly fill out a complaint for you that you do not find our resolution process acceptable. Can I get your account number so I can document this (No account or verification at this time) \n\nGM: I will not give you my account number. You honestly shouldn't be asking for that. This entire company is going to break one day from your policies.\n\nCSA: I'm sorry that you feel that way. If you can provide me with some method of pulling up your account, I will gladly document your concerns.\n\n*click*\n\nI've realized that if you constantly inform them that you will file out a complaint, and then offer to file a complaint to that complaint, that people will eventually just hang up. I used this about 7 times today and dropped my AHT by about 50 seconds. \n\nDoes anyone have any tips that will not get me points on customer service experience?  I really need ways to get these people off of my phone so I can do my job.",

Thank goodness it was a transfer from a supervisor who let me know this guy was super pissed he couldn't get into his account online to make a payment and said he got disconnected 4 times so my supervisor said she'd stay on the line to make sure that didn't happen again. No problem. \n\nSo he comes thru and rants for 7 solid minutes on why he's so upset and thinks my company doesn't know what they're doing and really wants to lose his business because he can't log himself online when he knows he's been entering everything correctly. Clearly not if I have to help you log in but whatever. \n\nOur verification for customers to login is to ask a pass or fail quiz of 3 multiple choice questions and if they fail answering those questions they have to give us a policy number. Pretty simple. \n\nNope he failed the quiz and when I asked for his policy number he started hysterically laughing asking if I was serious and it really sounds like I want to lose his business. He said he knows he's entering the right username and password and if I would just pay attention I can log him in. He asked me 3 times, \"tell me right now you no longer want my business\", HAHAHAHA tell me you want to lose my business right now because it sounds like none of you give a damn and are so incompetent you can't even log me in! In the most monotone voice I can, I tell him that we do care about his business but since he failed the quiz and can't give me a policy number I cannot log him in but I can help him make a payment over the phone instead and leave a message for his agent to assist in logging him in since agents are our last resource of verification to help customers login.\n\nHe acted as if that was the dumbest he's ever heard and says:\n\nSo let me get this straight you can get payment from me which has VERY delicate information but can't log me in? Do you guys ever do your job right? Oh this is rich and then my supervisor cuts him off and backs up what I just explained to him and also that he already verified his birthday and address to her and that's all the information we need to make payments with the customer.\n\nHe starts again in his rude tone: Soooo basically what you're saying is you can accept payment from me whenever you want but can't log me in? This is the most ridiculous customer service I've ever had.\n\nSupervisor: that's exactly what I'm saying. There's very different verification for customers who want to make a payment and customers who need to login. For payments we only need your birthday and address which you gave me and to login you needed to pass the quiz or provide a policy number which you couldn't provide so that's why I offered to accept payment.\n\nCustomer: That's bullshit honey,  corporate is gonna hear all about this and congratulations you just lost my business because you clearly don't give a fuck about me or my policies. \n\nSupervisor: I understand your frustration and explained our procedures and I offered assistance but I will have to disconnect the call for the type of language you are using. \n\nAnd she hung up:) I really hope we lost his business though..",

I've been working here for little over a year now and I have had my fair share of how shall we say interesting people but one call I had today gave me the chuckles\n\n\n\nCustomer calls in no screen pop but I greet her and ask her how I can help her today. C will be customer M will be me:\n\n\n\nC: I need to suspend my services for a few days  \n\nM: Unfortunately we do not have any way to suspend them for a few days we do offer a seasonal hold but you do have to have the services off for a 60 day time period or you pay full price for those days  \n\nC: That's fine I just need them off  \n\n*This struck me as odd I see people trying to put services on seasonal to get their bill caught up...so I just had to ask*  \n\nM: Do you mind if I ask why you want to suspend the services? Are you going away, are you worried about billing?  \n\nC: No its a long story but there is a woman living with my son and she's freeloading and I figure if I turn it off she will move on to some other man  \n\n*Que me giving that look wtf look to the computer screen*  \n\nM: If the account is in you or your sons name then you guys can just unhook the equipment, achieve the same goal  \n\nC: No she'll just call the cops. She always calls the cops. My son has bi-polar, Yes^has^bipolar, and she says he hits her.  \n\n*I'm just baffled at this point*  \n\nM: But if its in either your sons or your name its yours you do with it what you want  \n\nC: Well I'm just going to call the electric company see if they'll shut off the electricity to get her to leave. Thanks for the help though\n\n\n\nJust a funny call though pretty sure Mom did not like her son's girlfriend, free loader, or whatever you want to call her. I guess she figured if she got everything turned off that the woman would leave. I mentioned she could have her son unhook it and just remove it from the home, but she said he wouldn't do it. Turns out the account was in her sons name anyway and she couldn't do anything to it. Just a funny story. Lady was not overly mean or anything just the circumstances she was calling for was quite funny to me. \n",

She cuts me off during this and starts screaming. Loud. The audio was clipping and her screaming was barely coherent. She said she wants someone out within 12 hours. Which would put her at about 4 in the morning. A time that no tech is going to come out at. I tell her the soonest we have available which happens to be in approximately 5 days. She instantly flies off the handle saying that I don't understand what she's going through and that she's going to report me for inconveniencing her and not giving her what she wants. I instantly message my supervisor and tell him what happened and asked if we should still set up the service call for that day to which they responded with \"nope. I'm not setting it. Not with that kind of behaviour.\" Laughter ensued. I've mostly learned now not to take what customers say to heart, and I can honestly say I'm loving my job. ",

        "text": "Working in collections can be interesting at times. \n\nWe've just recently acquired a new client who has all their customer services based in South Africa and in Asia - their customer care team are absolutely terrible to the point where myself and a few of my colleagues have had to ban certain members of their team from calling our office due to their poor conduct and general wastage of our time. The client isn't especially happy at this, but we provide them £40,000 in collections a month, so they can sit on their thumb.\n\nSo terrible are our client's customer services that customers are now actively and intentionally letting their bills go to the debt recovery stage just so they can deal with someone in the UK. \n\nAs someone who deals with collections, there are certain cultural values in the UK that do not translate to these oversees care teams.\n\nHere's a few of the instances when I've sat back as a debt collector and questions the morality of the companies we deal with. \n\n#1: A male-Female Transgender woman opens the line with \"I'm Transgender, I hope this doesn't offend you\". I was taken back, I couldn't tell if it was someone trying to get past Data Protection by pretending to be female. They weren't. I told them it didn't bother me. They burst out crying because the oversees customer services refused to acknowledge their switch and were verbally abusive over the issue. \n\n2# A Gay couple who's application for joint status on an account was declined by a few Indian call handlers who hung up when finding out they were gay. \n\n3# A cancer patient who was forced to leave their home for a hospice for their last few months and couldn't carry across their broadband services was charged the full contract. We requested to write off the balance as it wouldn't make us feel especially great collecting on something which is pointless to collect on. The client's in house team were rude, unhelpful, and just ignored the fact that someone's last few months on Earth probably shouldn't involve a telecomms bill.\n\n#4 A British Muslim who had grown up In England hit out with \"These idiots are the reason my parents left India\" as he was annoyed at not being able to understand the stupidity of the client's customer services. \n\n#5 Conferenced in to a conversation between customer services, the customer, and customer services assuring the customer that we would reconnect their services and are responsible for this. Customer knew it was a lie, and I wasn't prepared to play with it. \"I can't do that, and you know our arrangement for collections doesn't include that service? I suggest you help the customer before calling us again.\" *Click*\n\n#6 Cold transfer to our office as customer service's own complaints team were all busy (wonder why?) and customer was assured we were the complaint team. Oh boy, we raised a complaint and sent the entire debt back to the client as 'unjustifiable'. \n\n#7 Well Educated, Middle-Class female Doctor who was called a 'stupid woman' by a Middle-Eastern member of one of our less than reputable telecoms provider clients; we sent the debt back as a 'justified non payment' and after having to take down 20 minutes of every stupid thing our client had done to provoke non payment we sent a very well worded email to our corporate contact.\n\n#8 Just before removing this especially parasitic client in loans (even we didn't want to deal with their poor practices, and loans are usually high revenue for us) we had someone call in who was told to take out another loan to pay their existing loan, and had no explanation of the FCAs guidelines of payment arrangements, we gave her the Ombudsman complaints number and closed down the customer's account and also sent back a few thousand accounts as 'Poor practice/too high legal risk' within a couple of weeks.",

(WTF!?)\n\nI tried to make her see reason by saying \"what's going to cost you more in the long run? one ambulance ride or losing your vision forever?\" but she said she had already called a friend to give her a ride to the hospital and my manager said given the circumstances we weren't going to call an ambulance for her without her consenting to one. \n\nUGH... I'm already dissatisfied with all the other immoral shit that the telecommunications companies do and now this?  \n\nI just want to say thank you to all the call center workers out there who do work in 911 call centres. don't know how you do it. hopefully I handled this call OK.

        "text": "Hi! A colleague and I, have worked collectively in the industry for over 40 years. We both started at the bottom and worked our ways through the ranks. During that time, between the two of us, we’ve seen and heard everything, from the bizarre to the downright freaky. My personal favorite is the day our call center was shut down for an entire afternoon because of a bomb hoax. Most people enjoyed the prolonged smoke break, while the non-smokers shivered in the cold waiting for the police to clear the building. It's amazing how many people wanted to run back into the building to get their wallets and purses!\n\nWe’ve often thought that those stories would be good reading value for anyone in the industry, and even more so for those outside it. Some stories would make you laugh hysterically, others could make you weep. They would make you realize that your not alone, and that these experiences are common no matter whether you are in a call center in Melbourne or Manila, regardless of industry.\n\nSo we’re putting together “Tales from the Call Center Industry”, an e-book compilation of stories across a range of topics, that will shed some light into a world that most people only experience as a customer on the other end of a (probably) frustrating call.\n\nTaking a look through this subreddit, I see some AMAZING stories here - and we'd love you to consider formally submitting them for the e-book.\n\nIf you're interested in sharing your story/stories, or you would like to know more about who we are, please do visit our FB page (http://www.facebook.com/TalesFromTheCallCenterIndustry/). You can pick up a copy of our content submission primer from there, which will let you know more about how to submit and the content guidelines. \n\nStories can be anonymous! But take a read on the content primer and make your decision as to whether to be identified or not afterwards.\n\n",

Arms were heavy. I took a break and then lunch happened. I went to lunch and couldn't eat anything. I drank a gatorade and a water followed by a pack of bayer.\n\nIt also didn't help I had two monsters before hitting the floor so my heart rate was already up. \n\nI debated on leaving and just bitching out for being \"sick\", but something told me to stick it out and if I really needed to leave then I would just tell the trainer and go.\n\nI expressed to the trainer my feelings and he paired me up with someone more experienced. Everything started feeling better and I made it through. I started to calm down, and my stomach kept going up and down. I finally made it through.\n\nI then eventually stayed an extra two hours after training was finished to shadow people. \n\nDo you eventually get used to all that? Give it to me straight.\n",

He ended up selling her the highest service package.  After which, he went back to her house a couple hours later and they had 'sexual relations'.  I mean, who even calls it that?\n\nSo, months later in Sept 2015 she calls in complaining of being drunk when signing the contract but now is sober and signing the contract was unjust and wants to launch a complaint about the salesperson and wants to cancel her contract.\n\nuh huh.\n\nedit to finish story - not sure why it didn't save properly: so yesterday, she called back as she got another bill and was a mess crying about the ordeal.  Now, I'm not going to speculate why yesterday caused another call after her complaint from September... but why the fuck did they not cancel her account when she complained?  why the fuck did she keep paying the bills until yesterday?  It's not rocket science, customer claims they were drunk when signing a contract so it's a quick '56' to just cancel the shit and move on.  But no, the escalated agent taking care of this did nothing besides making a note in the account that there was no way to determine if the salesperson and the customer had done anything and there is no way to determine if she was indeed drunk when signing.  uh huh.  seriously?\n\npainfully enough, this is the reality i work in.\n\nfuck me.  gee, those stats are so important... don't wanna process that cancellation otherwise you are doing a shit job.  yup, wonderful judgement once again on behalf of 'customer service'.",

        "text": "Today I hanged up on an abusive customer. At the moment, I felt like it'd be more satisfying if we had actual phones at work so that I could actually hang up instead of pressing a button forcefully like a dork. But I digress. \n\nHowever, what really disheartens (even more) about this job is what happened afterwards.\n\nI'm going to tell you the full story, since I did hang up on him in a blaze of glory.\n\n\nIt started like this:\n\nCustomer called to dispute his bill. He said that the previous agent had told him he would be charged $80+ after tax, whereas on his bill he was charged $91 and change. Turned out there was some mixed-up with the prorata and we overcharged him $3.39 before tax. No biggies, let me adjust this for you, sir.\n\n&gt; Asshole: No I don't want you to adjust anything. I want to speak with your manager.\n\nOf course you do.\n\n&gt; Me: I understand your frustration, sir. But let me assure you, it takes only about 2 minutes for me to apply the adjustment.\n\n&gt; Asshole: Don't give me this empathy bullshit. I don't want you to adjust anything. I want you to get me your manager.\n\n&gt; Me: I'm just trying my best to help you here, sir. I can certainly approach my manager for you. However, I do ask you to kindly keep your language professional.\n\n&gt; Asshole: I don't need you to talk to your manager for me! I want to speak with your manager myself!\n\n&gt; Me: I know what you mean, but I still need to let them know you'd like to speak with them, no? \n\n&gt; *Silence.* \n\n&gt; Me: Please stay on hold. I'll be back in a few minutes.\n\nNow, our call center is an outsourced party doing customer service for a wireless provider, and it's run by a bunch of cheap bastards. Since earlier this month, our hours have been cut and half of the supervisors (floor supports that can take supervisor calls - team managers only handle the administrative part of things) have been put back on calls because the company is too cheap to pay them an extra dollar per hour. So naturally, there was only one person who could take supervisor calls at that moment. And he was furiously typing on his computer when I went to him.\n\n&gt; Me: There's this guy who wants to speak with a manager over 3 dollars. Could you take the call?\n\n&gt; FS: No I can't. I have work to do here and 2 other agents asking for sup calls. You'll have to offer a callback within 24 hours.\n\nSo I went back to the asshole to deliver the bad news.\n\n&gt; Asshole: This is bullshit. I asked for a manager as your customer, and I should be able to speak to one now!\n\n&gt; Me: Again, I have to ask you to please keep your language professional. On top of that, my manager cannot physically come to you right now because he has two other calls to take and that's why we offer you a callback within 24 hours.\n\n&gt; Asshole: Then I'm gonna wait here until I speak with him.\n\n&gt; Me: Okay no problem. I will let him know and be back in a couple minutes.\n\nSo I went to the aforementioned floor support, who was just grabbing his headset to take the first live sup call. Of course, he couldn't take 2 calls at once. So I went to my actual team manager, only to be told that she didn't have the authorization to take live sup calls and that I would have to push for a callback.\n\nI said no worries, he's probably gonna swear a third time and then I can hang up on him.\n\n&gt; Asshole: I don't care. You can put me back on hold and I'm gonna wait.\n\n&gt; Me: Sir, let me tell you something. First of all, the issue you are calling about is the $3.39 prorata that you are charged by error. And we already offer you 2 solutions: let me adjust the amount for you and that's it that's all, or you could speak with my manager when he calls you back within 24 hours. Of course, it's your prorogative to stay on hold and wait. And since my manager has 2 calls to take, it'll be at least half an hour before he can come to you. Yes you can wait here, all day if you want, but then it wouldn't be fair to other customers who are also waiting in the queue for me to help. \n\nOf course my primary concern is not other customers waiting, but my hold time, but he deserved to be guilt-tripped.\n\n&gt; Asshole: This is unacceptable! I am a customer and you're supposed to give me what I ask!\n\n&gt; Me: And this is exactly what I'm doing. You want to speak with my manager. And I did follow the procedure to inform him, but it's just physically impossible for him to come to you right this moment. The callback is really your best option now.\n\n&gt; Asshole: Well then I'm gonna take your name and your employee ID and I'm gonna go to your head office. I'm gonna make you lose your job!\n\n&gt; Me: No, that's not happening. \n\n&gt; Asshole: What did you say?!\n\n&gt; Me: I cannot give you my employee ID because it's for internal use only. You can go ahead with the head office, and I'll be fine because I did follow the proper procedure.\n\nI wasn't trying the be smart with him by telling him I couldn't give him my employee ID. I was told in my first day of training to never give customer my last name, my employee ID or our location. So again, I was just following what I was told.\n\n&gt; Asshole: Then tell me what call center you're in and I'm gonna come sort this out with you - \n\n&gt; Me: Very good. Now I'll have to terminate the call because you just made a personal threat against me. Thank you for calling. Have a great day. *boop*\n\nWhen I hanged up, he was still talking.\n\nI've always been meticulous with my notes since it not only protects the customers, but it also protects me. Naturally, I wrote down a brief but concise summary of what has transpired in the call, including the 2 warnings for swearing, the fact that I offered adjustment and callback multiple times, and the threat he made against me.\n\nI went back to his account 2 hours later to see if he has made a complaint against me. Of course he did. And what did the next agent do? Sure, she didn't report me, but she somehow got her manager to give the motherfucker $30 goodwill credit.\n\n**Goodwill.**\n\nWhen we reward people for being assholes, we just make our lives an even bigger and shittier living hell.",

This is a throwaway because it'd be obvious on my main.\n\nSo, I work for an appliance delivery service, associated with a major appliance company in the US. We take calls for two main accounts handled all across the U.S. and Canada. The job is crap, the pay is crap. Every chance I had before to move up, when putting in extra hours to contribute to the role I wanted to work into, has been denied ruthlessly. Even going so far as to give the open position to a brand new trainee from highschool than me.\n\nI've given up trying to be the good worker and do my job, now I've just been here for the community of my coworkers, essentially my only friends in this godsforsaken little shithole of a city.\n\nI'm turning 22 next week we moved out here a few years back, this has been the longest lasting job that I've had yet. But I'm biting at the bit to get fired. Still being with my parents they're supposed to take part of my pay per week to assist with the accomodations and what not. I get that, but for the last year that I've been working here they've taken everything I've saved up, everything I've made. I'm dry of funds and cant get out now. And i don't know where else to turn.\n\nI'm not 'allowed' to quit. It'd be a bitchfight from here to hell and back again if I did. My only other option is being homeless, but at this point anything is better than getting yelled at 10 hours a day, 50 hours a week. I can't take it any more.\n\nActually running over my lunch time now just to write this and blaze out some frustration. I've got no idea what to do, where to go, how to handle this. I'd like to have another job lined up before I left, but at this point there's no reason for me to. Parents will still be taking all my money never the less. Every communication I've had to try and stop that has been met with 'you're paying us back first' I'm not even in fucking college god dammit, I don't have to pay back for shit. I just need to get the fuck out of this shithole.\n\nFuck.\n\n/endrant",

I work for a company who provides a few systems to a few hundred banks across the U.S. Banks are clueless on how the systems work, and constantly give misinformation and often advertise it as a program that can do A LOT of things that it can't. Apparently my company pays banks to advertise it, and they do a horrible job, but ultimately a department of 60 people is left to clean up the mess. 30 in the day shift, 30 at night. \n\nSo, let's begin on what happened today.\n\nNorma called me today, year of birth was 1970, and she was having trouble resetting her password. Worst case scenerio, I would have to send out the password because she doesn't have an updated browser. WELLL\n\nNorma: Hey, this dumb system is saying that my password is incorrect\nMe: Oh, that happens all the time (not) sometimes we do have to reset those. Can you hit the forgot password link? I'll make sure it goes through.\n\nThat should have been the end of it - but there is more!\nI began hearing her mumble to someone who began arguing with her. A mild annoyance, but she told them to leave after a 20 second exchange. I thought this was to my advantage.\n\nNorma: Ok, Mister KNOWWWWW IT ALLLLLLL has left now. lets' get to this. So, tell me what to do\n\nMe: Enter your user name and hit the \"Can't remember your password?\" link. \nNorma: Where do I enter it?\nMe: Are you on (explain screen)\nNorma: Yes\nMe: Do you see the bar that says, \"User name?\"\nNorma: Yes\nMe: Ok, type your name there.\n\nNorma goes silent for a bit and responds that It's not working. Apparently nothing is typing out and I hear her slap her keyboard a few times.\n\nMe: Is your keyboard plugged in? Have you been experiencing any issues with your computer?\n\nNorma: No, my keyboard should work fine. Dummy over here was just on it. \n\nMe: Ok, refresh the screen by pressing F5.\n\nThis exchange took about 10 minutes before I realized that she wasn't clicking on the damned \"User name box\" Let's save you all some time here .  .  \n\nI explained that she needed to click on the user name box to type in the name, then realized she didn't know how to use a mouse. Throughout the whole exchange she kept asking \"Which mouse button do I click with?\" and \"Where is the enter button on - oh I remember.\"\n\nDumb things like that - so you see where this is going.\n\nMe: Ok, so click within the user name box.\nNorma: OK\nMe: Alright, hit the forgot password link.\nNorma: It says back, forward, reload, what do I do? \nMe: Use the left click button, Norma.\nNorma: I don't see a left click button. \nI hear her fumble with the mouse\nme: The button on the left that you used to click the \"User Name\" box.\nNorma \"Ok, I clicked it.\"\n\nI hear her fumble around for 30 seconds and she finally says \"The new password isn't working\"\n\nMe: The one sent to your email?\nHer: What? I thought I could just type in a new password.\nMe: Unfortunately we need to get into your email. What is your email address?\nHer: Let me go and find it\n\nKEEP IN MIND, THIS WOMAN IS IN HER LATE 40S\n\n2-3 minutes later, right after calling out the hang-up script\n\nNorma: I'm here!\n\nFast forward 40-50 minutes trying to explain how to sign into her email, how to check her email, how to copy and paste the password to someone who apparently didn't know how to use a mouse. At this point, I am ready to scream. \n\nMe:Ok, let's try to paste the new password into the \"password field\"\n\nShe apparently thought by \"Password field\" I meant the \"User Name\" from earlier. I had to explain this, and also why this process is so difficult.\n\nThen I hear the dreaded words, \"YOUR ACCOUNT HAS BEEN LOCKED, PLEASE CALL CUSTOMER CARE AT 800-\"\n\nBegin extra verification procedures that takes FOREVER because she doesn't know her own phone number, her bank account number, any of her TEN security questions - and right as I was about to give up and tell her that she is going to have to find another service, she decides to call her bank for her account number.  Good news! 15 minute wait time!\n\nI have to wait for her to fumble around with the banker. I put her on hold and go take a shit - come back and she is still on the phone with bank lady, who was about to transfer her to another department because the lady couldn't give out account numbers, and apparently couldn't tell her that before verifying. \n\nMore waiting. More waiting. . . More waiting.\n\nI unlock the account sometime after dark. This is hour 3 of Norma. The account is unlocked, and I now have her understanding the basics of typing, using a mouse, browser navigation, google, etc. I literally taught someone how to use a computer, but now it's time for the final exam, putting all of this use to knowledge.\n\nCan you find your email website on your own?\n\nFAIL\n\nCan you navigate the website and find your spam folder? \n\nFAIL\n\nCan you find where the email says, \"Your temporary Password is:XXX\" \n\nFAIL\n\nCan you copy this?\n\nFAIL\n\nCan you find your way back to our website?\n\nFAIL\n\nCan you at least paste the password\n\nFAIL\n\n\nAnd. . . we finally got it reset, nearly 2 hours my shift was over. I need a drink.\n\n\nMy supervisor was nowhere to be found during this until I was about to leave. They didn't even know when my shift ended, because they are simply never around. They saw my AHT and said I was going to be put under some performance review shit. I hope they fire me.",

        "text": "So, I'm putting in my resignation soon and want to tell off at least one customer before I do. Do you guys have anything you want to say vicariously? I have a couple ready to go, like If I get someone yelling from the start, I'll ask if they thought throwing a tantrum would get them good results, that kinda stuff. I promise I'll report back for the justice porn. :)\n\nEdit: ready, not test. Curse you, auto-correct!\n\nUPDATE: I actually got a couple zingers in before leaving and I handed out $50 \"nice customer discounts\" about 4 times. \n\nOne old guy was calling in the 2nd time that day with a snowy screen. After 10 minutes of trying to get him to change the input on his TV, I gave up and offered him a service call for (effectively) $10. He, of course, doesn't think he should pay anything because it's our equipment. \"Sir, this definitely is not our equipment. It's just that the TV is on the wrong input...and the fact that we got it working 20 minutes ago means that this is user error.\" Surprisingly, he just said OK and we moved on. Apparently I've been going about this wrong all along.\n\nAnother guy thought we should give him the introductory rates for customers and I advised him that \"if we offered those prices permanently then we wouldn't stay in business...or at least the CEO wouldn't get a gold-plated Jacuzzi but either way I can't offer that price.\"  He said he would go to our competitor and I wished him on his way.\n\nMy swan song was appropriately epic, IMO. Bitchy lady (BL) calls in claiming that she was told the service call was 8-12, but it's currently set for 12-4 today. Cue the yammering about how the tech will have to babysit her baby if he wakes it up, are we going to compensate her for the inconvenience, she's wasted her time calling us already, etc.. \n\nMe: \"And you thought that yelling at the person helping you would improve your results?\"\n\nBL: \"Well, you're the 5th person I've talked to so yes, I'm yelling!\"\n\nI tell her all I can do is submit a note to the office to have them try to squeeze her in and she tells me they already did that, we're just going to waste more of her time going in circles, we're all idiots, and so on. \n\nBL: \"So what are you going to do about this?\"\n\nMe: \"Not encourage self-entitlement.\" Then I hung up on her. It was good. ",

I think it is a combination of both.\n\nI am in a decent position and I am trying hard to stay positive by reminding myself it will be ok.

        "text": "So I haven't worked in any job before this sorta-call-centre job. Taking calls is now my job position since I've recently been called trained, but email and letter correspondence makes up the majority of contact we have with our customers. I work for a train operating company in the UK.\n\nSo, this woman calls through, and she feels that we owe her some money. Fair enough, our company is pretty generous as far as refunds and compensation goes, so it's quite possible that we do (according to our policy). She mentions that she attempted to make a payment, but it didn't go through properly, money was taken out, and she didn't get a booking reference from it. She has been ringfenced. For those who may not know; Ringfencing is where money from a transaction has been removed from the customer's account, but has not been received by us because the bank has started the process of transferring funds, but not finished, for either good reason or bad. We can't see the money, and it looks like the money has been taken from the customer - so naturally, it's always *our* fault.\n\nAnyway, *Pax* is the customer, short for *Passenger*, *TOC* is the Train Operating Company I work for, and *Me* is *Me*. Brits, please read Pax in a Northern accent.\n\n-----\n\nMe: [Introduction]\n\nPax: So, I explained to [advisor redacted, let's call them Frank] Frank my situation, I want to be put through to them.\n\nMe: Frank isn't in today, I'm more than happy to help you with your situation.\n\nPax: *grumbles* Well, I want *hoping* I'd be able to talk to Frank BUT I GUESS I WON'T WILL I?\n\nMe: Unfortunately, no.\n\nPax: Well, ANYWAY... -explains the situation-\n\nMe: Right, it sounds to me that something called 'ringfencing' has occured, what this mea-\n\nPax: Well what the *fuck* is that?\n\nMe: (Normally I allow some level of swearing before disconnecting) Well, what this means is (explains as above).\n\nPax: Well how does that help me? I'm sorry, but this is absolutely disgusting behaviour from TOC (Northerners love to use the work 'disgusting' when they don't get their way, I've discovered) and I want to speak to Frank immediately.\n\nMe: Frank isn't in today, he won't be able to take your call, as much as I'm sure he'd love to help.\n\nPax: WELL GO AND GET HIM THEN, HE KNOWS MY SITUATION!\n\n-----\n\nWhat? Go and get someone from their day off? Seriously?\n\n-----\n\nMe: I also know your situation, and I'd like-\n\nPax: I'M SICK OF BEING BOUNCED AROUND BETWEEN MANAGERS AND CALL IDIOTS WHO WON'T GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK AND-\n\n-----\nAt this point I've stopped listening, muted myself, and asked my manager, who's sat right next to me, to triple check that their payment didn't come through, he comes back (she's still yelling nonsense) and it still hasn't. Turns out she has contacted us before on several occasions about this, so we know exactly who she is - she doesn't know that we know who she is because I haven't taken any details or a case reference, and this pisses her off later.\n\n-----\n\nPax: -ND IT'D BE NICE FOR SOMEONE TO FIX THE PROBLEM!\n\nMe: I'm trying to fix the problem, have you contacted your bank?\n\n-----\n\nBank is the first point of call in this situation, we can't do anything about ringfencing.\n\n-----\n\nPax: Well no, of course I haven't, it's not THEIR fault it's YOUR fault.\n\nMe: The bank handles the transaction and we haven't received the funds, there's nothing we can do, and we can't contact the bank on you-\n\nPax: WELL THEN WHAT'S THE FUCKING POINT IN YOU IDIOTS? THAT'S IT, I'M CALLING THROUGH AGAIN AND I DEMAND TO BE PUT THROUGH TO A DIFFERENT ADVISOR NEXT TIME!\n\n-----\n\nSo she hangs up, I message the other advisors in case she comes through again to one of them, and they'll know what to do. I'm discussing the case with my managers, and keeping an eye on my turret. See, I sorta love discretely winding up customers when they're being complete knob-jockeys. There are no calls in the queue right now. There's a call in the queue right now. And I'm going to take it. Cue button press.\n\nIt's her, and she's livid.\n\n-----\n\nPax: Hi, I was just speaking to one of your other advisors (she never gets my name even though I say it in both of my introductions, she also didn't recognise my voice), and I want to make a staff complaint because the guy was a complete idiot and wouldn't help me. He had absolutely NO idea what I was calling about, and I don't understand HOW he could because he doesn't know my name, I didn't give him any numbers or ANYTHING!?\n\nMe: Well, typically when customers have called in several times about an issue, we learn about the customer's case and we're able to determine who they are before we officially pull up some contact details, that's how our advisor will have known who you are before taking your details.\n\nPax: Oh, well, I suppose that makes sense then.\n\n-----\n\nShe has no idea it's me.\n\n-----\n\nMe: So, before we get to your staff complaint about the previous advisor, I think I should make you aware that you're speaking to the previous advisor. \n\n-----\n\nShe completely lost her shit. I can't understand what she's saying because the distortion over the line because of how loud she's shouting is making her words inaudible. I'm trying not to laugh so hard, my manager can hear her from a desk away and he's pissing himself laughing.\n\n----\n\nPax: -O-ONE'S DOING ANYTHING TO FIX THE FUCKING PROBLEM!\n\nMe: There's no need to get angry (lol, knew this would rile her so why not), I'm trying to resolve the problem and you keep-\n\nPax: YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO FIX ANYTHING YOU FUCKING CUNT. AT THIS POINT I JUST THINK YOU'RE FUCKING AROUND AND-\n\n-----\n\nTo be fair, I was.\n\n-----\n\nPax: -THAT TOC IS TRYING TO STEAL MONEY FROM THEIR CUSTOMERS! GIVE ME YOUR FULL NAME IMMEDIATELY AND PUT ME THROUGH TO A MANAGER!\n\nMe: I don't have to give you my name.\n\nPax: It is my RIGHT as a consumer to ask for your name!\n\nMe: Yes, it is your right to ask for my name, and it's also my right not to give it.\n\nPax: THAT'S ABSOLUTELY FUCKING RIDICULOUS! I WANT TO KNOW YOUR NAME AND YOU HAVE TO GIVE IT.\n\nMe: No, I don't.\n\nPax: THAT IS AN ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING POLICY.\n\nMe: I'm sorry you feel that way.\n\nPax: YOU'RE FUCKING SORRY!? WELL WHAT FUCKING GOOD IS THAT GOING TO DO-\n\nMe: If you continue to use that language, I will have to terminate this call.\n\nPax: -AND I'LL NEVER USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN BECAUSE YOU'RE FUCKING DISGUSTING!\n\nMe: (I've stopped listening properly at this point) Thank you for the kind words, I am now terminating this call.\n\nPax: -UCK YOURSELF YOU UGLY LITTLE BAST-\n\n-----\n\nThe managers listened to my call afterwards and were completely on my side, and got some laughs out of it too. I don't know about you guys, but I find it invigorating when customers go ape over really stupid things. I love it, since it gives me the opportunity to wind them up over something that even they know is either not our fault, or entirely their fault. I love this job.\n\nTl;Dr - Customer called in, already angry, can't speak to the guy they last spoke to, I explain ringfencing, she doesn't get it, gets really angry, wants to speak to someone else so hangs up, calls through, out of 30+ advisors she gets through to me again, loses her shit, swears constantly, I rile her up a bit, she calls me an ugly little bastard and I hang up.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/47hnrt/the_joys_of_hiring_call_center_employees/",
        "text": "So as I said in a [previous story](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/4240ox/how_not_to_send_an_email/), I was involved in a hiring blitz.  Trying to get 50 decent t/s reps hired and trained in a month.  Had 3 different temp agencies bring us people as well as direct hires coming in.  At one point I was doing 20-30 interviews a day, there wasn't the time to review the resumes too much beforehand, and we had to rely on the temp agencies to do a lot of the weeding out for us.  So we had some winners.  Here's a few examples:\n\nThe call center was one of the endcaps of a mall, and as such had entrances on both sides.  The offices were actually on the second floor of the building, there was a retail store underneath it.  The mall-side door had a card system to prevent the general public from entering.  Unfortunately, the only elevator was on the mall side of the building, there was an escalator heading up from the parking lot side.  One of the temp agencies had an interviewee in a wheelchair come in, we had advised her to use the intercom on the mall door and we'd buzz her in.  Well she managed to ride up the escalator backwards instead.  Than her first statement during the interview was 'well once i'm hired here you'll need to get an elevator installed in the front, it's demeaning to have to come in the back door' (which most people did at least once a day, mall had a good food court).  Whatever.  Totally unqualified for the position, if she wasn't handicapped I wouldn't have thought twice about filing it in the 'no' column. Went to our HR person (who was a lady in a wheelchair incidentally) and told her what happened.  She advised that's a lawsuit waiting to happen, and if I wouldn't hire them without the handicap there's no reason to simply because of it.  I told the agency worker this was a no go, a week later she let me know that this girl's lawyer was involved and she was trying to sue the agency for discrimination.  Told the rep from the agency better them than me.\n\nThere were a few rules we'd provided to the agencies ahead of time.  One of the biggest was 'no tie, no interview'.  As I explained to one of the agency reps one night when we were out having drinks (she let me join her bowling league at one point), it wasn't really that I cared that they wore a tie, but that they demonstrated understanding the concept of professionalism in a corporate workplace.  More than once we'd tell the agency rep 'have them go change into appropriate attire and come back later'.  Well this one kid comes in, thugged out.  Sideways hat, drooped jeans, t-shirt, fubu jacket, hightops, big chains, gold grills, the whole nine yards.  Now before we go too much farther I'll explain that at this point I'm rocking a bald head, goatee, couple of earrings, possibly a visible tattoo, but I always project a professional demeanor.  Well this kid struts in and tells the receptionist 'sup ho, i'm here to get me a job'.  I'm sitting with the temp agency rep, and she spit out her coffee when she heard that.  Needless to say she told the kid we wouldn't be able to interview him the way he was dressed, and obviously not the way he spoke to the receptionist.  Well he flies off the handle, starts yelling at her, so I intercede (it is in my lobby after all), he starts in on me about being racist.  I said 'how am I racist?'  His response was 'you won't interview me cuz I'm black!'.  My response was 'No, I won't interview you because you're an idiot.  Get the fuck out of here before I call the cops'.  \n\nSince it's a call center position, and especially a technical support position, I needed to ensure that everybody could clearly speak English.  And since we were in Miami, that was a valid question.  So we had a script that we would have everybody read.  Couple of points we always looked for, 'axe' instead of ask, 'sheck' instead of check, 'jello' instead of yellow.  And of course proper verbiage.  Amazed me how many people either couldn't read out loud or were unintelligible.  That test got me cussed out, called racist because 'why should I read this shit to you?  You trying to weed out the ignorant n-rs?', one hispanic lady broke down in tears because she had problems reading in English (we actually hired her in an accounting job, far as I know she was still there when the company went out of business a couple weeks ago).  \n\nAnd then there's the interesting ones.  People that don't speak English, people that straight up tell you they don't want the job but have to come to the interviews so they can still get unemployment, the woman that demonstrated that she wasn't wearing anything under her dress and would 'do anything to work here' (I was glad I was videotaping that one, HR said we could have been royally hosed since we didn't hire her), the overconfident kid with his 'ok i want to work here, you want me to work here, let's just skip all this and sign the paperwork' (who I laughed at), and on and on.  \n\nBut the ones that stick in my head the most are the ones that made it through the process and crashed and burned.  There was the stripper that the CCM hired as a CS rep.  Exhibitionist from hell.  Had her boobs out like half the time I was training her.  Liked to walk by the CCM's office and flip her skirt up.  And I got told to 'turn a blind eye' even when one of the other reps filed an HR complaint after the chick started giving him a lap dance while he was on a call.  When I left that place she was an assistant department head.  \n\nOr the kid that literally 10 minutes after getting the 'appropriate internet usage' spiel during the first day of training gets seen by the CEO surfing porn on a company PC.  His excuse 'I was checking to see what the firewall would let me get to'.  It let him get to unemployment.\n\nOr the rep that took pictures of himself in front of the company's server room and posted them on his resale site (which was a direct competitor for us).  \n\nOr the girl that stole a customer's credit card information and bought a living room set for herself.  Sent it to her house to her attention.  Than said 'oh I thought I was using MY credit card, not the customer's card'.  Still don't know how she got the customer's card authorized for $3700, but whatever.  First time I had to call the cops and have somebody removed from the office. \n\nOr the rep that got caught stealing the taillights off of people's cars in the parking lot.  Incidentally he was stealing the lights off my truck when he got caught (and they got broken when he got busted).  Bastard, those light assemblies cost me $500 to replace.\n\nOr the woman that didn't like the fact that we had a policy stating no religious paraphenelia on your desk.  I walk in one day to find what looks like a shrine on her desk.  She's got a couple of crosses, a rosary, a picture of jesus, a little incense burner, and I don't know what all.  Pitched a fit when the office manager told her that stuff's not appropriate at the office, and take it down.  She started yelling at the office manager because we accommodated a muslim employee's daily prayers (set aside an unused office to let him take 10 minutes to do his prayers) but we wouldn't let her put this stuff up.  When I pointed out that he didn't have anything on his desk, and in fact she took more smoke breaks than he did prayer breaks, her response was \"It's discrimination I tell you!  And racism, cuz i'm black and not brown\" (yes that got said a LOT in that office).  She wasn't paying attention to the fact that she was still a temp.  She was not welcomed back.\n\nWorst one tho was a rep we'll call Bob (although that wasn't his name), early 50's, been in the industry for a while, knew his stuff.  Was looking for a position with steady hours cuz he took care of his mom during the day.  Since we were open 9-5 M-F that fit him perfectly.  Perfect fit, temp agency cleared his background, brought him in.  Right at 30 days in, he comes to me and tells me that he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, and that he's going to need to take some time off.  Since he's still a temp (we kept people as temps for 90 days before directly hiring) I told him to let the agency know, and cleared it with my boss to keep him as a temp as part time.  We didn't care, we weren't paying benefits anyway, so the less hours he worked the less we were paying the agency, and when he was there he was good.  Well this went on for 5 or 6 weeks, he was usually coming in one day a week (basically to get his timesheet signed).  Well I get my monthly report of hours, and notice that this fool has been submitting 40 hours a week every week.  I keep a copy of all the timesheets that I sign, so I look, and they should have been 8, 16, 8, and 8 hours for this period, or 40 hours total, not 160.  So I call the temp agency, who pitches a fit.  Terminates his employ, calls the cops to have him arrested.  Destroyed my faith in humanity that day.\n\n\ntl;dr - when you call for cattle, don't be surprised when you get them.",

These assignments were such strange, obscure situations I'd never heard of and yet it's like the questions I ask are unneccessary and I should just know. I don't call for assistance anymore when I have questions because one supervisor, (mine is nice, but this one has mood swings and favorites) almost made me cry.

        "text": "So I started a new job back in December and while the job itself is far better than the call center I left this one for, my floor lead isn't the best person to deal with. She sits across from me so she's easy access to ask questions to, which should be fine and dandy, right?  Wrong. She's very rude to me and shoos me away most of the time rushing me off. She doesn't explain things well and doesn't let me ask a necessary secondary question when I need assistance. She's gone as far to roll her chair over to me, get in my face, yes like a foot away and yell \"OMG! Preventfalls!! God! Just get them off the phone! I'm busy I can't send you the information you need right now! Ugh!!\"   \n\nI went to HR about the above situation simply because my direct boss was already leaving the company the following week and there was no need to put that on her plate. HR must have talked to my lead because she was a lot nicer for about a month but has slowly become irritated with me again. Just 30 minutes ago I was asking for help on a crazy call with a lady who was just not understanding what she needed to do and my lead flipped at me saying my call was taking to long and kept yelling out so everyone could hear her how long I had been on the phone. Example \"you've been on the phone with her for 17 minutes Preventfalls!!\" Then yell at update about the time because the caller had actually placed the phone down and I couldn't do anything about it. She continued to embarrass me like this and told everyone about it who came up t her.   \n\nShe's always out of line for being a floor lead. She's supposed to be our first go to person if we need help but she doesn't like assisting people. She has her favorites that she likes to talk mad shit about people with; I can hear them whispering all the time. I've also seen call logs of hers where she straight up fucked up and gave incorrect info. I've taken calls from people who she's helped but ended up transferring to A completely incorrect department for no reason and these people call back asking why they were even transferred to someone.  \n\nHow do you all deal with crazy nutsos who oversee you at your job?",

I can understand being mad at that but he was insistent that his plan included Canada wide and I was lying. \n\nI messaged our escalation support and told them the situation and they offered him a plan that was $5 more and included Canada wide calling plus all the long distance charges would be waived.\n\nThat wasn't good enough so I transferred him to the escalations.\n\nLater the escalations manager walked by and mouthed \"what an asshole\". \nTurns out this man would rather cancel all his services and pay over $1000 in cancellation fees(that doesn't include the final bill) then have to pay $5 more for his plan(a plan that was still $25 lower then what it normally went for). He didn't want to change because his plan was supposed to be Canada wide(even though it obviously wasn't and he was offered a good solution) \n\nSome people",

May I ask who I'm speaking with?\n\nC: Ms. Loudmouth Yellyface! Why did you fuckers turn off my tv?!?!\n\nM: I'll be happy to look into that for you. (look over billing ledger) It seems like your service was interrupted because your account is past due in the amount of-\n\nC: Past due?!?! I ain't never been fucking past due! I always pay my bill on time!\n\n(a quick glance at the payment history indicates they have been late on their bill 8 of the last 9 months and had their service interrupted twice before for non-payment)\n\nM: I understand your frustration, but I'm showing we haven't received a payment from you since January 4th.\n\nC: That's impossible! I paid my bill last Thursday. Do you see that on my account?\n\nM: I do not see a payment on that date, ma'am. I do see that you spoke with another one of our agents on that day, however, and that you asked how much was due and when it was due, and they provided you that information. But I see no indication of a payment made that day. As I mentioned, the last payment I see that we got from you was on January 4th.\n\nC: Yeah, I heard you say that, but I don't fucking believe you. I think you're just messing with me because I'm black and live in the ghetto. I want you to turn my service back on right now or I'll call Jesse Jackson on you.\n\n(pull up her address, and she's in the middle of Illinois farm country; ghetto, my ass)\n\nM: I can assure you that's not the case, ma'am. But in order to turn your services back on, we would need a payment of $35.62. Once we get that, your services would be back on about 15 minutes later.\n\nC: Why would I pay that if I already made that payment last Thursday?!?! Can't you see that payment??\n\nM: I don't see one, but it is possible an agent accidentally placed the payment on another account. If you like, I can do some research on payments made with your card to see if that may have happened. If it did, we can correct the mistake and restore your services.\n\nC: Yeah, do that. (under her breath: Stupid ass cracker.)\n\nM: Okay, so in order to do that, I would need the full card number only of that card you used.\n\nC: Yeah, I got it right here. (reads off card number)\n\nM: (plugs card number into payment research tool, finds most recent payment was the previously-mentioned one on Jan 4) So, I ran that card number through our payment history, and the most recent payment I see is the one I mentioned earlier that we got on January 4th.\n\nC: That can't be right! I gave that man that card number and made that payment, and he said I was okay! I think you're just trying to screw me, you racist bitch! I think you got the payment but put it in your bank account instead of putting it toward my payment.\n\n(at this point, I motion to my supervisor that I have a live one and send her an IM that I may need her in a minute)\n\nM: Ma'am, I assure you that's not the case. We have no way of doing that. And I'll please ask you to keep this call professional. I am trying to help you.\n\nC: (insert 10-minute rant, repeating what she already said, along with plenty of abuse toward me, ending with) I think you're just a liar. You're just trying to screw me out of my money because I'm black. The whole lot of you is racist, just taking advantage of poor black people. I work hard for my money and I think y'all are just seeing how far you can push me until I fucking break. Well, I ain't having it! I want you to turn my service back on right now and credit my account for the payment you stole from me.\n\n(at this point, sup is live-monitoring the call and chuckles a little)\n\nM: Ma'am, I cannot do that. That's something only my supervisor can do.\n\nC: Then let me talk to him! He'll turn it back on then fire you for stealing people's money. And what was your name? I'm gonna call the police on your for theft!\n\nM: My name is vbguy77, ma'am, and if you'll allow me to place you on a brief hold, I'll get my supervisor on the line to speak with you.\n\nC: Whatever.\n\nAt this point, I place them on hold and speak with my supervisor.  She tells me that I should get back to them in a moment , tell them I was transferring them and then mute myself. My supervisor said she'll use her ability to inject herself during live monitoring and speak with the customer.\n\nM: Ma'am, thank you for holding. Give me just a moment and I'll get you over to my supervisor so you can speak with her.\n\nC: Oh, it's a woman? I know she'll take care of me. Yeah, put her on.\n\n(I place myself on mute and my sup chimes in)\n\nS: Thank you for holding, my name is Ms. (sup). I understand you're upset about a missing payment.\n\nC: (tone changes to sweetness and light) Yes, I was trying to explain to the young man that I made a payment last Thursday, but he just refused to help me. I would just like to get my service back on. Can you help me?\n\nS: I will do my best to, ma'am. Did my agent ask for the card number to see if the payment got placed on another account by accident? (she was standing next to me when I did)\n\nC: No, he didn't, but I can give you that card number so you can look it up. You ready?\n\nS: Yes. Go ahead with it.\n\nC: (gives card number)\n\nS: Well, I see that the last payment with our system with that card was on January 4th.\n\nC: (changes back to mean and nasty) Well, that's fucking wrong! I gave that man on Thursday my card number and he said the payment went through! Where'd my money go?\n\nS: I don't know, ma'am. I don't see it on our system. Did you confirm with your bank that the payment went through?\n\nC: No, but I'm pulling up my bank account online right now to make sure.\n\n(lots of typing and clicking, with an occasional muttered expletive)\n\nC: Well, I don't see it on my account. Maybe he didn't take the payment. I gave him my card number, though. Why didn't he take my payment?\n\nS: I'm not sure ma'am. We have that card saved on file already. Did you want to go ahead and make that payment now so we can get your services restarted?\n\nC: Yeah, go ahead.\n\nS: (confirms name on card, processes payment) So,  your service should be back on in about 10-15 minutes. Is there anything else I can help you with today?\n\nC: Well, like I said, the young man I spoke to before you was very unprofessional. He refused to help me, and I think he was even a bit racist towards me. I think he needs to be disciplined or even fired.\n\nS: It's funny you mention that, ma'am, because I was listening to the call. I heard what he said and what you said. If anyone was racist and rude, it was you towards him.\n\nC: I, but...\n\nS: He was very professional towards you while you were verbally abusing him, more than he probably should have been. I counted at least five times he would have been justified in ending the call, but he tried his best to help you out.\n\nC: Well, I-\n\nS: (with a full head of steam now) I'm not finished yet. If you ever accuse anyone else here of racism when none was there, we will make sure that your service is cancelled outright and you are no longer a customer of ours, and I'm noting your account accordingly. Besides, how can he be racist towards you if he can't even see you?\n\nC: Umm...\n\nS: That's what I thought. Now, before I end this call, was there anything else I can help you with?\n\nC: Uh, no.\n\nS: Then you have a good day.\n\nMy sup then told me to take a break and relax for a few minutes before lunch, which she treated me to. She mentioned during lunch that she was going to use my call as an example in the next   supervisor meeting of how to handle rude customers.",

It's pretty exhausting, and it doesn't help that I work 10 hours days. But that's not what really gets to me. No, what grinds my will down to a stump is having to fight with callers all day long.\n\nAt my job, we take calls for both our national 1-800 number and also our retail stores. 80% of our volume is from these retail stores. A significant portion of those callers are instantly suspicious that they called the wrong place. \"Are you with the XY store?\", to which I'll respond, \"I'm with the Z Online Store, but I do support the XY Store, what can I help you with?\". This goes either one of two ways; the customer says \"oh, ok\" and we have a normal call, or they get combative. Those are the fun ones.\n\nMe: \"Hello, thank you for calling X, my name is JohnBigBootey, how can I help you today?\"\n\nAngry Man Child: \"WHERE ARE YOU.\"\n\n\n(Thankfully, my phone tells me what retail store they called, so I go into the spiel I do dozens of times a day)\n\nMe: \"I'm with the Z Online Store, but I do support the XY Store, what can I help you with?\"\n\nAMC: *heavy sigh* GET ME SOMEONE FROM XY ON THE LINE.\n\n(If I was rational, I'd realize that I wouldn't want to talk to this man anyways. However, I'm heavily encouraged to \"engage with the customer\" and have calls as long as possible, so I do my best.)\n\nMe: \"I can get XY on the line if need be, but I have access to all their tools, what's going on?\"\n\nAMC continues in a measured, overly-sweet tone to let me know he's barely containing his roid rage.\n\nAMC: ...\"I don't  think you can. If the store replaces a battery in my tablet, will it be a new battery, or an old one?\"\n\nMe: \"Let me make sure I understand, you're wondering if we put a new battery in your tablet, will it be a new battery?\"\n\nAMC: *loud sigh* \"THIS WAS WHY I WANTED TO TALK WITH XY STORE. YES, THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO KNOW, MY TABLET ISN'T CHARGING.\"\n\nMe: \"If your tablet isn't charging, they'll take a look at it and see what's wrong. If it's the battery, they can replace just the battery. If it's something else, they'll let you know what your options are.\"\n\nAMC pauses for a bit, unsure how to continue.\n\nAMC: ...\"How do I know you're telling the truth? YOU'RE NOT XY STORE!\"\n\nWell, I can't question that logic. I bottle away my feelings with the others and say \"Let me get them on the line, one moment\" and transfer him. Another 1.5 minute call goes under my belt, sinking my close rate that much further.",

The dialler is killing me mentally and spiritually - the lack of call gaps and the non stop morons on the other end is actually taking little parts of my excitement for life every day. \n\nThe biggest problem is that just prior to me getting this job, the company was bought over by a large outsourcing and call centre firm, and now the stats (albeit resisted by our actual company's directors) that you'd associate with a call centre are coming back in to place - AHT, PPH(revenue), time spent in 'productive' time, and the threat of complaints (that up until last month were never taken seriously) pop up whenever a debtor gets their feelings hurt. \n\nUpwards progression is easier in this company than lateral movement; they never advertise positions open in collections or administration, and only advertise jobs which are low in quantity. \n\nI'd like to stay in this company but the thought of dealing with the general public en mass makes me feel ill.

Accounts then validated by sending the customer a security code via email/ text. \n\nWe also had a 16-digit credit card search that was to be used in absolute last resort (when doing a card search, subs attached to the card can be canceled and the card removed, but the system would not let us process refunds with a search).\n\nThis story revolves around a guy who had to skip to that last step, but he had special circumstances requiring such intervention. Me will be me and SM will be Sad Guy.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMe: Thank you for contacting **major company** customer support. My name is PussySharts. How can I help you today?\n\nSG: I have an account with you that I need to cancel.\n\nMe: Alright. May I start by getting the account alias?\n\nSG: Here's the thing. The account is set up under my ex-wife's information, but my credit card was used on the account.\n\nMe: When I look up the account, it is then validated by sending a security code via text or email. Is there anyway you can get in contact with her to validate the account?\n\nSG: I can't really do that. I just left her. I was with her for many years, and she was verbally and physically abusive. She was abusive to me and our son. I decided to do the right thing and took myself and my child out of that situation. We are at an in-between house right now and working on moving in with my parents until we get out lives together. \n\nMe: Okay. Based on what you told me, our normal account validation methods are not going to work here. We are still able to search the account in the system. If you are willing to give me your full 16-digit credit card number, I can search it in the system and find all accounts opened with it, which sounds like just the one. If you have your credit card with you, is this a step you are willing to do?\n\nSG: Yes, I have it with me.\n\nMe: Before we continue, I will tell you right now that the card search will only show me the type of subscriptions are on the account, dates of charges, and an option to cancel. I will not have the ability to refund anything.\n\nSG: That's fine, I just want to be sure that she can never use my card on your company again.\n\nMe: Alright. What type of card do you have and the full 16-digit number?\n\nSG: It is a **card** and the number is XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX.\n\n(I hit search, and the system pulls up a result).\n\nMe: Just like I thought, it pulled up only one result. Let's see what subscription is on this card and get it removed.\n\nMe: It looks like a X-month subscription was charged on the card about 5 days ago. I am just going to cancel that for you right now.\n\nSG: Thanks so much!\n\nMe: That is canceled. Now let's get this card off the account. \n\n(I go to remove the card, but see an issue. Since it was a sub longer than 30 days and canceled within 30 days, the system automatically processed a refund. However, I am not able to remove a card if there is a balance owed, whether they owe us or we owe them. It has to be settled and a balance of $0 before the card can be taken off.)\n\nMe: Okay, since the sub was canceled within 30 days, our system automatically processed a refund. That means the money will be going back onto your card. Unfortunately, until that refund goes back onto your card, we won't be able to remove the card. The best option is to watch your statements until the money goes back in, then call us back and we will gladly remove the card after a card search. \n\nSG: I understand you wanting to help, but I really want the card removed. She was a very abusive woman, so I don't doubt that she will want to spend on the card to get back at me for leaving. Is there any way to override the refund? I don't care about getting the money back. All I want is for her to not be able to use my card.\n\nMe: Let me put you on a 2 minute hold to see if I can override the refund and remove the card.\n\n(Mute phone. Have finger on hold button. I hit reload in the system. Just as I'm about to put him on hold, I see that the refund has been processed and resolved. He is at a $0 balance and the card can now be removed.)\n\nMe: Actually never mind. I just reloaded the account, and the refund has been resolved. It should be back in your account within 7 days. It looks like I can remove that card now..... and done!\n\nSG: Thank you so much. You are a god send! I appreciate all your help! I feel so relieved now that I have one less thing to worry about. Now I can continue putting my life back together.\n\nMe: I'm glad I could help. I really hope your life situation improves. If there isn't anything else you need help with, have a good night, and take it one day at a time.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLike the title said, I felt bad for the guy. When he talked, he sounded like he was a broken human being. He seemed like he was overall decent and trying his best to make life better for him and his child. I was just glad that I was able to help him, because it was probably the only good thing to happen to him in a while. ",

        "text": "I work for one of the most hated Cable Companies in America, in an inbound call center, helping repair video. This was back in my training days. \n\nFella calls in, and from his voice I'm guessing he's probably mid 50's with a slight disability. Genuinely nice fella, account has been paid in full every month for years, nothing is broken. \n\nSo far, so good.  \n\nTurns out that he needs help ordering movies, because he can't read - but he can spell out letters, can I help him with the titles?  \n\nSo Older Fella (OF) asks middle aged me (MAM) to help him find something entertaining. \nWorth mentioning; I'm a woman in my mid 40's but have a young sounding voice.\n\nI was (at that point) in a full call center, with my partner doubled in and listening, surrounded by classmates and my teacher. \n\n~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~*~ ~*~ ~*~ \n\nOF - I need help with these words, can you help me? \n\nMAM - absolutely!  Spell them out and we'll figure them out together. \n\n\n... they were porn. All of them were adult movies, and he just needed help getting films of \"the pretty ladies he liked to watch\" \n\nGlad he got me, because I'm unflappable. So off we went....\n\nI explained about 15 altogether, but these are the later ones that stand out in my memory. \nAt this point I was getting a little punchy. \nAlso, the reactions from the people around me were funny as hell but kind of distracting\n\n***\n\nOF - okay, C-R-E-A-M...C-R-A-V-I-N-G-...C-O-U-G-A-R-S...3\n\nMAM - Okay, that's Cream Craving Cougars Three - sounds like a trilogy, did you catch the first two? \n***\nOF - D-O-M-I-N-A-T-R-I-X D-U-N-G-E-O-N-\n\nMAM - um, that's \"Dominatrix Dungeon\" \n\nOF - what's a Dominatrix?\n\nMAM - uh, that's a movie where grown ups paddle each others heinies \n\nOF - oh, no, don't think I'd like that\n\nMAM - OK, what do you like?\n\nOF - I like two girls \n\nMAM - well, who doesn't? Lets see what we can find for you..\n\n***\n\nGot him off (hurr) the call a few minutes later, because his pay per view was about to start. \n\nWhen I hung up, I looked around and saw the carnage.\n\nMy partner had been laughing so hard he was crying, some of my more sheltered classmates looked faintly shell shocked, and my instructor said \"good call\" ... because it's a product we sell, and we can't be shy about that kind of thing. \n\nStill, never thought I'd be reading out explicit porn titles in a room full of professionals in a business setting. Good times. ",
