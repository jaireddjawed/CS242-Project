        "text": "A few weeks ago, I posted about starting anxiety meds.  They helped a lot.  However, I cannot take this particular med every day.  I take a very small dose every other day.  It covers me for about a day and a quarter.  The remaining 3/4's of a day hurt.  I'm back to feeling like I'm screaming on the inside.  But, hey, even with that, I've been very grateful for the meds.  I've never been this calm in my life and I appreciate the break I'm getting from this med.\n\nI saw my psychiatrist again.  He added another med that I can take every day and it should help get me through the time periods when I cannot take the first med.  OMG.  It works.  I feel better.  I feel so much better.  \n\nWhat is really striking to me is all the things I accepted as normal (most of the time) that I now know was just horrible anxiety.  I had pain all the time and all over my body.  I was tired all the time and almost everything hurt.  It was this constant pain... not a huge pain, but constant and all over my upper body.  It started when I was in high school and I've never been free of it since.  If it was just a few days of that pain, it wouldn't bother me, but it has been every day of my life for over 20 years.  Guys, THE PAIN IS FUCKING GONE.  IT'S GONE.  I feel so light.  It is SO MUCH easier to get things done without the constant droning on pain in the background.  It is so much easier to be the person I want to be without the constant droning of fucking pain in the background.  I'm getting things done.  I've probably never been this productive in my life, which is exactly what I need right now because I have a hectic schedule every day without a lot of down time.  Now, this all seems manageable.  I'm doing it without utter fucking misery of pain and a brain that is hypervigilant and can barely fucking focus.\n\nI am so grateful for all this.  It's not perfect, but it's so much better.  It's amazing.  \n\nSo, now I'm exploring other body signals.  I used to very faintly feel fatigue or hunger or sickness or fullness.  They felt like the whisper of a suggestion... until I ignored them so long that I was on the verge of fainting.  I was constantly driving myself to blacking out or dry heaving by just ignoring my body.  \n\nNow, that the pain and fog is mostly gone, I hear the signals loud and clear.  I have been eating before I'm starving or almost blacking out.  I've been resting before I'm almost keeled over, etc.  Life is so much easier with clear body signals to follow.  Who knew?!  (Not me, apparently.)  \n\nI've always found self-care to be one of the biggest struggles of my life.  Now it's simple.  It's not perfect.  But, it's so much better.  I have more choices - choices I never had before.  I have information that I've desperately needed for such a long time and I'm enjoying acting on it.   It's awesome.  \n\nLife definitely isn't perfect.  But, being relieved of constant pain is kickass.  I couldn't even remember what life was like without it.  I'm so grateful for my doctor and these medications... they have truly been life altering.  \n\nAt the same time, it is amazing to me that all this pain was just anxiety related.  I mean... my docs have been telling me for years that it was mental illness related, because they could find no other cause and we all knew about my PTSD, depression, axiety, etc.  Deep down, some part of me is even more horrified at what my parents did to me, because they hurt me in more ways than I realized, because I am sure the pain was related to the PTSD and anxiety and I'm pretty darn sure that those things are related to the over 20 years of insane abuse they put me through.  Deep down, a very small part of me is furious and deeply sad about these realizations.  I'm processing it.  I'll be okay.  Mostly, I will try to focus on the positives, since there are a lot of those right now.  :)\n\nEdit (8/6/2016):  YES! I can now stretch my back without the guaranteed charlie horse cramp I got every time I stretched before.  Just stretching when I woke up in the morning was an urge I had to stifle, unless I wanted the charlie horse cramp from hell all along my back and maybe even up my fucking neck.  I CAN STRETCH!  This is awesome!  It has been very difficult for me to deny the instinct to stretch, especially in the morning, so I have had a lot of painful cramps most days.  I have also had to be very careful when exercising not to stretch in certain ways or I'll be in charlie horse hell.  It's gone!  Woot!",

When I went NC, I didn't announce it, I just decided I never want to see them again, stopped all contact, blocked them and got off social media so I don't see references to them. The N never asked why, they knew why. \n\nHow have you handled these situations where your abuser will also be present, but you desperately want to be at the event? It's not an event I'm willing to miss, but when I think of seeing the N, my brain screams \"NO.\" I won't interact, but just seeing them will likely set me back. And if they try to interact, which I think may happen, I'll have to leave. \n\nMy spouse, therapist, and sibling all think it won't be easy, but I'll be fine. My therapist doesn't want me to miss out on life out of fear. They just do not understand the impact it has on me internally. I'm so terrified. My body goes cold and my stomach knots thinking about it. I'm terrified I'll be down for weeks or months after, terrified of the nightmares coming back, terrified of hearing the N's voice. \n\nI just don't see how it'll be \"strong\" to put myself through contact, but when I think about not being at this event, that's worse. Thoughts? How did you do it?",

        "text": "Not sure what triggered the memory, but another thread about the peer-pressure to love your parents when they're toxic assholes got it going:\n\nit just occurred to me that the last time my parents physically assaulted me, they were 38 and 36 respectively - Nmom pulling me into a closet to hold my mouth closed while kicking the hell out of me - and when I escaped, Ndad came out and straight up punched me in the face.\n\nOf course my classmates noticed and got the principal to call child protection (no small feat for the early 80s) and I wasn't removed from the home (instantly my classmate's parents got the news and offered to take me in, child protection said no - ffs)  But having to deal with a big-city child agency instead of the small-town agencies where we'd lived before, the Ns couldn't wriggle around the intervention, and Ndad would've lost his job if charged.\n\nOf course I never heard the end of my \"betrayal\" and how \"we didn't whip you and we did get whipped as kids so you're weak and whiny\" . Because Ns.\n\nAnyway what occurred to me is:  I'm a few years past the age they were when this happened.  Somehow, despite all my getting punched and kicked, I have never punched a 6th-grader in the face and then acted like I was justified. I can't even imagine how this seems like an okay option for dealing with kids... even at the time it was entirely WTF this is crazy abuse.\n\nIf I met my Nparents at a party or at work, and found out what they'd done, I'd nope the hell out asap.  So would everyone I know - and if I and my buddies heard about such a situation, we'd make sure it never happened again by giving the Nparents a taste of their own violence.\n\nSo this bad memory led to validation - the Ns were child abusers to my mind in 6th grade, and as an adult they're chid abusers in my opinion and my friends' too.  They are horrible people who have no place in civilized society, let alone in my own life!  NC is the least they deserve.\n\nFlea squashed.",

It's been the best decision I ever made and I've grown so much in this time.\n\nHowever, I am starting a new business and as a part of this the company I work for have put me in contact with a 'mentor' to help me as I set up. \n\nLast week I had one of the worst weeks of my life, and I had to consider going on medication to help me through. Since NC I have not felt this bad, especially enough to consider medication. \n\nNow I realise that this 'mentor' I have is triggering me. He acts virtually the same as a my Nfather. He has done nothing specifically but in each interaction with him he is negative about what I suggest. If I said black he would say white.\n\nI just recently found a colleague who has also had terrible experiences with him. \n\nMy question is how do I deal with this? I have no desire to ever speak to the man again, in fact the prospect of it makes me feel sick and my 'fight or flight' kicks in.\n\nDo I approach this man's boss and ask for another mentor or do I just let it lie and ignore my current mentor? I suppose my question is do I go all out and complain to my boss or ignore it and hope that they realise? \n\nI feel like this is a test of the new NC me.

        "text": "Hi, LAN (waves)\n\nI haven't exactly been active on here the past few months, but I wanted to give you guys an update - and also to just, I don't know, vent?\n\nIt's my Nmother's birthday tomorrow, and I didn't really know it until last weekend, but it's been affecting me a lot lately. It's the first one in my entire life where I am not the doting daughter. \n\nI am constantly kind of expecting a fallback from her; over the past few months, she's been showing her N to other family members. I'm VLC with a big ol' gray rock thrown in there, steadily working towards NC. However, it's beginning to seep through that she's moaning about me to my aunt and uNcle. \n\nSpecific example: I live in another country, and I went home for a week during July. Spent a day with my cousin and his family. Pictures were posted to Facebook. Nmom's reply: \"hmm, glad you've had a good day - not sure how happy I am that this is how I learn she's even in the country\". uNcle's reply: \"Oh, Tetusora's mom, I understand you so well.\"\n\nLater, at cousin's child's birthday, a friend of the family asked my mom how I'm doing. She threw a fit at this poor person, which eventually resulted in her trantrum'ing that \"how the hell should I know, maybe you should just ask [cousin's wife]!\". After which uNcle and aunt moaned at said wife that it's horrible that I don't even let my family know when I'm home. No, as you can guess, they have never asked, ever.\n\nWhile I'm proud at myself for being able to have a certain distance to her words and see them af pure N, I also feel haggard and frustrated that it's affecting other people now. \n\nIn the meantime, my spouse and I have decided to buy a house and to \"stop actively preventing having babies\". While that latter phrase sounds cold, it's not: it's because we really, really want to have them babies, but we don't want to be caught in the \"we're trying for them\" sentiment yet, because there's a certain amount of \"awww, you poor guys\" for every month of \"failure\". \n\nAs you can imagine, these two decisions are sending all kinds of emotions flaring around in my body: Will I end up being a hoarder like my mother? How the hell will I be able to keep a house, since I never really learned? Am I emotionally grown up enough to be able to teach a child love and compassion? What if my mother was like me before she had me, and I'll just break into Nhood alongside parenthood? etc etc\n\nIn the meanwhile, I've started seeing a councilor here in the UK, for the last month or two before going home. I spent my initial hour accounting for how I think my mother is an N and told her the same [story of my epiphany](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3ye7ep/was_i_raised_by_a_narcissist/) as you guys as well as [some memories](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/41200x/the_thoughts_that_keep_me_up_at_night_rantvent/), and she was genuinely warm and comforting. She is all behind me breaking contact and just focussing on myself. So that's really good - I feel safe going forward with her.\n\nThis is all kind of jumbled. I've not felt like I've needed RBN or LAN for a while, because I was over my initial epiphany and felt very strong and secure in my process. But these days, I am so emotionally worn. Between being in a long distance marriage, having changes happen in my life, having a lot of crap to deal with at work (redundancies, anyone? Yeah? Yeah.) and all the other stuff, I am torn in between missing my mommy and wanting to never talk to her again. \n\nSo I just wanted to reach out to some people that understand. Thanks for being here.

They are divorced and he rarely speaks with her, but I've noticed a similar pattern. I get a lot of things blamed on me, especially being the oldest. There's a lot of tension and it's been suggested that my mom and dad only got together because I was conceived, so perhaps I'm the starting point in all this. \n\nAnyway, today something happened that really made me upset. My dad never cooks or gets groceries cause he's always busy with work and his girlfriend, so....like always....he texts my two younger siblings and I what we want from a fastfood place. My siblings both want these jr. bacon cheeseburgers with no toppings on them. I ask for just a typical normal adult cheeseburger (cause they are 10 and 11. I'm 20) . It has everything on it I want. It would be an easy order. When my dad gets home I learn he decided to get all three of us the jr. bacon cheeseburger cause it would be cheaper. Mine isn't plain like the other two but it has absolutely NOTHING I requested. Because he got me a completely different item it had none of the things I wanted on it, but it has a lot of things I didn't. It was just mayo and bacon (and the typical lettuce and cheese).  I didn't want either of those which is why I picked the other burger....that also had ketchup, onion, pickles, and mustard. I was obviously visually upset. I tried to shrug it off and get ketchup from the fridge....except it had been expired for a long time. Dad told me there should be a new one in the cabinet, and when I spoke up that there wasn't he suddenly got super angry. He said sarcastically \"Sorrrry, guess next time I'll spend the extra dollar for just a,b,and c on your burger.\" went on a rant and basically ended it saying \"FINE! I'll go get ketchup for you from the store since you're going to be so upset about it!\". He slammed the door before I could even say anything. \n\nI know this is just a cheeseburger, but stuff like this happens a lot and it makes me feel not cared for/forgotten about(?). Things like getting everyone else candy but me, casually forgetting to tell me about events, and getting angry at my emotions. I feel a lot of guilt and can't ever really win. For example, I'm practically in charge of my siblings all day, but I'm not allowed to punish them whatsoever. If I do, my dad basically tells my siblings to ignore me. If I DON'T punish them, and they do something bad than *I* get in trouble for not correcting them. This allows my siblings to walk all over me all the time. I could go on and on...",

I've been in therapy for a few years now and I know I'll be spending the rest of my life healing.\n\nI've been a huge proponent of self care and self love...it's what saved me....but lately I'm not sure if it's leading to my downfall. Especially when it comes to close relationships, I often champion my own feelings to the point that I'm making my partner feel unheard when it comes to their feelings.\n\nI'm struggling to find a balance between feeling heard (something I know we all have fought for) and also making others feel heard as well. I truly do not want this hurt my relationships because I do indeed empathize and care about their feelings. I think given my experiences I've felt so strongly about protecting myself and feeling heard that it's now hindering my ability to be the empathetic listener that I know I am capable of being. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice/similar experiences?

        "text": "Hey everyone. It's been a long time since I've stopped by here – 7 months in fact. I stopped visiting to RBN because reading and commenting there had become another one of the many distractions I used so I wouldn't have to deal with my emotions. I've started therapy in earnest since then, using IRRT. It's going good so far, and I mostly dealt with a specific memory of my nsister being horrible to me when I was 6 or 7.\n\nHowever, I had known since before therapy began that my mother was at the core of the problem, but dealing with her abuse was harder for me. I kept \"forgetting\" about the things I had already realised, even though I had written them down, I felt guilty for not being in contact with her – after all, what had she ever done to deserve this, wasn't the problem on my side, and was my problem really so severe that I had to hurt her, too, by not speaking to her?\n\nThis had been bothering me for quite a while now; as I progressed with IRRT and dealt with my sister's rather blunt psychological abuse, my mother popped up again and again, I started reading my notes and still felt I owed her more attention. Today, with my therapist, I went back to a memory of an interaction with my mother when I was 5 or 6 years. Looking back now, it's rather obvious; *it was all about her*. To give you all a general idea, asking my mother for something, or just being in need of something was a terrible thing, and she always made a big show of how much it affected her, how bad it made her feel. That made me realise that \"showing (negative) emotions/being in need of support = hurting my mother\". It was, however, equally important that she could see herself as a good mother, so being in pain and not coming to her = Just as bad.\n\nIn short, I re-lived a scene in which the above became evident and my younger self was caught in a no-win, double-bind situation. I talked it through with my younger self after I had thrown my mother out of the room, and after some talking he said \"Well, but that would mean that my mother's evil, doesn't it?\"\n\nWe had to stop the IRRT session at this point, as I couldn't go any further. The emotional knowledge, not just the rational one, that my mother's not on my side and never had been was deeply painful and draining, but I think from this point on, I'll be able to move forward at much greater ease.\n\nI hope you all are having a great day :) Just wanted to put it in writing and share it with a community that might understand.",

        "text": "Hey everyone!  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nI've been a long time lurker and both RBN and LAN have been great resources for me in realizing that my family was, in fact, dysfunctional, and that the things that are „wrong“ with me (like low self-esteem, abandonment issues, social anxiety, depression) are not the product of some fatal flaw in me (cue E/N-Mom: „Why do you always make things so difficult for yourself?“), but the result of my family life and the lies they implicitly and explicitly told me about myself and the world.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nWhich has been very freeing, but recently (starting about 1 year ago), when I started really processing everything and finding the right words for it, I also started having (or noticing?) what Pete Walker describes as emotional flashbacks – intense episodes of emotional pain, fear, anger or sadness, triggered by present situations, feelings or thought, but actually rooted in my childhood, and which seemingly can only be resolved by finding their source in my childhood and crying my heart out about it (or raging and screaming at my pillows, imagining my family). Afterwards I do often feel a bit lighter, like something has been resolved, but also drained.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nComing to the reason for this post -  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nIn the last couple of weeks (preceding and following a short trip to my home town for my Ngrandfather's birthday, family interaction on maximum level) these „episodes“ got incredibly frequent, up to several times a day, and much more intense. They seem to be on a hair trigger - there ARE triggers for them, but they are becoming increasingly minor.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nAlso, they are seriously interfering with my life - I might have to postpone an important exam which is in 10 days, because I wasn't able to study much. I'll try to catch up, but it's possible I won't make it (which is more inconvenient than a catastrophe, but I would prefer if I didn't have to).  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nAlso, I have difficulties being around my friends and boyfriend, because I don't want to \"drag them down\" (I do recognize this as internalised N-voice. It's still there, though.).  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nI understand why they come up more frequently now, and have been able to resolve all of them so far without harming myself or others (though especially the first point takes some major impulse control sometimes). But it takes time and is incredibly painful and draining.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nConsidering the \"price\" I am currently paying in energy and time for this emotional work, what I want to ask is – has any of you experienced something similar during their recovery? Is this actually something good, as one of my ACoN-friends insists, and the road to healing (aka „integrating traumatic experiences“), and I'll be glad for it later? Or will it become worse and worse, leading me nowhere?  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nSo, basically – am I on the right track by working through this the way I do, or should I try to stuff it away (not sure if I even could) and focus on functioning?  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \n(I think I kinda know the answer, but I feel like I really need some outside perspective...)  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nOn a side note – I am in therapy for the above mentioned general problems (depression etc.), but my therapist is currently on holiday, and anyway not very interested in the flashbacks. I guess because she doesn't really understand them (C-PTSD is not a widely known concept around here). I'm also (partly because of that) about to ditch her and look into other therapists specialised in trauma, but there are few in my area and it will take another couple of months until I'll be able to talk to a professional about this.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nAny advice/perspective would be greatly appreciated :)  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n    \nEDIT: ~~Also, I can't seem to figure out how to format this, to make it less of a wall of text. Sorry 'bout that...~~ Nevermind, found it ^^",

        "text": "I just read a post on RBN about a girl whose grandmother sends her over the top messages. As I was reading the grandmother's messages I recognised the kind of phrases she uses as things that I feel too. I don't send messages like that, I hold it back as much as I can. I know it's over the top so I try to hide it.\n\nThen I read a great reply from encatidated and I'm just horrified. The things he/she says... this is me. This is how I am. Right back to my teens and my first boyfriend at 15. Even before then I used to get obsessive crushes on boys and dream about getting creepy stalker adulating love from them. As an adult I've felt like this about all my boyfriends. The older I've got the more I hold it inside instead of unleashing it all but still, it's in there. People might be able to tell, I don't know.\n\nThese are the points that encatidated made that describe me:  \n* she is overly intimate with you for her emotional needs.  \n* Boundary-less individuals think love-bombing feels great so they don't see why anyone would not want it. They don't see how they are making the other person responsible for their feelings. What the are thinking is \"This would be so wonderful to hear. It must work to bring them back to me. Who wouldn't want to be in system that adores and loves them like this?\".  \n* she is acting like you are PART of her.   \n* that is is your \"job\" to make her feel \"loved,\" or special, or connected.   \n* She is putting into your person the responsibility for her feeling loved. She is making you her drug  \n* there is a trend with these types that only one person can make them feel loved at a time. If they are getting it from someone else, they don't need it from you at the time. But if they want it from you, the love of others won't do  \n* I do not love my sister the way I do my husband, or him the way I love my nephew, but I love all of them and they all bring me joy without needing to switch between them. Enmeshing narcs like your grandma don't seem to understand that, so all they can use is the creepy stalkery adulating \"love\" that they expect for themselves. \n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with me? Is this codependency or something else? How can I ever even tell this to a therapist to get help with it, it's so shameful. I have no idea what to do.",

        "text": "*You'll see my other post I've made. I can honestly say that it was a couple of months ago that I made a massive effort to be healthier, to put boundaries in place for myself and be less clingy towards people. Every time I've felt like I need him to cheer me up I've purposely NOT contacted him. Lately I've wanted to tell him that I miss him but I haven't said anything. I thought I was doing the right thing so joke's on me I guess. I'm an unwanted fuckup either way.*\n\nI don't have any friends but 8 months ago I started talking to someone online and he became my friend. We have similar problems and we talked about them and our recovery, because I was about to start therapy. We were really supportive of each other and he said things like we were friends for life and that he would be with me every step of the way. We got on really well, having similar interests and had a great rapport. It meant so much to me to finally be able to say \"my friend...\" like normal people do. I was so grateful that he was around.\n\nThen some cracks appeared. When I leaned on him for support he became dismissive. When I need some reassurance and sympathy he gets impatient with me for not taking his advice to keep busy and active. I do try to take his advice, he only remembers the times I don't. He's extremely sensitive to any hint of confrontation. One day he reminded me of something I found upsetting and when I got annoyed and asked why would he say that, he ended up having a panic attack and I had to comfort him. I tried to support him with this Flea and talk it through with him but didn't really get anywhere.\n\nI've tried to readjust my boundaries to protect myself better. I've been understanding and kind to him because I know he has a lot of Fleas. I've tried to accept him for who he is, thinking that if I'm reliable and solid then maybe that will help him. We're friends for life, right? So there's no question of me giving up on him.\n\nHe hasn't initiated contact with me for 2 months now, I've started every conversation. He always says he's been busy. Last week I sent him 3 messages on Facebook Messenger asking if he was around and if he was okay, but he didn't reply at all. I tried email instead saying I was worried about him, he finally replied saying he's really really busy. I replied with some chatty friendly stuff and he told me he found a girlfriend and that he's not using Messenger anymore. Messenger is our primary way of communicating and he didn't tell me he wasn't using it anymore. He just left me to send messages that he would never receive.\n\nI replied saying it was great news about his girlfriend and that ignoring me wasn't a nice way to treat me. I asked him some questions about his new job. I've had no response to that even though he's been posting to his Facebook page and pinning things on Pinterest. He's got time to do that but no time to reply to me.\n\nI don't even know what I've done wrong. We've been getting on fine for a while now so he just seems to have got fed up with me. He's too busy for me. I'm basically ignorable and discardable. It's like he's put me in the trash and closed the lid because he doesn't want to hear me. My friend for life has disappeared.\n\nI've talked to my therapist but she doesn't seem to understand how hard this is for me. She just sees someone who treats me badly and thinks I should find a different friend. I can't face trying to make another friend, it's too painful. Everyone who's ever called themselves my friend has ended up abandoning me, I can't face it again. It hurts :(\n",

All of her other families are on the school schedule because they all work for the schools (I used to when we started with her). We've been with them since my son was 11 months old. He's now 3.5 years old. We've been part time the last 2 school years bc of my job when I quit teaching. We had a lot of instability in pay and when we needed her but he went basically every week and we always paid (just sometimes she'd have to wait until our pay day or weekly instead of monthly). But she's been to pretty much every major event in his life. She's been a constant. We trust and adore her. \n\nWhen I found out about my new full time, regular hours job, I've been asking when she's opening for the school year and how much it would be for two kids. She ignored some of my messages and eventually said she wasn't opening until the school year but didn't answer any of my other questions. Today I messaged her again asking for rates and her opening day. That's when she sent me a text back saying she couldn't take my kids. She said she had been looking for an extra pair of hands and hasn't found anyone. She said she could watch them short term until we found someone. I'm devastated. I haven't told my son yet who loves her. He didn't get to say goodbye to his friends. I'm honestly more upset for him and myself than he will be. \n\nSo here's the thing. I think it's more than just not having extra help. I think that's a convenient excuse. I think she's known for a while and hasn't told us. I wish I knew weeks ago when I was looking for alternative care before I started my new job to minimize the transitions for my kids. I asked her if it was just that or if it was something specifically about us. She hasn't responded and that was hours ago. I have day care set up until the last week of August so I have some time to find a replacement but I'm so upset, I'm sick to my stomach. I don't want to leave my newborn with just anyone. we trusted her. My husband says either this is personal or highly unprofessional. Or both. \n\nI'm just devastated and flabbergasted.

Fair enough, and perhaps even a genuine help to their spouses.\n\nThis week's health update email blast has a sentence each about the two seriously ill relatives, but is mostly about his upcoming day surgery for a quality-of-life procedure, with multiple links so we can learn more about what he'll be going through, a list of rules for contact with him over the next week given what he'll be going through, etc.\n\nNow, I'm not discounting his need/desire for the procedure which will hopefully improve some things for him.  \n\nBut, it's a day procedure.

Towards the end of our relationship, after so many times of splitting up only to have him reel me back in again, I did pick up one effective point that shut him up - in instances when he would go full narc-rage on me for how 'unsatisfied you always are' when I'd actually stand up for myself, I'd just say, 'Well, you're the one who keeps crawling back to me every time I break up with you,' and that would usually shut him up.  It was my last resort to stop any further harassment, and it never felt good to stoop down to his level and be so negative and derogatory, but it felt like my only option at the time.\n\nSo I believe that his game now is that he is purposefully keeping himself from contacting me because if he does it will justify my earlier comments about him constantly 'crawling back to me,' and his big bad ego just can't handle me being right about how needy he actually is.  But he is using the dog as a means to make me want to contact him without him actually having to do anything.  As much as it worries me to know that the dog (Darling) is stuck there with him, I am dedicated to staying NC.  Honestly, leaving Darling was a million times harder than leaving the Nex, but I know now that he is counting on me breaking NC because of the dog, just so he can say that I'm the one 'crawling back' to him.  That ain't gonna happen.  \n\nI am still concerned about what happens after he realizes that his latest ploy is ineffective.  From information I've found, it seems like the first year or so is kind of a 'hot zone' for narcs trying to wedge themselves back in, so I'm worried that he'll resort to his previous tactics full-force before I've heard the last from him.  I've followed through on the advice I received on my previous post, and I keep reminding myself that the most important thing now is that I am free and am moving on with my life and protecting and healing myself!  \n\nThanks again for the support, advice, kind words, and non-judgment here in this sub.  It's hard to express this with my family or friends - they try to get it, but they really don't 'get' it.  ",

If they would say the sky was green, they could convince me it was even if I was looking at it. This also applied to my thoughts. I was reflecting their negative thinking and demanded to control what my wife did. I still thought it was appropriate to act like that, but when I went too far and started belittling her cat too she finally had enough and set some boundaries. With a lot of effort from both our sides I managed to kill most of my fleas.\n\nWhen I was mostly recovered last year and saw my Nparents less and less. My wife could tell when I visited them, because I acted differently each time I returned. I still couldn't tell at that time, because I thought it was normal.\n\nI threw a birthday party, to which my Nparents and GC N younger sis were invited. First they arrived 1.5 hours late, then started belittling my wife, me, her cat, our horses, her mom (who was invited too) and our home. This was the first time I realized how negative they were about everything.\n\nLater on in the evening I had to put the horses back into the stables and I thought 'stupid horses, come back!', instead of my normal 'It's great to see you again, want to go back to your stable?'. This was the first time I noticed how their negativity affected me, it was a whole different mindset.\n\nA few months later I went NC, but from time to time this behavior returns. I criticize everything and act like a jerk. The last time was 2 days ago, it persisted through my sleep and was only ended yesterday by me lying down next to the (sleeping) horses and really calming down.\n\nIt can happen more subtly too, and it usually manifests itself with negative thinking and not acting like I normally do. How can I better detect this is happening, and move out of that negative 'mood' as soon as I realize it's happening?",

        "text": "Hey guys. So, this past weekend I went to my best friend's wedding. The wedding was in DC; I live in Los Angeles. I ended up making out with one of my friend's coworkers, but I couldn't actually have sex with him because I disassociate completely during physical intimacy. The situation was strange (I was staying in my friend's apartment watching his dog for budgetary reasons; one of his other friends was also staying there and was a total narc, so sleeping with a guy in the apartment would have been odd-ish.) But I felt really bad afterward because the guy I made out with was sweet as fuck, was a giant nerd like me, we talked about sports for like an hour etc. He was just generally really genuinely sweet. *Two days* after this, I realized I'd have been fine if I'd slept with him. That, in fact, it was the perfect opportunity to finally have sex. I'm 28f, barely ever even kissed anyone male or female because my Nmother was so controlling and shaming of my body and my emotions. I've been NC with her for about two months, but I still feel like she knows everything. I still feel like I'm Not Allowed to do certain things and that, if I do, it's not *mine* to feel. I don't feel like I have agency or control over who and how I use my body.\n\nI guess my question is both how the frickin' frell do I let myself feel shit instead of disassociate all the time? And I have this guy's number but I feel like I was a complete weirdo the whole night. Is it okay to text this guy who lives 2000 miles away? And say what? \"Hey, you're great. Sorry I was strange. I have emotional trauma I'm working through. Why don't you come visit and we'll have a sex holiday\"?",

I am very happy to have found this SUB/..I hate knowing there are others out in this beautiful world that have gone through or are going through this \"black hole\" of an excuse of personality disorder. I'm actually tearing up right now typing this...I just wanted to share my similar story as of late. I met a man, gorgeous fun loving , seemingly care free..surfer guy, likes to fly, goof off.. he came into a moment in my life where i was going through some bliss and health i had not felt in a long time so we seemed to be on a level....I was preparing to move that summer and was falling in love &lt;3 so towards the end of my time in that city with him he began saying he wanted to marry me so that we could be together *we are military* so i entertained the idea but also felt in my stomach \"hey, this is something that will work or not, marriage is not the answer\" but i wanted him so terribly much and he was so overwhelmingly loving towards me giving me all of this love that I now know was \"love bombing\"\nI was at his place the night before i was heading out to my new city, and saw these messages from this girl he was with before he met me...they spoke EVERY DAY without one mention of me..or him being in a relationship...i confronted him and he acted like the victim....i dont want to get into the ridiculous conversation that followed but i expressed how hurt i was and he drank..and drank more and then it got bad he screamed at me...i thought, \"this isant the laid back care free man I love?\" it was very confusing and upsetting to me..but i needed sleep so i slept after he \"apologized\" and woke early to say a tearful good bye after he promised to never speak to her again.....fast forward 2 months of me in my new city, ecstatic ....full of wide eyed wonder and adventure..i loved it here.... he emails me saying that he'll be visiting me in a week and hints marriage again and I say \"did you fill out the paperwork I left for you at your place?\" he had not read the paperwork about marriage in my state , should have set off a red flag in more way then one, but i explained it to him...at this point im feeling excited but also a bit worried at my core and ignore it again because \"he loves me\"\nWe marry...i think, this is special we are perfect we can make it all of the things a person tells them selves when they are an optimistic fool..as i have been.\nAlmost immediately his attitude turns..180...ignores calls, when i do call he says hes \"busy\"....i can see hes going out drinking a lot...hanging out with girls...tells me I'm \"acting psycho\" begins accusing me of infidelity...questions, no, taunts me about my past sexual partners , real and made up.....i begin to believe I'm not worthy of HIM....he visits for the first time after our marriage, its been a month, i get his ring in the mail, we have a beautiful time together, i look at his phone because im checking the weather for our hike later that day and theres messages from THAT GIRL we fought over the day i left to move up here, and they have been talking and making plans from the looks of it, I was in shock...i felt completely betrayed and i am angry...i talk to him about i, he says i shouldnt go through HIS PHONE....what the hell?!! you should NOT HIDE RELATIONSHIP from your WIFE...it wasent the fact that it was that particular girl , it was that he LIED and continued a relationship lying to me about it...going behind my back..i think what else is he doing behind my back, hes in a whole different state...the visit was some what salvaged, he left on a plane, then no word from him for 2 days, im freaking out, cant sleep cant focus....i decide to fly to see him, i show up and make up....i thought, then he says can i borrow 2grand to buy this dirt bike..and i agree...idiot, then we say goodbye and things seem rocky but on the mend...more arguments....this goes on for months until i visit for a 2 week vacation, i took time off, rented a gorgeous BandB for us...its going to be a perfect time to reconnect..boy was i wrong...he drinks n says that i better not ever cheat on him several times....we make dinner on the 2nd night together and we begin talking about things that we feel like need to be discussed..and he gets furious at me for voicing concerns about women he insists on keeping in contact with..he screams..loud...and throws my loaf of banana bread i had baked at the ceiling above my head...it was scary i didnt recognize him...he didnt know it was me in the room..i begin cleaning up..he takes the broom and i walk downstairs...then I begin to worry ABOUT HIM...not the other way around which becomes more and more frequent..any argument he inists that I APOLOGIZE for..or HE WILL NOT TALK TO ME EVER AGAIN...i gave in a few times...i believed it was me a few times...then i just let him come around..he gets orders to come to my city..this is it, this will make things better...more fights, more accusations, more poking me and telling me I'm a whore, more comments like \"I dont know if its worth it\" etc...then, no contact from him..wont answer his wife on the phone..email, FB..nothing, then I get a call from someone at his unit saying that his orders were changed and he was sorry for me...so I call and text and text and am crying and panic...he finally calls says \"I changed my orders and we are getting divorced this week\" ...no explanation other than \"you don't make me happy\"\n...so i go through devastation..im completely caught off guard....weeks go by of him calling telling me I'm a whore and a terrible human being..and I should apologize...one day, i am getting healthy and i think , he must be warning me this is good, it needs to end. ... then i get a phone call, then another and another at 2 am...I was at work so didnt answer but i heard the voicemails..he was at the end of a pier ...freezing cold out and he sounds like hes crying...even then, hes saying things like , i hope you are happy with who ever it is you are seeing now...amazing how he cant be a decent human ZERO empathy..so he calls my WORK, and i take the call outside..which could potentially get me in a lot of trouble..he says he still loves me and thinks \"he made a mistake\" ..etc...i talk him into going home and getting warm and hang up say we will talk later...fast forward i tell him im willing to give it another go...IF he promises to work on himself and get mental help..he agrees etc etc...fast forward 3 months later he comes here while my best friend is in town...He acts like a spoiled brat the whole time complaining that im not paying attention to him, even though he is involved in every activity and adventure taking place, i even left my friend a lone a couple of days to be just WITH HIM and its still not adequate in his eyes..then one night at a bon fire he begins yelling at me about being in the miltary and my best friend says \"hey, lets just chill and enjoy the moment \" he turns on her, screaming \"why the f&amp;%k would you care its not YOUR LIFE!?\" btw my friend is the sweetest hippie understanding woman you could ever meet and maybe 100lbs on a good day...i tell him not to yell at her with tears in my eyes, and we leave him there to come to my apartment...he shows up grabs his phone and yells that hes going out to drink MORE...texts me over and over and i tell him to just come home and we'll talk about it when we are all sober..my bestie goes to her room , he comes home screaming, stomping around , slamming his fists on the bed next to me..i remain calm because yelling will only make things worse...thats when my neighbors begin yelling up at him, hes yelling that he will come down there and kick their ass, goes into the kitchen says \"where are you knives!?\"...this goes on for at least an hour..he has that distant look in his eyes i remember from the last freak out...it finally unwinds....oh and btw...the next day, my birthday...so I wake up on my birthday ..with him...next to me...saying hes sorry...my best friend is scared of him so i cannont have a nice day with her and my husband, instead i have to take care OF HIM. A grown ass man, so i take him to the island to hike around, all the while worried about my friend who i believe will just leave at this point...she hung around and said she was fine but damn...this is so so wrong...after all of this , if you are still reading, he begins saying he cant trust me when i take him to the airport and says we should end it...which causes me so much anxiety and confusing....i feel like im going crazy trying to keep up with this man...my best friend leaves after a nice stay, an hes on his way up to see me 2 weeks later, those 2 weeks hes love bombing and all of this..i feel like he'll be up here for 2 weeks before going to Alaska, which btw is where he decided to change his orders to in order to not be with me which i forgave and decided to try the long distance thing ....im an fool...he lasts ONE DAY up here...first day we have fun and love love love right..i go to work the next day, he emails me some random specific questions ..i ask why he asks and he says never mind , he loves me , see me after work....have a nice evening although i ask him again what he meant by the questions earlier that day...he dismisses it as unimportant...wake up go to work , he asks more questions , knowing im at work and cannot really get into any discussions because guess what, im at work....he says, 'you're gonna hate me\" and i say no..he says \" I read your diary\"....you can imagine the feeling of violation and hurt..and im at WORK...Im so patient..but this was just wrong, he says he read that i wrote someone was hot in there and hes 'Not okay with  being with me because i fantasize about men\" this becomes and 4 hour long argument while im at work.....if you are still reading, this  has been my life..and i forgave and forgave......i told him to leave, he agreed, we fought more, because I'm the one who 'doesnt understand\" who \"doesnt listen or care\"......it must really be terrible to be a N...they must be so confused and remain uneasy....its tragic...its sad because i feel sad for HIM..even after all of this..and now hes emailing me..i changed my phone number...told my boss to have his boss tell him to cease and desist emails at work...why did i love him? why..why didnt i protect my self from this...? Im going to therapy and my therapist says i dodged a bullet..but im just exhausted and still so confused as to why i wanted to be with him...even now i miss him.....life is going to be peaceful now, but i just hope he gets the message....i hope he doesnt do this to another woman..i hope he gets help.

        "text": "Hello guys \n\nAs some of you know I've been through a rough time the last few months.\n\nBullied by my manager. PTSD flare ups. Chronic stress. And then I developed Pericarditis and was bedridden in severe pain for 4 months. (Pericarditis is inflammation of the lining of the heart. Drs couldn't find any cause for mine.) \n\nI'm getting better (HOORAY!!!) I can walk short distances, do easy tasks like cooking and washing up, and don't need my wonderful SO to be my full time carer anymore. \n\nSo I got in touch with my managers to make arrangements for my return to work. I've asked 3 times to be switched to a Full Time Manager. (I'm not going to call out the bullying. I've seen how others who have done similar have been treated, and I'm not prepared to put myself through that. My manager is the only part timer, so asking for a full time manager is a sure-fire way to get moved to work with anyone but her. Plus I can use my PTSD diagnosis as the reason I need 'more support' than I had before.)  My plan was to get back to my job, with a different manager, and work out a few more months until I land another job and can leave what has become a pretty toxic workplace. (Not just my manager, but generally. In fact they've had 4 resignations in the past 2 months from my team of 18. So that gives you an idea of what the workplace and staff wellbeing is like.) \n\nBut, they've refused to move me to a Full Time manager. I have to return to work with my current manager who is definitely a Bully, and possibly an N. \n\nI am trying to fight this with support from my Dr and my Union. But the question I'm asking myself is - Is it worth it? \n\nI'm not sure I want to put myself through this very upsetting, very triggering process of trying to be treated decently and having my requests for reasonable treatment be refused by my work. \n\nI'm trying to focus on my health, and de-stress, and recover from this serous heart condition. And at the same time I'm having to negotiate this really upsetting thing over email, liaise with Occupational Health (who have been useless so far) and go to 3 (!) health assessments with their Dr.  SO is listening to all voicemails from my managers and reading their emails for me, because I find them triggering - one voicemail from my bully manager left me in a flashback for 2 days. \n\nThe question is, when do I say, enough is enough? Im not sure it is even worth putting myself through this stress for the sake of this job.  \n\nI've been looking for other jobs, and applied to one (got a warm response, but position already filled). \n\nIf I resign from my job (which I think is what my managers actually want - which is really strange cause all my appraisals have been excellent) I'm concerned it will be even harder to find another job. We can just barely live on my SOs income, and he says he'll support me to quit my job if that's what I want - life is too short to put up with this, he says. \n\nBut I'm concerned if I resign I will be swapping the stress of my bully manager for the stress of being poor and trying to find work when out of work (which is always harder!) \n\nFinally, I really want to have much less drama in my life. That's my number 1 aim. Having been raised in drama, I don't want it anymore. I'm just not sure what would be the least dramatic way to handle this situation? Continue with the toxic job until I can move on? Or quit and get the toxic out of my life but live very poor and try to get a new job in a messed up economy? (thanks Brexit) \n\nI'm asking for constructive, considered feedback please.\n\nFYI - I'm not going to take legal action or even make a complaint. I don't want to be branded a troublemaker, and I know the department well enough to know that is exactly what would happen. Also, that would be even more stressful and I already tried making an informal complaint and that was instantly squashed flat. So that is not an option.",

I was 15, and my \"presents\" were a second-hand radio, a smack upside the head and yelled at to go mow the lawn. \n\nI don't want parties.  I don't want celebrations or special meals or trips or fanfare or anything else of the sort. I have no desire to go on special trips.  He'll, I don't even care to have sex in that day! (Although I'll be expected to, because that's what she thinks I'll want and I have to keep her happy as well)\n\nIf someone wants to quietly day Happy Birthday then move along,  I could probably live with that, but they never stop there.   There are always more questions and probing into my life.\n\nIt's bad enough that all my old disordered eating habits, in both extremes, come back around this time... It would be so much easier if I could just crawl into a hole for a few days to hunker down until the storm passes.\n\nInstead, I'll not only have to be around people, but be up and around starting in the early morning for work then be up until late at night \"celebrating\" with others.\n\nFML.",

My former NBoss is states away, and no longer can control or impact my professional life. \n\nI have been extremely lucky to get away from that situation, and to now work in a place that is the polar opposite. I've been doing well, and have had a lot of positive changes. Normal feels so nice, you know?\n\nBut here lately, I find myself having flashbacks, mild panic attacks, and nightmares about my NBoss, because of the US presidential race. I know that sounds ridiculous. Heck, I even questioned it myself until someone pointed out how much I change when anything political is brought up. \n\nI know there is speculation about Donald Trump being a narcissist or sociopath. I'm not here to discuss political views or psychiatric diagnoses, but man... there are some striking similarities between Trump and my former NBoss. \n\nThey are nothing alike on the surface though! Trump is, well, Trump, former NBoss is a petite woman with an accent (born outside the US). Maybe it's the \"corporate boss\" vibe. The topics aren't the same, their mannerisms are different... it's like apples and bananas. But something about how Trump comes across to me triggers all these unpleasant feelings and memories.\n\nThe US political climate is what it is. Yet I find myself unable to watch or read anything related to the election because of how much Donald Trump reminds me of my former NBoss. A sound bite will set me off -- it's like I start hearing my NBoss' voice (and her foreign accent) instead of Trump's, and I'm taken right back to some of the worst moments from that time.\n\nI'm not sure why it's happening. I'm not sure how to deal with this, except to avoid political things -- something that isn't easy to do, given the wall-to-wall coverage right now, and it will only get worse. \n\nAny advice or tips on dealing with... flareups? relapses? would be appreciated.

I've made it clear to my mom that when I get in my \"moods\" is when I'm like that and I desperately ask her to forgive me, which she always does, but then it's hard for me to have these thoughts without buying into them.\n\nI feel like such a spoiled brat because even though some messed up shit happened, she tried (and did) her best, I tried my best, and my dad is some poor wayward soul who needs love or something. He's out of the picture now, but it's me who is doing all of the things he used to do in the house, except that I apologize when I calm down.",

I feel truely liberated and free to think for myself. I have been going to therapy just as long. For now.my therapist agrees i should stay no contact. I have a child hood friend who has added my mother months ago to social media. (Around the time i went nc) and sometimes mentions them. I try to ignore it, curiosity gets the better of me. Deep down sometimes i still think \"why cant my mother or father try and reconnect? Apologize for their wrong doings? Why do i have to be the one to get help and suffer internally? Where are their equal sufferings?\" These thoughts are few and far between now because honestly ive been working on my marriage and just not caring what they are doing in their lives.\n\nI still feel betrayed. I know i shouldnt, logically. My therapist said it was normal, especially considering i really want my parents to be... parents. If i ever have a child i will not act the way they did. My mother was uncaring. My father was/is enabler. Not just the abuse but neither of them were ever affectionate toward me. It took a few therapy sessions for me to realize that i always felt they were fake in public. Because they wanted to have a child who was successful but not actually put in the time, or love. \n\nAnyway i veered off... does anyone else feel this way? Your happy with them not in your life, couldnt really see yourself being pulled back in but sometimes feel betrayed? Maybe even just miss an occasional good time? (I do miss my father, he was always funny.) Since the nc though mom made all the effort. My dad just stepped away. Never even tried calling or texting. Hes a limp noodle when it comes to my mother i feel.",

        "text": "We just got back from vacation yesterday.  While travelling 800 miles one way (in a car) with two young children (19 months and 3.5 years) is a stress unto itself.  Being in different surroundings and dealing with different stresses made it very clear to me how bad my daily anxiety is.\n\nI have had two therapists over the last 12 (probably more) years.  Both of them have told me about my horrible anxiety.  They have told me how I suffer.  It completely went over my head.  It was so normal to me.  I couldn't see what they were talking about, because it is the air that I breathe.  My parents were abusive.  I spent 17 years being anxious every day.  I'm now 37 and I'm probably more anxious now than I was then... \n\nOver the last several weeks, I've been starting to be able to see it.  I am one of the most anxious people I know.  Anxiety colors almost everything I do.  Almost everything I do is done in certain ways to try to avoid stirring up more anxiety.  Even with everything I do to try to combat it.  Even with all the coping techniques I have learned over the learns to try to get through the day without panicking, I am still not doing well.  I'm doing better than I ever did before, but I realize I am still struggling way more than I should be.  Most of my life is built around not stirring the anxiety pot.  I can't keep living this way.  \n\nI talked to my therapist about this this morning and she brought up the dreaded psych meds.  I have been on them before.  It rarely goes well.  I am very sensitive to side effects and nine of the ten meds I have tried made me sick in various ways.  The side effects ended up being as bad or worse than my mental health problems, so I couldn't stay on them long-term.  \n\nMy therapist pointed out that short-term anxiety meds do exist.  I avoided these types of meds in the past for complex reasons I don't want to get into now.  This post is long enough as it is.  But, I will say that those reasons are no longer a concern.  If my psychiatrist is game, I'd like to try some short acting anxiety meds and see if it can help me without the insane side effects I've had with other types of anxiety meds like Effexor.  \n\nSo, right now, I'm in anxiety hell, but I'm trying to be grateful for the positive.  I know I need more help and I made an appointment.  I'll see my psychiatrist this afternoon.  It took very little for my therapist to convince me to do the right thing.  Five years ago, it probably would have taken me months of building my fortitude to manage even opening the topic for discussion.  We talked about it.  I'm doing it.  That's awesome.  I almost feel like an adult.  An adult that is horribly crippled by constant anxiety, but an adult.  \n\nPerhaps, if I am very lucky, I won't feel like my skin is on fire if I drop a wash cloth.  Because, right now, my brain thinks this is an acceptable thing to get into a panic about.  I am so very tired of myself and my bullshit.  Seeing the psychiatrist should cheer me up.  I like my doc.  He is amused by my odd ADHD ramblings and someone being amused rather than off-put by it is a real breath of fresh air.  :)  I hope he can help.\n\nUPDATE:  I have a prescription!  I guess I will test it out this weekend.  Fingers crossed that the side effects aren't awful!\n",

I'm under the thumb of a senior person who was well established when I came into the company -- and she basically blocks everything I try to do. If I do something really well, it's worse because she gets jealous of me and shoots down and belittles work that everyone else congratulates me on. \n\nSo earlier this year I started searching for a new job. At first I was getting a lot of responses and positive feedback, but now for some reason I've been getting a lot of rejection. Hiring managers say things like \"your experience isn't broad enough\" and \"you need a stronger portfolio\" whereas before I was being told my work was amazing and I had great experience. \n\nI've been racking my brain trying to figure out what's changed. How did I lose this? What happened? Is it me? And that horrible scapegoat feeling of being judged inadequate by my NMom just floods over me. \n\nRight now I feel... Horrible. Just like I'm worthless and unappreciated. I'm so amazingly frustrated right now. I want to call my NMom (who I'm VLC with) and just scream at her for making me this way. For training me to assume it's something I did wrong rather than something that can be repaired or edited. I want to scream at the world. \n\nTL:DR - I feel like a worthless shit. ",

It's not particularly bad, I'm not affected day to day but it stops me sleeping if I get the cold.\nI'm 40 years old now and I have had it as long as I can remember. But Nmum has a funny thing about asthma and allergies - she believes that \"sickly\" people (not us) have them and that nobody else can have or develop them. So - I was never taken to the doctor about any allergies or about the asthma, despite showing symptoms of both as a child.\nLast year I got very good health insurance and I made an appointment, finally, with a lung specialist who was able to confirm that I have asthma. He prescribed me a steroid inhaler to use when I have a flare up. When I have a cold, I take it 10 minutes before bed, and then I go to sleep! Before the inhaler I would cough for a up to 4 hours, I could sometimes calm my breathing enough to fall asleep sitting up, but not often and not until I was dropping from tiredness. I used to go sleep in the cellar so I wouldn't wake up the kids. Now I get a proper night's sleep.\n\nThat's not even the best thing. Do you know the best thing? The doc also asked me about allergies and I told him about the cat one and that I have hay fever and get allergic reactions to eating a whole load of fruits and nuts. And he was like \"apples? You're allergic to apples?\" and I thought, wait, I'm going to be called a fraud, aren't I? I'm going to be accused of putting this on. And he said \"great! I mean, not great, but if you're allergic to apples then it's a birch pollen allergy for sure.\" And he wrote it down. I'm diagnosed on the basis of what I said. I'm believed! It was so validating. \nJust wanted to share that!",

When I brought home perfect grade cards, according to her I was trying too hard or could only succeed academically because I was a failure in practical skills. Apparently showing perfection was wrong too. It didn't matter what it was or how well I did, the benchmark was constantly moved so that my success in her eyes was unattainable.\n\nBesides leading to a lifetime of anxiety, lack of self-confidence, and avoidance issues, from a young age I started holding other people to this same kind of impossible standard. Any little mistake of flaw in a person is magnified, and I instantly lose respect for people the second they don't meet this crazy high standard my mother imprinted in my brain.\n\nAnd I'm aware I'm doing this. And it drives me crazy and makes me feel like an absolutely horrible person. And I want to stop SO badly, but so far no therapist has been able to tackle this.

        "text": "I'm in my 50's now but knew from a child of about 4 yrs old that there was something wrong with my mother. As I got a little older I kind of figured she did not like me, or at least not as much as my GC older sister who go the best of everything. I was basically neglected, no physical abuse or screaming, but little communication and what was said was often depressing or critical.\n\nI am no contact with Nmother mostly due to a legal battle. Because I was the closest relative to her, she had legal documents arranged so that I'd have Power of Attorney if something happened. Well something did happen, due to a natural disaster my mother lost her apartment at the same time her doctor pulled her license due to Alzheimer's. My mother was in complete denial and angry about the diagnosis and extremely irate about her license. I took her in for a few weeks, it was very stressful on my family, we could not leave her alone. I found a temporary placement for her in assisted living until we could get things figured out. Her behavior was so bizarre and worrisome, the assisted living home put her into memory care. She was shadowing, having delusions, cryings spells, she wouldn't eat, etc. Some of this from the Alz and some behaviors due to mental illness which was never officially diagnosed because she refused her physicians' requests for psych care (of course!).\n\n10 days into the care home, her brother took her to the bank and had his name put on her accounts. My banker discovered this and closed her account and issued a new one. The brother was very manipulative and told her everything she wanted to hear...like she drove very well, there was nothing wrong with her, she could take care of herself and should have her own apartment (even though she could not cook, did not understand her bank statements, was misplacing and forgetting things). He was able to give her the narcissistic supple she craved. Other things happened, the police got involved and to protect her assets I tried to get conservatorship. She and her brother protested, found attorneys who thought she was mentally all there, contested the conservatorhsip and then the legal fees became too great and I had to settle. No contact since last day of court.\n\nSomething my attorney said has stuck with me, he said my mother said I was \"estranged\" and basically was not fit to be her conservator. (I have business/finacial experience and medical training) I was so caught up in the legal stress I didn't get the meaning of \"estranged\" (she dumped me?). So being NC has shown me that my mother has not liked me for years! I thought forgetting birthdays and not calling was part of the early stages of Alzheimer's but she did not forget my sister's birthday or anniversaries! And although I always thought she did not like me, it was a superficial knowing - not really accepting. Maybe your brain tries to protect you from the painful realization that you were never loved. Finally, after all these years I can see the truth. At first I was angry because my mother got to reject me (officially) before I had a chance to reject her. But now I see it so clearly and it is not painful at all, I just have a better understanding and can see things objectively. I have no regrets, even though I did not like my mother I was able to treat her with patience, kindness and respect as and adult and often as a child. More so than she was able to do for me. Although the lawsuit was one of the most painful experiences in my life, it ultimately freed me from my mother and gave me the time and distance to get a fresh perspective of our relationship and my mental health is much better.",

        "text": "Hello all, please excuse the wall of text.  And yes, I created this secondary account specifically for the purpose of posting here and in NRelationships.  \n\nI'm a 31 F who recently left my Nex after an 8 year relationship.  He is a classic N, zero empathy or insight into his own behavior, grandiose, manipulative, alternately love-bombing then gaslighting, etc, etc.  I wish I had found this community sooner, and maybe I would've identified the real problem (his narcissism and antisocial personality) and had the courage to leave earlier, but at this point I'm just grateful to know that I'm free.  And more importantly, I'm not alone in this struggle.\n\nI had tried to leave him multiple times during the many years we were together, and he would always track me down, send me flowers, call constantly, write multiple lengthy emails daily, all in an attempt to hoover me back in.  I was naive, and always caved in, even leaving other relationships to go back to him.  I always thought the 'sweet' him was the real him, and couldn't understand why once I returned that person disappeared completely.  'I know he can be good, I've seen it!' I thought.\n\nI must admit I was pretty easy to manipulate.  He came into my life at my most vulnerable point, just a year after I lost the love of my life in a car accident, and after losing that special man, I vowed to myself to never take anyone for granted ever again.  It was one of the first things I shared with the Nex when we met, not knowing that he would use this very thing against me to keep me under his thumb.  'He acted so understanding and concerned!  He must be really caring!' I assumed.\n\nIt was the typical love-bombing at first - taking me out to special places, dropping huge amounts of cash, spending every minute of his free time with me, and having long conversations and lots of sex.  There were instances when his mask would drop, though, like the first night I took him out to a friend's party and he got jealous that I was talking to my friends instead of him (even though he was not exactly social and just sat in a corner eyeing everyone with distrust) and started a huge fight.  The red flags would come up, I would try to break up and back away, and he would chase me down relentlessly until I agreed to go back to him.  'Well, he just really loves me and needs me in his life!' I told myself.\n\nThings got really bad when we moved in together.  He got a job in a city about 40 miles away from my family and friends, and as soon as I agreed to stay with him, it was as if a switch had flipped.  He treated me terribly, either ignoring me completely or berating me endlessly, picked fights with me and then called the police on me while telling me he had no respect for anyone who called the police on a loved one (I think he said this just to make me less willing to call the police when he would act out).  It was always a mindfuck with him, and he was never willing to let me keep my own job (all my male coworkers were hitting on me in his eyes), or my own friends (they're not really true friends), or even travel out to see my family except for major holidays (too expensive/time-consuming for a train ride).\n\nAnyway, I've been completely NC with the Nex for just over 5 months now, I'm in a stable environment, have a full-time job and a part-time gig, bought myself a car, got a brand new phone with a new number that he will never know, created a new primary email account, and rescued a dog from the shelter (and 'Pibble' has been a great comfort to me in just the short time I've had him, and you'll see why after reading further).  I'm very proud of how far I've come in such a short time.  BUT - I still constantly worry that the Nex will try to weasel his way back into my life again.  He hasn't tried to contact me at all so far, so he's obviously found a new narcissistic supply somewhere, but how long will that last?  It's always in the back of my mind that he will show up at my door or at my work or even sneak into my window at night, and I'm always on edge.  This situation has happened time and time again for almost the past decade of my life.  For the first few months or so, I was so anxious about it that I would have nightmares, rearranged my bedroom so that he couldn't shoot through my window and kill me in my sleep, and told my family that if I were ever to die in a suspicious way that he would be the culprit, and that they should go after him like the Browns and Goldburgs went after O.J.  It sucks to live that way, and it sucks that he still has that kind of control over my happiness and peace.\n\nAnd there is one way he could get back into my life, and I'm pretty sure he knows it - the dog he bought to manipulate me.  Let's call her Darling.  Two years before this final break-up, I had broken up with him and was staying out at my parents house, and he went out and bought a puppy.  He knew I'd been wanting to rescue a dog for a while, and I believe he did this as a way to sucker me back in.  And boy did it work like a charm.  It kept me hanging around for another two years before a situation involving his schitzophrenic mother (which is long story for another post) ended our relationship for good.  Anyway, I raised Darling from 8 weeks old, taught her how to sit and wait for her food from the second day we got her, taught her all her manners and tricks, made sure she had enough exercise and stayed healthy, and loved her like she was my child.  When I knew I would be leaving, I tried to think of any way possible that I could bring her with me, but Nex bought her, and in the eyes of the law, Darling is his property - even though I raised her, cared for her, and was her whole world.  He wouldn't let me have her, and I couldn't take her with me without putting myself in a worse place, so I had to leave her behind with that psycho.  And the only thing that would compel me to ever speak to him again is if he called and said that he couldn't take care of Darling and would give her to me.  I worry about her every day - is she getting proper vet care, enough food, exercise, attention, and love?  Probably not, and there's nothing I can do about it.  It sucks so bad that I can't even go and see her to make sure he is taking care of her properly.  \n\nSo, ranting aside, what should I do if the Nex tries to manipulate me with Darling again?  I do want to see her, but seeing her means seeing him, and that's just gonna cause more trouble.  The problem is, I don't think I could stop myself if he used her as bait, because I love her so much and worry about her constantly.  Even though I have my own dog now (Pibble) that I also love to pieces, Darling is still always on my mind.  Any advice on how to stay strong in my NC with Nex even if he used the 'Darling card' would be greatly appreciated.\n\nTL;DR - Been NC with Nex for 5 mos. after 8 yr. relationship but worried that he will use the dog he bought to manipulate me to sucker me back into contact again.\n",

        "text": "I just moved out and as such am without a therapist or guidance on this manner.  I haven't been diagnosed with ptsd and I don't know the proper definition of the word trigger but I feel it is appropriate for this context. Please let me know if I am wrong.  I don't even feel good about using the word trigger or using a trigger warning on this post.  \n\n\nSome of the things that get to me are mostly scents that you will come in contact with everyday.  Namely cigarette smoke and coffee.  My Ndad was a voracious user of both along with drugs and now the scent absolutely suffocates me.  I can't breath, I gag, and I start getting intrusive thoughts and memories.  After my Ndad died and I found him I literally could not get the mix of those scents and death out of my head to the point I was carrying around perfume soaked napkins as an attempt to ward it away.  My hands feel disgusting again where I felt for a pulse and I start getting the urge to wash them multiple times and have done so.  Even just thinking about it now makes me want to douse them in bleach water even though I know it won't help.\n\n\nRoasted marshmellows is another big one.  For most people its a great reminder of summer but for me it just smells like pills being burned, the primary way my Nmom would use them.  I used to love that scent as a kid but now I get disgusted at it and start holding my breath even when I am actually roasting marshmellows.  I can't eat smores it makes me feel so sick to my stomach. I start getting spaced out and kind of numb thinking about it and it is really hard to get off that track.\n\n\nOld people.  Or really just old people arms is what gets to me when their arms have huge veins, bruises and cuts (meth head arms).  I literally see my Ndad like superimposed on their face.  I start to disassociate if you can call it that (I go on autopilot and space out almost like I am out of my body but like still inside kind of like I am watching from just behind my face.).  I haven't told anyone about this one especially since my SO's dad has cancer and for now has those trade mark old people arms courtesy of low blood platelets.  I had to stop myself from crying and running to the bathroom once I noticed.  It's fortunate he is on the tail end of treatment so I won't be around him till he is healed.  It just really makes me uncomfortable.\n\n\nMy point to all of this is how do I cope with these when I can't simply avoid these mostly pleasant smells.  It is really ridiculous to ask someone not to drink their coffee too close to me or to tell someone to cover their arms up or even just to avoid sitting at a campfire because I know someone will want smores.  I really would like to drink coffee again without it being associated with death and drugs and the same for roasted marshmallows.   I know I am safe now and don't have to think or worry about these things if I don't want to but they just keep popping up and now that I am out I keep finding more little things that just set off a torrent of nightmares and I don't know what to do.

Why did I even look at his page? \n\nNone of it is true. He hasn't even attempted to \"have a say in the matter\" - simply because he can't find a job. He's failed at his career and blames me for it so he doesn't have to take responsibility.\n\nI don't know. Time has past, lots of time, and I thought I have come to grips with it. But this blatant lie that he likely will also tell our child still hurts me some place deep down. \nIt makes it ever more clear that he'll use that as a narrative for his life, for why he now has to leave the career he loves so much. It's easier than accepting to have failed at his career.\n\nHe takes my firm stance on prioritising the childs' wellbeing over me actively promoting his career (at the cost of mine) as me constraining him in his career development, and life happiness. It's my fault he has a bad life. \n\nI'm so angry.\n\nIn my head, I've formulated a felt hundred answers to this on social media. Answers that range from loosing it to pettiness to classy to subtle irony. I've refrained from commenting nonetheless. I will not engage in such petty interactions. I will not mention it when we see each other again. \nAlso, more general, I will not engage the child in a discussion about this. I will not speak about it until he's an adult, and also then only if he asks. \n\nBut boy am I tempted. \n\n\n  \n",

I was super depressed w bad ptsd symptoms. I tried selling clothes/old bags and stuff just to buy shampoo. I was on food stamps while looking for a full time job. It was a struggle and I worked 2 jobs with ample baggage. I was about to be hired on full time and got let go after things looked like they were getting better. I found a retail job (which turned out to be toxic and did nothing for my self-esteem esp w a degree) and was soon hospitalized for my depression. Despite everything, I quit the job and found a temp job less than a week later. At first I liked it even though it isn't quite what I want to do, but it got worse as I found out my boss is a closet bully who doesn't always do her work. My bf  of 2 years who helped me out has had unresolved anger and I am starting to wonder if it's borderline related after researching. idk. Anyway, I am trying to find work I love and get a mode of transportation but it isn't working out. I love my bf, and I have fleas so ik can be difficult (im in therapy no worries) but working stuff out w him goes in circles and idk what to do. I feel trapped. How can I get out of this rut? and how did people here figure out what they really wanted to do/ find a good career? ",

        "text": "I was the scapegoat. Not anymore however, as I no longer interact with my family. Any of my family (all three of them, not counting a niece I don't know and my sister’s husband who doesn't know just how deep in over his head he is. That dumb fuck little henchman has nothing and he doesn’t even know it.).\n\nThe issue at hand is this emotional vacillation between feeling neutral and feeling really annoyed with them.  Annoyed to the point that I want to dial them on the phone and tell each of them how crappy I think they are.  But alas, we all know that confrontation is but a fools errand when a raging piece of shit Narcissist is involved.  Though… in a sense, it would be the ultimate gift to my family.  The frantic excitement of such a brazen and unguarded display of emotion.  It would truly be a feeding frenzy.\n\nBut I am not a martyr for the sake of entertainment at the expense my own emotional wellbeing. My days of martyrdom are over.\n\nTen years ago I donated a kidney.  Ten years ago my sister sat in the waiting room, waiting with my boyfriend and best friend, for me to get out of a six hour surgery.  And with me out of the room and the open and willing ears of my two closest friends, she couldn't help herself: \"*siiigh* well, after this is over, *I HOPE* The_Toot_Jerry finally gets their life together.\" She started. But thank god for friends, because I learned that was not where it ended. And they were pretty dumbfounded that such a conversation could occur in that context.  I was 22 at the time, depressed, lost, but working and living at home helping my parents pay the bills that they could not afford (so I thought) without my help.  I was also quite the punching bag, my father berating me up until the final night before we went in for his life saving surgery.  \n\nSo, after that fucking day, I *actually did* get my fucking life together. Just not in the “acceptable way” outlined by my family. No, I didn't work full time, paying for college quarter to quarter while living at home like I was told \"good\" people do (and they do when they have a support system, as opposed with the hyenas I was working with). Instead, I fucking moved in with that amazing man and then retreated into crippling fucking depression.  Because depression was the safe mode which kept my rage from destroying what little life I was able to squirrel aside for myself.  And it was at that point that my relationship was labeled “sugar daddy” because I worked retail and he worked IT.  Ongoing emotional punishment I assume, for not following the “accepted” path.\n\nSo, here I am.  Fighting to come out of emotional hibernation from this winter of god damn fucking hate which has burned so bright inside me… a deep and sincere vitriol one can only feel for family.  And it is only just recently, that I have begun to get it under control, and little by little, come out of my shell.  But as I come out of my shell, the same old feelings bubble and boil, causing me to grit my teeth at inappropriate times.  So instead of feeding my percolating desire to tell each and every one of them why they are dead to me, I've come here. Once again. To write out my thoughts. Because I do not want to degrade myself one minute more by letting those pieces of shit know a single god damn thought in my head.\n\nI know that one or two of you will come across this and understand. Understand the anger, and just what a trap it is.  And how it festers and boils.  And just, how-much-fucking-work it is, to contain and heal after the confusion and chaos of being told who and what you are by people who care only about their own reflection in the mirror.\n\nEdited: formatting ",
