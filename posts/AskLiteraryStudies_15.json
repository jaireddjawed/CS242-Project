And Herman Basket told how Doom took a puppy out of the box in which something was alive, and how he made a bullet of bread and a pinch of the salt in the gold box, and put the bullet into the puppy and the puppy died.\n\n I'm afraid I'm rather lost.

        "text": "It seems to me that poetry is often called 'fiction'. And certainly that's true when the poem is clearly about characters: The Odyssey, Beowulf, Lewis Carroll's 'Jabberwocky', etc.\n\nBut there are some poems which describe real-world events and experiences. From Sappho to Wordsworth to Robert Frost, poets have written autobiographically about their lives about about how they feel. They could have written in the form of a prose diary, and if they had we'd call that non-fiction, but they chose to write within metrical forms in that strangely condensed sort of writing we call poetry. Does the fact Seamus Heaney's experiences are written in quatrains make them something other than 'non-fiction'? You might argue that it's the constant use of figurative language that puts a poem like District and Circle outside the realm of 'non-fiction', but yet we still call the - equally metaphorical - journalistic prose of Dickens 'non-fiction'. It seems as soon as it's in verse, we hesitate to call a piece of writing 'non-fiction'.\n\nPerhaps with some poems we must call them fiction as it is ambiguous whether the speaker is the voice of the poet or the voice of a character. But there are many poems where it is clear that the \"I\" in the poem is the speaker. And there are also many poems without a voice at all: poems that describe an aspect of the natural world, or form a polemic against a political system. These poems, surely, are closer to non-fiction than fiction. In fact, now that I think about it, there must be many more poems that we could more comfortably call works of 'non-fiction' than works of 'fiction'.\n\nIs there something I'm missing here?",

Ninefingers goes into a rage and destroys everyone or thing around him.  He has no control over himself, attacking friend and foe alike.\n\nI think The Hulk might be a good example too.\n\nWhen I was reading about Ninefingers I thought to myself \"this sounds like a RPG/dungeons and dragons berserker.\" I've never played the game but that DnD class had to be based on SOMETHING. When I tried to Google for the origins of this trope, a lot of examples came up, but most were basically: \"I've had enough of your shit, so I'm gonna smack you\" or \"I'll not be a victim again\".

I enjoy pretty much all of the subjects and I bet I will even more in the second year as there will be less obligatory subjects and more room for the students to build their schedule from a wide variety of different subjects ranging from literary theory, philosophy to phonetics and English didactics.\n\nMy question is, perhaps if someone had a similar experience, that at some point I will have to choose a \"specialization\", meaning going either for critical and cultural theory (which I'm not particularly interested in studying anymore), US/EN/IR literature or lingustics with a focus on teaching English. \n\nTo be honest, what I enjoy the most is literature and talking about it in class, and I'm not that big on linguistics. On the other hand, I've recently started realizing that while literary theory is quite appealing to me and it inspires me, I am also faced with the option to become a well-studied English teacher, which although is something I have zero experience in, it is something I believe I would enjoy doing. I'm now stuck in this dilemma whether pick a naive specialization and work shitty jobs, or actually learn legitimately applicable skills that could eventually help me sustain myself. \n\nI'm not too big on manual work, as I believe many here are, I prefer working with my head. I feel that if I focused on literary theory, I would enjoy university more, but my overall happiness would suffer as some years later I may find myself in a sticky scenario of having studied something of no particular use in the \"real world\". Another aspect of this whole thing is that I'm Czech and live in Prague and there's a huge market for (quality) English teachers, and I also do believe I would be well marketable abroad as well, which I find quite appealing as traveling for work and being to sustain myself from said work to keep the whole thing going is something I would greatly enjoy.\n\ntldr, stuck between focusing on English didactics which may prove a useful skill throughout my life and environment, or focus on literary theory which I may ultimately find useless no matter how interesting it is. \n\nI also want to mention I don't really want to work as an academic.\n\nThanks and have a nice day!",

Of course, I did my share of observing modernism and contemporary arts, with an emphasis on literary theory, but although I've read a lot of works, I honestly rarely felt that any author except Harold Bloom or Northrop Frye observes art in the same way as I do. So that's why, even when I am in an opportunity to seriously discuss literature, I find myself being a part of some elitist dinosaur minority in contrast with the general consensuses about arts.\n\nBut that's not to say I'm close-minded, as I really want to see something meaningful in vast torrents of contemporary literary criticism being produced today still. And that's where discussions come in, I guess.\n\nWhat has always interested me the most is the nature, essence, meaning of art, its point, and its role in the society - I specify literature because that's what I studied the most, finding it to be seminal in a way. The work which has always bothered me the most is Adorno's Aesthetic Theory, which I'd love to discuss with someone who actually appreciates or agrees with it (or with basically any other of Adorno's writings regarding arts and culture).\n\nI'd love to find someone keen on keeping a continuous streak of lengthy discussions regarding literature and arts, spanning days or weeks even, but, of course, with any required pauses between correspondences as to allow for long, but well argumented and substantial messages.

        "text": "tl;dr I am looking for a recommendation. I like books with lots of symbolism and foreshadowing. I loved 3 stories growing up, I forget what it was, but it was a dark story of someones life through the holocaust. There was another story (again sorry this was back in middle/high school and I forgot, about 10 years ago) who's name I forgot again, which dealt with the life of a kid who lived his life with an alcoholic and very abusive mother who practically tortured him. I enjoyed that story a lot. The last story I enjoyed and one that stuck with me as my all time favorite book was a book called \"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry\" which had a lot of foreshadowing, themes, and symbolism. It dealt with a black family in the country side of a country, and what their life was like growing up through the great depression and discrimination. Right now I am currently looking for a short story book.\n\nI want to improve my ability to read and focus on texts. Mainly for college as I have a hard time reading my text book.\n\nI am looking for some interesting books to read, preferably short. Currently, whenever I try to read a book I just lose focus or don't retain it so I am going to start with something short...recently I tried reading a short story, maybe a page long and I just ended up falling asleep so thats why I prefer short stories at the moment, I don't have the focus built up yet.\n\nAnyways, I love two three types of books. Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry, any really dark themed books, like dealing with the holocaust, or a story about a child who has to live her life with an abusive mother/father. I really love stories dark like that because it brings out the feels.\n\nI love books with symbolism and foreshadowing, I love reading books where I can be like \"hmm this book is foreshadowing this or that lets see if im right...\" or when a book has symbols or little meanings here or there.\n\nRoll of thunder, Hear my cry had a lot of foreshadowing in it which I enjoyed.\n\nI was really into reading books the school gave us until about 10th grade where I found it getting a bit boring and thats when I stopped reading books and noticed my readability going down. But I loved looking at things in my own life because I would critically thing about books like I did with my own life or when ever I tried to predicate my own future I would look at things and call it \"foreshadows\" in my life...maybe its different since I am much older and more mature but just wanted to share lol",

To expand on this my main gripe is trying to figure out how/why they challenge authorial intent in their own framework and how they are different from one another .\n\n For Derrida Words are not objective and the things those words represent  do not exist in some transcendental plane so we can never know what an author means. Words and language are not precise so they cannot be a one to one representation of the world. Since we all view the relation between signified and signifier slightly differently due to cultural , emotional , psychological , etc factors , literature is thereby malleable , because our language is malleable . For example culturally in the west generally the color red is associated with anger , blood , and generally holds a negative connotation as it relates itself to other signifiers , but in China red is seen as a color that represents good luck so your cultural conditioning / experiences change the landscape of the text you are reading .\n\nSo how is this any different from Barthes ? I understand that Derridas project was to undermine binary oppositions and to show how they are arbitrary and that there really is nothing inherent about our language that \"chooses\" which word in a binary pair is favored . But ultimately in terms of literary analysis don't Derrida and Barthes reach the same conclusion on authorial intent ?\n\nWhat is the line in the sand that separates Derridas deconstruction and Barthes Death of an Author ?\n\nThanks !",

The conference comes first, chronologically. It takes place at Oxford but is not totally connected to the school, to my understanding. Anyway, it would be safest to submit there, and then if I get rejected, to submit to the semiotics journal. However, I'm not sure how rare an opportunity publishing in a journal is compared to a conference collection. Any advice? Thanks!",

Setting aside all of the discussions that may arise from the nature of this request, however, seems a good way to start.\n\nEdgar Allan Poe, whose mastery of style and composition held such an effect over his readers that later on the likes of Agatha Christie, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Howard Phillips Lovecraft, and Stephen King would draw inspiration from his works, can almost be thought of to be like the lone domino that topples two dominoes which topple three, and so on, in a fan-like arrangement depicting the development of literature up to today's.\n\nI am not a literary scholar. But inasmuch as that Poe's influence can be likened unto a domino toppling other dominoes, the true history of the genres we recognize today is more or less just an author influencing another. Stories however, when plotted against the march of time, do not arrange themselves as if in the midst of a diaspora like I am making it out to be right now.\n\nLiterary history is more like a parade of authors, set on a staff that changes its musical scale as the world turns, with genres but repeating themes - similar, but hardly ever the same notes twice.\n\nMy request is this - if we set Poe to be in an arbitrary center and ran down both ends of this parade, who will we see behind him and who will we see in front? We could set the likes of Plato, Aristotle, and Cicero to be a backwards limit and whatever's trending now to be a forwards limit.\n\nIf I want to read everything that is prominent starting from the roots of the literary tree, (which can be argued to be hardly a tree at all), where do I start and how do I get to the top?",

        "text": "I never studied literature, except I took a 19th Century Russian Literature class back in college. (So I'm a complete layman). I read literature quite often though. I remember my professor in this class said there are no \"spoilers\" in literature. She meant that literary works can be enjoyed even with spoilers. In fact, she explained the whole plot *Anna Karenina* and spoiled its ending, and said you can still appreciate the book. It made sense to me back then.\n\nI've been thinking about it today which made me skeptical. For example, the author of *The Kreutzer Sonata* announces that Pozdnyshev murdered his wife in the beginning of the story. But Dostoevsky uses suspense as a very important device in *Crime and Punishment*, and he does it very well. Edgar Allan Poe, in *The Tell-Tale Heart* announces the deed of the main character in a way the reader gets convinced that he'll do it. But in *The Murders in the Rue Morgue*, everything kind of builds up to the surprise ending, and author writes according to this. Kafka's *Trial*, for example -- would it be the same if it was announced in page 1 that K. will die like a dog? Also, what about *Waiting for Godot*, it seems like the author found a certain way to tell the story such that we all know Godot will never come, but there is still margin of doubt. What if he comes?\n\nIt seems like the reader not knowing the ending is one of the driving forces of how writers write, and how literary works can be analyzed. So, my question is, can literature be spoiled?",
