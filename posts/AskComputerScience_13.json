Although I did have some math in my IT minor, I forgot about 50% of it and the Computer Science undergrads had a lot more math than I did. I also didn't have any physics courses. My programming abilities, are, I'd say, average at best - I can implement a linked list or some sorting algorithm, but I tend to have more bugs with algorithms like quicksort or mergesort. Also, if I have to do a backtracking algorithm or something with graphs on a complex graph data structure, I get a bit lost (that is, I need some time to figure it out). While I know that an average computer science student probably forgot most of what he had learned (if he didn't review periodically) and he didn't learn as comprehensively as the curriculum planed for him to learn, he probably heard more concepts than me and has that moment of recollection when someone mentions something he heard on a lecture or read about in a book.\n\nSo I decided to use this summer time to prepare. I see two possible strategies:\n\n - prepare in advance for the upcoming classes by reading the literature related to those classes (classes like Machine Learning, Pattern Recognition etc.)\n - focus on filling in the gaps in my existing knowledge as much as possible\n\nI decided for the option 2 (that is, \"focus on filling in the gaps in my existing knowledge as much as possible\"). I decided to focus on math and programming, alongside getting used to Linux and reviewing computer networks, operating systems and computer architecture and putting all of the aforementioned topics in my Spaced Repetition System (Anki). My summer curricula is below. It is based on books, since I will be self-studying. I calculated that for each category I need about 16 hours per week (approximately), since this is usually the time \"burden\" courses require from students.\n\n**Calculus:**\n\n - read and solve exercises from *Calculus: Early Transcedentals* by *Stewart*; if I need to, brush up on some precalculus concepts (but there's no need to read the whole precalculus book if I only don't know how to complete the square, for example)\n\n**Algorithms:**\n\n - read and solve exercises from *The Algorithm Design Manual* by *Skiena*; if that is too complicated, then read the same algorithm explanation in *Grokking Algorithms*\n\n**Other computer science related things:**\n\n - install and learn how to use Linux\n - review computer networks \n - review operating systems\n\nI plan to work 7 hours on workdays (1 hour is my lunch hour) + some small amount of hours each weekend (3-4 hours). It would all amount to 40-45 hours a week. So that's a *minimum* which will *constantly be exectuded*. I know that hours don't gurantee success, but I want to make sure I am investing the required time.\n\nAs I'm writing this now, a part of me wants to maniacally study everything under the sun I'm interested in - calculus, linear algebra, probability, physics, biology, statistics, algortihms etc. But I know that if you try to do too many things at once you don't do any of them well. And besides, I'd also like to have some days where I spend time with family, physically exercise or go out. I could structure my summer routine so that I encompass everything I'm interested in, but I believe that this tactic (of selecting only a few items) is better. In the best-case scenario, if I do indeed finish with studying these topics before the start of my new semester, I can just add in a new topic I'm interested in in place of the old one.\n\nSome questions for you:\n\n - do you think it is better to spend this summer reviewing and learning the fundamentals or is it better to read the literature I'll have in the upcoming courses in advance?\n - do you think I choose the most important topics as the \"fundamentals\"? (if you think that 2nd approach is the better approach)\n - do you think that this approach (focusing on a few things, then if I learn them substituting them with new things) is better than trying to learn all the things I'm interested in at once (and then devoting smaller time chunks to those things)?\n - any other tips you'd have?\n\nI think that a good plan is important to have, but it is worth nothing if it is not executed upon. So leave your remarks so I can start executing as fast as possible!\n\nThanks in advance!",

In Korea, there have been no effective communication between teachers and students, and they continue to drive lectures on lectures from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm. I'm the students who follow this lectures faithfully. Every teachers tell me 'you are a very hard worker'. But the result was not good as expected. \n\nWith disappointment, I have found some papers about psychology and cognitive-science. And this picture tell me why it had to be failed. After I found this picture, I avoids lecture-oriented courses intentionally. \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/mvg1hr02kk811.png\n\n  But there were lectures on the Internet that changed that perception. On youtube,  some videos explain computer science knowledge with cognitive friendly features. These videos do not have  format just the lecturer who comes out and writes on the white board. But the ones seem to enhance the lecture's effectiveness with dynamic visual effects.

In the book Robert mentions that functions should be as simple as possible and have clear intent, which makes sense, however in the example below I had some concerns with the way he re-factored this code that generates prime numbers.\n\nThe issue that I essentially have is that he pulled the crossedOut array from the generatePrimes function into a static class member. This array is then populated by the called functions instead of being passed back and forth from the calling generatePrimes function. My concern with this as I see it is that it's not clear where the variable is coming from/how it changes, at least in my eyes as the flow isn't confined to just the function call hierarchy but to the class as well. I understand this has the benefit of simplifying the function call structure but I don't know it just doesn't feel right.\n\nAm I wrong? I want to try and do what's considered best practice and readable but this structure seems more confusing then simply adding aditional arguments to the function calls.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/phy23bi8f7811.jpg",

There is one line that is giving me a bit of trouble:\n\n    [q,f_dummy,exitflag, output] = quadprog(H,f,-A,zeros(p*N,1),E,qm,[],[],q0,options); \n\nI looked up the documentation in MATLAB to find that the quadprog function is used for optimization (particularly minimization).\n\nI attempted to find a similar function in Python (using numpy) and there does not seem to be any. At this point I am a little stumped on how to proceed and write the code in Python.\n\nIs there a better way to translate this line of code into Python? Is there a way to even directly translate this line? Or are there other packages that can be used? Do I need to make a new function that accomplishes the same task?\n\nThanks for your time and help!",

(I also thoroughly regret my BS MET despite the limited opportunities it has afforded me).\n\nA dear friend of mine is a Stanford Alumni who advised me to consider that by the time I'd have my Master's in Computer Science that I'd be 35-36-ish. His experience has been that despite having a light background in CS that my experience as an engineer would still count and I'd be pushed towards management (something I do **not** want to become). I cherish being a nerd and am more obsessed with being a practitioner over losing out on technical expertise to manage people...\n\nI'm curious to hear feedback.\n\nI'm fascinated by A.I. and the little I've studied it I find I can actually understand it (of course, only roughly), however software engineering is of interests to me as well. Between the two, seeing as I will be in my mid-thirties shifting into the CS field, which should I consider based on the everyone's experience? Does my friend have a good point? Or is he over exaggerating? Any other thoughts and suggestions are warmly welcomed.\n\nBest,\n\nScott",

I'm always trying to avoid using loops inside loops filled with if statements, and often I approach a problem being like \"is this really the best way?\" before staring at it for like an hour, sometimes finding a better way.

        "text": "Hi folks.\n\nSo, I'm learning how to properly make software documentation using UML. I've figured out that sequence diagrams can be used to show the exchanged messages (methods) between two objects. My main concern is, is it bad practice to leave out some \"less important\" messages? In my case, my code is full of if-cases with exceptions being thrown. It'd be really really boring to include a combined fragment with an exception throw every 3 messages, so, can I just abstract from this aspect?  \nI feel like it's kinda important, but then again, the purpose of modeling is to abstract, isn't it?  \nThanks!",
