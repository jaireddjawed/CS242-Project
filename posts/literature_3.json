        "text": "Over the time that I've been trying to catch up on classical literature, I've noticed that a lot of the books that people say are the greatest of all time, *The Brothers Karamazov*, *East of Eden*, *To Kill a Mockingbird*, *Dune.* None of these books are novels that I'd consider to be on the top of the list of the classics that I've read.\n\nHowever, the classics that I have loved, *Anna Karenina, War &amp; Peace, Moby Dick, Les Miserables, Gravity's Rainbow,*  are books that are criticized for being pretentious, or requiring too much for the reader, or are simply too unrelatable or bogged down in useless details. That the only way you can get something out of them is through being some pretentious English grad student, whereas many of the books I mentioned prior are praised for having deep stories and themes, that speak to being human.\n\nYet, for some reason I like the latter classics, the ones that are very unpopular more than the classics above. \n\nIt's driving me crazy, because I can't give some overly deep analysis as to why those classical novels I really liked are good, but I had an insanely fun time reading them and was wowed by the prose. But then again, I'm not a professional writer, I can't explain why the writing is so good, I just noticed that it is. \n\nLike what is wrong with me as a reader that my literary opinions align with literary snobs over actual, breathing people",

        "text": "Next is Mona Simpson’s “Lawns” (1986). The protagonist, Jenny, is a gifted college freshman with a penchant for stealing. Specifically, she steals mail that her classmates receive at her job in the dormitory mailroom. She targets the mail of the well adjusted kids from her high school - she wants to know more about the inner workings of their lives. She is dating one of these kids - Glenn - and by association, has become one of the crowd that she could only watch from afar in high school. \n\nAs the story progresses, the reader finds out that Jenny is actively being sexually abused by her father - a dynamic that has existed since she was 8 years old. Jenny steals the mail not only to fill a void in her life from the trauma, but to gain a sense of control. She also likes to see what she can get away with - a feeling she sensed from her father the first time he raped her. \n\nJenny has a contemptuous relationship with her mother that isn’t fleshed out until we understand that her mother’s dedication to her career as a lawyer led to an absence that allowed for the abuse to go on. \n\nThroughout the story, men are characterized as weak; Jenny’s father has deluded himself into believing that they are in love and will end up together, Glenn is unable to support Jenny once she reveals the truth about her past and ends their relationship, even a university cop who briefly interrogates Jenny about the missing mail fails to get her to break. \n\nIt’s the women of the story who consistently show strength: Jenny tells her mother about the abuse and tells her father that she will not continue their “relationship”, her mother immediately kicks her father out of the house and goes about finding Jenny support, and Jenny’s roommate and best friend stands by her in the break up with Glenn and helps her to realize that she is not to blame for the abuse. \n\nQuotable: “I felt the same as I always used to, like I loved him and all that, but he might just be one of those things that you can’t have. Like I should have been for my father, and look at him now. Oh, i think he’s better, they’re all better, but I’m gone, they’ll never have me again”.",

I think this is partly due to the fact I read modern sci-fi / fantasy for the plot and action which typically isn’t the purpose of the classics. I am totally new to this and I hope this is the right sub for my question. \n\nI recently saw that War and Peace by Tolstoy is considered one of the greatest novels ever written, and saw comments on how it was incredibly thought provoking/perspective altering and I’d like to give it a go. \n\nWhat would you all suggest as some good entry level classics that fit the following criteria:\n\n1) Reasonably Short: just to keep the attention engaged as I start out. \n\n2) Is thought provoking: I would like to read something that makes me either question my current perspective or something that is eye opening and gives an insight into something you wouldn’t typically consider. \n\n3) Is in a traditional novel format: Currently not looking to start with anything like Shakespeare (plays), poetry or books by the old world philosophers. \n\nFor what it’s worth, I’m a male in my late 20s if that would impact recommendations.  \n\nThanks!",

I'm doing my Master's in translation (German/English/French) and I chose the topic of machine translation in literary translation for my thesis. However, the task of finding English short stories that have been translated into German (and possibly went through traditional publishing) has been more taxing than I had initially expected.\n\nAt first I wanted to do Sherlock Holmes short stories but my professor told me to look for something more recent. Of course I have found a lot of \"recent\" (2020s) short stories but there are hardly ever any German translations of them. I do not want to compare entire novels as it would be quite overkill for my analysis (and readability survey).   \n\n\nThat's where I need your help. I'm looking for short stories published from ca. 2000-2023 with German translations. I don't want to translate a short story myself as that would influence my findings. I would appreciate any input really, as my professor probably would find most literature from the 20th century too \"old\" for the purpose of my thesis. Names of \"modern\" authors that have published short story collections would also be helpful.   \n\n\nThank you for your input and help in advance!\n\nFlaired \"Discussion\", because I don't know which category would really fit my request...  \n\n\nTLDR: I'm looking for short stories published in 2000s at the earliest with German translations for my thesis. Any input is very welcome.",

The middle class Schlegels are these intermediaries between the classes who seem to end up bruised by their associations with either side.\n\nIs the lesson we're supposed to learn that the rich and the poor need to stay away from each other and not be involved in each other's lives even as an act of charity?\n\nThat if you're working class you shouldn't aspire to any kind of intellectual satisfaction? That you will be literally crushed by your desire for knowledge?\n\nIs Howards End just the English Great Gatsby? Or I suppose as Howards End was published first is The Great Gatsby the American Howards End?",

        "text": "On one side, I feel what I am asking is *stupid –* who cares? just chill out and enjoy the books for what they are; but on the other, I really want to pull out as much as I can from books, and I'm looking for tips and advice on how best to do that.\n\nPeople who have studied literature (or any subject similar, such as philosophy) will have been taught how to analyse text and will have more context when going into new books (i.e. a more \"in-depth\", relatively speaking, understanding of common tropes, literary techniques, and so on). And having spent time writing about literature, studying it, etc., they'll be able to pick up on things much easier. And also, being in an environment where they're surrounded by likeminded people (such as at university), these people will be taking part in discussion about literature on a regular basis. All this is something I lack, and thus makes it harder for me to properly get out of books as much as I'd like.\n\nIt's not like I don't see anything in literature; in fact, I see a lot in books, more so than I thought I would have, which is what has made me fall in love with them. Books like *Brave New World, Notes from Underground, The Picture of Dorian Gray* – these books have left such huge impressions on me.\n\nAfter recently finishing *Crime and Punishment* (now one of my favourites books, without a shadow of a doubt), I looked online for some analyse, and I simply could not believe some of the interpretations and impressions I was hearing – not a chance would I have pulled such information from the books on my own. And this has essentially left me slightly anxious at my *lack of knowledge* (but in a positive way; in a way where it leads me to writing these sorts of posts in order to *learn* more).\n\nWhat advice could you give to someone who essentially *wished* to have studied literature at university; someone who wants to pick up as much from literature, be able understand and analyse and develop a taste in the art; but who doesn't have the same breadth of resources as someone who has?\n\nAre there any resources? Do people track what they are reading and write down their thoughts? Is there a place where I can learn some of the things people learn in university?\n\nI don't know if any of this sounds naive. It's a new passion of my now, it seems, and I'm just excited. Any advice is much appreciated, even if you think it might not what I'm asking for.",

        "text": "I've been out of high school for almost two decades and I may have had an epiphany about a book that I have held up as an example of how not to write a book: Moby Dick. I don't think this is so much a spoiler as something that should be blatantly obvious. I just didn't realize. \n\nI started reading, for Junior Honors English, the most nauseatingly overwritten work of fiction I had attempted to slog through reading back to front: Moby Dick. So much so that I hold this book and Herman Melville as exactly what anti-intellectuals hate about intellectuals. I've used the term \"time vampire\".\n\nThis brings me to trolling and my question. I have seethed over this book until writing about it today when I realized Melville wrote this way on purpose. You're supposed to get bored with slogging through the appendix, to punish the reader, put in the middle of the book rather than at the back of it with references in footnotes. You're supposed to skip the chapters that take entire chapters, which Melville should condense to single line or paragraph summaries. \n\nFrom Wikipedia,\n\n&gt;Emphasizing subjective intuition over objective empiricism, its adherents believe that individuals are capable of generating completely original insights with little attention and deference to past masters. It arose as a reaction, to protest against the general state of intellectualism and spirituality at the time.\n\n[Link to quote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendentalism#:~:text=Emphasizing%20subjective%20intuition,at%20the%20time).\n\nAm I right? Or am I just so embittered by this book that I may have come around to giving it credit it doesn't deserve? Was Melville and my teacher trolling me?",

        "text": "About two years ago, I read a book and I was amazed (Greek book, title translation: \"The hero of Gant\", there should be a French translation).\n\nFor some reason I started thinking about it a few days ago.\n\nI didn't know how to describe it, I could not find the words and put them together. After some googling around, I found an article that described some things very well (google translation follows):\n\n\"*The central motifs of Kakhtitsis, the* ***emphasis on memory****, the* ***inner workings of thought****,* ***blurring the line between fantasy and reality****, the subject's problematic relationship with the world, the* ***alternations of consciousness*** *are at the same time the main themes elaborated by the European and the Latin American literature at the turn of the 20th century*\" ([https://www.kathimerini.gr/culture/421755/o-nikos-kachtitsis-kai-o-iroas-tis-gandis-pernoyn-ston-kanada/](https://www.kathimerini.gr/culture/421755/o-nikos-kachtitsis-kai-o-iroas-tis-gandis-pernoyn-ston-kanada/))\n\nI would also explicitly add that the **author is not reliable** (implied by the emphasis on memory but I think it should be mentioned again).\n\nSo, since I am completely ignorant, my question is, can you suggest books with the above characteristics (the ones in bold)??\n\nThanks.",
