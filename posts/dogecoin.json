Many of you helped. Thank you! \n\n\nThere were many posts made by the community and they all have good information in them. Some of these posts have been kept up to date and they are below. \n\n___\n\n* [The Ultimate Simple Guide for Buying, Trading and Storing Dogecoin ](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dogecoin\/comments\/mso3z0\/the_ultimate_simple_guide_for_buying_trading_and\/)\n\n___\n\n\n* [How to buy Dogecoin in 5 easy steps in 5 easy hours](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dogecoin\/comments\/l7np1m\/how_to_buy_dogecoin_in_5_easy_steps_in_5_easy\/)\n\n___\n\n* [How to Buy\/Own Dogecoin: Lowest fees](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dogecoin\/comments\/n0y13z\/beginners_guide_how_to_buyown_dogecoin_with_the\/)\n\n___\n\n* [How to buy Doge for in 5 eezy steps (FOR DUMDUMS)](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dogecoin\/comments\/l7nxxp\/how_to_buy_doge_for_in_5_eezy_steps_for_dumdums\/) \n\n___\n\n* [How to Purchase Dogecoin in 2021](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dogecoin\/comments\/l7ok46\/how_to_purchase_dogecoin_in_2021\/) \n\n \n\n___\n\n* [HOW TO BUY DOGE COIN SO SIMPLE SUCH WOW](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dogecoin\/comments\/l7nzb5\/how_to_buy_doge_coin_so_simple_such_wow\/)\n\n___\n\n* [How to buy Cryptocurrency in an easy way and get some free money by my referral.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dogecoin\/comments\/l7po3q\/for_beginner_how_to_buy_cryptocurrency_in_an_easy\/)  \n\n___\n\n\n* [DOGECOIN - How to buy DOGE COIN with cheapest trading fee](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dogecoin\/comments\/l88yrw\/dogecoin_how_to_buy_doge_coin_with_cheapest\/)\n\n___\n\n* [How to buy Dogecoin TODAY](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dogecoin\/comments\/l82jfq\/how_to_buy_dogecoin_today\/)\n\n___\n\n* [How To Buy DOGECOIN (Simple & Easy) UK,AUST,EUROPE,ASIA](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dogecoin\/comments\/lag3ig\/how_to_buy_dogecoin_simple_easy_ukausteuropeasia\/)\n\n___\n\nTo the moon!\n\nBonus message - I've allowed referral links to be used in these posts and links even though they are not allowed to be used generally in the subreddit. NEVER listen to financial advice from anyone other than a professional financial advisor! That includes on reddits posts and comments. \n\n---\n\nEdit: The posts above can be edited any time by the people who wrote them. If you feel there is a serious error or mistake please send modmail and I will remove the post and ask the OP to sort it out.\n\n---\n\nEdit Edit.. This post was refreshed in April 2021, June and November. Once a post gets a few months old and reddit stops comments. We can't have that! I have rearranged the posts above in order of the last time they were updated so the most updated posts are at the top.\n\nWARNING. Do NOT fall for hype. Don't think you're going to get instantly rich. Don't trust random people offering financial advice. Cryptocurrency is the wild wild west of investing and many people want to take your money and run. You must 'educated' yourself with the good and the bad. You must understand what you're doing.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1636622219.0},{"title":"DOGECOIN DAILY DISCUSSION","author":"42points","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dogecoin\/comments\/11q4swk\/dogecoin_daily_discussion\/","text":"Hi Shibes,\n\nWelcome to todays Daily Discussion post. **YOU ARE DOGECOIN!**\n\nIf you are looking to safely store your coins for the long term check the links in the \"How to buy DOGECOIN\" post at the top of the subreddit. \n\nIf you want to give someone else DOGECOIN on Reddit check out \/r\/sodogetip \n\nYou can also get the latest version of the dogecoin wallet (version  1.14.6) from www.dogecoin.com \n\n---\n\nHere are some links and topics that people have wanted me to post here.

This is because Dogecoin, like many other cryptocurrencies, has a fixed maximum supply. According to its protocol, there will never be more than 129.1 billion Dogecoins in circulation.\n\nHowever, unlike some other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin has an inflationary issuance schedule. The current rate of new Dogecoin issuance is 10,000 coins per minute, which results in an annual inflation rate of approximately 4%. This means that while the maximum supply is fixed, new coins are constantly being added to the circulating supply.\n\nDespite this, Dogecoin has a deflationary aspect to its monetary policy because the rate of new issuance decreases over time. Specifically, the rate of new issuance is designed to decrease by 5% every year. This means that the annual inflation rate will decrease over time and eventually reach zero, at which point the circulating supply will remain fixed.\n\nIt's worth noting that the deflationary aspect of Dogecoin's monetary policy is relatively minor compared to its inflationary aspect, and that the inflation rate will remain relatively high for many years to come. Additionally, other factors such as changes in demand and use case can also affect the value and inflation\/deflation dynamics of any cryptocurrency.","upvote_ratio":0.4,"created_utc":1678643243.0},{"title":"Buying the dip but it keeps dipping","author":"djzanenyc","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/em8hnzjnf7na1.jpg","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1678563690.0},{"title":"Saturday crafting","author":"Noonish1234","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/8jo7sqfmi7na1.jpg","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.79,"created_utc":1678564691.0},{"title":"GM is the way \u2615","author":"TheDogeAcademy","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/s311d9fsx4na1.jpg","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1678551475.0},{"title":"Doge on weekend","author":"Blessing-2020","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/8jmgvo80r1na1.gif","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1678494868.0},{"title":"Bought the dip $500","author":"Sk8andsurvive","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/oi74gzafl1na1.jpg","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1678492990.0},{"title":"No matter what further financial chaos imperils the world, at least 1 Doge = 1 Doge","author":"GorgeousMetal","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dogecoin\/comments\/11ojre9\/no_matter_what_further_financial_chaos_imperils\/","text":"The sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank is reportedly imperiling many startups, venture capital, and established tech companies that had some or all of their money there.

It is now considered a legitimate alternative to traditional currencies such as the US dollar or Euro.\n\nUser Case:\n\nJohn is a freelance graphic designer who works for clients all over the world. He used to accept payments in US dollars or Euros, but he has recently switched to Dogecoin. Here's why:\n\n1. Lower transaction fees: John used to lose a significant amount of money on transaction fees every time he received a payment in a different currency. With Dogecoin, transaction fees are significantly lower, allowing him to keep more of his earnings.\n2. Faster transactions: With traditional currencies, it can take several days for payments to be processed and received. With Dogecoin, transactions are almost instantaneous, meaning John can get paid more quickly.\n3. Global acceptance: More and more people and businesses are accepting Dogecoin as a legitimate form of payment, meaning John can use his earnings to buy goods and services anywhere in the world.\n4. Decentralized: Dogecoin is decentralized, meaning it is not controlled by any government or financial institution. This makes it less vulnerable to inflation and other economic factors that can devalue traditional currencies.\n\nOverall, John has found that using Dogecoin has made his business more efficient and profitable. He expects that as more people begin to accept Dogecoin, it will become an increasingly popular and widely used cryptocurrency.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1678127657.0},{"title":"In the doge holder I am the strongest one","author":"Natural-Homework6916","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dogecoin\/comments\/11kmmlw\/in_the_doge_holder_i_am_the_strongest_one\/","text":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/p1ex5kktb8ma1.jpg?width=1512&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6036d7b1c69476e4c1b97e57ceb24040f9e5f815","upvote_ratio":0.73,"created_utc":1678156707.0},{"title":"let's go doge the day needs to keep going and rise like the sun and stay","author":"Radiant_Ad_3411","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dogecoin\/comments\/11ka6u2\/lets_go_doge_the_day_needs_to_keep_going_and_rise\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1678128907.0},{"title":"\"Dogeism\" #Dogecoin","author":"Zealousideal_Big7778","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/el4uzf25w4ma1.png","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1678115070.0},{"title":"the good ole days.
