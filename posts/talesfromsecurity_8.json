I'm a security guard, not a secretary!).  \nFortunately for me, the BM (hurhur) is cool as fuck and so -apart from fielding calls from his crazy stalker lady- it's pretty laid back (also, AC for the win!).  BM is ex-navy and I'm ex-army (he was an officer, I was enlisted) and so we joke back and forth quite a bit and talk about places we've been and whatnot...typical office stuff. We're sitting around doing the usual BS and coffee routine this morning when his phone rings. A few seconds later he's up and hauling balls out of the office, saying to me \"keep an eye on the cameras, I've got to get to the lobby\".    \nI have a seat in front of the monitor just in time to see the paramedics trying to revive a lady who had apparently collapsed after going through the screening station at the main entrance.     \nAfter a few minutes it was obvious that she wasn't responding to treatment and shortly after that they covered her and carted her out.   \nOnce the BM returned to the office we reviewed the footage and watched her walk up to security, smile and chat with the screener who was checking her in, collect her belongings and take all of three steps before she stops and puts a hand to her forehead. In the footage you can see her face clearly as she pales visibly and says \"I don't feel well...\" then she just dropped. I think she was dead when she hit the ground, I couldn't tell if she was still breathing, but the reactions of the people around her seem to indicate that she wasn't (one of the building officers immediately began CPR). \nIt was such a surreal experience, like a silent movie (our cams don't record sound).    \nI've never had to watch someone die on the job before. \nThe worst part (for me, anyhow) was that the lady bore a distinct resemblance to my granny (who's still strong at 96 -go granny!-)   \nI think I need a drink and maybe a hug...  \n  \n**TL;DR - Watched a lady die on camera, it was mildly traumatic.** \n",

        "text": "Background: I spend my weekends working as a doorman for a bar in a small town in the north of England.\n\n\nThis happened a few months back, but I didn't think to post it. As this sub needs content, I feel late may be better than then never!\n\n\nIt's early on in a Friday night shift, maybe around 10 PM. A mixed group of around 10-15 people come to the door; all ages, all well-dressed, all well-spoken and well sober. All, except for one lady. She's around 50, tottering along as she approaches our venue, clutching onto a gentleman of around the same age. As the group approached, I was thinking how she was so much drinker than the rest of them. So, I decided to have a little chat with her, to discern whether she's as smashed as she appears. \n\n\nWhen I began to talk to her, she answered my questions about where the group have been that night etc quite well. Slurred, but quite well, if a little distractedly. The gentleman she was with helped her with a few of the questions. I was undecided on whether she was drunk, or was suffering from some sort of motor neurone disease. The gentleman she was with explained that the group was from a church, and that she did indeed have a \"health problem\". I decided to let them in on the condition that if she was tottering about too much, and was in danger of harming herself or others, health problem or not, she'd be asked to leave by one of the door staff inside. I didn't want her slipping on a spilt drink, or walking into someone and getting herself into any bother. The gentleman agreed that this was fair enough.\n\n\nAround half an hour after the group had entered, one of their number, a timid young man, came outside to tell me that there was a lady inside who was a little worse for wear. I thanked him for letting me know, and followed him inside so he could point out the punter in question (I'm sure you can see where this is going).\n\n\nIt was, of course, the lady with health problems. I informed her that she'd have to leave, as she was clearly too intoxicated to be in the venue. Without her crutch-man, she was obviously absolutely hammered. She came willingly enough, despite walking into a few chairs on the way out, and being supported by myself.\n\n\nShe stayed on the front door for a few minutes, groggily waiting for someone to bring out her coat. The individual tasked with doing so was the crutch-man, who informed me that she did, indeed, have a health problem. The health problem wasn't a motor neurone disease, however. Oh no. It was fucking alcoholism. He seemed to be under the impression that because she was an alcoholic, the usual rules of not being too intoxicated in a licensed venue didn't apply to her. Livid is not the word. This church group, well, the crutch-man, had led me to believe that she wasn't drunk, but was suffering from a health condition which caused her lack of motor skills, essentially guilting me into letting her in. It was my error, but his tactics left a sour taste.\n\n\nOn the way out, an hour or so later, the rest of the group apologised, and said they were very uncomfortable with the whole situation. They had no idea she had an alcohol problem until that night! Awkward one for her the following Sunday, I'm sure.\n\n\nJust goes to show, sometimes it's best to trust your instincts and, as always on the door, assume the worst of people.",

I check it out and since there isn't anything wrong, I move along. Then, I see a lady with her dog by the apartments, and she sees me. She waves me over to complain about the car. She says the alarm has been going off for 30 minutes. \n\nI wanted to tell her that I was not going to break into someones car just to disable the car alarm. I wanted to tell her to go f*ck herself because she chose to move into a god forsaken, mall-bound, mall-facing apartment. I mean, who the hell would want to move into an apartment that is farting distance from a shopping destination. You knew what you were getting yourself into when you when you signed this damn lease. People drive through here at all times of the day and night.

This is a story of one of my most epic moments as a guard. \n\nThis evening is paticularly busy as it is a sold out backstreet boys reunion tour, and as most of you know the on duty supervisors are scrambling around trying to find out how many guards we have..... which as always is not enough lol. I dont really pay much attention as im either put as a front row walker, or backstage. Tonight they want to be extra safe and have me right behind the stage to keep an eye on the empty seats as this is also a NHL hockey arena and they dont want runners trying to get on stage from the back empty rows. Which is fine by me because now im behind the speakers and dont have to listen to their shitty music blasting in my ears all night. So first up as opening Act is Victoria duffield, which by the way she is super nice. After her set she talked to me for a bit. \n\nSo as the sound techs reset the stage for the main performance the head supervisor comes and asks if i can please go guard their dressing rooms as they need a experienced guard their to deal with any situations that may arise. Cool with me, the dressing rooms are under the stage and all you can hear is the bass :D perfect! Plus now i get to talk to their super attractive makeup arists for the rest of the night. So the night goes on and my stomache starts getting a bit upset. I get that feeling in my gutt and i know that i have to fart something fierce. I dont want to just let one rip next to the makeup artists though, so i hold it. It was about an hour later just holding in this demon of a fart, letting it brew in its own stink that the makeup artists took a break in between set changes. After a few moments with no one around I quickly siezed my opportunity and unleashed the fury of satan out my ass. I mean i damn near shit myself. Right then the makeup artists rush back in and the backstreet boys came in for another set change. Right away someone smells it and they all joke it was one or the other who farted. And that ladies and gents is how i crop dusted the backstreet boys.",

So needless to say giving him a piece of paper saying you cannot be on the property accomplishes duck all. So one night my pal Rusty is drunk in one of the stairwells. Its 4a.m. no one is around for him to bug so i politely asked him if he could be gone by my next round in an hour. So an hour goes by and i get to the stairwell expecting good old Rusty to still be drunk as a skunk passed out. But no. Thats when i found it. The biggest log of shit i have ever seen in my entire life. Turns out Rusty's odd talent, and the reason why police wont deal with him is he can shit on command.",

        "text": "I work as a Revenue Protection Officer on a busy railway route in England. The railway company I work for offer two classes of travel; First Class and Standard Class. The main difference is that First Class has wider seats, more leg room and is generally more private because it has an opaque glass door between it and the standard class. Obviously we charge between 1/4 and 1/3rd extra to sit in First Class. Passengers sitting in First Class with a standard class ticket are liable to a penalty fare which is 2x the cost of the ticket. This is to act as a deterrent to ticketless travel.\nMy job consists of checking tickets on the train and issuing penalty fares to passengers with no ticket, sitting in the wrong class etc.\nI start checking tickets on this busy route one morning. \n\nEnter Little Lord Fauntleroy (LLF) and his mother and sister.\nLLF is about 6 or 7 years old and dressed up as if he is at university - complete with brill cream across his hair.\nHis sister is about 5 or 6 and dressed like any normal girl of that age. LLF's mother looks like the typical bored housewife who has little understanding of the world other than the supermarket and the hairdresser's. \n\n\"Tickets please\" I ask politely to everyone in First Class. \nLLF'S mother presents me with three standard class tickets and says \"He said we would need to upgrade these to sit here\"\n\"Who's \"HE\"?\" I ask.\nShe then looks at LLF sitting opposite her and says \"You told me we had to upgrade to first class\"\n\nIt's now obvious that instead of researching the rules regarding First Class herself, or just using common sense, she has taken advice on rail travel from a 6 year old.\nI explain to her that the tickets are not valid in this part of the traib and I will be issuing her with a penalty fare which will cost her just under £40 (~US$70)\n\n\"But he wants us to sit here, I didn't know we couldn't upgrade on the train\"\nBearing in mind that you haven't been able to buy a ticket on a train in Britain (except in extreme circumstances) since they were privatised 20 years ago.\nBy this time LLF hasn't said a word and is now staring out of the window ignoring everything that his mother is saying.\nI begin to write up the penalty fare and his mother hands over full payment in cash.\nShe then turns to LLF and says\n\"Right. This obsession with 1st Class stops NOW! Do you understand me?\" In a very stern voice.\nHe is completely unphased by this and just continues to stare out of the windows with his mouth resting on his hand.\nI hand her the receipt and explain the rest of the rules regarding the penalty fare (as I am required to by law).\nShe just folds it up, puts it in her purse and I move on to the next carriage.\n\nI couldn't help but think what a spoiled little sh*t would cost his mother £40 and then just \"blank\" her like that. The rest of the train wasn't even that crowded, so they could have sat anywhere. If that had been me when I was a child, I wouldn't have heard the end of it from my mother and with good reason!\n\nTLDR: Spoiled little sh*t of a child costs his mother £40 by convincing her to sit in 1st Class train carriage without a ticket because he feels he is too good to sit in standard class.",

        "text": "The site I currently work at is not exactly what I would call 'action packed'. During the week the building is occupied by a pretty tame work force. At night and during the weekends there is nobody here, aside from the occasional person putting in overtime. In short, it's a dull place.\n\nFor me that works out great, because I can spend time doing homework, reading a book, watching Netflix, or surfing reddit threads. I dont need a lot to keep me awake and alert.\n\nHad a guy that worked here (note the word 'had') who was what I like to call a *serial sleeper*. He would show up for shift with his pillow and blanket under his arm, ready to go. He brought his fuzzy slippers in with him and swapped his shoes out almost as soon as he was in the door.\n\nSleeping is one of those things that is listed in our rules as being grounds for instant termination. Dont get me wrong, our crew is pretty flexible with things during nightshifts or weekends when nobody is here, and two guards are present. If one guard is seriously exhausted and needs to shut his eyes and 'meditate' for a couple hours while his partner eyes the cameras, its not really a big deal, just as long as the patrols get done and everything else is on the up-and-up. \n\nWell, this particular guard took serial sleeping to a whole new level. Supervision was well aware of his snoozing habit, so they decided to put him on dayshift during the week for a while, thinking that he'd stay awake if he were actually surrounded by people and had the shuffle and bustle of the day-to-day ops (checking people in and out, taking package deliveries) to keep him busy. \n\nNope.\n\nCut to his dayshift. He's tilted back in one chair with his feet up in another chair. Head tilted back. Open mouthed snoring. Drool sliding out of the corner of his mouth...\n\nAnd it's not even like he's in a secluded security office. No sir. He's sharing an office with the day workers, so he's sitting at the security desk behind the main counter with three other non-security personnel in surrounding desks. They're talking on telephones and working computers while he snores rather loudly in front of them. Oh, and since he's behind the counter, he's also the first person visitors see when they come to visit. \n\nClassic. \n\nHis fuzzy slippers got a lot of compliments.... including when our GM decided to drop by for a surprise visit. \n\nDidn't go so well for him. \n\nFor a while our supervision couldnt do much. We were at bare minimum requirements for guards. Couldn't afford to let him go because it would make our schedule impossible to work and meet the required body count of guards per shift, even if every single guard was working every day on 12 hr shifts...\n\nso this guy got to slide for a while...\n\nWouldn't you know it, we got a fresh new batch of hires.\n\nThe serial sleeper was fired the same week. Nobody missed him much.\n\nStay lively, people.",

Two small buildings a short distance apart that need to be patrolled. At night the place is vacant, aside from the two guards on duty. Patrols are made once an hour. Guards take turns doing patrol on foot. No set route. You can prettymuch go wherever you want on patrol, just as long as you scan your FOB key at the designated spots. All the doors are locked (controlled by computer at the security office) and the FOB is the only way for a guard to open the locked doors.\n\nI'm brand new, so I dont have a FOB key yet. Boss tells me it will be a few days before he can get one programmed for me. Until then, me and the other guard are to share his FOB key. \n\nRighty-o. \n\nSo the other guard fills me on on the basics of the post, requirements, things to look out for, etc. He's a few years younger than me, but very professional, friendly, and seems to have a decent idea of what he's doing. I follow him around on the first two patrols of the night. I am somewhat surprised that he choses not to use any of the equipment from the office. I understood not taking the radio, since we were both walking right next to each other and nobody was back at the office to hear us, but there were some seriously dark areas that we had to walk through. Like, inky patches of darkness where you couldn't see the ground beneath your own feet. And it was grassy, uneven terrain. The other guard didn't have a flashlight of any kind. \n\nWell, we picked our way around. The basic layout of the two buildings was easy enough. We came back and made our incredibly boring log entry \"Situation Normal. Nothing to report.\" \n\nAn hour later it was my turn to patrol, solo this time, while the other guard stayed in the office. As I walked out I picked up the walkie and the big mag-lite that was kept on the desk. The other guard scoffed at me. \"What are you taking those for? Nobody uses those.\"\n\nI turned on the walkie and stuffed it in a pocket. \"If I fall into a gopher hole and twist my ankle I want to be able to radio for an ambulance.\"  He laughed at that. I added \"If I see someone out there fucking around at the fence-line, or just something strange and need to ask you about it, the radio is a lot faster and easier than pulling out my cell phone and wasting airtime.\n\nSo off I go on patrol. The Mag-Lite turns out to be completely useless. The bulb barely glows and emits only a dull yellow light. I come back, put the walkie back on the charger, ask if there are any batteries for the flashlight. There aren't.\n\nApparently, though, my thoughts about taking a radio waxed wise, so an hour later the other guard is ready to go out. He smiles and grabs the walkie and says I had a good point, even if he's SURE that he doesn't need the thing, he takes it anyway. He leaves the office. Goes down the hall, through a door. I hear the door slam shut behind him.\n\nTwo seconds later the radio crackles. \n\nTurns out the other guard had left his cell phone, as well as the FOB key, sitting on the table when he walked out.\n\nHe had effectively locked himself in a room with no way to get out, and no telephone present. \n\nAfter laughing at him for a few seconds I was gracious enough to take him the key and allow him to continue his patrol.\n\nAnd that, ladies and gents, is why you always take a f*cking radio.",

No real issues, the gentleman being escorted out was clearly very intoxicated, but coming peacefully. Once he was outside of our venue, I informed him he was too intoxicated to return, and he said he was going to wait for his friend. Fair enough; I ask him to stand just off our door, and he does. \"He\" will be referred to as \"One\" from here on out.\n\nA girl known by our bar staff as staff from another venue in the town then came out and told me that One had, along with his friend (still in the venue), been harassing a number of girls inside the venue.

Result. \n\nAs we got to the door, Two stated that his coat was still inside, along with One's. We allowed him to return to the interior of the venue, whilst being escorted by Tim, to grab his coat. At this point, I returned to the front door to prevent One from regaining entry.\n\nAfter around 10 minutes, there was no sign of Two, so I informed my colleague on the front door (John) that I was going inside to see what the crack was, and why it was taking so long to find these bloody coats.\n\nWhen I entered, I saw Two and Tim arguing about something. I went over, and it transpired that Two couldn't find the coats. I explained to Two that his time was up, and he'd have to leave anyway. He came willingly enough, and joined up with One on the front door.\n\nAt this point, the intoxicated duo decided that they had a legal right to regain entry to our venue (despite being far too intoxicated) to find their coats. I informed them that this wasn't going to happen, as Two had already been allowed back in to search for them, and had failed to find them. They'd simply have to come back tomorrow when they were sober.\n\nAfter much to-ing and fro-ing (during which Two INSISTED that he hadn't been allowed to look for his coat), John had to leave the front door to deal with another issue inside. Whilst he was inside, One started filming me. Not really got a problem with that, as I can't be bothered to argue the toss over whether it's acceptable for me to smash his phone in retaliation or not, so I dropped a little nod and a wink to the camera, stayed at my post, and resumed my usual stony expression.\n\nAfter a couple of minutes of filming, with John still inside, Two stated *very* loudly to One that it didn't matter about their coats, as if he didn't get his coat he was going to kill himself, and we'd have a suicide attempt on our hands. *Hello. This is interesting.*\n\nI continued to stand still, listening to the conversation One and Two were having, obviously for mine and the camera's benefit. After a few minutes, Two realised that I wasn't going to be cowed by his bluff. At this point, he took a debit card from his wallet, rolled up his sleeve (please bear in mind these chaps were 30-35 years old) and sliced across his wrist. \n\nOf course, nothing happened. \n\nSo he started sawing and sawing.\n\nI let him continue for a little while before telling him that, if he was serious, he needed to go down the tracks, not across. I think this was when he realised his ploy wasn't going to work.\n\nAt this point, John returned, and we had the same argument as before with them, informing them that they still weren't getting back in. After 15 minutes or so, they got the message and left. When I told John what happened while he was inside, he wouldn't believe me.\n\nI've made girls cry when I've told them they were too drunk to enter our bar. I've made *men* cry when I've told them the same. That's pretty pathetic. But this might just be the most pathetic thing I've ever seen on the door. A fake suicide attempt, for a couple of coats. Unbelievable. I wonder what One thought when he watched the video of the event. I'd be ashamed.",

        "text": "So excited that I found this subreddit! After binge reading a few (dozen) posts, I've decided to share one of my most memorable security stories. I feel it's important to mention that I'm a female security agent at a 5 star hotel with 4 years of experience. I'm used to people not taking me seriously, and usually, that's what I count on because I love the look on their face when they realize I'm not fucking around. So here it is.  \nOnce a year we have this huge event for a local private college. So it's basically one big frat party. We have a policy during this event that no one is allowed to bring alcohol from their room down to the event. I'm usually stationed at the elevators, instructing guests to throw their drinks away or go back upstairs.  \nThis past year, it was around 2 am and 10 hours into my shift. So I was done dealing with anyone's shit. This guy and his girlfriend get off the elevator with their solo cups, and I'm off to do my \"excuse me sir\" schtick, to ask them to get rid of their drinks. The guy couldn't understand why I wouldn't let him just take his drink and walk out of the hotel with it. I ask several times for him to throw it away or go back upstairs. Eventually he just ignores me and starts chugging his drink. I grab the cup and pull it away from his mouth, but he's not letting go. At this point I realize he's just going to dump it all over me. So I decide to beat him to it and I stare him right in the eye as I squeeze the solo cup until it breaks and whiskey drenches both of our sleeves and rip it out of his hand. I thank him, take his girlfriend's drink, and head off to find a mop. It was a small act, but made me feel so much better. The look on his face is still burned in my memory and makes me laugh.  \n\nTL:DR drunk frat asshole didn't want to hand over his drink, so I broke his cup, subsequently spilling liquor all over both of us,, causing him to finally fuck off. Don't worry, I cleaned it up. ",

I am not a big man and come bar close when it comes to start getting people out so we can clean (and obey the law), I get reactions like I'm coming off rude and pushy.  I usually go up to a group of people and say something along the lines of \"Hey guys, if you could finish up your drinks, we need to start closing up\".   All of a sudden people get angry at me like I'm trying to force them out of the bar when really I am just trying to do my job and get all non employees out so we don't get fined.\n\nI don't know if it's what I say or how I say it but I'm looking for tips to improve this aspect of the job. Regardless if its with regulars or first timers I still feel uncomfortable.  Any tips would be appreciated/if there is a better place to post this, please let me know.  Just trying to be a better bouncer and not a pushover that won't last long in the industry. Thanks.",

        "text": "So, i am not sure if this belongs here or not, but i figured its related. I work for a small security firm part time. My firm monitors the camera feeds from half a dozen local businesses. One of them is a out of state 24/7 hardware store. My job is to watch that feed, among others. [Insert the title here]\n\n\nIt was at about 2 in the morning. He was in the lumber yard. Filling a flat bed cart about 5 feet high with 2x4s and plywood. After it was full he started wandering from aisle to aisle, piling more crap on top of the plywood. Before he moved on to a new aisle, he would take a little notebook and a pen (or a f***** quill for all I can tell) out of his pocket, and wright something down. \n\n\nHe would spend a very long time in each aisle, playing with all the random stuff, fitting things together, and comparing things to other stuff he already had on the cart. He would sometimes go back to an aisle and put some stuff back, and replace it with something else. Employees (or random people wearing the same color of shirt) would occasionally walk by or through the aisle. This only happened about a few times, but each time he would move out of the way. They would otherwise just ignore each other. \n\n\nThis entire ordeal lasted about two hours. By the time he was done and heading out, his cart was huge, things looked like they were about to fall off, but somehow managed to hang on for dear life. It looked like he was having a rough time pushing that thing. He was pushing away towards the exit, but then he took a left turn at an aisle just before registers. right at the end are two large swinging doors. I am pretty sure that, when both are wide open, you could drive a city firetruck through. \nThis guy pushed the cart up to them nearly hitting the doors. He stopped to pull his notebook or a phone out of his pocket. He then played with it for a about 20 seconds and put it away. This guy then rammed the door with the cart. The doors seemed to open very easily as he progressed forward. As he passed the threshold he stopped and walked to the wall. He took something out of his pocket, and then dropped a piece of it in to a gray square on the wall (based on my angle, it was hard to tell, but I would guess he ripped something out of his notephonebook.) He finished pushing the cart through the doors, and they closed.  I am guessing the doors were hydraulic or something as they closed very fast and smoothly. \n\n\nNow at that point, I was starting to panic. I had no idea what just happened. I had no idea where those doors go. Every time I have seen those doors, they have been closed, and no one really bothers them. Except the cleaning crew... and the random customer. I couldn't really contact the employees directly unless its a life threatening situation, and I couldn't contact dispatch unless I see a crime, or a crime about to happen. \n\n\nAs I was trying to figure out what to do, I saw the cashier wander up to the door, and mess with the gray square for a minute. She then walk back to her register and started typing things in to it, while reading something in her hand. After she was done she took the long receipt and rolled it up, then placed it in her till. \n\n\nI wrote up a report, but it will most likely go ignored as its clear the employees know whats going on. I asked around my office, but only a few people said things like \"I think I saw someone like that\" or \"Was he the one with the baseball cap\". I looked up the address in Google Earth,  and as far as I can tell that door leads to a warehouse next door. I really haven't been able to dig up anything else about it.\n\n \nSince then I have kept a closer eye on that door, and have noticed him coming in, and exiting about twice a week, at random times of night. He picks up boxes of random supplies or tools, writes them down on his booknotephone, then uses it to unlock the doors after dropping something in that gray box. The box seems to be checked on a regular basis by random cashiers. \n\n\nI still have no idea who he is, or what is going on, but it doesn't seem to be an issue... so I guess ill just sit back and enjoy the show. So far this morning hes grabbed a can of paint, and is heading towards the vacuum aisle. ",

I signed up thinking i would patrol the inside of the mall, making friends with the eployees, flirt with the girls,  yadda yadda. Well the job mainly consisted of mobile patrol in the parking lot with a security  vehicle. Well while i was cruising through the parking lot looking for some crime to deter, i see this woman walking into the mall. She was maybe in her late 30s, she didn't look very old, still had a youthful appearance and she was dressed very well. Well as i see her walk in, i notice that she suddenly stopped and kind of held her head and then her stomach as if something was wrong or as if she was in pain\n\nThis was in the walkway near a main entrance where several people are walking and sitting. Im thinking maybe she might faint, have a heart attack or something serious so i keep a close eye and my heart starts beating because something might pop off.\n\nWell after a brief pause, she continues to walk in the store. Not even for a second, she suddenly stops again, squats on the ground as if ready to deprecate, and starts peeing? She was wearing a tight dress and she was going right through the dress, didn't even lift it up. I was just in awe and a little shocked and all i could do was watch. When she finished, she quickly got up and hastily made her way back to her car. I caught up to her and asked her if everything was fine and if she is ok. She said yes and that she just had a \"little accident\".\n\nLucky for her, nobody saw her do it. But there was a pretty big puddle there so i called in it and i radioed the housekeeping and i put one of those yellow wet floor signs over it. They came and eventually cleaned it up. I just wondered how that could happen? She wasnt a senior citizen, she was just a regular person. That was about the most weirdest thing i witnessed though.",

Me, I hate it with a passion. I would rather do 10 back to back NYE's than a single Melbourne Cup, which was today. This is what happened, italics to clarify context. Originally posted as a comment in /r/Melbourne.\n\n\"Earlier today, had to catch the 57 *(Tram that runs past the RaceCourse)* to go to work. Packed tram from the races of course, no biggie. Had my choice of either standing in a puddle of wine-vomit, or being pressed up against a guy with a girl resting her head \"sleeping\" on his lap. At least he covered it with his jacket. \n\nSome bloke started getting Agro at the back of the tram and a fight broke out, so the driver stopped and was then racially abused for it. I got off and caught the next one. \n\nWalked into my local on the way to work as my SO was having a drink there after netball. Got two steps in and another fight broke out. Helped the other Security boys clean that up *(I'm a permanent Consultant on the Owners payroll, so I can legally help, as long as I'm not actually drinking at the time)*. Had a coke, quick chat, pecked her on the cheek and walked the two minutes to work. \n\nWalked in to screeching women holding Champagne glasses in one hand and their shoes in the other, older men in suits were a lot more composed at their tables drinking XXXX Stubbies *(Pabst Blue Ribbon, but only favoured by Queenslanders for some reason)*. Staff were visibly pissed off, and thankful I was a bit early. Started pointing out people they had cut off. Heard a glass smash in the smoking deck out the front. \n\nRandom drunk CUB in a suit was slagging off one of our regulars for talking on his phone, and had told him to fuck off outta here. Politely inform the CUB that he can finish his drink and leave. Woman behind me chimes in, says the guy was removed from a bar around the corner earlier. He rounds on her, so I whip him into a full Nelson and start towards the door. He complains about the hold, so I tell him that I will release said hold when we get outside, and he is to walk offsite or the police will be called. He complies, miraculously. \n\nFuck.\n\nSpring.\n\nRacing.\n\nCarnival.\"\n\nSo, is there an event or similar that you dread working every time it rolls around?\n",

        "text": "Former S/O here with a story from today. Ya'll know the rules and regulations for both security AND loss prevention, so I imagine some of you will be just as shocked as I am. \n\n**TLDR** - Dipshit accuses me of stealing, orders me to remove clothing, realizes they fucked up, and then speed walks away.\n\nI was grocery shopping during rush hour at a locally owned store. I paid for my groceries and made it about ten feet outside the door before I was grabbed by the elbow and dragged back inside.\n\nI remember yelling \"WHAT THE FUCK?\" as I had no idea who was grabbing me or why. I realized it was a young, small woman who told me not to move. I stood there while she began going through my sweater and pant pockets. I asked her what she was doing and she said that I was under arrest for stealing.\n\nI attempted to push her hands away and was told that if I did it again she would cuff me. I was flabbergasted and completely confused. I KNOW I didn't take anything, yet I was being groped like 15 year old girl. I asked her what I supposedly stole but she wouldn't tell me and only said \"You know what you did wrong.\"\n\nI tried to get more information but she ignored me. She kept going through my pockets over and over, asking me where I put it. I told her I had no fucking idea what she was talking about, and then she grabbed my keys, phone and wallet and told me I could have them back as soon as I turned over the stolen merchandise.\nAt this point I was getting very pissed and couldn't convince her that I had done nothing wrong. She just kept repeating \"I saw you put it in your pocket, where is it?\" while repeatedly searching my pockets.\n\nI told her she wouldn't find shit on me, and at that point she told me to take off my sweater. I complied. Then she ordered me to lift up my shirt. I refused and she told me that if I don't then she was going to charge me (still don't understand that logic - completely wrong). I decided to comply because at this point I had no choice but to do so. It was her word against mine.\n\nSo, I lifted up my shirt. Being a fat ass I am very self conscious of my body, so when I see several people watching me and some laughing - my heart sank. I haven't felt that level of humiliation in a very long time.\n\nShe made me spin around while she felt around my waistband and chest. She then told me to take off my shoes and socks - and I did so. Once she checked ALL of me and didn't find anything I could tell she knew she fucked up. You know, the \"OH SHIT\" face.\n\nShe told me to put my stuff back on and said that if she caught me again there would be charges. She handed back my things, turned around and walked away rather quickly.\n\nLittle does she know that I used to work as both security and loss prevention for over five years. I am very well aware of the laws and rules you have to follow when working as such. If I had pulled that shit I would have been fired instantly. Could you imagine if a guy forced a girl to undress because they think she stole something? That guy would lose his job AND face charges.\n\nTomorrow morning I am going to speak with both the store manager and the boss of her security company. If all goes right, she hopefully won't work another hour in loss prevention. I am both embarrassed and furious and she is going to hear about it. I have shopped at that store for over ten years and now I am too embarrassed to go back.\n\nFucking twat.",

Final appeal is denied, so one day he is picked up to be deported. Guy seems calm, but at the airport he says he's gotta visit the johns. Since he isn't a prisoner per se they let him go in the booth on his own accord. Time goes by, they get worried, tells him he's gotta finish up. No response. After several tries with no reply they kick down the door.\n\nGuy's either crazy or a genius. They find him standing there naked, every inch of his body smeared with his own feces and with a crazy look in his eyes. *Ain't no way I'm going back!* Obviously touching this guy was above everyone's pay grade. He runs past the guards and across the airport, cops and guards follow at a safe distance and travellers who sees him suddenly decide to walk in opposite directions. When he gets out of the airport he is lucky enough to find a bike and then continues onto the highway, still naked and cowered in shit. A low speed pursuit follows, eventually they have to tackle the guy anyway. And I hear he was really slippery, too. But he did manage to spend more time in our beautiful country before they tried to deport him again.\n",

        "text": "[Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromsecurity/comments/2jqe3c/the_manchild_part_1/)\n\n\n*There is one man who makes all of security personal weep. One man who creates so much stress that he makes a grown ass man cry. But one man who stays too long after his shift against policy...he is...****The Manchild***\n\n\nA bit more back story, I was actually being trained to take over the Overnight shift at this plant. Pretty much all that it entailed was checking loaded trailers hourly (Temperatures!) and ensuring end of day paperwork got to its rightful place. Simple, quiet, serene. \n\n\nExcept that Manchild had no real friends outside of work. I honestly pitied that part of him for quite some time. Yet after some time, I realized why. \n\n\nHe's a goddamn Manchild. There's nothing wrong with his head, he's not mentally handicapped, no real mental disability to speak of. He just has absolutely no idea how socializing and mingling fucking works. \n\n\nMC managed to get a change in his schedule to work second shift after one of our second shifters went on to greener pastures. Our second shift was literally composed of two guys plus the turnstyle guard's short shift. More on his Second Shift Shenanigans at a later story. \n\n\nMC made a habit of staying after his shift to \"Supervise\" me. At first it was appreciated, he answered questions I had and it made doing my job a bit easier. However there were nights where he would come off of a shift at a different site and simply appear in the command shack for hours at a time. Strictly against policy but, for a short time I didn't mind the company. But after a repeated performance even AFTER I was *clearly* trusted by SS to watch my own shit, it got annoying. Almost demeaning. He'd argue with me on SS' policy that countered his own ideas. It became aggravating to the point of repeated complaints. \n\nThere was one night where he honestly saved my bacon within my first three months on the job. I let in a semi for a delivery, said semi promptly GUNNED it into the site, narrowly missing me by 3 feet while the semi was going approximately 35 MPH past me. If there was ever a moment where I should have properly shit my pants, right there was it. \n\n\nMC happened to be hanging around this night. Saw the episode, and promptly chased after the driver (on foot) all the way to receiving. All I know what happened afterwards was what MC told me:\n\n&gt;\nMC: \"WHAT IN THE GODDAMN HELL ARE YOU DOING?!\"\n\n&gt;Truck Driver: \"My GODDAMN TRUCK IS ACTING UP SO IN ORDER TO MAKE IT HERE ON TIME I HAD TO GUN IT THROUGH THE GATE SO IT WOULDN'T FUCKING DIE ON ME\"\n\n&gt;MC:\"You NEARLY hit one of our guards on your way in. I need to see your drivers information.\"\n\n&gt;TD:\"You don't need to see shit until I get this unloaded\"\n\n&gt;MC:\"I need your drivers information, and your phone number\"\n\n*This continued back and forth for about ten minutes until the driver finally relented. MC wrote down the information and came back*\n\nDriver finally finishes up his unloading, comes to the front gate where I stop him, and promptly rip his asshole myself. After some convincing (read: Threats of cops) I obtained pictures of the Semi, the driver, the driver's license, and his plates. A report was created and filed, and driver was promptly told the f-off. \n\nSuffice to say I appreciated MC's presence that night. But after that his presence on my shift became...an annoyance. Nothing major, but enough to the point where I wanted to be left the hell alone. \n\nCome to find out the next week the driver was banned from the property. Justice was indeed served that week and drinks were had that weekend. ",

        "text": "So this happened back in 2012 when I was working for American butthead  security (not real name) but from now on ill refer to them as AB. \n[Back story]\nI had been working at this site which was a former glass plant turned truck yard/warehouse. We worked 3 12 hour shifts from 6-6. In this 12 hour shift we did 6 rounds which would take 2hrs to complete 1 round. During these rounds we would hit wand point a total of about 175 way overkill hell the damn wand didn't even work half the time. One night I calculated that we walked at least 19 miles a night through parking lots and old 1800's warehouse with wooden creaky floor, on the 2nd floor walls was graffiti saying \"Screw Nixon\" we didn't dare go  to the third floor was too dangerous duty to the leaky roof. We had a wand point on the 2nd floor inside an old 1970s era office area with shag carpet ect damn this was a museum, anyways the office was shut down in the late 70s by the IRS. We would also walk across train tracks, walk the perimeter in a very bad area (section 8 apartments across the street where shootings happened almost every night). This site was huge and only had 1 unarmed officer.\n\nNow to the story.\nAfter working this site for a few mths off and on (I was a Rover). I was driving to work one night and was running late, when less than a block away from my site I passed 2 stopped cars in the road and the guy in the first car had started shooting at the guy talking to him at his window. I was hit and continued to work whilst on the phone with 911. Dont want to get to graphic but I spent 5 days in the hospital and a total of 30 days off recouping. When I went to call my manager back at Ab he informed me that I was terminated due to falsifying company documents, due to me not calling and notifying him I wouldn't be on site the night I was shot. Now if you've ever had to make a 911 call and the ambulance is on the way you know damn well that the operator wont hang up till the ambulance gets there.\nKinda on topic for this thread hope you like it.\nTheMageLives\nP.s if I need to fix anything please let me know",

        "text": "Greetings Security folks. Some back story on this, I used to work for a security firm at a plant facility long ago. I saw some mildly crazy stuff while working at that plant facility. Had my fair share of disagreements with staff, and grumbling about either dumb policies or policies that never will exist that should. \n\n\nUnfortunately, this little series isn't a story about any of that. Its about one man I was ~~cursed~~ blessed to work with for a time while at this plant and with this firm. I call him...**The Manchild** (*lightning and thunder effects*)(Henceforth referred to as \"MC\").\n\n\nMC was at heart, a good kid. Or at least, he was when I first encountered him and worked with him. Later down the line I would find this to be a...incorrect assessment. At least it would leave me thinking it was. MC was former Military, or at least I barely believed that until his former commanding officer confirmed that for me. \n\n\nThe scene is my first day on the job working the plant, learning the ropes. These cars get in, deliveries need to be called, semi's need to be checked, make sure to do *incredibly high mountain of paperwork*, etc. My training shift is split right down the middle by the first/second shift switch. \n\n\nSecond Shift starts and this is where I meet MC. At this time, MC was on one of our lowest tier positions at the planet: Turnstyle Guard. Making sure people aren't taking things out with them in their lunches, that kind of thing. This is all anyone at the time was willing to risk trusting MC with, and I would find out later that it would have been wiser to keep him at that position. \n\n\nFast forward to about a half hour near the end of my shift. MC radios in that he's got a bio emergency. I huff on over (about 100 yard walk) and take over for him. Simple enough job, trained dog could take care of it.  \n\n\n*Forty Minutes Later* I radio down to the command center that I'm ten minutes past the end of my shift. Site super loses his crap, loses even more of it after I tell him why. We have a porta-potty about 110 yards from this turnstyle. MC had been inside said porta-potty for about 40 minutes. Both worried and annoyed that MC has been in there for 40 minutes, SS (Site Super) checks the porta-potty by knocking on it. \n\n\nLess than 2 minutes later MC emerges, just fine. Nothing wrong, claims he had an issue in the john. To my surprise (For the only time ever), everyone doesn't believe him. Apparently, this was MC's way of \"Getting out of work\" as I would find out later, and he'd abuse it like a redheaded step child. \n\n\nThat's it for my introduction to MC. There are many stories to tell, and they are far more...uh...interesting than MC taking a 40 minute crap. \n\n",

        "text": "As a camera-watcher, I see some strange stuff occasionally, however this one tops my list.\n\nA camera on the far end of the parking lot catches my eye as a car pulls in. Gray-colored sedan, at least ten years old, towing a small trailer. It turns around before it gets to the gate and pulls over on the side of our small access road, right next to the camera. As I'm catching the plates on video, I notice that there's something in the trailer. Two wooden crates with mesh tops, and the contents are moving around inside. Zoom in, and I see that they're filled with pigeons, roughly 25 per crate. Driver, an older man, steps out, followed by what had to be his daughter. They walk over to their respective sides of the trailer and kinda mull about for a minute.\n\nMy first impression is that it's some kind of craigslist sale, and they're meeting someone there. It's happened before, some guy sold some 50 gallon drums a few weeks ago. Not this time, however. The girl reaches into the trailer, unlatches the side of one of the crates, and the pigeons fly out. The man does the same for his. They get back in the car and drive off.\n\nSo now I've got roughly 50 pigeons flying around the parking lot. They've definitely pooped on some cars, and probably my truck as well. Fuckin assholes.\n\nEdit: I've been spelling pigeons wrong for a while now",

        "text": "So I work occasional jobs at a smallish Finnish security firm in a small town (population under 100k), whenever there's a job that the boss can't get regulars in time for. Basically the company has a facebook group, and they notify of any jobs there and you comment if you want in on it. Freelancing would be a good word for it, I suppose.\n\nAnyway, I started at the company in july working at a week long music festival, big enough that the company literally didn't have enough manpower to cover their contract, so they hired freelancers. So the week goes fine, and on the last day I'm having a discussion with the boss (I guess you could call him the CEO) which ends up something like this:\n\nMe: Anyways, if you need more manpower at any time, I'm available.\nCEO: Oh, you feeling unemployed at the moment?\nMe: Yeah, well, more work wouldn't be a bad thing. (I literally had nothing coming my way)\nCEO: Well, want to come in tomorrow? From 1400 to 1800, easy 4 hour job.\nMe: Sure, what's the location?\nCEO: Town hall. They have some kind of hush-hush event going on in there, and they need 2 guys there to keep wandering civilians and the media out. Jack (name changed) is going there too.\nMe: Allright, sounds good. Clothing?\nCEO: Straight pants, black shirt. Dress shoes.\n\nSo the next day I show up at the town hall backyard, Jack is already there being briefed by the contact. We make introductions, he gives me a quick version and gives us both his cell number just in case. In short, we were to hang around the backyard for an hour while the hush-hush event people arrived trough the front door (they didn't want us seeing them, I guess, which seems pointless in retrospect since I saw them leaving anyway), after which I would move to the front door and watch it, and let in a few celebrities (writers, philosophers) that were coming in to be interviewed or something. Jack was to stay in the back, watching the gate so that only authorized cars drove in the parking lot.\n\nSo we hang around the back with Jack, talking about stuff like how the CEO put 2 newbies on a high profile location like the town hall, and overall getting to know eachother. After about an hour, the contact comes out back and asks me to follow him to the front door. I do so, he shows me the deal and tells me where to direct the hush-hush people if any arrive late.\n\nSo I stand in this small lobby-ish glorified stairwell, fake marble all around me (I looked closely, it was painted on), with little to no air circulation so it was pretty hot in that shirt, waiting for anyone to knock on the door. Eventually a few late guests arrived and went in, the contact checked up on me a few times, but nothing more.\n\nI don't know how much time had passed before there was a ruckus on the door (I was bored, lost track of time), someone pulling the handle. I opened up to see that there was a woman, approximately 30-35 years old, standing at the door. She had a long dark blue coat and a ponytail, with a small handbag hanging next to her waist. She started asking questions, like is the town hall open for visitors etc. I thought she was a tourist from the music festival looking for cultural enrichment and explained that she can't come in, until I spotted a transparent earpiece on her right ear. My thoughts instantly shifted to the possibility that it was security for one of the celebrities, checking if they were in the right place or if the security at the location was any good. My mind was racing to find a logical explanation.\n\nShe soon left, but I kept thinking who she really was. About 10 minutes pass by, and there's a knock on the door. I open, it's the same woman. She shows me a police badge, and says she is from Suojelupoliisi (straight translation \"security police\", but they're basically the Finnish equivalent of secret service). I check the badge and it seems legit, she says that the president is on his way to be interviewed by media in a nearby museums enclosed yard, but since it was starting to rain, they wanted to know if the interview could be kept in the town hall.\n\nI just thought \"This is too much. I've done this job for exactly 8 days, and now this?\" I focused as I realized that this is going to happen whether I want it or not, so I got my phone from my pocket and called the town hall contact. I asked him if it was okay, he said that it's fine and that he will be there soon. I told this to the cop, and she asked \"How soon is that then? The president will be here in less than 15 minutes.\" I called him again, and confirmed that he was indeed arriving in 5 minutes.\n\nSo the contact arrived, they went upstairs to find a suitable conference room, and came back down soon after, talking to her sleeve to confirm the location info and guide the convoy there. A few minutes later 2 media crews arrived (assumedly from the original interview location). Soon after that, 3 unmarked, blue minivans pulled up. From the back and front vans a total of 8 men came out, all clad in suspiciously unsuspicious civilian clothing. From the middle van rose one man, dressed in a checkered shirt and gray straight pants. He and 3 of the escorts walked in past me, the man from the middle van said hello to me, and they all walked up the stairs.\n\nWhat followed was an extremely tense 20 minutes as the cops stood outside, with the woman walking up and down, occasionally showing up on a balcony that was visible from a window at the end of the stairwell. Tense for me, that is, since I knew who was in there and how experienced I was. Of course I also knew that the cops obviously prepared and planned around local security instead of including it, but still.\n\nAt the end of that 20 minutes, they walked back down, straight in to the vans. The policewoman thanked me and left. The hush-hush guests left, the writers came and left, but nothing significant. After the contact relieved us I told Jack that the president came by, and he was pretty jealous since nothing happened at the backyard.\n\nAlso, that was the time I learned an important lesson: Security is never told about the shit that actually matters.\n\nSo anyways, that was the time I met the President of Finland. Not a lot of action or humor in that story, but I just felt like sharing since it'll probably stick in my memory for a while.",

        "text": "Here is an FPS I posted that someone suggested I put here. If I get enough interest I'll post some more juicy tales about this shitshow of a job.\n\nSo, here are the characters of this beetus-ridden shitfest:\n\n&gt;&gt; Be (or don't be) me, our trusty protagonist /u/octopusghost, 5'7\" and 135lbs of of lean wannabe amateur MMA fighter with a personality like steel wool dipped in acid.\n\n&gt;&gt; Do not be Securiham, 6' and 400+ pounds of pure, unadulterated beetus. Friendly, but a bit strange and possessed enough fatlogic to feed a hamily of four.\n\nNow for some background:\n\nThis summer I took a job and a large security company known for shitty employment practices and shittier service. If you work in the industry you probably know of it. It has one of those stupid hybrid names like  \"Ameribank\", or \"Insuracorp\". I didn't want the job, but it was the first place to call me back after I submitted an application, and I had already started training by the time Pizza Hut, Carls Junior, and Cinnebon could be arsed to call me. Even in training, it was obvious that the job was a magnet for hamplanets and moons. I was one of four people in the classroom that wouldn't be considered overweight or obese, an impressive fact considering what part of the U.S. this took place in. However, among all the fatties there was one ham that stood out among all the rest. This man was truly gargantuan. This man was... SECURIHAM!\n\nSecuriham was striking. Weighing in at over 400lbs, he was truly a sight to behold. His gut was so large it looked like he had a chubby eight year old stuffed in his shirt. Serious, it was a massive slab of meat that hung halfway down to his knees. When he got in and out of his 1970s era tiny green Toyota, it leaned heavily toward the left and looked like it was praying for a swift death. When he got out of the car, the thing seemed to breath a massive sigh of relief. Whenever he used the breaks it sounded as if the car was screaming in agony. Once I saw him in the car with is whale of a girlfriend, and it looked like he car was a quarter of an inch from scraping the undercarriage against the ground. Note: none of this is an exaggeration in the slightest. This man had such a large gravitational field that such things are unnecessary.\n\nNow let's get on with the meat ^tee^hee of the story:\n\nI was guarding an empty parking lot adjacent to the $100,000 generator that Securiham was supposed t be guarding. A few weeks previously, some assholes had attempted to hitch the thing up to a truck and drive off with it. Because of that, it was decided that the damn thing needed 24hr supervision. \n\nAs I was making my rounds in the parking lot, I noticed something odd: Securiham's car seemed to have gone missing. I walked over to the generator and lo and behold Securiham was missing as well, though the ground was litter with McBeetus bags that confirmed be had been there not long before. I walked around a bit and waited for him to come back. Maybe he was just taking an unauthorized bathroom break?\n\nTen minutes passed...\n\n&gt;&gt; Still no sign of Securiham\n\nFifteen minutes passed...\n\n&gt;&gt; Securiham is still nowhere in sight.\n\nTwenty minutes pass...\n\n&gt;&gt; No Securiham.\n\nAt the 30 minute mark, I finally pull out my cellphone and begin to dial my boss. Just as it starts to ring, Securiham rolls in with a gigantic sack of McBeetus. With a sigh, I kill the call before my boss answers and go back to my post. Just another shitty shift.\n\nTL;DR\n\nHamplanet coworker abandons post to fulfill beetus cravings. I am to lazy to report him to my boss.\n",

        "text": "So, im taking the LRT (my citys version of a subway or metro) to go to a friends house. Im in plain clothes. The station is at the end of the line, and its a slow day, so its very quiet. Almost no one around. As I walk down the platform to leave the station, I see two teenage girls, probably 15-16ish, looking very apprehensive. They are talking to a maintanence technitian, who is looking very disinterested. I slow down and let my curiousity get the best of me, see what is going on here. The girls are apparently complaining about a \"creepy guy\" who keeps following them around and they dont know what to do. The tech is kinda being \"well did he do anything\" and \"i dunno what you want me to do about it\",  he obviously wants to brush this off and go about his business.\nA man gets off the train. He is STARING at them. This guy is giving off a majorly threatening vibe. The girls start telling the maintenance dude this is the guy. The maintenance guy doesnt even look, he just points to one of the emergency call boxes and tells the girls to call security and let them deal with it, then he goes back to his work. He doesnt leave, but he clearly isnt paying attention and is trying not to be involved. The girls are basically on the verge of panic as the creepo starts to walk down the platform towards them. \n\nAt this point, I walk up to the girls, hold out my security ID, and tell them Im an off duty guard, and that Im gonna stick around until security shows up. Ttell them to go push the emergency call button, then i jog over to the guy and cut him off. I start off by telling the dude \"hey, they are just scared you might be following them,  how about you just go around and exit over there\" as i indicated a nearby exit.\n\nHe starts out by saying hes not following them (clearly he is, if he just wanted to exit thered be no reason to move towards the girls as they were near the end of the platform, away from the exits) and quickly his tone gets threatening and he tells me im just a \"little man\" and that I had better get out of his way. I pull out my cell phone and open the camera app. He asks me what Im doing, I say \"gathering evidence\". He tells me that he doesnt want to be on camera, I say we're in public, so too bad.\n\n He begins to get threatening again, telling me he is \"going to get past\" me. I am still holding my security ID, so i hold it up and say \"no, youre not\" in the hopes that itbll make him hesitate a bit. He tells me he doesnt give a shit who I am, but regardless he stops trying to push into my personal space, and instead keeps trying to walk around me, while i continually just cut him off. A train operator walks into the station to start his shift and take over the empty, waiting train beside us. The operator sees this and asks the guy what he's doing. The guy says \"im just taking the train\" and he gets on the train. The operator leaves and goes to the front car.\n\nThe dude gets off the train again. At this point there are now other people milling around, and we'd moved down the platform a fair bit. The girls make a run for it, but from where we were standing, he couldnt see them. He could only see me. So I stayed put. The guy gets back on the train again. I guess he must have spotted the girls, because he tried to get off again, but the train took off before he could open the door. I waved at him as he went by.",

        "text": "I had just interviewed and gotten a shitty part time job (2 six hour shifts, sat and sun, noon to 6pm) at the local drive-in/flea market. The silver lining here was free movies and popcorn. I had a bicycle and a Walkman.  It was golden. I was riding back home when i was struck with the terrible urge - I had to pee something fierce. \n\nThe only place open I could find was the laser tag place.  I locked my bike and asked the girl behind the desk politely if i could use their restroom. She handed me a key on a block of wood and pointed to the back of the shop.\n\nUpon finding the door, i realized that the key was going to be useless - the door was simply pulled to, not locked or even shut.  I knocked and pushed the door open when i heard no answer.\n\nWhat I saw froze me in my tracks, because while I'd heard of drug users before, I'd never laid eyes on a heroin addict going thru the preparations of getting high.\n\nI  have a small problem with drugs, having lost several family members to O.D.s over the years. You go to Christmas and ask, hey, where's Cousin Laura? And you find out she died two months ago in a hotel room. So you'll have to pardon my reaction to this guy.\n\nI grabbed this skinny asshole and bounced him off the walls in the bathroom. Dragging him thru the lobby of the establishment,  i looked up to see the girl watching me in shock.  I stopped and held the drug addict up.\n\n\"Excuse me, miss. Does the floor count as a wall?\" I asked her,  as if i were asking if such and such bus ran on the hour today. \n\nShe looked at me, 6 foot tall, 280 pounds, dragging some guy around like a sack of potatoes.  \"Uh, yes?\"\n\nThe guy tried to break my grip, and i needed to change said hold anyway, so i swept his leg and bounced him off the floor. \nI looked from him to her, smiled and said, \"Thank you.\", picked Druggie McDumbass back up and proceeded to throw him out the front door and into the gutter.\n\nI then walked back inside and took the piss that had graciously bided it's time while i dealt with other matters. \n\nWalking they the lobby on my way out, i saw the addict I'd just manhandled walking thru the door on his way back in. I stopped him and chased him off with the offer of a rematch. (Always willing to put the title on the line, that's me)\n\nI turned around,  preparing to tell the girl behind the counter that if she saw him in here again to call the cops. She didn't let me say word one.\n\nBL (BOSS LADY): My name's Jennifer, I'm the manager here. \n\nME: Oh. My name's 9k; sorry about the ruckus. (Yeah, I said ruckus.)\n\nBL: SO not an issue. Do you need a job? \n\nME: In point of fact, I do. Let's talk.\n\nI ended up as a \"Safety Marshal\", which meant I gave the orientation speech to players, walked around making sure nothing untoward was happening in the darkened, fake fog filled arena (ever been butt-stroked by a 16 year-old with a laser tag gun? How many parents have you caught having sex? And have you ever stopped a laser tag match, dragged everyone out of the arena, back into the briefing room and held 30 kids and a few adults hostage to find out \"which one of you little geniuses\" just tried to destroy the birthday girl's party?), and making sure that everything inside the lobby ran smoothly. \n\nI made $9/hr, which in 97 was nothing short of fucking miraculous, and it was a lot of fun, for my first security style job. In a career spanning 16 years, I have stories from bar bouncing, uniform security, loss prevention, and my favorite, \"Stand there, don't smile and tackle anyone who tries to steal something.\"\n\nEDIT: Smartphone touchscreens are a pain in the ass!\n",

        "text": "Back in the late 90s, I ran a security detail at an after hours nightclub. (10pm-8am no alcohol served)  Maximum occupancy 600, but sometimes I'm sure there were almost a 1000 in there.  \n\nEcstasy was just starting to get really popular and dealers were making 2 k a night selling overpriced E to stupid teenagers.  This incident happened on a typically busy Saturday night with a packed house. \n\nI noticed that 2 dealers were in angry conversation that was turning into a shouting match. As their gangs had already begun to congregate behind them, their confidence seem to grow and the confrontation was escalating from verbal to physical. I radioed for backup and before an all out brawl between the Cambodians and Chinese could break out over who's turf this was, I stepped in and physically separated about 6 guys who had began that stupid macho bs where they press their chests up against each other and try to stare each other down. I had my arms spread and was pushing 3 guys away from these other 3 guys trying to be intimidating. \n\nI physically held the apart till 2 more security showed up.  I told them to get the Chinese to the front entrance of the club and I told the angry Cambodian leader I needed to speak to him at the back of the club. Once I had herded his gang ( about 12 of them ) to the back.\n\nI patiently listened to their side of the story and feigned sympathy until finally another member of security showed up. Then I told them it was time for them leave. All of them. This was like pissing on an angry hornets nest. They all immediately began swearing and shoving to try to get back in the main club.  Meanwhile my partner and I just spread our arms and started shoving them out the back door. By the time we got half of them out, a bunch of them were grabbing and trying to hold the back door open so we couldn't close it between ejecting members and the rest were trying to rush back in. \n\nSince we were grossly outnumbered, even though my partner was 6\"2 220lbs while I'm 6\" 200lbs, and the Cambodians averaged 5\"2 100 lbs, we weren't making much headway.  There was a tangle of guys holding the door open, guys trying to shove their way in, and guys trying not be thrown out. Finally both of us grab the door handle and force it close with about 5 guys we wanted out still inside. \n\nI looked at him knowingly as I grabbed one guy and then nodded. He quickly opened the door and I threw the guy out as hard I could. It worked like a charm, knocking over a bunch of them like human bowling pins. As we continue ejecting them, my hands are full as I notice one of them cocking his fist way back to land a haymaker on me.\n\nIt was like it was happening in slow motion but I could do nothing to stop it.  I could see his fist wind up and swing and it was saying \" Dear Patchyo_Scratchyo, I am going to hit you now. Ok here I come. \" POW! He punched me as hard as he could...in my right ass cheek. I didn't know whether to laugh or yelp.  This guy was short even for a Cambodian and my ass was about shoulder height for him. His continued tiny flailing fists of fury were comically ineffective.  Once we finally got them all out I leaned against the closed door and told the other guy about Asspuncher and we both laughed until our sides hurt.  \"Watch out for Asspuncher\" became a running joke in the staff room before shift starts. \n\n**Epilogue**:  We kept the Chinese sequestered for little over an hour and ejected them from the entrance once the Cambodians had dispersed. A few weeks later I saw the one of the Chinese gang member getting pistol whipped to shit by another Chinese dealer across the street from the exit of our club.  When I heard a gunshot, I called the police but they never arrived to investigate. At least not within the 5 hrs remaining in my shift.  We started wearing bulletproof vests the very next weekend.\n\n**TL:DR:** Got my ass punched by tiny gangsters.\n\nCheck out my petty/pro revenge tales if you like my stories. I have lots more bar security stories if people like this one are are interested in hearing more.\n",

        "text": "They tell you when you work at a casino, to never tell people who visited and are currently playing there. I enjoy a good gamble once or twice a year and enjoy that privacy. But when I see someone come in every single month straight, it's horrible. You get to know these people who play, and they're so nice. They're kind, and you can't stop them. They seem happy, so why should I? \n\nI'll never forget this woman. Her name was \"Michelle\". She was amazingly gorgeous. A Doctor of Medicine. Smart. Beautiful. She even helped out on a medical emergency we had at one point saving a man's life. Yet, every night, she sunk so much money in slots it made me sick. \n\nShe always requested Security to be near her when she played, and we obliged, because she'd hit $20k jackpots at times and people would crowd. She called me the \"Bull Dog\" because I'd bark at people to leave. But I knew she was losing far more than she was putting in, and I slowly saw this woman with so much potential slip away. I fought off potential \"lovers\" for her, as she won big and they said they knew her, loved her, had kids with her (?) and what not. It was crazy, but She never turned her head, it was all on that slot machine. It was odd. She never batted an eye and I admired her for it. If I had that money, I'd be flashing it all over getting women. But she was hooked. \n\nThen it happened. \n\nI had to work the front desk for a couple of hours, which destroyed my back at the time and I'm supposed to be in shape. Had to be the shoes. But I see this well dressed gentleman walk inside the lobby with a kid. It's not against our policy to have a kid in the lobby, I just wanted to make sure he didn't bring a kid on the floor as THAT was against our policy. \n\nI approached him, tried to make my small talk of why he was at the casino at 3 am with a child no more than a year old. We got that a lot at the casino, and they usually shoved the kid on the other parent just so both parents could gamble. But this wasn't that time. That man held on to his child as if he wasn't going to let go for years. \n\nIt was a moment in my life that I can't forget. That man stood in that lobby and sobbed. It was tears that I can't describe. Holding his child, yelling at me how his wife was in the casino gambling all their money away. That they couldn't pay bills, rent, car payments. The money that they needed to have for their kid. And he said, \"Please, go find 'Michelle'. It was her. The woman I fought off men for. Watched carefully, as she dumped $100 bills in a machine one after another. The person that I thought had everything in the world to be able to do what she was doing. Right in the chest. Brick wall. \n\nWhat am I supposed to do? Lose my job and risk someone finding out that I violated a rule on customer's confidentiality? \n\nI did what I thought was best. I held his kid. Told him where he could possibly find a person he might be looking for in a very small high limits room. To go there, come back, and take his kid. \n\nI've told my future wife that I haven't held a kid before. That the first kid that I will hold will be our own. It's a lie. Although, I hope it is ok. I held that kid for 2 minutes. I never saw that woman again after that night. The next 2 years I worked there, not a sign of her. I'll hold any kid for 2 minutes again to possibly help someone in that situation. To get an outcome that we all hope is the one we are thinking of. \n\nThe small hourly wage doesn't prepare you for things like this. And that's the one of the times I've honestly sobbed driving home after work. I didn't ask for it. I didn't want to do it. Don't want to do it again. I just hope that family is ok. \n",

        "text": "-Setup\n\nI'm a normal small guy. Never have worked security before in my life, but needed a job. I was quiet and reserved. Went looking for a job and found that a casino in the area was hiring. I went to a job fair that they hosted, and gave three areas of interest, last being security. Of course, my first two options had long lines of interested people. Security, only one person. So they sent me there first. Talked with the manager and it went well. He told me I could carry a gun. For a 21 year old, I was shocked. That sounded fun. Next thing I know, I'm signed up for the state security qualification course and the test that weeds out psychos. I left without talking to the other managers. I was scared. I had no idea what I just got myself into. \n\n3 years later, I was a really good security guard. My size never went above 150. I found I could talk to people and make them do what they should. It was fun, and got cocky at times with other guards who armed up like a SWAT Team member. It wasn't necessary, and they just made issues worse. I got my gun one year in, but got to work outside. Total freedom to do what we wanted. Just scan the parking lot, put a dip in, and listen to good tunes. I got paid good, but I decided to leave after 3 years. \n\n-Story\n\nAfter three years, I'm done. Night shift destroyed my social life, and I was struggling in school. I had put my two weeks notice in 4 weeks ahead of time, and I had too much fun that last month. The supervisors loved me and knew I'd get the job done. I did everything I wasn't supposed to do, and had fun with the other guards. \n\nThis one night, we went to check the golf course. With my departure, they had a replacement ride with me and my partner to get the ropes. This replacement was someone who had been at the casino for 3 years longer than I had been. My partner had been there the same time as I had been. Going to the golf course meant a 45 minute break in a 13 hour shift. \n\nHowever, my replacement noticed a light on in a maintenance barn for the golf course that shouldn't be on, and a door open that shouldn't have been. The whole barn was surrounded with barbed wire and a single gate. Letting him get his cop fantasy out of the way, we walked around the perimeter and found nothing out of the ordinary. I thought that'd be enough, just write a report and be done with it. Nope. My replacement and partner wanted to go in and check it out. \n\nBefore I continue, both these guys are huge. 280 lbs plus. And being me, I had always joked with them about this. \n\nContinuing, they decided to get in. They said the would back the security truck up to the gate and hop over. I immediately started to confess why worry about this, but was instantly cut off by both of them with a couple of curse words. Fine. That's what I get for making fun of them for so long. I back the truck up to the gate, and being the athletic fucker I was, jump over in 3 seconds, not cutting myself on the wire. Those two guys, roll over it and plop on the ground. I laughed. \n\nWe went to check the open door. It was nothing. Really, nothing was there. Whatever, back to the truck. We get back to the gate, I climb the pole of the gate like spiderman, over the barbed wire, into the back of the truck. \n\nThey look at me as if they had just found out their wives cheated on them. As if they were victims of a ponzi scheme. As if the kid they thought was theirs wasn't. There was no way they could climb that 8 foot fence. I stood there in the back of the truck, and asked them, \"Do you remember when I was saying this might not be a good idea and you told me to shut up?\" Both of them said yes. \"This is why I thought it wasn't a good idea.\"\n\nFor about 10 minutes they scoured the area for a stool, a ladder, something to carry and put next to the fence. Nothing. I just sat in the back of the truck watching. For 15 minutes, they tried to get up that pole. They tried. Really tried. Desperation was showing in both of them. They never made it more than two feet up the pole. They had worn themselves out so bad, I was about to call EMS to check on them. \n\nFinally, I felt bad for them. I asked if I could help. They weren't happy about saying yes, but they did. Plan was I'd climb back over, help them up, and being the last one in would climb back out by myself. I struggled. I was weak. I used hands and my head to heave those fat asses over that fence. After 10 minutes of work, I got them over. I felt like I won the World's Strongest Man competition. We got in the truck. Vowed we would never talk about it again. I drove back to the casino. Dropped them off at the break room which ended up being a well deserved 1 hour break. My supervisor calls immediately after and wants to ride around with me and dip while he takes a break. Great guy he was. \n\n\"Hey Supervisor, guess what just happened!!\"\n\nWe drive down to the barn and I spotlight the fence. I don't get the right spot. The barbed wire was taught and straight. Drag the light to the right. There it was. Barbed wire stretched to it's limit because those two guys rolled over it. It looked as if Godzilla himself climbed over that fence. We had an amazing laugh. He got on the radio, called the two officers on the same channel, and told them next time something like that happens, to just call the fire department to bring the cherry picker out and not ruin the fence. They didn't talk to me after that. Then I left. \n\nI really enjoyed that job. My co-workers were fun. My supervisors were amazing. Management sucked so bad. Nights were horrible. I have tons of stories that my friends enjoy hearing from that place, both good and bad. This wasn't the best story, but it's the one I remember the best because it was the last thing I did. Hope you enjoy. ",

        "text": "First off, let me apologize for any formatting issues,  on mobile right now at, you guessed it, work. \n\nNow it is a fairly easy site, a HOA that really isn't a HOA, more upscale apartments that people buy and lease out to college kids. The site is right next to a university here in the states, so the apartments are always really easy to lease out to just about anyone. Dealing with the college kids, well that's a story for another time. But let's just say college kids who like to party and middle aged to old people don't really mix on the weekends. \n\nThis story though, this is about the wastefulness that the company I work for has for this site. I guess I should mention that the HOA managers get off on towing cars. To the point where if the security guard doesn't tow at least one car a night, well, we get an email chewing us out about it. To go along with this, I should mention that per the company's directive to us guards, we are parking enforcement that handles everything else on the side. Super fun, let me tell you. \n\nEvery weeknight, they have a driver deliver a stack of new paperwork to the site. This paperwork includes three excel spreadsheets printed out for us to use. One is the visitors permits logs, which are used to keep track of how many times a visitors permit has been used throughout the week. Another is a list of revoked resident permits, which have been revoked for who knows what reason, and which require an immediate tow if us security guards see it. The last is the violations logs, used to tell us which vehicles had been issued tickets for whatever reason throughout the lifetime of the place. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/9MageJQ\n\nThat is how much paper they use throughout a month (Smokes for scale because I didn't have a banana.) Its pretty ridiculous, in my opinion. You see, the logs get scanned, emailed to some guy in another country, who then puts them into an excel spreadsheet and emaiosnthat back to my supervisor, who prints it out to be delivered to us at the site. Now, if I actually cared, I would point out that the site phone is a smartphone, which we use to type up our reports and send in, and it would be much simpler, not to mention more enviormentally conscious, to just email us the documents and we would use the phone to look at them when we needed to. But, seeing as I'm leaving the site in two weeks, I'm not going to bother. I just can't believe that they are cool with wasting that much paper in a month... its crazy. \n\nI know this has already been long, but I wanted to add one more thing in before I go out for another tour. in order to verify that we are actually doing our rounds, they have us add an entry into our reports for each and every street sign, take a picture of it, and then send it in. I just... There has to be a better way. Hell, like I said, the site phone is a smartphone, galaxy s4 to be precise. Get some NFC tags, code them for each street sign and to add in an entry into the report on where I was and when, and boom, time saved. But nah, not that important. \n\n\nEither way, Hope you all enjoyed my little rant. I'm off to go walk around again. Thanks for reading!",

        "text": "[Background: *I work the night shift at a medium-sized hospital in the Midwest. The only entrance to the hospital between 20:00 - 06:00 is the ER entrance and there is a hallway that leads to the main hospital lobby.*]\n\nAround 04:45 I was called to the outside of the hospital entrance to talk with an upset visitor. *(She had called the main hospital number demanding to speak with whoever was in charge. Our operator thought it would be best I deal with it first.)* I'm on the other side of the hospital so it takes me about 5 minutes to get down there.\n\nWhen I got out there, I figured she was just confused about how to get in the hospital to visit a friend or loved one. No problem. It happens now and then and I'm more than happy to help them.\n\nNope. This is the tale of the self entitled witch (SEW):\n\n* **Me:** \"Good morning, ma'am. How may I help you?\"\n\n* **SEW:** \"The fucking door is closed.\"\n\n* **Me:** \"Yes, it's 5 a.m. This door doesn't open until 6 a.m. The after hours access door is in the ER.\"\n\n* **SEW:** *sigh* \"Whatever. Just do your fucking job and let me in.\"\n\n* **Me:** \"I apologize, but as this sign (points to sign) says, this door doesn't open until 6 a.m. for the safety of the patients. You'll need to use the ER entrance after hours.\" (literally 60 steps away)\n\n* **SEW:**  \"Does it look like I care? It's fucking ridiculous that I have to go all the way around (not that far from the elevators). Just let me in.\"\n\n* **Me:** \"I'm sorry you feel that way, but for the safety of everyone in the building, we limit access at night. You need to check in at the ER so that we know who is in the building.\"\n\n* **SEW:** \"Whatever. I'm not going to sit here arguing with a college drop out. You need to be more accommodating to your customers. Do you have any idea how much money I spend here? If you keep talking to me like this, I'll be having a chat with your boss and you won't have a job much longer.\"\n\n* **Me:** \"I don't care how much money you've spent here. That doesn't make you any better or give you any more privileges. I have been nothing but pleasant with you and I'm just explaining what our policies are and giving you guidance on how to get in at night. You can talk to my boss tomorrow, but he'll tell you the same thing I just told you.\"\n\n* **SEW:** \"I want to speak to him now. I might not have you fired if you apologize right now.\"\n\n* **Me:** \"I'm not calling my boss at 5 a.m just because you don't like hearing the truth and I'm not apologizing. I have work to do. If you would like to visit, you need to walk around to the ER and check in.\"\n\n* **SEW:** \"I'm not doing that. Just let me in the fucking door.\"\n\n* **Me:** \"Then you're not getting into the hospital tonight. You have two options: you can walk to the ER and check in, or you can leave. I don't tolerate people telling me how to do my job.\"\n\n* **SEW:** \"I don't give a shit what you like. Let me in the fucking door or so help me...\"\n\n* **Me:** \"Ma'am, I'm walking inside now and you won't be following me. I've given you your options. You need to make a decision. Have a nice night.\"\n\n[Conclusion: *She did call my boss Monday morning and told him that I called her a fat asshole who didn't have a right to be in the building and that I shoved her away from the door causing her to fall and hurt her ankle. Poor woman didn't realize we have fixed cameras on all entrances and when my boss said, \"Let me check the camera footage and get back to you,\" she quickly admitted she lied but she was just upset I was so mean to her.*]\n\nBefore you say that I should have take her information and just let her in, we have a policy for a reason. With the number of shootings and otherwise violent situations, I don't divert from the policy.",

        "text": "Of my two full-time jobs, one is as a security officer for a business software development campus. This morning a minivan pulled up to one of our security gates and the windows rolled down to reveal a little girl holding a tin of homemade cookies, complete with a big bow and a card that matched the color scheme of the cookies inside. The driver, her mother, said we always wave and say 'hi' to her whenever they drive by to visit her father and they wanted to bake us some cookies to say thank you.\n\nI went around to each gate and shared the cookies with all the officers on-duty today and everyone loved them: homemade sugar cookies with pink almost frosting in delicate little swirls. Simply delicious. It was obvious they had put some effort into the whole idea. Later on in the day, I decided I would call their father in his office on campus myself to ask him to pass along our thanks.\n\nEmployee: *(the line picks up but there's no immediately answer at first)* \"....Yeah?\"\n\nMe: \"Hello, is this [employee name]?\"\n\nEmployee: \"Yes.\"\n\nMe: \"Hello, sir, this is Officer [name] with Campus Security. How are you today?\"\n\nEmployee: *(~CLICK~)*\n\nNow I'm thinking *Did he seriously just hang up on me?* I wait for him to call me back since every phone on campus has caller ID and he can see what number to dial back. Nothing after a couple minutes. I call back and he lets it ring. I wait a while and call back, he lets it ring. I guess his kid inherited her manners from her mother because that's the biggest douchebag move I've ever seen from the employees who work here (and they're the most entitled and spoiled brats I've ever witnessed).\n\nSo I break out the email:\n\n&gt;\"Mr. [Last name],\n \n&gt;This is the security officer at the front gate who you just spoke with on the phone. As I was saying before I was cut off during our phone conversation, your wife and daughter dropped off some cookies for the security staff this morning. All of the gate officers had some throughout the day and they were very delicious. I wanted to ask you to thank them for all of us, who are very appreciative of the thoughtfulness of your daughter. Please tell [his kid's first name] that she did a great job making them.\n \n&gt;I would also encourage you to submit a service ticket to have your office phone equipment looked at since it dropped my call so abruptly and I was unable to reach you when I phoned back. I'd hate for your potential clients to be affected by your malfunction like I was. Thank you and have a good day.\"\n\nHe wrote back almost immediately that his phone won't let him pick up two calls at once and that's why he couldn't answer, ignoring the part where *he hung up on me to begin with.* Then he says he's glad we all enjoyed the cookies. Maybe he remembered at some point that you shouldn't piss off the people who provide you security at your own place of business.\n\nDude won't be getting his cookie tin back, that's for damn sure.",

        "text": "I am a current Loss Prevention Agent for a large chain of super markets, I go from store to store as I am needed and mainly target the boosters/fencers that have been hitting the various stores; but I also, of course, pick up any law breakers that I find along the way. Additionally, I wear plain clothes, not a uniform, while I work so I am normally able to blend in with the shoppers.\n\nAbout a week ago my partner and I were working one of our more ghetto stores looking for a guy who had been stealing copious amounts of meat but the store had been dead for the greater portion of the day and we were just about resigned to relaxing in our office all day since it seemed nothing was going to happen. Right as we were staring to get comfortable I noticed two young guys on one of our parkinglot cameras who appeared to be preparing to enter the store and I immedietly got one of those gut feelings that these kids were going to hit and they were NOT going to be cooperative when we stopped them. I switched to a camera inside the store, facing the entrance, and waited for the males to come inside; and sure enough, they did. One of the first things that I noticed upon closer inspection of the males, via the camera, was that one of them was wearing a drawstring backpack that appeared to be empty--an obvious red flag that further confirmed my belief that these two were planning to steal. My partner and I followed them through the store with our cameras and watched as they selected a couple of sodas and then began to head over to our liquor aisle. As they neared the liquor aisle they stopped at an endcap that had a few cheap bottles of liquor on it and one of the boys grabbed a 750ml bottle of New Amsterdam Vodka. \n\nNow neither of these guys looked old enough to buy the liquor so I immedietly left my partner to handle the cameras and went straight to the floor. As I rounded the corner to the aisle which the boys were on I looked at them just in time to catch the one that had been wearing the backpack dropping the bottle of New Amstrdam into the bag and then closing it up, thus concealing the bottle of liquor.  The males headed to the front of the store and paid for their sodas but not the liquor bottle, after which they made a bee line straight for the doors only stopping, ironically enough, to let me exit before them. \n\nAs soon as I had stepped out the doors and heard them step out behind me I turned around while taking my badge out of my pocket and introduced myself as store security which stopped the boys in their tracks. At first the males tried to play dumb but as soon as I mentioned the bottle in the subject's bag the guy holding the backpack took off running.\n\nNow my stores all have a hands-on policy in accordance with the state laws so I took off after the guy and ran around a pillar quickly cutting the subject off, so he doubled back and ran out into the parking lot with me hot on his trail. I reached out and grabbed the backpack and began pulling on it in an attempt to bring the guy down but he stuck his arms out behind him and shrugged the backpack off. I wasn't about to let my only action for the day get away from me so I dropped the bag and continued to chase after him. I quickly caught up with the male again and this time grabbed the back of his shirt and pulled hard. I heard the shirt rip and felt it give and for a second I thought that the shirt would rip off of him and he would escape; but it didn't. I wrapped up on the subject and we spun once before running into a parked car which sent us both to the ground, the male landing on top of me. I quickly rolled over on top of him and put his left arm, which I had control of, into an arm and wrist lock and began yelling at him to stop resisting. \n\nAt this point, the entirety of the time between the stop and me putting the subject in an arm lock had only been about 10 seconds and it was now that my partner arrived on scene and began helping me to subdue the subject. I had almost forgotten about the other male when I looked up just in time to see my partner ducking and then I felt a sharp pain on the right side of my face followed by the sound of shattering glass. Apparently what had just transpired was that the second subject had run over to the fallen backpack, removed the bottle of New Amsterdam, and thrown it at my partner who dodged it, but since I was directly behind my partner the bottle hit me in the face, causing a fracture in my cheek as I would later find out. The bottle, however, did not break on me, it instead bouced off my face and broke on the head of the subject which I was holding down. \n\nBlood immedietly began to spew from the subjects head as he continued to resist my attempts to place him in handcuffs. The second subject, who had thrown the bottle, then ran up and punched my partner in the head. This was the final straw for me, you can hit me all you want but the second you go after my partner you're done. I stood up and the man who had just hit my partner drew back his arm as if he was going to punch me. Before he could swing though, I delivered a quick jab to his stomach with my left hand and a strong punch to the jaw with my right followed by a leg sweep that sent the subject to the ground where I quickly rolled him over and was able to place him in cuffs while he was still dazed. By this time the police had been contacted by the store manager and were en route and two other male store employees had run out to assist us. I instructed the employees to hold the subject that I had just cuffed down and then I ran to help my partner. \n\nMy partner was still fighting with the un-cuffed subject who, without both of us holding him down, had gotten to his feet. I quickly gained control of his left arm while my partner had his right. I yelled to my partner to get his legs and we then performed a synchronized double leg sweep that dropped the subject to the ground HARD and knocked the wind out of him. From there my partner quickly placed the man in hand cuffs and the subject quit resisting right as the police arrived on scene. We handed custody of the two subjects over to police and from there were were checked out by an ambulance before writing our reports, giving statements, and dubbing video. \n\nAll in all we spent about 15 minutes fighting with both subjects, I sustained multiple cuts, bruises, scrapes, and a fractured cheek and the worst part is that I had to throw away my polo due to the ammount of the subject's blood that had gotten on it; it looked like I had been stabbed. As of today both subjects are still in jail and charged with robbery and given a $20,000 bail each. Additionally, one of the subjects had a warrant out for his arrest and now has about 8 other charges stemming from the warrant. Essentially, these two young men threw their lives away for a $13 bottle of vodka... nice.\n\nTL; DR- I was working LP and chased down a guy who stole a bottle of vodka, then I got hit in the face with the bottle and now the guys are in jail for robbery.",

        "text": "I work Loss Prevention in a big box retailer, I'm currently only working it once or twice a week because of a long story that has nothing to do with what I'm talking about right now.\n\nSo on one of my days a few weeks back, I noticed a group of ~5 suspiciously familiar looking subjects enter my store. I'm watching on camera and I see one of the ladies enters the shoe department, in a location that often leads to shoe switching. I inform the other staff of different departments to keep an eye on the subjects (because they had all split up) and gave them the descriptions and told them to tell me if they tried anything. \n\nI went to check on the lady in shoes but found that she had already left by the time that I had gotten over there, but on the way, I made contact with another member of their group, She had a cart with the largest available storage container filled to the brim with merchandise, most of which were duplicates. I know what she's doing with it so I speak with her briefly and professionally, making sure she know that I'm aware of what she's doing. I then go on my way to the front to make sure she doesn't try to push out.\n\nI see her leave without the cart or any other merchandise, so I head back to shoes and I find her cart had been abandoned. I know that she is with the other group so I take the cart and bring it to the front, (just in case she was just staging it for someone else to take it) and have the lane manager begin scanning all the items to give me a list of all the product numbers to include in my report. \n\nWhile he is scanning, a member of the group approaches us, the conversation went as follows:\n\nLady:\"Uh, did you find that in shoes?\"\n\n\"Yes mam I did.\"\n\n\"Oh, well that's my friend's, she just went to the ATM to get money to buy it.\"\n\nAt this point the lane manager looks at me, like he's asking me what I want to do. I tell him to continue scanning and I tell the lady that her friend will be able to find the cart of merchandise behind customer service should she come back for it (Spoiler: she didn't). The lady then goes back to her group. I keep a close eye on them, both by regularly following up with other staff, personally checking up on them and watching them on camera. The group then makes their way to the cash registers and pays for the remaining items and makes their way out.\n\nThe total for the items recovered was $1100.\n\nThe next day, my boss calls me in to finish writing the report (we had discussed this beforehand as I'm still kind of new and needed help with some of the finer details). I find out that she had made a similar recovery on the same group for $1500 that morning. I find out then that this particular subject has been boosting from our store and selling the stuff online. My boss pulls up the evidence from her online postings (which to be honest I'm not %100 sure how she had found)\n\nA few days later, I got a text from my boss saying that the booster had been arrested and there was a nice large stack of evidence including a DVD of video and pictures of both her in action in the store and the pictures from her dealings online with our merchandise ready for the police when they arrived.\n\nThere's more to this story currently, but it's a bit shadier and it's a current case so I'm not even going to think about sharing any of the details.\n\nI'm not a very good writer so if you need clarification on anything just let me know.\n\nOK, so the complaint came in the day after I came in to finish up my report. It started off as an \"anonymous\", \"experienced\" (whatever that means) shopper felt that she was being harassed by loss prevention while she was in the store, citing stalking, threatening gestures and accusatory remarks, none of which actually happened, I'm not sure what she was trying to accomplish, but me and my boss had a good laugh about it and it's been printed out and hung on our office wall.\n\nStay safe out there guys.",

        "text": "About five or six years ago, we had a record cold snap in the dead of winter, late december or early january if I recall. We hit around -50c for a few hours very early in the morning. The site was an apartment complex with some commercial space and a 6 level above ground parkade.\n\nThe building had 2 boilers for hot tap water, three for heating the building, and one smaller seperate boiler for heating the parkade. Two of the three building heater boilers had failed, and it took two to heat the building if the temp was -30c or below, so obviously the building wasnt being heated completely. Most of the building was just above freezing, some parts actually dipped below freezing. We gave space heaters to as many residents as we could, but other than that all we could do is maintain until the boiler repair techs showed up.\n\nInstead of staying at my post and doing timed patrols, I opted to hang out in the boiler room (where it was still warm) for 15-20 minues, then patrol the whole building, stopping to run taps and stuff so they don't freeze, and then repeat. I was in the middle of one of these patrols when i get a call that the parkade is very cold. Figuring this is nothing new, i continue my patrol and decide to pop in to have a look when i get there instead of going straight there now.\n\nAs i near the parkade, i got a call about gunshots being fired repeatedly in the parkade. Wtf, no way im thinking. The parkade is locked up, this is a upscale building, and why the hell would anyone stick around in the parkade today?\n\nI cautiously approach the door and listen. Silence. And then i hear a pop and metal clanging sound. Its loud and like a bang, but it is definitely not a gunshot. Im thinking someones slashing tires or something.\n\nI run inside and try to locate the source of the sound. Wow, it is really fucking cold in here.\n\nSuddenly, a sprinkler head pops off and slams into the ceiling with a bang and a metallic clang. And another. And another. Oh fuck, the pipes are rapidly freezing and bursting violently, thats the sound. I get the hell out of the parkade, running down the stairwell and checking every level. Its happening on all floors. No water leak at all, its freezing so rapidly the water is completely blocked. I spot one scared couple hiding behind their car and point them to the stairwell. I get down to the ground floor to check on the boiler and parkade attendant... and he isnt there. Dude must have decided to go home due to the cold. But he never told any of us, and he left all the big doors open. Sonofabitch. As a result the parkade boiler failed as teh pipe feeding it ran near the entrance and was the first to freeze. After that, i bet it didnt even take 10 minutes for the whole parkade to cool rapidly to sub 40 temperatures, specially since the intake vents were still running full blast. \n\nI close and lock up the parkade, shut off every pipe i can find going to the parkade call management, and wait a couple hours for the bursting pipes to stop.  I inspect the damage, its massive. Almost every single sprinkler head burst, nearly every exposed pipe split ( and nearly every not exposed pipe as well), ome of the sprinkler heads and pipe fittings had flung off at high speed and damaged parked cars. Dented hoods, roofs, smashed windows. All because some idiot decided he was gonna prop open some doors instead of calling me.",

I'd been working for this firm for about 5 years and though the pay was crap the work was reasonably reliable.  \n\nI get a call off my boss one day asking me to come into the office thinking it was about work for another site I didn't think much of it.  So I get there say hello to the receptionist and wait.  He calls me in and tells me that I'm fired and his just rehired me at 15 dollars an hour down from the eighteen I'd been getting paid previously.  His reasoning for this was that he business wasn't doing as well as it had been and he had to cut costs.  Well I was a little more than shocked and worried about how I'd afford my bills but I was young and stupid so I agreed to it.  \n\nAs I was leaving I saw my boss pull out in his new Mercedes and drive off down the road.  A couple of weeks later I landed another job with OT pay at a large company.  When I rang to tell him I was quitting he got really pissy that I wouldn't give him a months notice for him to find another guard to take my place.\n\nWould love to hear some of your stories about the dodgy stuff that bosses have tried to pull\n\n**TL;DR:  Boss cuts my pay without notice, get's pissed when I leave**",

I really liked working there I knew the owner personally and worked with him directly on a few occasions I guessed I must have impressed him somewhat because he started calling me for more important shifts than the event security that he had me doing at the beginning of the summer. One of the final sites he had me working on before I left for school was honestly the most pointless site I have ever worked.\n \nI had been working 12 hour nights in a variety of places and I loved them only 4 days a week to get full time plus 4 hours overtime seemed like a good deal the only problem was there was little consistency one week I would be somewhere the next I'd be somewhere wildly different well one week the owner gives me a call and asks if I want to work this new site he's just won he says it will be 12 hour nights indoors and ongoing for at least a month. I tell him I'm in no questions asked so he tells me I start there on Friday where the site is, a jewellery store within a mall and that when I call the supervisor to clock in he'll let me know what's going on but just as he's about to hang up he mentions I should bring something to entertain myself which I found odd coming from him he usually detested guards being distracted. \n\nSo I show up at the mall at 9 pm on Friday find the jewellery store and go inside to find the entire store is like a matchbox it was only like 10ft by 10ft with a small office and bathroom at the rear of the store. The manager of the jewellery store looks relived to see me she wishes me good luck for the night and begins to close the locking gate with me in the store I ask what is going on and she says for me to just call my manager and that there is a wash room at the back of the store she locks the gate and leaves. So fundamentally confused I call my supervisor go clock in and figure out what's happening he finally fills me in. \n\nThere was construction going on in the mall and there was a possibility that the alarm for the jewellery store was not operating nobody really knew whether the alarm worked or not and the company that owned the jewellery store decided to wait for the construction in the mall to finish prior to bringing someone in to check the alarm. So as a result I worked 48 hours a week for 6 weeks inside a locked mall which had its own guards while I was inside a jewellery store which was also locked and which it turned out had a completely functioning alarm but I can't complain I read asoiaf in its entirety while getting paid.",

        "text": "I'm an Account Manager for hi-rise facility in a major US City. I have had my fair share of experiences in this industry but I will never forget the time when \"Shuffling\" Reggie was kicked out of our lobby only to be met with a bit of unwelcoming electricity. \n\nShuffling Reggie had been off his medication for a few days. This is apparent when he likes to do cartwheels, talk nonsense, and just pretty much be a nuisance and a pain in the ass. He refuses to wear shoes, even going to the extent of trading shoes we hook him up with to what we can only assume he trades on some unknown underground black market organization that specializes in acquiring homeless men's shoes. Anyhow, Reggie refuses to wear a belt as well. Hence why he shuffles his feet while holding his pants up. Quite a character this Reggie.  \n\nShuffling Reggie was on a real good one on this particular day. Running up and down our elevator banks, screaming and cursing in the lobby for money, and just making the lobby smell wonderful with his welcoming presence. The beat cop that works the area is a great guy. Loves working in this city and is always looking to help us and other properties in his area out. In his last years of retirement, he works a beat that is relatively very quiet so he is always looking for a little bit of action out of his \"normal\" routine patrols. We were talking about a week prior to Shuffling Reggie's rant about how the department issued him a new patrol car along with a new taser gun that he \"has been itching to break it in.\" Fast forward back to present day of Reggie nonsense: I informed said officer that today we were having issues with Reggie and refuses to leave our area and keeps returning to our building. Officer wants to hang out and take care of the issue personally. \n\nPoor Shuffling Reggie. I managed to get Reggie out of the lobby. Only for him to go to the front doors out onto a public area and face the lobby, drop his pants, and proceeded to piss. I was just about to call said officer when Reggie was halfway through his business when he had a surprised look on his face and looked to his right. He attempted to run away with his pants around his ankles and his dorf in his hand when all of us that were watching saw with amazement Shuffling Reggie fall to the ground in a seizure-like-state and hit the ground like a sack of potatoes only for Mr. Officer to emerge from around the corner with taser gun in hand, a thumbs up to us, and a smile from ear to ear. \n\nThat was the first time I have ever seen someone tazed and it was glorious.

        "text": "A few years back I was stationed in a supermarket, walking the floor. The place was cheap and the only decent shop between two shadier parts of town, so some called it Chicago. \n\nIt was a Sunday, so I was alone, doing my thing, walking rounds around the place. \n\nI turned a corner and stopped just before actually going in the isle because all the alcohol was at the end of it, so I kept my actions discreet. \n\nFrom the corner of my eye I notice an older lady. She takes a product from the shelf, opens the bag she has in her trolley and takes out a non- clear plastic bag that she puts the product in. \n\nMy first thought was \"Reusing is cool, go lady\" but seconds later she puts the product back into her bag. Since she had her back to me, I quietly walked away. \n\nI don't know about other countries, but here my witnessing her taking the product and putting it into her bag gives me the right to ask her to the back if I don't see her paying for it at checkout. \n\nSo I walk around, keep my eye on thinks and when she starts heading for the checkouts I make my way over there, too. I push together some abandoned trolleys, lift some baskets to their proper place, pick up a piece of thrash and generally make myself look like I am not really paying any attention. \n\nThe lady gets to checkout, pays for her stuff and I do not see that particular product anywhere. So I wait for her to pack her stuff and approach her to ask her to the back to \"Clear up any confusion\". She seemed a little frightened and tried to leave, but I din't take no as an answer. \n\nSo we get to the back. I ask for her check and to lay out the contents of her bag. She had paid for bread and milk and some other stuff, but there were also crackers, candy, ham and all sorts of other stuff worth around 40 bucks (total guestimation). \n\n\"Busted\" goes trough my brain as I start going through the proper procedures. As I am filling the papers and waiting for the police, the lady starts telling me how she forgot all those things in her bag. \"Why did you put them in your bag in the first place, the stuff you paid foy you put in the trolley?\" And she goes on and on how she forgot. \n\nSince the police took about an hour to get there, she had time to beef out her story how she wanted to pay for the things separatly and whatnot, I had tuned her out by then. \n\nI handed her over to the police and went back to work. \n\nA few hour later the store manager came over with a smirk on her face. Turns out the lady called the store (happens very rarely here) and told the manager that she has gotten a fine. And now she thinks that it is only fair that I should pay for it, because after all it was all my fault. I should have told her that she had stuff in her bag, because she had forgotten. \n\nAll of my wuts. \n\nThe manager told the lady that she shoud pay her fine and not steal the next time and that I had done my duty exactly like I was supposed to. \n\nNever saw that particular lady again.

I'm outside, Vaping and enjoying my new [Aerotank and Apricot Juice](http://i.imgur.com/fnsoDmd.jpg) I knocked up before my shift.\n\nAnyway, this venue has a lot of police traffic; they usually come in for a coffee before the Friday and Saturday graveyard patrols in the CBD. Such was the case now with 3 officers having a coffee in the back. \n\nCue a random knob walking past from the right of my door. Looks around 50 and stick thin, but that's just the crack in his system taking it's toll. And it must have been some pretty mean gear, as he immediately takes umbrage of my presence, and especially my vape.\n\n*'What the fuck are you sucking on? You look like a dick, you want to suck a real dick cunt?'*\n\nDidn't bat an eyelid, this area has its fair share of Crackheads and junkies, so I didn't respond and just ignored it.\n\n*'Not talking cunt?!? You a dumb fuck as well?'*\n\nI continued my vape and lowered my arm to my side. He was getting a little too close now, and I had already had a junkie pull a box-cutter on me earlier in the week. The crack-head couldn't have been more than 50kgs dripping wet so a shoulder nudge would be all that's needed to unbalance him.\n\nThis crack-thing decided it would be a good time to whip out his smashed screen iPhone and try to start recording me, muttering obscenities in my direction. I turn around slightly to see if my fellow Bouncer had noticed this, but I only saw the three officers walking out. So I kept Vaping. \n\nHe continues muttering loudly and wobbly 'recording this cunt for YouTube' when the police walk outside. His demeanour totally changes. I look at the Sarge, just say that 'he's on the gear.' Cops motion him over, he tries to run *through* them, not away. \n\nNow Crackhead is carrying on in the back of the Meat-Wagon (large mobile police lockup) while I give details to police. \n\nI really like this Apricot flavour. I'm going to call it 'PJapricot' I think.\n\n*for Petty Justice, of course.*",

        "text": "A quick backstory: I work as \"second in command\" at a small part of the city. We have a lot of different things around, mainly a museum and a hotel for the rich and famous.  This occured a few days ago, and my boss is on vacation out of the country. Now, to the story:  \n\nI had barely sat down, enjoying a mediocre cup of coffee when I got some news from our employers. \n\n**Employer**: Hey Sayas! Just got news from the hotel. Some celebs are staying there tonight, he is on his way from the airport already.  \n\n**Me**: Well, crap. There goes the neighborhood. Who is it?\n\n**Employer**: Well, its some kid who is a pop-artist. \n\n**Me (Screaming internally)**: NOOOO! \n\nThis isn't the first time we have had younger artists staying here. It usually turns into a clusterfuck of another dimension when the fan club gets a hold of this.  \n\nI then call up my co-worker and bring the news. He isn't very happy about this, since he is the one patrolling outside, while I'm inside answering calls and E-mails. Yep, I'm that kind of security guard.  \n\nThe time comes, and I get the first call from my guy outside.\n\n**Co-worker**: Yeeaahhh, there are girls here already, making a stir. I gotta stay here until I get them under control.  \n\n**Me**: Do what you have to do, I'll tell Grumpy.  \n\nTo clarify, Grumpy is head of maintenance, or at least the outdoors of our little patch of land. He is always grumpy, unless I play with his dog, which he loves.  \n\nI go tell Grumpy, and sure enough, he gets pretty angry, before he heads outside to fetch some temporary blockades. My co-worker on the other hand requested me over there, as the girls (mostly 12-14 year olds) starter to get rowdy, and tried to rush the hotel to get a glimpse of the celeb in question. Luckily they were about 10 at this time.  \n\nI joined in outside, where the girls were less than polite to say the least. Cursing, calling us names and whatnot, trying to get under our skin. I wasn't phased about it, been there before, but my co-worker has a tendency to get quite irate when shit like this happens.  \n\nI cool him down, get him an energy bar and tell him that I'll try to get the hotel to order in some security themselves, as we can't cope with one man, and both of us have a lot of other tedious stuff to do. The hotel manager makes a few calls, and tells us that in 30 minutes, they will have a guy to take care of it. Great I thought, this means we can get back to what we are supposed to do. \n\nBoy, was I wrong. When the new guard arrives, the girls were now in bigger numbers, up to 30 at least. My co-worker had to stay outside to assist, while I frantically tried to juggle two phones, the main E-mail account for our maintenance department and the people living in our area.  \n\nI then got another call from my co-worker, simply saying \"**GET OUT HERE NOW!**\" I ran out, and sure enough, the girls took off in every direction, trying to get into the hotel. I took off to the main entrance, co-worker to the back, and the \"hired guy\" stayed at the blockade to manage the few girls left.  \n\nShit went south quickly. I managed to keep the girls out, but as ever, this really takes on physically when it stretches into hours. I get annoyed as well. I take a look around, and behold, my savior. Grumpy was rounding up girls by the dozen, and firmly sticking them back behind the blockades. He is a guy you don't want to fuck with, and he is not stuck behind a uniform, so he dosen't give a shit.  \n\nWhen the hours passed by, I had to tell co-worker that he had to stay another hour so we are two until the next guard arrives. He is not amused, but goes with it. Grumpy had now also recruited about 150 meters with police fences, so we had proper stuff to fence off the girls.  \n\nNow, queue the screaming, shouting, singing and other BS, when the celeb decided that it was a good idea to go out on his balcony, right over the blockade. That shit is so loud I could hear it in my office, 150m away, with closed doors.  \n\n4 PM came, and both my co-worker and I got off work. I told our evening guys about whats happening, and you could see their flashbacks to the last time we had this crap. They are going to have a good time tonight... ",

        "text": "*Disclaimer* Just found this sub and hopefully I'm not breaking any rules but I wanted to share this story...\n\nA few years ago I was working security at a high-rise office building in Denver and this specific incident happened bright and early on a nice Saturday morning in July or August. I'm not sure how familiar this sub is with Denver, but they have a pretty dense homeless population because the weather is pretty decent most of the year- this will come into play later in my story. The building was right downtown with all of the other office buildings, bars/restaurants, theaters, etc. that you would typically find downtown. This particular building also had an alley that let out right next to a small park which is always busy on nice days and is often used as a smoking section for employees of the various tenants. The property management company was always reminding the security team of how important the property cleanliness/image was to their clients because the rent was not cheap and they were paying for a professional atmosphere.\n\nMy shift supervisor had just completed a foot patrol of the interior common areas and so it was my turn to take the exterior patrol around the block and check on the various entrances into the building. When I was just about to round the corner into the alley (on the side opposite the park) my supervisor called me over the radio and let me know there was an unknown individual acting strangely in the alley near the park. As I rounded the corner I noticed an older Hispanic male standing on the far end of the alley near the park and from a distance I didn't immediately see a problem... until he pulled down his pants and squatted against the building. I didn't increase my speed because I didn't know how close I wanted to get to the male but I began hollering for him to stop, um, well to stop what he was doing. I don't know if he heard me between the sound of vehicles and other city noises but he completed his business with surprising quickness. He finally saw me walking towards him and quickly wiped himself clean with some bundled up toilet paper before he hitched up his pants and walked away. Because I wasn't supposed to follow people off-property I couldn't do anything but watch him walk away across the street and around the corner out of sight. \n\nAt this point I didn't know what could be done and my supervisor agreed that it would just waste the Police's time to file a report. The building didn't have janitorial services scheduled until Sunday afternoon and didn't have regular maintenance employees working the weekends so it fell to security to clean up the mess before regular business hours on Monday. I drew the short straw and had to clean up the mess with a shovel and some soapy water. Thankfully, that was the last time I had to clean up human feces... that year (but that is a different story).\n\ntl;dr - Watched a homeless guy poop near the park, had to clean it up.",

        "text": "Crossposted in /r/TalesFromRetail\n\nFor a short period of time (about a year) I worked as a security guard. The hours were nice as I have always been a night owl, there was minimal stress, and almost no contact with the public. I worked a few different posts until they stuck me in a gated community.\n\nI'm having a blast because I had just managed to purchase a laptop, and spent most of my nights writing. Once an hour, as mandated, I jump in the patrol vehicle and swing around the complex, which takes all of 15 minutes. The rest of the time I am sitting in the guard shack typing away.\n\nThe community also had a pool, which was right beside the guard shack, and I could look out and make sure nobody was using it after-hours. Most of the times it was people my own age, college kids that wanted to relax in the hot tub and drink. However, I returned from patrol and there was three couples in the hot tub, their clothes in a pile, and after a few seconds I realized they were all naked, and two of them were fucking. A short intervention and turning down an offer of a \"favor\", and I sent them packing. Had it not been for the apartment complex that overlooked the pool area, I may have reconsidered.\n\nHowever, what transpired to cause me to no longer have that sweet assignment had nothing to do with me.\n\nI receive a call on January 2nd, the morning before I was to show up for my shift, and it's my supervisor. He's exasperated, as apparently a resident of the community witnessed me handing out bottles of beer to underage kids on New Years Eve, and setting off illegal fireworks. My first response was *\"I'm barely covering my expenses, what makes you think I would give alcohol to anyone, much less someone underage?\"* my supervisor was still pissed and bitching at me because apparently our contract to cover the community had been terminated due to the incident.\n\nThen I realize something. I realized that I hadn't been working on New Years Eve because it was on the weekend, and I had the weekends off (namely because there were quite a few people willing to work the weekend, but unable to work weekdays). So I ask my supervisor *\"Take a look at the calender and see what days I'm normally scheduled.\"*\n\nI waited in silence for about a minute, and he replies with *\"Oh, shit, I'm sorry. Come into the office and we'll set you up with another post.\"*\n\nAfter showing up to the office around 4pm, I'm given another post which had recently opened up, another gated community. The moment I show up I realize things are a little different, as it's a 2-man post. Right after I get there, the senior guard takes me on a tour and tells me that I'm to show up 15 minutes before my shift begins, but not to clock in until my shift. I figure that I'll just leave early since apparently the shift begins 15 minutes early and ends 15 minutes early.\n\nThe second day I crack open my laptop to begin writing, which is also where I keep my post logs, so I can print them all up and hand them in at the end of the week, and they look amazingly better than the chicken scratch of other guards. I just finish writing a paragraph, and the senior guard walks over and closes my laptop, and says *\"No, you will not be playing video games on the job.\"*\n\nI shrug, as the internet hadn't taken off, and I figure he's just technologically illiterate. When I go to leave early, as I had showed up 15 minutes early, he curses at me and starts calling me lazy. I'm puzzled, but too tired to deal with him, so I wait the extra 15, clock out and go home.\n\nI show up the prescribed time the next shift, not the 15 minutes early, and the guy is livid. Granted I probably have 20 pounds and 40 years on him, but he starts getting in my face about being disrespectful and such. I just shrug, figure I'll have a talk to the superiors the next day, and be reassigned.\n\nThe next morning rolls around, and I get a phone call about how I was being disrespectful to a \"senior officer\" (to which I chuckle, as we're all low paid security guards), and that I was to follow his demands and stop playing video games on duty. I explain my side, and request a change of post. They reply with a *\"No, you're going to continue working that post.\"* My response was that they will assign me a new post and contact me when they have it arranged. For $1 more than minimum wage I wasn't willing to put up with much if all the perks were gone.\n\nSo, I wait for a week, and then go get a job doing telemarketing. I hate the job, but it keeps the bills paid for awhile.\n\nAfter a month I hear nothing from the security agency, so I figure I'm terminated. Not long after I run into a fellow security guard who had been in the office when the superiors were discussing me, and their statement was *\"He'll come back and work that post when he gets hungry.\"*",

Anyway after showing the two of them what to do they decided that it would be fun to stand on the ledge and screw around standing on the ledge and play fighting.  Anyway I told them to stop it etc and they kept it going.  Obviously I called my boss when they left and let him know what was going on and they didn't work there again.\n\nSo after remembering this I was kind of thinking what are some of the more stupid and dangerous things you've seen other guards do?\n\nTL;DR\nStupid traine guards decide a ledge 12 storys off the ground is a good place to fuck around.",

        "text": "Honey Jack Daniels, Coke, four cubes of ice, chilled glass.\n\nI feel a little better, and a little worse.  I'm eating manwich right now.  It's good.  It's cheap, but, it's good.  Got a gallon of ice water I can soak my brain in after the jack+coke is gone too.  A drink really helps.  It helps me unwind, and not want to get stupidly emotional about things.\n\nAlcohol.  It keeps me stable.  Go figure.\n\nI get to work.  Saturday.  Today, even.  I work at a Doctors Office, to keep Jackasses out of the building, off property, and stop them from being jackasses.  It's a never ending job, but Saturday is my 'Let's read Reddit all day' day.  Easy.  Few problems, in theory.\n\nThere's a gentleman I work with at the office.  Let's call him: \"El-Hombre\"  He's a receptionist, and he pings my gaydar like a sidewinder target lock.  He's cute, he's sweet, he's very, uh, fabulous.  But, he's a great guy, and I've yet to have an issue with him.  I'm in the lobby, a patient is at the window, and there's a privacy wall so that others can do their stuff.  I respect HIPA, HIPPO, Whatever it's called, and I keep a distance.  Who is stupid enough to fuck with a fatass security guard that looks like he was a lineman in high school?\n\nHint: I was.\n\nEl-Hombre turns around to make copies of the information of the patient.  Upon turning back around, he finds that his music playing cellphone (iPhone) is gone.  So is the patient.  The patient who just filled out a patient information sheet.  A patient who filled out information for himself and his daughter with all contact points filled out.\n\nEl-Hombre let me do the police report.  I got to play on a company computer.  Yay!\n\nSo at 1530, it's cool again, report is filed online, and I'm behind the desk, derping around on my phone when I see this other gentleman come to the desk.  He leans in, kisses El-Hombre, and my Gaydar has a lock, fires it's missile, and blows open the whole: \"Gay?  Straight?  European?\" thing wide the fuck open.\n\n\"We have Gay, I repeat, we have Gay!\"\n\nThe kiss is pg.  For you across the pond, it means it's chaste, lip to lip, less than three seconds.  It's adorable, and it makes me happy.  I tell El-Hombre that his boyfriend is /adorable/.  He blushes.  He's cute when he blushes.\n\nUntil Scraggy Old Bitch (Also known as SOB) comments with a rude 'ew' sound, then starts in that it's highly inappropriate to do that in public.  It's the same kiss that I've seen married couples give (quick peck on the lips to signify affection, no tongue, hands not even touching), and I've heard not a word.\n\nSo, for those who don't know me, I don't like bigots.  In third grade, I stood up against a teacher during the \"blue eyes experiment\", where to demonstrate the affects of bigotry to the classroom, those without blue eyes had to do whatever the blue eyes said, blue eyes eat first, drink first, can do anything they want, etc.  I was the only student to stand up and shout (yes, SHOUT!) that: \"THAT IS WRONG AND I WONT DO IT!\".\n\nI made a teacher cry.  A happy cry.  I understood.\n\nDigressing.  Sorry, I'm drunk.  \n\nShe says other things.  Things that make this bear's blood boil.  She makes... well, let's say she proved her bigotry with more words than just that, okay?\n\nI tell her, in a more polite format: \"Shut.  The.  Fuck.  Up.  You can either keep your mouth shut, or keep your mouth shut outside.  If you open your mouth, you will be removed, and you will no longer be a patient here.  Now.  What'll it be?\"\n\nSo I'm getting a formal complaint against me.\n\nI called my boss.  I told the ornery bastard that I stood up for an employee, and that I don't tollerate bigots, period.   I told the guy I stood up for that: \"If I get fired, I get fired.  I stood up and held my honor.  I can get another job.  I can't get destroyed honor\".\n\nI'm really drunk.  I need more. \n\nSo I've got a formal reprimand coming.  I'm okay with that.  I did my duty.  I held my honor.  I shut a bigot up.\n\nI'm applying for another job.  I'm tired of security.  I shouldn't have to defend myself against an SOB.\n\nSo how was your day?\n\nWant some J+C?",

For info I work in quite a large club in England, we have 2 big entertainment halls (about 4,000 max capacity) with different club nights and/or gigs most nights of the week and a bar that holds about another 1,000 attached. It’s a pretty lively place to work and keeps us busy as you could imagine.\n\nSo by way of a short introduction, this night was a drum and bass special. So lots of [gobby]( http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/gobby) teenagers and students and not an insignificant amount of drugs floating around.\n\nIt's quietening down on the doors as most of the customers are inside now and I'm dealing with a rather irate gentleman in front of me when a skinny kid comes wandering towards the door from my left. \"Hang on a second there mate and just wait til I sort this fellah out.\" I tell him. He seems quite happy to comply with the request, so I keep my focus on the guy in front of me and just watch the kid out of my peripheral vision.\n\nWe finally convince the first man that he wasn't getting his drugs back or getting into the event, but he could happily wait for the police to turn up, if he really wanted to get us arrested for theft and get his property back, but he decided he better things to do. I turn to the kid who has been patiently queuing up to get in. All the while my susconscious had obviuosly been observing and passed a short note up to my forebrain telling me to check this kid out. However it didn't take long to see why he'd flagged himself up.\n\n\"Have you had any drugs tonight pal?\"\n\n\"Nah mate, I don't do shit like that.\"\n\nThe kid was stood there with the biggest, happiest smile on his face I have ever seen on a human being. The word beatific springs to mind looking back on it. This is what people will look like when the rapture happens.\n\n\"So you haven't had any ecstasy tonight?\" This question seemed a pretty safe bet to me. He was rubbing one hand around his belly in circular motion, the way you would when you've just eaten the best meal of you life and the second hand was complemantraily stroking his chest, all the while doing a slow serpentine swaying of his body. Man he was really getting into it, I could see he was getting some real tactile enjoyment right there. High as a fucking kite.\n\n\"No\"\n\n\"Are you sure, cos you look pretty damn happy right now?\"\n\n\"Well maybe a little\"\n\nWell I didn't expect him to break this easily under interrogation, I hadn't even had to start playing mind games with him and accuse him of lying yet. \"Well come and sit down on this wall and wait til the rush subsides.\" We have a zero tolerance policy for drugs so he was not getting in.\n\nAnd so began an all night game of what we like to call pong, that we play with the bar attached and the other venue.\n\nBar: \"That kid from the drum and bass night you knocked back has just been turned away by us.\" \"Bok\"\n\nVenue 1, 5 minutes later: \"He's just been bounced on by us.\" \"Bok\"\n\nBar: \"And bounced by us again, looks like he's on his way to you venue 2.\" \"Bok\"\n\nAnd lo, he wanders up to us with no recollection of having been turned away or even being here earlier. \"It must have been some other bloke that looked like me.\"\n\nThis goes on until people start leaving and he finds a similar soul to get in a deep conversation with until kick out time, when his friends appear asking where he'd been all night.\n\n\"Mate, I feel awesome, I've had the best night ever, let's go that after party\"\n\nTLDR: Kids, just say no.",

We have to have the word \"security\" clearly visible on the back of our normal uniform shirts, as the peace officers don't have any writing on the back of theirs and therefore from behind it's easy to mistake us for them. Makes sense.\n\nWhat does my company do? get the shittiest vinyl lettering on the back they could get. Seriously it feels like fucking iron-on stuff. It looks ok.... until you wash it for a few months. I've had my uniforms replaced once already not too long ago because of this issue.\n\nFast forward to today, a new guard who just transferred to my site is missing damn near all the letters off his back. This confuses me as he is a stand up guard in every other way. I straight up tell him to stop into main office and get himself new uniform shirts.\n\n\"i already did\" he tells me \"they told me no\"\n\nwhat.\n\nI call the branch manager. He tells me that a lot of guards have been getting replacements over the last couple months, they didn't anticipate going through this many uniforms so fast. They are completely out of all sizes of uniform shirt, except for a handful for new hires. They JUST put an order in for new ones. we're looking at a 2 month wait.\n\nLet me get this straight. You buy the shittiest lettering you can find, find out after the first month that this shit wears out really fast with normal use, and you didnt' anticipate there'd be a problem at some point when EVERY FUCKING GUARD IN THE COMPANY HAS THEIR LETTERING FALL OFF AT THE SAME TIME. God damn it.\n\nTheir solution? \"just tell him to wear his jacket\"\n\nYeah. Wear his jacket. In the fucking summer.",

I was working the door a couple of days before Christmas checking bags and wishing the end of the day would hurry up when this woman came past leaving the store with 5 or 6 bags in tow.  I told her that i would need to check and all of a sudden there was this almightily screech \"THERE IS NO WAY YOU'RE CHECKING MY BAGS YOU UNDER EDUCATED RENT A COP.  I JUST FINISHED SHOPPING HERE\".  Anyway after explaining store policy etc and more screaming I basically told her that enough was enough she either showed me her bags or never came back.  She ended up dumping all of her purchases over the floor and said now check them.  Needless to say she wasn't allowed back in the store\n\nTL;DR\nCustomer flips out about bag checking, gets banned from store.\n\nEDIT:  Legally a customer can refuse but the store has the right to refuse entry.

        "text": "Since people seemed to like the last one, here is another story about my time working crowd control for a pro baseball team.\n\nBag checks were a part of the routine for getting everyone into the park and one day I was stationed at the busiest gate for bag checks. There is a huge sign over the gate proclaiming \"All Bags Must Be Checked\". Below is a list of what is not allowed. Liquor, weapons, drugs, metal or glass containers, animals. (I thought they were being paranoid about the animal thing but apparently the year before someone snuck in a live cat and threw it on the field.) It was extremely common for women to try to sneak liquor into the park in their purses since the prices were so highly inflated inside.\n\nIt is the peak of the pre-game rush and there is a line at least 50 deep for the bag check. The line moved fast and it didn't take more than 10 seconds for most bags. Still, the ticket takers continually had to redirect people to our line.\n\nThis one woman with a huge purse blows by our line, ignores the massive sign, and gets stopped by the ticket taker. She continues to ignore the line, struts up to me, and sticks her bag in my face. \"Check my bag\" she demands. I finish checking the bag I was working on, look up at her, and point down the long line. She huffs and puffs  saying it will take just a moment, but I ignore her and check the bag of the next person in line.\n\nShe stomps off to the back of the line and death glares at me. After about 5 minutes she is back at the front of the line. SHe makes some kind of snotty remark like \"*NOW* can you check my bag?\" I immediately feel something hard at the bottom the bag and pull out a fifth of rum. I tell her she can't bring it in. \n\nShe takes the bottle and stomps off again. I see her off in the crowd chugging the bottle. I flag over a supervisor, point her out, and have him wait nearby.\n\nShe tries to blow past the line again and I send her back to the line again. She gets through the now significantly shortened line in a minute. She shoves her bag in my face again. My supervisor steps up and asks to the her ticket. He then informs her that we saw her drinking heavily and believe her to be too intoxicated to enter the park. He then walks off with her ticket.\n\nShe tries to argue but after an order from the police officer that hangs out at the gate, she wanders off defeated.",

        "text": "Relatively long story, but this sub is pretty quiet. The setting is that I work as a bouncer for a bar in a quiet town in the north of England, around half an hour away from the city my university is in.\n\n\nThe door staff (5 of us) were invited on a staff night out, which was a leaving do for one if the managers of the bar I work at. I had an exam the next day, at 9am, so I only intended to stay for a few, and then be on my merry way. In what was going to be my last bar, a couple of gentlemen started a fight with the other door staff and myself (simply because they weren't fans of people in our line of work), which ended quite quickly, with no damage being done.\n\n\nObviously, after this, I was pretty amped, and decided to stay for one more, stop at a mate's, and return to uni on the first train the next morning. The following involved completely different aggressors, the previous account being just a little bit of scene-setting.\n\n\nHOWEVER...\n\n\nWe went the bar we all work at around 1am, as a finisher for the night. While I was standing at the bar, beer in hand, laughter flowing, someone ran in from the loo telling me it was kicking off in there.\n\n\nRan in, saw one of our door staff getting set upon by 3 lads. Stormed in, dragged one off him, and a few other guys had followed me, and helped out. Got all them out of the bar, after plenty of grappling etc. My guy was the last out, and when I threw him out of the fire exit, I looked to the main door to see one of them smashing it in with a fucking sledgehammer. I shit you not, a fucking sledgehammer. Got everyone inside, locked the door, and they started smashing that in. Glass fucking everywhere. Realised that two of our guys were still out there. Despite the manager's protests, I ran back out to grab them, and succeeded. Came back in, saw one of them still inside, kicking off and trying to open the door to get out. Obviously, we couldn't open that door and let in MC Hammer, so I took him to the ground, pinned him (causing him to literally cry for his mother), tried to calm him down, and waited for the police, keeping a close eye on the window smashing going on behind me. Eventually, the police came, and the only one who was hurt was the initial instigator in the toilets, who'd been knocked out.\n\n\nAfter giving statements to the police, and writing up incident reports for the company we work for, I eventually got home at 7:30am, showered, and went to my exam. Not the greatest exam prep ever. Needless to say, I finished the 90 minute exam in around 15, and went home to a well-earned rest.\n\n\nFinally got a bouncer story, and I wasn't even working.\n\nEdit: actually, it isn't that long. It just looked it in the preview.",

A lot of their fans would drive in for the game so it was a full house.\n\nIn my section there was a large bus group that were all fans of the visiting team.

One guy was apparently too drunk to notice that the numbers were swaying against his favor. The game ended and he was the lone visiting team fan in the section. He decided it was a perfect time to do some shit talking.\n\nPretty quickly the crowd turned on him. They started throwing trash at him and pushing towards him. I could see one guy getting right in his face. I screamed at the next CC guy over to go get help and he ran off.\n\nI started plowing through the crowd shoving people left and right yelling \"Security, coming through.\" I get to the center of this circle and shove the home team fan back.

He showed me how to operate the alarm system and etc.  This was around 2003, the time when a lot of malls overseas were getting shot up and bombed.  However, this was in bumfuck Wisconsin.  Later that day he took me on my first lot patrol, and we came across a \"suspicious package.\"  It was a large suitcase.  I asked if we wanted to call the bomb squad.\n\n\"What you have to understand is, that if you called in the bomb squad for every suspicious package here, they might as well live here.  You have to check it out yourself first.\"\n\n\"Well how do we do that?\"\n\n\"Like this!\"  He ran up to the suitcase and kicked it while I nearly shat myself.  Of course nothing happened.  He confessed he had put it there to mess with me, but teach me a lesson about calling the bomb squad.\n\nSo, years later, working for bigpharmaco, I was recognized as one of the few competent and educated guards.  So, they sent me out for training to be on their new \"bomb threat response team\" or \"inept bomb searchers\" depending on who you asked.  In that training I learned what a bomb looks like.  Literally anything.  The teachers demonstrated how you can easily put a bomb in a paper bag and no one would question it.  Put it in a lunch pail in the fridge, a kfc box, whatever.  What we learned is how screwed we would really be in a real situation.  \n\nSo, months later, I am called to respond to a \"suspicious package\" near one of the gates at bigpharmaco.  It was a bright pink kid's Dora the Explorer  rolling luggage suitcase.  My \"rival\" had called it in, and he was always very flighty, anxious, and nervous.  He had the tendency to make incidents blown out of proportion.\n\nThe thing was, earlier that day, I had a pass down about that suitcase.  A lady had left it when dropping her kid off to her ex husband in a custody thing.  She was supposed to come back for it later.  However, I realized my \"rival\" didn't know this.  Before I exited my truck, I called my buddies in control and told them the package was okay, but to put the camera on us for giggles.\n\nYou see, I still remembered my first day in security years ago, and wanted to pass on the lesson.  I went out to talk to \"rival\" and told him with as much bravado as I could muster \"I'm on the bomb team, watch and learn.  Turn your radio and cell phone off so we don't accidentally activate a bomb.  I'm going in.\"  I could barely hold back my smirk.\n\nSo, I went over and gave Dora a swift kick, then violently opened the luggage.  He gave a yelp and \"What the fuck do you think you're doing!\"  Laughing, I calmly gave him the whole story, waved at the camera, and told him to smile for the guys in Control.",

So here's anold one from my greatest hits.\n\nThe site: high end appartment complex in the heart of downtown. Near many club venues. Ive mentioned it in other stories. Out front is a bus shelter. Its a saturday night. A conference centre nearby just let out some pop concert for a band popular with preteens. I cant remember the band, not important.  At this time theres also a sort of electronica/rave event going on simultaneously. In the same building. Whoever planned that was an idiot. \n\nI get a call from the venue security. They were always nice enough to give surrounding buildings a heads up when they planned to eject people en masse. The rave was getting out of hand, they were aboiut to shut it down under direction of police. Out on the street were still many preteens and some of their parents, including a whole bunch waiting at the bus shelter. Great, just great.\n\nVenue security starts booting people out. A few cops are on the street to disperse the crowd out and away quickly, which is typical. But this crowd is rowdy, the cops back off to wait for a crowd control unit. Im a little down the street, so im not catching most of the crowd, but i got a few rowdy idiots banging on windows and throwing stuff on my side of the street. I decide to bend the rules a bit, I go out front and usher all the preteens and families into my lobby before it gets out of hand. A few opt to stay outside and wait for the bus, at first. \n\nAfter not too long, some idiot starts smashing the windows of the bus shelter, which still has a few kids inside. This guy looks like a pretentious nut, white suit jacket with black pinstripes, black fedora, skinny jeans, whispy goatee, maybe 5 foot 6. I run out there and start yelling at him, getting the attention off of the kids and onto me. The kids are smart enough to take the hint and get inside.\n\nCourse this puts me in a hell of a dangerous position. I can handle this guy easy enough,  but we got a riot going on here, and all the crowd sees is a lone uniform arguing with one of their own, so a few more people start to converge on me. I back off to my door, keeping my back to it, but not wanting to open it for fear they'll rush me and get in. A few things getting tossed at me, but theres still a small number of them focussed on me, and the original guy goes back to smashing the bus shelter. Im able to keep the other guys at bay and keep them arguing verbally for the most part until finally the riot cops show up, thankfully they come from my side of the street. I use the distraction o get my ass back inside and lock up behind me. One of the rioters i was facing off against throws a stone at the cops, and they put him down hard. Very satisfying to watch. Took about an hout for the cops to break everything up. Luckily my building suffered no damage aside from the bus shelter, but lots of broken windoiws all around that night.",

I do what my boss tells me.\"\n\nTo which the ~~dumbass~~ lady replies:\n\n\"Oh.  That's what the Germans said after world war two, you know.\"\n\nNow, I'm ~~hardly~~ known for being professional on my job, but I had trouble keeping a straight face.  I coughed, and asked her to clarify if she was calling me, a security guard, a Nazi.  She said that she was not, but that my answer was very... uhm... Nuremberg-esque.\n\nYet, funnily enough, when I asked her if she herself had ever had a job, she took an almost offended expression, and said that, no, indeed she ~~was living off daddy~~ had never had to work.\n\nShe was quite angry when I laughed at her, and gestured for her to get her things and get out.  I received a call from my manager a few hours later about the incident, and asked why I kicked her out.  To which I told my boss:\n\n~~\"I KNOW NUZINK!\"~~ \"She was harassing an employee, and was beginning to loiter.  Also she called me a Nazi.\"\n\n...And that was just the start of an 11 hour shift.\n\n~~I need a drink~~ ",

        "text": "\"How do you shut off the water in the building?\" is the question I was posed when I answered the phone.  At my post, i am also the night operator.  It's a little private med school, and this lady was calling from her dorm.\n\nAs a private med school, we get lots of wealthy folks from abroad.  We have very nice apartment style dorms, but they are still technically dorms with private bathrooms and kitchens.  This particular lady was from eastern europe, and very wealthy.  The new students had just moved in that week.  Here is the conversation as best I can remember, it was about 5 years ago.\n\n\"Campus Security, how may I help you?\"\n\n\"Yes, I need to shut off the water in the building, how do I do that?\"\n\n\"What? Huh?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have some contractors here, they just finished installing my counters and floors.  Now they are putting in the bidet, but they need to shut off the water to do so.  Where can they do that?\"\n\n\"Umm, you can't.  I don't think you are allowed to do that in your lease.\"  I put her on hold.\n\n\"Duty Engineer from security, are you aware of contractors working in [dorm building].\"\n\n\"Negative Base, what's going on?\"\n\n\"A student apparently is trying to install floors, counters, and a bidet.  She called to ask how to shut off the water in the building.  You might want to get over there.\"\n\n\"What?  En route, thanks base.\"\n\nI picked the phone back up.\n\n\"Miss, I have an engineer en route to assist you.\"\n\n\"Great!  Thanks!\"\n\n\"No problem.\"\n\nTurns out she was allowed to keep her floors and counter, but when she moved had to pay to have the originals reinstalled.  This lady was filthy rich, so it didn't matter to her.  Very nice lady, though a little clueless.",

Since I am the de-facto supervisor at the moment, naturally the place is in disarray now that Im back. keys missing, unfiled paperwork, etc.\n\nIm sitting at my desk and the coffee shop staff in my building tell me there's some guy leaning over the counter, using their sink after they told him not to as it's a contamination issue. I approach the guy and tell him to stop doing that, he says he wasn't using the sink, they are just getting him some water. I call bullshit since I just watched him pull his hands out of the sink, wet.\n\nHe gets uppity \"you calling me a liar\" etc, so I tell him he should leave. He goes to \"get in my face\" and i shove him back to arms distance, just palm of my hand to his chest. Then he turns, walks back over to the sink. I spot a rather large folding knife on his belt. Probably a 4\" blade. Before following him I lean over to the clerk and say call police, then point to the knife and make a phone gesture with my hand.\n\nI walk back up to the guy and tell him to get out or face trespassing charges, and police are on their way. The guy starts gathering his stuff, but then decides, no. He's gonna be an asshole. He turns around, starts threatening me \"i know where you work, you're here every day\" blah blah.

        "text": "So recently shit is going down at my site. The site is a notoriously difficult client to please, simultaneously wants nothing to do with security, yet anytime he becomes aware of a situation we handled he gets irate and wants us to do it differently. whatever.\n\nAnyway, the previous guards posted here were... the b squad. A dude who gets too excited and panics, a creepy guy who hits on every young woman, an old man, and a dude who likes to sit with his head down and earphones in all shift. Oh yeah, this is a high traffic, highly visible post.\n\nSo myself and another guard who I'll call K were pulled off our sites and sent here to take over during business hours, in the hope of salvaging this site. K is the supervisor, and rightfully so as she has much more experience than me. Things working pretty smoothly, K setting policy and working the day shift, and enforcing proper reporting from the night and weekend guards, and me taking the evening shift and dealing with most of the bans and physical security issues. The tenants and guests of the building commented frequently on how much security has improved with us there.\n\nOne problem: Management hates K. We don't know why. She is fairly confrontational, however the tone they take with her on everything, literally every issue is very confrontational. They don't take this tone with me or the other guards, so we can only figure they dislike her specifically. Recently K warned me that she might have to transfer out, which would likely leave me in charge by default. No one else makes sense as the supervisor. However, it's not her call to make, it's the main offices.\n\nOn Monday this week, our regional manager calls me in a panic and  tells me to take over for K. He says this is temporary, she's on a leave of absence. Ok, fair enough.\n\nI text K, just to get a few details of her duties and see if anything major is up. She says she doesn't know. She's supervising a different site now. She literally has no idea if she is going to return.\n\nI email the regional manager basically saying \"look, is she coming back or not? Am I the supervisor now\"\n\nHe won't answer. all he'll tell me is that she's on a leave of absence and to handle her shift.\n\nGod damn it dude. I need to know who's in charge. Do I leave these approvals until she gets back, or do I sign off on them? Is the person handling my shift a temp, or should I arrange long term training? Do I have any authority? are we getting a new supervisor? I need to know these things, we can't run a post headless like this. Just fucking answer the question.",

        "text": "Hello all,\n\nI figured I'd post another story from my days doing patrol work. This one comes from a Suburb with a very large police force (relevant later), and a site that I had to fill in at for a single day.\n\nFirst off, the site itself was super basic. It's a strip mall in a suburb, with an enclosed area to make it feel more like a \"real\" mall; and at one end of the giant L shape, there is a grocery store (for those of you outside the US, this is a giant suburban grocery mecca, the average store from this chain is 68,000 square feet of foodstuffs). The shift is simple, start at 1500, done at 2300, do one patrol every two hours, and lock the doors when you leave.\n\nI trained the night before for an hour, to get the feel of the place; then reported for my one shift. Things were pretty simple, greet people, make sure no one was stealing anything from the vendors, generally go to wander around and enjoy my day. \n\nThe first problem of the day was a dog that had been left in a truck with no food or water, and the windows were rolled up. Had the manager of the grocery store make a couple announcements on the PA, but no one came to take care of the dog. Ended up calling Animal Control, and after the Officer make some assessments, the owner came out with his shopping complete. I let the Officer handle the rest of the situation, as the owner of the truck/dog seemed very upset that I had involved the Police (this was in the summer, and the outside temp was ~97F, temp scanned in the cab was 118F iirc). Had a couple other minor things that I had to write reports about, but I was stoked to have a calm day.\n\nThen, at 2230, when I was completing my final round for the night, I made the mistake of saying \"Have a good night!\" to a passerby. The man was not pleased by my statement, and he began telling me in great detail just how displeased he was.\n\nThe man was African American, late 30's to early 40's, slim build, about 6' tall, wearing a hoodie and sweats. As I passed and greeted him, he stopped, and said \"I HATE YOU!\" Below is the exchange that he and I had, as best as I can remember it (the IR is sitting in a file in a different state at this point, so I can't look at it):\n\nAngry Man (AM): I HATE YOU SUCURRITEE! I'M DOIN WHAT I NEED! DON'T YOU PUT YOUR EVIL ON ME! YOU'RE THE EVIL ONE SUCURRITEE!\n\nMe: I'm sorry you feel that way sir, I hope you have a better night.\n\nI turn to walk away (stupid, but I felt showing that I was leaving may help the situation), and notice that he's following me\n\nMe: Is there anything I can do to help you sir?\n\nAM: DON'T YOU SIR ME! YOU'RE THE EVIL ONE! FUCKIN SUCURRITEE! I DIDN'T DO NOTHING WRONG! DON'T YOU PUT THAT EVIL ON ME! DON'T YOU DARE! YOU'RE EVIL AND I HATE YOU SUCURRITEE!\n\nAt this point a White Male wearing a black t-shirt and shorts comes up to me, and AM decides to wander farther into the parking lot. The White Male IDs himself as the overnight manager of the grocery store, and says that he'd already chased AM out of his store for \"bothering anything in a skirt.\" I asked Mr. Manager if the Police had been called, and he stated they had not. So I called the local PD, and informed them of my interaction, as well as what Mr. Manager had said, I asked for a squad to respond.\n\nHere's where the unusually large Police Department comes into play. This town has a very large attraction, that a lot of people come to see; therefore, the PD for this suburb is over double what would be needed otherwise. This explains the response I got from calling about a guy who said he hated me.\n \nSix. SIX SQUAD CARS. SIX SQUAD CARS, ONE SUV. SIX SQUAD CARS, ONE SUV, AND A K-9 UNIT. They all arrived within seconds of each other, and the first squad was on scene within 2 minutes of my call. AM hadn't made it 80 yards from where our conversation took place by the time two Officers were talking to him. In 5 minutes, all 8 PD Vehicles and all 15 Officers were busy talking to me, Mr. Manager, and each of the 6 women that wanted to file a complaint about AM. Within 25 minutes, AM had been trespassed from the premises of the strip mall, and the grocery store, and was arrested for sexual assault (since he grabbed the rear ends of two of the women in the store).\n\nThe only PD response that was faster than that night that I've ever dealt with, was at an event in a stadium, and there was a call for an Officer under Duress (guy punched an Officer, myself and the other Officer were struggling with the guy when the call went out). There have been instances (which I'm sure I'll detail here on a later date) where fewer Officers arrived to deal with 70+ people fighting in a street. One of the weirder nights of my career.",

        "text": "The security guard post: http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromsecurity/comments/1xsnnp/finnish_security_guards/\n\nMy background on the Private security:\nA year on the mandatory army service as a Military Police started it all.\n\nAfter the service I was a pumped young man (well I still am) and wanted to learn more about the use of force and security.\nSo I go to the Security guard course, do all the accessory trainings (OC gas [tear gas is not used in Finland anymore as it has some qualities of a nerve agent] expendable baton, vinyl baton [what a waste of time], hand cuffs and the fire arm training]. I get a job from *large security company* soon, and begin to work a mall detective.\n\nSoon after I get a job as a armored car driver. (the security guard -post guy had this wrong, it depends on the company if they let you carry fire arms. Mine did, never had to use it, though, never even thought about drawing it.)\n\nI work this job about a year and a half (now I've been in the industry about 2 years) I am bored to death with being a security guard, as I hasn't had any contact with people for two years while on duty. So I start to consider bouncing and have now been doing it and event security for almost three years now.\n\n**Training**\nThe Finnish government expects every bouncer or event security officer (they are the same thing here, called \"järjestyksenvalvoja\", the best translation is \"order supervisor person\" but we are simply referred as \"security\") to undergo minimum of 32 hours of training. The material that is gone through roughly divides like this:\n13 hours of the basic law information regarding the bouncer\n\n2 hours about the laws of inspecting a person and training the inspection \n\n7 hours training of the use of force (includes vinyl baton and hand cuffs as basic accessories, no professional ever carries a vinyl baton, though, since they provoke people and people might try to grap them.\n\n3 hours of laws about self defense and the rights a bouncer has, but I'll tell about these more later in this text.\n\n2 hours about the confortation of a aggressive person, drugs, alcohol and tobacco, and about the laws regarding them.\n\n2 hours about safety plans, fire safety and emergency situations (a situation that needs more than one police car)\n\nAn hour about the basic instructions for event security\n\n2 hours of first aid\n\nAnd a 2 hour final exam\n\nAfter this you can go to a OC gas course which lets you carry a gas while on duty, if the Police gives you a permit. And there's  another course that is about more use of force and teaches more grappling techniques etc etc\n\nOn 2015 there will be a law change that gives bouncers a right to carry an expendable baton if they take some extra training.\n\n**About the rights and responsibilities**\nOn the field of private security, the bouncers have the most rights and authority. Next to our authority is the police, Defense Forces, Customs and the Coastal Guard of which only a Finnish Defense Force employee can work as a bouncer off duty. Police, Customs and A Finnish Coast Guard -officers may not work as private security. It is because in Finland it is a crime to resist a police officer who is off duty, and if a Police would be on the door of a bar, the customer won't know he's resisting a cop. The customer must know he's resisting a bouncer (which still can get you a good 6 months in prison)\n\nBouncers in Finland may use force in the following situations as written in the law:\nDenying access\nRemoving a person\nWhen detaining a person\nWhen inspecting a detained person\nRemoving an obstacle (some guy protects the target with his body, you may use force on him)\nStop a fleeing target/suspect\nAnd removing a dangerous object or an object\n\nAccessories a bouncer may carry are the following: max 70cm vinyl, wooden or plastic baton, OC gas, hand cuffs and cable ties. Also event security may have a dog with them but it's **very** rare in Finland.\n\nBy law people have to obey the commands given by bouncers. If they don't the bouncer has the right to remove them from the AO.\n\nVenues a \"järjestuksenvalvoja\" may work at are bars, restaurants and hotels, events such as concerts or a hockey match, a camping area and a passenger ship. On passenger ships they may have fire arms and expendable batons etc etc since on the ship the captain gets the final say on everything and after they leave Finland they don't have obey to the Finnish laws anymore but the international sailor laws.\n\n**Salary and the work**\nThe basic salary is about 10-11 euros per hour, but after you've gotten yourself to the industry you might get a 30 hour gig that gets you 1000 euros. The shift might be 8 hours or then again on a music festival it might be 15 hours of work, 5 hours of sleep and back to work. It isn't for people who get tired quickly.\n\nThe best weapon as a bouncer in Finland is your customer service ability. I'd say maybe around 80% of the situations a bouncer has to use force are made by the bouncer himself, especially if the bouncer is a steroid pig and likes brawl and wrestle. But those are the less professional bouncers here. Usually the best kind of bouncers joke around with you and are happy but also firm at the same time.\n\nHere's a picture of a Finnish bouncer (the sign is regulated by law, and usually on a bar door we use a black collar shirt, black army surplus pants and army boots then we have the accessory belt):\nhttp://www.varusteleka.fi/pictures/24429.jpg\n\nAnd here's the basic look of event security (as I said: same job in Finland):\nhttp://www.securitas.com/ImageVaultFiles/id_3688/cf_62/JV_20stadikka_20676x202.JPG\n\nIf you have questions, please ask, I'm happy to talk about the job I love!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Oh, did I mention I was 19? yeah, thanks (company name).\n\nThe building I was working in had an attached parkade. The two hotels next door had a business agreement to use our parkade, and their security staff was allowed to enter the parkade as a result, even though it was on our property. Thank god for this, I actually had some backup on this night.\n\nI respond to a call about a 'suspicious' man in the parkade. two security guards from one hotel, and one from the other also are responding to the same call (we shared a radio frequency). we split up, the two guards from hotel A going down, me and the other going up.\n\nWe spot the guy poking around cars. Clearly he's scoping them out, pulling on door handles, looking for any visible valuables. We get closer. I take point because technically it's my property. I round the car and call out to him\n\n\"This is security, identify your-\"\n\nDude lunges at me, fist coming towards my face. I move to block him, having training in a couple different martial arts. he hits my hand, I feel a blunt pain on my left palm, and then blood rushes down my arm. Motherfucker stabbed me.\n\nI half jump back and am half pushed out of the way by him. Me and guard B back off a bit, and give chase. Making sure to keep our distance from him, but keeping him within our site and close enough so we can jump him if some poor old lady wanders into his path or something. Guard B is yelling all of this on the radio. The other guards are coming up to meet us through a stairwell, not wanting to get directly in his way since he's armed. But they call police. Eventually the 4 of us corral him and force him to run out the main entrance, where the police just happened to be pulling up. We all point and yell. Cop gets out of the car, suspect tries to dodge around the car, gets tazered. we cheer.\n\nGuy got me in the palm of the hand with a really thin blade. A paper scalpel blade. The tip of it went right through my hand, leaving about a 3 quarter inch wound in the palm of my hand, and a little dot  exit wound in the back of my hand. Still got the scar in my palm, though it's shrunk a bit. No real lasting damage. although I do get pains if I hold something in a strong grip with my left hand for a long time.\n\nWent out and got myself some slash resistant gloves after that. Though I dunno how well they would have helped in this specific instance.",

        "text": "I'm not a great story teller but I'll try my best. \n\nThis happened last year, around October. This was my first security site so I was pretty nervous not knowing what was going to happen around here. The site was basically 2 apartment buildings (another guard patrolled that area), 4 levels of under ground parking (top 2 levels we patrol, bottom 2 the other) and then a few stores at ground level. Now we mostly deal with homeless people, and contractors. \n\nDuring my supervisor's shift we got a complaint about someone acting up in the Tim Hortans and had to boot him out. We then placed his car on our watch list in case he returns so we can keep an eye out. \n\nMy shift for that week was a graveyard shift (love graveyard, very quiet at our site). During my regular patrol, I notice he has returned, but this time he is just sitting in his car texting. I note down the time, and continue my patrol. At the end of my patrol I get some free coffee from the Tim Hortans, walking past his car (he hasn't done anything so I just ignored him). \n\nWell he spots me, gets out of his car, and starts screaming at me. Asking me WTF I'm doing, why I'm watching him, etc etc. He is a small guy, 5'8\", maybe less then 150lbs, I'm about 6' and 220lbs but can't really fight (I just grapple people, use my weight to throw them down, and then pin them under it). I tell him we got a complaint awhile ago, and we have to. \n\nHe starts ranting off about how Tim Hortans made a mistake, he has the right to be here, how he lives here (in the incident report from my supervisor, he said his girlfriend lives here). I just tell him thats fine, I'm just here to watch out. He starts cussing at me, and walks up to me looking ready to punch me. I instantly drop my coffee and reach for my flashlight ([Nitecore MH2C 800 lumens](http://image.dhgate.com/albu_368868874_00/1.0x0.jpg)), turning it on to full brightness. He stops dead in his tracks, and shields his face with his hands. \n\nHe asks me to turn off my flashlight, this time MUCH MORE calm and steady, I switch it to strobe mode and turn it off. He then explains himself again, very calmly, how he lives here and is just hanging out not doing anything. I again tell him, that's fine, but we got a complaint about you, so we have to watch out, if we get no more complaints, we will stop watching out. He says alright, and walks back to his car. I got back to my office, looking over my shoulder, to make sure he doesn't change his mind, and then file my incident report. Few minutes later he ends up leaving. \n\n\n**TL;DR Angry short guys wants to hit me. Shone my flashlight in his face, and he instantly calmed down.** ",

        "text": "\nI've had to deal with my fair share of unruly, rude and disgusting people. Thats the whole point of our jobs but theres those people who take being a complete and utter jackass to the next level. \n\nEnter the asshole brigade, Known here as BigA and Lil'A\n\nThey came in uneventfully just seemed like another pair of guys out to have fun, then they found out we had a BYOB club. We implemented the BYOB club after the state smoking bans started taking hits on our patrons.\n\n The club was by contract and private so it circumvented the laws at the time we made it 21 and up smoking and BYOB but because of the alcohol it was only topless but you could leave your bottle in a secure room and come around front for the full show.\n\nUnfortunately it changed the dynamic of the club in security means, because the law stated there must be a solid wall dividing the two areas it made it necessary to have two separate teams of bouncers. Not a huge problem but important to this story, as the night wore on the two attitudes started to change.\n\nLil'A was a happy drunk but that annoying kind of drunk like a 12 year old on a sugar high so the ladies wanted nothing to do with him, besides he was broke as hell. Not a good thing in a stripclub. His buddy was a diffrent story, he started to get mean and surly especially to the girls.\n\nAround midnight BigA heads to the back and 3 of the girls that were hanging out there came back up front complaining that he was saying awful things to them calling the whores saying they were fat, old and ugly and they didnt deserve to be around him. I go back to see whats going on and my BYOB doorman was already giving him the 3rd degree and escorting him out. I was behind him grabbing his things when I hear a scuffle break out down the hall.\n\nWhen he was being led out a dancer was coming up the hallway and BigA shoved her into the bar causing to get the wind knocked out of her and bruising her ribs, my doorman pounced on this guy and drug him out by his jacket and hucked him into the street. BigA tried to rush back but got a solid kick to the guts knocking him cold, the police picked him up quickly. \n\nWe grabbed his buddy and explained to him the situation but he insisted that he was just an acquaintance he met on a job site and would be cool. The night continued but slowed alot, I was working the front desk wben Lil'A comes around and tries to strike up a conversation with me. I want nothing to do with him so I tell him to either enjoy the ladies or call it a night.\n\nHe starts off on this tirade of how his friend wasn't in the wrong and all these bitcbes deserve worse ect. My DJ overhears him as I get up to kick him out and follows me as I get this fool outside. He starts pacing in front of the club threatening to break out windows ect. My DJ called the cops again but this guy starts whipping rocks at cars on the freeway I cant have some idiot causing a crash so I run up to subdue him. \n\nHe does his worst impersonation of Jet Li as he tells me hes going to \"King Fu\" my ass, he throws the laziest kick ever, i just lift the leg he swung a bit higher than he intended and he falls flat on his face. I pinned his arms behind him and waited for the cops, my DJ just laughed in this idiots face.",

        "text": "I took a bit of a hiatus due to work but here are some more tales from my past as a bouncer.\n\n If you work security long enough you end up getting into at least some altercations,  some jobs more than others. Weapons coming into play we all know is just part of the hazards we face, but the weirder ones make for some interesting stories.\n\nThis happened before I could even clock in for the day. It was another summer afternoon in mid July,  summers are hit or miss when it comes to business some days its packed others... meh. Our club normally opened at 2pm so we would normally show up a bit early to clean and setup for the day and we sometimes would have eager guys waiting for us to open up.\n\nWell as a coworker and myself pulled up to the back we see a work truck parked in the lot and a guy standing next to it alone. Already this guy pissed me off because he was nonchalantly pissing in the lot. We had a golden rule (no pun intended) if you piss in the lot, you dont get in. \n\nThe reason was, if they had the capacity to be disrespectful outside then they have the capacity to be worse inside. And usually the beers they were probably pounding before hand are racing through em'. It was an effective rule but my enforcement of it this time had unexpected results. \n\nAs we pulled in to park I grabbed my gear and some items that I brought on slower days to pass the time on breaks and when the club was empty, a set of Rattan Escrima sticks. \n\nI could tell this guy had been slamming Budwiser all day not only from the copious amounts of piss he was haphazardly spraing but the bottles on the ground by his truck. I figured a bit of resistance at the least from this guy so I held both sticks underhand with my left and approached him at an angle to mask them from his LOS.\n\n\"Hey, clean this up and move on you look like you've had too much fun already buddy.\"  I told him\n\"Fuck you! I've b3en waiting all day to see some tits!\" He replied (lovely gentlemen)\n\nI told my other doorman who just pulled up to call the cops as I told this guy to move on again. His back was to me the whole time but I could tell he was fiddling around with something, he had long been done pissing and I was leery he would pull a knife or weapon of some kind.\n\nHe began to sidestep to his truck with a snide \"im fuckin' goin' \" but he instead reaches into his truck bed and I hear a *WOOOSH* he grabbed a 6' gravel shovel and swung it at me. I barely had time to close in to keep from being totaled and soften the hit. He was off balance after the big swing so I shoved him back, as he tried to regain his balance to attempt a second swing I smacked him across the face with one of the sticks and he dropped the shovel. \n\nHe was bleeding pretty good from his mouth and was \"sobered\" by the hit, he tossed the tool back in his truck and sped off. The doorman I had call the cops was sitting on the hood of his car laughing with my boss who arrived during the altercation. \n\n\"Nice hit... next time at least knock out some teeth there Bruce Leroy\" ",

        "text": "Hello all!\n\nI saw a post in /r/videos of a [Security Officer being a complete jackass to some skateboarders,](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/23lqak/security_guard_tries_to_drive_away_with_skaters/) and it reminded me of an incident I had back when I was a patrol officer:\n\nIt was a Friday evening downtown, and the building I was working in had an open ground floor area that acted as the entrance to the parking ramp, as well as a drive through banking area for a bank branch that was in the building. We would get a lot of skaters and bikers through during the warmer months, and usually all we needed to do was go let them know it was private property, and they would be on their way somewhere else.\n\nThis particular night, I saw some teens skating around, moving cones and some other items that were in the area to use as obstacles, so I approached them and the following exchange happened:\n\nMe: Hey guys, just letting you know, this is private property, and you can't skate here.\n\nSkater Kid (SK): Fuck you man! I can do what I want! (continues to skate around)\n\nMe: Well, you can keep skating, and I'll get the Police to come, and you can get cited for trespassing; or you can go find somewhere else to skate.\n\nI should note here, that of the 3 teens skating around, only one was giving me lip, and none of them looked older than 15\n\nSK: Man, fuck you and your wannabe cop ass! I bet if I told you to, you'd come suck my dick you faggot! Yeah! Suck my dick you faggot!\n\nMe: Wait, you want me, a grown man, to suck your dick, but you're calling me a faggot?\n\nSK: Shut up and suck my dick you pansy faggot!\n\nAt this point, SK's friends start laughing at him, and say: \"Man, if you want your dick sucked by a dude so bad, I can just call my brother!\"\n\nThey skated away, and SK was yelling about how getting his Dick sucked by a dude wasn't gay.",

        "text": "After my province implemented stricter licensing and training criteria for new guards, the companies here faced a bit of a problem. They couldn't hire any idiot who passed the background check and then just fire him when he fucks up. They actually had to get and retain good guards. This is good for us because it means higher wages.\n\nTheres a flipside. To prevent this from becoming a guard shortage crisis, the government \"grandfathered\" anyone licensed before the new legislation came into effect. They got new licenses automatically without new training.\n\nSo my company took all the known 'problem' guards who got lucky enough to be grandfathered, and stopped firing them. Instead, they were downgraded to temp, and rotated constantly between sites. Never staying for more than a day or three.\n\nWhy? Because they don't stay put long enough to fuck up visibly, and if they do fuck up, no one knows who they are because they are moved to another site right away. This is how our companies alleviated the guard shortage, by giving us a rotating carousel of dumb temp guards. Of course, some sites we didn't have enough good guards to fill up all the time slots, so we'd get a new dumb temp every week. Have to retrain him, and then he'd be gone. Hooray.\n\nI trained Brett twice. I have actually requested Brett not be allowed on my site due to his psychotic tendencies. My friends at his previous site referred to him as \"fucko the clown\"\n\nHe first got moved to my site after rumour has it he was masturbating in a visible area of the security office at one site. There's no proof of this, but apparently a janitor walked in on him. Time to move him before anyone can do anything. SO I got him. I wasn't aware of his status of \"fucko the clown\" yet until I talked to my guard friends about this. This was the first night I met him.\n\nAs I'm showing him around the building, I'm pointing out the points of entry most vulnerable where vagrants like to sneak in, explain that at 0200 when the clubs let out, he will be dealing with a lot of drunks coming through, and explain our procedures for handling domestic incidents (this was an apartment building with some retail space) \n\nHe's clearly not listening to any of this. and so I repeat the domestic disturbance stuff as it's pretty damn important in this particular building. He looks me in the eye, and says \"boy, I been dealing with shitscum for ten years now\" he taps his 3 cell mag-lite \"if anyone gives me lip, i'll just give them a rap on the noggin\"\n\nI go woah dude, you can't do that. There are very specific use of force criteria and we are NOT authorized to use batons here. Grappling only if force is absolutely necessary, and it's very rarely necessary here. Jumping straight to hitting someone is clearly assault.\n\nHe goes \"Nope. I talked to one of the cops about it. He says as long as the light is on it doesn't count as a weapon.\"\n\nIt... doesn't work like that. That is way outside use of force guidelines, anything used as a weapon is legally classed as a weapon, and last but not least, the legislation governing our licenses actually specifically prohibits using a flashlight as a baton due to the fact that baton training is a separate certification. (companies were issuing mag lites to get around baton certs until the new legislation came into effect)\n\nNope, he's not hearing it. He's been doing security so long blah blah blah yadda yadda. He was hellbent that if someone \"gives me lip\" (yes, the actual words he used) that he was gonna crack them atop the head with his maglite. He was GIDDY about it. He loved the idea of potentially killing a vagrant with a blow to the head.\n\nCouple years later, I'm training a batch of temps for a new site we just acquired. I was the senior guard on site that day, but he talked down to me and everyone training with him as if he was some sort of old captain or something. Advising everyone to get lights like him and be ready to bash all these vagrants upside the head. I reminded him and the group several times that at no time is it legal to use a flashlight as a weapon, and no one in this particular group was authorized to use force anyway. Still, he persisted until I sent him home.\n\nIm sure he never actually hit anyone. The dude was fat and old, and walked by waddling. He probably couldn't move fast enough to hit someone who'd give him trouble. I really hope it was all talk, ",

As idiotic as that is, he also had his toddler with him in a cart and only my supervisors quick reflexes saved the kid from having a face full of melting plastic. The dad was still stubborn, trying to get closer and only left because my supervisor got pissed at him and sprayed him with the extinguisher she had grabbed previously. \n\nLuckily there was no actual fire and the melty light got taken care of quickly, but I still do not understand people who see WARNING DANGER signs and decide to go investigate.

The shopping center is owned by the city so they say if the homeless are awake and not doing anything wrong then they can stay (we get creative to find reasons to get rid of them. But most give us a reason long before though). \n\nSo I'm patrolling one day and I get a call from a vendor in our second building. \"Security, Captain hobomassacre speaking\"\n\nVendor- hi, there's this homeless guy walking around *name of store* and he smells.

Well we'll be right over.\n\nSo I call my coworker and we find the guy. Probably in his 60s and high out of his mind. We dispensed with all niceness and professionalism to get him out. The worst part is that it's become a weekly thing. Some of these people are beyond both help and comprehension ",
