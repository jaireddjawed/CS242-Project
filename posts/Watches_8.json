I still want my watch to be high quality and to be able to be worn daily for as long as I live. I do love the C63 36mm, at least how it looks. However with only a 38 hr power reserve, having the date wheel may be annoying now and then. I wanted to know how it keeps time as I have heard very mixed reviews about the CWs and gaining/losing time. If I’m spending over $1K on a watch, I feel like I can’t compromise on time-keeping ability. Would welcome any pics too!",

My Google-fu is not working out well on this and Movement only has a limited amount of photos on the entire product page.",
