        "text": "**SOLVED**: ANDY BUCKRAM'S TIN MEN, BY CAROL RYRIE BRINK\n\nI really hope this isn't against the sub's rules, but I could really use help identifying the name of a book about robots that I read as a child. I don't recall the details, but the story (possibly stories) involved a boy who may have been an orphan who survived with the help of his robot companions. I remember the robots were described as being made out of scrap, and they varied in size, but were hollow-chested and awkward and very susceptible to water. They did, however, help protect the boy and he kept them functional. I remember a part about how they accessed, via boat, an island on a river and were compromised along the way. I think the story discussed the three laws of robotics.\n\nAs a child in the 80s I felt like it was a really old story (maybe a series of short stories?), but I don't know when they were written. I've been searching for this for years but I don't remember enough about it to find it again.\n\nEdit: Added the rough time I would have read this. Would've been the late 80s, but I believe the books were written a long time prior to that. They were probably set around the turn of the 20th century or a decade or two after that.",

        "text": "I feel like I've come across two definitions of \"climax\" as it pertains to narratives. One definition is: the point of highest tension or suspense in the narrative's plot. Another is: the turning point in a narrative's plot - the point at which the path to the resolution begins.\n\nTo me, these seem like these would often make for two distinct moments in the narrative. So, wouldn't many narratives have two climaxes?\n\nHow do you go about finding the climax of a narrative? Take, for example, the following narrative.\n\n*A man sees a beast drag his dead son's corpse into a bewitched, evil forest. (The beast has killed the boy.) As a result, the man vows to kill the beast to avenge his son.\n\n*The state forbids the man from going into the forest to hunt the beast.\n\n*An angel appears to the man permitting him to stalk and kill the beast. The angel tells the man he has found the beast once he has spotted a fire atop a hill.\n\n*The man takes a long journey through the forest and becomes exhausted.\n\n*An enchanted tree guards the man while he sleeps and rejuvenates.\n\n*When the man wakes up, he sees a fire on top of a hill (and thus has found the beast).\n\n*He goes to the top of the hill and kills the beast.\n\n*As he leaves, he lights the evil forest on fire (so as to kill it).\n\nIn this narrative, what would the climax be? \n\nThe protagonist's main goal is avenge his son by killing the beast. So, correct me if I'm wrong, I think the conflict of the narrative is that first the man has to make it through the evil forest to find the beast. Or is the main goal of the protagonist simply to avenge is son - thus the conflict would simply be that he has to kill the beast?\n\nAs for the climax of the story: I feel like the turning point would be when he wakes up from his slumber and sees the fire on top of the hill. It's at that point that the narrative goes from (i) looking for the beast to (ii) having found the beast and now going to kill him. Viewed this way, the point at which the man kills the beast would be a resolution of sorts. However, if you define climax as the moment of greatest suspense, then wouldn't the climax occur right before he kills the beast, i.e., as the man is approaching the beast from behind. If defined this way though, what would the resolution be? The resolution is supposed to be the result of the climax, no? It seems like the resolution of the story would be the man's fleeing through the forest and lighting it on fire. But that doesn't make sense because the man's approaching the beast from behind (i.e., the climax?) doesn't lead the man to flea from and burn the forest. Rather it is killing the beast that leads to the man's fleeing the forest and lighting it on fire.\n\nI've always struggled with mapping the plots of narratives. Someone please help me.",

Gambrell. 2016, I believe) is a mess of allusions to and manipulations of 19th-century Russian lit. It draws on numerous texts, from Pushkin and Gogol to Chekhov, combining them in a textual storm that is as disorienting as the blizzard lending the text its title. I'm not an avid reader as Chekhov, so to take a shot in the dark I'm looking for some recommendations from readers of Chekhov. Specifically, he wrote several short stories that make use of the blizzard as a central device, but I'm not sure which ones, specifically, they are. The two that come to mind are 1) a post-wagon takes shelter in the home of a village priest, who is convinced that his wife is a witch manipulating the storm to avail herself to potential affairs 2) a doctor and someone else (an investigator, perhaps? it's been a while) travel through a snowstorm to examine a body. Isolated by the blizzard they spend the night in a hut, separated from the body only by a wall. The wall creates a tenuous barrier between life and dead, making it almost a zombie tale in a weird way.\n\nIf these ring a bell with anyone, I'd be grateful for references to specific titles or discussion. Not having a copy of Chekhov's collected stories, I'm having some difficulty coming up with the titles for these stories.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLiteraryStudies/comments/8hxo1p/literature_as_universal_eagleton_and_aristotle/",
        "text": "(I'll be using \"art\", \"literature\", and \"poetry\" pretty interchangeably here, hopefully that won't cause any problems.)\n\nThere is a particular narrative about the history of art and the history of the philosophy art that I've encountered in multiple books and blogs about theory.  The narrative is as follows: the majority of us have a certain view about the nature of art and its place in human life, and we take this view of art to be \"natural\", shared by other societies and historical epochs because of how self-evident it is.  However, what we take to be the natural view of art is actually a very recent historical construction, inherited uncritically by us from the Romantic movement.  The Romantic view of art is as follows: first, art is an autonomous domain.  There are practices called \"making art\" and \"consuming art\" that cannot be reduced to other activities or social practices, nor are they dependent on other practices for their existence.  Art is also elevated in some sense.  It is a calling, not an occupation.  This idea reaches its apex in Nietzsche's \"Schopenhauer as Educator\" where he claims that the end-goal of civilization is the production of \"philosophers, artists, and saints\".  Finally, art is also universal, in that experiencing art brings us into contact with timeless, universally valid truths about Beauty and the human condition.  This account can be more or less mystical depending on who's telling it, but that's the basic outline of what the nature of art is, why we make it, and why we consume it.  The problem with this view, though, is not only that it's false, but also that it's morally pernicious.  This view of art was constructed during the Romantic movement as a response to a) the decline of religion (so that art could replace God as an object of veneration), and b) social unrest as a result of the oppressive nature of capitalist societies.  The idea was that, if the working class could be indoctrinated through literature into liberal humanist values and a sense of shared cultural experience with the upper class, then this would foster social unity and decrease the chance of violent revolution.  Talk of \"beauty\" or of a \"universal human condition\" are just ideological mystifications to try and obfuscate the real political aims.  There is nothing natural about the Romantic view of art, and it would be considered strange, if not downright incomprehensible, by other cultures and historical epochs outside of Western societies from the 19th century to the present day.\n\nThis is the same debunking narrative laid out by Terry Eagleton in his \"Literary Theory: An Introduction (Second Edition)\", specifically in the chapter called \"The Rise of English\".  We can see Eagleton here impugning the autonomy of art:\n\n&gt;The assumption that there was an unchanging object known as \"art\", or an isolatable experience called \"beauty\" or the \"aesthetic\", was largely a product of the very alienation of art from social life which we have already touched on.  If literature had ceased to have any obvious function - if the writer was no longer a traditional figure in the pay of the court, the church, or an aristocratic patron - then it was possible to turn this fact to literature's advantage.  The whole point of \"creative\" writing was that it was gloriously useless, an \"end in itself\" loftily removed from any sordrid social purpose.  Having lost his patron, the writer discovered a substitute in the poetic.  It is, in fact, somewhat improbable that the Iliad was art to the ancient Greeks in the same sense that a cathedral was an artefact for the Middle Ages or Andy Warhol's work is art for us; but the effect of aesthetics was to suppress these historical differences. (p. 18-19)\n\n(By \"impugning the autonomy of art\", I don't mean to imply that he's making any normative claims about whether or not art should be autonomous, or any empirical claims about whether or not art actually is autonomous today, only that he's claiming that the notion of \"the autonomy of art\" is a concept that arose under specific historical and social conditions in 19th century Europe and the concept is not natural, perhaps not even conceivable, outside of those conditions.)\n\nHere he criticizes the elevated status of art:\n\n&gt;Since we ourselves are post-Romantics, in the sense of being products of that epoch rather than confidently posterior to it, it is hard for us to grasp just what a curious historically particular ideas this is.  It would certainly have seemed so to most of the English writers whose \"imaginative vision\" we now reverently elevate about the merely \"prosaic\" discourse of those who can find nothing more dramatic to write about than the Black Death or the Warsaw ghetto. (p. 16)\n\nThe sarcasm here is obvious.  Eagleton doesn't see why literature should hold an elevated position above factual accounts of the historical events he mentions; in fact, he thinks this view of art actively obstructs the kind of rational, critical thinking about reality that is necessary for positive social change.\n\nFinally, here we have Eagleton on the universality of art:\n\n&gt;Literature was in several ways a suitable candidate for this ideological enterprise.  As a liberal, \"humanizing\" pursuit, it could provide a potent antidote to political bigotry and ideological extremism.  Since literature, as we know, deals in universal human values rather than in such historical trivia as civil wars, the oppression of women or the dispossession of the English peasantry, it could serve to place in cosmic perspective the petty demands of working people for decent living conditions or greater control over their own lives, and might even with luck come to render them oblivious of such issues in their high-minded contemplation of eternal truths and beauties. (p. 22)\n\nAgain, behind the obvious layer of sarcasm, Eagleton's view is clear: the idea of universal truth or beauty in art is an ideological fiction designed to distract people from the problems facing them in concrete reality.  Even in happier political times, when people would have more time for leisure and contemplation, Eagleton does not seem to think there is anything universal in literature waiting to be contemplated: he claims in the Conclusion that\n\n&gt;Shakespeare was not great literature lying conveniently to hand, which the literary institution then happily discovered: he is great literature because the institution constitutes him as such.  This does not mean that he is not \"really\" great literature - that is just a matter of people's opinions about him - because there is no such thing as literature which is \"really\" great, or \"really\" anything, independently of the ways in which that writing is treated within specific forms of social and institutional life. (p. 176)\n\nCertainly, it is hard to see how someone who believes that no work of literature is \"really anything\" could also believe that literature has anything valuable to teach us about beauty or humanity (independently of how it is constituted by institutional practices, of course).\n\nIt is certainly not my intention to refute Eagleton's narrative wholesale.  I am in agreement with large parts of it.  The level of spiritual importance placed by the Romantic movement on art, and their relation of art with what is essentially the salvation of humanity, is indeed historically unique.  Eagleton's account of literature as a mechanism of social control seems quite plausible.  I also agree, to a certain degree, with his aesthetic anti-realism.  If someone finds nothing of value in reading Shakespeare, then there is no rational argument that could compel him to find something of value in Shakespeare.  Whatever we personally get out of reading Shakespeare is due to quirks of our individual psychology and the social practices we were raised in. (However, quirks of individual psychology should not at all be devalued, as I'll return to at the very end of this post.)\n\nMy main contention is that the Romantic view of art is not quite as unnatural or historically unique as Eagleton makes it out to be.  As evidence, I'll be turning to Aristotle's Poetics.  I believe that in this text, we can already see traces of the key Romantic notions of the autonomy, elevatedness, and universality of art.\n\nFirst, we have to ask, what are the conceptual implications of the fact that the Poetics exists at all?  The text is about art and nothing but art.  Doesn't this imply that Aristotle already had some conception of the autonomy of art?  It's right there in the first sentence: \"I propose to treat of Poetry *in itself* and of its various kinds, noting the essential quality of each...\" (italics mine).  Certainly I don't mean to imply that we find in Poetics the kind of highly refined *l'art pour l'art* conception of the autonomy of art that the modernists held.  But nor do we find evidence that art was so tightly bound with the social and religious practices of ancient Greece that it was impossible to conceive of art as an object of appreciation and study in its own right.\n\nAs for the elevatedness and universality of art, the key passage is here, in Part IX of Section I:\n\n&gt;It is, moreover, evident from what has been said, that it is not the function of the poet to relate what has happened, but what may happen- what is possible according to the law of probability or necessity. The poet and the historian differ not by writing in verse or in prose. The work of Herodotus might be put into verse, and it would still be a species of history, with meter no less than without it. The true difference is that one relates what has happened, the other what may happen. Poetry, therefore, is a more philosophical and a higher thing than history: for poetry tends to express the universal, history the particular. By the universal I mean how a person of a certain type on occasion speak or act, according to the law of probability or necessity; and it is this universality at which poetry aims in the names she attaches to the personages.\n\nIronically, Aristotle endorses the exact view of the supremacy of poetry over history that Eagleton attacks as a recent historical invention!  I don't think there's much more to say on this point: Aristotle's meaning is quite clear, and this historical data point is a problem for Eagleton's account of the historical development of the elevated status of poetry.  I don't want to argue whether this view is true or not, I only want to point out that any conception of the elevated status of art is not necessarily due to the ideological machinations of industrial capitalism.\n\nAs for Aristotle's comment that \"poetry aims at the universal\", it is perhaps more open to ambiguity.  It does not appear to be the full-blooded conception of universality that we find in Romanticism, the idea that poetry puts us in communion with Universal Truth and Beauty.  Aristotle's conception of the universal is perhaps more down to earth, being merely \"how a person of a certain type may speak or act\".  I think, however, this notion is a clear forerunner to the Romantic idea of art teaching us about the universal aspects of the human condition, albeit in a less developed and less spiritualized form.  Aristotle also notes the \"universal pleasure felt in things imitated\" in Part IV of Section I, indicating that he saw the production and enjoyment of art as something natural, rather than something that had to be created by institutions.\n\nI am certainly not arguing that Aristotle's conception of art is identical to the Romantic conception.  I'm only saying that there is a clear continuity (in the West) between the earliest attempts to theorize art and the way we think about art today.  Eagleton, at the very least, downplays this continuity, and runs the risk of denying it altogether.  It's hard to imagine that Eagleton could have been unfamiliar with the Poetics, so it's hard to see how he could have been unfamiliar with these objections to his account (Aristotle's claim about the relative value of poetry and history in particular is very striking).  So if I've grossly misinterpreted either Aristotle or Eagleton, please let me know.\n\nWhile I'm here, I'd like to bring up for discussion two other aspects of Eagleton's account that I find puzzling.  Returning to the passage I quoted on page 22, Eagleton claims that contemplation of literature and philosophy can distract working-class people from the dire nature of their situation and the need for social change.  This is *prima facie* plausible.  But let's follow the argument all the way through: if intellectual comforts can act as an insidious anesthetic, can't material comforts do the same thing?  If the working poor have access to things like air conditioners and refrigerators, won't the added material comfort make them less likely to rebel?  Taken to its logical conclusion, Eagleton's line of thinking seems to lead us to a sort of manic accelerationism:  the conditions of the working class should be made as bad as possible in order to encourage them to resolve the social antagonisms sooner.  It is not unprecedented for Marxists to endorse conclusions of this nature; I just want the implications to be clear here.\n\nFinally, although I haven't read the entire book yet, I can't help but get the impression that throughout the work, Eagleton takes a hostile tone towards not only recent literary theory, but also towards literature itself.  This is a somewhat strange position for a professor of English to take.  On Eagleton's view, we cannot justify the production and consumption of literature on account of its ability to illuminate the human condition, since he views this as a harmful ideological fiction.  On page 23, he is critical of the view that literature is a way of experiencing new things; if the lives of workers were not so impoverished, he claims, then they would not need to seek experiences in literature, because they would have enough experiences in real life.  So what, exactly, is the point of writing or reading literature at all?  \"To enact political change\", I presume he would have to say.  But this doesn't seem to empirically account for the wealth of reasons why people actually write and read literature.  Is anyone who reads or writes for pleasure merely in the snare of ideology?  This view also has the consequence that, after the socialist revolution, art will become obsolete, since the necessary political changes will have been enacted.  But is it really plausible that such an enduring human practice could come to an end?  Is it desirable?\n\nFor my part, I find Marcuse's \"The Aesthetic Dimension\", also written from a Marxist perspective, to be a more compelling account of how art fits into a materialist world of class struggle.  To summarize his arguments there, Marcuse outlines a vision of art whereby art communicates subjectively-experienced truths about reality that have been suppressed by prevailing discourse.  Far from viewing talk about subjectivity and experience as a humanist distraction, it is rather the subjective experience of suffering, and the experience of empathy for those who suffer, that provides the engine of social change in the first place.  Marcuse is also careful to outline a universalist function for art: since suffering and tragedy are trans-historical, universal aspects of the human condition, and art takes suffering as its object, art can be said to deal with what is universal in humanity; thus there would also be a continued place for art in any hypothetical socialist society.  As Marcuse puts it, \"no society can abolish fate\".",

The introduction to the edition I bought begins by explaining the various poetic forms used in the play: specifically, *romances*, *redondillas*, *quintillas*, *sextillas*, *octavas reales*, and *décimas*. I've been conscientiously marking up each segment of the play according to its poetic form -- this is actually a lot of fun (for me).\n\nAnyway, all was going well until the entrance of don Gonzalo de Ulloa y el Rey don Alonso de Castilla in the middle of Act 1 (this is after Don Juan has washed ashore and is rescued by Tisbea). At that point there is a sequence of maybe two dozen lines, beginning with *¿Cómo os ha sucedido en la embajada?* and ending with *Es Lisboa una otava maravilla*, that don't fit any of the six poetic forms. After that the play lapses into a long *romance*, thank goodness.\n\nIs anyone out there able to propose an analysis of those lines?",

My interests revolve mostly about intercultural identity among Latin American immigrants to the U.S., and elsewhere.

I've mostly been looking for universities with a sizable amount of Latinx/Chicanx focused professors, which has put NYU, UCLA, and Northwestern at the top of my list. However, since I would also like to incorporate literature from the originating countries (i.e. literature in Spanish), I was wondering whether I would benefit from also looking into comparative literature programs. My university doesn't have a comp lit undergrad or even a Spanish literature program, so I haven't been able to get a very good feel for what departments of that type are like. If anyone has suggestions, I'd really appreciate it! \n\nAlso, I'd like to add that I already speak/read/write Spanish fluently.

Which sounds insane to me, who hear it as a stressed unstressed unstressed pattern, ie a dactyl. \n\nSo basically I was hoping someone could help me make sense of this. Or perhaps I answered my own question – secondary stresses are stresses all the same. \n\nIf that were the case, I would like to improve my 'metrical ear'. Any tips for how to do that? I've read some poetry, and I frequently try to count the stresses, but it seems this is to no avail if I'm not aware of the times I get it wrong. \n\nThanks a bunch! ",

Listing out all the titles for each publication feels silly. Also, Russian poetry mags typically have a title for the whole 10-poem selection, but if I use that title it looks like it's one poem instead of 10.\n\nWhat are the actual standards when it comes to this? Should I really list all poem titles? Should I just indicate how many poems there are for each publication and skip the publication title? Or just use the name of the magazine only, and leave the rest out of it completely? Please, advise.\n\nThanks!",

Lately I've been thinking about one of his pieces, [in which a man who cursed death in his youth comes to covet it in his old age, when he finds himself unable to die](http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/dun/gope/gope24.htm). \n\nThis most superficially seems to be a callback to the Greek myth of [Tithonus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tithonus), who was gifted immortality because a goddess loved him, but only shriveled and shriveled with the years, until he became a cricket. But Dunsany seems to introduce a unique element, related to themes of agency, regret, and humanity's preoccupation. Where Tithonus has no personality, and is just another victim of an ever-capricious godhood, Dunsany's prophet not only actively spurns the natural order, but accomplishes his goal. \n\nHis punishment isn't an active punishment at all, rather the attainment of a victory. It paints the picture of humanity living in a fragile bubble, that if we ever took stock of the inevitabilities in life, we would see how graciously everything fits together.  \n\nWas this concept as innovative as I seem to think? it seems Poe-esque but I don't think I recognize it in any of his writing.

My very first sentence is \"In Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart (year), [...]\", and I am unsure whether I should write the publication year of the edition I am using (2001), or write the year in which it was first published (1958).\n\nFor all other intents and purposes I am using my Penguin edition as the reference, but I'm thinking it may be interpreted as if the book was published for the very first time in 2001 if I present it as such in the first sentence.\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated.",

We decided this would be a beautifully poetic and apt title for our project, so we adopted it.\n\nThen, I went to write a quick post-script about the source of the title in which I provide a full quote from the novel that includes the title, and here lies the twist - the quote is not in the novel! I searched for the phrase and it does not show up anywhere, and none of the online sources that make this claim give the full quote or give any specific citation.\n\nMy theory is that it exists in some film or stage adaptation, and then was later attributed to the novel, but with so many different adaptations I have no idea where to start. I thought I would reach out to you wise folks to see if anyone has chased down this reference and knows where it actually originates. I posted this on r/literature and despite several upvotes and a great discussion in which multiple users were tracing deeper and deeper origins of the original Wikipedia edit, the moderators banned me and have refused to give me any reason why.  Hopefully this subreddit is a little more friendly!\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated :)\n",

When I filled out forms and registered, I wrote down \"thesis program\" instead of the comprehensive exam program. I think I have this myopic idea of the thesis program as a better one for those who'd like to teach college-level literature and academic writing, as well as those who'd like to do research in their respective fields.\n\nTwo nights ago after class, our classmates and I brought up some concerns about the program (the three of us are in our first term, while one is about to write her thesis). Our professor (who happens to be one of the graduate-level advisers in our department) actually explained that the comprehensive exam and the thesis programs involve the same academic rigor; the exam program differs in the number of units required. She did say, additionally, that the exam program is more efficient and is perfect for working professionals (like myself).\n\nAny thoughts on the pros and cons of the thesis program versus the comprehensive exam program?\n\nI thought that I've already made up my mind about some thesis topics, but I'm beginning to question my initial decision.\n\nThank you, by the way. Just to provide a bit of context, I study at a Philippine university. My professor studied overseas for her postgrad (and took the comprehensive exam for her first Master's degree).\n\nHave a great weekend!",
