Anyway, I see this girl trying on lipsticks that were sealed and obviously not marked \"tester\". This makes me so mad. Do they know how nasty that is? How much product gets wasted because they put their nasty lips on it? \nThis lady is taking plastic seals off of lipsticks to test them out! So I go up to her and tell her she can't do that and she is destroying product and could make people sick. I point out to her that there are testers right there, but she doesn't want to use them because she doesn't want to get sick!\nWell people like you are why testers don't work! Because people put them right on their lips instead of using a q-tip, then people don't want to use the same one so they taint others. ",

        "text": "When I was 16, and still on good terms with my father, while he wasn’t home I would drive my sister and myself over to his house to pick up his dog to play with her while he was gone. This particular day we went over, as usually, got the dog, and headed out. We were going to go to the dog park, but on the way I remembered I needed to stop for some paint or another, a run into the store run out and we would be on our way to the park.\n\n\nThe temp if I do remember was about 70~ ish with a slight breeze, so being 16 I left the windows cracked in the car and me and my sister headed inside of big name craft store in America.\n\n\nDidn’t think much of it, because windows were cracked (enough to stick her face out of) and I knew exactly where in the store the paint was, and it wasn’t busy so I head in.\n\n\nI am in line for check out, which was 5 minutes later and on the over head I get a page that says ‘license plate xxx come to the counter’ to which I did. As I approach I was greeted by a SCREAMING employee. \n\n\n“What the HELL are you thinking?? You are leaving your poor dog in the car like that?? I hope you know the police are called and are on their way, we called them as an emergency”\n\n\nI looked at here and didn’t say anything, so I began to leave.\n\n\n“your dog is in distress, how DARE YOU, you inhumane B****” she screamed as I walked out.\n\n\nWhen I got outside, there was another old woman standing by my car.\n\n\n“There you are! Is this your car?? I was about to break the F***ing window, you are disgusting leaving your dog in the car like that”\n\n\nI opened the door, and the inside was still cool from the ac. Dog was fine, her fur was still cool. And the woman goes ...\n\n\n“you better not leave, the police are almost here and we have your license plate number!!”\n\n\nSo cue to the police and they arrive. Young looking dude, looked annoyed af. He told me the dangers of leaving the dog in the car and not to do it again. \n\n\nAngry worked exits the store at this point, with the bottle of **diet coke** in her hand. \n\n\n“here!” she screaming and pours the diet coke in a cup. She forced it under the dog’s nose and of course the dog began to drink it.\n\n\n“how dare you child” she said again with a glair as she walked away. She then turned around a final times and goes \"I hope you get arrested, you deserve it!\" The lady that was already by my car was in our car watching us at this point. After the police guy left, I left as well.\n\n\nGuys, yes its wrong to leave your dog in the car, I get that. I was 16, I wasn’t thinking of being ‘inhumane’, I love all dogs. I just didn’t understand the dangers of it. The fact that the worker in the store called me inhumane always stuck with me all these years later. \n",

        "text": "I once had a piece of software that required a password to open a file. Every few years I would update to the newest version. One year, a small change occurred in the software that drove me nuts. In all previous versions, when I started the program a window would pop up asking for my password. I typed it in and pressed ENTER and I was then able to use the program. But in this newest version, there was a slight difference: instead of simply typing my password, I had to CLICK the cursor on the pop up window to make it the active window, *then* I was able to enter my password. This drove me bonkers. Such a little detail some developer had clearly overlooked. I want my newer software to be more user friendly, not less!\n\nWell, each time I bought a new version of said software, I was entitled to one 30-minute tech support call for free within 12 months. In the first two weeks, I used my 30-minutes of support on, you guessed it, how to get the software to make the password pop up window to be active by default. It drove the call center person nuts and I could hear them thinking, \"are you seriously using your one free support call that we normally charge $79 for to complain about a minor inconvenience such as this?\" The call ended without resolution and I had wasted my support call. Yep, that was me, not one of my proud moments.\n\nWhat I should have done is called their product feedback line and shared my concerns there.\n\nEDIT: Well, I just realized that they fixed it at some point. I don't know what version they fixed it at, but it now places the cursor in the password box once again. Perhaps my complaints did not go unnoticed.",

        "text": "I'll make this one quick, it's not a huge deal but it's just something that got to me personally. For reference, I am twentysomething and I have some anxiety that makes me really nervous in a lot of social situations. \n\nA few days ago I bought a video game from [game retailer]. (Kingdom Hearts 2.5 for those wondering.) I was happy with the game but about three hours in it suddenly crashed and I lost some save data. Okay, I figured it was a fluke and kept playing, being sure to save more frequently. But it happened a total of four times over the course of a day and when I took the disc out to look at it, I noticed there was some weird warping. The disc was damaged. I was distressed, but eventually decided to bite the bullet and return it. \n\nIt sounds pathetic but I rehearsed my \"I need to return this\" speech on my way to the store. I hate inconveniencing anyone, and having worked in retail for four years in the past I'm always very cautious of being a good customer. I checked their policy on the receipt to make sure that it would be okay for me to exchange it. I was well within their exchange limits. Still I was pretty nervous. \n\nI arrive at the store and there's someone at the register, making a purchase, and only one employee working, so I hang around in line and browse the random merchandise they have near the register as I wait. It takes a while, the customer ahead of me is asking lots of questions, but I don't really mind when they just want to make sure they're getting what they want. \n\nIt takes about ten minutes for them to check out and once they do, I move up to take their place. \"Hi there,\" I say to the cashier who didn't say a word to me in greeting, staring at me blankly. Already I feel a little nervous but I take the game out of the bag, along with my receipt, and set them on the counter. \"I bought this a couple of days ago, and it's been freezing and crashing on me. I took a look and it seems like the disc is damaged. Could I swap it for another one?\" \n\nHe just kind of stares at me for a moment--still not saying a word, mind you--and then picks up my receipt to look it over.\n\n\"Are you sure it's the disc?\" he asks me in a monotone. I nod, and he looks up at me with this weird, kind of smug look. \"It sounds more like a problem with your console.\" \n\n\"Uh, well,\" I stutter. I'm absolutely sure that it's not my console, but I don't have the kind of confidence to tell him so. \"You can check the disc yourself.\" \n\nHe rolls his eyes at me and takes the game case, popping it open and removing the disc. He checks the back and tilts it repeatedly. There's not very good lighting in the store so it takes him a few moments to look it over. Finally, he says in a condescending tone, \"It looks fine to me, but whatever. I guess I can exchange it.\" \n\nSeriously guys, that disc had these weird dotted markings that almost looked like heat damage, in addition to a couple of scratches. It was definitely messed up. Without another word he scans my receipt, scans the game, and swaps the disc. He hands it to me without a word. \n\nMy hand is shaking a little when I take it. It's embarrassing how overly sensitive I am, I know. I muttered my thanks and escaped to my car. \n\nI don't know, it was just upsetting. It's been on my mind all day. But at least my game is running fine now. ",

So there's a power outage and this thing is giving me the blinking yellow light of death. I'm baffled. My idiot brain didn't even think to power drain the system. Anyway, I call up tech support and they're lovely. Full nine yards, everything you could want and I try to return the favor.\n\nWell, I find out that I called on the last day of my warranty. \"Oh lucky me.\" Well, it doesn't matter because they give me the info I need to fix it (hold the power button while its unplugged, ya dingus). \n\n&gt;Do you have time for a quick survey?\n\n\"Well sure I do, Juan, I'd be happy to answer some questions.\" I give this guy flying colors because I've got nowhere to be and hey, maybe he'll get a raise or he's on probation, you never know.\n\nSo that's done and a month later it happens again. I suspect my roommate may have unplugged my computer to plug in his $inferiorgamemachine without shutting my PC down...\n\nSo I call up the ever lovely tech support.\nThey're just as cordial as last time and I explain the issue.  They tell me my warranty is expired (as I'm aware) and that I'll have to be paying a substantial sum to get it fixed. Now, I'm in a tight spot monetarily right now and I ask if there's anything they can do. They apologize and say no when I, in passing, mention Juan and the wonderful service and he gave me and the lady I'm on the phone with now has given me today. I'm about to say have a nice day and she says \"Hold on one moment please.\" I hold on for a moment and she comes back and says.\n\n\"We will allow a one-time exception...fixed...outside of warranty.\" HOLY SMOKES, BATMAN! (too soon?) I'm gonna get this thing fixed for free and the model is getting upgraded. \n\nSo yeah, I'm sending it in (with free shipping) in a few days. So that's all I have to say. Let me leave you with this: Be nice to customer service. They hold your ~~fate~~ wallet in their hands.",

        "text": "So I was at my local branch of a certain discount store to pick up an order I'd made a few days before. As I go to wait in line, I see it's busy and they're using numbers. Above the counter, there's a big sign with in bright red the number of the customer who's next.\n\nWhat I also see is a woman whose face is the spitting image of Missy from Doctor Who. This is not an exaggeration. While her hair and clothing were different, her face and general vibe were an exact match. As such, I'll be calling her Missy from here on out.\n\nOf course, I draw a number and wait my turn. As I'm waiting, the next person comes up. A man with a baby on his arm. As he steps towards the counter, the following exchange happens:\n\n**Missy**:*Excuse me, I'm first.*  \n**Man**:*But my number is up. Look.*  \n**Missy**:*I've been waiting here longer than you! They're helping me first.*  \n**Man**:*What? But I've been waiting for my number.*  \n**Missy**:*How is that my problem? I'm not just going to wait! I've waited long enough! I'll be helped now!*\n\nAt this point, an employee interjected to help the man, while leaving Missy for her coworker. This did diffuse the situation, although I'd have liked to see Missy get turned away. It's a miracle the baby didn't cry, as Missy was getting kind of loud during all of this, all in a tone of voice that suggested she blamed the man for the entire thing.\n\nThis all could have been avoided if she took the hint by looking at the bright red sign, went to the dispenser located right in the middle of the waiting area and thus is impossible to miss, and drew a number from it. Does she think it's for show or something?\n\nAnyway, I thought I'd post it here as a way to vent because customers like that really infuriate me, and I wasn't in a brave enough mood to tell her off for it.\n\n*(I should note that I don't remember the exact exchange, so I approximated the things that were said. I hope I've managed to capture the sense of entitlement.)*",

I found an app called Vysor that allowed controlling my phone from my computer while it's plugged by USB, but that wasn't really doing the deed. So I looked up on the Internet, tried factory resets but it didn't solve anything. \n\nAs I had read the customer service was quite neat and I held a screen replacement voucher (bought 15$ with the phone), I figured I should contact them. First experience was quite good. They suggested I did another factory reset, to which I complied even if I knew it wouldn't solve my issue. Then they sent me the infos needed to send my phone to the workshop in Saint Leonard into repair for a screen replacement.\n\nI sent my phone on the **April 10** and didn't receive any confirmation of its arrival. \n\n*Something to know beforehand is that this company's support thought it would be nice that everytime you send them a mail, they'll reply with automated response, informing you that they \"have received your email and one of them will be reading it and aim to get back to you in the next 24 hours\". Sounds at first like a good idea cause you get a confirmation of reception, but when you end up sending 10 emails like me, it's just outright annoying.*\n\nOn the **April 19**, I sent a first mail, enquiring about whether they had received my phone. The only reply I got was from an employee telling me he would ask for an update and notify me about the status of my request and informing me about the delays of such an operation : 2-3 weeks as of the date upon receipt of the device at their workshop, plus a \"slight added time if spare parts are required\".  \n\nOn **April 27**, being kind of annoyed that I didn't get the promised status update, I reached out again for customer support.  This time I was told again that the employee would ask for an update. Fortunately, this time, I did get my update. Unfortunately the only info I got was that my device was \"awaiting spare parts\".\n\nNow I know that customer service isn't a always simple job, with often many customers pouring their anger on you for things that are completely unrelated to you. Therefore I always try to be as pleasant as can be towards these guys for the harsh job they have. However, in my situation, it had been almost 3 weeks since I sent my phone and I had been initially told that repairs would take 2 to 3 weeks. Learning that spare parts were needed (something that anyone could have possibly guessed right from the start), I figured that it would then take no more than a week or two for my phone to be ready, so I *patiently* let it go.\n\nI decided to try my luck again on **May 4**, asking for another update. Same routine as before: first a mail from the same guy telling me he would ask for an update, then the update. This time, it only said \"Product still awaiting spare parts. No info on delivery date\". Still I did nothing.\n\nTwo and a half weeks later, on **May 22** I reach out again to customer support, assuming some progress, at least slight, must have been made. I quickly get the automated response but not my usual useless \"I'll ask for an update\" response from the employee with the usual 3 hour delay. Instead it's a 3 day delay, so **May 25**, but the answer is the same as always \"I'll ask the workshop for an update. I'll contact you when I have news\".\n\nAs you can figure out from me writing this post, I didn't get any news from the customer service since then. So today, **June 10**, exaclty two months after I sent my phone to support, I decided I had had enough and sent them a bitter email to kindly tell them they were the worst support team I had encountered, that, seeing they were unable to repair my phone, they should consider sending me a new phone instead and that they should at least have the decency to answer to my emails and be the least bit honest with.\n\nNow I realise that my two months of waiting for customer service is highly unlikely to be the longest someone ever waited for something, even simple, to be repaired, but that's not really my point. I want to state it again that I completely understand that repair delays are seldom in the hands of people working in customer support and thus I would never hold them accountable for such a frustrating experience as they already have a harsh job and angry customers to deal with. \nMy problem is the apparent lack of consideration support seems to have for its customers. Starting with the annoying automated response (it should be noted that this automated response is full of grammatical and spelling mistakes), the employee who, when he deems your mail worthy of a response, does it with a weak mastery of your language (I'm not saying he should have mastered french, I had first contacted them in english. Hell, having bought my phone off Amazon from an UK company I didn't even expect to find a customer service workshop in France).\n\nI just wanted to share that with you all and to know if some of you out there have been experiencing the same kind of trouble with cellphone customer support or if I've just drew the short straw. I strongly think that not having any information given is one of the worst and most infuriating thing that can happen during this kind of process",

        "text": "I work at a theatre about 10 meters away from a popular phone repair chain store. It was recently my birthday so I was offered to have my charging port repaired by my family (god bless them). \n\nI went to the store and explained to them what's going on, and they said they'll repair it for $150, what I tend to make in 2-4 days here in the states. My family paid for it thankfully, and they ordered the piece and told me they'd call me in the next 3-4 days when they got it.\n\nAlmost a week passed without a phone call and they finally got ahold of me. I told them I could come in Saturday (let's say tomorrow), sometime between 1 and 3. Thankfully I wasn't in too much of a rush to get it done so i didn't think too much about it. I come in right before I get to work, and they say it'll take about four or five hours. I got impatient, after I even told them what time I was coming, but they couldn't give me an actual appointment since I just specified a range (what I could only assume). I told them instead I want it on Tuesday at 1 PM exactly instead so it'll be done faster. They agreed.\n\nTuesday comes, I drop my phone off after they said it would take about an hour or so didn't think too much of it, went on my break to go pick it up, after which they hand me my phone, and the back panel is cracked entirely. Now I was just flatout annoyed. They said the adhesive on the case was a bit stronger than what they anticipated when they pulled it off and it broke, but they ordered the new piece right away, and told me it'll be about 3 days or so, and for free obviously.\n\nNow I work in movie theatres and I'm certainly one to understand accidents happen all the time. But this situation just continued to snowball on top of previous problems, leading me to drive back and forth to the place, about 20 miles or so, on days when I'm not supposed to work (I work part time, mind you), wasting gas money and time, since my car's MPG runs on a coal furnace for how much gas can get in my area.\n\nI'm leaving to Europe very soon, and there's still no phone call. I decided when I drive to work, I'll go there and ask what the hell has been happening with this, because it needs to get done already. Conveniently, they call me as I'm getting to work, and tell them I'm on my way.\n\nI get there and they tell me the piece was on back order. They knew I had somewhere I needed to be soon. I wanted it to be ready long before then. At least they took my phone and worked on it and in 20 minutes, it was done. After the whole fiasco concludes, I kindly ask if I could get some sort of reimbursement from the original transaction since everything before and after took alot of time and gas money to get to.\n\"We can give you 10% of your next phone repair.\" They said.\n\nI get that anyways because I work in the plaza they're located at.\n\nI ask *again* if I could get that off the original transaction. They said in order to do that they'd need to refund the original transaction with the card (that wasn't mine, it was my family's), email corporate and ask if they could apply a greater value, run the transaction again, collect all the wumpa fruits to restore my health, recalibrate the photon lasers, get all the happy meal toys, yadayadayadayadayada.\n\nAt the end of it, the manager instead offers me 15% instead of 10% off my next repair. Everyone has a smartphone nowadays, everyone knows repairing anything off of your phone with 10% is peanuts. I don't think that necessarily makes me want to come back. I just wanted to lighten the burden on my family for how much they've done.",

        "text": "Several years ago, a coworker and I were sent out of state to Florida for management training at the company's headquarters. After spending all day on the road, we pulled off on the first exit from I-95 in Jacksonville to get gas before heading to our hotel. While my coworker filled up the car, he handed me $10 and asked me to get him a pack of cigarettes from the gas station's convenience store. I head inside, walk up to the girl behind the counter, and ask for a pack of my coworker's preferred brand. She asks to see my ID; just the standard procedure so far. I hand it to her, and she spends about the next 30 seconds or so looking at in complete confusion. She holds it up to the light, as if looking for a watermark, then we have this exchange:\n\n\n**Cashier:** \"I don't know what this is. What is this?\"\n\n**Me:** \"It's my driver's license.\"\n\n**Cashier:** \"No. I know what a driver's license looks like. I see them a hundred times a day. This is fake.\"\n\n**Me:** \"That's impossible. I got that straight from the DMV. Why do you think it's fake?\"\n\n**Cashier:** \"It's supposed to green at the top, and this is purple.\"\n\n**Me:** \"That's because it's a Virginia driver's license.\"\n\nShe looks mystified, and looks back at my DL intently...\n\n**Cashier:** \"Where does it say that?\"\n\nI lean over the counter and point...\n\n**Me:** \"Right here in the corner where is says 'Virginia' in big italic letters, at the top where is says 'VA, USA', and it lists my Virginia address.\"\n\n**Cashier:** \"Where is that? That doesn't sound real.\"\n\n**Me:** \"You've never heard of Virginia? You're right off I-95, haven't you ever carded anyone from other states?\"\n\nShe remains silent, and just looks at me skeptically, as though I'm attempting to somehow scam or cheat her.\n\n**Me:** \"I'm not giving you a geography lesson. Are you going to sell me cigarettes or not?\"\n\nShe handed back my DL without saying a word. Stunned at how ridiculous this is, I turned and walked out the store. As I was getting back in the car, I saw her watching us leave from the front doors, with a self-satisfied smirk on her face, as if she had just defeated me in an intense battle of the wits. \n\nThat was my first ever interaction with a Floridian, and it didn't give me high hopes for everyone else I would meet during the rest of the trip. Fortunately, everyone else seemed pretty normal, so I guess she was just an isolated outlier.  \n\nEdit: formatting\n",

I took a picture...\n\nIt was obvious it was a mistake, but it did say $20, so I went to the cash register and sure enough, it rang at $179.98.\n\nI showed them the sign, showed them my picture, and reminded them that in Québec, the law says (I paraphrase):\n\n\"If a product does not have a price tag and the automated price check doesn't match the display price, the customer can get the first item with a reduction of $10 off the lowest price, or if the item is less than $10, get it free.\".\n\nThere are exceptions (namely clothes, medication, alcohol, tobacco and other products with a minimum price tag like Milk). A snow blower isn't one of them...\n\nSo, I thus politely demanded that I get my snow blower for $10.\n\nI remained polite, and patient. I stepped aside to let other customers go, but soon enough, 5 other customers were also waiting for their snowblower at $20 (only I would get it at $10)...\n\nIt took over 30 minutes for them to agree, but I got my snowblower for $10, and each other person got it for $20.\n\nI remained calm, but one of the other guys was getting angry and cursed at the employees. I tried to calm him down.\n\n",

        "text": "Prepare for a wall of text. TLDR at bottom. \n \nI purchased a $600 couch back in August from a popular furniture company. Now, I know that is not a lot in terms of furniture, and don't expect it to last my lifetime. However, you'd expect it to be of at least decent quality! Nope. Two weeks after taking delivery, the seams of the couch were coming undone in three separate locations, as well as a scuff in the upholstery from where the packaging had been carelessly taped. A claim was filed, and they agreed it should be replaced. Three weeks later we took delivery of a new couch. I thought maybe we just got a bad apple...\n\nFast forward two months, one of the armrests started to collapse. The frame was cracking, causing it to dip. I called the company that held the warranty, who said it wasn't their problem and to contact the company who sold the item. So I did, who told me that it was entirely incorrect. Their warranty only comes into effect after the initial 1 year warranty expires. Not sure if the rep I spoke with at didn't know what they were talking about, or just downright lied. Regardless, life got crazy, and because it was at the very back of the armrest, right where it meets the backing of the couch, it wasn't too high up on my to-do list to jump through more hoops. Until the other armrest collapsed a few months later.\n\nNow, I had two broken armrests on either side of the couch. I pulled the couch from the wall and turned it over to see if I could look at the extent of the damage. When I looked at the underside of the couch, I noticed that all of the foam on the seats and some of the backing was missing. I then recalled that over the past few months I had to vacuum (what I thought was dust) a significant amount of gray particles under the couch. I looked, and confirmed the gray particles was the foam padding on the couch! The padding was literally falling out and disintegrating. In other words, I had two broken armrests, and little to no padding on the couch. Fed up with the broken product, I decided to call again.\n\n* 4/29 I called and spoke with a representative who said I needed to start a new claim, and would have to submit pictures (though she admitted if all the damage was internal it likely wouldn't show on the pictures). I submitted the pictures on the same day, and was told that in 24-48 hours someone would reach out to me with next steps. \n\n* 5/5 Never received a call, so I followed up. Was told no one had even looked at pictures. Asked for a manager to do so while I was on the phone. They did so, and confirmed it looked broken. Told warranty department would call in 24-48 hours.\n\n* 5/10 Still never received a call. Followed up, and was told my case was assigned to a contract repair company.\n\n* 5/15 Incoming call by repair company. No available appointments until 5/31, because only one tech services the entire area. Confirmed earliest appointment for that day.\n\n* 5/31 Tech arrives and confirms both frame issues, and finds a new one. Also, shows that foam is mostly missing. Calls repair company, who tells him a replacement is not authorized. Tech informs me of this, and tells me he's sorry but he can only add padding, frame issues won't be fixed but warranty company will follow up with me.\n\n* 6/1 Email from saying my case is closed/solved. I call them and inform them this is false. They deny any knowledge of frame issue, despite acknowledging that it was noted in the original complaint. Manager Alecia says I need to resubmit pictures for review, and will be contacted in 72 hours at the latest.\n\n* 6/6 More than 120 hours have passed. I call, who again say my pictures haven't been reviewed yet. I request a manager, but rep Irma tells me \"none are available.\" Now waiting another 24 hours to be contacted. \n\n* 6/7 (910 AM) Christina (Warranty Manager) called and told me that a refund was not possible. My only options was to either replace the item or get issued store credit. I requested to speak with her manager; none were available. Convenient, 2nd day in a row no managers are in the office! She told me she'd open an escalation and DeLeon, the Senior Operations Manager would contact me in under 24 hours, though he should be in the office at 930 AM. Additionally, he does not have a direct phone line.\n\n* 6/7 (950 AM) Called to see if DeLeon was available, but he's still not in the office. This employee believed he'd be in at 1030 AM.\n\n* 6/7 (1040 AM) Called again. Jackie told me DeLeon wasn't answering his line. She didn't know if he was in the office. I asked to be transferred to his extension, and left DeLeon a voicemail asking him to call me between 3 and 5 PM that afternoon, or to email me to set up a time to speak this week if he couldn't call me then.\n\n* 6/7 (5 PM) Never received contact from DeLeon. Called and spoke with Destiny, who was so far the only employee who actually cared enough to take on my case. She told me she'd call me tomorrow morning personally, after she spoke with DeLeon, and would let me know when to expect another contact. I asked her about the escalation Christina said she would create, and Destiny confirmed to me that too was a lie - no escalation was created, and if I had not called again, no further progress would have been made. Another failure and lie, this time from a manager (Christina). \n\n* 6/8 (10 AM) Destiny called me, letting me know she'd be speaking with DeLeon when he comes in (doesn't seem to work very long hours, as a Senior Manager, but I digress), and that they'd review my case and he'd call me in under 24 hours. She again apologized, and so far, she's the only one I believe actually cares about this atrocious experience I've had.\n\n* 6/8 (415 PM) DeLeon finally called me. He apologized for my experience, but stated policy doesn't allow for a refund, nor can I get credit for anything more than the purchase price of the item. I felt that an exception could be made, due to the numerous lies and mistakes on behalf of his team, and that my time and patience had to be worth something to a national company. His response was, \"We are unable to put a monetary value on your time.\" In other words, they don't care that it's cost me this long, and are unwilling to take ownership of their mistakes. I requested to speak to his manager, but the Director of Customer Service, Sabrina doesn't speak to customers. Guess they don't feel that my time is worth hers, oh well.\n\nTLDR: Good looking products, but are NOT built to last. Customer support is non-existent and employees will even lie to you. If you open a claim with them, they'll never reach out to you, presumably hoping you'll just go away. I'm currently stuck with a broken item only 8 months after purchase, despite having 5-year extended warranty.",

        "text": "Yesterday morning while shopping for my best friend's birthday, I ended up in the DVD aisles of a local grocery store and decided to look for Moana, since I saw it recently and loved it.\n\n\nI wandered for a while and was just starting to think they didn't have it when I saw it and snatched it up. Barely looked at it. Paid for it, got to my car where it got tossed in the glove compartment until my shopping was done.\n\n\nWhen I got home, I still didn't take it out of the bag. I immediately started trying to make galaxy lollipops for my friend (complete disaster much like the rest of the day), took her presents to her house, took her to get her nails done, etc etc.\n\n\nBy the time I got home it was close to 9 pm and I decided to get in my pajamas and watch Moana before bed. Looked at the cover for the first time and, ah, crap, Blu Ray??? I don't have a Blu Ray player. I've never had one. I'm not even 100% sure what Blu Ray is. \n\n\nFor some reason I though an Xbox 360 might play it so I tried it and yeah, nope. I paid almost $30 for a movie I couldn't watch.\n\n\nI was sure their service desk would be closed, and if it wasn't I was sure they'd give me shit for the movie being opened, but I had to try. I was running on pure, bitter exhaustion at this point since introverts are not known for enjoying hectic, socially active days but damn it I wanted to watch Moana.\n\n\nSo I drove back to the store, explained my situation and asked if I could exchange it for a plain old stone age DVD. They were totally ok with that and sent me to get one.\n\n\nThey had absolutely none. Of course. So she refunded me and sent me on my way...\n\n\nI decided in the car that I wasn't going home without Moana. A decision influenced by mania I'm sure. I went to three different stores and all were sold out but the last one.\n\n\nFINALLY got home with Moana around 11:00. Made a bowl of popcorn, changed back into my pajamas and got comfortable. Popped open my Xbox. Oh god. Oh no.\n\n\nYeah, the blu ray disk just chillin in my Xbox. I returned the case and nothing more.\n\n\nNow at my store, it wouldn't have gone this far. The person doing the return would have popped the case, realized [this bitch empty](https://youtu.be/2Bjy5YQ5xPc) and yeeted me out of the building. I assumed all stores would be diligent enough to *at least* check it after I'd left, so I prepared the whole way to defend myself. My anxiety was full steam ahead, concocting scenarios of somehow getting banned from this store and fired from my own store...\n\n\nWell. They hadn't even noticed there was no disk in the case. They were pleasantly surprised and grateful that I came back, and maybe a little unnerved by my impending nervous breakdown, but overall unphased by the fact that they'd let me steal a $30 movie for a few hours...\n\n\nSo anyway that was the first time I've had to return anything and I think it went about as badly as it could have.\n\n\nTL;DR - Unraveling Introvert accidentally buys Moana on Blu Ray instead of DVD. Makes her way back to the store 12 hours later for an exchange after realizing her mistake but the store is sold out. Unraveling Introvert spends two hours unraveling further and searching several stores for Moana on DVD. Finds it, gets home and pops popcorn only to realize she'd returned an empty case. Unravels some more and spends the drive back building a legal defense. Employees are unconcerned. Unraveled Introvert goes home, eats room temperature popcorn, watches Moana, and goes on to stay up much, much later than anyone who has to get up at 6 am should.",

        "text": "Longtime reader, first time poster, etc.\n\nI don't work in retail myself so I had thought I would never have anything to post here. Not so, for sometimes even a customer can notice something worth telling! So without further ado... this is a story about alcohol. \n\nNot booze, mind you, but isopropyl alcohol in the first aid section of a big box store. \n\nIt all started as I was grabbing some bandages and a few other things. It was near 10 PM on a Monday, so no one really wanted to be in the store, least of all the staff I'm sure. The section was mostly empty, but as I checked different items I heard a mumbled apology and a \"no, you're good babe\" from behind me as a well-dressed gentleman and his girlfriend walked into the aisle. He couldn't find what he was looking for and became visibly agitated and flagged down a store employee.\n\n&gt;Hey, excuse me, but how are you sold out of this?\n\nA good start. The employee mumbled an apology but this guy wasn't there to listen. \n\n&gt;Can you really sell out? Can a big store like this really sell out of something? Are you letting someone buy it all? Did someone walk in and buy everything? I use this as hand sanitizer and to wipe down equipment at the gym.\n\nGood to know, guy. Again, the employee started to speak, saying something like \"we can't stop someone from buying what they want to\" but she got cut off again. \n\n&gt;Are they drinkin' it or what? Look, I've been here three times and you've been sold out every time. So, are they drinking it? Are they buying it and reselling it? Can't you stop them?\n\n\"I'm sorry\" the now trapped employee said, and this did stop the guy for a second to say \"it's not your fault\" before picking back up on his rant.\n\nAt this point I walked off and the nattering faded with distance. I needed a few other things but really I didn't want to be anywhere near that mess. But after about five minutes, I strolled back over and heard from the first aid section:\n\n&gt;I mean, are they drinking it?\n\nWhat. \n\nIn the five or so minutes I was gone, the guy hadn't *just* kept talking, he had come full circle back around to his original point. Time well spent.\n\nHe continued for a bit more before finally, *finally* walking off. Certainly a relief for everyone. And this is where the story ended except for one key detail. \n\nRight after and as I was leaving, I saw what inspired me to post this. The same employee was restocking the medicine area...\n\n...with 70% isopropyl alcohol bottles. ",

        "text": "So, years ago, I grew up in a national park. Everyone who lived there knew each other, and I had women who were teachers, and their husbands were part of the park service in various roles. These folks obviously had their own kids, so I wound up growing up with a couple of them.\n\nYears later, I got a job in that same park as a a firefighter. One day while we were checking out a campground/picnic area (just for something to do, mostly)  I run into my old teacher, her husband (who was with me when I bought my first car) and their son ($Chris) and daughter. After a bit of some lighthearted shit talking, I wind up leaving with my engine.\n\nA couple days later I'm driving into work the long way when I get held up in some serious traffic that is not at all normal for my area. I've called my boss and told him I'm going to be way late, and I'll be there when all this shit clears up. A few minutes after that a lady that also worked in the park runs up to my car and asks if I've seen $Chris (son of the family I saw at the picnic area). My heart drops to my stomach and I say no. She nods then keeps running up the line. Eventually the traffic clears up and I pass a horrific looking wreck. I wind up hauling ass to the opposite side of town to the hospital, but am greeted by andother park lady who comes up to me and tells me \"$Chris isn't here\". I finally put 2+2 together, and start driving to mortuary.\n\nHAlfway there I lose my shit, and call into work telling them I'm going to be even later. They tell me don't worry about it, get over there. I roll up, jump out of my car and go inside. Turns out I'm the third person there. $Chris's parents aren't even there yet. Eventually, I feel someone tap me on the shoulder. Turns out it was a clerk from a private \"whole foods\" sort of store a few blocks away. He asks if this is because of the accident, and when I say yes, he pokes his head out the door and says something.\n\nIn comes about 12 employees carrying water, food, Deli stuff, flowers and just a ton of other stuff. It turns out that the owner of the store had heard about the accident, called around, and decided he and his employees were going to take care of nearly everything so the $Chris's parents could focus on the funeral and grieving. I think there were even gift cards in there so that they could just come in and grab whatever they needed. I wound up going back there a few weeks later, and caught a random employee and asked if I could speak to the owner (the look on the poor girl's face when I asked not for a manager, but the dude who owns the place). The owner came down and I told him the whole story and thanked him. It was one of the most caring acts I've ever seen.\n\nA few years later I was working for my uncle on the off season delivering furniture, when we happened to have a delivery to the Grocer's house. After while we were setting the bed up, I mentioned to the owner that I really appreciated what he did back in the day. Most generous person I've ever met.\n\nI realize that this sounds pretty far fetched, so if people are interested, I can give mods proof.",

        "text": "A week ago last Friday my wife and I go to a local restaurant as we were invited by a dear friend and her two teenage children.  We hadn't been to this particular location before but we had eaten at one of their other locations a couple of times.\n\nExcept for an appetizer that consisted of focaccia bread, prosciutto, salt, jam and fresh mozzarella, we didn't find anything remarkable at this chain so we never darkened their doors again.\n\nBut, we were invited and we certainly weren't going to let our hosts know.\n\nSpeaking of them, it's almost half an hour after our agreed time and they haven't shown up. Well it turns out I had forgotten that they asked us if we could meet up the following Friday. Thus, I had to ask for our bill (my wife had a glass of wine) and we left.\n\nFinally, this past Friday rolls around and we get there about fifteen minutes early, get a table ten minutes later and then the fun begins.\n\nOur waiter, Bruno, introduces himself and says that he isn't really important as he won't be taking care of us but is just filling in until Matt finishes stretching the fresh mozzarella. #1 We never see Matt.\n\nMy wife orders a glass of wine, the only Rosé on the wine list.  More than ten minutes pass before the demi carafe arrives. The young woman seems surprised when I point out that this is not what we ordered as it is clearly a red. #2 Order takes a bit of a long time and is wrong.  Bruno eventually gets us the right wine and explains that there are two wines that share part of the same name and only one button to order it. Huh?\n\nOur friends arrive a few minutes later. We take our time catching up and Bruno comes over to take our orders.  My wife orders fish and the rest of us order pizzas. Our friend and her daughter order identical pizzas and her son and I order identical pizzas except for one very key difference - mine is gluten free. Bruno asks if it's a diet preference or an allergy. I explain that I do have celiac disease but fortunately am not sensitive so I'm not concerned with cross contamination. We also add that we should get that famous appetizer I mentioned above. Bruno asks if I want gluten free bread and I'm pleased that it's an option so I thank him for bringing that to my attention.\n\nA good 15 minutes go buy and there is no sign of our cold appetizer. A manager pops in and asks how we are (he seems to be making the rounds) and apologizes for the delay as Matt is still working on the fresh mozzarella. (Matt becomes the butt of our jokes for the rest of the night. We don't know if Matt really exists but it was good for many laughs with Bruno).  \n\nBruno also pops by a few minutes later saying our appetizer should be ready in about 10 minutes.  \n\nJust a few minutes later the appie arrives but they have substituted ALL of the bread with gluten free bread. Now, as I've had years of eating GF bread in many different countries, let me assure you, if you don't have to eat GF, then don't. It's nothing like the good stuff. The gentleman who brought it asks if we want the regular bread and I say yes please as I only thought we would get a single piece for me. #3 Appetizer shows up late and in their effort to accommodate me they ended up depriving everyone else.\n\nWe have just started tucking into the appie when our entrees start arriving. This server (the fifth different wait staff we've seen) is informed as we just received the appetizer we aren't ready for our entrees. We figure they'll put them under some warning lights. We were wrong. #4 Entrees show up disregarding the delay in getting the appetizers to us.\n\nThe manager comes back and apologizes and says that they've dumped the food and will prepare fresh dishes for us. Bruno also apologizes as he will do time and time again.\n\nNow, the funny thing is now that we finished the appetizers we are waiting quite awhile for our new entrees. But, we are having good chats so things are still pleasant.\n\nBruno comes over, explains that some flour accidentally fell onto my pizza so they've had to start over. #5  My order had to be redone a second time.\n\nEventually our entrees arrive. Our friend and her son's arrive first. Then a few minutes later my wife's dish. Then even more  minutes later, our friend's daughter has her pizza arrive. Where is my pizza? #6 Entrees arrive many minutes apart so some people are almost done while others have only started.\n\nMy pizza shows up again from yet another person on the wait staff. I ask her, looking suspiciously at it, if it's gluten free. She replies she didn't have any note stating it was GF. She then goes away, Bruno comes in and checks with us, and I point out the untouched pizza in front of me and my concern it may not be GF. The young lady returns quickly and states that this pizza was for a different table. #7 My Pizza wasn't for me and could have made me pretty ill had I eaten it.\n\nA new manager comes by and apologizes for all of the delays and mix up. He tells us all of the entrees are going to be taken care of for the evening. He also adds they are going to be make my pizza as fast as they can, which turns out to be true.\n\nWhen my pizza arrives, everyone else at the table has finished or just about finished their meals. I cut into the pizza and take a bite. Weird. It's warm at the edges but cold in the middle. I look at it and can't find what could be so cold on this pizza. I take a second bite which is almost frozen. I feel the pizza and it's warm at the edges and almost frozen in the middle. So THAT'S how fast they got it out to me. Didn't even bother to actually cook the frozen crust. #8 Served me uncooked pizza which was apparently their fourth try to get me a pizza.\n\nNow I'm feeling bad for Bruno but I should add that during this entire time everyone was super apologetic and sympathetic and we were having a good laugh about the whole thing. We didn't have any plans the rest of the night so obviously we didn't have that time pressure which would have made the evening quite unpleasant.\n\nSo Bruno comes over only to learn to his horror that the kitchen didn't bother to properly cook my pizza. Since there was no way I was taking any more chances (and frankly their GF bread and crust were pretty bad) I opted for a Caesar salad, without croutons, with grilled chicken and a side order of fries.\n\nIt didn't take too long to get the salad and the fries and they were both quite good and exactly as they should have been.\n\nThe first manager never came over to our table again. He already visited twice and apologized twice.\n\nThe second manager came around again while I was just about finished and said he wanted us to at least eat one thing together at the same time. He added that they would be bringing over some desserts, on the house, for us to share.\n\nSure enough they brought two large selections of half a dozen different desserts including gluten free tartufo. The desserts were so good that there was no clear consensus as to which was best.\n\nBruno came back and said we could go any time we wanted as the entire bill was taken care of. Drinks, appetizer, entrees and desserts.  We asked for the bill because, as I had explained to our hosts, that you should always tip on the pre discounted amount whether using a coupon or being compensated as we were.\n\nSo our friend handed Bruno a nice tip, we had more laughs with him, and we wished each other a nice weekend.\n\nIt was a memorable evening to be sure and it took THREE hours from start to finish.\n\nOh, we are never returning to this restaurant in spite of how nice everyone was and how they dealt with the situation.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "This story took place spring of last year in a local Mexican chain. (Think a big city with multiple store locations.) My boyfriend and I wanted some delicious burritos so we stopped by.\n\nThis place is small and is manned by one cashier who does the whole cashier thing and gets drinks and cleans up. There's probably one or two cooks in the back. So we arrive, order two burritos, pay. We were the only ones there. Our burritos are brought to us and we dig in because they are truly delicious.\n\nAbout half of the way through my burrito, the cashier says to me from behind the counter, \"Hey, can I ask you a question?\"\n\nI reply, \"Uh... sure.\"\n\n\"Where do you get your hair done?\"\n\nI tell her. It's back in my hometown about two hours away so I doubt she knows it, and it's not like it's a fancy place or anything. She asks for my stylist's name so I tell her.\n\n\"Okay, well, I'm studying to be a hairstylist, and next time you go see [name] tell them to put more purple shampoo in your hair next time. It's super yellow.\"\n\nI put my burrito down and kinda glare a bit. My natural hair color is practically black and I bleached it blonde and had it that way for about two years. At this point, it is very obvious looking at my hair I hadn't been to the stylist in awhile. (Two inch black roots, needed to be toned a bit... obvious!) \n\nSo I just reply, \"Uh huh, okay.\"\n\nShe then said, \"And you need to get your roots done too!\"\n\nI snapped back, \"Well, I'm dyeing it back to my natural color next month so it doesn't really matter but thanks.\"\n\nShe said some other insults towards my hair I can't quite remember but my boyfriend was seething and started answering for me. We finished our burritos while making those \"Are you fucking kidding me?\" faces at each other and left.\n\nI still regret not calling the manager to complain about her, but I doubt she even works there anymore, y'know, she's a big hot-shot stylist now!\n\nI seriously wonder why she thought that was okay to say to me. Really irritates me even today. I miss being blonde a lot but I'm thankful I don't have to deal with comments on it anymore.",

        "text": "So normal stuff here - LTL, FTP, etc. \n\nThis happened a couple months back but has stuck with me. My mom and I went to big box department store that has generic credit card offering. You know the type - the employees are expected to upsell the credit card at each purchase. So here's what went down. \n\nWe made a purchase at one register with no problems. We wound up browsing a bit more and found something else my mom wanted, so we go to a different register to check out. Clearly I have a bag from the store in my hands, so lady should have recognized that we'd already been given the credit card spiel once today. \n\nShe asks my mom if she has a CC. Mom says no. Lady then starts talking up the CC like it's the most wonderful thing ever. Oh, did you know you can turn around and pay it off as soon as you've made your purchase? Gee, no, who would think to do something like that, lady? And you get X percent off on purchases, plus coupons, plus special events for our very special CC customers. My mom kept saying no, and she argued with her about this stupid credit card. \n\nFinally I think we made her mad, and she said, \"Well, it will save you money in the long run. You do the math.\" Then she gave us an example with some kind of crazy voodoo math that doesn't add up in any math class I've been in. \n\nBut wait! She didn't stop there. She went on to tell us about a great event coming up for their very special CC customers (TM) this weekend. They were doing a sales event with proceeds going to a certain charity, and isn't that nice? Mom wasn't impressed. She's done her research on said charity and has never been pleased with their lack of transparency and actual help to people in need. She said as much to sales lady, who actually argued that my mom was wrong. \n\nNow what mom researched is well documented about this charity, and it really made me angry that this woman was so patronizing and rude to my mother. I tried to convince my mom to let us flag down a manager to complain, but she wouldn't. So we left, but I did speak to a store manager later that week. \n\nThe manager knew what woman I was talking about when I described her and the department she was in. He said she's usually one of their best at getting CC customers, but he also admitted to getting complaints about her before, too. Go figure. \n\nI understand retail employees sometimes have to try to get numbers on stupid things like credit cards, but when your customer says no, leave it alone. Certainly don't try to make the customer feel belittled and patronized about not taking it. And don't argue with someone when they tell you they've done their research! I mean, really? ",

        "text": "I was reminded of this by another post about a businessman...I was going to make this a comment but I didn't care for that post too much so I decided to post it as a separate story.\n\nSeveral years ago my wife and I were heading back from Las Vegas on a fully booked red-eye.  After we were seated I noticed a disturbance, about five rows ahead of us, between a seated middle aged guy in a business suit and a young girl (late teens, early twenties) standing in the aisle.  Once a flight attendant got involved I came to understand that the airline had over-booked the flight.  It was a ticketed seat type flight, not general seating and both the girl and the businessman had been assigned the same seat.\n\nThe FA told the girl to wait and she would see what could be done.  For the next five minutes the business guy was saying, loudly and to no one in particular, things like \"it's first come first serve\" and \"I got the seat first so they can't make me leave\".  Meanwhile the poor girl is saying nothing but is visibly fighting back tears as she believes she will be bumped from the flight.  Finally a few minutes after everyone has settled in the original FA comes back.\n\nFA (to girl):  We had a cancellation in first class, if you'll come with me we are upgrading you for free for the inconvenience.\n\nBusinessman (shoots out of that seat he was so proud of getting to first as if a rocket was shoved up his ass) THAT'S NOT FAIR!  WE BOTH WERE ASSIGNED THIS SEAT!  YOU HAVE TO FLIP A COIN YOU CAN'T JUST...\n\nFA (sternly to business guy) SIR!  You WILL sit down at ONCE or I WILL have you removed from this plane for causing a disturbance.\n\nBusinessman meekly sits back down, very ecstatic young woman follows the TA thanking her profusely.  I wasn't the only one who started clapping.",

When I going to pay there are 2 people in front of me in the line (one of them being the businessperson), not a big deal I can manage to wait, since my train wasn't going to leave for another 5 minutes or so. But the people that were working there decided to open up another register that was closest to me. I just went to the register first since I was closer, but the businessperson wasn't going to have anything of it.\n\nB: Dude, why can't you let me go before you since I was in front of you in this line?\nMe: Well, because I got here first and my train leaves in 5 minutes.\n\nHe still goes on and on about why he should go first before the cashier just takes my order/items, even though B is trying to get his items first.\n\nC: He got here first and his train leaves in 5 minutes, so just let it go and let him pay for his stuff then you can do it.\nB: Well as I have said many times now, I was in front of him in the other line so I should be in front of him now to.\n\nHe also said that he have to get to his flight and if he missed it he was going to miss a big deal. (Also FYI at this point the other register had already been \"closed\")\n\nMe: Well my train leaves in 3 minutes, so unless your plane leaves in 2 minutes, or less, I have to pay first. But then again if your plane leaves in 2 minutes, or less, you shouldn't even be here. Also if you have that little of a time to by one soda, why not just do it in one of the shops in the terminal.\nB: I don't care that your train leaves in 3 minutes. I was in front of you in the other line and I need to go before you now.\nC: (looks at me) Give me your things and I will get you going atleast.\n\nAfter that he basically just put his stuff away and left the store. So I am thankful that the cashier was having none of it either and was helpful.",

        "text": "This happened a couple of weeks ago.\n\nI've had some serious health issues of late, and I've been feeling really unhappy about it all. My foot surgery was the next day, so to pamper myself I visited my local makeup store to buy a bunch of stuff to make myself feel better.\n\nI talked to a sales associate who said she'd be happy to help me buy everything. She sat me down, took my shopping list and went on her merry way. I sat there people-watching and hating my stupid aching foot. A short time later, she returned with my items all wrapped and packed up already, took my card, rang me up, and even ordered the item that was out of stock for me from their website (with free shipping!) so I didn't have to do it myself. Super-awesome! \n\nShe then showed me I had been chosen to give her a review so I sat there for an extra 5 minutes writing out a glowing review for her. I limped to my car, feeling pampered and happy, and drove home. \n\nWhen I got home it felt like Christmas! Excitedly I unpacked and unwrapped everything, and I couldn't wait to slap all the new makeup on my face and look pretty. What I found in the bag, was all wrong. \n\n***Every single item the sales associate got for me, including the online item, was the wrong fricking color.*** \n\nThe list I gave her was a printout from the store's own website, with the correct SKU, brand, color number, everything. Nope, not a single item was the right one. I compared the receipt with my list three times thinking I had made a mistake. Nope. She sold me 6 items I could not use, the day before I wouldn't be able to walk for a week (at best). \n\nI was livid and it was already too late in the day to go back to the store to return it all. I trusted her to get me the items on my list, and she let me down. I should have checked to make sure everything was correct, but I didn't because I was in pain, and I feel stupid for trusting her. Seriously, how do you fuck up at your job this badly?\n\nOh, and I have to have surgery again this Tuesday. Awesome, right?",

We seldom get to spend time together nowadays so we went to a very nice expensive hole in the wall bistro known for steaks and cocktails. \n\nWe ordered our drinks and while looking at our menus began hearing an interesting conversation from the couple behind us. It was an older woman and man. The waitress was trying to recommend a wine to them and the older woman kept asking for wine samples but didn't seem to like any. \n\nOlder woman \"Where's your gluten free menu?\"\n\nWaitress \"I'm sorry miss I'm unsure if we have one. Let me step to the back to chat with our chef. Is there something you had in mind that you wanted me to check on?\"\n\nOlder woman \"This seafood dish.\" *I'm assuming she pointed because I'm not staring directly at them*\n\nWaitress \"Let me go back to check. What can I get you in the meantime?\"\n\nOlder man orders a beer\n\nOlder woman \"We need bread.\"\n\nWaitress \"Ok. I am sorry but we do not offer gluten free bread.\"\n\nOlder woman \"Whatever, just bring us bread.\"\n\nAt this point my friend and I have ordered and are really enjoying some amazing Sidecars. \n\nWaitress comes back \"Miss I'm sorry but the Seafood Étouffée does have flour in the sauce. So it's not gluten free.\"\n\nOlder woman sighs and says \"ok well I guess I'll try it anyway. Is there any way you can make it without the gluten?\"\n\nWaitress \"No Miss I'm sorry but you could try....\"\n\nOlder woman \"uh whatever get me that.\"\n\nMy friend also ordered the seafood étouffée. I got a steak. \n\nWe both were deeply involved in our own conversation so we didn't hear what happened when the couple abruptly stood up and walked out. \n\nOur waitress walked over and asked how our food was. We both loved it and told her so. She turns to my friend \"The Seafood Étouffée is not too spicy is it?\"\n\nMy friend laughed \"It had a bit of kick but nothing I wouldn't expect from a dish from Louisiana.\"\n\nThe waitress looked a bit harried. \"I'm only asking because we had another customer say it was far too spicy to be on the menu. I just wanted to get another opinion.\"\n\nWe just laughed. After she left we wondered what the couple behind us had said to her to freak her out about that dish. \n",

        "text": "So my best friend lives about an hour and a half away from me. She used to live here and on occasion she comes back home and we reunite for several hours for laughs and catch up time. After a day of shopping and hanging out we decide last minute how great it would be to get In N Out and have some wine. We are not huge wine drinkers so by wine, I mean Stella Rosa. We have not had one drop of alcohol that day and were happy to have some at home to enjoy.\n\nBut I digress. We decide to go to a certain market that starts with a V (that is frequented/mostly run by Mexicans, my friend is Salvi and I am SE Asian). For backstory, a lot of people think that if you're not Mexican that you'll get judged pretty badly in this store. In my experience I've noticed the cashiers were never nice no matter how sweet I was to them but I always thought maybe they just hated their jobs. Also, a lot of people tend to think that Mexicans and El Salvadorians hate each other. Clearly this is just speculation, but my friend insisted she's had problems in her life because of that in the past.\n\nSo we see they're doing some kind of special, I think 2 bottles for $15. We grab two bottles and some candy and we chat happily to ourselves, excited to have wine and greasy burgers. The cashier immediately looks us up and down and takes my friend's ID that she already had out and ready to go (we are both well over 21 but we do look young which is why she had it ready because we're used to people asking). We're smiling, polite as can be when she rolls her eyes and says, \"Sorry, I can't let you buy these.\" And she sets them to the side. We laugh thinking she's kidding and say something to the effects of ha ha very funny but we realize her face is serious and quite smug. \n\nObviously we ask why and she says that she can't legally sell us alcohol when she thinks we've been drinking. We are both shocked because as I mentioned before we hadn't had a drop and when we came in we weren't causing a ruckus to imply we've been drinking. We tell her we haven't drank at all today but she insists she believes we've been drinking. There were other customers and cashiers near watching- so in shock, we say ok and leave the line. We're both taken aback and honestly as we were walking away we were getting very angry. We didn't get to see each other often and it was our day to have fun, enjoy each other's company, and treat ourselves. \n\nIt was such a strange situation that we sat in the car just going over it together. We were embarrassed and angry that this woman had the gall to refuse us for no reason.. we clearly weren't drunk-we didn't even smell of alcohol! Anyways we get so upset that we go back in there to speak to a manager. \n\nDisappointingly, things did not change much with him. He  sided with his cashier, going on for ten minutes about how they could lose their liquor license if they sold to people who were already intoxicated. He said he did not think we were drunk so I asked him, \"OK then can we buy it NOW?\" He said yes. Honestly I don't know why we wasted time at this store, we should have just left but we got back in line. Her line. She looked at us with a smile you won't believe. She probably thought in her head that she could reject us a second time. We walked up to her counter and politely gave her the ID again. At this point the manager came to stand by her and in Spanish (thinking we didn't speak it, but my friend does HA) she says to him, \"I already told them I'm not selling them alcohol.\" To which he replies \"It's okay, just sell it. If it becomes a problem, we'll call the cops.\" She looked annoyed but rung us up.\n\nUnfortunately, my friend just got really pissed off and told me she'll tell me later what they said. As we walked away she gave me the translation and I was livid. I told her we should've said to call the cops. We didn't do anything wrong.. we left feeling pretty defeated. We were having such a nice day and this lady for no reason wanted to ruin it. We were so upset that we did speculate that she did it because of our race but obviously there's no way to prove it. \n\nTo this day, I refuse to shop there. My friend still goes but she's never tried to purchase alcohol again. ",

Currently, I am on vacation and visiting my parents because they are both in poor health right now.  (My father was hospitalized Sunday)  Therefore, electronics is a necessity.  Well on Sunday I was playing on my phone and calling people, etc. and my phone died.  Oops.  So I plugged it in to charge and went to grab food while my phone charged on the counter.  When I returned I grabbed my phone and put in my password. \n\nPassword incorrect.  What?  I enter it again and again and yet again.  Until I was locked out. I didn't understand I had not changed my password and my phone had not been tampered with.  Confused I entered in my fruit Id in order to reboot my phone. Only that password was incorrect as well.  Wth is going on?  I then borrowed a phone and call customer service and am told to do the same steps I've already done.  After running in circles for almost an hour I'm told that nothing can be done and I need to apply for a reboot and it will take up to three weeks.  \n\nYes, three weeks to reboot my phone and fruit id. So I will have to function without any electronic devices for three weeks when they will restore my service but not any of my data everything will be wiped.  I'm obviously upset as this is unacceptable and I need to be in contact with people as I am away from home and my father is in the hospital. I am then told to get my proof of purchase and if I bring it to a fruit store they can expedite the process.  Okay.  \n\nCue me driving an hour to the closest provider aof my phone company and then to the fruit store.  Upon arrival they inform me that I need to take all the steps I've already taken.  Once past that hurdle they inform me there is nothing I can do and I have to contact fruit corporate.  Awesome.  So, I drive back to my parents house and call corporate.  They inform me that I need to send in a copy of my receipt and in three days they will wipe my phone back to factory settings.  Then I have to wait ten to twenty business days for them to reset my fruit id.  \n\nWait, can I make calls? Text? Anything?  Nope.  Not until after the reset in ten to twenty days.  So what am I supposed to d until then?  Well, most people buy another phone to use.  What?!  No I have already paid almost $1,000 for the phone I already have that is now a paperweight.  I explain that this is unacceptable since this is obviously a defect on their end as I didn't magically change my passwords.  The tech tells me he realizes that people keep most of their lives on their phone.  I asked him if it would be acceptable to him if I took his phone for a month just for no reason and he tells me that I could have his phone as it isn't that important to him.  Seriously?!  Wtf?!  At this point I'm livid but I'm not being rude or shouting but I let him know I'm angry.  He tells me that three weeks isn't that long. Then after three weeks I'll have my phone back \"as good as new\".  Yeah no duh it will be like brand new because it will be completely blank.  \n\nI'm so angry.  He then tells me the more information I can give the better my chances are of getting it done sooner (10 days instead of 20 business days of course). I tell him I can give my social security number any other information he needs heck I can give him my birthweight if that expedites the process!  So now I'm stuck with no phone, no way to contact anyone and most likely I won't have service for the rest of the month.  Absolutely ridiculous.  \n\nTo;dr;  fruit suddenly changes all my passwords for no apparent reason then says I have to wait almost a month or buy a new phone in order to make calls until their system okays me to have service back.  Service representative makes a mockery of my need for keeping in touch with my family.  ",

I went to a chain auto repair shop in my town. \n\nAll in all I was in this shop for 45 mins. Staff was friendly, seemed knowledgeable. I drove away happy. They told me there was no damage done and to come back in a few weeks for an alignment. \n\nWell last Thursday after 20+ days of driving on my summer tires and being careful to avoid all potholes, my car sounded like a train, it was shaking. There was definitely something wrong with my front end. I had my vehicle towed to a different shop in town and was told that whoever changed my tires did not put the front drivers side wheel on properly and now I had $1000 damage done to my front end he told me it was a good thing I stopped driving it when I did or I could have had a serious accident. \n\nI have tried calling corporate for the repair shop that did the tire change. I have emailed them, and no resolution has been offered to me. Am I wrong to feel like they should cover the cost for this? \n",

And your license please\"\n\nI hand him both of these and he processed the return.

        "text": "I've worked in retail for three years now, (only women's clothes, different price points and stores though) and this is a tale from when I was the customer in the situation.\n\nA few years ago during Black Friday, I went to my favorite store to see what deals they were offering. After trying on a few pairs of pants and a few tops, I decide to buy a pair, but I want to order it through them because I want to get them in the 'Tall' (longer length) option AND use my student discount on top of the Black Friday promo. I was gonna get $130 jeans for like $70 dollars. An associate helps me order it, lets me even ship it to the store, and everything was taken care of.\n\nFast forward to the next week. I pick up the pants after work and go home to try them on (I lived like right next to the shopping center). Sadly, with the pants having the longer length, it has completely changed the fit throughout the whole leg and doesn't work anymore.\n\nThe next day, I go to the shop with my invoice and pants and ask to do an exchange for the regular length of the pant. Mind you, the Black Friday promo is over. They have my size, and the associate who is helping me has been amazing this whole time. She rings up the return and scans the new pair of pants and says:\n\nAssociate: After everything, you owe $20.\n\nThis threw me off. I wasn't getting a different pair of pants, I wasn't getting something all together different, I was just exchanging sizes. \n\nMe: Uh, I'm just exchanging sizes. I'm not getting something different. This is a straight across exchange.\n\nAssociate: Well, the Black Friday promo is over. \n\nMe: I realize, but I'm not getting something different. I'm literally exchanging a pant in a size 27 TALL, for a size 27 REGULAR. Not even a different pant.\n\nMind you, I haven't raised my voice. I work in retail, I understand customers suck, but I'm not gonna pay $20 because the promo is over. \n\nAt this point, the associate gets visibly angry. She goes \"FINE\" and throws her hands in the air, applies the discount (so I don't have to pay no money) and slams the pants on the counter. When the receipt prints she tosses it on the pants, and doesn't say a word to me throughout the rest of the transaction and as I leave.\n\nI get that I pushed her for that discount, but at the same time, she was acting like this sale was personally affecting her and how her day was gonna go. (which it wouldn't be anyways, because I ordered it online with a different associate, so wasn't like she was losing commission from this return). I may be wrong, but I was surprised how quickly she angered over this interaction.\n\nTL;DR does an exchange, associate freaks out",

        "text": "My friend and I would take long walks at insane hours of the night during our college years. This particular night, we walked around at about 3:00 am, just wandering our town. I was a little peckish, and decided we should hit up the local small grocer that was open 24 hours. We walked in, and were greeted by the usual and friendly \"hello\" by one of the cashiers. We were not the only ones in the store; there was a couple other, older looking adults scattered around the store. \n\nWe were walking up and down the aisles looking for something small to nibble on, and we stopped in the magazine/Hallmark Cards aisle to continue browsing. My friend was looking at magazines, I was looking at the cards.\n\nWe were not being loud at all, in fact, I hate bringing attention to myself anywhere public. We were silent when the older shelf stocker woman approached us:\n\nWoman: \"Can I help you two find anything?\"\n\nMe: \"No, we are just looking around, thanks.\"\n\nWoman: (In a very snotty, threatening voice) \"Exactly, just looking. That's loitering. You'll have to buy something, or leave.\"\n\nShe left us after saying that, and my friend and I left immediately shocked that anyone would say that.\n\nNow here's my two cents about the whole thing: I have a really hard time believing that that woman would have said that to an older adult. Since it was late at night and we were young adults, she probably assumed we were up to no good, when really I just wanted to stuff my face. \n\nThe next day my friend called the store to speak to the manager, who was apologetic and offered us coupons. We continued to shop there, though. ",

I have returned lingerie items to this store before.\n\n\nSo, I go in and am instantly greeted by a employee about my age, but male. He asks if I need help and I say \"well actually I have a return to make!\" And he asks to see the merchandise. I pull it and the receipt out of my large purse, and the following ensues.\n\nHim: \"oh no, you can't return that here.\"\n\nMe:\"well-\" he cuts me off\n\nHim: \" we do not accept items we do not have in store, and we only have certain items from that line\"\n\nMe:\"well, I've returned things like this here before that you didn't sell.\"\n\nHim: \"they shouldn't have returned them\"\n\nMe: \"ok that's more understandable\"\n\nSo he explains I can exchange it, which I don't want. \n\nHim: \"here, let me pack it up for you to ship out\"\n\nI didn't really need him to do this, but he is holding my item so I just go with it. I follow him to the counter where he conscendingly says \"seeee? It comes with a FREE shipping label, and you stick this thing outside on the bag and then clooooose it, and they'll give you the money back when they get it.\" As if I've never shipped anything back in my life. \n\n\nSo I leave, but somehow I can't accept what he said. So I look up their return policy on their website and it is worded vaguely but it seems to say what I thought: you can return any of their products in store. So I email the company to double check that I'm right. \n\n\nEmailed back within 1 day: \"Paigenotcasey,\n\n              \n\nThank you for reaching out to COMPANY! We absolutely accept returns in our MAIN stores for LINGERIE BRAND Merchandise. The only time we would deny a return is if fraud or abuse was suspected. Can you let us know which store this was that denied the return so we can reach out to them promptly?\"\n\n\nI replied and plan to go back in tomorrow to return it in person, email proof in hand.

I was so disgusted I failed to point out the fact that she was wearing a cardigan to combat the air conditioner positioned directly above her head. The bagger sent me a piteous glance before I was able to regain some of my senses. I managed a weak bark of a laugh, paid for my items, and left.\n\nThe ice cream, like my dreams, went straight into the garbage. When I called later that night to complain to a manager, the counter person was hardly believing. I didn't blame her. She told me to bring it back in but I didn't want to relive the trauma.\n\nI haven't purchased that brand of ice cream since. \n\nEDIT: Yes, I understand that not purchasing the ice cream since is irrational. I also understand that the ice cream was in a sealed container and I have no idea what happened to it beforehand. \nThis happened a year ago and I thought it would be funny to share here.

They offered to replace the drone for a 30% discount, this was a contrast the box's \"let us know if it breaks! We'll replace it for free!\" The problem is that the drone is a cheap one, and I want to refund it more than I want it replaced, so I kept lobbying for the 100% free replacement, or a refund. I told the rep that If it gets replaced at no charge I'll continue operating the drone, but my problem is I don't want to spend anymore money on this particular drone. I continued with telling the rep that it really upset me that the packaging advertises it as a beginner drone, and they also advertise free replacements to incentivize the users to keep operating after they run into problems, but it seems that they don't want to keep their word in the end (this wasn't my exact wording at the time, just couldn't remember). The back and forth emailing continued for a week or two, and now finally the rep said \"you have monopolized too much of my time, you cannot be helped\". I tried reminding the rep that I could take the discount, but he replied back \"that will no longer be an option\" then the rep proceeded to terminate my support ticket, and now I cannot talk to the company over email.

        "text": "So this weekend my neighborhood had a community sale. I am out walking about when I come up on a yard sale that has a row of strollers. We are going on vacation with a lot of walking this summer, so this seems like the perfect opportunity to pick up a light weight stroller on the cheap. If this thing gets stolen or destroyed I will not care.\n\nI ask because none of them have prices. Five bucks for the one I want. Cool. I pay him and go about looking at the other stuff. At this point his wife comes out with more stuff and notices me with the stroller. She comments to her husband that was quick and asks how much he got for it. Promptly goes ballistic on him. Like in a way I have never seen  anyone do to their spouse over a few dollars.\n\n\"FIVE DOLLARS? FIIIIIIVE DOOOOOLLARS? IT IS WORTH MORE THAN THAT YOU IDIOT!!\" \n\n*(honestly it is one of those cheap ones you get new for 20 to 30 bucks. The Rolls Royce of strollers it is not.)*\n\nShe keeps calling him various names while he just seems to stand there and take it, nodding all the while. People are chased off by the display and I honestly have no idea what to say or do. It was a shocking display over something so small. I didn't want to leave the guy on his own in case she started wailing on him and he needed help or a witness. Overall he seemed pretty use to this.\n\n For the next part she was talking about me like I wasn't standing right freaking there.\n\n\"Well I was trying to sell them all as a set *(I don't get that part. You wanted to sell 4 different strollers all together in bulk? Who does that?).* You are gonna have to go get it back or she will have to pay the difference to split up the group.\"\n\nAt that point I am like... whatever fuck this crazy mess. There are other guys at the house next door out on their lawn now so I figured I am good to go. I've paid so buh bye. I noticed the husband is not too far behind. I thought he was chasing me down at first, but he is nice enough to say don't worry I am not coming for you, I just need to leave. Turns out he was going to his car. She is still going on about how stupid he is and how dare he leave her to do all this by herself up in the driveway. Ignores me leaving,  even though I have the magical stroller that started all of this crazy. I walk my happy ass back home and drop the stroller off. Go back out, but stay closer to my side of the neighborhood. \n\nFound him at another yard sale drinking with the guy running that one. He realizes it is me and apologized for the scene. We joked about what kind of person was going to buy a group of mismatched strollers. Then with all seriousness he said: \"Fuck community sale day.\"\n\nIndeed.\n",

        "text": "I've just been reminded of the time I received the worst customer service online ever.\n\nSo, around a year ago I was hunting for some pop figures for my boyfriend's birthday present (we were trying to get them for his b'day on the 14th but it would be alright if it was a few days late), and I stumbled upon an online pop culture store - let's call them dookie. This store was selling the pops I was after for decent prices and the shipping cost was great, ended up costing me $78 for a large pop, 2 regular sized pops and another little trinket I wanted for myself.\n\n\nIt's the 6th of August and I make my order. I pay through 'MoneyFriend' and I get a confirmation email and all seems well. The site outlined that orders would take 1-3 business days to be shipped and then shipping time was dependent on where you were located (we were both in the same smallish country so I wasn't expecting any longer than a week and a half total).\n\n\nOn the 11th of August I go onto the site and check my order status - still processing. I use the messaging feature on the site to send a message pretty much saying 'hey, just wondering when abouts this order can be expected to be shipped?'. This was when I realized that the site was not that great past the store and ordering pages, the messaging feature didn't really seem to actually work and there was no way of checking your sent messages or anything. The FAQ and other pages were pretty bare and weren't designed well. Red flag #1.\n\n\nAugust 12th and there was no reply to the message on the site. I look up the business page on facebook and send a message on there since it's labelled as 'replies quickly' or something. The facebook page has &lt;50 likes (and still does to this day), red flag #2. I send off a message to the facebook page saying the same thing as my other message. I get a message back saying \"hi yes your order will get to you by tuesday\" (16th of Aug). Red flag #3. \n\nAnyway, I wait till the afternoon of the 16th and still the order is 'processing' - no 'shipped' status. I send another message, longer one this time: \"Hi there, I placed an order from your site on the 6th of August (order #1159) and the website says it's still processing - I sent a message about it last week and you mentioned it'd arrive by today but it hasn't even been marked as shipped yet on the site. I was just wondering if it has been shipped yet but hasn't been updated on the site yet or if it still hasn't been shipped when can we expect it to be shipped? Thanks\"\n\n\nI get a reply half an hour later saying \"Hi u should be getting your pops by the end of the week. Unfortunately being based in [city in the crap side of our country]. Shipping does take a little longer\" \nI reply back in the same minute saying \"Okay thanks for your reply, just was wondering if it actually has been shipped yet or not?\" No response for the rest of that day, or as you will soon discover, ever. Too many red flags.\n\n\nThe next day we decide to look more into this business. We discover that the whole show is just run by this one guy that we could find easily on facebook, and from what we saw, he seemed like a pretty odd guy. On his business page, the only way to contact him seemed to be a mobile number and fb messenger - no business email, no work phone, nothing helpful. The page also showed a store address, but when we did a bit of searching around this address there was no records of it ever belonging to 'dookie' and no mentions of the guy's name either, when looking on google maps it was the bottom floor of a large unrelated company building and all there was at the bottom were cafes. \n\nOver the next week we keep messaging his page, all the messages are marked as seen by him but no replies. We try the phone number listed on the page about 10 times over the week during business hours and it was never picked up, there was a message bank confirming it was the 'dookie' phone number, but the messages we left never got us a call back.\n\nThis takes us to the 22nd of August. We go to the site once again and look for some kind of option for a refund or issue reporting feature, once again nothing. We go to MoneyFriend and open up a dispute and I think we elevated the case either immediately or very soon after by phoning up their support and explaining the situation. They explained to us that the seller had 11 days (from what I remember) to reply to the dispute (either they could accept to pay the refund or supply a tracking number or evidence that they had in fact sent the goods), and if they hadn't replied in that period we would automatically get the $78 refunded to us. \n\n\nSo we waited for that 1.5 weeks patiently, I had sent the page another message on the 22nd informing him that we issued a refund through MoneyFriend and if he could make a reply to it soon it would be appreciated and would make things a lot faster, of course he read it but did not reply and didn't make any sort of action on MoneyFriend...\n\n...until: it's the night of the 2nd of September, at midnight it would be officially an entire 11 days and the refund would go through to us. Sometime between 9pm and midnight this guy had gone on the the case and replied with a tracking number. I think \"huh, okay, he actually sent it, took him literally until the last minute but I guess he did it\". Then I go and search the tracking number through the postal service website to see when he shipped it and where it's at - 'ERROR: Item does not exist.'\n\nI almost blew a fuse. This fraudster had waited right till the last minute of the case and put in a FAKE tracking number just to stop us getting our refund. I have no clue why he would do this, other than just out of spite (if he didn't send the items, it was a given that he would get a refund chargeback, he just wanted to screw us over and make us wait as long as he possible could make us).\n\nIn the morning I call MoneyFriend again, and they confirmed that the tracking number was fake but that it was policy to give another 3 days for them to contact the seller before we got the refund finally. Of course they probably couldn't get anything out of him, so on the 6th of September, I finally had my sweet $78 back in my account. Screw you dookie.\n\n\nBack to the present, his online shop website is down, facebook page seems fairly abandoned, but we found his 'bBay' shop. He's got 26% positive feedback (for anybody who doesn't use bBay, this is an awful rating, some people even refuse to buy from stores with anything lower than a 98%), and the reviews are all pretty much 'never received item/this guy is a scammer/never buy from this fraud'\n\nHopefully now his webstore never comes back and anyone looking at his bBay is warned by the reviews- the only concerning thing is that we were order 1159, did this mean we were the 1,159th buyer? Praying that he started at order #1000 so only fewer than 200 people got scammed before us",

        "text": "Just have to say I am entirely displeased with the customer support I've received from [stupid online company (S.O.C.)]. How you guys are ranked so high is beyond me.\n\nFor starters, I paid for a 6 month subscription a few months back. About a few weeks to a month later, my account was blocked. Anytime I tried signing in, even through [social media account], I was met with a message that said \"blocked by administrator\". I tried e-mailing customer support, but never received a reply. Then I contacted [S.O.C.] through [social media], asking what was going on. They told me it was blocked due to \"security reasons\", and that I would need to create a new account from scratch, using a new e-mail, and they would transfer the subscription to it. Otherwise I could take a pro-rated refund. Here's the first problem. Why couldn't you just verify me through, let's say, a text message or an e-mail, and allow me access to my old account, so I wouldn't have to do everything over? I've never recieved a reason WHY it was blocked in the first place. When I called just today, all the representative could tell me was, \"there was suspicious activity,\" but never told me WHAT that activity was. Did someone try to log on to my account too many times with wrong passwords? If so, couldn't anyone block anyone's account at any time just by having their e-mail? Did someone actually get ACCESS to my account? If so, how and what did they do? I had a password unique to [S.O.C.], with varying caps and numbers. In my eyes, unless given a reason otherwise, it's as likely as any reason [S.O.C.] did it for NO reason. Though I suppose that is in line with your weird Terms under User Content (4-c: \"[S.O.C.] may, at its sole discretion, review, edit, refuse to accept or delete User Content at any time and for any reason or no reason without notice.\")\n\nSecondly, when I finally got my new account up and running, I tried uploading a couple photos. The first one was approved on my last account, and the new one was taken just this past week. Both were deleted and rejected, with accompanying e-mails saying, \"make sure it's clear\" (it was), \"be alone in your photo\" (I was), and \"don't include nudity\" (I didn't). When I called today, the representative told me that they were rejected because they were \"edited\". Nowhere on the website does it say anything about that being a policy when uploading, nor in the e-mails I recieved. Regardless, neither were edited, and (again) the first one was already approved on my prior account. The second one had a watermark on it in the corner, but other than that there was no photoshop (I still had very apparent blemishes on it, for crying out loud. I would've had a much better job done if it was in any way altered.) When I brought THIS up, the representative pointed out the watermark and said, \"it's cropped out. You have to include the whole thing.\" Your website REQUIRES CROPPING when uploading photos. At this point I was fed up. Obviously [S.O.C.] didn't want me to have a profile. I asked for my money back, and the representative told me they weren't allowed to do refunds, completely contradicting the fact that I was offered a refund by the [social media] staff when this whole thing began.\n\nI'm beyond frustrated at this point. I feel like as soon as you got my money all good will went out the window. Since paying I've been denied access to the product, lied to about the terms, and kept in the dark about potential security matters that might affect ME. This is wholly irresponsible for a company, and I hope there's a better fix in mind. I apologize for yelling at your representative, she was doing her job, but know that your entire system is absolutely maddening and backwards.\n\nSincerely,\n[my name]",

        "text": "If you travel a lot, you've probably seen the incredible abuse people in that industry endure. Airline employees, hotel, rental car, people seem to feel entitled to be incredibly rude to them. \n\nI'm at a very, very nice resort in Maui.  Booked for whatever the cheapest room is. I'm at the desk waiting to check in.  The clerk is switching between handling my check in and trying to fix some problem for some very angry guy.\n\nAngry guy is going off about how this is just ruining his family's vacation and he's outraged etc. Clerk is trying to tell him he's doing what he can, but corporate has some rules about blah blah blah. I really wasn't interested in whatever it was. \n\nAngry guy starts getting very personal - insulting the clerk, spewing homophobic stuff (the clerk was an effeminate-acting/sounding man, which I guess made the angry guy attracted or something, who knows).  \n\nHe's just being about the worst human you can imagine. \n\nI said something to the effect of, calm down. This person is trying to help you. He doesn't make the rules. He's doing his best. He's not the CEO, he's a person, and you can complain but treat him with some respect. He's certainly treating you with respect, and I'm amazed at his patience. \n\nWell I was probably a bit more sarcastic in tone than that, but I was trying to be civil - I'm just not very good at that. So the clerk was trying to keep from laughing at this guy, I think in combination of the absurdity of this guy's tirade and relief that he wasn't alone in this. \n\nHe gives me a little smile and says he thinks he can give me a few upgrades. \n\nStarts with the room - I'm now in some special tower with super expensive rooms.  With a lovely exclusive lounge, with free cocktails - top shelf. He turns and gives angry guy a smile. \n\nThen he says he can also give me some spa passes. Gives angry guy a smile. \n\nAnd a $50 a day credit for pretty much anything at the resort - another smile for angry guy. \n\nSo I'm ready for a great vacation. Day two I go to a helicopter tour. I arrive, and the tour people tell me some wealthy family had just shown up with no reservation and offered a ridiculous amount of money to immediately take a tour. So could I possibly come back tomorrow, even though I had a reservation? \n\nSure, no problem. Arrive the next day. Well, since I was nice about it, instead of a 30 minute tour on a six passenger chopper, how would I like an hour and a half in a little chopper, with an ex-military pilot who would show me some amazing stuff. Heck yeah! \n\nWe dropped in to canyons with less than a foot of clearance on either side of the blades, made incredibly close and slow passes over all kinds of spectacular spots, all stuff the pilot said he usually never did, because passengers would get scared. It was incredible. \n\nI really wish I'd tipped the heck out of both that clerk and that pilot, it didn't occur to me at the time. I ended up the happiest customer on the island. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I decided to get her something bubbly to drink at a nearby \"Place with the Golden Arches\".  I pulled up to the drive thru, thinking it would be faster...boy, was I wrong.\n\nThis was one of those \"split\" drive thrus, which allows 2 people to be give their order at the same time before converging back into 1 lane to go around to the pick up windows.  A white Kia (driven by Kia Woman) was already in the other lane, giving her order, so I pulled into the other one.  Since my order was quick (2 sodas), I finished before her and pulled up as far as I could to join the line going around the building.  \n\nIt took a minute or so, but finally the line moved up and I began to lift my foot off the brake to roll forward....but guess who decided she HAD to be before me?  Yup, Kia Woman.  She had just finished her order, hit the accelerator and barged her way in, almost scraping off my front bumper and climbing the curb to get around me.  WTF?!?!?!\n\nDeep breath, Annie...it's okay....  Stupid people are going to stup, right?\n\nBut of course, that's not the end of our story!  We get around, past the money window (where she took her sweet time digging out her credit card) to the food window.  This is supposed to be the \"grab your food and get out!\" moment and I was expecting her to take her food like a nice woman and haul butt out of there.\n\nNope.  \n\nFirst, the clerk tried to hand her 2 sodas (MY sodas).  She took one, and then proceeded to wave her well-manicured left hand in the air as she had a heated conversation with the clerk.  The clerk reached out to take the soda back when Kia Woman opened the top of the cup and unceremoniously dumped the soda all over the pavement between the store and her car.  SPLOOSH!!!  The clerk stood there, dumbfounded at this woman's action.  There was more waving of hands from Kia woman and the poor attendant, looking flustered, did that patented \"hands out-calm down lady\" gesture.  She handed her the correct drink - an iced coffee - and her bag of food.  \n\nI'm thinking \"YAH!! I get to get my sodas and I won't have to listen to my kid whine in the backseat.\"  Nope.  Kia Woman sat there...and sat there...and then she BLARED HER HORN, waved her hands, and banged loudly on the metal pass to get the clerk's attention.  Then she proceeded to have (what felt like) a 5 minute debate with the poor girl, her clawed hand waving maniacally in the air.  My thought was, \"Wow!  Something must be horribly wrong with her food order!\"\n\nFinally, Kia Woman threw her credit card back at the poor girl, who returned it a moment later with 2 additional dipping sauces.\n\nReally?  You did all this to get more dipping sauces?  *sigh*\n\nFor those of you who work at the \"place with the golden arches\", I salute you.  You sure put up with some serious assholes.\n",

Don't know if this really belongs here but it is about a business owner and his kindness\n\nIn high school I didn't really want to go out and do anything or even get my license. I was afraid I would have to pay insurance on my car and have to get a job. Not something I was looking forward to and something I now regret. (i did get it shortly after this) \n\nAnyways so my little brother had his license so he drove us to school on the first day of my senior year in my car. We were pulling out of the parking lot to go home and one of my acquaintances was speeding down from another exit when my brother pulled out in front of them. Metal flew and we spun a few times. My Ford escape totalled this guys new mustang. It was tragic \n\nThe police officer at our school was there in a few moments and everyone was getting checked out by ambulance. Standard stuff for an accident. Our dad shows up and the other guys dad shows up. That guy was pissed. And understandably, his son just got in a wreck in a brand new car. \n\nSo we're all standing around. To get clear of the street we walked over to a little snow cone stand right next door to the school. The guy running it was a round man in his 40s or 30s. Balding with a mobster look to him, even while wearing the Hawaiian shirt. He comes around to us on the outside of the stand with snow cones for both me and my brother. He talks to my dad about a guy he knows for a lawyer and how he would be a witness if we needed it because we pulled out in front but the guy was going what looked like 50 mph in a 30.\n\nThis caused the other dad to go berserk. Veins popping out all over the place. Taking pictures with his phone of us enjoying a treat after viciously targeting his son and loudly exclaiming to an officer about how we should be arrested and on and on. Snow cone man told us to shake it off and enjoy our snow cones. No point in being upset over an accident. \n\nHe really made me feel better. Someone who really tried to take our minds off an accident. I was always a worrier but that man helped me realize that worrying about something that already happened or is inevitable is pointless and I needed to stop and just enjoy what I can, when I can. Doesn't matter what's going on surrounding (most of) the situations. \n\nThe police called us back up and I never got to really say more than a quick thank you to that man. I recommend his place to everyone though and I plan on making a stop there this coming summer. So I can actually be a customer.",

Grab a pint while scrolling through my phone, get in my car, and I'm about to head out of the parking lot when...I realize the ice cream doesn't have a bag. That's odd. Did I ask them for a bag? \n\nWaitas*eco****nd***, I didn't fucking pay for the ice cream. \n\nI go back and sheepishly apologize, checkout girl says I should have just taken it. Lol. \n\nThis is super boring, but I'm curious if any of you have been caught doing so, and what the outcome was. ",

        "text": "Here's my first actual story, and a positive one at that. Recently I was allowed to buy game credit, so I decided to go to a certain big name gaming store that has a negative reputation for many things, its treatment of its employees being one of them. I decided to see if I could buy a physical game for my system at $20 or less, and if I didn't see anything I wanted, I'd get the credit. So I walked in and the employee running the store greeted me and asked what I came for. I told him I was looking for a gamr for a certain system that was at most $19.99 before tax. The employee then walked me to the section with the games, and then offered to show me a list of games I could get. I accepted and browsed the pre-owned games a bit. Then the employee comes back with a custom generated list showing every game for the system I wanted that they had in stock and which was currently priced at $19.99 or less. I eventually went with the credit, but I found it a very nice gesture that the employee had gone to the trouble of printing out a custom list to help me decide what to buy. I hope that employee never becomes tired of his job and continues to provide such excellent service for the other customers.",

We were on our way back home and stopped in a small town at the local fast food chain with a double arch and clown to get a bite to eat.\n\nMe and my friend wait in line and get up to order\n(Me is me, F is friend, C is cashier and E is employee)\n\nMe: Hello, what smoothies do you have?\n\nC: we have (lists smothies, for sake of story let's say smoothie#1, smoothie#2 and smoothie#3)\n\nMe: Ok, I'll have #2 please( keep in mind we have talked about smithies THIS ENTIRE TIME)\n\nC: I'm sorry we don't have #2 but we do have smoothie#2( literally exactly what I just asked for but with the word smoothie at the end)\n\nMe: (internal cringe) yep that's good\n\nMe and F: Staring at her like she is an idiot (totally unintentional I swear)\n\nC directed at F: Ok and for you?\n\nF: I would like a McIcecream with Oreo pieces please ( cashier surprisingly gets this right )\n\nC: Ok so 3 smoothies and 2 McIceCreams correct?\n\nMe and F in our heads: Wtf when did we ever say 3 or 2 of anything\n\nMe: no just one smoothie and one McIceCream\n\nC: oh ok so 1 smoothie, 1 McIceCream and 1coffee (no idea how she even remotely got coffee)\n\nF: Um we didn't order a coffee\n\nC: Really?\n\nF: Yea, we never ordered coffee\n\nC: Are you sure?\n\nMe and F together: Yes!\n\nC: oh ok (proceeds to stare at register for a good two minutes before walking and asking another employee something. She returns and starts pressing buttons)\n\nC: Sorry I forgot how to remove things from an order\n\nM: It's fine. You new or something?\n\nC: Nope! (Beaming with pride for some reason)\n\nMe: (internally imagining myself killing her 3 dozen ways but hey at least she is being polite) ok then. You got our order?\n\nC: yep (states order and Finally gets it correct) your change with be (insert change amount)\n\nMe and F go stand around and after about 15 minutes of nothing we head back up where we meet E\n\nF: Hello we ordered 15 minutes ago and we still haven't gotten what we ordered\n\nE: Oh that's a shame. (Proceeds to just stand there stare at us while doing nothing)\n\nMe: Um can you please get us what we ordered or check to see if our stuff is maybe made but hasn't been brought up\n\nE: (rolls eyes) fine (proceeds to start making what we ordered)\n\nE places what we ordered in from of us and everything looks fine until....... we notice that F's McIceCream is like 1/4 full.\n\nMe: (to E jokingly) Hey it looks like someone ate most of my friends McIceCream\n\nE: (looks at it) yep it sure does ( starts giggling and walks away)\n\nF: Excuse me but can you fill it up some more!\n\nE: I'm on break! (proceeds to the back NEVER to be seen again)\n\nMe and F walked out after that. Wished we complained to manager but we were already running late so we had to gtfo and back in the car. My friend did end up emailing corporate but we don't know what happened after that.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "This is about a particular chain of stores that has/is in the process of going bankrupt and deals with electronics and gadgets. Said chain went through a series of closures a year or two back (when this story occurred) and is now in the process of closing the remaining stores. \n\nBecause said chain is going out of business, My SO (male), my BFF (male), and I (female) went to score some deals. The store was being manned by two older male employees, both very tired looking and pissed and soon to be out of a job. Their filter has holes in it, and I understand. All of us work in customer service to some extent and like bantering with employees if we can.\n\nAfter some conversation, I pick out a 16 GB USB drive for 5 bucks, as does my SO. They have to be unlocked from behind a gate to prevent theft, so my SO asks for two. They are both taken up to the register and my SO proceeds to ring out, be being right behind him.\n\nThe cashier begins to ring up SO and proceeds to ring up both USBs, but we stop him saying that one of them is mine and I intend on paying for it. \n\n\"Whaddya mean?\" he says boisterously. \"He can pay for your USB. It's only five dollars! I don't believe in that feminism stuff. He can pay for it, right?\"\n\nThe store goes dead silent. \n\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\n\"Oh you know, I mean. Equal rights are great but...\"\n\n\"**Oh! okay good.** I thought I'd have to burn this place down before it had a chance to close.\"\n\nThe female customer behind me cackles. My friend is in hysterics. Employee looks embarrassed. We check out. I am still patting myself on the ass til this day for spitting that line out because that kind of quick thinking doesn't happen with me. \n\nEDIT: No, I don't normally threaten arson either. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯",
