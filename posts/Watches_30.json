My mother gave me this vintage watch for Christmas. I like it a lot in itself, however the watch is very heavily used. The bracelet and case are scratched enough that it doesn't bother me again, as they are relatively uniform. The watch glass, however, is quite scratched, so it is sometimes difficult to read the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor this reason, I am writing to you. I am looking for a watchmaker who can replace the watch glass for me. I have already been to 7-10 stores in Cologne - without success. Also online they could not help me so far. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you have any tips who can repair the glass of my watch? Preferably in Germany, otherwise the shipping costs will be too high.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you.",

Always disappoints me when it's a manual wind only. It's less convenient and I don't see any advantage \n-Water resistant That only means it will barely survive a few splashes. Seriously?! Not even 50m so that you can wash your hands stress free? At this price point i expect 100m as a minimum\n\n\nBut Grand Seiko really has to up their marketing game. They could :\n- Avoid bad associations with other brands (nissan gtr and godzilla were the 2 latest) that don't belong in luxury at all. The brand image thus suffers\n- Too many power reserve, especially with automatic calibre. It's ugly and useless (my opinion). Either an automatic watch is spinning when you put it on or it doesn't. It's quite binary 0 energy implies you have to wind it before wearing it. Or It's running and you just pust it on, it will wind itself No mater the power in reserve.  That Omiwatari has a power reserve on the back.\n- Way too many releases every year\n- No official model naming, only reference number. I would be better to have a few model lines with dial/calibre variants",

So, I guess I'm asking what you fine people would do in my case.\n\nI currently live in the greater Tampa Bay area but am not familiar with any watch makers in the area.

But they are not just simply three additions to Seiko’s collection of dive watches. With the Prospex SPB381, SPB383, and SPB385, Seiko introduces the first three mechanical GMT divers to the Prospex collection. \n\nThe SPB381 has a green dial, and the SPB383 has a black one. The third model is the SPB385, a special Save The Ocean limited edition with an ice-blue dial. Inside the 42mm case, Seiko equips all three of the watches with its new in-house Seiko caliber 6R54. The automatic GMT movement operates at 21,600vph and delivers 72 hours of power reserve. The movement lets you independently set the GMT hand of the watch in one-hour increments. \n\nThis means that it’s a caller GMT and not a flyer GMT. This would not be an issue, if the price were much lower. The regular SPB381 and SPB383 will be available in June 2023 for €1,700. The Save the Ocean limited edition SPB385 will see a production run of 4,000 pieces and will cost €1,900. While the idea of a GMT diver is very cool, we would like a flyer for that price. And murmurs online are already criticising Seiko for this decision/price point. \n\n[**Seiko’s second reveal of the day does much better - an interesting and colorful tribute to explorer Naomi Uemura**](https://timeandtidewatches.com/the-seiko-sla069-naomi-uemura-pays-homage-to-japans-most-famed-explorer/)\n\n/ Naomi Uemura was a tough guy. He climbed Everest multiple times, he was the first person to ascend Denali alone and the first person to reach the North Pole solo. He was also the first person to climb Denali in the winter, but he disappeared during his descent and his body was never found. \n\nSeiko has already created a limited edition to mark Uemura’s 80th birthday and are now coming back to mark his conquering of Mont Blanc in 1966 at age 25. It measures 44mm in diameter and 13mm thick, and it is water resistant to 200 meters. The case is has a standout blue stainless steel bezel with a dark blue bezel inlay. The crown at 4 o’clock is also executed in light blue, making this a rather colorful watch. The white dial uses special pressing and etching techniques to depict Mont Blanc. \n\nYes, it’s very expensive at €3,000. But… It’s powered by the caliber 8L35, based on the Grand Seiko caliber 9S55, it’s limited and numbered and a nice departure with it’s dial and colors from what’s out there. \n\n[**Seiko’s third big release is a quartet of beautiful artisanal dials**](https://watchesbysjx.com/2023/03/seiko-presage-craftsmanship-spb393-spb395-spb397-spb399.html)\n\n/ Popular for making artisanal dials affordable, Seiko’s Presage Craftsmanship series has been facelifted for the 110th anniversary of the brand’s first watch. The dials continue to be decorated with techniques ranging from fired enamel to Japanese lacquer, but the Presage case has been refined into an all-new design.\n\nThe restyled Presage is making its debut as a quartet of limited editions with dials in fired enamel (SPB393), traditional lacquer known as urushi (SPB395), Arita porcelain (SPB397), and translucent Shippo enamel (SPB399). They also updated the case, making it much more streamlined.\n\nPrices start at $1,450 for the enamel dial SPB393 and top out at $2,050 for the SPB399 with a Shippo enamel dial. Find a better deal for such beautiful dials, I dare you.\n\n[**Tired of Seiko? How about a Citizen diver?**](https://monochrome-watches.com/introducing-3-new-citizen-promaster-diver-automatic-fugu-inspired-watches-specs-price/)\n\n/ The new Citizen Promaster Diver Automatic Fugu come in a 44mm wide and 13.1mm tall stainless steel case, with one of the new references being black ion-plated. The serrated unidirectional bezel, inspired by the Fugu puffer fish, is fitted with a black or blue insert that has a 60-minute scale. The crown screws down to boost the 200m water-resistance.\n\nThe three new Citizen Promaster Diver Automatic watches come on different straps/bracelets and retail at different prices (although in close proximity to one another). The black and yellow NY0130-08E is fitted with a black polyurethane strap with a steel pin buckle and costs $550. Next up is the NY0136-52L, which is worn on a stainless steel bracelet with a folding clasp and is a bit pricier at $595. Topping the trio is the black ion-plated NY0137-09A, supplied with a blue polyurethane strap with a black pin buckle and a sticker price of $650.\n\n[**You may have forgotten about Shinola, but they still make watches**](https://www.ablogtowatch.com/shinola-debuts-the-canfield-model-c56-watch-inspired-by-the-general-motors-design-dome/)\n\n/ There was a day when Shinola was the hottest micro brand on the planet. Then they ran smack head first into a bunch of controversy and they kind of fell off the radar for a bunch of people. Now they have a new watch. \n\nThe Shinola Canfield Model C56 is inspired by the General Motors Design Dome building located in Warren, Michigan, the smooth upper part of its bezel is larger and has more of a pronounced curve to its overall profile. At the time of launch, the Shinola Canfield Model C56 will be available in two different colorways, although both versions offer an identical overall design and layout. One version is black with small white and orange accents, while the other features an alabaster white central dial with black text and a bright orange chapter ring. \n\nBoth models come in at $695, but considering they’re powered by the Argonite 715 high-accuracy quartz movement, which is essentially Shinola’s version of the popular Swiss Ronda 715, there might be better deals out there \n\n[**A lesser known Nivada comes out with a 70s integrated bracelet banger, making it a budget AP and better option than a Hublot**](https://monochrome-watches.com/introducing-nivada-f77-automatic-accessible-1970s-integrated-bracelet-watch-specs-price/)\n\n/ As with most of the previous releases of Nivada, the the F77 Automatic doesn’t come out of the blue. It is actually a revival of a vintage watch that was produced in 1977, with all the codes you would expect from a watch designed after the shockwave produced by the Royal Oak. The original model, which you can see below, certainly displayed references to existing watches – an octagonal bezel with screws – and was entirely in line with the codes of its era. Sharp case, facets all around, raised bezel, textured dial, integrated bracelet and all-steel construction. No question here; it’s one of the countless watches that followed in the wake of the RO.\n\nThe watch is powered by the Soprod P024 – a clone of the ETA 2824. Classic, precise enough and easy to service. It will be available for pre-order from the company’s website on April 7, 2023, for EUR 1,089, USD 1,150 or CHF 1,078, and not as a limited edition. It is definitely no AP, but could it be an alternative to an overpriced Hublot? Looking at the front of the watch, it could have better build quality than some Hublots.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# On hand - a selection of reviews\n\n[**Bamford teams up with legendary shirt maker Thomas Pink for a fun GMT**](https://escapementmagazine.com/articles/bamford-x-thomas-pink-gmt.html/)\n\n[**Cuervo y Sobrinos Vuelo Emilio Carranza Collection honour the memory of the legendary Mexican aviator**](https://monochrome-watches.com/introducing-2023-cuervo-y-sobrinos-vuelo-emilio-carranza-collection-pilot-watches-specs-price/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Watch Worthy - A look at an offbeat, less known watch you might actually like\n\n[**The Reservoir Kanister Watch, inspired by the dashboard of the Porsche 356, is back in steel on a steel bracelet**](https://monochrome-watches.com/introducing-new-editions-2023-steel-bracelet-reservoir-kanister-316-retrograde-minute-jumping-hour-watch-specs-price/)\n\nFrom the very beginning, Reservoir Watches has created a very strong identity for its watches.

I then kept it aside for a few weeks, and brought it out yesterday to wear again, but now I've noticed that the watch stops ticking really quickly. For example, I took a nap with the watch on my wrist, and when I woke up I noticed that the watch had stopped. This is my first automatic watch, so I'm not really sure what's happening, or how to diagnose the issue. Any help would be appreciated!",

Following days I ordered all the parts from different sellers and basically changed the whole thing. I have also used thick Panerai like tubes to make it more steampunkish/mad scientist vibe with uncovered lugs. It’s big, heavy, loud and totally in your face so I know it’s not for everyone but I really like it. Without any kind of name branding and with all the DIY mods it feels like my own personal watch. There’s a bond and it feels like my own child hence the name n00dlex Tubmariner you gotta name your kid haha. Anyone know what kind of watch is this case based on?",

But I'm so damn attracted to the blue Orient watches, they seem to be different than the blue dials on my other watches I just mentioned. Also, I have my eye on that vintage cream watch.\n\nI need you opinions on these three and which you would pick. Which do you think will catch the eye of others?",

        "text": "I will be graduating this spring and want to purchase my first luxury timepiece to commemorate this. I've tried all 3 on at various ADs and I'm happy with the fit and look. I hope to eventually acquire all three of these watches at some point which is why they are all so different. These are my thoughts at the moment, but I'd love to hear yours!\n\n1. Tudor Black Bay Fifty-Eight: This will be my only dive watch in the collection, and is the least expensive option of the 3 because I actually want to take this watch into the water and I would feel increasingly uncomfortable of doing that the more expensive my watch was. I really like the classic look of this watch and I've heard great things about it. \n2. Omega Speedmaster Moonwatch Professional Co-Axial Sapphire Sandwich: Another icon of the watch world, I was immediately hooked after trying it on at an AD and seeing how well the watch fit on my wrist. I think the history behind Omega and this watch is very appealing, and the co-axial escapement is just so cool to me. The chronograph is also my favorite complication, so that helps the argument for the Speedy as well!\n3. Grand Seiko SBGY007: This is my dress watch for the collection. The ice blue textured dial sets it apart enough so that I have room for a blue or white dial in the future. The power reserve indicator on the back is also a gamechanger for me as the dial feels much more symmetric. And the Spring Drive movement just blew my mind the first time I heard about it. All around, just a beautiful, elegant watch, but I'm maybe thinking of picking this one up later down the road when I actually visit Japan.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/96iw7oxq0gma1.jpg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f585214c6b8d0ede00baba3dbb96b405527994a7",

I love the slim case (diameter 42mm, thickness less than 14mm), functionality (day and date on top of a 12-hour chronograph counter), and style (classic panda dial). Availability is never an issue. But I also have some reservations. The movement is based on Sellita SW500, which does not seem to justif the official price of over $3,000 a piece.Sure I can get this on a grey market or buy pre-owned for about 30% off, but then comes the issue of service costs. Without warranty a service might cost a few hundred dollars, and I am not sure if it's worth it. And there is also the issue of resale price. Like I said in my previous post, I am not a huge sucker for resale value, but I also don't want the price of such a luxury and complex watch to decline too steeply. I've searched online and people seem to compalin that RW watches hold little to no resale value as not many people are on the pre-owned market for them.\n\nSo I wonder if the RW Freelancer is worth considering. Am I concerned too much about the cash value here? How is the durability of this Sellita movement? And how much reputation does the RW brand hold?\n\nMuch obliged!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yl5t12ovzfma1.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a2947766386678bdb1c304de95b4b194c509502c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/38rao4fwzfma1.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=36b4f1e2093d142940a18f953c665bf0e40c201e",
