Frankly I do not do much with analytics, rather the team learned I had a \"developer\" background (based on my degree) so I write scripting tools in Python all day every day. I've written some standalone applications for other teams that are Java 8 front-end with Python back-end (simply because the Java wrapped scripts I had already written).\n\n\nHowever, this is all just me, myself and I. I try to follow conventions I learned through school (build management, SDLC processes, etc...) but I have never truly been a part of a development team. I don't know what it is like to parse out work in sprints and have scrums, none of it.\n\n\nI don't want to get to a point where I've become very proficient in Python (maybe Java) but never truly been labeled a \"developer\" and if I try to go into development, new companies would label me as \"Junior\" since I am inexperienced with the processes rather than the languages or coding ability.",

Since then, I have touched a lot of things. I consider myself pretty good in golang and in python. I used these programming languages to do web servers, sorting algorithms, cryptography, fractals, machine learning, data analysis and more. As a 15-years-old, I was pretty proud of myself until I got the idea to build a graphical application.(I had previously learned basic html &amp; css and decided making frontend wasn't made for me) I first checked  for libraries in golang that would let me draw pretty windows. I stumbled upon electron, that thing that lets you build a desktop application basically as if it was a website. Cool. My first tought was: \"how can i make it interact with my golang applications ?\" Turns out it's a pocket browser that can only use... javascript.\n\"Ok, let's check some documentations and start learning javascript\", I tought.\nI found that javascript is super big. there are basically 5 different libraries to do the same thing. \nI need help. I want to dive into the world of web applications but I need a way in. I made a list of technologies I heard of that i would like someone to help me with:\n\njquery, \n\nangular.js, \n\nsocket.io and websockets(why are websockets not just like reglar tcp sockets ?), \n\najax, \n\nThe DOM, \n\nreact.js, \n\n\n\nif you have any informations regarding these things, please tell me. \nThanks a lot for reading me.

Got hired on full-time after an internship and haven't gone back to school since.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n2 years of software engineering experience - almost entirely working with legacy code in an ancient procedural language, along tiny bit of .NET experience just before I left this position.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n1 year of QA experience - paying the bills after moving across the country to Oregon. No coding. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMisc - Looking into designing an iOS application independently, have been working on a simple game in Unity using C#. Outside of coding, I'm sort of a jack of all trades with writing, art, music, athletics, which can help me fit in well at a lot of companies.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo, I have some of the raw skills, but I think I'll likely need to do a lot of refining.

When I ask what the style guide is (twice so far during conferences) team says \"there isn't one, that's what code reviews are for.\" On about 6 different occasions I was referred to excerpts from another company's style guide, but when I tried installing a linter that enforced the rules for it majority of codebase broke. \n\nTL;DR they were cherry picking random rules from a particular style guide to prolong a PR, while also claiming not to adhere to any style guide when asked twice. \n\nAlso, I should note when I checked out the link for the style guide they referred me to, it said the opposite of what their PR changes recommended.\n\nNoticed several DRY things to be refactored, &amp; bugs in our code that needed ironing out, and these were things I looked at on my own time and fixed after changes were merged. Also discovered / filed 2 serious (blocking from prod) issues in their codebase...\n\nEvery reviewer said it would be \"fine\" as long as their arbitrary style requests were met. No feedback on implementation or biz requirements.\n\nSometimes when implementing this many small, superificial changes at once it would actually break functionality and we'd have to hunt for bugs again.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that 0% of our feedback during review has been about functionality, logic, possible bugs, or design patterns. \n\nTo make things worse, during standup, reviewers from this company say they spent \"all day\" reviewing our code. Yup. And because of this, we sometimes spend an entire day humoring 100+ pedantic review requests that omit actual bugs or things that could be refactored or benefited by being looked at from another eye, especially given the fact that we're rushed &amp; satisfying requirements is key.\n\nAnd they would, apparently, spend \"all day\" making up post-hoc reasons not to approve (sometimes contradicting past reasoning) in lieu of a bonafide style guide.\n\nCurious: \n\nIs this is the norm in many other companies?\n\nHow others have dealt with this in a professional (like respectful but also constructive) way, without hurting anyone's feelings or causing drama or getting anyone in trouble. Don't want to screw anyone over or personally win over anyone- just want things to go smoothly and to be able to fulfill business objectives without unnecessary roadblocks.\n\nNote: before this, I have received near 0 feedback about style...as there was a common standard, also CI pipeline autoformatted it, and most reviewers were engineering types focused mainly on functionality rather than pedantry :). Rather than talky types who like to talk.\n\nEdit: just so we're clear: I don't have any hangups with people criticizing my code for what it does/fits in with the rest of the codebase. Last person from client who used to review was exceptionally talented principal engineer and I actually felt grateful when he would review because it was based on logic/very extensive experience and was a good learning experience for me...as well as benefiting the code. This arbitrary \"I'll just make up random rules unrelated to functionality on the spot and waste your entire day (and mine) before approving\" thing is another story, though.",

I'm 25 and didn't really want to delay me getting my Bachelor's even further.\n\nI've read a Graduate degree is not necessarily required for Software Engineers however when I look at LinkedIn, most have some sort of Computer Science Bachelor degree. Would it be beneficial to pursue a Master's or spend this time self-teaching the necessary programming languages?\n\nAgain, thanks for the advice!",

Since we've moved to one week sprints, I'm finding that I'm frequently having QA tickets kicked back to me over miscommunication and misunderstanding of the process in need of QA, or external issues (such as an application or server in our test environment needing to be restarted). When my entire team was in the same office it was generally something that a 30 second conversation would alleviate. Now I'm don't find out about these things until the next day, and once addressed, they aren't looked at again until I'm asleep. \n\nPermanently working their schedule adds an entirely different and more complex set of corporate and personal challenges that take this option off the table.\n\nI've began writing up QA process guidelines for more complex tasks so that they are aware of any new features that must be tested and their expected behaviors, as well as any potential issues they may run into as a result of our QA environment that aren't actual problems with development work.\n\nIn some cases it seems like there is a bit of a communication break down as well, which can lead to me signing on in the morning to find out that what was worked on was not actually relevant to the QA process at all. Today I found that a sample process I had started working on and scrapped for a better implementation, and made no mention of in my dev notes was tested. What a surprise that my scrapped code had runtime errors!\n\nHas anyone else experienced a similar issue when working on a global team? How have y'all dealt with it? Any suggestions?",

Fortunately, the wireframe skill helped me to survive the days after my internship was finished. \n\nI just recently have joined a company around 25 days ago. Where I was basically hired as a Python Django developer as I have previously hands-on experience on developing website with Django. To be noted, my first 3 months in this company are going to be probation period and I am told that I would be giving some sort of training. \n\nDuring the initial days, it was going fine and great. One of my senior colleagues who helped me a lot to understand docker, git in depth and some other stuff about the company. I was doing fine and could response in terms of need during first two weeks. That senior colleague had left the company on my second week in that company as he upgraded his career. Meanwhile, a new project has been initiated which was based on NUXTjs and for frontend vuetify has been used. I am completely new to these technologies. I was being told to do some task which I had to search for in google to resolve but I found less documentation or tutorial about vuetify which led me to not finishing the task. I am completely deadlocked with a lot of tasks where I never expected myself to be. I am new to this situation and now feeling guilty as I am not contributing enough. The CTO has already warned me saying \"Still nothing much has been delivered\". I am feeling like I am into a dead end for this job. And my guilty feeling is making me in taking the step in quieting my first dream job as a software engineer. I totally understand that the industry is moving forward. To adhere with this pace, I need some time and directions which I am not getting. \n\nI always believe progress comes with patience and times but it is not something corporate world deals with where it is being told \"move fast or go home\". I can push myself, I can 16 hours/day but I need instructions and some conversations on how can I improve myself. ",

        "text": "Hi,\n\nI have been reading a bit about AI in the past couple of days to understand the basic concepts to complete an assignment for Uni. The assignment requires us to implement AI algorithms to evaluate the league of a player in Starcraft II according to given input.\n\nThe data formatting is as follows: \n  \n  \n  \"GameID\",\"LeagueIndex\",\"Age\",\"HoursPerWeek\",\"TotalHours\",\"APM\",\"SelectByHotkeys\",\"AssignToHotkeys\",\"UniqueHotkeys\",\"MinimapAttacks\",\"MinimapRightClicks\",\"NumberOfPACs\",\"GapBetweenPACs\",\"ActionLatency\",\"ActionsInPAC\",\"TotalMapExplored\",\"WorkersMade\",\"UniqueUnitsMade\",\"ComplexUnitsMade\",\"ComplexAbilitiesUsed\"\n\n52,5,27,10,3000,143.718,0.0035151591,0.0002196974,7,0.0001098487,0.0003923169,0.0048490365,32.6677,40.8673,4.7508,28,0.0013966,6,0,0\n\nThe dataset contains approximately 3300 lines. I use 2/3 to train and the other 1/3 to test. \n\nI have decided to give a try with a neural network. I send all the values except the leagueIndex as inputs for the first layer (input layer) and the leagueIndex as the expected output to help it train. I have tweaked the configurations (number of hidden layers, number of neurons in hidden layers) and went from around 20% accuracy in identifying the league to close to 34%. It however seems to not learn any better than 34% even after a lot of iterations. \n\nCurrently, the data is normalized (between 0 and 1) with the following formula: \n    (X - min)/(max-min)\n\nHowever, I feel like the data might be the problem here (correct me if i'm wrong). When I take a closer look at the values, some of the extremums are really far from the average and I think this is causing the neural network to never converge to a better weight adjustment.  Example: \n    [0]: 3 (Min)\n    [1]: 1000000 (Max)\n    [2]: 975.562027707809 (Average)\n\nI was thinking maybe doing a Gaussian distribution for each input and removing X% on each side of the bell curve.\n\nSo, the questions are: \n* How could I adjust the data to increase the accuracy of the neural network in finding the league the player plays in?\n* Is there any other way I can tweak the neural network to achieve better accuracy (i.e: changing from sigmoid function to tanh)?\n* What other AI algorithm would/could be more suited for this kind of problem?\n* What books/websites/articles could help me understand what algorithm to use when.\n* What books/websites/articles could help me understand the process of optimizing an AI algorithm.\n\nTL;DR: Trying to explore dataset to find with game stats what player plays in which league for assignment. Need help understanding how to be successful.\n\nThanks for your attention. I’m looking forward to your replies. ",

I want to have a tool run on my home server that monitors my network for things like network usage on the server, the up/down speeds at different times throughout the day, and whatever other info I can manage. It will run these analytics at some set time interval, i.e. every 15 minutes. \n\nI'm thinking of maybe just having some kind of scheduled CRON job run that stores data in some kind of database, and a web-based GUI that actually displays insights from the database. The issue with this is the CRON job part. I'd like to be able to control when and how frequently the job runs through the GUI, so it may be better to have the application consistently run and internally handle when the analytics run based on user settings as opposed to letting the OS kick off the job via CRON scheduling?\n\nAs for tech stacks, I'm thinking of either using Python/Flask or NodeJS for the backend. I have no idea what I'd use for the database. I don't think there's much need for NoSQL here. Maybe just Postgres or MySQL. Idk. I'll probably use Angular for the web GUI.\n\nThoughts?",
