        "text": "In the past year I've gained a couple of friends who've expressed an interest in film to me, to the point where I gave them a list. They loved it, and seemed kind of surprised at all these great suggestions I had for them, having not heard of much. I put some 'risky' ones on there - films that if you've never seen anything like before, they might struggle with. However they didn't give those a try for months. Eventually I went over and we watched Mulholland Drive together, and my friends - they're smart people, they've just never watched anything like that before and it really threw them. It was a sad day... Last month we watched Dogtooth together (another film I love) and the energy in the room was so bad, it felt as if they had completely lost faith in my taste. I think the quote was, \"You're on Neptune, and we're still on Mars.\"\n\nSo now, I come to you... before I try more Lynch, or Haneke or who knows what - I think I need some gateway films to help them on their way. Surprisingly they enjoyed The Lobster. Maybe it was because I wasn't in the room for that one. I mean, how can you like The Lobster and not Dogtooth? Anyway... any help?",

        "text": "Now, I don't mean this in an elitist way, and maybe I'm off base here. I'm only now starting to get deeper into film, but the more I dig through my \"to watch\" list, the more I see myself thinking that older movies just seem to be more...honest, is the word? \n\nI don't really know how to explain it simply, and it isn't a matter of quality either since I'm not saying it makes them better than new movies. This isn't a hipster \"born in the wrong generation\" post by any means. With current movies I don't mean \"popular movies\" either, I've been watching a lot of more art house and indie movies and it checks out as well. Older movies would be...early 90s and back? It definitely starts being a thing after the late 90s.\n\nIt's just, it seems current movies seem to focus on aesthetic more, filling dialogue scenes with funny quips or introspective \"deep\" dialogue, having a soundtrack that stands out instead of something more subdued, and sometimes just not getting to the point? Vagueness and twists are more common, specific plot points take more time to resolve, a lot of tension gets lost.\n\nIn an older movie, if a character had something to say I can fully expect that character to just come out and say it, in whatever their own way may be. Characters would interact and stuff would happen. There's much less of a focus on the setting, on the scale, on side stuff. \n\nI feel like I'm not explaining myself properly and the post will get a bad reception regardless, so I guess I'll give an example:\n\nJohnny finds out his little brother got beat up.\n\nIn an older movie, Johnny goes and talks to a friends all angry, saying he's going to beat the crap out of the guy who beat up his brother, friends calm him down, Johnny seems to calm down but now apparently always carried a cup of whiskey around when we see him in night scenes inside, which friends try to slowly avoid. One day he gets arrested for murdering whoever beat up his little brother on a drunken rage, his friends are pissed because they thought he'd manage to forget that and blame themselves for not being able to stop his drinking problem.\n\nIn a newer movie, Johnny stops hanging with his friends and gives a pissed off reaction whenever they try to interact with him, while simultaneously drinking alone and brooding. Friends make funny quips about how he probably got dumped and that's why he was moody, it gets swept under the rug. A few scenes later, Johnny's seen getting arrested and it gets out that he killed someone, everyone talks about him like he's a terrible person; until a few scenes latee they find out he was drunk and killed the guy who beat up his little brother, after which they understand and forgive him for treating them like shit.\n\nI mean, in an older movie, if they want to put forward a plot point, they just do it. In a newer one, it seems to be a bit less linear. Am I alone in thinking this is a thing?",

        "text": "Amour is one of the most honest depictions of lasting love put to film. The relationship between Anne and Georges is as equally inspiring as it is heartbreaking. I can only hope I can have a relationship as tender and dedicated as they did. At the same time, however, having a relationship that strong die in such gut wrenching fashion would break me.\n\nMichael Haneke's use of long takes puts perfect emphasis on the emotional beats of the film. Anytime you're suppose to stew in the emotional potency of a scene, he refuses to cut and forces you to live in the moment without the reprieve of a cut. The lasting nature of many scenes adds to the brutal reality Haneke builds over the runtime of the film.\n\nThe inevitability of age and decay is obviously a personal topic for Haneke and the two leads which is why the storytelling and acting comes off so effortless. Emmanuelle Riva and Jean-Louis Trintignant undoubtedly show chemistry in the film but not in the typical romance movie way. Their chemistry is less explosive and romantic and more understated and caring.\n\nAmour is a tearjerker but that is simply a symptom of its subject matter rather than its purpose. The combination of Haneke's in the moment filmmaking and Emannuelle and Jean-Louis' honest performances make Amour one of the most emotionally challenging movies I've seen and a journey I both dread and am eager to embark on again in the future.\n\n***\n\nThis is my first post on this sub after being a lurker for several years so go easy. I really enjoyed writing this and hope it's appropriate for the sub.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/9hntcm/david_mamets_oleanna_1994_in_the_era_of_metoo/",
        "text": "I recently watched David Mamet's Oleanna (1994) after its recent Blu-ray release. I should preface this by saying that the only other works of David Mamet's that I'm really familiar with are the film adaptations of Glengarry Glen Ross &amp; Edmond, so some input about his body of work as it relates to this particular film would be most helpful! Especially considering the aforementioned two films were not directed by Mamet himself as this film was. I do see some rather interesting parallels with the Stuart Gordon-directed Edmond, but I'll leave that for another discussion.\n\nOleanna is really throwing my head for a loop in the wake of #MeToo (in a good way). You could springboard entire academic discussions of sexual harassment using this film alone. What's interesting is how much has changed since the film was released but is still *so* relevant. Like, for instance...\n\nThere's a line where the female student, Carol, mentions \"a verbal or physical caress [of his students]\" in a list of problematic behaviors. He claims they are devoid of any sexual content. Possibly true. I think we're led to believe that this is true by the way it's portrayed in the film. But he violated her physical space. He restrained her at one point, even. It wasn't violent per se, but clearly a violation that could be interpreted a number of ways by a student given the power dynamics at play. Though we've pretty much come to accept now that you don't violate people's physical space without consent &amp; you certainly don't caress people you aren't already intimate with e.g. lover(s) or significant other, family, close friends. Some very progressive-minded parents have even taken up the cause of consent for their children with their own family members, i.e. literally telling grandma that you need to ask before you aggressively come in for smooches &amp; hugs from the grandkids.\n\nJohn even suggests at one point that he'll change her grade to an A for the entire term if he agrees to meet with her privately as a way of provoking her interest &amp; desire to learn rather than getting hung up on the academics of paper-writing &amp; grading... because it's the learning that matters, right? Dare I say a generous offer, even? (Strictly indulging a hypothetical here.) Carol's attitude after hearing this doesn't seem to shift much. It seems to me that she was pretty uncomfortable that entire first scene where this is discussed. But she doesn't take *particular* offense at this suggestion nor does she suggest he's implying something \"more\" (her mood is rather statically awkward &amp; uncomfortable the whole time, no?), so we, the audience, have no way of knowing that she may have taken this as a sexual advance.\n\nIt may even be frustrating to hear it interpreted this way later in the film because \"she should have spoken up if she felt that way\" or \"why didn't she say something then?\" But that's how these things happen in real life. Women being in private situations like these with men who they don't *really* know but who have authority over them... there are a ton of reasons not to \"speak up\" in the moment. There is a credible fear of some sort of retaliation and it's bolstered by Carol's examination of John's seemingly patriarchal views about his family &amp; his role in the academic structure. But she doesn't \"seem\" scared, does she? What past experiences of Carol's might she have had to react a certain way? What might she have experienced in the past that would suggest to her that this professor offering her an A for the term to meet privately a few more times was a sexual advance? We don't know, but I sure as hell can't blame Carol for not wanting to push back at this suggestion in the moment. He's also very verbally aggressive, as is she but rather defensively. The audience likely assumes this is because he's incredibly passionate about trying to help this student understand something about him &amp; hopefully impart some knowledge. But did you happen to notice how many times he forcefully suggests she *\"SIT DOWN\"* at one point even raising his voice? In a later scene he does it again, but this time physically grabbing her &amp; putting her into a chair out of sheer frustration. For a woman, that has to be more than a few red flags when you're alone with a man you don't really know. With the right person, it is really *not* that hard to imagine this situation escalating to sexual assault (remember, she doesn't *really* know him). Again, who knows what sort of abusive situations Carol may have experienced in the past to cause her to take pause here? Did anyone also happen to pick up on the power dynamic in the first scene where it sort of seems like Carol is rolling with John's \"punches\" &amp; in some ways holding her own, but John seems to wield more rhetorical \"power\" in the conversation? It's subtle, but I think it's suggested in at least one obvious way. (See: John's usage of vocabulary that Carol is ignorant of; more on that later...)\n\nI imagine the lines were a little blurrier on the norms of what sort of unprovoked physical contact was \"acceptable\" in 1994. It's really meta as fuck to hear John talk about norms of communication &amp; language in that first scene while so much of the film hinges of his obliviousness to the implications of his words &amp; actions. In fact, I can't even imagine how much outrage men in the audience probably felt back then at hearing even the suggestion that some of the things he said &amp; did were totally inappropriate given their supposedly altruistic intent, but... let's be real, even as we're made to empathize with John, some *really* inappropriate things were said &amp; done. And damn does Carol give it back to John about his altruistic view of himself as a teacher. She thinks he's deluded himself into accepting a power dynamic &amp; hierarchical structure (while hypocritically claiming to loathe authority) because it benefits him &amp; his privilege and goddamn man... she is so **RIGHT**.\n\nI'm inclined to think this might have even been written as a pre-#MeToo \"slippery-slope\" warning about overly sensitive, easily offended college students that will \"take things the wrong way,\" but that might be exactly why it's a useful case study. I find Carol's sometimes shocking lack of vocabulary to be intentional as an indicator of her naiveté and/or ignorance. It's surprising to see this multiple times in the script given how articulate she is in later scenes. She even asks what \"transpire\" means at one point &amp; gets indignant because John didn't just use the word \"happen.\" She seems to be taking personal offense at John's usage of words that she doesn't understand because she sees it as a way for John to talk down to her. She accuses him of being \"elitist\" more than once; so she knows the word \"elitist\" but not \"transpire\"? Kinda weird the way that's written into the script, isn't it? It's a nuanced thing to examine because Carol isn't entirely unsympathetic, but I don't think it's going out on a limb to say that Mamet probably intends to portray John as the victim here. I could be wrong though. Carol lays out the entire problem of privilege, elitism &amp; sexism in academia *deftly* and, of course, Mamet wrote that part too. I think Mamet was probably *trying* at the time to be as fair to both characters as possible, but ended up making Carol look like more of the instigator &amp; John the victim when it's a bit more nuanced than that. What do you think?\n\nA fascinating and *frustrating* film to watch. Frustrating for all the right reasons, I think. We should continue to examine the issues &amp; themes at the core of this film closely because they're more relevant than ever.",

        "text": "[https://thefilmera.com/2018/09/16/jeremiah-johnson/](https://thefilmera.com/2018/09/16/jeremiah-johnson/)\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/6fee2obirin11.gif\n\n***“Ride due west as the sun sets; turn left at the Rocky Mountains…”***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith this simple advice, Jeremiah Johnson sets forth on a brutal course toward life anew. Robert Redford is the titular hero recently returned from the Mexican-American war in Sydney Pollack’s 1972 western. He abandons civilization for the mystic allure of the Rockies with plans to hunt “bear, beaver, and other critters worth cash money when skinned.” This journey completely reshapes Jeremiah, gradually molding the tale of his harrowing fate into a mythical, merciless, ice-cold mountain ghost story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn spite of his goal to escape the clatter of humanity, the mountain coaxes Jeremiah into a strange wilderness thick with people both living and dead. First he finds Hatchet Jack, a corpse frozen at the base of a tree with eyes locked deep in an empty gaze. Jeremiah pries Jack’s .50 caliber rifle from his frosted clasp and quickly happens upon Bear Claw, a wise cracking, wild-bearded mountain man played with subtle tenderness by Will Geer. He saves Jeremiah from starvation and eventually shares decades of his rugged hinterland wisdom. These scenes are executed with tremendous control by Redford and Geer. Their poignant synergy yields an unusual kinship while quietly revealing numerous scars of isolation. Bear Claw is a reflection of the man Jeremiah will become, a subtle warning of the harsh life ahead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlone once again, Jeremiah wanders into the mountain barrens, this time boasting a survivalist’s education. Hatchet Jack’s rifle and these newfound skills provide a stroke of good luck and allow him to thrive for a short while. Opportunities soon arise to trade furs with a Crow Indian called Paints His Shirt Red. Jeremiah even lets loose and tugs a few puffs from the peace pipe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile thankful of his rapport with the Crow, Jeremiah still hopes to conquer the wild riding solo. Unfortunately, the mountain has a different idea. He discovers the aftermath of a grisly massacre where two survivors remain: a young boy shocked mute and his hysterical mother. He helps bury their dead and sings along over the fresh graves as the woman howls a painful hymn. She then scuttles into the brush to die alone, leaving her son to live with Jeremiah. Not long after becoming a father, he finds himself married to a Flathead woman called Swan thanks in part to the careless savagery of a bald-headed scoundrel named Del Gue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThough initially bothered by their presence, he slowly fosters affection for Swan and his son, whom he calls Caleb. This blossoming affinity is paralleled with the physical act of constructing their family cabin in a powerful scene that ignores sluggish exposition in favor of rich montage and music. As they work together, palms raw from exhausting labor, a faint glimmer of hope dances between them. It appears Jeremiah has found peace in an unlikely place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***“Mountain’s got its own ways.”***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEarly in the film, when Bear Claw first says these words, they go without notice from Jeremiah. The dreadful truth emerges when he agrees to lead a tired company of soldiers into the bowels of the mountain to rescue starving settlers. They arrive at the outskirts of a Crow burial ground grimly decorated with old bones and tribal altars to honor the dead. He warns of the repercussion in desecrating such sacred land, but the soldiers remind him of their dire mission. Unable to ignore the poor souls in jeopardy, he guides them through and pays the ultimate price. A small band of Crow invade his home and butcher his family as punishment. The scene that follows provides one of the film’s most visceral, striking sequences. With the lifeless bodies of his loved ones entombed inside, Jeremiah sets the cabin ablaze like a makeshift funeral pyre. The flames curl and climb, slowly eating what remains of the life they forged. It’s in this tragic moment that the film takes a violent turn. No longer concerned with solitude or harmony, Jeremiah instead veers down a path toward sorrow and blood-soaked vengeance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJeremiah wastes no time in finding the Crow. He growls and stomps through their camp, fighting all five men at once like a ruthless demon. The tale of his revenge is told by the lone survivor, which rouses a seemingly endless barrage of retaliations sent by the jaded Crow. In another impressive use of montage, a storm of surprise-attacks synthesize in slick fashion, each with Jeremiah as the eventual victor. The story of his unforgiving resistance rattles the wilderness and all the people within, drawing the film further into mythological terrain. It doesn’t take long for word to spread of the lonely white man slowly dismantling the Crow. Enemies begin to fear him like a snarling beast from their nightmares. Some think he’s a ghost, others believe he’s immortal. Soon everyone knows the legend of Jeremiah Johnson.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis isn’t a Western crowded by shootouts or horse and buggy chases. Pollack’s film is a fascinating character study that relies on stellar acting and poetic images to spur the story. Redford boldly embodies the role and achieves a level of placid realism by saying more with his eyes than any dialogue could communicate. The magnificent frames of cinematographer Duke Callaghan invite the viewer to traipse through the snow and shiver with the hero in his struggle for survival. The editing is cautious, but full of meaningful intent. It implies a deep-rooted relativity between man and mountain, dissolving many shots of Redford into landscapes of the cruel environment, ingeniously emphasizing nature’s undying intervention in Jeremiah’s life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt times Pollack’s film aims toward an intellectual audience. It begins with an overture and pauses for a brief intermission somewhere in the 108-minute runtime. The sparse amount of dialogue demands the story be digested through patient, visual comprehension. Redford doesn’t rush his soft-spoken characterization, allowing himself ample time to develop his role through Jeremiah’s actions. Littered among these triumphant moments are aspects that pull the film in an opposite direction, away from its art-house sensibilities, hinting at somewhat of an identity crisis hidden under the skin. Banjo-accompanied scenes of slapstick with Bear Claw, Del Gue’s bumbling, cartoonish delivery—these scenes seem better fit for cowboy television from decades prior. Humor is steadfast in the western genre, but here it feels forced and is spread far too thin, leaving a hokey aftertaste as it fails to add balance to the strenuous narrative.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe music of Jeremiah Johnson is another element plagued by inconsistency. John Rubinstein’s score is beautiful and constantly engaging, but his instrumentals are book-ended by a cringe-inducing theme song. Tim McIntire’s vocals in “The Ballad of Jeremiah Johnson” are dull and meandering, summarizing the story before the film can even begin. What’s the point of half-heartedly telling the audience something the camera will soon reveal with great poise and eloquence? The singing oddly reappears once more out of the thin mountain air as McIntire muddles the excellent final words, “And some say…he’s still up there,” sounding winded like he sprinted to the studio to record at the last minute. The film was based upon a folk legend, and the song seems intent on enhancing the mythical vibes of the source material, but there isn’t enough time for the tune to resonate. This results in an awkward rather than uplifting song, leaving viewers like me to search for logical explanations to justify its inclusion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese weaknesses are somewhat inconsequential. Pollack’s film still shines unlike any other western. Jeremiah Johnson is not just simple entertainment, but a work of art that requires an open mind and undivided attention to pay it proper respect. It’s said to have a devoted cult following which comes as no surprise. A few years ago, I watched it with a friend and his father, an avid VHS collector and passionate fan of the film. From the first narration to the final credits, he mumbled nearly every word of dialogue crackling from the television. Though initially a bit off-putting, I later noticed scuffs on the tape from constantly feeding it to the VCR, and in this moment the film’s endearing impact became indisputable. This sentiment was reaffirmed with my most recent viewing. I again found Jeremiah Johnson to be a unique cinematic experience that almost entirely evades the weathering of time. I suggest seeing the film at least once, alone or with a group of close friends or family, if only to absorb the exquisite artistry that unravels on screen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "text": "I observe this sentiment across Reddit and other places, and not only on films, but mostly to it. When someone dislikes or say a movie like The Last Jedi, Interstellar, or Avatar, which are mostly well liked, they are criticicized for their opinions. However, when people exaggerate disliking over less popular movies, such as The Phantom Menace, Event Horizon, or any other \"bad\" movies with their fans, they are supported as being \"cool\" and \"funny\". I don't get it why is it ok to bash less popular movies, which are already punching bags to a lot of people, but criticizing well liked movies means someone is contrarian or wrong? Wouldn't that mean no movie can be objectively good or bad, as there will never be a consensus?\n\nWhat I'm thinking is - it's only \"cool\" to tear down a movie people circlejerk around against than something more mainstream people like it, either being the everyday blockbuster or the everyday art film.",

        "text": "I re-watched Mulholland Drive last night for maybe the 4th or 5th time since first seeing it about 15 years ago. \n\nWow. I've always loved this film, even before I'd begun to effectively wrap my head around connecting the pieces. It is above all else, a powerful film, and it captivates the senses in an almost ineffable way.\n\nIt's a film that I'd personally score as 10/10, but will likely reserve it in a category of favorite films that needn't be watched more than once every 4-5 years. This is a film that for me at least, needs breathing room between visits. I was deeply disturbed last night, even though I'm well familiar with all the jumps, freak outs, etc.\n\nWhich leads me to the one question I'm still puzzling over: Is the dead body we see (in a scene which takes place still during the main dream sequence) for sure supposed to be that of Diane Selwyn's? Or is it supposed to represent her actual condition; her failed hopes and aspirations, the death of her \"dream\" itself of becoming some icon of success in hollywood? Or perhaps she's even having a sort of premonition or sneak-peak of her own fate, which would make sense if she'd been already racked with guilt and contemplating suicide. \n\nThe body is of course positioned in the exact same way that Diane's body is in real life, upon waking up. The face of the dead body doesn't really look anything like Diane's, but then again it doesn't look like any face I've ever seen (fucking yikes), and since it's a part of her dream, it would make sense following the abstract dream state (where things are grossly or slightly misrepresented) that the face wouldn't exactly resemble her own.\n\nThe way the dead body scene was filmed, is also one of my only real gripes with this film. It simply felt like overkill, no pun intended. Showing the body for those initial few seconds would have seemed enough, but Lynch and his camera really make you sit in the dread, holding that shot for what feels like forever. They even cut away briefly to some other shots, only to cut BACK to the corpse again. \n\nAnyway, thoughts and opinions on this scene would be much appreciated. Thanks.",

Since most of you probably haven't seen it, I'll try to avoid spoiling any plot points here.\n\nIn the first 45-60 minutes of the film, I thought it was absolutely fantastic. In a terrifying way. I have never before had such a feeling in cinema. A feeling where everything is out of everyone's control and the whole situation is escalating at a pace you're absolutely not comfortable with. My heart was racing and I was sweating in my seat. This is cinema at its best.\n\nThen Gaspar Noé did what Gaspar Noé does, and took it one step further. One step too far. A specific event happened, and the film crossed the line to the silly territory. I immediately snapped out of my immersion to the unfolding chaos and couldn't get back in no matter how hard I tried. I couldn't take the film seriously anymore. For the rest of the film, I was watching the events from the outside, wanting to get back in.\n\nThis left me with a very mixed feeling about the film. The first half was brilliant, and I wanted the ride to continue until the end. And it would have if the immersion had lasted, because the second half kept the same style, energy and pace. But I couldn't play along anymore, which left me extremely frustrated.\n\nHas anybody else seen the film yet? I would love to hear what others felt while watching it. Or to those who haven't seen it yet, have you had similar experiences with other films? Is immersion necessary for you to enjoy a film or do you rather watch them from a distance?",

        "text": "[https://thefilmera.com/2018/09/19/johnny-guitar/](https://thefilmera.com/2018/09/19/johnny-guitar/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/nu0rvuu9n9n11.gif\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was first introduced to *Johnny Guitar* the way I assume a lot of people my age were: patrolling the Mojave Wasteland in Obsidian Entertainment’s modern roleplaying classic, *Fallout: New Vegas*. It’s one of my all-time favorite games, but considering its length (not to mention its replayability) and the fact that the soundtrack is fairly limited, you end up hearing the same songs over and over again. One of those is Peggy Lee’s “Johnny Guitar”, a song written specifically for the film. I can still vividly hear AI radio host Mr. New Vegas queuing up the song:\n\n\"*Got a song for you right now that’s about a man that’s cold on the exterior, but deep down you know he’s a good man, and his name is Johnny Guitar.\"*\n\nI don’t really have the vocabulary to accurately assess music, but suffice to say it’s a beautiful ballad, with Lee’s sultry vocals and Victor Young’s measured composition masterfully evoking a sense of long-lost love. It has a sparseness that feels perfectly suited to the barren frontier of the western genre, while retaining a pained romantic undercurrent reminiscent of a Douglas Sirk movie. Which is to say, the song is a microcosm of its namesake: a western dressed up as a melodrama, and a melodrama dressed up as a western.\n\nInitially derided by critics, except in France where François Truffaut lavished it with praise and referred to it as “the Beauty and the Beast of westerns”, *Johnny Guitar* is a complex film that has invited many readings and reassessments over the years, chock full of gender dynamics, McCarthy era politics, repressed sexuality, and a healthy dose of camp. Though it’s not exactly part of the revisionist western canon that would begin to form in the decade following its release, it features many of the same antithetical trappings. Its distinct style might prove off-putting to some, but for my money it’s one of the genre’s very best.\n\nThe plot begins with Johnny Guitar (Sterling Hayden) witnessing a stagecoach holdup on his way to an outskirts saloon run by the iron-fisted Vienna (Joan Crawford). Once there we are introduced to former city slicker The Dancin’ Kid (Scott Brady) and his gang: the standard tough guy Bart (Ernest Borgnine), the loyal and sickly Corey (Royal Dano), and the boyish Turkey (Ben Cooper). Then an angry mob barges in, led by the fiery Emma (Mercedes McCambridge), whose brother died in the holdup. She accuses The Kid and his gang of committing the crime and demands they hang alongside Vienna, whom she believes is in cahoots with them. Though there’s no proof, the townsfolk already hold a grudge against Vienna because her saloon is poised to make a great deal of money when an incoming railroad is built; town leader John McIvers (Ward Bond) compromises and gives them twenty-four hours to leave.\n\nWith so many people involved, it should come as no surprise that newcomer Johnny is sort of a periphery player—don’t let the title fool you, Johnny is by no means the protagonist. Played with laidback machismo, Hayden delivers the film’s rich, sometimes over-the-top dialogue with a palpable sense of coolness. It helps that he has a deep voice, and of course at 6’5” he towers above the rest of the cast, so even though he’s essentially just along for the ride, when he does speak his magnetism does wonders. He and Crawford are responsible for one my all-time favorite scenes, which I’ll get into later.\n\nIt’s no secret that westerns are typically a boy’s club. From noble cowboys to wicked outlaws, town drunks, shopkeepers, card dealers, what have you—women are almost always left out. And when they do show up, it’s either as a prostitute or as a standard wife/mother character who exists solely in service of her husband. There are certainly examples of more fleshed out characters who deviate from the norm (Katy Jurado in *High Noon* comes to mind), but even then they’re still sidelined and usually not integral to the main plot. That was never going to be the case with *Johnny Guitar* however, considering it was made as a starring-vehicle for Crawford from the jump (she held the rights to the book), but her real-life animosity for McCambridge led to rewrites that made Vienna even more prominent, including her demand that she have the climactic shootout, not Johnny.\n\nIn Crawford’s hands, Vienna is a domineering force, a former prostitute turned entrepreneur who backs down to no one. She wears pants and a six-shooter, which lends her a sense of masculinity, but a variety of colorful scarves and tops, including her iconic red-scarf/yellow-shirt combo, add a touch of femininity (remember this is the old west, where pretty much everyone wore shades of black and brown). She takes delight in her power, barking orders and flirting freely, but she isn’t a bad person. She possesses a great deal of loyalty and treats her employees well. All she wants to do is bide her time till the railroad comes. Her card dealer, Sam (Robert Osterloh), sums her up thusly: “Never seen a woman who was more of a man. She thinks like one, acts like one, and sometimes makes me feel like I’m not.”\n\nAnd in McCambridge’s hands, Emma becomes one of the best antagonists in a genre full of them. Her hatred for Vienna bleeds out of every word she says, as she grits her teeth, refutes logic at every step, and visibly shakes with murderous intent; no doubt her feud with Crawford aided her performance. I believe the shot of her running out of the saloon, after she’s callously set the place on fire (pictured above), is one of cinema’s finest moments. Vienna and The Dancin’ Kid have a shared romantic past, which Vienna claims is the true reason she doesn’t care for her (Emma seemingly has a crush on him, but won’t allow herself to admit it), but if you read between the lines, it’s clear Emma’s interests lie in Vienna, not The Kid. This adds a layer of tragedy to the role, a woman so hellbent on defying her attraction to the same sex that she won’t stop until everyone involved hangs.\n\nIn fact, same sex attraction is kind of rampant throughout the film, if not the whole genre. Obviously male bonding doesn’t automatically equate to homosexuality, but most westerns are about dudes shacking up together in some way or another, either on the road or in the thick of battle. When The Kid first sizes up Johnny, he places his hands on his belt buckle and looks him up and down like a piece of meat. And of course there’s the gun-as-phallus metaphor that everyone knows about. Elsewhere, a character says of Johnny: “That’s a lot of man you’re carrying in those boots, stranger! You know, there’s something about a tall man that makes people sit up and take notice.” I mean, if that quote doesn’t stand on its own, what does? No explanation needed.\n\nWhich leads to my next point—the script is phenomenal. There are so many good lines, really too many to list, but a few of my favorites:\n\n\"*Johnny: There’s nothin’ like a good smoke and a cuppa’ coffee. You know, some men got the craving for gold and silver. Others need lotsa’ land, with herds of cattle. And then there’s those that got the weakness for whiskey, and for women. When you boil it all down, what does a man really need? Just a smoke and a cup of coffee.\"*\n\n\"*Dancin’ Kid: I like you, Guitar Man. How’d you like to work for me?Johnny: I wouldn’t.Dancin’ Kid: Now all of a sudden I don’t like you.Johnny: Now that makes me real sad.\"*\n\n\"*Dancin’ Kid: How’d Turkey take it? Hard?Johnny: You ever know anyone to take a hangin’ easy?\"*\n\nAnyway, I could go on and on, but far and away my favorite bit of dialogue is the famous “Lie to me” scene featured above. This is the moment where the melodramatic nature of the film is fully actualized, with Hayden and Crawford’s words playfully bouncing off each other, while the music swells and heartstrings are pulled. It’s heightened acting at its finest, favoring a realm of romance over reality; in other words, it’s pure cinema. That it takes place in Vienna’s saloon, an entirely manufactured setting that doesn’t really make sense at all—the place is built against a mountain, with the back wall being made of red rock—only amplifies the otherworldly nature of the scene (and the film as a whole). Director Nicholas Ray wasn’t concerned with logic, he was concerned with *feeling*.\n\nAnd what feeling is best evoked by the film’s lynching scene? Fear. Hysteria. Disgust. Take your pick, they all apply. After being given the option to incriminate Vienna for something she didn’t do in exchange for his own life, Turkey fearfully pleads to her: “What should I do? I don’t want to die. What do I do?” “Save yourself,” she answers.  So Turkey gives in, offering the mob a version of reality that better serves their bloodlust. What does he get for it? A noose just the same, a fitting allegory for the era of Hollywood blacklisting and McCarthyism fearmongering.\n\nBy now, it should be clear that I absolutely adore this movie. The sumptuous Trucolor visuals allow the vibrant set and costume design to really pop—I promise you, the sky has never looked bluer—and a wealth of interesting characters, exquisite dialogue, an iconic theme, and a strangeness that feels wholly unique all combine to create a masterpiece of genre-bending filmmaking. In a way, I fell in love with the film before I even laid eyes on it, and I’m happy to say that 8 years later my love burns as bright as ever. Like a nourishing dish of comfort food, *Johnny Guitar* warms the soul and scratches my cineaste itch like few others. I could—and will—watch it till the end of time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "text": "To say that I was underwhelmed by The Lady Eve would be an understatement, oh no, I disliked it and found it to be very outdated in the worst kind of way. Its views on love, relationships and marriage are simply very dated and don’t hold up under any scrutiny imo. \n\nFirst of all, I have a hard time taking this movie as a romantic comedy because in my eyes there was nothing romantic about it, the whole situation is screwed and it's certainly not well written enough to convince me of otherwise. Especially the Henry Fonda’s role which is imo written way too much into the comedy side and ends up with his character acting as he would describe, a “half-wit”, and seeing how he somehow got fooled into thinking that Eve and Jean were two completely different people, can’t say that I don’t see him as somewhat of “half-wit” as well, instead of just the awkward character that he’s supposed to be. Not to mention how in certain parts of the movie, the movie tries to paint Jean as a victim of the situation and draws empathy towards her as if I was supposed to feel bad for her, but no matter how charming Barbara Stanwyck is(and trust me, she really is) and how funny certain scenes were(the ending certainly leaves an impact!), the movie got its heart in the wrong place. No, the only way it could have worked was if it was a critique or satirical take of old-fashioned relationships and marriages arrangement which’s flaws is perfectly displayed right here in this movie, and perhaps that’s is how some people interpret and see the movie as, but I personally don’t think that that was the intent of the director whatsoever and don’t see it as such. There’s a great movie in there, one that could have emerged if the writer cared to be socially aware of what he was writing but he was not(or maybe he was and this was just the norm back then) and the result is this movie which many people seem to love, but I certainly don’t like outside of Barbara Stanwyck’s irresistible charm or its genuinely funny moments. \n\nI was thinking about checking out “Sullivan’s travels” as well but seeing as to how much I disliked this one I’m not sure I will… Or maybe I’m taking it too seriously for a screwball comedy, but then again I thought “His girl Friday” and “Some like it hot” were both great examples of timeless screwball comedies and didn’t have any of the issues that I thought “The Lady Eve” had, so who knows? \n\n**What do you guys think?**",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n[As the festival finally draws to a close](https://thefilmera.com/2018/09/17/tiff-2018-dispatch-8-closing-night/), TIFF begins handing out its festival prizes. There’s no official competition like in Cannes or Venice; rather, since it’s the people’s festival, the people vote on all of the films playing. The People’s Choice Award has recently been positioned as a kingmaker in the fall movie season, with nine out of the ten previous winners nabbing Oscar noms for Best Picture, three of them—*Slumdog Millionaire*, *The King’s Speech*, and *12 Years a Slave*—winning. Every now and then you might still get a curveball, but we’ve come a long way since Toronto audiences were handing out the award to international arthouse favorites like Nicolas Roeg, Pedro Almodóvar and Takeshi Kitano.\n\nTIFF did, however, introduce a competition program four years ago, dubbed Platform, after the film by Jia Zhangke, who presided over the jury in the inaugural year. Platform is a section dedicated to bold, boundary-pushing visions from exciting filmmakers. I only saw one Platform film this year, [**Karyn Kusama’s** ***Destroyer***](https://thefilmera.com/2018/09/16/tiff-2018-dispatch-7-long-days-journey-into-cinema/). The winner was Ho Wi Ding’s *Cities of Last Things*, which had flown completely under my radar. TIFF has also recently added People’s Choice Awards for the best films in the Documentary and Midnight Madness sections, which went to *Free Solo* and *The Man Who Feels No Pain*, respectively. But all eyes, of course, remain on the top prize. The early favorite to win was *A Star is Born*, but Peter Farrelly’s ***Green Book*** pulled off an upset.\n\n \n\nThe winner always screens for free on closing night, and I was able to get a ticket so I decided to check it out. *Green Book* is based on a true story and stars Viggo Mortensen as Tony Lip and Mahershala Ali as Don Shirley. Out of work for two months while the Copacabana undergoes repairs, Tony takes a job as a driver for Don, a professional pianist, who is embarking on a music tour through the American South. Tony was recommended for his particular “talents” when it comes to handling trouble, but there’s a catch: Don is black, and Tony is racist. Oh no!\n\nYou know exactly where this movie is going without having to see it. *Green Book* is a road trip movie in which a black man and a white man get to know each other and make the world a better place, or at least make white people feel better about it. Yes, it’s based on a true story, and yes, it’s actually a warm and funny and endearing journey, and yes, Mortensen and Ali are great together and a joy to watch. But the film’s politics are the most disingenuous sort of liberal hogwash—that is to say, they’re clearly the politics of white Democratic voters, who would have voted for Obama for a third term. There’s a scene towards the end of the film, a pointed reversal of an earlier sequence involving our protagonists getting arrested and thrown in jail overnight, that functions dramatically as a #NotAllCops moment. *Green Book* is the kind of movie that’s full of dubious good intentions, existing for no other reason than to reinforce the status quo. It’s liberal, sure, but it’s also the opposite of progressive.\n\n \n\n[Burning](https://i.redd.it/mz0ar1fwk6n11.jpg)\n\nLee Chang-dong’s ***Burning*** was one of my most anticipated films of the year, but my reaction ended up being unexpectedly muted. It’s a good movie, formally assured and accomplished and as well-directed as anything Lee has made before, if not better. I overheard people calling it Lee’s best film as they were pouring out of the theatre, and its record-breaking 3.8 score on the Cannes jury grid would indicate such a consensus. But I found it clumsy in its scripting, with “clues” deployed in obvious and heavy-handed ways. It’s the kind of movie where a character is a writer and is writing a story, but what is his story, or what will it be, and how many times are characters going to repeat this dialogue? *Burning* is a mystery film, more loose and imprecise than Lee’s previous work. The cumulative impact didn’t cut me like *Secret Sunshine* or *Poetry*, for example, but at the same time, the more diffuse emotional reaction I got from this is something that will simply take more time to unpack.\n\n*Burning* is not the kind of film one wants to process on the 11th day of a massive film festival. I’m tired! And I’m curious to see what a second viewing will do, since a lot of my problems here, such as they are, amount to quibbles and nitpicks in the scripting. The film’s central mystery requires its characters to be ciphers, to a degree, and some of the characterization and plot setup just wasn’t working for me. That’s another of way of saying the film starts slow and takes a while to find its footing. But once Steven Yeun shows up, I was hooked. This is still a strong film; it builds and unfolds extremely well despite a daunting 150-minute runtime. Lee’s masterful direction is a big part of that, but Yeun is the true revelation of the film. I had seen him before in a couple small roles (I’ve never seen *The Walking Dead*, sorry), but he never left an impression on me. With *Burning*, Yeun gives one of the best performances I saw this year at TIFF. The film only works insofar as we can believe his character, Ben, capable of certain actions just as easily as not, and Yeun’s chilling and alluring performance hits every single note.\n\nThinking about Yeun’s performance, I started to think about the other performances I saw at the festival. Not a lot of them jump out at me, surprisingly. That might actually put Yeun on top, but there are a couple other worthy mentions here. Nicole Kidman is a towering inferno in *Destroyer*; I wish the movie around her was stronger, but I loved every second of what she was doing, goofy makeup and all. Anders Danielsen Lie is captivating and unsettling, but it’s a good performance deployed in an incredibly misguided way by Paul Greengrass—this being a reminder that *22 July* is the worst film I saw this year and you should skip it. As for good performances in good films, I have to give a shout-out to the entire cast of *High Life*. The opening segments with Robert Pattinson and his daughter were some of the most memorable moments of the festival, but I could say that about almost any scene in Denis’s astonishing sci-fi epic, from Juliette Binoche in her “fuckbox” to every single tender and beguiling moment with André Benjamin.\n\n \n\nThe last film I saw this year was Shinya Tsukamoto’s ***Zan***, or ***Killing***. It’s a period piece about a masterless samurai lodging with a small group of villagers. He is forced to prepare for war when another samurai, played by Tsukamoto himself, passes through looking to recruit soldiers on his way to Edo. The film is a continuation of the political, anti-war statements that have dominated Tsukamoto’s late career, at times even feeling like an addendum to his previous film, *Fires on the Plain*. *Killing* is cut from the same aesthetic cloth as *Fires*, a scrappy low-budget effort juxtaposing violent, existential horrors with shots of clouds rolling across the sky, captured with Tsukamoto’s relentlessly vibrating camera. It builds to a powerful conclusion, one final, anguished cry that echoes long into the night. But it’s also a shaky sketch of a film, feeling unusually underdeveloped for its 80-minute runtime. Tsukamoto typically excels with shorter work, but *Killing* ultimately feels slight and even unfinished.\n\n*Killing* functions best as a house built to support Chu Ishikawa’s final work. I only recently read about Ishikawa’s passing and was devastated by the news. Ishikawa was a legend in Japan’s industrial music scene and also produced film scores for nearly all of Tsukamoto’s films. I heard a lot of great music at TIFF this year, from Mowg’s brilliant score for *Burning* to the equally wonderful work by Hsu Chih-Yuan and Lim Giong for *Long Day’s Journey into Night*. I also have to give a shout-out here to *Legend of the Demon Cat*; Klaus Badelt’s score admittedly pales in comparison to his work on *The Promise*, but the film has a secret weapon in the form of RADWIMPS, who produced the theme song, “Mountain Top.” RADWIMPS previously composed the score for *Your Name*, and their theme for *Legend of the Demon Cat* might just be one of their best songs. But Chu Ishikawa’s score for *Killing* is where my mind keeps returning.\n\nI’ve been a Tsukamoto fan ever since a classmate introduced me to *Tetsuo, the Iron Man* back in high school. That means I’ve been an Ishikawa fan for just as long. Musical collaborations guide my cinematic tastes as much as anything. Imagine Federico Fellini without Nino Rota, Sergio Leone without Ennio Morricone, Satoshi Kon without Susumu Hirasawa, Hou Hsiao-hsien without Lim Giong (*Millennium Mambo* has one of the most iconic openings in all of cinema, and that doesn’t happen without Lim’s music). Tsukamoto and Ishikawa has been one of the most memorable and genre-defining collaborations, greatly influencing my sensibilities growing up, as a movie fan or otherwise.\n\nWalking out of the Scotiabank theatre after *Killing* had finished, I was filled with a sense of melancholy. That was the last time I was ever going to hear Ishikawa’s music. As I walked around the city, workers on cranes were already starting to tear down all of the TIFF posters on the sides of buildings, and the finality was overwhelming. My mind immediately went back to a scene in *Long Day’s Journey into Night*, when Luo hands Wan a watch, and she scolds him, saying you shouldn’t gift a watch because it’s a symbol of the eternal. In return, she hands him a small firework, or sparkler. But you shouldn’t gift someone a firework, Luo remarks, because it’s a symbol of the transitory. Wan replies, “Isn’t that what we are?”\n\nAnd so the festival is over. And I need some sleep.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n*The 43rd Toronto International Film Festival ran from September 6th to 16th, 2018.*\n\n[By Jayson Mcnulty.](https://thefilmera.com/2018/09/17/tiff-2018-dispatch-8-closing-night/)",

I would say his flaw is how limited he is in general but I think it's fair to say the same of most comedic actors.\n\nHeck, he honestly might be the modern day Buster Keaton and noone is receptive to it because we're all numbed from his ubiquity and how stupidly annoying most of his movies are. I think that thing of when someone makes something so predictable to the point of being automatic it stops being interesting to us. We zone out.\n\nWell...

I went to my showing of Mandy with a group of  normies that aren't as gore obsessed as I am but I was still surprised to come out of my showing and find that most everyone I came with had been unshakably bored.\n\n\"I liked the stuff at the end but they could have cut out the whole first half!\"\n\nI couldn't disagree more -- the first half is the bedrock of the movie. Every frame oozed with bottomless longing. Red and Mandy were completely enchanted by their time in Shadow Mountains but it was never without threat. All good things come to an end and the film-making seemed to bring us to that conclusions before Red ever could.\n\nRed stares deep into Mandy's eye in their cabin when we start to hear the Johan Johansson score swell with \"Mandy's Love Theme\". Despite it being a loving, tender moment -- the melody is full of sorrow . This music is in-itself a clue. This beautiful moment will soon become just a memory we have from our place in a nightmare hellscape.\n\nThe starling story and the hollow horns we hear in the background points towards a similar conclusion as well as the small deer in the forest absolved of all it's life and brightness. This monochrome kaleidoscope locked with the best score I've heard in years drenches us in deep mood. Unrelenting beauty &amp; melancholy. \n\nWhen the horrific act takes place we're in the middle act we're put in a perfect position to embrace the rage of the second half of Mandy.\n\nThese are just a few examples but I'd love to hear from you guys about whether the first half worked for you or not. \n\nMy friends and I go much deeper into this film and try to explain some things [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEEbuJwMjcQ&amp;t=1s) if anyone wants to check it out!",

Hoping to create this post to get some answers, while also spurring discussion at the same time.\n\nJust a little background, I am writing a paper for a Intro to Film class and the assignment calls for me to analyze a certain shot from \"The Philadelphia Story\" (1940). The shot that i have decided to analyze from the film has a lot of really interesting visual information, I should have plenty to talk about. There is one aspect that has me stumped. The shot as I can best describe is a \"Glamour Shot\" or \"Beauty Shot\". What I mean by this is that the actors are most likely lit from a back light making them glow and seem almost angelic. Also the camera lens used has a very shallow depth of focus making the two actors really pop on screen. I know for a fact I have seen this type of shot hundreds of times in countless other films from the classic Hollywood period. But for the life of me, I cannot find any information about the historical significance or how they set up these shots. I really have nowhere else to go but in the spirit of this sub that I love so much I will post three questions to spur discussion. If you have any type of source to back up your information that would also be helpful as well! Also I will attach  still images from other films from the period for examples!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. How was this \"Glamour Shot\" set up with lighting/camera lens?\n2. What is the historical significance. I.E. why the hell was this shot so popular during the classic Hollywood / Golden Age period?\n3. Why did the shot lose popularity. In modern films I find myself rarely ever seeing it set up?\n\nAgain thank you for reading and hope we can all learn something new about this type of shot!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/k7pxs9dmqxm11.png\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/mkimwzuwqxm11.png\n\nEdit: the actual shot in question.

I said in [**my review of** ***Let the Sunshine In***](https://thefilmera.com/2018/06/20/let-the-sunshine-in/) that it was a minor work; I was waiting, and hoping, for the long-gestating *High Life* to prove major, and it met those expectations and even surpassed them. *High Life* is Denis’s first foray into the science-fiction genre and also happens to be one of the most fearsome and challenging films of her entire career.\n\nRobert Pattinson stars as Monte, a convicted criminal aboard a spaceship heading to the farthest reaches of the solar system. The entire crew is comprised of convicted criminals, and the cast is impressive; it also includes, notably, Juliette Binoche, Mia Goth and André “Ice Cold” 3000. They have all accepted a deal to be part of a two-pronged mission into space, a set of experiments designed to research and understand the possibilities that exist for the human species beyond their home planet. The first part of the mission is to harness the power of a black hole. I’ll leave the details of the second part for you to discover yourself.\n\n \n\nThe film begins with Monte nurturing his infant daughter, and these scenes are warm, tender and understated. But Monte teaching his daughter the word “taboo” is a pretty obvious clue as to where this film is going. As Monte roams the halls of the ship, it becomes clear nobody else is onboard. In an early sequence, he drags some (unconscious? sleeping? dead?) people to an escape hatch and tosses them out. The world of *High Life* is so oppressive that nothing can be bothered to float in space; bodies simply plummet downwards, endlessly. If they ever end up in Hell, they should be so lucky.\n\nThe sci-fi setting of [High Life](https://thefilmera.com/2018/09/10/tiff-dispatch-3/) proves a necessary canvas for Denis, who is charting a course to the limits of human experience, diving into the deepest, darkest recesses of our souls. The film is full of binaries and explores the tensions between them: life and death, love and hate, nurture and murder, man and woman, etc. Denis wants to know what makes us tick, and pushes herself as hard and as far as she ever has, crafting a powerful film revolving around biological imperatives and the process of creation, a film obsessed with genes and cells and procreation and bodily fluids, the mechanisms and building blocks of life itself. Denis’s penchant for elliptical narratives is thoroughly uncompromising here, focusing on the most extreme and uncomfortable emotional moments in the lives of her characters.\n\n \n\nThe narrative structure is cruel and relentless. The opening passages of Monte and his child are frequently punctured by cuts to images of Earth and memories of Monte’s past. And as Monte wanders the empty corridors of the spaceship he calls home, the moments onboard that led him to this isolation slowly fill out the narrative with a growing sense of horror. As with the starship in *System Shock 2*, these corridors are haunted by prior traumas, and flashbacks occur like the ghostly apparitions of the Von Braun. Less a conventional narrative and more a psychological nightmare, *High Life* is a movie haunted by the sadness and horror and grief of human existence, struggling to make sense of our role in the universe.\n\n*High Life* finds its characters at their most vulnerable, weakest states, and returns to these moments over and over again. Denis finds in these moments a pathetic loneliness, and an even more pathetic, even wretched and ugly and helpless, drive to fulfill biological imperatives. Characters resort to rape and murder to survive. On his deathbed, one character spends his final moments begging for the woman who is about to perform a mercy killing to suck his dick. The focus on the most fundamental aspects of our biology results in a film grounded deeper in the experiences of the human body than anything Denis has made before. The film is obsessed with bodily fluids, from blood to semen, and at one point Binoche gets in something called a “fuckbox” and the camera travels all the way inside of her (yes, really).\n\n \n\nBut the film also contextualizes all these bodily fluids within the existential vastness of the universe itself. If we are all stardust, then our beginning, and necessarily our destiny, is literally out there among the stars. Denis subtly and deftly explores these connections through her minimal, calculated use of special effects and her editing and shot selection. *High Life* suggests cosmic births and transdimensional rebirths, and at one point features a shot that almost directly resembles one of the more bewildering and terrifying moments in the third season of *Twin Peaks*. So if you’re worried that Denis may not fully engage with sci-fi concepts, worry not. The film’s plotting is directly impacted by the realities of space, as the effects of radiation in outer space are fundamental to driving the story, and Denis depicts, at various points in the film, what it would look like to travel close to the speed of light, and even what it would be like to die by approaching the event horizon of a black hole and being stretched into infinity (yes, really).\n\nClaire Denis has always been a formidable, uncompromising artist. With *High Life*, she has delivered one of the most unapologetic experiences of her career. The film is often difficult and disturbing to watch. Denis, for her part, considers *High Life* to be a heartwarming story about a father and a daughter. It’s actually hard to argue with that. The film does not have a happy ending, per se—it’s as perplexing and ambiguous as you would expect—but it does end like it begins, in a way, with a gentleness that rarely exists anywhere in between, with human bonds forged and surviving through space and time. It’s hopeful in the way only Denis could be, working her way through pain and violence, and I daresay she has offered up one of the most singular science-fiction films in all of cinema.\n\nReview by Jayson Mcnulty.

So I was very excited when Criterion announced they'd be releasing an extended (note: *not* director's) cut of the film. Now after having watched it, I think 99% of the time I will be sticking with the original theatrical cut. It was interesting to see all of these little deleted shots, but I felt some of them, especially towards the end, really screwed up the pacing, especially in relation to the music. Also, most of this new material was pretty unsubstantial. For the most part it was a new shot added to an existing scene or something just fleshed out a tiny bit more. Multiply that by about 40 times and there's your extra 40 minutes of run time.\n\nInterested to hear others' thoughts.",

        "text": "This is copied and pasted from [my Letterboxd review](https://letterboxd.com/cbweaver/film/thoroughbreds-2017/) of Thoroughbreds (2017), written and directed by Cory Finley.\n\n--\n\n**Negative Space: The Movie.**\n\nWhere do I begin with this? It's a beautiful Coenesque black comedy neo-noir anchored by two incredible actors and filled with so much insight into the mind of an atypical late adolescent.\n\nAmanda (Olivia Cooke) believes herself to be a sociopath, feeling no emotions and faking her way through life. But throughout the film there are little hints--her compassion and remorse over her horse being prime among them, but also her love and sacrifice for her friend, and so many other, smaller details. She feels emotions. She doesn't understand how to express them. She sees it as mechanical, as something that happens, but has no way of understanding or expressing what she's feeling so hides behind her aloof facade. I'm sure a lot of late teens have felt that.\n\nLily (Anya Taylor-Joy) on the other hand plays at being the normal, well-advised, successful one, but to her everyone in her life--even Amanda--is a pawn. She feels no remorse, no guilt. She's what Amanda is pretending to be, though she is pretending to be something else. The dichotomy is beautiful.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if either or both of the leads goes on to win Best Actress one day. Especially Taylor-Joy--between this and her performance in The Witch, she has talents well beyond her 22 years. She is the next big thing.\n\nThe film itself is astounding in how bare it is. Like I titled this review, so much of it is what's left unsaid, what isn't shown. So much of it is in the silent pauses and static shots. The subtleties of the characters' expressions--which the recurring appearance of The Technique draws attention to--or the shots absent of any action tell more than any dialogue. It's masterfully written and directed, and for a first film from such a young director it's stunning. Cory Finley is another name to watch. I'll be keeping my eyes on his further projects.\n\nAnd while this film seems like a launchpad for these three young talents, it also marked the end of a career abruptly cut short. Anton Yelchin's final performance sees him play against type as a scruffy would-be drug kingpin on the sex offenders registry. He shows the diversity in roles he can play, and it only makes his untimely passing that much more heartbreaking.\n\nThoroughbreds is a stage play taken to screen, with all the appropriate beats and absences taken right along with it. A stellar debut for the writer/director and a great piece in the portfolio for the leads.\n\n8/10",

        "text": "I think Jean-Pierre Jeunet is one of the greatest filmmakers of our time, but sadly, he's pretty much unknown to American audiences, maybe with the exception of Amélie, which is widely loved, and Alien Resurrection, which, while has its own cult status and fanbases is mostly disliked by moviegoers.\n\nMy question is, why didn't he start an American career after the exposure he gained with Alien 4? I noticed Jeunet and Guillermo Del Toro share a weirdly similar beginning of career, doing originally movies on their homecountry (Delicatessen and City of Lost Children in France; Cronos in Mexico, and funnily enough, the latter two use Ron Perlman who can speak in French and Spanish). To add to the weird coincidences, they would both be called to make American horror films about oversized bugs - Jeunet with Alien Resurrection and Del Toro with Mimic in 1997. Likewise, their first American experience was hated by critics and wasn't a very good first experience.\n\nBut while Del Toro started making non-Mexican films, Jeunet continued to work on France, finding a huge success with Amélie, but surprisingly he never went full mainstream to Hollywood.\n\nI suspect that if that happened, he would start reusing some of his American Resurrection actors; I could see an American-based Amelie, maybe with Winona Ryder on the main role as she stared in Alien 4 with him - she kinda reminds me of Audrey Tautou with the big eyes and small hair (during the time).\n\nI guess he didn't like the lack of freedom with Alien 4? It's well documented Fox royally screwed and almost abruptly ended David Fincher's career with Alien³ and later did not let Jeunet have the freedom he would be able to do a really good movie for 4. It didn't help that his latest film was also incredibly badly released by Harvey Weinstein to screw with him because he wanted his own \"cut\" of the movie.\n\nWhat do you think? I think that in the end the fact he never became too big in the US for whatever reason is really sad, because he's an excellent filmmaker and director, who could do a lot of cool and new ideas with even higher budgets (and personally, pardon for breaking the end- I didn't like how The Shape of Water - a movie I enjoyed - seemed to appropriate many scenes from Jeunet's earlier works).",

        "text": "https://i.redd.it/cl3n7ecryom11.jpg\n\n**I**n **my previous dispatch**, I said the back half of the festival is often the best half. Perhaps that needs a little more elaboration. Yes, the excitement and hype is over, but for a local, the more relaxed atmosphere of the last few days has its appeal. Most of the guests are gone, press screenings have come to an end, and King Street is starting to look like its normal self again. The mania has dissipated, allowing a certain sense of purity to emerge on the second weekend. The festival is a lot more accessible; it’s easy to just run up the street and hit up a film after work. And it’s a great time to just hang out and watch movies, casually walking into screenings for some of the year’s biggest festival debuts.\n\nOver three-hundred films were invited to TIFF, and as we settle into the final weekend, these films are getting second or even third screenings. It’s a good time to cram in a few more movies, or catch up with the ones you couldn’t fit into your schedule earlier. And beyond the allure of the red carpet is an opportunity to catch up with films from, say, the Cannes Film Festival. One of the most discussed films this year was Bi Gan’s [Long Day’s Journey into Night](https://thefilmera.com/2018/09/16/tiff-2018-dispatch-7-long-days-journey-into-cinema/), which wowed audiences with its technical showmanship. I raced down to the Scotiabank theatre after work to squeeze in a screening, and I’m glad I did. This kind of movie is the reason big screens exist.\n\nI don’t know how much I can really say about the film right now. Festival fatigue started to catch up to me again (working all day didn’t help, I’m sure) and I was feeling fairly drowsy as the film started to roll. I didn’t fall asleep at any point—that I can remember—but I struggled for a while and found it difficult to focus. As it turns out, I may have stumbled upon the best way to watch the film. *Long Day’s Journey into Night* is literally about a dude who falls asleep in a movie theatre, resulting in an astonishing narrative bifurcation, the details of which I don’t want to spoil (but if you’ve already read about the film, you may have heard about its impressive technical feats).\n\nConfusion also seems to be a deliberate element of the films’s design, as the first half is highly fragmented and non-linear, operating more like a reverie than a rational detective story. The film’s second half stands in stark contrast, stylistically, and continually references or reconfigures the first, resulting in a hazy, shadow-soaked landscape of memories and filmic echoes. Every element of the production, from the gorgeous lighting (the film had three different cinematographers working on it) to the haunting music (provided by Hsu Chih-Yuan and Lim Giong), works together to mesmerizing effect. I have no idea what any of this is about. All I know for sure, at this moment, is that I can’t wait to see it again.\n\nI don’t know how much I can really say about the film right now.

All I know for sure, at this moment, is that I can’t wait to see it again.\n\nPremiering exactly one week ago here in Toronto, Yury Bykov’s ***The Factory*** is a tense and taut action thriller, suffused with ethical dilemmas and, dare I say, economic anxiety. Five years ago at this very festival, as I was looking for a couple extra films to slot into my closing weekend schedule, I was attracted by some critical buzz to a little-known Russian film, *The Major*. I had never heard of Bykov before, but after getting my ass kicked by that film’s bleak, unrelenting drama, I made sure to file his name away as one to watch. As I’ve said before, the glitz and glamour is appealing and exciting, but this is a festival for everyone, with hidden gems scattered throughout, waiting to be discovered. *The Major* was one such gem, ensuring I would turn up whenever Bykov returned to TIFF; five years was a long time to wait (his previous film, *The Fool*, did not screen here), but *The Factory* did not disappoint.\n\nThe film stars Denis Shvedov, who worked with Bykov before on *The Major*, playing Greyhair, a factory worker who springs into action when the owner decides to shut down operations and lay off the staff. He convinces a few of his co-workers to kidnap the factory owner, demanding a ransom with the pretext of unpaid wages. The film is a lean, mean and ruthless genre exercise, with one particularly intense action sequence that Bykov directs with exceptional skill. But it’s a grounded film, never losing sight of harsh realities and the thorny moral maze into which each character helplessly stumbles. I remember thinking *The Major*stumbled in its plotting towards the end, but *The Factory* builds confidently to an unsettling and clear-eyed conclusion, boasting one of the most simple and effective closing shots I’ve seen in a movie all year.\n\nUp next, my final dispatch for the year, in which I take a look at Lee Chang-dong’s *Burning* and Shinya Tsukamoto’s *Killing* and reflect on the festival as a whole.\n\n*The 43rd Toronto International Film Festival runs from September 6th to 16th, 2018.*",

Is this an exaggerate? For me, a movie has to be really awful for it to have an exaggerated dislike, and I mean it to hateful films such as the God's Not Dead movies.\n\nThe near worst a movie can be is boring, which I think most of these annual bad comedies or horror films are. The basic point is, though: do people really think a random movie is \"the worst ever done\"? Did they really walk out the theater, or is that just a purposefully constructed exxageration to make the product seem worse than it is or to gain social approval by hating on something?",

My friend argued that the ending was its weak point. To cheesy, heavy handed, ect, ect. I, on the other hand, loved it. I personally am tired of movies with the cop-out “it was all in her head” ending or the “its a massive allegory for depression” ending. Sometimes I just wanna see headless corpses worshipping the devil.\n\nI am definitely all for the return of the campy style. You dont need to be Ebert to see the similarities to Rosemary’s Baby, and popular culture is definitley shifting its tastes to a 60’s and 70’s style. That can clearly be seen with the influx of witch and occult movies. I think films from that era were just more fun and weren't trying too hard while still looking beautiful and being decently scary. Do yall think that the campy ending are fun and satisfying or dumb and not thought out?",

        "author": "arrow-s",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/9g1nc5/director_spotlight_finland/",
        "text": "Recently, a thread was started and deleted about the top directors of different countries. If nothing else, the thread showed a demand for showcasing the most accomplished directors in each country. That's why I decided to write an introduction to the top directors of my home country. Hopefully this will inspire others to do the same, because I would love to read about other countries too in the future.\n\n----------\n\n**Director spotlight: Finland**\n\nTraditionally, compared to the other Northern European countries, Finland has never been a powerhouse in internationally recognized cinema. In the mainstream, the most recognized Finnish director remains Renny Harlin (Cliffhanger, Die Hard 2 etc) which says a lot. Finland is a very small and isolated market, and therefore the film industry is very much dependent on public funding and subventions, leaving little room for artistic growth. However, despite this, Finland has been able to produce one international star director, Aki Kaurismäki. Unlike in Denmark for example, this hasn't unfortunately created a following of a next generation of directors. A few promising names introduced below will hopefully change this soon!\n\nI decided to focus on active directors, picking a few of the most interesting auteurs in my own subjective opinion. Some of the popular directors I decided to leave out include Aku Louhimies, Lauri Törhönen, Olli Saarela and Markku Pölönen.\n\n**Star directors**\n\n*Aki Kaurismäki*\n\nKaurismäki is a Berlinale darling with an occasional Cannes visit, including a Grand Prix for The Man without a Past (Mies vailla menneisyyttä, 2002). He has an immediately recognizable visual style: minimalist, austere set design stemming from the brutal landscapes of the post-war Finland. His sets are often intentionally anachronistic: for example in his latest film The Other Side of Hope (Toivon tuolla puolen, 2017), supposedly set in the European refugee crisis of 2015, we see government employees use dated office tools from the 1970s. His dialogue and humor are characteristically deadpan (even more so than that of Yorgos Lanthimos), delivered by his actors with minimal facial expression, often while smoking or drinking. Camera rarely if ever moves, and editing is conservative. Another important factor to Kaurismäki's style is the music, ranging from typical Finnish makeshift instrumental rock music (called \"rautalanka\") to tango. The main feelings visually conveyed by Kaurismäki are often melancholy and despair.\n\nDespite his toolbox looking sinister and depressing on the surface, Kaurismäki is always able to create films with exceptional humanism and hope. In fact, he is one of the most humanistic active directors I can think of. His subject matters are without exception focused on the people at the margins of our society: homelessness, poverty or more recently, refugees. Kaurismäki looks at their suffering with extraordinary altruism and empathy, showing conflicts being resolved by kindness rather than violence. His films are not interested in plot, but in the endurance of these people in constant distress.\n\nKaurismäki himself has listed R. W. Fassbinder and Luis Buñuel as his main influences. Especially the influence of Fassbinder can be seen in the simple and gloomy set designs. As an often-mentioned anecdote, Kaurismäki is still using a camera he once bought from Ingmar Bergman. In a recent interview he was quoted saying, in his typical deadpan style, \"Bergman used the camera in two films, I have now shot 18 of them with it. When can we start calling it my camera instead of his?\".\n\nKaurismäki recently announced his retirement from filmmaking, but I have hope of him being back behind the camera sooner or later. After all, it's his third retirement announcement already and he has always come back.\n\nFor newcomers, to get into his filmography I would recommend the following starting points: The Match Factory Girl (Tulitikkutehtaan tyttö, 1990), The Man without a Past (Mies vailla menneisyyttä, 2002), Le Havre (2011)\n\n**Established directors**\n\n*Klaus Härö*\n\nHärö is a well established director domestically, who is still waiting for his real international breakthrough. His films are often very emotional historical dramas, set against the backdrops of some of the most painful scars in the history of Finland, Sweden or Estonia. For example, his film The New Man (Den nya människan, 2007) tells the story of a young girl in the 1950s Sweden, where special needs children faced compulsory sterilization based on eugenic reasons. His most successful film is The Fencer (Miekkailija, 2015), set in Estonia under Soviet occupation, earning him a Golden Globe nomination for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nHis best films, in my opinion, are the tearjerkers Mother of Mine (Äideistä parhain, 2005) and Elina: As If I Wasn't There (Elina - Som om jag inte fanns, 2002). The former deals with the despair of a Finnish mother during the World War II, who has to send her son to Sweden to be raised by a substitute mother in safety, and the sense of abandonement of her son. The latter tells the story of a Finnish-speaking girl in the 1950s Sweden, facing discrimination after losing her father to tuberculosis.\n\nHärö's films are interesting and carry an emotional punch, but so far lack an ability to tell an universally compelling and timeless story. With Letters to Father Jacob (Postia pappi Jaakobille, 2009), Härö tackled a Bresson-esque project about a blind pastor and a pardoned convict, but didn't manage to find the theological or philosophical insight to raise the film to the international stage. So far his films, although good, have not been able to take the next step, but I think he has the potential to make it in the future.\n\n*Dome Karukoski*\n\nKarukoski is a more mainstream director with a good sense of pop culture and the current zeitgeist. He is currently close to an international breakthrough (currently filming a J.R.R. Tolkien biopic in England for Fox Searchlight), but it remains to be seen if he's able to make the cut. In Finland, however, he's a household name with several major hits under his belt. To me, he has been a hit-or-miss director with a couple of noteworthy films.\n\nHis best film, in my opinion, is his last. Tom of Finland (2017) tells the story of the titular artist. Growing up in an environment hostile to homosexuals, the film follows his life in a straightforward fashion towards becoming the iconic symbol of homoerotic fetish art and gay culture in the 1970s United States. Although the film has its shortcomings (hello, makeup department), Karukoski manages to tell a compelling story while creating fitting visual homage to the artist himself.\n\nOther noteworthy films of his include The Home of Dark Butterflies (Tummien perhosten koti, 2008), a powerful drama set in an abusive foster home for boys, and Lapland Odyssey (Napapiirin sankarit, 2010), a light-hearted and entertaining comedy about a man trying to please his girlfriend who wants a new digital converter box for her TV.\n\n**Rising directors**\n\n*Juho Kuosmanen*\n\nKuosmanen broke through in Cannes in 2016 with his second feature The Happiest Day in the Life of Olli Mäki (Hymyilevä mies, 2016). He went home with the Un Certain Regard award and later received high praise across the Atlantic from the likes of Barry Jenkins and Sean Baker. The brilliant, unconventional boxing comedy that is completely uninterested in the sport of boxing tells the true story of a Finnish featherweight boxer who is set to fight for the world title. Empire described it as by \"as if Aki Kaurismäki remade Raging Bull\" and I think this hits the nail on the head. The humanism and downplayed emotions reminded me of Kaurismäki while being something completely original. In addition, the crisp black-and-white photography is alone a reason to watch this film, reminding me of nouvelle vague films at their best. If Kuosmanen is able to keep it up, he will be the next Finnish star director.\n\n*Selma Vilhunen*\n\nVilhunen got famous in Finland after winning the Academy Award with her short film Do I Have to Take Care of Everything? (Pitääkö mun kaikki hoitaa?, 2012). I haven't seen any of her films yet, but I'm looking forward to the new film Stupid Young Heart (Hölmö nuori sydän, 2018) which just premiered at TIFF to [positive reviews](https://thefilmstage.com/reviews/tiff-review-stupid-young-heart-depicts-the-alt-right-resurgence-in-finland-with-a-story-of-unexpected-pregnancy/).",

[https://thefilmera.com/tag/filmframefriday/](https://thefilmera.com/tag/filmframefriday/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA Coen Brothers movie can be spotted a mile away. Look for noir elements, quirky characters, and human error; from such elements we get classics like *Fargo*, *The Big Lebowski*, and *Burn After Reading*. While these pieces play well together in a comedic tone, they can become dark and sinister with only a few small tweaks. There is no better example of this than the 2007 neo-western [No Country for Old Men](https://thefilmera.com/2018/09/14/film-frame-friday-no-country-for-old-men/).\n\nThe film is an adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's book of the same name. Both works are harrowing modernizations of the Western genre. There are no lone rangers or valiant victories. It's a world of poverty, psychopaths, death, and hopelessness. The law doesn't win. The good guy doesn't win. The bad guy doesn't really win either. And it all just happens on screen in objective, nihilistic fashion. I respect the Coen Brothers; they could've easily played all of this for laughs, but they were true to the book and its intention, and they built the film around that existentialist intent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeing nihilistic in nature, the Coen Brothers use voids and emptiness when constructing the cinematic experience of the film. This is particularly apparent in the sound design. The film has little to no score. Or dialogue. Or anything. There are portions of this film that are just long stretches of silence.  The only sounds heard are those that are diegetic and absolutely necessary to tell the story. It's a matter-of-fact approach that compliments this story of \"man versus inevitability\" quite well. In a traditional film, sound design suggests other parts of the world that aren't in frame. For example, if the scene is a commander walking across a military base, then you would not only hear the commander, but also basic training, practice ranges, rhythmic call and responses, aircraft landing or leaving, and much more to add to the size of the operation without the need of showing it. The only things you hear from off screen in *No Country* is either existential narration from Tommy Lee Jones or the incoming threat of Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem). The complete lack of sound in this film suggests a void that the main character Llewelyn (Josh Brolin) is wandering in. The startling silence is incredibly effective, giving those quiet moments an ominous presence while giving the louder shootouts so much greater impact.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe [cinematography](https://thefilmera.com/tag/filmframefriday/) plays with these voids just as much as the sound design does. Darkness is often used in the film to frame characters or vice verse with backgrounds silhouetting characters. Both techniques bring to mind the darkness motif again. Within the frames themselves, the use of emptiness is emphasized by a lack of periphery details. Every character who appears on screen has lines. There are no extras or CGI crowds, just a bunch of people directly or indirectly involved in Chigurh's hunt for Llewelyn. In nihilism and other fate-oriented philosophies, one main similarity is that, in the face of death, every one is the same, no matter their status or earthly wealth. The silhouettes and darkness have this effect. Everyone looks the same in the dark. The only person you can distinctly recognize in silhouette is Chigurh, which says something about him as a figurehead for chaos.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChigurh is an archetype found often in many post-modern stories that I will just dub \"The Comedian\". The basis of the Comedian character is that he realizes the reality of his existence, processes it, and continues living by \"laughing it off\" or accepting the chaos wholeheartedly. You can see this archetype in the *Dark Knight's* Joker, *Watchmen's* Comedian, or even Sisyphus in Camus' existential manifesto \"The Myth of Sisyphus\". With this archetype being the foundation, how Chigurh is designed and captured on film adds layers to the film's message\n\nFor one, his look is so distinctive. The world of *No Country* is full of jeans, boots, belt buckles, button ups, and leather. The men are all wearing their hair close to their head, and the women all have manicured nails, roughed up by being in the country, and hair that they take an awful lot of pride in. And then we have Chigurh. His dark palette goes against literally everyone else, an obvious example of how he is aesthetically different. His gait, his accent, his weapon of choice, his conversation... all make a prime example of a sore thumb. The haircut is just the icing on the cake. The strange length and cut of it are so un-American or fashionable and, as I mentioned before, make his presence strange but recognizable. It reminds me of Death in *The Seventh Seal*, and the relation between the two characters is obvious.\n\nGiven the film's theme of man versus inevitability, and Chigurh's role in that theme as the bringer of the ultimate inevitability, the Coen Brothers often frame him as such, focusing on his dark visage or—in the case of one shot—the symbol of finality at the end of a passage.  The editing also sees Chigurh's deeds as meaningless. Often times deaths will happen swiftly and with grotesque realism or, perhaps even more telling, not shown at all. Main characters die completely off screen. No pomp and circumstance, no swan song. Just dead. The realism is as matter-of-fact as the rest of the filmmaking.  It's not there to shock, it is there because that is what happens in the story. The Coens give the audience a completely grounded world. What is so disturbing about the film is how emotionally realistic it is. Whenever people die in the real world there is often no large set piece for a blaze of glory. The top billing dies like the day players. And towards the end, it rings true that even the worst among us can get hurt in this chaotic and messed up world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*No Country for Old Men* is an existentialist Western examining the anxieties of mortality. It is a benchmark in post-modern filmmaking. It draws on older genres and stories but captures them with such a bleak and hopeless perspective, the absurdist nature of the world can be nowhere else but in the forefront of the audience's mind.\n\nBy Jacob Watson.

        "text": "**Spoilers for both Eighth Grade and Searching**\n\nBoth films are about the relationship between a teenage girl and her father. The mother is absent, and the father and daughter have issues communicating with each other. The father makes an effort to connect with his daughter, but can be overbearing at times. The daughter expresses herself through a personal vlog, but doesn't have much of a following. And the daughter goes through a traumatic experience when a boy makes advances on her in a car (although this happens off screen in Searching).\n\nThere are plenty of other examples of two films being released around the same time about similar things. Armageddon/Deep Impact, The Illusionist/The Prestige, etc. But the interesting thing about this particular case is that each film is about one person's perspective in a relationship about two people struggling to communicate. It is also interesting how other examples of this phenomenon are very similar stylistically, but Eighth Grade and Searching are so different. Searching is a thriller told through the perspective of the father. Eighth Grade is a dramatic comedy told through the perspective of the daughter. \n\nWhat do you think this says about audiences in 2018?. The internet is prevalent in both films, but how do they relate?",

        "text": "There is only room for 1 black civil liberties film this year — at least this is what I find in my casual conversations with total normies that aren't compulsively rearranging their Letterboxd watchlist. Now that definitely doesn't speak for the Black audiences that films like BlacKKKlansman, Sorry to Bother You, and Blindspotting are likely to draw, but how will these movies stand come awards season ( and blog top-ten season)?\n\nAs a Latino, I can identify with having a culturally specific movie marketed towards me (Coco, Book of Life) and having the rest of the world see it as, \"Oh,. wasn't there already a Mexican animated movie this year?\" I'm not too stressed about it; we're institutionally represented well by people like Alfonso Cuaron and Alejandro González Iñárritu.\n\nThis year feels different. The movies coming out are all of great quality (admittedly, I haven't seen Superfly) and they all deserve the support they have received. \nCan we make room for more of these African-American lead/created films? Because they're coming. I won't list them for you, but I found this handy site that does [here](https://blackcinemaconnection.com/).\n\nActually, when listening to the \"Summer Recap 2018\" episode of Film Vault, one of the hosts says something to the effect of, \"Unfortunately, the way politics are, it (Blindspotting) is competing against BlacKKKlansman and Sorry to Bother You\" -- this is in regards to Oscar contenders.\n\nLet's make room for more of these movies and let's give the quality ones, like Blindspotting, the love they deserve. It shouldn't matter that Blindspotting wasn't Spike Lee directed or cast by the most popular Black actors. IMO, it was the better of these movies so if we have to name-drop Spike and actors like Tessa Thompson at the end of the year, let's leave a little room for creators like Daveed Diggs. This sort of expansion of the space matters and opens up opportunities for new and interesting ideas in film. More is more.\n\nThank you and if you'd like to hear my thoughts on Blindspotting specifically, you can find my humble YT channel [here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJ-v9CPosmg&amp;t=57s)\t.\n\n- edit because I was missing a whole paragraph.",

        "text": "Lots have been said, written, sung, played and put to film about the Samurai mythos. In all contemporary works regarding these mythical warriors there is a common word that keeps popping up: honour. Samurai are presented as honourable soldiers that hold this principle in the highest of esteems. Yet, much like every other act of representation of groups of people or phenomenae of centuries gone by, it comes with a good deal of a romantization. The 1962 film “Harakiri”, directed by Masaki Kobayashi, questions this ideal of the samurai’s code of honour, and the result is an unforgettable jidaigeki that very well deserves to be held among the greatest achievements in japanese film history.\n\nSet in the Edo period, the film tells the story of ronin Tsugumo Hanshiro (Tatsuya Nakadai), a lordless samurai who arrives at the estate of the li clan with the request of them letting him commit harakiri on their ground. At the time it was common for ronin to make such requests in order to receive gold from the clans or even a job to deter them from doing this. Suspecting that this might be the case, senior counselor Saito Kageyu (Rentaro Mikuni) tells him the story of another ronin that recently came to the li clan with the same request. Tsugumu, however, sticks to his resolve of commiting harakiri, claiming that he has “every intention of dying”. Little do the members of the li clan know, that Tsugumu has come with a hidden agenda of his own.\n\nhttps://breakingthefourthwallsite.wordpress.com/2018/09/14/harakiri-deromanticizing-samurai-honour/",

        "text": "Hello everyone! This is an excerpt from a review I wrote for my blog, if you'd like to read the long form DM me or something cos it's against the rules to link here, so here we go:\n\nFreaks was ahead of its time in undermining widely held prejudices, of people with disabilities, partially by giving you a more objective perspective on them that was previously unseen. Other than in the final sequence, their deformities aren't exaggerated or gawked at by the camera, they're viewed through the same lens as normal actors. In Freaks the circus performers undertake the same mundane activities and rites of passage: eating, lighting a cigarette, flirting, having children; only with unique quirks and adaptations befitting their condition.\n\nIn this way, weirdly, I saw some similarities with the Toy Story series.\n\nYa see, characters in Toy Story deal with their flaws, which are always related to shortcomings in ways they were 'manufactured'. Granted, in Toy Story, they can often use these things to their advantage, and you aren't horrified, or prejudiced against them because they're disabled, you don't gasp whenever Mr Potato Head *literally rearranges his face*. I suppose that's because physically, they're only abstractly human. But still, hear me out, we've got an isolated group of characters who are only used by their masters for pickup-and-drop entertainment, they've both constructed their own isolated, self-governing society where every member must protect the next from exploitation.\n\n'Stinky Pete' and 'Lotso' the bear from Toy Story 2 &amp; 3 both go through the same journey of heartbreak and embitterment as Hans in Freaks. Through experiencing rejection, they grow old in young skin, because from birth, they’ve wanted to be loved - which of course makes them easy prey.\n\nSid in the original Toy Story even assembles his own collection of 'freak' toys, who Woody later learns aren't significantly different from him, the two films even share significant aesthetic choices which I’m sure are deliberate. Compare these two clips and you'll see what I mean:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/gthEMHhS9zI?t=96\n\nhttps://youtu.be/kRhY9M7IamA?t=29\n\nWhat do you guys think, are there any other films that draw inspiration from Freaks or are there any other similarities I missed?\nShould disability be a part of the cinematic conversation in the same way race or sexuality have become?",

The way Panos Cosmatos used color in this movie was something I definitely can say I’ve never seen before (and if there are other examples of this style of filmmaking, please tell me because I need more) \n\nThe violence was sickeningly disturbing. I loved it. The gore was great. Johann Jóhannsson’s score was loud and scary and boosted the atmosphere of the film significantly. Nicolas Cage just left it all out on the table. People in my theater were laughing at his performance and it bothered me because I thought he did an amazing job and his performance fit the material perfectly. He was the unhinged, screaming madman the film needed him to be. I can’t think of anyone else who could’ve pulled it off like Cage did. \n\nSPOILERS  below if you haven’t seen Mandy yet but if not, I strongly recommend that you do. \n\nThe cult was disgusting and it was so satisfying, watching them get torn apart and mutilated by Cage in some extremely brutal and unexpected ways. Mandy’s death was hard to sit through, especially seeing how Red reacted to it. The disfigured and creepy bikers added another layer of surrealism to this movie when I couldn’t think it could get any weirder. I absolutely loved every minute of it. \n\nIf you guys have seen Mandy, what did you think? And for those who saw it, did my eyes deceive me or did the larger mutated biker who’s throat Red slit open have a knife for a dick. I couldn’t tell because of how quickly that scene moved. ",
