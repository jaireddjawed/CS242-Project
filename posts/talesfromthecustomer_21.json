        "text": "I bought a Crapsman garage door opener from Tears five months ago. After installing and plugging it in, there was a constant, faint, high-pitched whining noise. I didn't think much of it at the time and didn't want to go through the hassle of a return.\n\nLast week it stopped working. I checked the power outlet, wall button, and remote which were all fine, but the unit itself is completely dead. I suspect it's a bad capacitor.\n\nCalled the Crapsman customer care number on the manual. Even though Crapsman is now owned by BD Corp, they wouldn't accept any responsibility and said warranty service still had to go through Tears.\n\nCalled Tears which routed to an overseas call center for Tears Home Services. Explained to them my garage door opener broke after only 5 months. Was told it would cost $89 for a technician to come out plus additional labor costs to fix it since the warranty only covers labor for 90 days. The rep must've been working off commission since he seemed really keen and eager to schedule a home visit and extort me for more money.\n\nI told him I had no intention of paying Tears an additional $89+labor for a $140 opener. Asked him to send me a replacement capacitor under the 3 years parts warranty. They refused and insisted a technician had to come out to diagnose the issue. Asked if there was a service center I could take it to, again told no. Asked to speak to a supervisor but she just parroted the same things the first guy told me about the $89 home visit.\n\nSo unlike any other consumer electronic product covered by a warranty, there's no ability to send it in for repair or to take it to a service center. It will cost me more money to have the parts replaced under warranty than to buy a brand new opener.\n\nBasically, Tears has every incentive to engineer these things to fail after 90 days so they can collect additional revenue from you. I know they're almost bankrupt, but is it really worth the horrible customer experience just so they can squeeze out a few more bucks?\n\nI'll be attempting a chargeback with my credit card company and filing a complaint with the BBB. What else do you think I should do???\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: If you're buying a Crapsman garage door opener the warranty is only good for 90 days. After that, the 3 years parts/10 years motor warranty becomes less than worthless. They will charge you a minimum $100+ for a home visit. **If you have any hint the unit is defective you should call them immediately within 90 days or better yet, don't buy Crapsman!**",

He arranged for us to all sit on the patio, but insisted that our tables had to be separate. This was strange, as the patio was a private, enclosed area and we had it to ourselves. Anyhow, we ended up with three tables of four and played musical chairs to communicate with everyone.\n\nThe first meal came ahead of the others. My uncle decided to start on it, so his meat didn’t go cold. So, he took a bite and...\n\nThe waitress came swooping in out of nowhere! She told us that it was meant for another person and despite his protests that he’d eaten it, SHE TOOK IT TO THE OTHER TABLE.\n\nHe was laughing so hard, tears were rolling down his face. It was the most ridiculous thing and I feel so sorry for the people who got the meal after him.\n\nIt’s been two years or so and I still roll my eyes at how ludicrous is was.\n\nEdit: words.",

First, I notice no ushers waiting at the back (pretty standard at this theatre), I figured it was because there was just the 2 of us. \n\nThen we walk out into the kiosk area and it’s deserted with all lights off. As a joke, I say “I think we’ve been forgotten” because at this point I’m still just assuming that given the movie kept playing, everything else had been done ready to close, and there was just going to be someone waiting there to let us out or something. \n\nNope. Halfway down to the lobby and the alarm starts blaring outside. We hurry to the front door and they’re all locked. But we manage to get one unlocked and get out. \n\nWe wait around out the front and the alarm keeps going off for at least another ten minutes, and nobody shows up. Only after I call the security company from the window sticker do they send someone out and lock the place up and verify that we weren’t robbing the place. \n\nTl;dr: Walked out of our movie to find the theatre had closed, and set off the alarm.

Going up to the cashier desk I pass over the gift receipt and the item of clothing that still had tags on it. She scanned the items and indicated to us that the item had already been returned. \n\nAccording to the receipt it was purchase Jan 27. Their computers stated it was 'returned' Feb 2, which was ridiculous given I had the items in my possession through to the date I was at the store Feb 8. \n\nI was told the only way they could review the transaction was with the original receipt or the card # of the original purchaser- which i wasn't about to request either as that's pretty much the point of having a gift receipt.  The manager had zero interest in assisting me, offering an exchange for size or store credit. \n\nLuckily a little persistence with emailing the company resulted in a gift card for the value of the item (without needing to return the merchandise) which was generally appreciated as I was able to avoid further hassle with a new baby and healing from a c section.

Just as I was sitting down to get my haircut, an elderly man was getting his haircut finished and was preparing to pay. Now, this barbershop is tiny and hardly frequented (which is partially why I love it) and probably isn't that profitable, but the owner still offers 50% off to elderly customers. But here's where things get interesting...\nThe elderly man walked up to the register and took out a $20 bill to pay before taking his change and slowly making his way from the shop. After he left, the barber took the bill back out of the cash register and walked over to me. \"It's counterfeit,\" the barber said, before showing me how to distinguish the fake bill from a real one.\nNot only did he allow the payment from the elderly man knowing full well that it was worthless, but he graciously accepted it from him and then turned it into a lesson for me (I'm just a teenager) that could help me for the rest of my life, even though it was probably 10-15% of his daily profit.\nHe may be a barber, but today he's my hero. \nDoing the right thing, no matter how small, can change the world.",

She came to our table so many times in the ~hour we were there, each time with a comment on Fast and Furious, or similar movies. Neither BIL, SO or myself had actually seen F&amp;F, and none of us particularly cared about it, but she just kept talking about it.

She did mention that in that particular store they were encouraged to not take \"no\" for an answer, and not leave customers alone during the deciding process to \"maximize sales\"\n\nI am a very anxious person with a VERY short fuse when it comes to being harassed. I get very angry and very anxious very quickly. I tried my hardest to be nice through my whole time there but it got very trying. \n\nWhen I entered the store, I had a very nice conversation with the lady who greeted me, around 7-10 minutes long. I said goodbye and picked up several candles and put them in the provided bag. Almost immediately I was accosted by another employee, who tried to start a conversation with me. I was a little unnerved by this but played along. \n\nWhen that conversation was over, I tried avoiding the employees but it didn't work very well. Over the course of the 45-50 minutes I was in there, TEN employees talked to me, which is way too much stranger interaction for me to handle at once, honestly. I was also getting super pissed about constantly being torn out of my shopping zen to have a half assed one sided conversation with someone just trying to get me to buy something I probably don't want. \n\nI work retail. I know. I don't ever want to be the asshole customer but this was getting far out of hand and into what felt like borderline harassment. (Big stretch but I was stressed) \n\nI had been keeping track of how much everything was while I went with my phone calculator 8 body wash, 12 candles and 6 hand soaps. Around $313 worth of merchandise not including tax. I was going all. Out. \n\nBy the time the tenth employee came around to me to try to get me to buy some more I had enough. I looked at her and said \"I'm done. Ten of you have spoken to me, that's six too many. You can have all this back.\" And I gave her my huge bag of candles and soaps. She tried to apologize but I was just shaking and wanted to leave. \n\nI bought everything I needed with no hassle at High End Bath Bomb Store. \n\nI haven't been back into Body and Bath since, and I pass it every single day on my way to work. I don't know if I was overreacting but it just did not feel like a good time in there. \n\n\n*TL;DR: ten employees follow and try to talk to dude with anxiety in under 50 minutes, and make him not buy $300 worth of candles and soaps.*",

The owner came and chatted, even offering me a job there once I turned 21, but, spoiler I haven't been back due to life. Regardless things were going great...until our server came by.\n\nHe was visibly aggitated before we even ordered drinks. I remember my cousin was very annoyed by his attitude and I'm sure I didn't do anything since I was so quiet and shy back then. He gave us bare minimum service for no reason. (My husband and roommate have both been servers so I know how hard it can be, but as I said I don't recall us being a bother.) He even slammed my cousin's food in front of her and that was the last straw.\n\nMy cousin tore into him and she was not at all kind about it.

Apparantly he'd been an issue and this was the first time the owner caught him doing it. \n\nFor what it's worth though I hope he is doing better. We all have bad times, it's just unfortunate that we had to witness that.",

        "text": "A couple of weeks ago, I ordered a package of collectibles from overseas on Amazon. Last Thursday, the tracking number for the items let me know that they were at the post office, so off I went to get them.\n\nThere was no notice in my box (which has happened a fair number of times when I have a package) so I headed inside to ask the postal employees. I gave the lady at the counter the tracking number and told her Amazon said it was delivered yesterday.\n\nShe went into the back, and was there for a good ten minutes. Then she returned and gave me a random address in a state halfway across the country from me, and told me my package had been delivered there. \n\nThis seemed really odd to me, as my tracking number said it was at the post office waiting for me, and I've never had an Amazon tracking number be wrong. I asked her if she could double check, but she just informed me the package was in (Other State) and she couldn't do anything for me. \n\nDisappointed, I went out to my car, where my older brother asked me where my box was. When I told him what was up, he agreed that it was suspicious, and told me to come back in with him.\n\nWe went up to a different employee, and my brother showed him the page from my Amazon account with the tracking number. The employee checked it, went into the back, and came back out a few minutes later with my package.\n\nThe original lady that was helping gave me the dirtiest look as we were leaving, and I was pretty upset. I get that she must have mistyped the tracking number and got someone else's package, and I know that was an accident, but it's not my fault the second employee typed it correctly and found the package. And she could have double checked.\n\nBut now, every time I go in to pick up a package or buy stamps or whatever, if I'm next in line, she will stand there without taking any customers until someone else takes me, and then she starts calling them again. She'll be helping someone when I get in line, and all the way up until I'm next, but she won't take me.\n\nI never told the supervisor on her or filed a complaint or tried to get her in trouble or anything. I understand that she made a mistake and while I was upset she wouldn't double check, I wasn't going to get her in trouble for it! But this is really insane! Is she that mad that I proved her wrong that she never wants to help me again?!\n\nI picked up packages this Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, and each time she wouldn't take me when my turn in line came and took the person after me the moment someone else took me!\n\nIt's seriously the pettiest thing I've ever seen. And honestly, I find it so hilarious that she'd be so immature over it that I'm not even mad. Just befuddled and slightly annoyed. ",

        "text": "This happened last week. I was picking up some groceries and walked past two broadband salespeople next to their kiosk.\n\nI have no interest in changing provider, so I'm polite but firm when I give the young guy wearing a shiny, ill-fitting suit a small smile and say \"no thanks mate\" as he starts to make his pitch.\n\nBut he doesn't give up. First, he tries to guilt trip me in to talking to him by saying, \"So you don't have two minutes to talk to me? Not even going to waste your breath on me, is that it?\"\n\nAlthough this passive-aggressive retort was intended to be annoying, I just found it amusing. Keeping it friendly, I just said, \"Ha, right enough. No thanks mate.\"\n\nBut he doesn't give up. He's now doing the backwards jog in a desperate attempt to keep up with me. He tries another approach: \"Ah right, you're not over 18, is that it yeah?\"\n\nBear in mind that I'm in my mid-30s. A bit more peeved, I reply, \"Yeah that's right - I'm actually 12. No thanks mate.\"\n\nHe stops following me and says, \"Yeah, I wouldn't have said you look 12. You look more like... a dick.\"\n\nZero response from me. I just kept walking, same pace. About ten seconds later, in full view of the high street, he screams after me, \"I SAID YOU'RE A FUCKING DICK\".\n\nNow, you'll no doubt be wondering why I didn't respond, why I didn't complain to the company, and why I have no intention of doing so.\n\nThe thing is, I used to have a really bad temper. For years, I was extremely easy to antagonise, and would usually respond to a provocation like this with fists flying. On multiple occasions, I jeapordised my career, my relationship and my freedom due to an obsession with \"justice boners\", revenge, and teaching people lessons.\n\nBut a while ago, I decided to turn a new leaf. I have too much to lose now, and I've came so close to losing it. So I did nothing. And within ten minutes, all the rage I felt had just disappeared. Gone. At one time I'd have let loose on the guy and been fizzing about it for weeks, if not months. Now, four or five days later, I have no anger about it whatsoever.\n\nSo unfortunately there's no catharsis or comeuppance here. Just a dude finally beginning to conquer three decades of rage issues.\n\nMy new motto is this: Don't waste your life trying to teach every arsehole a lesson, just concentrate on not being one yourself.",

        "text": "I mentioned down in the comments of the first post I did in this...series? about how I had another story about sales snafus, and, well, that day has come. This is a couple of years in the past, and it is all SlightlyLessEvilCarrier.\n\nTo set the stage for THIS one: I had just finished paying off my current devices and figured I could swing for a FruityTablet because I've long missed my old Replicant 7, and wanted a device I could kick back and use instead of having to bring out the (very bulky at the time, because business grade) laptop.\n\nI had already cleared it with the girlfriend (the account owner), and we just so happened to be by a SLEC store, so we walked in to peruse their wares. After much work, it was decided that I'd pick up a FruityTablet, and the exchange up until a point went very, very well.\n\nThen came the time for the upsells. Specifically, SLEC's little upgrade plan where you hand them back your device and you can upgrade to whatever you want. Seeing as I was trying to keep costs down and I don't usually swap tablets often, I opted to skip.\n\nClearly, this was an affront to this rep's existence. For he kept trying to convince me. Over. And. Over.\n\nMy thing with sales is if you're trying to push something, you have a maximum of 3 times before I get pissed off and tell you as such. If I decline three times, let it go, you're not getting whatever it is you want out of me.\n\nThis guy was at try number 4 with me. He seemed to back off for the time being, but then another rep jumped in and started asking again why I was declining this revolutionary new upgrade plan! ...that I didn't need. Declined again. That's 5.\n\nThat's when one of the genius reps notices that hey, this isn't Kolbentine's account, and that the actual account holder is right there *and* she technically outranks an authorized user! \n\nThat's when both reps swarm her like flies on a freshly dropped deuce and begin trying to make her override my decision to decline the upgrade plan. She kept deferring back to me, but they continued insisting that I didn't know what I was doing and she needed to right this wrong. \n\nNow, my girlfriend is a sweet girl and she's super easy to work with in cases like this, but when it comes to things where we have joint authorization, I'm like the miniboss and she's the final boss. Sure, I put up a tough front, but they think if they make it through me that it's all easy street from there. \n\nNope, she verbally flipped a table in their face, and after the *seventh* try, they backed off and stayed backed off. FruityTablet in hand, we left, somewhat victorious.\n\nAs for why I didn't walk: I really don't know. Partially because it was the only SLEC store within walking distance and I didn't have a car at the time. So if I wanted something, I had to deal with that store.\n\nA bonus, though: Apparently that SLEC store is actually known to be garbage, because two years later when I went to grab another FruityTablet, I was at the second closest SLEC store, and they mentioned that the crap SLEC store was the only one with the one I wanted in stock. I dreaded it, because I wanted a new toy but I also didn't want to deal with *those* guys. \n\nI think the manager noticed the look on my face, because she came over, and offered to *drive to that store, pick up the FruityTablet, and bring it back to her store to sell to me.* Better yet? Zero upsells. At all.\n\n*That* is how you get a sale.\n\n**tl;dr:** Try to buy FruityTablet. Sales rep can't take no for an answer on the insurance/upgrade plan. Gets a stick lodged up his arse and tries to go after the actual account holder to get her to reverse my decision. Backfires spectacularly and some say that verbal table is still lodged firmly in his face. Fin.",

        "text": "Yesterday, we took our toddlers to a certain dimly-lit kid-friendly restaurant featuring animatronic zoo animals and fake thunderstorms.  The food isn't our favorite because it is overpriced and our particular location is pretty much consistently sub-par, but the kids love it.\n\nNeedless to say, we've been there quite a few times.  We know what the meals are supposed to include and what not. The kids get the same thing every single time because they are toddlers and apparently $8 mac-n-cheese from this place is heaven-sent compared to the $1 box from the store, or even any homemade stuff. It always comes with a side, a drink, a piece of toast, and an orange slice or two. \n\nYesterday, we ordered our kids' meals, then ours about ten minutes later.  Our adult meals came out about 5 minutes after we ordered them, but our kids still didn't have food.  Luckily, they are pretty patient and didn't mind the plates of food on the table that weren't theirs. Both of our plates had a lemon wedge on them. \n\nFinally, their food comes out.  The usual runny mac-n-cheese, grapes, a piece of bread, and what looked like 2 lemon wedges on each plate.  They were bright yellow and smaller in size than a typical orange.  They looked just like the ones on our plates.  Toddlers aren't that fond of just straight up eating lemon wedges, so when our server came back, I asked her about them.\n\nHer response: \"Those are oranges.\"\nMe: \"Yeah I know we are usually given orange wedges but these look like lemons.\"\nHer: \"No. That's what oranges look like.\"\nMe: \"...oranges are orange.\"\nHer: \"No, they aren't. That's what an orange looks like.\" (She pointed to the wedges.) If you read, you'll learn that oranges are yellow.\"\n\nMy husband and I couldn't tell if she was joking or not for a few seconds because she had such a condescending tone about correcting our clear stupidity about the color of oranges.  Then, she just walked away. \n\nWe tasted them.\n\nThey were lemons.\n\nWhen she finally came back around, we stopped her and said \"yeah these are lemons. Not oranges. Oranges are orange.\" (I threw in that last bit because I was thoroughly annoyed with how she responded to us the last time around.) \n\nHer response? \"No. Oranges are yellow. If you tried one, you would know.\" (again, pretty rude response.) \n\nMe: \"I did.\"\nMy husband: \"Can you bring us some orange lemons instead, then?\"\n\nAt this point, she was just as annoyed with us as we were with her. She walked away and someone else dropped off our check. We never saw her again.\n\nWe're still confused.",

I was forced to try his product, was asked very personal questions (like how often do you shower, do you wash your face etc.) I tried telling him I use black soap to wash my face and that it works fine. Then I told him that I need to check with my parents before buying the product, and he said that I don't need to listen to my parents. (Uh, excuse me I still live under my parents roof, pal. I have to listen to them, otherwise I would be kicked out and probably would be homeless.) \n\nThis whole thing scared me half to death. I was literally shaking.  I was so freaked out I couldn't even bring myself to eat at the food court afterwards like I had planned. (FYI I do have anxiety so you can probably imagine how much worse it made things)\nThankfully, my Lyft driver was very understanding and kinda helped me calm down.\n\nI did leave the mall manager a message on the phone, explaining the incident. I don't know if they'll do anything about but it was worth a shot. I'm still a bit shaky from it. I can barely look at the things I bought today without cringing. (I bought some pretty cool stuff too.) I'll get over it eventually. \n\nI also would like some advice on how to deal with these people in the future. I'm not planning on going to the mall alone ever again. At least I would feel a bit safer with someone with me. Especially if the situation got really bad like he physically grabbed me or something.

There was a display wooden full length mirror on sale, for a great price and it turns out it was also a jewelry cabinet. Friend wants it since we don't have a tall mirror at home and it's hard to coordinate outfits in the bathroom vanity.\n\nWe hadn't bought anything bigger than ourselves before, so we figure it would be good to ask. Also, Friend had badly broken his arm a few weeks before and was obviously in a cast. So we went down to the cashiers to ask for help.\n\nThe cashier and bagger looked at us like we were scum of the earth when we asked how to go about obtaining this mirror and asked some questions so they understood which furniture piece we were talking about. They let us know we could put it on a flatbed and roll it up for purchase. Great! We asked if we could get some help and they said \"What, can't you carry it?\" in the kind of tone that implied that we could and were maybe too entitled or lazy to do it.\n\nI gave them the biggest wtf face before I could stop myself. Friend has an arm in a full cast and I'm a small asian woman with noodly legs and even noodlier arms. I don't think either of us could lift a full length standing mirror that is also a box completely made of solid wood.\n\nThey then took note of the full cast and called a manager for a second opinion. The manager said the exact same thing and when we brought up the fact that neither of us were capable of moving the mirror to the flatbed, she reluctantly told us she would try to send someone over to help.\n\nSpoiler: no one was there. Friend fanagled the mirror to the flatbed and we struggled our way to the car where - lo and behold - someone was waiting! Hurray! Well... hurray-ish. He sort of helped us get it into the car, badly scraping the wooden edges in the process. But on the bright side, Friend got the mirror at a good price and it made it home just fine.\n\nTldr; guy with broken arm and small person wanted to buy a big furniture and no one wanted to help them move it.",

My then-boyfriend and I went to a local Convience store a while back to get some various snacks, drinks etc. We got there about 30 minutes till close and we were in and out in about 5 minutes. \n\nWe get home and I realize I can't find my phone anywhere. We search for a couple minutes and decide to head back to the  Convience store and see if my phone is there. We are both pretty sure I left it on the counter when I paid for our stuff. Thankfully we live super close so we get back to the store with about 5 minutes to spare until they close. The whole time he's driving I'm repeatedly calling them from his phone btw, and they don't answer once. \n\nWe get the door and all the employees are standing by the door waiting to lock it. (They still had 5 minutes until there official closing time but I get it cause I've worked retail too) I ask them something like \"hey we were just here and I'm pretty sure I left my phone on your counter while I was paying, can I run inside really quick to look? I'll be quick I promise!\". \n\nThe security guard that was with me looks at me deadpan and says \"no, were closed.\" (Even though it wasn't their official closing time) I try to remain polite so I could just get my damn phone back and say \"ok, can one of you just go look on the counter by the register for me? Please I just got this phone and can't afford to buy another one!\" \n\nThe security guard takes two tiny baby steps back, barely crossing over the doors threshold, turns his head to the side and says \"nope. Not on the counter.\" And proceeds to lock up and they all leave ignoring us. \n\nI call back the next morning and a very friendly elderly employee answers. I ask her if a phone was left on the counter. \"Oh yes! The alarm was going off on it this morning! I thought maybe one of the closers left their phone. Come on over and I'll hold it for you, my name is ____\" \n\nSo thanks lazy overweight security guard. Really going above and beyond on your customer service there!\n\nAnd a guinune thanks to the elderly cashier. This Convience store is not in the best neighborhood and if another more slimy employee found a brand new iPhone I might've been SOL!  ",

        "text": "So, to set the stage: I'm currently a customer of SLEC, or SlightlyLessEvilCarrier. I'm on my fiancee's account as authorized. Due to them kinda pretending to be good but not being as good as they used to, I'm on the fence about ditching them for EvilSatellite.\n\nTo help me out with that, my good friend made me a line on his EvilSatellite account and allowed me to get the new FruityPhone that released. I had wanted one anyway, and I had a choice: Either I could pay off my phone on SLEC and switch, or I could pay off the FruityPhone on EvilSatellite and stick with SLEC depending on where things go and if I liked EvilSatellite more.\n\nLong story short, EvilSatellite is marginally better for a significantly higher cost, therefore I opted to remain on SLEC. But I really liked EvilSatellite for some of their fringe coverage in the rural areas around me, so I thought maybe I could kinda go for a middle-of-the-road option and get a tablet line with EvilSatellite versus a phone line ($85/mo vs. $20/mo). Cheaper than tablet lines with SLEC, even.\n\nTalking it over with my friend, he was okay with this, but I most definitely had to have the FruityPhone paid off first. And that was fine, I don't like to write checks my ass can't cash.\n\nAnd in inquiring about getting a tablet...things started going awry.\n\nSeeing as I was nearby to an EvilSatellite store (and before anyone pipes up: Yes, it was a corporate store), I decided to pop in just to see what I'd be up against when this all goes down. See what the data plan entails, how much per month, if this can be done without the primary account holder present, etc. I made sure to state multiple times over that **I am not here to buy something today, I am merely checking to make sure the account is on the up and up for when I do want to do all this.**\n\nEverything was on the up and up, but walking in I noticed the tablet I was checking out wasn't on display anymore, so I asked if they still happened to sell them. The rep dealing with me disappeared to the back, and came back out...bearing the very tablet I was planning on getting once everything was paid. I was a little bit sketch at this point, but cautiously proceeded...\n\nUntil the rep pulled it out of the box and began trying to ring it up on my friend's account. Okay, not cool. \n\n\"Uh...I thought I said pretty clearly I wasn't making ANY purchases today.\"\n\nInstead of just backing down then and there, I got asked why. Why I didn't want to buy the thing now. When I told him that I had debts to pay before I could buy the tablet, namely paying off the FruityPhone, again with the why: \"Why not? The tablet is just $30/mo, you can afford to pay both.\"\n\nTo which I said that whether I can afford it or not is irrelevant; this is NOT my account, and the primary account holder told me that I need to pay off my previous stuff before getting new stuff. Them's the breaks.\n\nAnother rep joined in, saying something along the lines of \"you're sure he's going to mind just $30? Even if you're paying for it?\"\n\n**NOT. THE. POINT.**\n\nTo shut it down as best and as tactfully as I could, I told them that this is my friend's account, this is not my decision to make, and there is no way no how that I am buying this today, because I do not have his authorization, and you need to respect that.\n\nThat seemed to be the point at which they threw in the towel and gave up, because the rep dealing with me gave a sigh of defeat, took the tablet, and put it back on the shelf in the back, and told me I can always come back whenever I've settled my debts.\n\nYeah, not happening, bub. I was ready to give you guys money when this was all said and done, but in assuming I'd just...you know, screw over my friend and betray his trust in me to NOT mess things up on his account, you've lost your company a sale.

        "text": "Three years ago I was helping my then boyfriend with a project for his biology class.  His job was taking the pictures of the progress of the plant he and his group mates were growing.  Our first stop was a big name pharmacy with a digital photo lab.  \n\nMy ex thought it would be faster to download the photo lab app, but because he couldn't wait a minute, he marched out of the store.  I apologized to the employee who was helping us and followed him out the door.  It would probably help to mention that he was neither patient, nor the most polite person either.  In short, your typical \"I want to see your manager or give this to me free\" type, minus the hairstyle.  Oh, you know the [one](https://imgur.com/xldcHEg)!\n\nSo after talking him down, we arrived at another place which specializes in shipping and printing.  It seemed like this girl behind the counter was the only person working, but the place was empty.  My ex noticed the sign about printing and the girl behind the counter said that she could only print pictures from a flash drive.  She added, \"Editing is part of the price, so you'll be paying $10 for five pictures the way you want.\"\n\nMy ex handed her his flash drive, but what happened next was beyond unnecessary.\n\nThe employee showed him how she imported the photos into the editing program, then applied the filter to brighten the first picture.  She told us\n\n&gt; Unfortunately I can't adjust the brightness too much on this one or the picture won't look right.  Let me see how this will look with the contrast, but tell me how you'd like your pictures to look.\n\n&gt; Ex:  WHAT?? YOU SAID YOU COULD EDIT **ALL** OF THESE PICTURES AND NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU CAN'T ADJUST IT TO HOW I WANT IT?  ADMIT IT, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING!\n\nI looked at the girl behind the counter and apologized and I told my boyfriend:\n\n&gt; She just told us that she can only do so much brightening.  Just work with it; she's trying to help!\n\nNope, that wasn't good enough.  My ex demanded his flash drive and said, \"I'll just do this myself.\"\n\n&gt; You go do that, she replied.\n\nSo he storms out of Store #2 and I followed.  He had the nerve to say to me, \"If you were any slower, I would have left you behind.\"  I held in what I really wanted to say as we headed towards Store #3.  So we walk into this store's print and copy center and sit down at the computer.  Lo and behold, his flash drive isn't reading that he has any pictures!\n\nAdmittedly, I had to stifle laughter at how karma had played out beautifully.  He flipped out at me about how \"that bitch at the copy center deleted my pictures!\" and how he wanted to go back.\n\n&gt; Sure, let's drive by.  Maybe they'll let us in after they just closed.\n\nHe thought I was bluffing until he looked up the hours on his phone.  I chose to go home so he could deal with his project in shambles.  \n\nLesson learned:  Never insult the person handling your stuff.\n\n**TL;DR:  My ex had his pictures from a major project deleted by a photo tech after insulting her.  Oh well...**\n\n",

We spotted a certain fast food chain that specialized in fried chicken and fried shrimp. \n\nMy only worry was that it was getting kind of late as we pulled into the drive thru. Sure enough, I looked at their hours and they were 5 minutes from closing up shop. \n\nNow having spent many years doing food service in places with deep fryers I did not want to be THAT GUY who makes you have to clean the fryer twice and leave 15 minutes later than you want to. However, [I really wanted my chicken]\n(http://1.media.dorkly.cvcdn.com/38/58/2a0c68996ab3a9514d74d38cec4ce840-gif-of-the-day-the-hound-does-the-chicken-dance.gif). I knew what I had to do, I just had to have a little luck on my side.\n\nI rolled up to the speaker...\n\n&gt; Speaker: How can I help you today?\n\n Me: You got any chicken left?\n\n&gt; Speaker: What?\n\nMe: I see you are about to close. Is there any chicken left that is already cooked?\n\n&gt; Speaker: Oh, um... yeah we have some left. Maybe not enough of each for a full combo, but I can go check...\n\nMe: Well, I know you probably already cleaned the fryers, so you can just give me whatever - even if you have to mix and match. Just charge me whatever and we can call it good.\n\n&gt; Speaker: Uh... I will see what I can do. Please pull forward.\n\nI pull forward and the girl at window takes my card for a payment for their basic combo. She hands me a heavy bag. \n\n&gt; Girl: We never had anyone care about the fact that we were closing before. Have a good night!\n\nI am pretty sure I got everything they had left in the warmer. They filled the combo box to the brim. Probably 2-3x what they give you in their biggest combo. My roommate and I then feasted the rest of the night on media and delicious fried poultry. \n\nTL;DR My cell mate drops the soap and I fend off Big Bill with the shank I kept hidden in my asscrack.",

I was standing in line, waiting my turn to check out when a man appearing to be in his mid to late 50s comes stomping up to the register, cutting in front of everyone brandishing a half gallon of skim milk. We'll call him Milk Man (MM)\n\nMM to Cashier (C): Hey, I need to ask you about this milk!\n\nC: I'm sorry sir, I'm helping another customer right now. I can call \"Sarah\" from the back to assist you. \n\n-*C presses their headset thingy and begins to call \"Sarah\" to the front*- \nC: Sarah, can you please come to th-\n\nMM: \"SARAH, HEY! SARAH! SARAH COME UP HERE!\"\n\nAt this point everyone in the store is peering out behind every aisle or corner so see wtf is going on. \n\nS: -*Flusteredly speed walks to the front of the store to speak with the man.*- Yes sir, what can I help you with? \n\nMM: Is there any reason why all your milk has such close dates on it? Do you have any other ones?\n\nS: We haven't received another order of milk since earlier this week. What we have on the shelf is what we have. There will be another truck coming in a few days. \n\nMM: So what if I buy this, drink it and then the rest goes bad before the day it says on the jug?\n\nS: Well if it's bad and you haven't used any, you can bring it back and we will give you a full refund.\n\nMM: -*Scoffs angrily*- Well how is that supposed to help me?? \n\nS: -*Stares awkwardly at the ground for a few seconds*-\n\nC: -*Sensing the tension*- I'm sorry sir, if you want milk that has a later date on it, you'll have to come back when we get our next order.\n\nMM: -*Scoffs louder*- (almost like a toddler not getting their way. I half expected him to stomp his foot, throw the milk at the floor and cross his arms)\n\nMM: Well, I am *not* coming here again! This is *absolutely ridiculous*!\n\n-*He then proceeds to shove the milk towards \"S\" and stomp out the door, muttering under his breath*-\n\nEveryone else: ._.\n\nThe thing that confuses me the most is that this particular store isn't really as much of a *grocery* store as the other ones within walking distance. While this store *carries* milk, it's not something they necessarily specialize in. The milk wasn't even expired. If he wanted more time on his milk, he could have walked to the Sustenance Tiger up the street. It would've had a larger selection and possibly better prices as well (they carry off-brand milk, while this store only carries PAT milk). \nI have a hunch he just wanted to drink most of the milk, pour some lemon juice in what was left and take it back to get a refund. Why? Who knows, some people are just plain weird.\n\nTL;DR: Dude gets pissed because the milk he wanted only had several days on it before it expired. Shows his ass. ",

        "text": "So, here's the scene. \n\nI often go to a grocery store before work to pick up snacks for work. There is also a small coffee counter  at the front of the store where one can obtain caffeine. The coffee counter is part of a larger company, which has I'll call Cup Of Joe's. \n\n\nOn this morning, I decided to grab some coffee before heading to work. There usually isn't a line that early in the day, but I could see one has formed. No problem in my mind, since I had some extra time that day.\n\nI get into the line, it's moving quickly enough until the line hit the lady before me.\n\n&gt;Lady:\"I want a large mocha with nonfat vanilla and 4 pumps of caramel.\" \n\n\n&gt;Cashier: \"We are out of nonfat vanilla, will regular vanilla work?\"\n\nMocha lady's face morphs into some Visage of hell.\n\n\n&gt;Lady:\" You don't have any nonfat, I've been coming to Cup Of Joe's before you even born and I've NEVER been without nonfat vanilla. I need to speak with a manager, NOW!\"\n\nAt this point, the cashier and the other customers can see Mocha Lady seething in anger. The cashier just seemed stunned at the outburst. I kinda just wanted to punch Mocha Lady. \nLuckily, the manager was also working the coffee counter and quickly moved in.\n\n&gt;Manager: \"I'm sorry for not having nonfat vanilla, but as [Cashier] said, we only have regular vanilla at the moment.\"\n\n\n&gt;Lady: \"This is unacceptable, just unacceptable! You should have it always. How would Cup of Joe's work without nonfat vanilla!\"\n\n&gt;Manager: \"Again, I'm sorry, did you want a different drink? Or maybe substitute another flavor..\" \n\nLady cuts Manager off.\n\n&gt;Lady: \"YOU should ALWAYS have everything for your customers! We are the ones who pay your wages!  (insert long string of ranting here)\n\n\n&gt;Lady behind me: \" Hey Screamy, get your damn coffee and get some nonfat vanilla from the store if you need it that bad! Other people here need to get to work!\"\n\n(She really called Mocha Lady, Screamy)\n\nNow, Mocha Lady's eyes almost bulge out of her head. She opens her mouth to day something, but she just huffs scurries off out the door. At this point, the Cashier was just dumbfounded, but apologized for the wait. Of course, I wasn't mad since I had just witnessed some errant hellspawn try to order a sugary drink. \n\nAnyway, I got my coffee and the lady behind me got a free pastry for her troubles.\n\n",

I needed a charger cable, so figured I'd grab one while passing by.\n\nEntered the store and started browsing. Made my way around the store, ended up at the laptop and laptop cables section. Looked at them for a bit, then an employee, Danny (fake name), came up to me and asked what I was looking for. I told him I was looking for a charger cable for my phone. He replied with \"Well, our phone stuff are with our phones, just like our laptop stuff is with our laptops.\"\n\nAlrighty then.\n\nFollowed him to the phone cables, he asks what kind of phone I have - Android - and what brand - One Plus. He asks me what port, and I wasn't sure of the name, so I just showed him and he saw it was a micro usb. He asks if I just needed the cable, which I did, and picks out one. Briefly describes it, I let him know that I'll take it, and we proceed to the cash.\n\nOn the way there, he points out that they have the adapters as well. And \"they come in different colours too!\" This was actually the comment that I looked back on and realized that he was being an ass because I'm a girl, and we don't know nothing about that techie stuff.\n\n He proceeds to ring me out, asks if I want to get the warranty, and he explains what it covers. I let him know that I'll pass on the warranty, and he stops and looks at me and says in a condescending tone \"Did you understand what I just said?\"\n\nI let him know that yes, I do know what a warranty is, but I'm still not getting it. He proceeds to rant that \"you know what, that just means we get more money from you, so you're just going to be giving the store more money in the long run.\"\n\nAfter that, I headed home and e-mailed their support. Got a response about a week later saying they will talk to the manager and if necessary provide more training for their staff. \n\nReturned the cable though out of spite, and won't be shopping there again.\n\nTL;DR: Employee is an asshat\n\nEdit: Clarify that The Origin is a fake store name.",

We'd read no reviews or spoken to anyone who'd been so perhaps the entire thing was our fault.\n\nWe entered the restaurant, seating indoors and outdoors, it's a sunny day so we take a table offered on the balcony.\n\nWe look through the menu, my husband chooses what turns out to be quite a reasonable ham and cheese quiche. I order a different kind of quiche, one with spinach and ask the waitress if there is meat on the quiche. \n\nThe waitress is an original, she appears to be wearing bedroom slippers and under her apron is something that quite possibly could be a night dress but she's the only one out on the balcony and she has a name tag so we trust she is in fact a waitress who perhaps had a uniform disaster that morning? \n\nShe tells me the quiche I want does not contain meat, so I order it, letting her know I'm vegetarian and that whilst I eat dairy and eggs, I do not eat meat. She reassures me that there is definitely NO MEAT. Obviously I wouldn't be sharing this story with you gentle reader IF what she said was true.\n\nMy quiche eventually arrives, later than my husband's but he's still eating so I dig in and pull out small chunks of pink ham. I call the waitress over, I point out the meat. She takes away and shuffles off. Comes back to ask if I'd like to order something else. I'm quite hungry at this point so I ask for the sandwich selection and specifically ask that none of the sandwiches contain meat, chicken or tuna. I state as clearly as possible, once again, that I am a vegetarian and do not want sandwiches containing meat.\n\nThe sandwich plate comes out. Every single sandwich contained meat: ham, turkey, chicken, tuna and salmon. Not an egg salad or even a salad salad sandwich in sight.\n\nWe give up in disgust. Head to the front counter where we are met by the owner/manager who simply says \"sometimes we have one of those days\" and turns back into the kitchen and shuts the door. We were still young and stupid then so we settled the bill, happy to see the offending quiche was taken off but still moronically paying for the sandwiches. NEVER AGAIN.\n\ntl;dr No obvious vegetarian options on menu, made do, multiple wrong meals delivered, no apology  and we'll never go back.",

It was an older couple in their fifties. They asked for water with lemon, they got water with lemon. The woman was pissed that there was ice in the cup. Plus, there wasnt seeds in the lemon (what is this Spongebob?). Whatever, they get a water with no ice and with a lemon that has many seeds. At this restaurant, you get a salad. Their salads come over and the woman is upset, she is allergic to onions and theres onions in it. I understand her being upset, but you didnt tell anyone this, so it is her fault. She gets a new salad with no onions. I see her put an onion from her husband into the salad and complains. \n\n\"Theres still onions in this\" (Woman)\n\n\"Oh my god, Im sorry ma'am, Ill get you a new salad and it will be free\" (Waitress)\n\n\"Alright, thank you\" (Woman)\n\nThe waitress starts to turn around and then I speak up.\n\n \"Actually, that woman put onions from her husband's salad into hers\" \n\nThe restaurant checked the cameras and caught her, the whole time the woman is complaining about this being unfair and outrageous. She then picks up her dressing cup and throws it on the floor.

I also let the waitress know about that and I tip about 40% on my meal ($40, so i leave about $15)",

        "text": "My wife and I had a kid-free weekend and decided to try a new place in our town that has been open for about a year, but since it's not kid-friendly we haven't been. We decided to go Saturday night at 7 p.m. We are seated right away and notice that the place is just under half full when we get there. We are seated at an upstairs seating area. Our server promptly comes over, introduces himself and we just say that we would like water because we haven't decided on drinks yet. Wife and I talk and browse the menu. He comes back about 20 minutes later with our water (a little long IMO, but we're trying to have a good time). We give him our drink order and our appetizer order and dinner order at the same time and he specified that we'd get the app and then the dinner so we aren't eating them both at the same time. About 10 minutes later a different server brings us our drinks (an old fashioned and a glass of wine, nothing too complicated). \n\nAnother 10 minutes passes and we see our server going from the back down the stairs and outside (I guess he had tables outside and we were one of two tables he had upstairs?). About 10-15 minutes after that the manager brings us our app and we dig in. About 15-20 minutes later our server finally shows back up to ask how the app is and I say (a little snarky, I admit) that it was good since we finished it and no one came to check. He apologizes in kind of a snarky way and says our meal will be right up.  \n\nWe each ordered individual pizzas (she got a pesto/cheese pizza and I got a brussel sprout/bacon pizza) and we usually share. A different server brings out her pizza and me a big bowl of brussel sprouts. I politely tell the server that I ordered the brussel sprout pizza, not the side dish bowl of brussel sprouts. She apologizes and takes it back. I get not getting an order correct, so no biggie I can wait I'm an adult. Our server finally comes back, apologizes about the confusion and asks if we want more drinks. We both say, \"No thank you, we're good\". About 5 minutes later the manager brings up a glass of wine for my wife stating she ordered it. We inform him that we did not and he takes it away. At this point it has been about 15 minutes since my wife got her pizza and my order has been 'corrected'. I'm just getting frustrated and our server comes back and asks if we would like anything else. I tell him I would like the check, a box for my wife's pizza and I'd like my pizza packed up to go since we want to leave. He tells me no problem that my pizza should be up since they only take 8 minutes to cook. I then ask him why I've been waiting this long (about 20 minutes) for an 8 minute pizza to cook and he didn't have an answer. \n\nHe brings the bill and I put my CC in it to pay (not having my pizza yet) and I tell my wife I'm not going to pay until I get my pizza. Our server comes to our table (no pizza in hand or my wife's pizza boxed up) and grabs the check and my CC and says he'll be right back. I grab it back from his hands and tell him that I'm not paying until we have our food on the table because if we don't have it in 5 minutes we're just leaving. About 3 minutes later the manager comes over with both of our pizzas, apologizes and takes the app and my pizza off the bill. I thank him and he tells us this is a one-off night and he hopes we give them another chance. I informed him we would most likely not and let our friends know about our experience and thanked him for making our anniversary dinner a terrible night out, paid the bill (no tip) and got up to leave. I did stop downstairs to tip the bartender since he did make a good old fashioned and I didn't want his tips to suffer b/c of our shitty service. He thanked me and we went on with our night. ",

        "text": "Hiya, TFTC! LTL; FTP On mobile, excuse formatting, etc. \n\nI wasn’t lucky enough to see this one, but my dad was. So my dad went into a corporate pizza joint named after a certain Roman ruler. There was a couple there in front of him who had called ahead and placed their order. It’s important to note that there is a sign on the counter that says “If we don’t offer you a garlic bread combo, the garlic bread is on us.” \n\nM will be manager, G will be the guy’s girlfriend, B will be the girl’s boyfriend, W will be worker whom the girl called and placed the order with. \n\nG and B walk in just before my dad. So he walked in to them just as this whole ordeal was just starting. \n\nW: Oh, right! You ordered the pizza with half pepperoni, right? And you wanted it cut in squares. \nG: Yup! That was us. \nW: Cool. Lemme go to the back and get it. *Guy goes behind the counter and isn’t seen again. His manager comes out with the order.*\nM: Order for G.\nG: *steps up to take it and pay* \nM: That’ll be $6mil (or whatever the total was). \nG: *pays, opens the box to check her pizza* Oh this isn’t right. It’s all cheese. There should be pepperoni on half of this. \nM: It has your name on it. It’s yours. \nG: I understand that, but this isn’t what I wanted. \nM: Well you will have to wait!! 6 more minutes!  \nG: That’s fine. We can wait. \n\nThe manager sounded a bit frustrated, but the girl and her boyfriend were really cool about it. They weren’t expecting much from Tiny Roman Emperor. \n\nAt this point, the manager takes my dad’s order. About two minutes later, he comes out with the “corrected” order. \n\nM: G? Here you go. \nG: *opens the box again* Really? This still isn’t what I ordered. It’s just another cheese pizza. I want pepperoni on half of this. \nM: You will have to wait!! 10 minutes now!! \nG: Ok. That’s fine. We can wait. Just make sure you get it right. And cut it in squares. \n\nThe manager takes the pizza back AGAIN and comes out - about 3 minutes later - with another “corrected” pizza. \n\nG: Ok. Really? This is the third time. This is just another cheese pizza. \nM: It has your name on it! It is yours! \nG: Just because it has my name on it doesn’t mean it’s mine! \nM: What do you want? \nB: She told you three times now. A cheese pizza with half pepperoni cut into squares.\nM: I’ll give you round squares!! \nB: What is a round square? \nG: Forget it. We’ll just take this one. It’s not even worth it. \n\nThe guy and girl have both been really calm up until the point. The manager is the one who kept getting frustrated and getting an attitude with the customers. \n\nB: Well, he owes us free garlic bread. \nM: NO I DONT I DONT OWE YOU ANYTHING!! I WILL CALL THE COPS. \nB: No you owe us free bread. Your sign says here that you owe us free bread. You didn’t offer any of us here free bread, so you owe us all. It’s free. Give it to us. We want it. We want to talk to the manager. We want our bread. \nM: I AM THE MANAGER! I AM CALLING THE POLICE. I HAVE SECURITY CAMERAS. YOU ARE ALL ON CAMERA. \n\nThe manager then proceeds to pick up the phone and, without dialing a single number or pressing a single button, says “Hello, Police?!” \n\nMy dad just burst out laughing at this point. The guy just told the manager to forget it. He slammed the pizza down on the counter and demanded his money back. The manager, satisfied that he had “won”, gave them a full refund. They walked out without anything. \n\nTL;DR Couple asks for what must seem to the manager like a complicated order, gets it wrong 3 times, and tries to call the police for no real reason. ",

Ordered delivery, as you do.\n\nAmongst the small commotion of discussing birthday parties and trying to calm down our cats - my brother's aunt dropped him off, and she brought nail clippers for the cats and picked them up against their will and tried to cut their nails without even asking if that was okay... at this moment they were both hiding and one was crying, so I was already stressed - between all this, our delivery driver shows up. I start getting relieved, as my aunt took this as a cue to leave. \n\nAs he hands me the pizza, I hand him the money, and I can see where the confusion may have been... I mentioned I was giving him \"almost exact change, and take a $5 tip for yourself.\" \n\nHe was like \"Okay, thanks!\" With a smile and he walks off to the car, I assume to get change. I turn to listen to the small talk my aunt gives my dad as she leaves, when all of a sudden, I hear a car start. I turn around, wondering what's going on, and through the trees on our patio, I see the light of the pizza delivery car pulling out of the parking spot. What the hell, man? Our order was $27.36. Add $5 onto that and it's $32.36. I gave him the coins so he could give the dollars back. $8 doesn't sound like much, but I can't get a job because of my anxiety at the moment, so I can't spare any.\n\nI went back inside and called the store and told them that he took our change, and to lower his tip to $4. I'm debating calling back and telling them to lower the tip to nothing, even. Even if somebody says \"exact change\", before you drive off, you should at least count to make sure you have the right amount.\n\nEdit: I guess next time somebody drives off with money that's not theirs, I should just let them do that and keep my mouth shut because apparently they deserve my money more than I do.

We then waited another ten minutes to receive two waters. \n\nMore time goes by. Still no sign of our server anywhere even though employees were constantly walking by our table and said they'll \"find out\" who our server is for us so we can order. We were about to give up when a young woman casually comes over to our table to ask us what we'd like. So we decide to give her the benefit of the doubt and order our food. \n\nEven more time passes, but we finally see her walking towards our table with two plates of food...that we didn't order. We were pretty hangry at that point so we told her we'd just eat it anyway and did so we could at least get out of there. \n\nSince the service was god awful and very non-apologetic, we decided not to tip, even though that's not the norm for us. What's even better is that, as we were walking to our car, chick decides it's a good time to follow us out and ask us why we didn't tip her. \n\nWe told her exactly why.

        "text": "This is the post I left on West Bestern's Facebook page on 9-9 after an experience we had with one of their locations. Their response is below it.\n\n\"I am extremely disappointed in the experience we had yesterday at your Lakewood, NJ location. My family &amp; I left West Palm Beach, Fl ahead of Hurricane Irma. My spouse had part of his job to do in NJ so his boss told him to take the kids, cats, &amp; myself with him. We found pet friendly hotels Weds &amp; Thurs night along the way.\n\nMy spouse called your Lakewood location on Thurs afternoon, well in advance of our arrival, to make a 2 night reservation. He advised the person he spoke to that we had 2 adults, 2 kids, AND our cats. That person took the info, our credit card info, made the reservation, &amp; everything was fine. Due to traffic jams, we called around 10pm Fri evening to advise we were still on the way, and would arrive after midnight. The rep he spoke to at the location again confirmed our reservation &amp; said the room would be there for our very late check in.\n\nSo, after calling roughly 30 hours in advance to make the reservation, with full disclosure of what/who we had, &amp; a follow up call the night of arrival, imagine our shock when we finally arrived, exhausted, close to 1am last night only to be TURNED AWAY by your night clerk because the location doesn't allow pets!! With kids &amp; cats in tow, we were told essentially \"tough luck\" in the middle of the night despite TWO previous calls saying everything is fine. \n\nWe ended up having to park in an empty shopping center in the middle of the night, googling local hotels until we found one that was pet friendly with an available 2 bed room. For us to have called WELL in advance, giving full info of what we had with us, for your rep to take our info &amp; LIE that everything was fine, so we ended up scrambling last minute, desperately trying to find accommodations is NOT what I'd expect from a good hotel company. Had we been told at ANY point previously no pets, we would have had ample time to go elsewhere, instead of almost being stuck in a van overnight, until thankfully finding a room 6 calls to hotels later.\n\nI can not believe no one at the Lakewood, NJ location told us at any prior point to arrival that we would not be able to stay. We're already leaving our home unsure whether or not we'd have one to come back to, exhausted, &amp; worried. We absolutely didn't hide that we had cats. We found pet friendly hotels Weds &amp; Thurs. We called ahead to be sure your hotel was the same. For no one to tell us it wasn't &amp; to simply act like we should have known when we did arrive, despite no one mentioning it when we said we had cats, is HORRENDOUS customer service!\"\n\n\nThey responded to the post, which I made because we had been getting nowhere by calling, by contacting us from corporate. They offered us bonus member points (which was nice but not the point) &amp; informed us they had relaxed their pet rules at locations due to Irma so we certainly should have been allowed to stay. They said the night person would be retrained in regards to extreme weather situations, apologized profusely, &amp; basically responded in a nice, non-patronizing way.\n\n\nHubby travels a lot for work so his member status with them is high, so I don't know if that factored in or not, but I'm just glad they didn't write our experience off. Like I said in my post if anyone had told us before arrival \"no pets\" we'd have booked elsewhere. It was mostly just speaking to 2 different people both saying nothing about the cats we told them about, then being denied a room when we arrived late in a small town. It took almost an hour to find a pet friendly hotel with a room that late.",

I think I've been pretty clear on my needs/wants and I really just want to know the various packages and prices. 60mbs, 70mbs, or 100mbs...... \n\n **Customer Service Rep.

J:** In order to provide our customers powerful and reliable Internet service at a great value, ISP will provide modems with any Internet subscription. We want our customers’ experience to be the best possible, and the modem is a significant piece of the delivery of a great experience. ISP will always ensure its modems can support your Internet speed as a result of speed increases or upgrades. Necessary upgrades or replacements will be made free of charge. \n\n **Customer Service Rep.  J:** ISP does not have a combined modem/router unit. ISP’s modem and router are two separate pieces of equipment. The modem is a direct link from the cables outside the home that provide a hard wired signal. A router (Wi-Fi) is a piece of equipment that plugs into the modem to connect your wireless devices. Do you have your own router for wireless internet connection? \n\n**me :** I have my own modem. What is the monthly price for 100mbs package? \n\n **Customer Service Rep:** Do you have your own router for wireless internet connection? \n\n **me :** I do. \n\n **Customer Service Rep.  J:** Thank you very much, me. Please bear with me just a moment while I pull up some information for you. \n\n **Customer Service Rep.  J:** You deserve to know that for a limited time, we are offering an amazing deal which includes our blazing fast Internet Plus, Unlimited Nationwide Long Distance Phone, and a chance to experience ISP's TV Silver package FREE for 12 months, including 1 TV receiver this would be $96.96. This package includes our DigiTier 1 (family friendly programming), HBO, Showtime, and Cinemax. That is 175+ channels such as, Disney JR and XD, Nick JR, Sprout, Cooking Channel, Discovery Family, DIY, H2, Lifetime, Own, NFL Network, and many more. Traditionally Silver would be an additional $20 a month. This offer will give you a valued savings of $240 for 12 months. Would you like to take advantage of this limited time offer today? \n\n **me :** Nope, just the internet. \n\n **Customer Service Rep.  J:** If you are debating whether or not to add something, I would definitely recommend trying it out. Often times, we don't know what we are missing unless we know all the options. ISP doesn't require a contract and we are so confident you will love our service that we offer a 30 day money back guarantee on any new service added to your account. \n\n **me :** I'm really second guessing this whole switch. \n\n **Customer Service Rep.  J:** I completely understand the desire to stream programming me. I would suggest combining our ISP TV package with our Internet service to provide you additional streaming options. For example, when you subscribe to specific channels (such as FOX, ESPN, Disney, History, Lifetime just to name a few), you will have the ability to stream these channels with your mobile/wireless device. All you need is a ISP email address and password to login. \n\n**me :** I don't know why I'm still here, bored I guess. Have you ever gotten to this point, and the person your talking to say, \"Oh, you know what, I would totally love to try ISP TV plus phone. If there's one thing I need in my home its a phone. \n\n **Customer Service Rep.  J:** One moment please. \n\n**me :** sure \n \n**Customer Service Rep.  J:** Thank you. \n\n **me :** no problem \n\n **Customer Service Rep.  J:** Thank you. \n\n**me :** no thank you. \n\n **Customer Service Rep.

This offer traditionally would be an additional $20 a month. This offer will give you a valued savings of $240 for 12 months. Would you like to take advantage of this limited time offer today? \n\n **Customer Service Rep.  J:** Are you still there me? After a brief period of inactivity, this chat session will time out to protect customer account information. \n\n **me :** Well I was on the fence until you pointed out the Sprout channel. I just realized that all these years that I haven't had cable, I've been missing out on all this great Sprout channel entertainment. I don't though, limited offer, today only? That's a lot of pressure. What do you think I should do? \n\n**Customer Service Rep.  J:** I would definitely take advantage of this fantastic offer since you enjoy Sprout so much. \n\n **Customer Service Rep.  J:** Would you like me to go ahead and schedule an installation date and time for you, me? \n\n **Customer Service Rep.  J**: Are you still there me?

If for any reason you are not satisfied within the first 30 days, we will make it right or refund your money. Our 30 Day Money Back Guarantee would cover what you paid towards standard installation, monthly recurring service charges or equipment charges. \n\n **me :** Give me one moment to contemplate. \n\n **Customer Service Rep.  J:** ISP is now offering our blazing fast 60 mbps Internet Plus for $39.99 per month for 12 months when you sign up with us. After the first year, the rate will increase to the standard rate of $54.99. The service includes a free modem lease to ensure you always have the best possible connection. Would you like to take advantage of this limited time offer today? \n \n**Customer Service Rep.  J:** In order to upgrade to our Internet Ultra 100 mbps plan, there is a one-time activation charge of $199.99. This will be added to the next statement you receive and will supersede any other regular install charges. The activation cost ensures that your service is fully supported and you will be able to receive the speed due to the heavy bandwidth used on ISP infrastructure by the 100mbps service. This is an additional $40.00 per month to the cost of the Internet Plus offer. \n \n**Customer Service Rep.  J:** Which would you like to take advantage of today? \n \n**me :** Thank you. \n \n**Customer Service Rep.  J:** Thank you. Which would you like to take advantage of today? \n\n**me :** I am still considering. One moment. \n\n **Customer Service Rep.  J:** Thank you. \n\n **Customer Service Rep.  J:** Are you still there me? After a brief period of inactivity, this chat session will time out to protect customer account information. \n\n**me :** Have you ever heard of the Turring Test? \n\n **me :** *Turing Test \n\n**Customer Service Rep.

After a brief period of inactivity, this chat session will time \nout to protect customer account information. \n\n **me :** Its a concept to test A.I. in computers. The gist is that if something like 40% percent of people can’t tell if they are talking to a human or a robot, and it is a robot on the other end then the robot would pass the Turing \nTest. \n\n** me :** I can't tell. \n\n **Customer Service Rep.  J:** Thank you. Which would you like to take advantage of today? \n\n**me :** No I'm going to wait. Thanks for the info. \n\nEdits: Formatting\nEdit ?: Do you think the rep was trolling me with her response to my sprout tv bit. I thought it was copy paste or a bot until then. ",

I’ve already switched to a credit union and I’m in the process of getting my savings at my old bank switched to the new one but it’s been a headache every step of the way. \n\nI decided that I’d like to make a payment over my app of all my funds to my Credit Union account and thought it should be easy. I was wrong. I set up the payment. The soonest it could leave my account was a couple days from then so I left it at that. The next day, an automatic payment went through for something I forgot about and realized that if it pulled the amount I’d set the payment for (ie all of it) that I’d be overdraft. The app wouldn’t let me cancel so I called. \n\nI was told that it would be cancelled and I figured on my next day off I’d just go to an actual branch to get cut a check instead. The day of the payment rolls around and I check my account and the funds actually did leave my account and overdrafted the account. Lie #1. \n\nI called the bank again. I’m frustrated but I work in a call center too so I try to be very cordial when I call another call center. This time I was told that oh, they can’t actually *cancel* the payments but she sees that it’s set up so that the payment will basically leave the account and then bounce back and be credited by the next day (today). I even asked about overdraft fees and was told that because it’ll basically process at the same time as the credit is going back that I won’t get an overdraft fee. Guess what? I got an overdraft fee. Lie #2. \n\nSo I left it alone for a day. As of this morning, it had not credited me back. I was going to call at work but was too swamped. I get home and check my mail. lo and behold, there is a check in my mailbox for the amount of the payment I made. It was not cancelled at all. I was lied to all of three times. I can tell you this, it’s not going to be a fun time when I have to call back tomorrow. ",

As I'm checking out my options for one of the items, a little old lady with a cute little pupper on a leash shuffles down the aisle and stops directly across from me to check out some large storage bins. I'm one of those people that has to say something to every single dog I see, so of course I say hello to the fluffy pup before continuing my tough purchasing decision.\n\nLOL is murmuring to herself about the bins. I chance a sideways glance her way to see her attempting (but failing) to remove the very largest bin from the top of the stack directly under the top shelf. She turns to me on the spot and politely asks if I could please kindly help her.\n\nLong story short, I helped get the bin out for her, then spent the next 20 or so minutes discussing bin options for gardening while picking and choosing different ones to compare with her. Because the customer service was still in me from my shift that ended 20 minutes ago and I just couldn't muster up the courage to say no to this woman and her adorably well-mannered pup.\n\nI don't work at one of the big name retailers nor do I have experience with gardening storage, but this lady was actually super cool and made me want to sit down and have a cup of tea with her afterwards. We parted ways, her leaving with the very first bin I helped her get, and me with a smile on my face after a long day of rude customers.",

I had gotten a pair of pants from [clothing store] in our town that I loved, and found out that a city close to where we were for the event had another of the same pair (they've been clearanced out and can't be ordered online anymore). Because I've worked retail and knew this was a thing some stores do, I asked if they could be transferred to the store in my town. They said yes, the other store said yes, awesome. \n\nA week has now gone by, and I've received no call. So I call the store that was supposed to do the transfer, and find out that in fact, all store-to-store transfers have been stopped by the company. Apparently, my phone number had been recorded incorrectly, so if they had tried to reach me they would not have gotten through. The store manager there is apparently going to talk to the district manager, but isn't sure they'll have any control over the situation. Now, I am 3 hours away from this store instead of 20 minutes, so I can't conceivably drive there to get them myself. I'm quite annoyed, and apparently there are no options available. I get that it's just a pair of pants, but it's still a frustrating experience to be told there are no options even though they messed up.\n\n*Edit: missed some words.\n\n\nEdit 2: before I was told that the company had barred store transfers, I had gotten all kinds of different answers. First they said yes they do it, then someone said they'd never even heard of it before, then it sounded like they would still do it and it had just been forgotten about, and then they finally said no we can't do it and they also said they would not ship it from the store to me directly when I offered that as a solution. This was mostly what contributed to my annoyance. I dont blame anyone, because I have been there, but had I known I would have just picked them when we were still in the area.",

Our family had moved states because it was the only place my dad could find work. Our family all still lived together and we were quite leisure with our money so we went out to eat a lot. We decided to go to a restaurant that we've never been to before in the area for dinner. When we got in, it was quite packed and you could tell the staff were stressed...well except for one lady. Boy, was I wrong. She came over to take us to our booth. Didn't say much, just asked what we wanted to drink and left. While we were deciding what to order, I was looking at the kid's menu and getting upset that I couldn't order off the adult menu. My brother and dad tried to cheer me up by saying that the food that came off the kid's menu was better. Fine, I settled for mac and cheese, plus the place is known for their pasta apparently. After a long wait, our waitress returned with our drinks and was starting to take our order. Being new to the restaurant, my parents started asking about the menu. (Now angry) waitress did not like this and she picked up an attitude. After hearing too many questions, she left to get another waitress to explain the menu to us. My parents, being the inquisitive beings they are, asked angry waitress why she was upset and if we did anything cause her distress. She dismissed it and took our orders and left. Being busy, it took a while for our food to come but the moment was unforgettable.\n\nGuys, I kid you not what I received had to be nothing short of a joke. The mac and cheese I received was in one of those foam cups you would carry soup in to go. Plain macaroni in the cup with a slice of cheese on top. Stone cold and the cheese wasn't even good cheese, it was that cheese product stuff. They couldn't have used even boxed mac and cheese? My kid brain couldn't even fathom how insulting this was and I could only turn to my parents and say \"this is a joke right?\" trying to play it off as I choked back tears. Seeing I was about to break down, my brother jumped into action and actually turned it into a joke as I was not the only one unsatisfied with my meal at the table and the mood was tense. My parents called the manager and we all had our food taken back and replaced with better tasting food. I opted for chicken fingers and once we ate, we left quickly (no tip for angry waitress).\n\nUnsurprisingly, that restaurant has closed down.",

We're headed for East Midlands Airport. I must have been around 12 at the time, but the rest of my family was older.\n\nThe flight is overbooked, there's no seats left. Me and my family didn't have assigned seats, and we were told we couldn't come on the plane, there's only two seats left. My eldest sister and my mother have to be back for school and work ASAP, so they take the flight, and me, my father and other sister are told that the airline will figure something out, and that we should go back through to the main lobby of the airport (before security) and wait for them to come up.\n\nWe wait, somebody comes up to us, they've got a plane leaving to Heathrow Airport (long way from East Midlands in UK terms.) and they'll see if they can get us onto it. They come back, too late, the plane's leaving already. They have another plane; this one is leaving for Dublin. Now you may not know this, but Dublin happens to be on a **different island**. They have also stated that all travel costs will be covered, with €400 compensation each. They tell us they can get us to Dublin, a taxi to Dublin Airport Hotel, a room for the night there, a taxi back to Dublin Airport, a flight to East Midlands, a bus to the nearest train station, and a train back to my home town.\n\nThe more attentive of you may see where this is going. For the less attentive of you.\n\n\n*It's about to get a whole lot worse.*\n\n\nThey managed to get a us onto the plane to Dublin, but remember that Heathrow Plane from earlier? We ran across the tarmac as that was taxiing out.\n\nWe land in Dublin, **there's no taxi booked**\n\nWe get our own taxi to the hotel, we've been booked **under the wrong name**. We stay for a grand total of 4 hours of sleep.\n\nWe get **our own taxi** back to Dublin Airport, and we get the plane to East Midlands, \n\nWe go and talk to their help desk at East Midlands about the bus and train booked, but **they have no idea what we're talking about**.\n\nBut we make it eventually, even though mostly out of our own pocket.\n\nThere are a few things I would like to make clear to you, dear reader. \n\n+ We did not have our luggage, that was on the original flight.\n+ We kept every receipt, confirmation, ticket, everything.\n+ **They do not cover the costs, they do not pay the promised compensation, and they never talk about it again after a year of trying to get them to do so.**\n\n",

        "text": "Hey all! As the title says, this is an update to my original post, which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/70kh45/rudest_hostess_ever/) \n\nOkay, so first I'd like to clear some things up, as some of the comments in my original posts think I was leaving some information out or was sugar coating my story to make me seem like the good guy. Yes, I totally agree with everyone who made the point that it was rude of my party to be late in the first place. Had this been my party, I would have shown up at the restaurant extremely early just to make sure everything was okay. If I was held up, I would have called the restaurant and explained my situation. HOWEVER, this was not my party, and I simply showed up and witnessed what I did. It's very likely the hostess acted the way she did because our party was, in fact, creating a disturbance for their business by being late. However, that does not excuse her behavior, in my opinion.\n\nNow, for the update: I actually did end up calling the restaurant to complain. Someone picked up the phone, and I immediately asked to speak to the manager, and once I was on the phone with her, explained the situation. She was aware of what had happened, and explained that she had not been on staff the night this all happened-the hostess who had been so rude to us turned out not to be a hostess at all, but the standing manager for the evening. \n\nShe's not sure exactly what happened, as she wasn't there to witness it, but assumes the reservation somehow got mixed up or was just missed completely-they don't have an automated system that keeps their reservations, they're all written down in a book by hand, so she admitted this has happened before. She also explained that, had she been there that night, she would have done everything she could to help us-they have an outside patio that is almost never used and they sometimes make use of it in emergency situations like this one. She did admit that us coming late was an inconvenience, and they really had been booked that night, so all their tables were, in fact, reserved. So, it was simply a misunderstanding, and thankfully the manager was extremely apologetic and cooperative.\n\nSo much so that she invited us to come back this last weekend and have what she called an \"unbirthday celebration.\" We were given free appetizers, Anna got a beautiful birthday dessert, and we had another lovely evening. So, all's well that ends well! :)\n\nOh, and to top it all off, that same hostess that treated us so unfairly was nowhere to be seen! :D",

        "text": "I'll try to keep this a bit short. I stayed at a local hotel on the 10th of September. Paid through hotels.com app and never had an issue. My partner and I stayed there about 3 times a month, we live a bit far from each other, a good 45 miles apart so it's easier to get a hotel when the date has run late.\n\nI notice on my card there was two additional charges of 150.00, thus 300.00 total. I called the front desk, explained my situation and got hung up on. I called again, explained the situation and got hung up again. I pulled over thinking it was my connection and called a third time and was told \"yes, I hung up twice because I couldn't hear you.\" Okay....\n\nI explained again the situation of the charges and he asked me to wait and he'll be right back. A woman got on the line and said: *\"You god damn son of a bitch, don't think you don't remember why you got charged.\"* I was so taken aback and lost for words, I could only listen, *\"You bitch, I been working in hotels for 16 years and will NEVER forget what you did. Don't you remember the smoking in the room and about the towels!?\"*\n\nBy then I asked her to slow down, I explained I don't smoke, let alone would destroy any property. She said, *\"You don't remember me taking the towels out of your car and I should have called the police on you, you bitch!\"*.\n\nBy then I was furious, I just worked a 12 hour shift, rushed to get ready for a date with my partner. I gathered up my courage (I'm weird, I am a nurse and deal with the confused and aggressive all day, but the phone is causes me crazy anixety and angst.) I told her I wasn't that far from the hotel and would like to meet, she has me confused and she shut me down and said *\"My shift is over, I been here for 16 hours, you'll have to come back tonight at 11. I'll regonized you.\"* And she hung up.\n\nI really wanted to go to the hotel right away but traffic was ridiculous. She called me back and calmly spoke to me (weird) and said if I provided a photo of myself, my partner and the car she'll start an incident report. I emailed her immediately and still planned to go to the hotel that night. \n\nWhat bothered me is she wouldn't tell me what the thief looked like. I knew myself and my partner stand out like sore thoughts, he's Indian, full on beard and traditional garb. I'm Hispanic with the biggest afro and ass you'll ever see. So we stand out. \n\nWithin two hours later she emailed me that she would issue a refund and thanked her for \"working on this bizzarre incident\". I haven't seen a refund yet. I'll wait a few days. But I feel I should go to the hotel and speak to someone about the phone call. It bums me out that we won't ever stay at a convenient location but lesson learned. I guess check out at the front desk? I mean that's the only thing I could think this all could have been avoided. \n\n*Tl;dr: Housekeeper calls me a bitch, confuses me for a thief, charges me x4 the amount. Later refunds after emailing her about the incident.*",

She continued screaming until a nurse came out and explained the entire thing again to her, and said it wouldn't be much of wait if she wanted to see someone today.  \n  \nLady wasn't having any of this, and screamed at the nurse about how she just wanted a refill on her medications without having to talk to anyone, and how they needed to release her medications to her or else.  \n  \nEventually, she went screaming out the door about bad service, and how they were going to kill her by denying her the medication. The nurse waited about 30 seconds after her voice faded away out the building before sighing and then turning to me and saying, \"okay! You ready for your appointment?\"  \n  \n",

We had both already ordered and gotten our sandwiches, and we were sitting near the checkout in a booth. \n\n\nA man walked in, he was probably in his late 40s or so, we’ll call him Micheal (No idea what his actual name was) \nMicheal walked up to the counter and ordered very loudly. It was hard not to hear his order. \nThe girl at the counter was accompanied by an older lady, and her name tag said she was in training. New girl. When we had ordered, she had been polite and very good at her job. \nWhen it came time for Micheal to choose the vegetables he wanted on his sandwich, he looked at her and said “I don’t care.” And turned away. \nShe informed him that to continue making his sandwich, he had to choose which vegetables he wants. \nHe again said “Whatever. You’re the one making the sandwich! For gods sake, just make it.” \nThe new girl looked shaken but persisted. \n“Sir, I need you to choose your vegetables if you would like any.” \nMicheal looked exasperated, like she had just given him the most complex and hard to understand instructions out there.\n“Fine. Just put everything on there.” \nShe nodded and put every vegetable they had on the sandwich. \nWhen it came time for him to pay he announced “I sure hope this tastes good. You’ll be hearing from me if it doesn’t.” \nAnd walked out the door. \n\nThe poor new girl was shaken. We made small talk with her and her trainer after he left, as no one else was in the store. We found out that it was her first day that day. I wonder if she stayed there much longer. ",

So I'd expect decent service, right?\n\nNo greeting, but once I had about 4 items on my arm a salesperson did offer to put them in a room for me.\n\nI go to the jeans wall, where a person is stocking &amp; straightening the shelves.  She's right in the middle and kind of spread out, so I can't get to all the shelves.  I ask her if she can point me to the boot cut.  \"We have all kind of jeans, you just have to look for the ones you want\"... well, the chart you have showing you where to stock which styles says otherwise.  I find some to try without any help.\n\nI try on the 18 but want a 20, so I go back to bitchy stocker \"do you have these in a 20?\"  \"They're probably on the shelf\"... doesn't help me look or make any move to check her boxes.  I tell her they arent on the shelf and she says \"someone would have to go back to look for them\".  And I stare at her for several beats, waiting for her to go check.  \n\nThe awful, awful service continued, with the cashier screwing up so many times the cc company froze my card.

        "text": "LTL, FTP, etc. Apologies if my formatting gets messed up.\n\nThis happened a few days ago in my grocery store.\n\nI'm standing in line for checkout and it's busy all of a sudden. The lines are growing so long the ends of them are crossing beyond the end caps and into actual aisles. No big deal, customers leave a gap so those not in line can get through to continue shopping.\n\nI notice a middle-aged woman (MAW) with a full cart approaching the gap left by customers in front of the line where I bring up the rear, but instead of continuing onward, she just stops as if to get in line herself. A younger woman (YW) that MAW has just effectively cut off addresses her right away.\n\n    YW: The line is behind him (points at me).\n\n    MAW: (harsh and gruff) I'm in line. You let me in here.\n\n    YW: I was letting you pass through so you can shop, not giving you a free pass to cut the rest of us.\n\nAt this point, one of the cashiers who I'll call Sandy (not her real name) opens another line, yelling out that she can help whoever is next.\n\nMAW turns her shopping cart so harshly the wheels grind, literally grits her teeth, and aims for the just-opened checkout area, full speed ahead. The problem is that a young man with only a few items in his cart is clearly going to beat her to it. Or not, as it turned out.\n\nMAW sees the man but shoves harder and the heavy grocery cart catches the momentum from her herculean heave. The young man looks up a bit too late as her heavy cart glances off of his and she moves right past him and in front of the belt without so much as a glance or a word his way. The young man looks around at others as if to ask if that really just happened or did he hallucinate but says nothing and just shakes his head.\n\nMAW is clearly angry but I'm not sure exactly why. I watch as she begins to slam each of her items onto the belt for checkout. When I say slam, I mean she's doing it as if she wants to destroy the items, paying little attention to whether or not the item in question can withstand said slam.\n\nIf you've ever worked in a grocery store - or even shop one regularly - you can guess where this might go.\n\nI see it as if in slow motion but there was no way to stop her from where I was, and I'm not sure I'd want to even if I were closer.\n\nMAW's paw grips her carton of eggs, lifts it high, and sends it crashing down onto the belt. I know that sound. Not surprisingly, I know most - if not all - of those eggs are broken. MAW heard the noise too and tries to open the container, a copious amount of yolk starts oozing out, so she closes it with a look of disgust.\n\nSandy - the cashier - has been scanning MAW's items, having only said a cheery hello to MAW upon her arrival and gotten no response. Now MAW turns her rage on Sandy.\n\n    MAW: These eggs are broken. Bring me another one.\n\n    Sandy: Certainly, ma'am. (on store intercom) Can someone please bring a carton of (store brand) eggs to checkout number two? Thank you.\n\n    MAW: What are you doing? I told YOU to bring me the eggs. Now go get them!\n\n    Sandy: I'm sorry, ma'am but I'm really not supposed to leave the register. I'm sure your eggs will be here shortly.\n\nCue the arrival of the eggs, and Sandy double checks to make sure none are broken.\n\n    MAW: Those are (store brand) eggs. I want (more expensive name brand) eggs. Get me those!\n\n    Sandy: Sure.\n\nEveryone waits about a minute for the name brand eggs, and again Sandy double checks to make sure none are broken. Sandy has finished scanning everything else and scans the new eggs when they arrive, then tells MAW her total.\n\n    MAW: Wait, you charged too much for the eggs!\n\n    Sandy: Did I? Let's see. It looks like they're coming up as the standard price for (name brand eggs) and I don't think we have any sales on those right now, but I can check if you'd like.\n\n    MAW: No, you're supposed to be charging me for (store brand eggs), but I want (name brand eggs) for that price since mine were broken.\n\n    Sandy: (smiles) OK, ma'am, here's what we can do. I've got both brands of eggs here right now in cartons where none of them are broken. You saw me check. You can buy either one you'd like, or even both if you want, but you have to pay for whatever you want to buy. What would you like me to do?\n\n    MAW: I told you. I want the (name brand eggs) for the (store brand) price! Mine were broken!\n\n    Sandy: I understand your eggs were broken, ma'am, but we've got eggs here which aren't. Unfortunately I don't have the authority to give them to you at a discount. If you'd like, I can check you out and you can discuss this with our manager at the customer service desk?\n\n    MAW: Never mind, I'm in a hurry. I'll just take the (store brand) eggs then.\n\nSandy scans the store brand eggs, tells MAW her total, and MAW pays while gritting her teeth and seething, her breathing actually audible from where I was in the other line.\n\nSandy tells her to have a nice day and MAW grunts and once again turns her shopping cart into a battering ram. This time she aims at a stocking cart that was placed out of the main traffic area and was half full of a mountain of Halloween candy being placed onto the shelves near the front of the store. She gains speed and deliberately hits it on the end, and it moves a short distance with several bags of candy hitting the floor in a heap.\n\nAt this point, YW from earlier has finished checking out and has a shocked look on her face and is staying back from the exit area where MAW is, but speaks up.\n\n    YW: Are you going to pick those up?\n\n    MAW: (says nothing, continues pushing her cart out the door, raises her hand and its corresponding middle finger to the general region behind her)\n\n    YW: (to no one in particular) Can you believe that? The nerve of some people!\n\nIndeed.",

I've lurked here for a while and now I've decided it's time to share my own story.\n\nI don't know if I could quite be described as a \"customer\" per se, as my story is geared more towards my experience at college. But... here goes.\n\nI decided to go to a community college for my first two years of college to keep college costs down. I loved it there and was a little sad when I graduated, but I really looked forward to going to senior college. I was stuck between two choices for my senior college, which, for anonymity, we'll call L and M. I originally chose L because it was close to my job, which I also enjoy and wanted to keep.\n\nI applied to L and M at the same time. Two weeks pass, and I get my acceptance letter from M. Several months (three, at least) passed, and I get a note from L saying that I needed to send in my immunization records in order to enroll.\n\nWell... I can't find my immunization records. So I call L and tell them this. \"Oh, that's no problem!\" the lady on the phone says. \"Just sign the waiver on the back of the form and email it to us. That's usually what we tell people to do anyway.\"\n\nOkay, cool. So I fill out the waiver, scan both sides (two pages—that's important), and send them the email.\n\nI even called them back a couple of weeks after I sent the email to make sure they had gotten the form. They told me they did. (Of course, I was an idiot and didn't ask if I was actually admitted... But I knew that I had met their admission requirements, so I wasn't worried.)\n\nA few more weeks passed, and after I still hadn't received an acceptance letter, I decided to call L and see if there was any problem.\n\n&gt; Me: \"Hi, I was just calling to see if I'd been admitted?\"\n[gives verification information, etc.]\n&gt; Guy from L: \"Yes sir, no problem, let me check...\"\n[pause]\n&gt; L: \"Yes sir, it seems that we're missing the second page of your immunization compliance form.\"\n&gt; Me: \"Oh... that's strange. Maybe I just missed attaching the second page. I'll resend the email. Have a good day.\"\n[hangs up]\n[checks email, second page is definitely there]\n[resends email]\n\nTwo more weeks or so, still no acceptance letter (or any other communication) from L. By this time, I'm pretty stressed, especially as I've already rented an apartment near L.\n\nSo I call back.\n\n&gt; Me: \"Hi, I was just calling to see if I'd been admitted?\"\n[gives verification information again, etc.]\n&gt; L: \"Yes sir, it seems that we're missing the second page of your immunization compliance form.\"\n&gt; Me: \"Uhhhh... I'm sorry, I've sent it in twice now.\"\n&gt; L (cuts me off, and in a *very* smart-ass tone says): \"Oh, that's okay, sir. We get people all the time who forget to attach the second page.\"\n&gt; Me (completely pissed): \"I'm sorry, maybe I wasn't clear. I've sent both pages in twice now. I double checked both times.\"\n&gt; L (still smart-ass): \"Well, we don't have it.\"\n&gt; Me: \"Well, how about I *print it out and bring it to you?*\"\n&gt; L: \"Okay, sir.\"\n\nSo I print this godforsaken form out. Double-sided, mind you—as in, you literally *cannot* lose the second page because it is **ATTACHED TO THE FIRST ONE.**\n\nSo I go into L's office of admissions, hand the paper in, ask them if there's anything else I need to do to be admitted (they say no), and walk out. Finally, I thought. I'll be good to go.\n\nAnother week passes and I call to see if I can schedule classes. And as long as I live I will never forget this phone call.\n\n&gt; Me: \"Yes sir, I was just calling to see if I could maybe schedule classes?\"\n&gt; L: \"Okay, let me check.\"\n[verification process again, blah blah blah]\n&gt; L: \"Okay sir, it looks like you're good to schedule classes, but the only thing is that we don't have the second page of your immunization compliance form, and that's keeping you from being fully admitted.\"\n[AAAAARGH!!!! But I keep my calm. I'll see if I can get this form thing worked out with an advisor or something.]\n&gt; Me: \"Okay, I'll just go ahead and see if I can schedule my classes.\"\n\n[So I get transferred about 10,000 times, and finally land on the right guy, who we'll refer to as A.]\n\n&gt; A: \"Yes sir, how can I help you?\"\n&gt; Me: \"I was just wondering if I could schedule classes.\"\n&gt; A: \"Well, I'd love to do it in person rather than on the phone, is that okay?\"\n&gt; Me: \"Sure. That's fine.\"\n&gt; A: \"Okay, just email me and we'll set up a time.\"\n[we hang up]\n\n[I email A, and he doesn't respond for two days. The deadline to enroll is, at this point, tomorrow. I'm at the point where I just wish I could disappear.]\n\nIn his email, A basically says that since it's so close to the deadline, he'll just go ahead and put me in 12 hours' worth of classes and we can change them afterward if need be. I agree to this.\n\nI get put in these classes, and... none of the scholarships that I was promised by their recruiters showed up. So the system shows that I owe $10,000+ when I should owe less than $2,500. (This was only for one semester, by the way).\n\nI walk into financial aid at L and they can't tell me if I'm going to be able to get the scholarships or not, even though there was no deadline for them and I far surpassed the eligibility requirements.\n\nI emailed A back and basically said, \"Look, I'm sorry, but I can't do this anymore. I'm just going to have to go to M.\"\n\nSo I call M and tell them I'm really sorry I'm so late, but can I still register for classes. \"Yep! When is a good time for you to come in?\"\n\nI registered for classes successfully at M, but unfortunately I had missed M's deadline for over $9,000 worth of scholarships. (On the flip side, I'm paying in-state tuition at M, so it's still cheaper.)\n\nAnd that is the story of how a single sheet of paper and an office full of nincompoops cost me $9,000.\n\nTL;DR: University lost the second page of a form three times, including once when it was printed double-sided, and wanted to charge me $10,000 to go there.\n\nOh, and I finally got an acceptance letter from L three weeks after I had started at M. Guess they finally flipped the page over.",

As I approached the registers I notice the usual rush hour lines, counted up my groceries and returned a couple non essential items so I would qualify for the express lane checkout (15items or less)  There's only 3 people in front of me.  \n\nIm browsing through Reddit waiting my turn, when I hear several loud clangs and bangs.  I look up to see that the lady in front of me has upended her basket on the concert and out spills 100 small cans of cat food.  I look at her incredulously and say in my most polite tone, \"ma'am I know by the fact that you are wearing ______ uniform that you work here and should be well aware that you have greatly exceeded the item limit for this lane\" (or words to that effect) \n\nShe says, \"yes I'm on my break, I let 3 people go in front of me\" (as if that is justification) I  looked behind me at the 4 new customers that had come in after me, then back at her and said \"it doesn't matter if you let everyone go in front of you, you clearly don't belong in this lane, I myself chose not to purchase 2 items so I COULD use it.\" \n\nShe just smiled and turned her back to me.\n\nWhen it was her turn at the register the cashier reached for the first can and the lady behind me asks the cashier if she was seriously going to ring up her fellow employee during the middle of rush hour in the express lane.  She acts like it's no big deal, the head cashier was working 2 check stands away, was made aware of the situation and she allowed it to continue as well. \n\nIt gets better, every single one of those cans had an individual coupon that the cashier had to peel off, flip over, scan, rinse repeat.  200 barcodes later I get to purchase my 15 items and out of curiosity I walk back to the pet food aisle. Lo and behold this cat food went on sale that very day, the employee stocked the shelf, went on break, went through the express lane so her friend could ring her up. \n\n\nSummary: Grocery employee stocks shelf of sale item, takes break to purchase all available stock, takes 100 items with 2 barcodes each through express checkout so her friend can be the one to ring her up.

        "text": "So a little backstory, I'm currently staying at my MIL's friend's house watching their pets. It's 30 minutes outside of the city. Currently I only have a few pennies to my name because bills and I managed to have enough money on my credit to get some food before I get more cash (I'm a server). I went to a very popular fast food chain with a big yellow letter. \n\nSo I go into the drive through, order a burger, some fries, a shake, and a pie. I get my baggie and forget to check it while I'm at the restaurant and just drive off (My mistake I know). I snack on the fries during my drive and when I get back to where I'm staying I go to unpack my food. Except there's no burger and no pie. So I only got half of the things I ordered.\nNow like I said, I'm dead ass broke right now. So even though I only paid about 7 dollars for the burger and the pie but that's 7 dollars wasted since I didn't get the food I paid for. If I didn't get the food normally I'd just take the loss but this time I couldn't afford to. I called the big yellow letter store and a lady with a very thick Asian accent answered. She's McD lady and I'm me. \n\nMe: hi I ordered about 40 minutes ago and I don't have some of the items that I paid for. I'd like to get a refund on those items. My receipt number is blah blah. \n\nMcD: you come back and we give you missing items. \n\nMe: I'd like to but I'm currently 30 minutes away from your store and don't want to drive an hour round trip to pick up a burger and a pie. \n\nMcD: we put food in your bag. We did. It's under fries. \n\nMe: no besides fries my bag is empty \n\nMcD: then come back later today and we give you your burger and pie \n\nMe: I just said, I don't want to drive an hour just for a burger. I'd like a refund please. \n\nMcD: okay you come back tomorrow and get food \n\nMe: (at this point I don't care and I'm starting to get pissed with her) no I do not want to come back. I just want a refund. \n\nMcD: we know we put food in your bag. You lie for more food. \n\nMe: I JUST WANT A REFUND. Can you get your manager please. \n\nMcD: I will check cameras and make sure we put food in your bag. \n\nShe put me on hold for probably about 15 minutes before I hung up and called back. A different lady answered and I asked to speak to the manager. When the manager got on the phone and she was amazing. \n\nShe confirmed that even on the cameras it shows that fries are put into my bag and then the Asian lady grabbed the bag without checking it, handed it to me, and I drove away. \n\nThey refunded my entire order and she explained to me that the Asian lady would forget things every time she worked and then blame the customer for wanting to get free food. I hope she gets fired because that was exhausting. I don't want to pay for items i didn't get. \n\n\n\n\nEdit: sorry if format is fucked. Mobile. ",

        "text": "The restaurant in question here bills itself as America’s Diner.  We shall say “Lennys”\n\nThis particular Lennys has over the years earned the sobriquet among my social circle as “The Dysfunctional Lennys”.\n\nAn example, one of the first hints of dysfunctional behavior:\n\nAt the time of this tale, I had a room-mate (J) who was living in my house until he could get himself settled into his own digs, having moved from another state with little more than the clothes on his back.  He paid room &amp; board, but occasionally we’d go out to eat together if neither of us felt like cooking.  Lennys is right down the street from home, so it was a natural choice for a cheap &amp; filling meal.\n\nThe restaurant wasn’t very busy, but the first room was filled with customers, so we were seated in the back room.  No problem.  Happens a lot.   Nice busboy comes over and brings us water.  Young waiter comes to the table and gets our drink orders, goes over fills them and returns.  Puts the drinks on the table and tries to hand us straws.\n\nNow… this may be my fault, and I own it if it is, but (J) and I don’t like drinking out of straws.  So we handed them back to the kid, who looked quizzically at us and said “You don’t want straws?” to which I replied “No – we don’t suck”\n\nThe kid took our straws, and took our order, and went back to the kitchen.\n\nAnd never returned.  After about 20 minutes, the busboy came by again, and we asked if we could get refills on the drinks (iced tea).  Busboy brought them.\n\nAbout 20 min. again, (J) went up to the checkout to ask about our food.  Was told the kitchen was busy, but should be up shortly.  \n\nAnother 15 minutes, and we’re getting miffed.  (J) goes and asks for a manager.  Manager brings us our salads, and goes back to find out what happened.  While we’re eating the salads, the manager comes back.  Apparently our waiter just walked out the back door after leaving our table.  Walked out.  Quit without saying a word.  The manager comped our meals, which was nice, but really not necessary.  The part I’ll always remember is we asked to see the busboy when we were through.  We gave him the tip we would have left for the waiter.\n\nHe was very upset – did not want to take it – but we told him he deserved it because he gave us more service than the waiter did.\n\nTL;DR - Waiter quits before delivering our order, possibly due to my smartass remark\n",

As I've been lurking, it brought to mind an encounter that happened to me a couple of years back.\n\nI was shopping at a discount shoe store and I was ready to check out. There were two cashiers and it was very very busy. Both lines were four people deep. I was the fourth person in line for my cashier. As I stood in line I watched her interacting with her customers and she was being rude, IMO. She was curt, harsh, and almost angry. I know that the store was busy but the other employee was handling the rush much better. She was smiling and engaging her customers.\n\nObviously I don't know the history. Was my person new? Did her boyfriend or girlfriend just break up with her? Did she just find out there was a death in her family? Was the other person the manager? Or did she just get a raise? Who knows.\n\nIt was finally my turn. I could have handled it one of two ways. I could have put my shoes on the counter and have been snarky with her like she had been with the previous customers or I could have been sweet as pie. I decided to be sweet as pie--I decided I needed to turn her day around. So, I put my shoes on the counter, gave her my best smile, and said \" hi! It looks like you're having a rough day. I hope everything's ok and it gets better.\" She actually smiled at me. She thanked me. She completed my transaction. And I left.\n\nI don't know how the rest of her day went. But I hope that it was better because of one strangers small gesture.\n\nEdit: spelling\n",

Why did they open those?\n\nTL: Well, no harm was done to YOU, so it should not be a problem.

Just travel around the country?\n\nBM: Good question! (*Strolls away munching on a sandwich, contently*)\n\nTL: Ok, well, now to that autopayment😊\n\nMM: I understand that you would not close the accounts if that was a person coming on my behalf, but those tiny amou ts of money and me having no knowledge of these accounts is a clue that this is not a normal situation.\n\nTL: Ok,  the autopayment is done. Well, I sympathise with you but I can't help you. Such is life! Have a nice day 😊\n\nUS: Nice day to you too.

I'm also on mobile and TL;DR is at the bottom.\n\nAlright, so about 4 months ago I bought some clothes from an online subscription service that picks clothes according to your style and sends them to your home. Pretty cool, right? ...Yeah, I thought so too.\n\nAnyway they have a policy that states that if you want to postpone or cancel your next package you need to contact them within 10 days of receiving your last package... Alright, no problem. I wanted to postpone my next package as I was pretty happy with the clothes I got and didn't really want to spend another $100+. So I let them know a week after getting my package and all was good in the hood. \n\n...Until it wasn't.\n\nDuring the month my package was postponed, family and personal issues came up that made me pretty strapped for cash. Not much I could do, just how life works sometimes. Now being short for cash I needed to start looking for ways to better budget my money. One was canceling my subscription to this clothing service. \n\nHere's where my trouble starts...\n\nI got an email from them after my month of postponement stating they were going to charge my account for my next package... I then email them right away letting them know that... hey stuff came up, I can't afford my next package. I need to cancel the whole thing.\n\nThey tell me no. Straight up, they say they can't close my account.\n\nWhat?\n\nHere's why, supposedly... remember that policy I told you about? Yeah here's where they get you. Because I didn't cancel my subscription within the 10 days after my package was received the account can't be closed... no idea why. \"It's just policy\" I kindly let them know that I did contact them within the 10 days to postpone... stuff came up between then and now... And now I want to cancel. So what's the problem here?\n\nThey repeat their policy back to me. I repeat that I literally do not have the funds and shit came up in between then and now and I don't want the clothes anymore. Then they tell me if I want to cancel I'll have to purchase another package and then contact them to close it... You're shitting me, right??\n\nDuring this conversation keep in mind they haven't actually charged my account yet so I ask \"I see you haven't charged my account yet, how hard is it to just not charge my account?\" They totally side step the question and just repeat the policy back to me for a 3rd time...\n\nI'm done at this point... I just want my account closed.\n\nSo after all this back and forth we finally come to a stalemate and the woman just puts it as this : I can pay for another package and then cancel or I can postpone my account for another 2 months and by then hopefully I will have enough funds to buy another.\n\nYeah, fuck no.\n\nI may have lost that battle but I was determined to win the war... I ask them to postpone my account for 2 more months. After that was taken care of I went down to my bank and closed the card attached to the account. They are not going to get anymore of my money, not if I can do anything about it at least.\n\nSo to wrap this up they've been emailing me all week trying to charge my account (gotten 4 already) and every time I see their email pop up it feels like a small little victory. I know it's not much for all that's went down... but fuck them! they're trying to force me into buying another package when I clearly can't and don't want to.\n\nI've been really tempted to just tell them I closed the account so they stop wasting their time... but it's such a ridiculous and anti consumer friendly policy that I'm just gonna let it be and walk away with my small win.\n\nTL;DR: clothing subscription tries to force me to buy another package after I ask to close my account. I have them postpone my charge for 2 months give me enough time to close my card associated with the account.",

        "text": "Went to this Mexican style burrito place with my housemate. We got few beers, appetizers and main courses. We were pretty much only ones in there, enjoying some quiet time while observing busy night street below us. Staff was all friendly and things went smooth. After we finished our foods and beers, it was time for us to head out. So far 5* review.\n\nBill was a bit less than €50 and I thought to add €10 tip plus change to make it even €60. Quite reasonable, right? (Units are roughly same in freedom money $$). So, total would be €60 (about $60 too!).\n\nWe asked for the check and they brought it in this leather folder. I look at it and no problem, pull out my wallet and take 3 crisp €20 notes.\n\nThen, a small devil inside me decides to pull a \"harmless\" prank. It makes me to fold the notes, not directly on center line, but a bit diagonal fold and me to place them carefully in the leather folder, so each note that sticks out the leather case, looks like 4 notes. After few adjustments, it looks like it has 12x €20 notes in this nice fan-formation, instead of actual 3 notes.\n\nWe put our coats on and and walk downstairs, approaching the exit when I hear: \"My god, wohooo, this is so awesom.. ...wait.. MOTHER FUCKER! WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK! FUCKING DICK CHEESE EATING BITCH!\"\n\nA bit unexpected reaction for 20% tip, no?\n\nOtherwise, I would just keep laughing and leave (he'd get €10 tip anyways), but the small devil inside me had to intervene, as the hostess at the door starts to turn red with her eyes rounding up while everyone is hearing the servers rant. \n\nI asked the hostess: \"Why that waiter calls me M-F and all those other names, after us behaving like model customers and also tipping him 20%? This really hurts my feelings and likely will ruin rest of our lovely evening. What would be suitable amount of tipping then, on €50 bill? Is this a proper way to handle business and thank the customers? Maybe this is the exact reason why you have no other customers here.\" and I stand there looking for response from the hostess.\n\nI was just about to burst into laughter and thank them again and leave, she opens her mouth to say something, but loud shouting upstairs resumes, interrupting her: \"Those fucking idiots who just left fucking messed up the tips! Aaaah! M-F's! Fucking great!\" and so on. While continuing with his curses and ranting, the server walks downstairs and notices all 3 of us staring back at him.\n\nHe stops in middle of the stairs and without a word, he walks to me, opens the leather folder, gives my money back to me, apologies quickly and goes away somewhere in the staff area. Hostess tells me: \"No charge this time. We are so sorry about what just happened. I hope you can forgive us and we get you here again.\"\n\nI try to explain it as a joke to the hostess and offer still to pay whole bill. She understands, thinks it's a good one, but she keeps refusing for my payment, because of the language used towards us. \n\nEventually, I hand out one of the €20 bills back to her and say: \"No problem. If the food was free, that's great, thank you, but here is still some tips for you for the service.\" I also apologized for appearing to leave 200% tip instead of 20%.\n\nMaybe I was the idiot here instead of the waiter who called me Motherfucker and such. Nevertheless, us customers had really good laughs afterwards and are planning to go there again, but not really sure are we welcome or not...\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nEDIT: I'm not that great of a story teller, but based on the feedback, I must mention that the actual server was LAUGHING too, while he was cursing at us (prob 19yr guy). We had few nice conversations with the server during the meal and he clearly had a very good sense of humor (we were joking about dead ass/donkey being fed to us and he confirmed that to be the case and he added that bottles of beer were bottled donkey piss to match the flavor, topped off with a lime). Based on his body language and overall behavior, he was actually enjoying this little prank too as it would have otherwise very boring night us being pretty much only customers. He was all happy for the €10 tip when he was coming downstairs, while using not-so-customer-friendly language. \n\nIt was just the \"sailor\"-language he used at the wrong moment that was point of this story, and that might have gotten him fired. None of us; the customers, hostess and server weren't pissed off or angry at any point, but just frisky language was used that might lead to serious trouble amongst the staff.\n\nSame might happen to me: \"Oh look at this motherfucker who can't fix his thing, instead brings it to us.\" while customer is right behind me (or phone line un-muted), as I thought he was in wait area (or in hold), while my comments are meant for my colleagues only and I'm using frisky language. That might get anyone fired, if customer would decide to act on it. At least I and many of my colleagues constantly use non-suitable language about our customers while they can't hear us, still without us being pissed off or really meaning any of it.\n\nPoint of this story was not that someone would have gotten angry (only readers did so far), but just use a bit too frisky language towards customers. Seems like reddit got angry in behalf of the server, who kept his professionalism after he realized we heard his offensive language.\n\nBesides, the server pulled a prank on me too, by first delivering me a some veggie plate and water, laughed and instantly swapped my plate for the one I ordered and provided the beers.\n\nAlso, might not be entirely clear about this, as english is not my first language, but no servers were harmed during the making of this story.

He was this white gray haired guy in a baseball cap. And I fuck you not, he hands me my food, has me sign the receipt and then starts asking me about politics and Michigan children being dumber now, and something about de-evolution, and Michigan being out of the loop of the rest of the world and america being out of the loop. Something about the hurricane in Puerto Rico says something about the Irish army or some shi. \n\nI'm getting really uncomfortable, winded, and my heart pounding in my chest because of anxiety. I'm trying to talk back like I know what's going on, and I mention the common core learning testing thing because it's the only thing I can get to come out of my mouth, I'm slowly inching the door closed like, \"lalala don't freak out\" in my head, and he's says: \n\n \"I'm not from Michigan, I'm from planet Earth.\"\n\nAnd finally after almost TEN MINUTES of me standing with my door half open, in my goth ass pajamas with my pink as cotton candy hair, and no coat or shoes, pouring sweat from my nervousness, I'm like YUP SURE DOES SIR, HAVE A GOOD EVENING. and he mentions Obama being in Puerto Rico two years ago and how the Media never told us, then finally goes down the stairs and I close the door. \n\nIt takes me about five minutes to figure out what the hell just happened before taking my food to the kitchen to eat.",

        "text": "Hi, r/TalesFromTheCustomer. I'm posting here for the first time. I guess I need some place where I can vent and I knew there was a subreddit like this based on what I read once some time ago on /r/talesfromtechsupport. I tried to look up relevant stuff on the sidebar there and realized that you guys really do exist. Anyway, let's get to my story.\n\n---\n\nSo, in this tale, I'll be talking about the stuff I've been experiencing over the course of the last month or so with a certain Internet payment service. Let's call them Casher. I myself will be me, I, u/anothga or whatever else feels appropriate at the moment.\n\nThis is a service that I already used a couple of years ago, before I discovered the alternative that is cryptocurrency. In the mean time, I discovered cryptos themselves have their limitations, they're not accepted everywhere, and Bitcoin, the one that's definitely the most accepted one, has heen having serious transaction fee issues in the last couple of months, making it too expensive for me to use. So, some month and a half ago, I decided to go back to the Casher.\n\nNow, I still had some 15 or so bucks left in the Bitcoin. It was a leftover from a much larger amount of stocks dividend money that I received some two to three months ago. This is relevant because Casher just so happened to be accepting deposits in Bitcoin. So, I registered again, added a credit card and deposited the Bitcoin.\n\nUnfortunately, because of the fees, like I already said, those 15 bucks turned into ~10 bucks, but okay.\n\nThen I discovered Casher issues special prepaid Casher-branded Mastercard card. That was perfect! An internet payment service that accepts all credit cards I can use at this moment AND enables me to use the deposited money with their own Mastercard card, which is guaranteed to be accepted everywhere because it's the bloody Mastercard? And it costs only 10 euros on annual basis? Brilliant!\n\nSo, I applied for the card, paid the 10 euros fee and it arrived some 2 weeks later. I still had some money left from the Bitcoin deposit *and* I deposited a bit more. Then I tried to test the card with a smaller amount.\n\nFirst website, second website, third website. Declined, declined, declined.\n\nOkay, some problem with a card. I did activate it, so that shouldn't be a problem. It's to the customer support then.\n\nThen I realized their support system is a bit weird, at least by my standards. Basically, as I realized over this month, you send an e-mail to their support and that opens a brand new ticket in their system, and then they reply. When you try to contact them back, even with a reply to their reply, it opens an entirely new ticket. Ugh.\n\nCompare that to Paradox's support. Yes, the same Paradox that works on Crusader Kings and Stellaris. They have a dedicated support section on their website, where you need to select the proper type of your problem (helps narrow it down) AND all communication is kept within the one and the same ticket. Much better if you ask me. Probably would have helped here too.\n\n*Anyway*, I open the ticket and describe my situation. After a couple of days, I receive the answer: \"u/anothga, the problem is in the fact that you made a Bitcoin deposit. Bitcoin deposits cannot be used on Casher Mastercard cards, only non-Bitcoin deposits. You can even see the warning when you make a Bitcoin deposit.\"\n\nI felt silly. \"Of course,\" I thought and laughed at myself, and then *somehow* completely emptied my entire Casher balance and deposited an entirely new money presumably not tainted with Bitcoin.\n\nKeyword: presumably.\n\nAgain, I try to make a purchase. First website, second website, third website. Declined, declined, declined. What could *possibly* be a problem *now*? I didn't have any Bitcoin money left, so what gives?\n\nI contact the support for the second time, this time saying Bitcoin appears to not be the problem. Again, I wait a couple of days and then I get the answer: \"Please try again within 24 to 48 hours. If the problem persist, contact us.\"\n\nOkay. then. I guess the problem got solved?\n\n[nope.avi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvdf5n-zI14)\n\n*Okay*, third visit to the support. I make a direct reply to the second reply, together with a complete quote of what they said, which is when I realized that part about every new e-mail opening an entirely new support ticket. I did not expect that, otherwise I would have written the e-mail differently. Oh well, I guess the person doing it will look at the previous ticket and realize what's the problem.\n\n*Again*, I waited for a couple of days before I got the answer. \"u/anothga, the problem seems to be your Bitcoin deposit. You can't use those for the Casher Mastercard card.\"\n\nAt this point, I felt my blood presure rising. \"**I already ruled out the fucking Bitcoin!** Did you even read what I wrote in the previous ticket? If not, how the hell did you guess what's my problem right? From that bit of text I just happened to have copypasted to my newest e-mail?\"\n\nI probably should have mentioned every single ticket was apparently \"solved\" by a different person. If it all were a same person, or if they actually used a proper support system, like Paradox, this wouldn't have been a problem.\"\n\nAt this moment, I decided to write a fourth e-mail. This time, I carefully wrote about the timeline of the problem and specifically emphasized Bitcoin can't possibly be the problem. I literally had no money left from that deposit!\n\nThis time, I waited only two days *and* got two replies. First reply stated my problem got elevated to a higher support level. \"Aha!\", I thought. \"Based on my /r/talesfromtechsupport experience, I should now be talking with someone who has more power and/or experience.\" The second reply stated, basically, to retry a payment. Surely ***now*** it should work, right?\n\nRight?\n\nFirst website, second website, third website. Declined, declined, declined.\n\nAt this point, I was on the brink of a breakdown. The entire month of failure and waiting. Four different tickets, one per week. First I felt like raging, which I probably would have, were I home alone, then nearly cried. 15 dollars went down the drain, money I could have used better, for example, to buy that Humble WFRP Bundle that's still on sale right now, or that Raeve Maeve skin in Paladins. Damn it, I really want(ed) to get that silly, cutesy skin for the best catgirl loli, but I had to use what fiat money I had at the moment to buy a birthday present for my mother. Yes, I know it sounds ridiculous, but I really wanted that skin and that's what nearly got my crying.\n\nJesus. I'm pathetic.\n\nAt the end, I cancelled the card, spent what little money I had via Steam, deactivated my Casher account and finally replied to that survey I got in regards to the first ticket. I completely trashtalked them in fury and then personally woved to not use them ever again, even if they were the last option I had available.\n\nBecause, with support like that, I can't afford to possibly lose even more money. Thank God it was \"only\" 15 euros now, and even that made me fucking depressed.",

        "text": "Note: This is long. I'm sorry.  There's a TL;DR at the bottom, but I think you need to see the entire saga to understand the level of my frustration and anger I'm dealing with right now.\n\nAll the times I've seen people complaining about a certain cell service provider (yes, that one), I always thought, I've never had a problem with them and I've been a customer since 1993 and I think they're great.  No more. They're dead to me now.\n\nI dropped my phone (Galaxy S4) and shattered the screen. Instead of placing an insurance claim, I decided to get a new phone. I was dismayed to learn they don't give discounts on upgrades anymore. I called customer service to see what my options were.  The rep told me I had to buy the phone but they split it into 24 monthly payments. Okay, still not happy, but maybe I'll take my husband's phone and he'll buy a new one.\n\nRep says they're going to take $20/month off my line access fee of $40 (whatever that is) so if my new phone is $480, then the $20/mo. phone payment will be cancelled out and my bill will stay the same, which is $61.50/month.  Great! I tell her I'll look at the available phones and call back.\n\nI decide on the LG V20, which is $24/mo., so it'll raise my bill only $4.  I call back.  The rep says she has no idea about the $20 off, she doesn't see any discounts on the phone. I tell her it's not the phone, it was whatever phone I pick. She says she doesn't see anything anywhere. At my insistence, she keeps looking and suddenly, she sees I can get $15 off my line access fee, and my line access fee is only $15 to begin with. (Not true, as I would later find out.) After the $15 deduction, my bill would only go up about $9/mo, which is more than the $4 previously promised, but ok, fine. I am told my final bill including taxes and insurance would be $69 and change. Good. She sends me an email with a link to confirm I accept this deal.\n\nProblem:  my account is a business account I opened when I had a small business.  That business has been gone about 15 years.  The verification process needs me to enter the last 6 digits of the tax ID#. I only remember 4 because that's all anyone has ever asked for.  The business has been dead so long, all paperwork is shredded. In the past when I asked an employee about switching to my name, they discouraged it.  Probably because they were too lazy. So here I am unable to verify my order.  I call customer service again.\n\nThey can't tell me the 2 digits I need.  They say I have to switch the account holder to my name, but the account will remain the same, only the name will change, my plan will stay, which is good because it's better than the ones offered now. Great. I do this on the phone. This includes them running a credit check, so thanks for the points that'll take off my score. The email to verify comes, and it takes about 7 tries because it's not showing up on the website.  At one point she cancels the whole thing and starts over. We finally confirm it, and now the account is in my name.\n\nBut she had to cancel the pending phone order because it wouldn't let us switch while there was an open order. So now we have to re-do the entire phone order. Same plan, check. V20, check. Get the email to verify, I put in my social instead of tax ID, it works, great, thanks have a nice day.\n\nI get an email confirming my new phone and that my monthly bill will be $90 and change. What??? I was told $69!  I call AGAIN.  I explain my problem and the woman... just disappears. No one on the line.  I call YET AGAIN.  This time I explain my problem and she says let me check your file... and I hear ringing and a new person picks up. I ask for a supervisor.  She says there's none on duty. Bullshit. But fine, maybe she can help. I explain the problem a third time.\n\nAnd I get told my bill won't be $90, it'll be $103!  It's not the same account, it can't be, because this is personal not business. And I can't keep my same plan because that's just for business.  And she doesn't know anything about taking money off a line access fee, she's never heard of it. She's not customer service, she's in the line switching department. She says she doesn't want to give me false information. I say, \"Really? You're the first.\"\n\nOk, switch me back. I want to go back to what it was. No new plan, no new phone. Let's undo all of it. She says that's not possible, for whatever reason.\n\nI say, \"You know what? I'm done with this. I'm done with you and your company. I'm going to refuse delivery of the new phone and I'm going to another company and switching my phone number that I've had with you for over 20 years.\"  Her reply: \"I'm sorry you feel that way.\"  OH MY GOD, I AM SO DONE WITH YOU. \n\nTL;DR:  Lying or gross incompetence screws me out of a grandfathered account plan -- add my name to the endless list of people burned by the big red checkmark.  When the revolution comes they're going to be the first up against the wall.  (Well, maybe not the first, but it'll be quick.)\n\nP.S.:  There's an open bill on the \"old\" account and I'm considering not paying it. What are they going to do? The company's been dead for years. Fuck 'em.\n\n\n\n",
