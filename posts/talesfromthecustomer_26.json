        "text": "This is long, I'm on mobile, I'm new to posting blah blah... \n\nMy boyfriend and I decided to celebrate our anniversary at our favorite restaurant. We were seated quickly. BF and I make it pretty obvious we're a couple, holding hands across the table and all. Maybe this was a bad idea (we live in a pretty homophobic area). When our waitress arrives she immediately sighs. Okay, must just be having a bad day. \n\nBF and I order our drinks. Waitress sets the drinks down and immediately turns away, just as I'm saying \"thank you\". Usually after we get our drinks we are asked if we're ready to order but not this time. She must have been busy, but it felt sort of rude.\n\nFew minutes later the waitress comes back and asks if we're ready to order. She has a bit of an attitude about it (as if we are wasting her time) but I ignore it. We order quickly, and I have to ask for a customized meal because the dish comes with something I can't eat. Basically I just ordered a quesadilla without the onions and peppers they usually put in. The waitress asks me twice if I'm sure I want it without the onions and peppers, yes I'm sure, she leaves the table. \n\nBF and I go back to talking. We're having a pretty animated conversation in half ASL and half spoken English because my boyfriend isn't fluent in ASL yet. Our waitress comes back with our food and gives us a really weird look. She kinda rolls her eyes and almost slams our dishes down. It gave both of us the feeling she was annoyed with us for being animated or something. We weren't loud with our voices, just with our hands. I can only assume she didn't recognize it as ASL and thought we were just being dramatic gays. Or maybe, like everyone who sees bilingual people, she assumed we were talking about her?\n\nA few minutes into our meal she comes back and drops the bill off. We had barely dug into our food and I was expecting her to come back to ask how it was, or at least wait until we were almost finished to give us the bill. BF and I had just decided to share a dessert after our dinner and I felt bad about asking her to put that onto the bill after she had printed it, especially because she gave us attitude. \n\nWe finished our main course, then she brought the dessert out along with the new bill. The restaurant is popular for this dessert, and it usually comes with strawberries, cream, and caramel. Our piece came with just the cream and caramel, and it was a pretty sad presentation in general. We had to ask for a second spoon even though I specified the dessert was to share, but she tried getting us to order a separate dessert instead. This dessert is commonly shared, and it usually comes with several spoons anyways. We had to wait a bit for the second spoon but eventually she dropped it off. \n\nWe finish eating, and even if the presentation of the dessert was lacking it was delicious. I check the bill and bring out my phone to calculate the tip. I was unhappy with how she treated us but I gave her the benefit of the doubt and left just a little over 20% (a decent tip in my area). I paid in cash and when the waitress came to collect it she said \"I'll go get your change\" and I said she can keep the change. She paused and looked kind of shocked. \n\nBF and I are college students so I guess she assumed we would stiff her? She said \"thank you\" (which was the only nice thing she had said the entire time she served us) and left. She seemed sorry for having an attitude with us. \n\nBF and I left, and when we got outside we both just kind of looked at each other in shock. We had never had such a bad experience at that restaurant, and we really felt unwelcome. We're definitely going to be going back to the restaurant (we both love it too much), but I'll be wary if we get the same server. \n\nJust because we're young and loud it doesn't mean we won't tip. \n\nUpdate: BF and I went out on a date again tonight and guess where we went? Same place. Guess what server we got? Same girl. I couldn't make this up if I tried folks. \n\nShe hasn't improved her server skills (or human decency skills) so I left a survey on the restaurant's website. If we go there and get the same girl again I'm going to have to ask we get a different server. I'd never considered doing that before (I'm very shy and non-confrontational) but I'm a bit fed up with being treated like this when I go out to eat. I hope her manager reads the survey and helps her improve her skills because it's been just under a year now and she should have learned. \n\nMy tip was good, again, because everybody deserves a living wage. \n\n\n",

        "text": "A little background. I have been living in China for about three and a half years now, I am originally from the the States though, and I stick out a bit here because I'm six foot six and white. I speak Chinese and do my best to get along in a culture that is different than my own. Understand that what this woman did is rude in both American and Chinese culture, and that I'm translating our conversation (as best I can) into English. Me will be me and RL will be rude lady.\n\nI was standing in line at a big chain burger place (yes China has them, and yes they are just as terrible as in America). There is one customer in front of me and two middle school girls behind me (you can tell from the uniform). Just as the guy in front of me finishes a woman and her husband walk in, they go around me and cut me in line so they can order. \n\nMe: \"excuse me but I was next can you please wait in line\"\n\nRL : turns around and gives me a blank stare, so I repeat myself (many people assume foreigners can't speak Chinese, at least in my experience). \"I will be be fast I just want ice cream\"\n\nMe: \"I understand, but I have been waiting, can you please wait in line\"\n\nRL: \"I just want ice cream you can wait\"\n\nIt wasn't just what she said but her rude condescending tone that got to me.\n\nMe: (a bit louder) \"why do you not know to wait in line, even small children know how to do this but you don't know how?\"\n\nRL: \"I don't care, you can wait, I don't have to listen to a foreigner\"\n\nThis whole time her husband and the cashier are just standing there with their jaws open.\n\nMe: \"Listen to me you mannerless idiot, I was next and you can go to the back of the line\"\n\nRL: \"I refuse you (insert derogatory term here)\n\nFinally a manager bustles over and explains to the lady that she can either wait in line or leave. She huffs and storms out with husband in tow. The manager apologizes to me and lets me order my food. While I'm eating the middle school girls from behind me in line come up and tell me that my Chinese is really good and that the lady was really rude. I tell them thanks and that it's okay there are rude people all over the world.\n\n",

We have what we like to call \"solo dates\" which is once every other week we go out to dinner by ourselves, maybe a movie, shopping etc just to have time to ourselves. So I went to a restaurant and I was seated and the waitress (W) went up to me to ask my drink but before she did she asked:\n\nW: \"is there more coming? Family? A boyfriend or girlfriend?\"\n\nMe: \"No ma'am its just me\" I explain to her the solo date concept\n\nW: \"thats ridiculous! A young girl like you needs to socialize at all times! Your poor girlfriend probably doesnt like doing that sort of thing. Its pretty selfish\"\n\nMe: \"well its what we like to do plus it was her idea\"\n\nSo she took my drink order and I thought that was that. She came back with my drink and I ordered my food\n\nW: \"you should order the food for her to take home now so you dont have to later\"\n\nMe: \"oh no she ordered take out\"\n\nW: \"uh ok\" *walks away*\n\nSo then I waited until I got my food ate and all was well. Well I ordered a dessert.\n\nW: \"gonna take it home to split with your girlfriend?\"\n\nMe: \"nah I'm gonna eat it all\" I say with a fake laugh\n\nW: \"wow you are really selfish\" she said and walked away before I could say another word\n\nWhen the waitress brought my dessert I also got the bill since I requested it with the dessert. I wrote down on the tip area on the bill \"next time dont be a condescending cunt\" along with the exact amount of money next to it so I could just leave it there and leave\n\nIf you're a waitstaff stop trying to put your nose in other peoples business",

        "text": "This is I think the second time I've posted on this sub, because I never really have bad experiences with customer service personnel, so I never have reason to vent here. I work in customer service, in a retail setting, so I understand how people can be, and how frustrating it is sometimes, but this story is just ridiculous. \n\nThis happened a few weeks ago, and up until now I had forgot about it. I was reading another story on here from a long time ago, and was reminded of it. \n\nIt was a Saturday or Sunday, I can't remember which, in the morning, and my dad and I decided we were going to go to our local coffee stand to get a morning coffee. Now, the thing is, this coffee stand is usually super friendly. They are a chain, but they also like to be super personable and try to connect with the customer when able to, and I really appreciate that. I think a lot of the people that work there are wonderful, and I really do consider them my little coffee family. I've been going to this stand since it opened in 2013, so about four years. In those four years, a lot of the original workers have been replaced, rotated, or quit, so I see a lot of new faces. In the last few months, I've seen *a lot* of new faces, like way more than usual, so it seems like a really high turn over rate now. \n\nAnyway, my dad was driving, and we decided to go through drive through. We pull up to the speaker, and the girl working it was immediately a little sour. \n\n&gt;Girl: \"Hello?\"\n\nWe had just pulled up, and hadn't even begun to order or speak yet, and she was saying 'hello' really loudly, and she sounded kind of irritated to boot. \n\n&gt;Dad: \"Hi, how are you today?\" \n\nMy dad is super nice to retail and food workers, because both my mom and myself work in retail and he knows how people can be, so he does his best. \n\n&gt;Girl: \"Great. What do you want?\"\n\nNow, what she said wouldn't have been too bad if she wouldn't have said it super snottily like she did. It really left a bad taste in my mouth. My dad looked at me, and gave me that wide eyed stare, like what did I do look. \n\nMy dad started to tell her his order, and she got *mad*. I don't like to exaggerate, but really that's the only way I can describe her tone of voice, and how she acted next. \n\n&gt;Girl: \"Listen, sir, you need to slow down. I can't hear you at all.\" \n\nMy dad was super taken aback at that. His temper started coming out then, and my lord does he have a temper. It probably didn't help matters that the girl said it very loudly and very condescendingly. \n\n&gt;Dad: \"Oh sure, maybe you can hear me better like this. I WANT (order, but he's yelling it into the speaker), thank you! Hope you got it.\" \n\nI know he could have been a little nicer, but at the same time, the girl had cut over him before, very rudely, and said she couldn't hear him at all. I could also hear a lot of chatter in the background, so I also assumed that it was busy inside and there was a lot of noise. \n\n&gt;Girl: \"Yeah, I didn't get any of that.\" \n\nShe didn't even seem fazed, just annoyed, and very unprofessional. My dad was about to pop a vein, he was really pissed. \n\n&gt;Dad: \"Okay, just one more time. I would like an (order), please.\" \n\nHe was so nice this time, even though I could tell he wanted to kill her, he really tried that time. \n\n&gt;Girl: \"Ugh! He won't shut up!\"\n\nThere was no mistaking it this time, the girl was talking about my dad. We had no idea who she was talking to or why, but she was talking to someone the whole time she had been 'trying' to take our order, and was apparently pissed off that our order had interrupted her conversation.  She apparently also did not realize that her headset microphone was still on, and that we could hear everything she was saying. I heard another person laugh in the background, so at that point even I was done and pissed off. My dad, though, he was worse. \n\n&gt;Dad: \"Yeah, you know what? Sorry about this, but fuck you. I've tried ordering three times now, and you're talking to someone in there. I just heard you tell your coworker that I wouldn't shut up. I'm done.\" \n\nI heard the click of the headset, I think it was turning off. She heard everything he said perfectly fine then, and I think she was probably shitting herself.\n\nSo we didn't order anything, but we had to wait in line because we were boxed in by another car. When we got to the window, there was a girl standing there, but we found out quickly that it wasn't the girl who had been extremely rude. She was the manager. \n\n&gt;Manager: \"I heard what happened out there, and I'm so sorry you guys. She's new, and it's not working out with her. I'm glad I was able to witness it though, because otherwise I wouldn't have known, she wouldn't have told me.\"\n\nApparently the manager had walked up right around the second time we were trying to order, and the manager could hear the headset, and my dad being super polite, and she was watching her just chat away with some other coworker, and then going back to our order all irritated and asking us to repeat it in less than friendly manners. By the third time, when my dad got fed up, the manager, who is a super sweet woman, finally told the girl to take off her headset and give it to another coworker and to just wait for her in her office. The manager was so embarrassed by her employee, I honestly felt bad for the manager. She gave us two drinks for free and told us how sorry she was again for everything, and that we would hopefully return. My dad and I told her that of course we would return, because we know how it can be sometimes. \n\nI just wish I was making that up honestly. I get that some people really hate their jobs, but honestly, if you're working drive through, you've got to be kind of careful how you talk, because we can't see your face and see your emotions, only the tone of your voice, and it can really sound bad. Obviously in this case, it really *was* bad, but I just was dumbfounded by how angry this girl seemed. But I've been back since and haven't seen or heard from her, so I'm assuming she was fired. I really didn't intend for anyone to get fired, but honestly she probably should not have been working in customer service. ",

He was third in line and was holding all of his items in his hands, so it wasn't like his checkout would take long by any means.\n\nThis middle aged women was the cashier, and checking everyone out. Everything was fine until the lady in front of my dad finished checking out.\n\nMy dad starts to place his stuff on the conveyor belt, the cashier see's this and proceeds to then shut off the check out light and stick the \"This check out line is closed\" sign on the belt in front of my dad. Then waits and looks at my dad like \"what are you waiting for?\"\n\nMy dad: \"Seriously? I was waiting here in line and now you say the check out is closed?\"\nCheck out lady: \"That's not my problem\"\n\nBy all means close the cash register, but let the people that line up know ahead of time so they can find another check-out if you won't be able to cash them out. But no, this lady ran on her own time apparently. It's just decency.\n\nSo my dad being my dad, drops the rest of whats in his hand on the conveyor belt, and gives her a big ol \"F*** you\" and walks out. While she stands there with her jaw dropped.\n\nUnfortunately idk who actually had to clean that stuff up, hopefully her manager made her do it instead of customer service.\n\nBut I hear this story annually as family dinner table discussions always end up at crazy/interesting customer experience stories lol",

We all get our wings, and maybe 15 mins later she comes back and asks the first guy what kind of wings does he want for his next order, asks the second guy what he wants, asks the third guy what he wants, and then just walks away, never asked me anything, or even looked at me.",

        "text": "Over 10 years ago when I was a young-un I had to cash my check from my retail job. I went to the local [Big Bank] Branch knowing that they would charge me $5 to cash the check since I don't have an account with them but the check was issued from an account with their company. I didn't have any other option because I had recently closed my own bank account and was in the process of opening a new one. \n\n&gt; *I walk in with my driver's license, birth certificate, credit card, Costco card, student ID and my paycheck and wait my turn. Players are Me and Teller.*\n&gt;\n&gt; Me: I need to cash an employment check but don't have an account with your bank.\n&gt;\n&gt; Teller: Okay. I need two forms of ID.\n&gt;\n&gt; *I show her my driver's license and birth certificate.*\n&gt;\n&gt; Teller: I can’t accept a birth certificate as a legitimate form of identification. \n&gt;\n&gt; Me: What can you accept? \n&gt;\n&gt; Teller: Something government issued with your picture on it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Me: That’s what my driver’s license is. What about the second form? In the past tellers have used my other cards as evidence.\n&gt;\n&gt; *I begin to list off all of the documents that I have.*\n&gt;\n&gt; Me: My college student ID?\n&gt;\n&gt; Teller: Does it have your picture? *she starts sounding irritated*\n&gt;\n&gt; Me: No. But it has my name and I have to show them multiple forms of identification to get it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Teller: then I can’t accept that.\n&gt;\n&gt; Me: What about my Costco card? That has my name and picture.\n&gt;\n&gt; Teller: No, that wasn’t issued by a government agency.\n&gt;\n&gt; Me: Other credit cards? Is there anything else that can be used?\n&gt;\nMind you, up until this point I have been VERY nice and understanding. Everyone has rules and regulations that they have to adhere to and it isn’t her fault if someone broke the rules before and let me do something. But I was genuinely confused because what kind of government issued docs have both my name and picture on it. \n&gt;\n&gt; Teller: Do you have your green card? *she said with the most disdain I’ve ever heard*\n&gt;\nThis comment made me furious. Yes, I am brown and living in SoCal but I speak perfect English and have no accent whatsoever. I had my freaking birth certificate in my hand and she had the gall to assume that I was a foreigner?\n&gt;\n&gt; Me: Excuse me? I was born here. I don’t have a green card. I have a birth certificate, can I use that?\n&gt;\n&gt; Teller: No. it needs your picture. \n&gt;\n&gt; Me: So let me get this straight. You won’t accept my birth certificate or student ID because it doesn’t have my picture, but these are acceptable by the government as forms of ID. You won’t accept anything else that has my picture because it wasn’t government issued. And you can’t think of any documents that a legal citizen could provide that meets this criteria?\n&gt;\n&gt;  [Pauses while glaring at each other]\n&gt;\n&gt; Teller: I need a second government issued form of identification with your picture on it in order to cash your check.\n\nI was so furious and insulted that I just left. I realized in hindsight that I should have asked for a manager and reported her because when I went to another bank and paid $10 instead of $5 (the check didn’t originate from their company so they charged more) I was advised that a BC is a perfectly acceptable form of identification. To this day I still feel a bit of rage when I think about it. ",

        "text": "Don't mind me...just ranting.\n\nLast week our daughter turned five, and for her birthday dinner she wanted to go to the country-style restaurant with the general store in front. It was busy, so we were more than a little pleased when we were told the wait would be 15-20 minutes.\n\n~~And that's when the murders began.~~\nSorry, it's late and I'm punchy.\n\n15 minutes comes and goes. 20 minutes. 25...30...40...  Finally after 45 minutes we were seated. A good thing, because we were ready to tear into some of the candy jars by the register.\n\nNormally in a sit-down restaurant of any type you can expect your server to appear within 90 seconds. After about six 90-second intervals, our server shows up. Fortunately this was more than adequate time to have  made our dinner choices, so we ordered food and drink at the same time.\n\nTen minutes later the drinks arrive. Apparently they had to milk the cow, pick the tea leaves, and forcibly bond two hydrogen atoms with one of oxygen.\n\nTen minutes after that, with no signs that our food is in immediate danger of arriving, we request the basket of biscuits and corn muffins we were promised. This appears relatively quickly; a good thing, because the only things more irritable than hungry adults are hungry children and senior citizens, and we had all of them at the table. Its contents disappear even more quickly. \n\nAbout five minutes later the food starts to arrive. \n\nAbout five minutes after that the food is still arriving. It is almost as if they are making it one meal at a time. I know this is not true, because the \"meat and three\" I ordered was served as \"air and two\".\n\nAbout five minutes after that, when one of our party has still not been served and my \"meat and one\" is now considered missing, we insist on speaking with a manager. We regale him with our tale of misadventure and hunger, and he attempts to top us with his tale of woe and short-handedness. We win. My air and two, which has assumed room temperature at this point, is returned. The portion of our party that received their food is nearly finished. Miraculously, it is less than three minutes before our order is finally completed.\n\nOur server, sensing our understandable hostility, does not attempt to sell us on dessert. The manager, perhaps fearing we will tell his mother he is a bad boy, comps three of the seven meals. In perhaps his smartest move of the evening, all three are adult meals. \n\nFear not, dear reader! Fate has one more pothole to throw in front of us this night. For while waiting in line to pay I found the Yelp page for this humble establishment, and proceeded to thumb out my less than stellar opinion of it. By the time I reached the cashier, it had been posted, shared on Twitter, and pasted on their Facebook page as well. My hope is if I can save one child from being disappointed on his or her birthday, it will all have been worth it.",

        "text": "I had a very uncomfortable experience today whilst paying for my diesel. I think it was probably one of the worst experiences I have ever had as a customer. Worked as a waitress for years so have experienced a lot being on the other side. Anyway - rant time.\n\nI go up to the cashier and tell him my pump number. He looks outside to my car and then looks back to me with a look of disgust. \"That car is too powerful and big for a woman to be driving.\" I drive a fairly new Audi A3 and it is a company car. I was fairly taken aback by his comment and just kind of tried to laugh it off assuming this man had a shit sense of humour. \n\nBut no.. he then continues his running commentary. I told him the mileage of my car as I have a fuel card which requires this info. He then realised it was quite low so the car was not old and proclaimed \"my God and they gave you a new one too?\"  At this point I was still trying to laugh along but was quite angry. He gauged that from me and affirms \"I'm not even joking, women should be driving something smaller with the way you drive\".\n\nI felt absolutely disgusted. How dare he belittle someone he doesn't even know due to their gender?!\n\nAs I was getting my receipt he then asked - \"have I upset you now? Will you be depressed because of what I have said to you?\". At this point I rolled my eyes and left.\n\nI am by no means someone who is a crazy feminist or who gets offended easily but I was appalled at his comments whether he was \"joking\" or not. Either way he should have stopped as I became uncomfortable. It felt like an attack on everything I've worked hard for.\n\nI might make a direct complaint to the petrol station about his comments or simply to educate him on what a large vehicle actually looks like, I'm hardly driving a fucking lorry.\n\nEDIT: Update for you all, and thanks for the reaction, helps to know that this caveman is severely outnumbered in his beliefs. \n\nCalled the head office of Tesco and lodged a formal complaint. The lady on the end of the phone was absolutely appalled by the story and will be able to track down the cashier by codes given on the receipt. Both the area manager and store manager are being notified of the incident. Unfortunately it is a breach of data protection to tell us what happens next to the bastard.\n\nFor those asking why I didn't act at the time of the incident, I think I was in shock at what was being said to me. I am also quite a reserved individual and hate the idea of creating a scene, there was a large line of people behind me. I guess I need to work on my complaining skills.\n",

        "text": "My wife works for the government.  In accordance with the *Anonymizing Rule* I won't say *which* government, but it's one you've probably heard of.  Most of the time she works from home, on her government-issued laptop, using our home network, but she does go in to the office at least once a week.  When she has problems with her laptop she calls the IT department for her part of the government.  Almost inevitably the first thing they tell her is that the problem is with our home network.  It never actually is though because I've been working with computers since they used vacuum tubes, with several college degrees in things like computer science and electrical and electronic engineering.  Our home network is not bleeding edge, but it is fast, robust and secure.  When the IT department actually listens to the network specs they generally understand that this isn't the usual \"user working from home bought the cheapest possible modem and router and then configured it wrong\" type of issue they're used to dealing with and get down to actually troubleshooting the issue.\n\nLast Thursday there was an issue with the laptop that, when finally diagnosed, will require that the laptop be brought in for them to physically work on it.  The next day my wife was scheduled to be in the office was Wednesday, so that is when the repair was scheduled for.\n\nOn Friday my wife had a short day (she works 4 long days per week to get Mondays off and a half day on Friday and still do 40 hours) and we went out car shopping in the afternoon. While we were out IT called the house and left a message, wanting to know where the laptop was and why she hadn't brought it in.  (which lead to the voicemail from the house phone being relayed to my cell phone and my cell phone playing it through my GPS, which was kinda fun)  My wife called them back on her government phone which, not being our home number, totally befuddled the tech but eventually she got through to him/her that the laptop would be brought in on Wednesday.\n\nSaturday afternoon IT called (who knew they even worked Saturdays?), wanting to know where the laptop was and why it hadn't been brought in yet.  Again, it was explained that it would be brought in Wednesday.  Not Saturday, not Sunday, not Monday, not Tuesday.  WEDNESDAY.\n\nThis morning (Monday), at 08:05, IT called and woke us up, wanting to know where the laptop was and why it hadn't been brought in yet.  My wife is a patient and gentle woman, but I am very glad our gun safe takes time to get open and that the tech was 60 miles away.  It was once again explained to them that the laptop would be brought in on Wednesday.\n\nI figure three more calls (this afternoon and then morning and afternoon tomorrow) and we'll be done with this madness, but I'm wondering if I should start looking for a bail bonds place near where IT is located and if it actually *is* possible to insert a full sized laptop in someone's rectum.",

        "text": "This is fairly fresh as it happened yesterday when I was trying to rent a car from a place we will just refer to as Mertz.\n\nMy boyfriend and I decided to take a vacation to Miami for a week because we're both insane workaholics who very rarely get time off. I had made reservations with another car rental place (Not Mertz) before we got here that had cost about $500 that had already been taken out of my bank account, and when we arrived to pick up our car, they tried to charge us an additional $400 in hidden fees so I told them to keep their car and we would take our business somewhere that wasn't going to rip us off (we were only renting for 5 days).\n\nCue the reservation I chose to make with Mertz that night. Some background would be that I don't have a credit card and didn't plan to open one just for this trip (though after this, I'm definitely going to open one when I get home specifically for traveling), and my boyfriend only uses debit as well. One of the stipulations for renting with a debit card is that they do not do same-day rentals unless you are using credit. We are also both 21, so a little young to rent a car, but we needed to be able to get around all week without totally relying on Ubers.\n\nSo I made my reservation for yesterday at 11am, and arrived about a half hour early because I was renting through the airport which is typically very busy so I wanted to give myself time to make it through the line. While in line, two guys nearby who were being assisted at the counter were in an all out screaming match, threatening each other and this went on for about 20-30 minutes without anybody doing anything. I thought the counter should have called security because there were children nearby, and the situation only seemed to be escalating. The other customers around me seemed to be very concerned too, asking why staff was not calling some kind of backup. Finally, someone had the bright idea that maybe the situation was becoming a little unsafe and called security to come stand with the guys until they were through the line. This should have happened much sooner I thought, but hey I was just happy it was taken care of.\n\nSo we are still waiting in line, and it is taking FOREVER. Like we waited for about 50 minutes in line before we got to speak to somebody. This is the least of my concerns because I know it's incredibly busy so I was trying to be very patient. I bartend so I know what it's like to be working under pressure with high volumes of people, and I always try to be understanding of the stress staff must be under.\n\nSo finally we get up to the counter, and the lady starts off by asking my confirmation number. I have never rented a car on my own before, and I was totally naive to the fact that I needed one. I told the lady helping us that I didn't have a confirmation number and that they had never even asked for my email. I ask if she can look us up by name, and she is very short and dismissive but agrees to try. Looks up both of our names, not in the system. I calmly explain that there must be some kind of mistake because I most certainly made a reservation the day before in order to be able to rent with my debit card. She said,\"There is no possible way that you made a reservation if you don't have a confirmation number and you're not in our system.\" That paired with the condescending way she was talking to us, as if we were wasting her precious time, made me feel like I was being accused of lying about my reservation that I had just waited in line for an hour for.\n\nI insist that we did in fact make a reservation, and she says to call the toll free number then because she's not dealing with it. I agree to call the number, and I say that I know this is a misunderstanding and not her fault, but that it is very frustrating. I'm emphasizing this because I was trying to be beyond understanding because I knew we weren't going to receive any help if we were being rude or difficult. I also wanted to make sure that if she chose to keep treating customers like this, that we would totally be in the right.\n\nI call the toll free number while at the counter to try to sort this out. The entire time I was on the phone with the customer service hotline, the lady was trying to talk over me, saying over and over again \"You do not have reservations!! You need to make one today, and just come back tomorrow!! You need to make a new reservation, this is a waste of time!\" Over and over again. So I tell her no way, and I'll figure this out if she won't help me and tell my boyfriend to deal with her because I cannot hear the man on the phone.  The man was extremely patient and understanding on the phone, and he was actually able to locate our reservation in about 5 minutes as opposed to the 15 we had already spent trying to get her to work with us. What had happened was that they had accidentally put a \"B\" in place of the \"V\" in my boyfriend's name.\n\nShe was obviously feeling a little salty about the fact that we did indeed have reservations, and this seemed to make her attitude even more sour. She says,\"You DO know you will have to pay our $28/day underage fee right?! You know we check your credit, right?!\" And other things insinuating that it was going to be an expensive purchase and maybe we wouldn't have the money for it. She then points the other direction and tells us to go on other 20 minute wait. By then we have been there for over 1.5 hours.\n\nOver the \"20 minute\" wait (in reality, it was 45 minutes), i took matters into my own hands because I was so appalled by the entire situation. I used my voice to totally trash the company online because I know that that is the quickest way to get assistance because they don't want that reflecting on their image. Within 5 minutes, corporate contacted me asking about the situation and I told them EVERYTHING. I sent them a video of the situation because there were just customers all around who were sick of it too who were trying to get ahold of corporate to complain.\n\n Corporate seemed to be understanding, and I'm 90% sure they contacted the location ASAP because they called us back to the counter and were just trying to get us out of there. The lady was significantly more polite, though very stiff about it lol but I was much happier to deal with someone who wasn't being rude every other sentence. She kept shouting to her coworkers across the counter saying,\"Somebody come get this boy a car! This boy needs keys immediately so they can get out of here!\" Never once apologized. I don't know if it was due to us contacting corporate or if they were out of compact cars, but they gave us a nicer one than we signed up for. I was just happy to be out of there.\n\nI felt like I had been failed by whoever set up our reservation to begin with for not asking my email for a confirmation number (and also for GUARANTEEING me my rate over the phone, but when I got there it was $70 more than expected but I didn't have the energy to argue with them about it anymore) and failed at the counter. I appreciated corporate trying to help get us out of there and apologizing, but that doesn't make up for the over 3 hours we spent there and the treatment we received. I rented the car through them because I needed to, but I will never ever return. Frankly, I'm still upset that they got even a single cent of my money.",

Don't be disheartened if it's wrong. No one ever gets it right. Ever. Like it's super rare. \n\nShe uses the machine thing and two colours pop up: Ivory and Sand\nI'm looking pretty smug because I've just proved her wrong in front of customers. \n\nSA: Well. Erm. Yes. It looks like you (said in a bit of a sarcastic tone) were right. \n\nShe looked like is just spat on her mothers face. \n\nM: Anyway, I think we should go with Sand because she will be tanned in the summer and it'll blend better. \n\nObviously my sister listens to me as I probably have slightly more make-up history than this woman does. \n\nI felt kind of bad for making her look bad in front of customers, but in hindsight she shouldn't have been so snotty with me when I told her I knew what I was talking about. \n\nMoral of this story: don't judge that girl who looks 14 and has no make-up on. She may surprise you with her knowledge haha. \n",

Had a scheduled color appt with my regular girl for April 22nd.  I work retail and we had a last minute schedule change, so I called on the day before April 21st to reschedule.  We are set for May 5th.  I even went to some effort to rework part of my schedule to make it fit.\n\nWithin the hour I called to reschedule, I got a few missed calls from the same unsaved number (retail, no phones on the floor, you know how it goes).  Call back, was dentist office confirmation, then I go about my day.\n\nFast forward to today, May 5th.  I arrive at the salon on time and check in.  R is receptionist, M is me.\n\nR:  I am so sorry, I don't see anything here.\n\nM:  Well, I called on April 21st to reschedule my original appointment.  We rescheduled for today, 10AM.  \n\nR:  I see a cancellation.\n\nM:  Why?  I never authorized that.\n\nR:  Let me try to find out more.\n\nShe heads to the back while I am growing agitated and 2 more customers enter.  I kindly explained to them that reception was addressing an issue with my appointment and they would be right back.\n\nI get an idea and decide to check my voicemail.  Lo and behold, the same day I called to reschedule, the salon left a message stating they accidentally double-booked and to call them to reschedule again.  The missed salon calls had gotten shoved down the queue that day due to more missed calls.  After that, there was no follow up.  \n\nSo, I explained what happened and that it was my fault for failing to check my messages properly, but that they had failed by not communicating with their stylists efficiently.  Otherwise, the double-booking would have never happened to begin with.\n\nR:  I am sorry.  If you have time today...\n\nM:  I don't.  I work in a few hours.  \n\nR:  Oh okay, would you like to reschedule now?\n\nM:  My schedule is tight.  I will just call you guys when I am ready.\n\nAfter that I turned and left.  I kept it short and I certainly let her know with my tone how frustrated I was, but I wanted to get away before I said something I couldn't take back.\n\nI feel as though this situation warranted a bit more follow up from the salon's end.  Perhaps another scheduled call or another method of contact.  But I failed too.  I was really looking forward to that appointment cause it is so rare when I get to treat myself, y'know?  A balayage isn't cheap!",

Please contact support\". \n\nAfter trying the obvious (restarting, redownloading app, etc.) i did what was requested and contacted the support.\n\nBefore getting to someone i had to explain my problem in a contact formular. After waiting for 10 mins i get called by the \"Support\".\n\nAfter saying hi and reexplaining my problem, kind of in an intro way to the conversation i get interrupted:\n\nS: \"Alright let me just check for a solution\".\n\nAnd more waiting... i would have guessed that the reason i have to explain my problem in advance would be so that the support can educate themselves beforehand about whatever problem i am having.\n\nS: \"Hi. Alright. May i have your e-mail-adress please?\"\n\nAnother thing i put into the contact form, but ok. After spelling my e-mail out and getting it spelled back to me, she excuses herself again: \n\nS: \"I will look into your account now\"\n\nAt this point i don't even care. I just wanna get over this.\n\nS: Yes, alright. If you go to brandname.support.com you can check if anyone else has had the same problem.\n\nAt this point i was waiting for her to continue with any actual idea of what to do or further directions.\n\n*SILENCE*\n\nMe: Ehm, hello?\n\nS: Yes, i am still here.\n\n*MORE SILENCE*\n\nS: Is there anything else i can assist you with?\n\nAt this point i just couldn't believe it, but i just had enough. It seemed like this would be all they would do for me.\n\nMe: So that's it? Your best help is to \"google the problem\"? I have already done that and found nothing, that's why i am calling.\n\nTo be honest i don't even remember the answer it was some weird form of excuse while basicly saying that yes, that was all she could do for me. I was just baffled that this billion dollar company had this kind of customer support.\n\nSo here is my story of how 25 minutes of waiting got me the helpful direction to \"Google the problem\". Is that really what \"Support\" means?",

I was being served by the cashier who was the only one on the shop floor of this big brand's convenience store. This was last summer.\n\nSo the customer was actually behind myself and my mum in the queue. There's a couple of self checkouts but my mum wanted scratch cards and some cigs so we went to the cashier. I'll be me, cashier will be c, my mum will be mum and customer will be b for bitch.\n\nB: oh so you're doing a weekly shop here? Don't you see its an express store?\n\nMum: where does it say we can't do a weekly shop here? \n\nMe: yeah, and we've not got loads anyway just things we need over the weekend. \n\nB: fine, I guess I'll go self service then!\n\nAfter a minute or so, I hear the message saying a staff member is needed because of alcohol. So ofc this riles her up. \n\nB: can you get over here and sort this bloody thing out?\n\nMe: can you leave the poor girl alone? She's seeing to a customer, don't be rude for God's sake.\n\nB: well now I'm late for picking my kid up from school because of her!\n\nMe: she didn't decide you should go shopping near the school pickup time. You could leave right now and be on time but clearly you want your wine more.\n\nB: what's it any of your business?\n\nMe: well you just told me, so you made it my business.\n\nMum: yeah, you can't tell somebody something and get mad at them about it. \n\nThen the manager appears and asks the cashier what's wrong.\n\nC: this lady needs assistance and she would like to log a complaint I think.\n\nB: no I don't have bloody time to make a complaint because you've made me late to pick my kid up. \n\nThe manager gives that wide eyed look that you give each other when a customer is rude. After the customer goes we were talking to the manager and cashier. I praised the cashier so much for the composure and both the manager and cashier thanked me for taking her on.\n\nI'm a confrontational person in these scenarios but I can't be when I'm at work. Normally I would try and let staff diffuse the situation but this day I was not having it at all. I didn't think I'd have another story for you guys but I remembered one.",

        "text": "I've been meaning to post this for awhile, etc. But hey good formatting not from mobile! Yadda yadda ya. First time posting here.\n\nDue to a booking error on my Spring Break this year I had to switch my hostel reservations for the night. Okay, not a big deal. My boyfriend and I found a new hostel and the fun began.\n\nIt is worth noting that this was the third to last day of our vacation and I had been sick for the last four. I was exhausted and probably cranky anyway. \n\n11:00pm- We check in for the night. All is good. Really great guy at the front desk. We go free breakfast in the morning. They gave us ear plugs. I'm happy.\n\nWe shower and wind down for the night. We booked a six person room for the night. That was the smallest we'd stayed in thus far in hostels. Overall, the hostels weren't bad for the most part. As you can guess this is going to change.\n\n1:00am- We head to bed. I fall asleep pretty quickly (see aforementioned sickness). My BF on the other hand does not. \n\n2:00am- Our drunk roommate comes in. With an extra night time guest. (This part of the story is obviously second hand since I'm sleeping). They climb up to the TOP BUNK and start getting busy. I would like to mention the beds did have curtains, a small victory. \n\nNow this room has three bunk beds in it and no standing room. We are the furthest from them and probably only ten feet away. Now they're giggling and talking about how hard her pants are to get off. My BF at this point makes it clear people are still awake in the room. He shifts in his bed, coughs, moves the curtain around, and texts some people.\n \nNot stopping, my BF can hear her sucking him off. Needless to say he could hear everything and didn't fall asleep until long after they finished. \n\n8:30am- We wake up and walk downstairs to breakfast. I'm getting the replay of last night as we look for bowls and mugs to eat breakfast with. There are plates, but nothing else. We wait around, looking for someone to ask. \nAfter not seeing anyone restocking we wonder upstairs in search of bowls. Maybe they give them out at the front desk to make sure people pay for breakfast? We wait in line for a few minutes, and ask about breakfast dishes. The girl is a little puzzled and told us they should be there. \n\nWe go back down. Wait around a bit more. No sign of staff. It's also worth noting I have medicine that I have to take with food in the morning. If I don't take it pretty quick I feel like shit. So I give up and make my cereal in a glass. \n\nMy BF decides to wait around for a bit longer, because he also needs a mug for tea. I make my cereal, sit down, start eating, when I hear my BF say, \"Excuse me, could I get a bowl and mug?\" He thanks him when they are brought out, makes his food, and sits down with me. I'm pretty much done with my cereal at this point. \nThen the staff member who brought this dishes out comes to our table. He very loudly states, \"It's the morning and you need to chill out,\" and walks away. \n\nMy BF and I kinda just stare at each other. He then questions me if he had done something rude, since I overheard the conversation. I assure him that the guy had no reason to complain. \n\nI excuse myself to go to the bathroom. Like most hostels the bathrooms aren't attached to the room. I duck into one on the main level right by the stairs to breakfast. \n\nAnyway, I close the stall. The lock falls off the second I let go. I don't think much of it. There's no one in there. If someone comes in, I can hold the door closed.\n\nI do my business. The toilet doesn't flush. After a few attempts, I give up and try to leave the stall. It's locked. Weird, I didn't even realize it locked.\n\nNow I should mention this story takes place in England. For those of you not familiar with British toilets, there aren't any gaps. It's pretty much a closet.\n\nI pick up the piece of the lock that fell off and insert it back into the hole. Nothing happens. I get down and look at the lock. It's two pieces. One is in my hand. The other is the rod that moves the actual lock, and it is hanging out the other side. The hole is the size of my pinky. After a few moments of tinkering, I conclude I can't pull the rod back through. I push it out of the hole and hope something happens. It doesn't. \n\nAlright, this isn't a big deal. It's breakfast time, I'm on the main floor, a ton of people are walking by. I start hollering and banging on the door. All the while I'm tinkering with the door, trying anything and everything to get it to open. \n\nSome amount of time later- it's clear I can't open the door. All I have for tools is the room key and a tube of chapstick. I already tried jimmying the lock like they do in movies with credit cards, not the right kind of door. I tried undoing the screws with the edge of the card. No luck.\n\nNow I'm upset. I'm sick, tired, and locked in a stall with my own shit. The worst part? I know people can hear me and are walking by. It's nearing the last time for check out, the hallway is getting plenty of traffic. At this point the water works start. I'm frustrated. \n\nMore time goes by. I'm crying, screaming, banging. Nothing. No one. \n\nEventually some lovely man cracks the door open with a \"Hello?\"\n\n\nMe: Hello?!\n\nMan: Are you okay?\n\nMe: No the lock on the stall door broke?\n\nMan: Broke?\n\nMe: Yes, there's piece on the floor. I have the other one.\n\n\nHe picks it up and puts it in. Click. I burst out of the stall tear stained and kinda hyperventilating. \n\nMan: Are yo okay?\n\nMe: What time is it?\n\nMan: 9:40\n\nMe: I've been in there almost half an hour. \n\nMan: OH my gosh. Are you sure you're okay?\n\nMe: Yes, I'm fine. Just shaken. \n\nMan: I was walking by and could hear the banging and I thought someone was having really loud sex. Until I heard \nyou yelling. I thought for sure you were being raped. \n\nI assured him I was fine and went back to my room. My BF opened the door a moment before I got there. He sees me, sees tears, and freaks out. He said he was about to come looking for me and asks me what happened. \nWe step into a bathroom (without stall) (they also couldn't even both stand in there, so we're in the doorway and I'm bawling still. \n\nAt this point a girl comes around the corner, sees a crying girl and asks if everything is okay. My BF assures her it's fine. She asks again, this time directed at me. I assured her it's fine. (Thanks for looking out for me though)\nAnyway, we are now late to check out. I'm still crying in the room, while my roommates one night stand peers out from the curtain at me. My BF tells the front desk that we'll be a little late checking out, but doesn't mention anything that happened. \n\nI finally get packed up. I'm still shaking, but I finally composed myself enough to leave. My BF and I decided we were asking for a refund at check out. I let my BF do the talking. When he brings up the bathroom I start crying. I tell them which stall it was so they can make sure it's fixed and they give the refund. \n\nThis wouldn't have been so bad we hadn't only been in the hostel for ten hours. Also, I had just a day or so before remarked to my BF that Europe had started making me feel kind of claustrophobic. (Crowded trains, buses, streets, starting making me uncomfortable and nervous). Pretty sure I'm claustrophobic now. ",

        "text": "Just found this sub, and I remembered a story I think you guys will like.\n\nEver since I was a teen, she had me on a joint-account for our phone bill. We just kept it that way. My upgrade was due, and hers was just a few weeks after. We've always pulled a fast one and told them we're wanting to leave the company, and always done it over the phone as we've ended up with much better deals than in person.\n\nSo I researched the current market of phones to find the one I'd like. I took the details of the one my mum would like, and they matched the S6 and were in our price range. I liked what I saw from research, so my mum went along to phone them.\n\nI started cooking dinner whilst she went to ring them, and I went to the toilet in between. The bathroom door is next to her bedroom (bungalow if you're confused) and then I heard **\"NO. I keep telling you, I cannot afford that price a month!\"** as I'm going in, and I heard it another 3 times during my pee, and so after I went to go find out what was going on.\n\nMy mum says she won't listen to her, but the woman keeps insisting she has and my mum just needs to listen carefully (didn't sound so patronizing tho) and I told my mum to let me listen. She said to us *\"Samsung S6 32 GB, unlimited texts and calls, 10 GB data for the same price of X\"* which matches our needs perfectly.\n\nOnce she said this, I couldn't help but smile because I instantly realised what was going through my mum's head at the time. She was looking at the company's website which was showing 15 GB data to be out of her price range. So as the woman said \"S6 32 GB\" my mum thought she was saying with 32 GB of data - because her last phone, an Xperia M2 had a micro SD...so she's clueless with the concept of internal storage at this point.\n\nIf it wasn't for me wanting an iPod touch all them years ago, then I probably would have been clueless as well. When the woman was going through the T's&amp;C's I told my mum to apologise to this woman.\n\nWhat this lady says next will SHOCK you (couldn't resist, sry) *\"Oh, don't apologise mam, you didn't do anything wrong.\"* The most I've seen her apologise was after she slapped me as a teen for being very rude to her, and that was nothing in comparison for how much she was apologising to the lady.\n\nIf I were her, I would've just said \"it's okay\" and cussed her out afterwards. But she's telling my mum it's okay for her shouting at her and not listening? That woman deserves a bloody promotion.\n\nWe've never done one of those surveys the call centres send out before, but we both filled out this one and tried to praise her as much as possible.\n\nI doubt I'll ever have anything else to post here, as I hate any type of shopping with a passion and avoid it at all costs -5 but this is just as fun as /r/TalesFromRetail so I'll be staying around.",

        "text": "This weekend was one of the first nice weekends of the year in our area, so my partner and I headed out to the nearby home improvement store to get a few gardening items. It was (as expected) a busy day at the store, but they had plenty of staff working so lines weren't more than three or four people deep. We looked around, grabbed a few items, and hopped in line in the outside nursery part of the store. \n\nOnce we got to the front, the cashier was a bit brusque, but I figured he just wanted to keep people moving due to the busy day. No problem. About halfway through our transaction, I realized that the cashier's hand was bleeding. Not just like a hangnail, tiny bit of blood, but a pretty significant gash. His entire right hand was covered in blood that was starting to drip onto the floor. \n\nMe: Oh my God, you're bleeding. Are you okay? \n\nHim: Huh? Oh, yeah. It's okay. \n\nHe proceeded to grab a paper towel and halfway wrap it around his hand, mopping up a tiny bit of the blood. I again asked him if he was okay and if he needed some help, and he brushed it off. Before I could say anything, he stacked the planters I had purchased and handed them to me. There was a huge smear of blood on the outside planter (thank God they were light in color, so the blood was really obvious). He then started to move toward the next customer in line.\n\nMe: Um, excuse me, but there's quite a bit of blood on this planter. \n\nHim: Oh. Okay. \n\nHe proceeded to grab another paper towel and, *with his bloody hand*, try to scrub off the blood. He did this for approximately 15 seconds while my partner, myself, and the next person in line just stared at him. He then handed it back to me, with a bloodstain still obviously present. \n\nMe: ...Is it okay if I just get a new one?\n\nHim: Oh. Okay.\n\nI went back and got a new one and left, but was so disgusted and surprised. Isn't that a biohazard? It was just so bizarre and he acted so nonchalant about what looked like a pretty significant injury?",

When I was about to leave, I checked my receipt and noticed I had been charged twice for the single blanket.  No big deal, things happen.  I walked over to customer service so I could get the money back before I left.\n\nThere was no line, but because I'm generally a polite person and the people behind the counter looked busy, I waited by the little sign until one of them called me forward.  After less than 30 seconds, the woman on the far left gestured to me and asked if she could help me, and I started walking toward the counter.\n\nCue the customer on the bench to the side FREAKING THE FUCK OUT.\n\nI'd only taken maybe two steps forward when she stood up and physically blocked my pathl, angrily shouting about how no one should be helping anyone else until she had been refunded for the vacuum that she had purchased online that \"came broken.\"  Both of the employees behind the customer service counter tried to explain that the man on the right was actively on hold the support center or whoever needed to be contacted for her refund to happen, and that there was nothing to be done just then but wait for someone to take the call on the other end.\n\nBut the disgruntled customer would not be placated.  She kept going on and on about how it was terrible customer service for one of them to help me when she had not been helped.\n\nThe woman behind the counter kept glancing at me with worry, and I did my best to come up with a facial expression that conveyed 'it's okay, I don't mind waiting, clearly this lady is crazy and I'm not going to complain about you to your boss because of her.'\n\nShe looks mildly reassured and goes to check the woman's order history on the computer, and that's when I find out why the customer it's having so much trouble getting her refund: According to the file, *she had already been refunded*, but she was absolutely sure that this was impossible because she (supposedly) didn't have the money.\n\nAround this point, the other employee was taken off hold and after about ten seconds (during which he was asked what the person on the other end of the line was saying no less than three times), he turned on the speakerphone in order to include the irate customer in the conversation.  This meant she was moderately distracted, but still facing in the direction of the other employee behind the counter.\n\nHere is where I feel like I should mention that I am 5'1\" and approximately 120 lb, and the crazy lady was at least 5'9\" and looked like she worked out.  And she was also, you know, crazy.  Not to mention that third store isn't exactly in the best part of town and people have been known to be murdered in the parking lot.  I was frankly afraid to walk out in front of the crazy lady in order to approach the counter, considering how angry she had been the last time I had tried.  And the customer service employee looked like she was still doing something relevant to her as well, and wasn't calling me up again.  So I kept waiting.\n\nBut then the wonderful customer service woman picked up her scanner and walked around the counter to approach me where I was waiting and asked me what she could help me with.  I explained the blanket situation and she asked if I wanted my refund on cash.  I said yes and took my receipt and walked back to her station and did the majority of the transaction before calling me forward to reclaim my money and receipt, minimizing the amount of time I'd be in the crazy lady's crosshairs.  As soon as I'd finished, I thanked her and got the hell out of there.\n\nSo, here's to you, customer service woman with more patience than anyone should actually need to have.  You did an awesome job, and I hope the crazy lady didn't put your job in jeopardy.",

I then attempted to use another video watching program which I will refer to as N, but sadly to no avail, it would not show up as a device to stream to. I attempted a few solutions and got stuck. I then called N Support, thinking it was an issue with the app.\n\nI was put on a waiting queue, and surprisingly I was put on the line within 10 seconds with a man I will call D. I gave him my account credentials to N's service, and we began working on fixing the problem. We attempted many solutions to fix the problem, from resetting the C to resetting N. We were at a loss, and through what was about a 20 minute call, D remained calm, polite, and what a model tech support person should be. He said I should go talk to C's manufacturer, who may or may not also own Y. They will be referred to as G\n\nI called G, and since this was a big company, I expected minimum wage, lifeless robots who could barely speak English. I expected to have to wait in a queue for hours, as I was thinking those thoughts I was connected to lovely young fellow named E. He was of a different nationality, but he spoke English clearly and I understood him well. \n\nI told him of the previous troubleshooting techniques I had used, and with that knowledge, E and I set off on an adventure! We reset my router, rebooted N, Y, and C and still we had no fix. He suggested that I attempted to install another program that supports streaming, and I met my mortal enemy, the password. \n\nI didn't know the password to download apps. This may or may not have been due to spending issues involving a certain game and in app purchases. Nonetheless, I normally don't have this issue, because I can download free apps using my fingerprint. Unfortunately it was hot and I was sweaty, and the fingerprint scanner didn't work. \n\nWe had hit a brick wall. We had nothing else to do. And again I was very impressed with how E handled the whole situation, patiently explaining the next step after step. I bid him farewell and gave him my phone # for him to call me back at my next available hour, which will be this Tuesday. \n\nOh, and did I mention, I gave them both perfect ratings on the surveys after both calls. They were that awesome and I hope that gets them promoted.\n\nTL;DR: I had an issue, and two different tech support agents from two different companies and continents, were amazing.\n\nI still haven't had my issue resolved, but I'm happy right now so I don't care.",

I ask one employee where the aisle is at that contains light bulbs so I can begin my hunt. Easy enough. \n\nRealizing that I don't know shit, and that there are about 700 or more to see, (I'll be a Pokemon master it's my destiny) light bulbs in this massive aisle, I press the buzzer to enlist an employee to assist me with my hunt. \n\nCue, dude, maybe 42 sauntering over, and greeting me with a sarcastic, \"What can I help you with SIR.\" I ignore his sarcasm and ask him to help me locate this H1N1LGBTBBQ+ Specialty lightbulb, and with a huff he states that I'm in the right aisle and immediately darts away. I stop him and ask if he might know where it is at, and he, again, huffs stating in this aisle. I ask if there's some rhyme or reason to this pocket monster sized aisle, so that maybe I can locate this bulb (before I'm as old as he is) and he sharply inhales before telling me that it's sorted by category and to look at section 7 of the 39r82ie829183848 sections in the aisle. \n\nI run over to take a look, ensuring he'd by my side with no luck. Finally, I ask if there's someone else who might be more familiar with this aisle, and he chuckles and pulls out his walkey and states, condescendingly, \"I've got a VERY lost gentlemen who can't find a light bulb. Who wants to join in on the fun?\" I ignore this, just wanting my light bulb. \n\nAsshole #2 arrives, and they spend the next 10 minutes not looking at anything on the shelf, sarcastically moaning, \"Where could it be? Oh my, oh me, where is this lightbulb?\" \n\nAt this point I was a bit more than annoyed, and just let loose. I tore into both of them about being arrogant, rude, and sarcastic pieces of shit who I understood why they were 40+ still working as low-level employees because they weren't capable of doing their fucking jobs without insulting someone who just wants to give them money. I walk off, stating I'm going to talk to a manager and seek out a way to contact corporate, and suddenly they're both looking for my bulb in the aisle and find it within 45 seconds, behind another set of bulbs in their ridiculous sorting system. I grab it without and leave. \n\nReported both of them to corproate and got an email about 3 weeks later thankimg me for my feedback, and that one of the two had receiced disciplanary action for the incident.\n\nI get it, retail blows, but if you just shit on everyone who walk through the door, you're setting yourself up for failure.",

        "text": "I'm an avid DIYer and amateur wood-worker. I still have a LOT to learn, but I know more than the average joe, mostly because I do tons of research before tackling a project. I'll be putting up crown molding and want to practice coping before I do so. \n\nFor those that don't know: [coping crown molding](http://s3.amazonaws.com/finehomebuilding.s3.tauntoncloud.com/app/uploads/2016/04/09224741/MIM-coping-crown_feat_rotator-thumb2.jpg) is to take a very thin saw and cut the exact shape of the molding so that you can push it against another piece with no gaps. This is better than a 45˚ cut, because if your walls aren't exactly 90˚, there will be a gap. Since we're doing stain-grade molding (can't just fill it with caulk), I need to learn how to cope. \n\nI had done my research on how to cope, but not on which tools specifically I needed. I went into the local WoodWorking Store and asked for a coping saw and coping blades. The guy hands me two things that look right, so I head home. \n\nThe stupid blades kept falling out or snapping off of the stupid saw. I broke several blades and hours of frustration (\"maybe I just need more relief cuts?\" SPROING) before giving up. I went back to the drawing board, watching more videos, reading more articles...trying to figure out what I was doing wrong. \"It doesn't look that hard! I'm pretty handy! Why isn't this darn saw just working??\"\n\nI finally stumbled upon an article that talked about the different kinds of coping saws. I realized that the part that holds the blade on looked nothing like the saw that I had. I went to the basement to check.... He had sold me something called a PIERCING saw and a package of SCROLLSAW blades. *Doh* No wonder they kept breaking and falling out. \n\n((( Now, let me explain why this is a big deal. The [piercing saw that I was sold](https://www.amazon.com/Unknown-PS51-Eclipse-Piercing-Saw-x/dp/B0043YJ0HI) has a small hand-crank screw with a washer/nut on the end of it. Presumably, you put a blade between the frame and the washer and hand-crank it to hold the blade in place from the pressure. First of all, since the blade is *sandwiched*, there is no way to get any tension in the blade. It's flimsy and wobbles back and forth. There is also no way to get the hand-crank screw tight enough so that the blade will not *fall out* while sawing. I used my pliers to crank it as tight as possible, and after a few seconds of sawing, the blade falls out. It's just *NOT* made for that! A [*coping* saw](https://www.amazon.com/Eclipse-70-CP1R-Handle-Coping-Thickness/dp/B002NH0EC2/ref=pd_cp_469_1) on the other hand, along with *coping* blades have little metal nubs so, not only do they lock in place, but they also provide great tension. )))\n\nI called the store last night and talked to a nice gentleman who says they will take care of me. Tonight, I went back with my used and broken tools explaining how they had sold me the wrong thing and now that I've done my research, I know what to buy. He says that they will take care of it, if I just want to pick out what I need. I needed his help finding them, so he leads me over to the coping section. \n\n\nHe says \"So what do you need a coping saw for?\" \n\nI said \"I'm coping some crown molding\". \n\nHim: \"Oh ok, so, are you doing straight cuts?\" \n\nMe: \"...........No, I'm using my chop saw to cut the angle and then coping it\". \n\nHim: \"So how are you cutting it?\" (or some random dumbass similar question) \n\nLooooooooong silence where I'm looking at him trying to figure out how to respond. \n\nMe: \".....Do....you know what coping is?\" \n\nHim: \"Yeah, it's where you cut out the shape of a profile\"\n\nMe: \"....Ok....that's what I'm doing\"\n\n\nI pick up the only coping saw on the rack. Hanging on the peg next to it is the piercing saw I just returned. \n\nI casually remarked \"This is the one that the other person told me to get, even though I asked for a coping saw\" \n\nHe says \"Yeah, that's what I'd recommend because you can get tighter turns.\" \n\nI'm just aghast. I can't believe that after I just explained how much turmoil and trouble I had trying to get the WRONG SAW and the WRONG BLADES to work he would say that it is still his recommendation....(I now believe he's the guy I talked to originally)\n\nI just grabbed the coping blades (also next to the coping saw, not on another aisle like the scrollsaw blades were), checked out and left. \n\nI just can't believe that a WOODWORKING STORE....not a Big Box Store....not a Department Store....a *woodworking store* would suggest a piercing saw and scroll saw blades when they were specifically asked for a coping saw. Beyond that, that they say it is their *recommendation*! These are supposed to be the experts!\n\nMoral of the story: always always do your research and don't rely on others to have the expertise for you, no matter how simple of a question it might be or how \"expert\" the people are supposed to be.\n\nP.s. I will still shop there, only because they did actually \"make it right\". But I really had to vent about this experience.",

First I posted on FB a request for stories from others about the staff at the steakhouse. Second,  I went online and looked at reviews.   I screenshot what I couldn't pull up on my phone.   I armed myself with these and drove out to the restaurant. \n\nI went in on Tuesday of last week.   They were open at 16:00 so I went in as they opened.  The same waitress was there and the woman behind the counter.   I asked to speak with the owner and woman said she was the owner.   I never do this,  but I asked to speak with her husband.  I know from previous visits,  there used to be a husband...\n\nThe woman burst into tears and said it was just her now.   She was carrying on like he died that morning and I felt like an ass.  I tried to sympathize and I asked her how long he'd been gone,  thinking maybe she just needed an ear.   NOPE! She got angry with me!  Told me to get the eff out of her restaurant and don't come back...\n\nI was stunned into silence so I backed out the door slowly.   I don't know what her problem was,  I don't know if she's crazy or what but I won't be going back there ever.   I never got to talk with her,  discuss anything and she went batcrap crazy. \n\nSo I was talking to my friend who rents a store from the owner of the building the steakhouse is in.   She told me the guy didn't die... he left that woman after 53 years of marriage and went to Florida a year ago.

My boyfriend was uncomfortable in the shoes he had on, and asked if we could stop by the [huge athletic shoe] store on the way home. I figured they wouldn't be dog friendly, I wouldn't begrudge them if they weren't, so I planned on sitting in the car with the puppy while he shopped. \n\nWhen boyfriend went in, he asked at the register if the store was dog-friendly, guy said sure man! No problem. Great, I gathered up the kid and followed him in. We must have shopped for 25 minutes with her, she's not misbehaving or causing a problem, the employees are being kind and welcoming and petting her. \n\nAs we're getting ready to check out, a chubby dude with a headset comes out of a back office and approaches us. \"We are NOT dog friendly here. You need to get your dog out.\" I was a little shocked at his aggression and said back, \"sure man, but we DID ask before she came in and we were told it was fine. But ok.\" and I left very quickly. Boyfriend finished his purchase and met me back in the car. \n\nThis happened two weeks ago and I'm still irritated about it. He missed an opportunity to apologize for THEIR mistake, if he had said \"sorry, there must have been a misunderstanding, we aren't dog friendly\" it wouldn't have been an issue. I would have excused myself and left. But he instead made me feel like a selfish criminal, DARING to bring a well-behaved puppy inside. \n\nThey need to get their policy straight and get all their employees on the same page so they don't run paying customers out again. It's a small annoyance, but it's enough where I won't shop there anymore, dog or not. \n\n",

        "text": "Happened about 7 months ago. There's more context than actual story, but whatever, here we go. \n\nMy wife has a glass travel cup from a big coffee chain that recently put out some colorful  frapa bullshit drink. Our kids were just born and in the NICU. We just transferred hospitals and we were super stressed out. She was trying to pump, and knocked over her cup and it shattered everywhere. She was devastated.  She needed to drink alot of water during pregnancy and now after for her milk supply. This was her cup. There were many like it, but this one was hers. She was devastated. I tell her im going to get a new one. \n\nSo off i go. I find a nearby place. I'm me, coffee guy is CG.\n\nMe: (immediately find cup and place on counter, and clearly frazzled.) Hey hows it goin.\n\nCG: is that gonna be all?\n\nMe: yea, wife just broke hers. She'd really like another one. ( casually mention just having twins and our hospital situation.)\n\nCG: congrats, best of luck to you guys. (Rings me up for the cup at like half price)\n\nMe: you serious? Thanks man. \n\n\nAnd then im on my way back to the hospital. It was nice to catch a break. Coffee guy didn't have to do that. \n\nI always enjoy reading the negative stories on these pages, and here i go posting a positive one. Thanks again, coffee guy.",

        "text": "TL;DR: Delivery drivers don't follow directions, complaints to head office don't get anywhere. Finally stiff driver to get the lesson across. Driver learns lesson and teaches others. Driver gets 30% tip afterward.\n\nMy husband and I share a bungalow-style house with our 90+ year old landlady.  We occupy a fully-outfitted basement suite and our primary entrance is on the side of the building.  The front door is only accessible by our landlady. Our landlady is has been the victim of a home invasion in the past and is very nervous about strangers, so when we have food or packages delivered we give clear instructions for the delivery people to go to the side door. Its actually the first thing we start with when providing the address.\n\nThe vast majority of the delivery people have no problem following the directions. However, we began having problems with a series of drivers from one pizza place not following the directions, even though the instructions were printed in text roughly twice the size of the address and were positioned right above the address on the receipt.\n\nComplaints to the head office didn't get us anywhere; we would get credits and discounts, and once we even got a free pizza, but the drivers still didn't read the directions.  Reducing the tip didn't seem to get the message across either.\n\nA couple of months ago we ordered pizza from the problem place, and the driver went to the wrong door again.  I decided I had enough.  When I spoke to the driver (a new guy I had never seen before) I pointed out the instruction on the bill, told him I was very disappointed and that the instructions needed to be followed.  He was a little apologetic but he also made excuses. So, to ensure the lesson was hammered in, I didn't give him any tip at all.  \n\nThe look on his face when he realized the consequences told me he had definitely realized he had really messed up.  He really looked shocked and a little hurt. I almost relented and gave him a tip, but I didn't because I realized no tip today would probably ensure he was more diligent in the future.\n\nSince that incident, none of the delivery drivers from that pizza place have missed  the instructions since.  As for the guy I stiffed, I've seen him three times in the last 2 months.  Each time he followed the directions and each time I've given him a 30% tip for both following the directions and for educating the other drivers to follow their directions too.",

        "text": "Reading through some of these posts made me think of this. A lot of them start off with \"I'm not normally the person to call a manager/complain/not tip but...\" And that's how my story starts! I consider myself to be a pretty good tipper. Standard is 20% (I rarely leave just 20, but it's a starting point) and the best tip I've ever left was almost 50%. There is only one time I didn't leave a tip. This is it.\n\nMy now-wife and I went to a large chain burger place to get lunch before she had to go to work. She works 2nd shift and has to be in around 3 so we've done this a lot and we always give ourselves plenty of time to sit down and eat before she has to leave. We also understand if we're running late it's our fault and not the server's...99% of the time.\n\nOn this day, the place is dead. There are maybe 2 other tables with 2-4 people when we sit down and I notice at least 2 servers working. I've never worked in food service before but that sounds like a really good server to customer ratio. (Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.) We're seated as soon as we walk in the door at a table right across from the bar. The waitress comes up after a bit and takes our drink orders and we tell her we're ready to order food too because we always get the same thing. She says she has to grab our drinks before she takes our order but she'll be back soon. Okay, whatever, the bar is right in front of me it won't take long. Wrong. Our waitress proceeds to go to the bar and chat with the bartender for about 10 minutes. I'm not sure if she didn't  realize we could see her or just didn't care. I just chalk it up to it being a slow day and maybe she just forgot about our drinks. It happens. \n\nShe finally comes back with our drinks and just turns around to walk away. I stop her and say we're ready to order. I don't remind her that we already told her that because I always try to give people the benefit of the doubt. Maybe she was just having a bad day. So we order and, anticipating that it will be some time before she comes back, ask for refills of our drinks.\n\nOur food comes out but it's not our waitress who brought it, it's the hostess who first sat us. That's kind of abnormal for this restaurant. Every time we've ever been our server has brought our food save for the rare occasions when it's ridiculously busy. Which it wasn't. We tell the hostess we're waiting for refills on our drinks and she says she'll grab our waitress. She *finally* comes back and says \"Well, you never asked for refills but I guess I could get them now\". This is where I stop giving her the benefit of the doubt. She clearly just didn't care. Frustrating but, again, whatever. When she comes back with the drinks we're almost done with our food and ask for the check. I mention that we're kind of in a hurry (basically a lie, but I worried that we would be if she kept up her pace) so if she could bring it right away that would be great. I've tried to be polite saying please and thank you and smiling and everything even though the scowl on our waitress's face gives the impression that she could kill a puppy and not even bat an eye. She doesn't say sure or okay or anything she just kind of rolls her eyes and walks away. We finish our meal and still no check. Then we finish our drinks and still no check. I glance up to the bar (where the register is) and I see our waitress standing there, holding our check in her hand, talking to the bartender. We watch her for about 15 more minutes (it's been about 30 since we first asked for the check) and then my wife and I start to say things like \"I wonder if something's wrong, our check is taking forever\" and \"I really hope you're not late for work because we can't seem to get the check\". I guess she hears us because she comes over, literally tosses it on the table and says \"I forgot\". I have my debit card in my hand waiting to pay and I try to hand it out to her and, of course, she just walks away. So I get up with the check and the card and catch up with her and say \"we're in a hurry, can you please take care of this for us now?\" She snatches it out of my hand and storms off, in the opposite direction of the register. She gets back to the register a few minutes later and I watch her swipe the card and print out the receipt. Cue *another* 20 minutes of watching her chat up the bartender right in front of me. At this point, I'm over it. My wife and I get up and I walk up to the bar to confront the waitress. I tell her we've been waiting to leave and been watching her ignore us blah blah blah. She just rolls her eyes and says she forgot and reaches out her hand to give me the card and the receipt. I have to lean across the bar to take it because she couldn't be bothered to take one step closer. \n\nSo right in front of her I sign the check, put a big 0 in the tip space, and drop it on the bar. She picks it up and, in a huff complains, \"you didn't leave a tip!\" I look her straight in the eye and say \"I forgot\" before I walk out. Btw, I handed the hostess a few bucks (about 20% of the bill) on the way to the door. She deserves something at least.\n\nTL;DR Rude waitress doesn't get a tip. Hostess does because she actually did her job.",

Unfortunately, they were all out of the colors and sizes that I wanted. \n\nThe cashier tells me that I should check or call in on Friday, as they receive shipments on Thursdays. Thankful for the information, I leave.\n\nThe following day, I debated whether to call the store to make sure the product's available, or just check in person.\n\nNow, I'd rather walk in because I don't feel comfortable talking to people over the phone. However, I had a busy schedule that day, so I decided it was best to call. Also, I work part-time speaking to alumni over the phone. I believe it's best for me because it will help me become more confident in myself and comfortable with others.\n\nI call and press a number to get to the right person:\n\nEmployee: \"Hi, my name is ____, how can I help you?\"\n\nMe: \"Hi! How are you, ____?\"\n\nE: \"Excuse me?\"\n\nMe: \"How are you?\"\n\nE: \"What?\"\n\nMe, a bit louder: \"How are you?\"\n\nE: *hangs up*\n\nAfter realizing that she hung up, I felt ashamed to call back immediately because I thought she'll just hang up on me again, after recognizing my voice.\n\nYes, I know I should've gotten straight to my question right after the first try. However, learning from experience in the tourism industry and my part time job, I just wanted to let the person know that I care about how their day is going so far.\n\nSometimes I'm surprised that I get asked the same question when I work because it makes the conversation easier and more comfortable.\n\nAnyway, I call back hours later, and it's the same person (I directly ask to speak to someone in a certain department this time) I get transferred, just to find out that they're still out of stock.\n\nI hope you are doing okay and I hope your day was fine.\n\nEdit: Grammar",

I know how things **should** go, which sometimes drives me nuts when I'm a customer!  \n\n\nSo, I went to a regional chain store and bought a boxed set of dishes. I brought the heavy box home, opened it up, and found one cup broken.  \n\nThey had a few sets in stock, so rather than lug this 30-pound box round trip, I brought the broken cup and my receipt back to the store.   \n\n(Me=me, ARK= Angry Return Kid, MLG=Manager-Looking Guy)   \n\nMe: \"I bought this set yesterday, and a cup is broken. Here's my receipt, and the broken cup. I'd like to exchange the cup, please\"  \n\nARK: \"No. We can't do that. You have to bring the whole set back.\"  \n\nMe: \"I was going to, but it's pretty heavy, and I didn't want to risk breaking another piece. If we could just open another box and just swap out the cup, that'd be fine.\"  \n\nARK: \"I said we can't do that.\" (adds disgusted huff)  \n\nMe: \"I'm not sure I understand why.\" \n\nARK: (rolls eyes) \"Because then we'll end up with a defective set!\"  \n\nMe: \"So if I bring back my set, you'll exchange it?\"  \n\nARK: \"Yes.\"   \n\nMe: \"But then you'll still have a broken set. The only difference is I'll have to go home, get my set, and come back.\" \n\nARK: (getting loud) \"No. It's not the same thing. If you bring back *your* set, then it'll be *your* set broken, *not* the *store's*\" (eye roll)   \n\n\nMe: (realizing this is going nowhere) \"OK, you know, if it\"s policy, I'm sure you can't do anything more. But, if you don't mind, I'd like to talk to a manager, and see if we can work something out.\"   \n\nARK: (slightly less than yelling) \"No! I'm not calling a manager! You're not exchanging just the cup. Bring the whole set back or you get nothing!\"  \n\nMe: \"Well, look. This isn't a big deal, and nothing to get this upset over. So let me ask you. If I bought a set like this, and a cup is broken, can I return it for a refund?\"  \n\nARK: \"If you bring the *whole* set *and* your receipt, then yes you can get a refund.\"  \n\nMe: \"Fine. I'll take another set just like this one.\"  \n\n(He rings up the sale, I pay cash, and he calls to have another brought down.)  \n\nARK: \"Here's the set. Here's your receipt. If there's any problem, *bring the whole set in*\"   \n\nMe:  \"Ok. But do you mind if I open it and take a quick look?\"   \n\n\nARK: \"*Fine*\"   \n\n(I open the box, swap out my broken cup.)  \n\nMe:  \"You know, I changed my mind. I don't want this set. I'd like to return it. Here's my receipt.\"    \n\nARK: (now yelling) \"No! No way! I'm not taking it back! You' re not getting a refund...\"   \n\n\n(A manager-looking guy comes over)   \n\n\nMLG: (to ARK) \"What's going on?\"  \n\nARK: (very loud)  \"This guy wants to return these dishes but a cup is broke!\"   \n\nMLG: \"Ok, he's got a receipt, it matches the item, just do the refund.\"  \n\nARK: \"NO!The set's broken. *I'm not doing it.* It's not right!\"  \n\nMLG: \"Ok, ARK, go take a 5-minute break, then wait in my office.\"    \n\nARK: \"But, but...\"  \n\nMLG: \"*Now ARK. We will talk later.\"   \n\nMLG: (to me) \"I'm sorry for that. He's been really rude to people lately, and I'm going to take care of it. Sorry for the trouble.\"  \n\nMe: \"Well, don't be too hard on him. I think something more than this return is bothering him. I hope you work it out.\"   \n\n\nSometimes things get out of hand, even when we try not to let them.   \n\nAs a customer, I understand there are policies. But if the policies make no sense, there's no reason the customer should have to go through this.   \n\nThis employee must have had something else going on, and is a good candidate for some \"coaching.\"   \n\nToo bad it happened, but we probably saved the company, and other customers that he would have alienated, a bit of trouble.   \n\nI'm sure there are others who think I was wrong, and provoked him.  \n\nSince I was refused the opportunity to speak with a manager, I didn't have many options.  \n\nWhat would you have done?",

I'm usually posting on r/talesfromretail but this time I was a customer.\n\nI went in to a local lawn and Garden/tool place and while I was looking at mowers, I noticed and employee who, by the looks of him, had a LOOONG day. He was apparently barely upright. He was leaning with his hands on the counter and his head down just taking a breather when some guy pokes his head out from an aisle and WHISTLES like he's calling a dog and yells for this employee to get over there. Already I'm appalled, but it gets worse.\n\nAs I kept looking I ended up just about 15ft or so away from those two and overheard their conversation. The employee said the edger that the man was looking for wasn't in stock on the floor and how typically that means they don't have any at all. Immediately, the man was just about yelling in this poor guy's face about a problem he had once with the delivery guys. I guess they sent him the wrong thing and now he refused to pay a cent before he has something in his hands. I frequent this place so I know that the standard response when something a customer needs is out of stock is to offer to look in the back or order it online. \n\nThe employee didn't even have a chance to take a breath to offer either things from what I heard. This guys just yelled \"you don't have it on the shelf and you won't look, will you?!\" I heard the employee offer to look, which I guess was the wrong thing to do /s. The man almost screamed \"NO! I KNOW YOU WONT BECAUSE I'VE SEEN YOUR ATTITUDE\" and stormed off. Coincidentally that man found the nearest register and reported the \"foul conduct\" to a manager. \n\nI quickly found the same manager after the man left and gave him the real story of what happened.\n\nJust remember folks; retail workers are people too. They have hard days too just like we do. Please don't take it out on them just because you are having a bad day.",

        "text": "First off this might be a bit long so bear with me, first post, on mobile yada yada. A few days ago I went to a local sandwich shop to pick up something tasty for dinner. It was starting to get late, but not too close to closing. I walked in and ordered a Philly cheesesteak type of sandwich with no onions. No problem right? \n\nThe cashier (I think she was the manager- older than the rest, wore a hat) looked at me like I was an idiot when I said that I didn't want onions, so she started listing off every item on the sandwich really slowly asking if I wanted the steak, cheese, etc. Then she sighed when I said it was for here. I was a little annoyed, but just paid and waited for the sandwich. I really don't like to complain about anything (social anxiety ftw). \n\nWhen I sat down and bit into my sandwich I got a mouthful of mushrooms. I can't stand the things and the rude cashier definitely didn't include mushrooms in her list. I checked the menu board hat listed the ingredients and mushrooms were nowhere on it. I didn't want to complain, so I just picked them off and ate the rest no big deal.\n\nI decided to get another sandwich to take home for my mom when she got home. She hates mushrooms more than I do so I planned to specifically ask not to have them on this one. At the register (same angry cashier) I ordered the same sandwich. As she was punching it in (she was actually hitting the register pretty hard) I calmly explained that they put mushrooms on the first one and asked that she not put them on this one. She gave me a worse look than before and said that's what it came with and I told her I wanted them on (I didn't). I didn't want to argue so I asked her to just please leave them off. I paid and waited again.\n\nThis whole time I never implied that I wanted anything for free. I even had my wallet out while I was ordering so she wouldn't think that. I couldn't for the life of me figure out why she was so upset with me from the moment I walked in. She didn't act this way with the other customers in line and I didn't know her. The guy making my sandwich even apologized for the mistake. I mean I work in a similar place and I've had bad days, but I would never treat a customer the way she did I would definitely be fired. ",

I found a really basic box with a couple of different compartments so I opened it up to see how much stuff could fit in. As I was looking I noticed a couple dents on the outside so I decided to just grab another and I headed up to the register.\n\nWhen I got there the cashier, of course, opens up the box and starts looking through the compartments. Apparently this one I picked up was filled with random stuff probably put there by a child. There were fishing hooks and nails and a candy bar and flowers seeds...A bunch of stuff. Cashier freaks out. \"You have to pay for this stuff you know!! You can't just put it in the box and steal from us!\" I had no idea there was anything in the box to begin with so I apologize and say I don't want any of that stuff, I didn't realize it was in there, blah blah blah. Instead of just letting it drop here the cashier continues to accuse me of trying to steal and calls a manager over. I get it. I worked in retail for years but I think at this point I made it very clear I wasn't trying to steal, and even if I was I gave up the second she caught me! \n\nManager comes over and is thankfully more level headed than the cashier. I explain what happened and she lets me pay for my things and leave without incident. 99% of the time I don't have a problem with employees. Like I said, I've been there, so I try my best to be patient and understanding. Working in retail sucks. But, damn, even I know you can't repeatedly accuse someone of stealing!",

        "text": "I've been lurking this sub for so long, but I never thought I'd actually have something to write here before today. It's a bit long so I apologise in advanced.\n\n\nThere's a pretty good Nepalese restaurant in Helsinki. It's near the center and quite cheap so it was one of my favorite place. I took my colleague, Susan, there one time and she also became a fan.\n\n\nWe haven't gone to the place in 1-2 months and Susan was craving Nepalese food so we decided to go today along with my sister.\n\n\nAfter we got off work, we went to the center to wait for my sis. While standing around, I suddenly had a strong urge to try Starbuck coffee. I've heard about it a lot and was really curious what it'd be like. So we stopped by and got some drinks to take along. \n\n\nMy sis arrived, we started walking to the restaurant. The walk was faster than we expected, so when we arrived at the restaurant, we still had the cups in our hands. You can guess where this is heading.\n\n\nWe used to go there very often and around the same time, so we always got the same waiter, who was very friendly and nice. He was not there on this fateful day, instead there were 3 other guys, who I've also seen for a few times but never directly serviced us.\n\n\nOne guy, who I assumed is the Manager because he was the only one with a funny hat, greeted us after we waited by the door a few minutes. We both still had the Starbucks cups on our hand. Another guy seated us at our tables. Neither of them said anything about the cups. \n\n\nWe made ourselves comfortable and started to look through the menu, then suddenly the 3rd guy, let's called him AG (angry guy), came to our table and started talking loudly\n\n\nAG: \"YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO BRING DRINKS IN HERE. WE HAVE OUR OWN PRODUCTS!\"\n\n\nMe: (speechless for a moment because no one ever ever yelled at me in Finland , people are generally very quiet here)\n\n\nSusan: \"It's just tea, it's almost finished, can we just drink it real quick?\"\n\n\nAG: \"NO, YOU CANNOT DRINK IT, WE HAVE OUR OWN DRINKS HERE, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND.\"\n\n\nI'm pretty sure people were all staring at us, so I was about to suggest we could  finish it outside and come back. But then AG reached out and grabbed my drink.\n\n\nAG: \"YOU CANNOT BRING YOUR OWN STUFF HERE, THIS IS THE RULE. I'M GOING TO THROW THESE AWAY.\"\n\n\nI was completely shocked at this point because not only was he so rude, he wanted to throw away our drinks. \n\n\nAt that moment, the manager guy walked by and asked AG what was going on. They exchanged quick words in their own languages so I couldn't understand.\n\n\nAG guy turned around and told us, in a more quiet, but still condescending voice: \"Ok you can keep it this time, but don't​ do it in the future. We have our own products here, this is the rule. Do you understand??\"\n\n\nAnd with that, he left.\n\n\nIt took me about 5m to process what the fck just happened (my emotions usually take longer to catch up in shocking situations) and I was very very angry.\n\n\nI could understand not allowing stuff from other places, but at least they could have said something about it when we were still standing outside, or just politely told us the rule. I would have been fine with that, when I went in the restaurant with the drinks, it didn't​ even cross my mind that it could be bad. I've never brought takeaway drinks there, and in some coffee places here they are okay with you bring some other food. \n\n\nI felt so angry and humiliated because not only did he yell, wanted to throw away my stuff, he kept repeating the same things like we were idiots. I wanted to leave right away, but my sister and Susan started ordering already so I stayed. The food I got didn't suit my taste at all, probably also because I was in a bad mood.\n\n\nI guessed I felt the biggest impact because his yelling was directed at me the whole conversation. Susan was just really craving the good, cheap food so she forgave his rude attitude but said that next time she came back she would request another server. She actually poured her tea into their glass after he left.\n\n\nNot for me, I heard him pretty loud and clear. I won't be bringing anything back inside that restaurant including myself. At least for awhile since I know we were at fault. But really, why would you humiliate your customers​ like that?\n\n\nThe Starbucks latte wasn't even that good.\n\n\nTLDR: Bad Starbucks latte lead to salty waiter and humiliated customer.",

        "text": "This is more of a rant than anything else:\n\nI would like to preface by saying that I know both myself and the cashier were in the wrong.\n\n\nAfter class today, I went to my university's student unoon and looked around for a food place with a short line. The fast food chinese place only had one person in line AND my favorite entree, a combination unheard of, so I went there. The lady making my plate went a little slow, but I had no where to be. \n\n[Note, the plate can be either a 2 or 3 entree. I usually get the 3 with fried rice, 2 entrees, and an eggroll.]\n\nAs the lady starts putting the first entree in my plate, the cashier starts pressuring me to pay. I try to tell her I am going to also get an eggroll, in addition to the 2 entrees, but both ladies misunderstand me. Here is where I lost my temper. As the first lady starts closing the plate with the eggroll, I said I also wanted another entree, finally making clear that I want the 3 entree, not the two. I did so with a \"please\" and an apologetic smile for the misunderstanding. \n\nThe cashier then sneers, in an accustory tone, \"so you want the 3 entree then?\"\n\nThis pissed me off, probably more than it should have, but what it sounded like to me was,  \"you thought you were going to get away with only paying for the 2 entree didn't you?\" \n\nThis made me livid, this was her fault for not waiting!!! I was not dobe ordering, but she was the one rushing me!!! \n\nSo I admit, I rudely replied \"yeah!\" With a \"I tried to tell you that before\" attitude, which I know was wrong \n\nBut I don't like being called a thief\n\n\nRant time:\n\nThis place is not the only place that does this. I can understand when you have a long line, but today, there was no one behind me. I felt the cashier was being rude to me and her coworker. I understand with places like this the name of the game is getting people through quickly, but that's how mistakes get made. A make your own tex mex place mixed up my order with another girls this way. \n\nAmother tex mex make your own place will start 10 entrees at a time with most of them not even close to the serving bar. At sandwich shop, sometimes the sandwiches get  cold just waiting to put veggies on them. Why do places like that do this? I understand you're trying to be fast, but really and truly it starts slowing things down. \n\nSorry for formatting, am on mobile ",

The promotion says \"buy 1, get 1 for $1.\" The lady in two people in front of me has decided that because \"for $1\" is larger than the rest of the type, she's going to read it twice, as \"buy 1 for $1, get 1 for $1.\"\n\nThe kid behind the counter told her that's not what the sign says. She pitched a FIT. \"I CAN READ AND IT SAYS BUY 1 FOR A DOLLAR, GET 1 FOR A DOLLAR!\" The kid again told her that is NOT what the signs says. She screamed at him some more, stomping her feet, claiming that he's trying to rip her off because she's a [rude word for her own ethnicity], and she's going to get the kid fired. All kinds of stupidity. The kid behind the counter just had that *I don't get paid enough for this* look and the manager/owner is nowhere to be seen. (He was having a smoke break as it turned out.)\n\nShe won't let anyone else past her, won't buy her damn drinks, won't leave. The whole store must suffer through her temper tantrum. Now, the full price on that drink is $1.94. She is pitching a fit over 94 cents. I know this because I was holding two of the same brand, planning to use that discount. The sign clearly said exactly what the kid told her it said.\n\nThe guy in front of me tried to give her a buck to get her to shut up and leave, but she said no because \"it's the principle.\" No, it's not! There is no principle involved in berating a minimum wage teenager about a price he neither sets nor controls. There's no principle involved in calling someone prejudiced because you can't freaking read! There's no principle involved in preventing the rest of the line from going home or to work or wherever.\n\nThere is no happy ending. The manager came back in and she got her stupid 94 cents and then had the nerve to look at the cashier and tell him that she KNEW he was ripping her off and she's STILL going to file a complaint against him!\n\nThe only good part is that several of us told the manager the cashier did nothing wrong and would be witnesses if that awful woman made a complaint. He gave us survey info so we could write positive reviews for the kid on the corporate site. I mentioned his patience and professionalism while dealing with a clearly unreasonable customer in mine.

Then came Horrible House.\n\n\n\nHH sounded nice on paper.  Pool, three bedrooms, two bathrooms, good area of town.   Our first clue that things weren't going to go as well as we'd hoped was literally within the first minute of arrival.  \n\n\n**Owner**:  Oh.  You're early.\n\n**Me**:  Yeah, sorry, our plane arrived early, and it didn't take as long to get here as I'd thought.\n\n**Owner**:  Well, the place isn't ready yet.  You'll have to go away until I'm done cleaning.\n\n**Me**:  Uh ... okay.  We'll go buy some groceries.\n\n**Owner**:  Good.  Do that.  *slams door*\n\n\n'Kay.  To be fair, we **were** early.   We left, got groceries, and came back.\n\n\n**Owner**:  Here are the ground rules.  Take out your garbage.  I'm very anal about garbage.  If you don't take it out, I'll keep your damage deposit.  I just had my kitchen counter redone.  I'm very anal about keeping it nice, so do NOT scratch it.  If you do, I'll keep your damage deposit.   Oh, and one more thing - no noise after 10:00 p.m.\n\n**Me**:  Okay - why not?\n\n**Owner**:  Because it'll disturb the downstairs tenants.\n\n**Me**:  What downstairs tenants?  I thought we were renting the entire house?\n\n**Owner**:  No.  You're just renting the upper level.\n\n**Me**:  ...\n\n\n\n\nOn top of that, we had the following to deal with:\n\n\n- There were, by my count, no fewer than 3 urns containing ashes of the owner's dead pets in the bedroom.\n- The kitchen had huge fertility statues.  It's a bit offputting trying to eat Rice Krispies with gigantic genitalia staring at you.\n- Next door was having construction.  Very loud construction.  That pool we'd looked forward to using?  Unusable, unless we felt like wearing noise-cancelling headphones while we swam.\n- And, speaking of noise, the downstairs tenants - the ones we'd been warned not to disturb - liked to have screaming fights in the middle of the night that woke up my daughters.\n\n\n\nAt least I got some good stories out of the deal.  And the next time I used VRBO, I asked the owner \"Do you have urns with your deceased pets' ashes in your rental property?  I have a reason for asking, believe it or not.\"\n",

You see, at the time we were using an ADSL connection, and we had recently switched ISP. The issue we had was that our previous ISP delivered good speeds, but the new one had a wonky connection at best. It kept dropping and disconnecting at any times of day. \n\nAfter troubleshooting everything in the house (houseowners are responsible for the connections inside the house, ISP for the cables outside), I decided to call up tech support, using my cellphone.\nISP: Tech support\nME: Me\n\nISP: Welcome to Company Tech support, how may I help?\n\nME: Hi, we are having some serious connection issues, and I've tested all our cables inside the house and haven't found any faults there. I've tested two modems, and connected directly without a router, using multiple laptops and desktop computers. Can you send a tech to check the cables from my house to the central?\n\nISP: I'm sorry that you are having some issues. Let me do one test here first and I'll let you know. \n\n~On hold for five minutes~\n\nISP: Thank you for waiting. From what I can see we cannot give you 24 mbit at your location, the system only supports 8 mbit. Do you want me to downgrade you?\n\nME: What? No, I didn't call about speeds, I called about dropped connections. \n\nISP: Yes, the system cannot handle the speed at your location. Our only solution is to downgrade your account.\n\nME: Thanks but no thanks. Click.\n\nAfter this horrible experience, I decide to look around some more, and I notice that in Sweden, the ISP's are bound by a rule that says if someone has a home-phone that isn't working, they need to send a technician to fix the issue. I pick up our homephone and I hear a loud static sound over the dialtone.\nI call up ISPP (ISP Phone) instead. \n\nISPP: Same as above\nME: Hi! I'm having some issues with my home-phone, here, listen to this... Picks up homephone with static\nISPP: Oh, that doesn't sound too good. I'll send a technician to your place. Will you be available tomorrow between 8 and 12? \nME: Yes, no problem.\n\nThe next day, I get a phonecall from the technician at 9 am. He is at the base-station and tells me the reason we are having problems is because there are 2 lines available in the cable to our house. The ISP connected us to one line that is broken, so the technician just swapped us to the second cable. And everything worked splendidly after.\n\nA few days later the first tech support person called: \nME: Hello?\n\nISP: Hello! This is person from company. I just want to ask if we should go ahead with downgrading your account...\n\nME: No thank you, I called the support for phones at your company, they sent a technician because the cable from the base station was broken a km or so from my house. It's working now, but no thanks to you. Goodbye. *click*\n\nWhy can't they hire competent people as tech support?",

        "text": "So I'm also a retail drone and frequent poster at r/TalesFromRetail, but recently had an experience that left me wondering...am I a bad customer? Or are you just a very angry person?\n\nI was shopping for cheap jeans at an Australian homewear(?) store. I picked both jeans off the same rack, the difference being one pair was light blue, and the other dark. Identical in every other way, (I checked, because I wanted these specific jeans due to their amazingly good fit on my fat thighs lol) \n\nAt the self checkout however, one scanned as 20$ and the other scanned as 12$. Both had price tickets that said 20$, both had been taken from a reduced to 12$ shelf.\n\nSo I had thought these identical jeans, from the same shelf, were both 12$.\n\nI'm really shy and hate speaking to strangers but I called over the worker overseeing the self checkouts and explained the problem. (W- worker, M- me, A- angry worker)\n\nMe \"hi, yeah these jeans...I think they should be 12?\"\n(Again I'm really shy and trying to be verbatim so I probably stumbled over the right words a bit like this)\n\nW \"ah ok, can I see the tags?\"\n\nI show both tags, both saying 20$\n\nW \"hmm, where did you get them?\"\n\nI point to the display and say\n\nW \"ok, just let me call over A, she knows more than me\"\n\nMe \"ok sure no problem. Sorry\" \n\nI apologise a lot when I'm nervous so in no way did I come across as aggressive or *can I speak to the manager* -esqe. I literally was just asking. \n\nA, already aggressive \"what's the problem?\". She basically spat at me. \n\nMe \"oh nothing really just these jeans? I think they should be 12$? But they've scanned as 20?$\"\n\nA then asked the same questions as W and I gave her the same answers.\n\nMe \"okay yeah. That's fine. Yeah sorry\"\n\nA \"so I don't know what you expect me to do about it\" \n\nUm, why so aggressive? I didn't expect you to do anything about it, unless I was being overcharged? If I'm not thats cool. Thanks for clarifying?\n\nW \"did you want me to take the 20$ jeans off?\" \nShe was already touching the screen starting that process\n\nMe \"no thanks I'll take them both anyways\"\n\nSeriously though. I know customers can be THE WORST, so whenever I need help I try to be a small nice as possible. (Not to mention ~social anxiety~) so why was she so agro? Plz take a zen pill. Sorry ur having a bad day\n\n\n",

I'm setting the scene.\nWe head into a makeup store, as girls do. We're both very into makeup and high end brands especially, so that's what we're looking at. A woman had greeted us, and I didn't notice but my friend says she was shadowing us. Now, I get that girls our age steal, but that's still annoying.\n\nSo we happen upon a clearance section where none of the products have testers. We're browsing for a while, I notice some of the boxes are already empty from presumably been stolen. I comment how sad that is. I then open a box to see what color the lipstick is, because it doesn't say. Without thinking, I swatch it on my hand. My mistake, it was habit. The lady instantly pounces on me.\n\nLady: \"did you just test that on your hand?\"\n\nMe: \"yes I did, I'm sorry, it was habit. It won't happen again.\"\n\n\nLady: \"Well now we have to damage that out because you ruined it. We lose money on that, you realize that, right?\"\n\n\nMe: \"yes, ma'am. Like I said, I'm really sorry I didn't mean to, and I won't do it again\"\n\n\nLady: \"Its ruined. It's germy. There are no testers for clearance, ok???\"\n\n\nMe: \"yup, I got it.\"\n\n\n\nLike I get it, I fucked up, but damn I got it the first time. If I have to pay for it, fine, just tell me that.

While I'm there, I notice the woman on the register next to me.  She's got a cart just FULL of stuff, all bagged up, with her kid in the seat and another one following along.\n\nHer cashier totals it up -- it's quite a large amount.  She hands him a credit card.  Run once, nope.  Run twice, nope.  Run three times, still declined.  Cashier asks her for another card, and looks at her.\n\nAnd she just turns to the cart and starts pushing it out of the store.\n\nIt took the cashier a second or two to realize that this woman was just blatantly stealing everything in her cart, and calls after her, but the woman is pushing the cart with all her strength.  She nearly hits another woman with her own kid (toddler, walking on her own) and doesn't even apologize, just keeps walking.\n\nThe cashier picks up the phone to alert LP, but the woman with the cart had gotten far enough that the only one to try to stop her was the greeter.  And the greeter stepped in her way, and the woman simply moved around him.\n\nShe just walked out of the store with over $500 in product (I'd heard the total, standing where I was).  Which takes this from a simple case of shoplifting to felony theft.\n\nNow, if this were a woman with a cart full of groceries for her family, I'd understand.  And her cart did look like it had food in it.  But it also looked like it had other things.  I saw at least one box from the jewelry counter.  I just don't know why, if she was going to steal all that stuff in the first place, she even bothered to stop at the registers and try to pay first.",

While my daughter was working on some delicious cavities, I watch this nice convertible Mercedes circle the small lot, then make three attempts at backing into an open handicap space before being satisfied with being only *slightly* over the line. A late-teens to early-twenties young man hops out with a young lady of equivalent apparent age and start to look over the menu board. I'm ~~nosy~~ curious, so I wander over to where I can see the back of the car in order to confirm my suspicious.\n\n1. Yes, it is an AMG.\n\n2. No, it does not have a handicap plate or placard.\n\nOn my way back, the kid sort of gives me this excited nod about me noticing his totally cool car that's worth more money than most of the people enjoying this particular establishment make in three years. I meet it with an eyeroll. But once they have their ice cream, I can no longer restrain myself.\n\nI'll be me, he'll be pk (privileged kid):\n\n&gt; me: you really should move your car.\n\n&gt; pk: why? nobody else is parked there.\n\n&gt; me: because it's a handicap spot, and somebody who has problems walking may need to use it. With you parked like that, you're making it hard to use either handicap space, and there's no other parking here right now, so they'd have to go to the bank across the street and walk all the way over here.\n\n&gt; pk: Aw, they can walk. They could use the exercise, am I right?\n\n&gt; me: *disapproving glare*\n\n&gt; pk: It's okay, I know the owner of this place.\n\nAfter spending years in retail, this BS excuse just makes me lose all sense of being polite. The kid looked to be on a date, and I didn't want to ruin things for him. Except now, I kind of did. So I may have spoken a little louder than I needed to so that the people who were trying to strain to listen in could hear us a little more clearly.\n\n&gt; me: You know the owner? Of [franchise ice-cream chain]?\n\n&gt; pk: Yeah, he's cool with me parking there.\n\n&gt; me: Did you know that any time anybody puts a handicap parking sign on a parking space then it becomes legally enforceable by any police officer?\n\n&gt; pk: What?\n\n&gt; me: And did you also know that retail locations like this are required by law to provide those handicap spaces?\n\n&gt; pk: I don't see what that has to do with anything.\n\n&gt; me: Well, I happen to know the cellphone number of one of the officers in this fine city. I don't know if she's on duty tonight or not, but I can certainly text her to gently encourage a cruiser to swing by here. (This was a blatant lie, but I did start texting one of my friends at that moment). Now, the question is if you can manage to move your car before they get here. And do be careful with your ice cream. I'd hate for you to damage those lovely leather seats.\n\nThey left about 2 minutes later. I didn't catch if they still had their ice cream, but hopefully I helped his date get to know him better.",

        "text": "TL;DR: I was followed around the store and harassed by FOUR DIFFERENT EMPLOYEES - including the store manager. I was told I couldn't have my service dog with me, then they demanded that I show them my papers for the dog, I needed to produce a license that says she's a service dog, and regardless of what the federal law is, their rules are different and I have to abide by them. \nI was also told that I had to let people touch, pet, and grab at my service dog. When I told people to leave me alone, I was being rude.\n\n\nNever in my life coming back to this store.\n\n\nThis afternoon I was at a local grocery store and I was accompanied, as I always am, by my service dog.\n\n\nAs I started down an aisle, an employee motioned to the dog and shook her head, speaking very quickly in Spanish. As I am not fluent in Spanish and she didn't try to speak English, so it took me a moment to understand what she was saying. I understood vaguely that she was trying to tell me I couldn't have the dog in the store. I informed her that my dog is a service dog, and pointed out her vest that clearly indicated that she is a service dog. She nodded, I thought she understood, and I went on my way down the aisle. I heard her yelling to someone, but I didn't think much of it.\n\n\nAbout half way down, a different employee walked swiftly up to me, most likely having been instructed to talk to me and tell me in English that I couldn't have the dog in the store - which was the first thing he said to me. I don't recall him greeting me, just telling me I couldn't have \"the dog\" in the store. I told him as well that she is a service dog, not a pet, and that she is allowed in the store if I am. He said \"ok\" and I continued on my way to the next aisle over, attempting to do some shopping still.\n\n\nThen, a third employee - now likely a member of management as he was dressed in business casual blue button down shirt and slacks - walks up to me and tells me again that I can't have \"the dog\" in the store. I tell him, too, that she is a service dog. It's clearly marked on her vest, and I've already told two other employees as much. He tells me he needs to see my paperwork. Says I need to give him a card, she needs to have a license attached to her vest. I tell him it is illegal for him to ask me to produce paperwork, I don't have anything to show him and I don't need it, either. He argued with me telling me that I needed to give him paperwork, or I was going to have to leave the store.\n\n\nOn the ADA Government website (https://www.ada.gov/service_animals_2010.htm) under the heading titled \"Inquiries, Exclusions, Charges, and Other Specific Rules Related to Service Animals\" it is clearly stated that: \"When it is not obvious what service an animal provides, only limited inquires are allowed. Staff may as two questions: (1) is the dog a service animal required because of a disability, and (2) what work or task has the dog been trained to perform. Staff cannot ask about the person's disability, require medical documentation, require a special identification card or training documentation for the dog, or ask that the dog demonstrate its ability to perform the work or task.\"\n\n\nBut that is exactly what happened. The employee demanded more than once that I provide paperwork for my service dog, show my license for my dog, and if I failed to comply, I needed to leave the store. \n\n\nThough I tried to educate him on what the ADA laws are, he scoffed and almost laughed at me, telling me that he knew more than I did, and that somehow the store rules were different. I had had enough of being harassed my the staff, so I told him I was done and would not be giving the store any of my business - now or in the future. He proceeded to follow me to the front of the store, I assume to ensure that I left.\n\n\nHe stopped to talked to a different man in a black polo, and I stopped another staff member to ask who the store manager was, and if it was the person I had just been talking to, who *his* boss was. I was instructed that the man in the black polo was the store manager, and he was called over to me. Before I could say much to him, a stranger with a small child in his arms, came over and tried to grab at my dog, whom I was holding in my arms. I backed up from then and said \"excuse you! Don't touch my dog.\" My service dog is not public property and no one anywhere has any right to touch her in any way, shape or form. She does not exist for the benefit of others, no matter how friendly, soft, beautiful, wonderful, etc she may be. She is a working dog, trained to aid me, and it is absolutely rude and uncalled for for anyone to assume that they can do what they would like with her or to her.\n\n\nI then attempted to talk to the manager, now more agitated and on the verge of a panic attack more than ever, and told him that his employees needed better training on ADA laws and service dogs. I have been followed around and harassed by three different employees and told that I can't have my service dog with me in the store. He told me that they had had some problems in the past with people bringing in dogs claiming that they were service dogs but they were really just pets, and that some new rules had just come down and the employees were instructed to scrutinize dogs in the store. I'm not sure how he thought that that was ok, legal, or would make the situation better. He said that he saw the vest that was clearly marked \"service dog\" and that yes, I could be in the store to shop. \n\nUnfortunately, he saw how incredibly unforgivably rude I was to other guests, so now he didn't want me in the store anymore. When I asked him to clarify, he told me that I told a poor little baby who didn't know any better that they couldn't touch my dog. \n\n\nI told the adult, who was holding the kid and encouraging them to grab my dog, to not touch my dog. \"You were rude\" because somehow it's perfectly acceptable for people to pet and grab at my working dog, but if I ask them not to, I'm in the wrong. Another young boy (preteen age) came up on my side and started petting my dog in a way she didn't like, so I felt her moving away from him. I took a step back from him as well and said, again, \"Excuse me! Please do not touch my dog!\" and the manager again tells me how rude I am being (excuse me, and please is rude?) and that if I'm going to be rude to other shoppers, I wasn't welcome in the store.\n\n\nNot only was I harassed by now FOUR members of staff, I'm being told I have to put up with harassment from other customers as well? No. Completely unacceptable.\n\n\nI have never been more humiliated and felt so harassed by any staff in any establishment that I have been in with my service dog. Before I left the parking lot, I called the corporate office to file a complaint against the store and especially management. I had a panic attack and broke down in tears recounting what had just happened in the store.\n\n\nTo their credit, the gentleman who took my call at the corporate office did apologize for what happened, and ensured the issue would be escalated and dealt with at a higher level. He asked if I would be ok with someone high than store level reaching out to me to follow up, and I agreed. About 40 minutes after I got off the phone, I received a call from the District Manager who not only apologized, he offered to go with me to the store and assist me with my visit. I thanked him for the offer, but let him know that under no circumstance would I ever be setting foot in that location again. \n\n\nHe assured me that he would see to it that the staff received proper training so that something like this wouldn't happen to other patrons. There isn't much you can do about the public thinking that animals are public property, but at minimum the store can handle things much better than they had.\n\n\nI know that my one-time visit will not make-or-break that store, more important to me is standing up for myself and not letting the unforgivable behavior go unnoticed.",

        "text": "so, I live out in rural area. I know the internet options are crud. . . but necessity requires dealing with it. I've managed for years with all kinds of stupidity from them. \n\nFor the last two weeks, my primary service has been out. \n\nInitially, customer service has sworn up and down that it must be a problem on my end. \n\nI've gone thru all the options short of reformatting my drives and reinstalling everything - which they've acted like is nothing and I'm being silly for not wanting to do it. Their other recommendation was having a service tech come out. \n\nso, I eventually relented to having someone come out to check the sat. And mind you, while you can't piss in this area without seeing their advertisements around and there's about ten shops in the county, but apparently there's not even one tech in the whole of the area. And the person that did come out isn't officially associated with the company. so, 80 bux plus a travel and service charge, roughly about 40, to have this guy tell me that everything is connected right and looks okay. \n\nso, called CS again and they told me to try the forums\n\nthe forums while filled with unhappy customers, every message is targeted by customer service reps that tell you to email them or call the isp. And alleged customers that seemingly respond to every complaint about how they've never, ever had a problem with the service and it's just been great for their whole family while explaining that I must be expecting too much of it.  \n\nit appears their 'official' forum is no different from their 'unofficial' forum that I avoided for the same reasons.\n\nand expecting too much of it being I've been with them for over five years, which includes having to use minimal firewalls but heavy blocking apps from ads and images to scripts, a slew of third party apps to try to maintain some protections and track usage, external email accounts as every two to three months you'll be unable to access it for weeks or even months at time, that you otherwise treat it like dial up even if the speeds are better because your usage isn't your usage alone but additionally also calculated by how much your 'neighbors' which extends into multiple states. \n\nBut I do it because I know the other services are as dirty and I work from home, so I need to have regular access, even if it's crappy.\n\nbut this wasn't be throttled, this was clear blockage from the start. \n\nso, I tried the email from this forum, since supposedly I'd be dealing with someone that knew about tech problems vs the usual sales staff that all operate from one script.\n\nBut, of course, they didn't have any answers and suggested the same as the script I'd gotten over the phone; update and reinstall. And always in that order, too. It wasn't working with anything I connected to it, so I sure as heck wasn't going to take that advice on a desperate whim. And again, suggested that I should have another service rep come out (and out of my pocket, again, too)\n\nso, they said they'd look into it and never got back to me\n\nthree days later after emails went unanswered. I called again and now I'm told I'm suspended, this resulted in a back and forth, they wanted me to update my credit information while using their service that I can't access. \n\nthe payment for the month had already been taken out, but I went ahead and updated it with a different card over the phone. \n\ntwo days later, now rather than an activation message when I try using the service it tells me my account has been suspended. \n\nI called again and apparently not related to payment. I apparently violated their TOS in some way. They don't seem to know exactly why. \n\nso, I said fine and I wanted to cancel my service, so now despite being suspended and potentially banned from using the service....  they want me to change my service plan, start up a new contract thru them. \n\nI've yet to actually cancel as I get put on hold and disconnected rather than transferred to whatever department is supposed to handle that\n\nand when I call back they keep trying to get me into another contract. \n\nit's not much of a story, more of a rant/vent. I know eventually they'll likely let me cancel, but going by the stories from other people, it'll probably be after I've paid for another month. \n\nI'm just feeling at a loss here. I'd cut dry and move back to the city, if it weren't for family. I don't know what to do, getting angry with a sales rep isn't going to do anything and you'd know they'd use that as an excuse.  But playing nice or at least professional isn't working either... and I'm feeling like I need an attorney just to cancel my account.\n\n",

I've been browsing the men's Oakley display here for a bit and can't find anything that fits right, so unless you have any other frames in the specifications I gave you I don't think your store has anything for me.\n\n\nSA:  Oh but just try these on!  These would bring out your eyes so well! (I have dark brown eyes, wtf)\n\n\nI opened my mouth to object, but I realized this woman wasn't listening to me at all, so I just turned to walk out of the store and I haven't been there since.  What the heck was that sales associate thinking??  Did only one word (blue) of my description of what I was looking for click for her?",

        "text": "So last night, I bought a recent DVD release of a blockbuster movie at my local supermarket. I was tired at the time, so I didn't notice the fine print.\n\nBasically, the display stand that the DVD's and Blu-Rays were perched upon had a large yellow sticker with the prices on\n\nDVD - £5\nBlu-Ray - £10\n\nI bought the DVD, expecting to pay £5. I was charged £10.\n\nSo I go in this morning to complain, but I made sure to read the display stand, in case there was anything I'd missed. Lo and behold, the fine print says:\n\n*To customers spending £50 or more (or words to that effect).\n\nI was duped. The actual prices of the discs was nowhere to be found until you went to pay for them. All the display stand showed was a discounted price if you spent £50 in store. But hey, at least there's some text that tells you that, text that I reckon 99% of people will not notice.\n\nDirty Tactics if you ask me.",

        "text": "In highschool, an older friend Abe (college age) took me and my friend Carrie to a new Japanese place that had just opened up. We were there for sushi as almost nowhere in town had sushi. There was only one chef and one waitress in the place.\n\nThe menu was in bad, bad, broken english. Some things had \"SP saus\" on their description. We asked the waitress what that meant, and she informed us it was special sauce. We also ask her what is good on the menu and not spicy, as Carrie and I hate spicy food. We made it very clear we didn't want anything spicy. The waitress makes some suggestions, and we ordered $120 in sushi. \n\nWe were so excited! Carrie and I had recently gotten part time jobs, so we were thrilled to splurge on a treat like sushi. Welp, she brought the order out, and out of the ~8 rolls we ordered, two had SPICY sauce, not SPECIAL sauce. We don't touch those beyond Abe trying one piece before realizing it was spicy. We flagged down the waitress and told her they were spicy. She got super flustered and told us it was what we ordered.\n\nWe tried explaining that she told us it was special and that we had made it clear we wanted no spicy stuff, but she wasn't having it. She got angrier and angrier and her broken english was making it very hard to communicate. It was then revealed she was the owner and the chef was her husband, the co owner. We told her we weren't paying for or eating the spicy sushi, but we'd gladly pay for the rest.\n\nThe husband came over and now they're both yelling at us. Abe takes the main line of defense, as he was the oldest and most \"adult\". The other couple in the restaurant is staring at us openly now as Abe and the owners bicker back and forth. The male owner then calls the cops on us. No joke. Abe sends Carrie and I out to the car and tells us to leave and he'll handle it. \n\nThe rest of this is second hand, as Carrie and I leave and drive back to her house. Abe kept trying to explain we didn't order or want anything spicy, but the language barrier was too much. The couple is screaming at him in broken English, so he goes and sits on the curb outside. They follow him and keep going at him until the cops arrive. They all head inside, and the cops hear both sides of the story. The other couple pipes up that the sushi is delicious and they don't know what our problem is. Abe gives them a death stare and the couple chitters happily at the support.\n\nHowever, cops give zero fucks. They tell Abe it's a civil matter and to pay what he ordered and ate. They tell the Asian couple to never call back about something like this again. They. Fucking. Lose. It. \n\nThey go from screaming at Abe to screaming at the cops. Abe throws down 95~ (cost of rolls minus the two we didn't eat). In between shrieking at the cops, they tell Abe to never come back again with us. They closed down less than a year later.\n\nTLDR: Asian owners have communication error with us, want us to pay for food we didn't mean to order. They call the cops on us and ban us from ever coming again.",

        "text": "I have a leg issue that, on good days, requires a single cane. On bad days, it requires a pair of crutches. This particular story takes place a month or so ago, during a series of bad days, in a coffee shop. It's one of the chain coffee shops that has about four or five in every town.\n\nNow, this coffee shop I had stopped going to months before, as they had lost their decent, long term staff, and replaced them with younger (read; cheaper to pay), inexperienced people. I normally went to a different place, but I needed to sit in, and my regular place was full to bursting. The staff in the old place were the same from the staff changeover (mostly) so I thought; \"It can't possibly be that bad anymore. They at least have some experience now.\"\n\nSo I go in, I wait, and get to the till to order. Everything is fine, I pay, barista takes my name, and then asks the question that generally makes my day when my leg is bad; \"Would you like someone to take it to your table when it's ready?\"\n\nI say thank you, that would be great. I find a seat, take out my book and wait. 10 minutes go by. Not a problem, it's a little busy, and the usual group of teenagers have come in. (Lots of iced coffees and syrup laden monstrosities). Next thing, I hear my drink, and my name. It's at the bar. The queue is almost gone, there's maybe two people waiting at pick-up. I have to get up, hobble on one crutch, and get my drink.\n\nThe barista making the drinks looks at me, confirms it's the right drink, looks at my crutch, and then carries on with the next drink. As I'm hobbling back to my seat, trying not to A: spill it and B: Not fall on my face, I notice three baristas at the till, one serving, two chatting away. The two doing nothing see me struggling, and carry on.\n\nTo clarify, on this particular day, my leg was almost completely non weight-bearing. Using one crutch makes it more difficult, as well as painful. Adding the hot, full coffee cup made it downright dangerous. I have not been back to that particular branch since. My regular place has never hesitated to help me with my drink to a table, even when it's mad busy. And they are another well known chain, although less prevelant where I am.",

        "text": "On mobile so sorry.\n\nMy mother recently came to visit after nearly a year in and out of Hospital. To celebrate the fact, we went to her favorite restaurant where she frequented once a week or more during the 22 years she lived here. \nWe entered the steakhouse to find it nearly dead only one other couple was in the entire restaurant which can seat 300 comfortably. We both thought it was odd but considering neither of us have been in there in two years we thought maybe it was an off day or just a bit early for the dinner crowd. \nYou would think with only a total of 4 Dinars in the whole restaurant we would have good service but that was not the case. Once being seated we waited 20 minutes for our server to stop talking go to the kitchen before she even brought our menus. We could see her the whole time because our table was directly in line with the kitchen. My mother asked about blue rare prime rib. For those of you that don't know blue rare is the rarest meat can be sold and still be considered cooked. In all of the years we had eaten there never once was a blue rare piece unable to be found. The server immediately spoke condescendingly that blue rare was impossible because prime rib is a roast not a steak. She then went on to say she would ask the kitchen but she knew it would be impossible. My mom said okay if she can't have prime rib she would like a ribeye blue rare. The woman rolled her eyes and said yes I get it you want your freaking steak Raw. \nI'm a very tolerant person but when you disrespect my mother I will gladly rip your eyes out. I opened my mouth to put her in her place when my mother kicked me under the table. So I let it go. Now here comes the part I didn't like go. \nAt the steakhouse all of your sides are served in a buffet style. That happens to be directly in front of the kitchen. As my mother and I are getting our sides we heard our waitress mock my mother and how my mother requested blue rare. My mother is hard of hearing and wears hearing aids yet still he heard this woman clear as a bell. Our waitress called my mother an idiot and ignorant. At the moment I heard her mock my mother I went and stood in the kitchen doorway which is open to the restaurant. She then said we were effin cheap because we didn't order drinks but the fact was she hadn't given us an opportunity to. The dishwasher saw me standing there and turned beet red and turn back around to the dish pit. Our waitress turn around and said you're not supposed to be in here. She didn't apologize she didn't even seem embarrassed. I told her she could go f herself and I dropped my plate on the kitchen floor. Not proud of that but it was either that or throw it at her. My mom is standing by the salad in tears. The owner is at the counter by the door as she's the host.  She heard and saw nothing.   I grabbed our things as I send mama out the door.   The other table heard and saw everything.  They were just staring.  I said enjoy your meal and walked up to the counter,  where the waitress was trying to spin some tail to the owner. I dropped a 20 on the counter said that should cover the plate I broke. I look at the waitress and said you are a horrible human being. And I left. My mother cried the whole 15 minutes home.  \n I went on Yelp and talked about it. I also went on Facebook to their Facebook page and talked about it. Since this is a small town word gets around very fast and my Facebook was inundated with people sharing the same experiences with that waitress. But no time has the steakhouse apologized and actually made excuses saying that she was just trying to educate us. You don't educate people by talking to them like they're stupid and you don't educate people by mocking them.  Now the lack of people at 7 o'clock on a Friday makes sense. ",
