        "text": "I (39f) own and live on a big horse ranch. One of my employees lives onsite with his wife, and we have many customers who are in and out (100 horses, 4 trainers/instructors, 55 boarding clients and many students). \n\nThis morning my dog was sick, so I had to call around to find a vet who could see him today. I was able to get an appointment and was walking both dogs through the main barn to put the healthy dog in my house and load the sick dog into my truck. I noticed a woman I don't know (65? ish? F) wandering around the parking lot. This is not unusual; we have new clients, or students brought by family members, but I was on alert because we have had a parking lot thief lately, and this woman was wandering so... \\*aimlessly.\\* A trainer and a client, who are my age and my friends, were standing in an aisleway looking at the lady. I asked them if they knew who she was and they said they had been wondering - she arrived alone - and she had been acting strangely. \n\nAt this point she was struggling with trying to open the hood of her car. She stopped doing that and walked out into the parking lot again, kind of circling. I had both dogs with me and I went and asked her if she was looking for someone. She said that she had been here to inquire about riding lessons, and that she had filled out her \"paperwork\" (release forms, I guess?) but that she had left her keys in \"the caretaker's house\" - my dear employee, Fred - and that she needed to go get them. I asked if he knew that she was here, and she said yes, so I said okay. I walked through the back door of my office to put the dogs in a safe spot, and the office was full of cigarette smoke. I found a burned-out cigarette just sitting on my wooden desk next to a stack of \\*blank\\* releases. \n\nI called my employee to ask if he knew what was going on, and he said that some random lady had walked into his house while he was out working, his wife was in the back bedroom and came out to find her sitting on their couch smoking a cigarette, his wife called him and he came in and asked her to leave and she did. \n\nSo I'm on the phone with Fred trying to understand WTF is going on. She had left the front door of my office open, and my younger dog escaped. I dashed out to grab him and she was trying to open the hood of her car again. I collared the dog, put him in the office, picked up the cigarette butt, and approached her again. \n\n\"Ma'am, you left a cigarette burning on my desk.\" She said, \"well, it's not burning, it's out\" and snatched it from my hand. I said, \"This is not going to work out, we're not going to be compatible, and you need to leave.\" She got in her car and put the key in but it wouldn't start. \n\nShe got back out and started messing with the hood again. She couldn't get it open. She was wearing a latex glove on one hand. I felt bad for judging her - she kind of reminded me of my mom, who is often flustered and hard to communicate with, but fully \"with it\" mentally, just a little strange and harmless - but at the same time after leaving a fire hazard in my office and going into Fred's house, she had completely worn out her welcome. \n\nShe asked me to help her fix her car, and I said I wasn't comfortable with that. She said the sheriff helped her get it started earlier, and I said, \"great, the sheriff can come help you again.\" So I asked my friends if they could stay and keep an eye on the situation until Fred could walk over, because I really needed to take my dog to the vet. \n\nLoad up the dog and take him to the vet, calling the sheriff at the same time. \n\nTwo sheriff vehicles arrived, and they ended up taking the lady away and leaving her car here. A sheriff followed up with me and told me that they can't take her car, they told her that she is no longer allowed to be on my property except to get the car. They said I can have it privately towed at my expense if I want to. \n\nI guess I'm just feeling... really guilty? I mean, going into Fred's house and sitting on his couch smoking a cigarette is SUPER INTRUSIVE and scary, right? If she had wandered into my house, which is also right there, I would have been terrified - more so if it had been a man, I guess, but still. Clearly she is unwell, but I saw no indication that she intended any harm. But she left a lit cigarette on my desk, she could have burned the building down. She could have gone into a stall or pasture with a horse and gotten killed. She could have let horses loose, getting someone else killed in the process. SHE WENT INTO FRED'S HOUSE. \n\nBut I'm worrying - I don't want her to come back. I don't want her car here. The windows are partly rolled down and it's going to rain again, but the car is locked and I can't roll the windows up. The front passenger seat is covered in pizza and chicken bones and half-smoked cigarettes, that's going to get wet, and gross, and it's parked right in front of my office - I'm trying to run a business here, that's not a good look. \n\nI don't know if she has a substance issue, or a mental health issue. Could be dementia, or any number of things. But it's not really my business, except that I'm spooked, I don't want her to come back, but I have her car...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for the long post. If anyone has any input I guess I want to hear it.",

        "text": "I've been on several dates w this guy, and I definitely see his good qualities: being respectful and considerate (BIG in my book), taking initiative to make plans, being caring and attentive, remembering details about what I said, texting regularly and checking in with me in between dates. But I have mixed feelings because I feel like our convos could be more engaging and stimulating. I consider myself intelligent, socially and politically informed, and do what I can to contribute to advocacy, volunteering, etc. Taking an interest in, being informed about social issues, and doing what you can as an individual, I feel, is an important outlook on life that I'd like to see in my partner. \n\nSo, although he has great qualities as mentioned, he seems to be living in his own bubble, not being informed as much about what's going on in news and current events and maybe not taking that much interest in social issues. For example, he mentioned he has never heard of the term 'mansplaining'. He said he gets most of his news from reddit to which I made an internal facepalm lol. Don't get me wrong, I am on reddit coz I love the social convos and commentary and learning from people's experiences here. But I am not impressed w someone who gets their news from reddit where anyone can post anything pretty much.\n\nThe other thing is I'm not entirely sure if I'm physically attracted to him. Probably partly because I felt turned off by the mildly interesting level of our convos and the way we were trying to understand each other.\n\nI'm thinking I should give him another chance and see how the next date goes. But I also want to ask, am I having too high of standards? Based on his good qualities alone, should I continue dating him and hope that things would get better?",

        "text": "I've always had a high libido and consider sex to be an important part of a relationship. I'd really like for my next partner to be the same in this respect. \n\nI've come across a number of men who talk as if they are very sexual/have a high libido, but it turns out not to be the case. Like my first boyfriend started out trying to survey me for my sexual interests and kinkiness, and would say dumb stuff like \"men use love to get sex, women use sex to get love\" \"when men cheat it's only about sex\" etc, and yet his ideal frequency was 1-2x a week and he would turn me down in a way that made me feel silly for my horniness. He would talk about wanting to spend the whole morning having sex one weekend but when it was the weekend he'd be antsy if he wasn't out of bed by 10am because he wasn't being productive with his time. Basically he was clueless and not actually a sexual person. But I have found that there are more men who talk the talk, i assume because they are trying to live up to a masculine ideal, than there are who walk the walk. \n\nHow do you gauge this? Do you have discussions about it before really deepening the relationship or committing further? \n\nI think I've been super cautious about leading with sexuality when getting to know men in any capacity, because I want them to see me as more than a sexual distraction to start off with. I also have sexual abuse history so I get put off quickly by men who seem seedy or overly solicitous early on. \n\nHow have you met and developed a relationship with a trustworthy and mature sexually-motivated person?",

        "text": "Part question, part vent, I understand if it gets removed. \n\nMy SO has brought up a number of times that I need to \"open up\" to his family more. I am an introvert, and I am *also* a shy person in general, so socializing does take a whole lot out of me. I can admit I'm not the most verbose, but I have actively been making an effort for the past few months to open up and insert myself into their conversations. (Which are just his mom or dad ranting about how we aren't married with babies yet, a whole other post for another time...) \n\n*Also* within the last few months, I have actively tried to cut down on my drinking. I was getting to the point of being a sloppy drunk, so I said \"enough\" and now, I have my one drink at the beginning of the night and ride that out. I'm really proud of myself; I've not been drunk or hungover in over a year. \n\nHere's where the issue is: last night my partner told me that some of his family think I was too drunk to drive home from one of their Christmas parties. I wasn't, I don't drive drunk and if I had been, we'd have stayed at the house we were in. But they think I was drunk because we got *lost* on the way home because my boyfriend took my phone to change the music but didn't put my maps app back up. I asked him to and he ignored me, so we got turned around and had to take a small detour to get back on track. He, of course, is happy to make fun of me to his family about getting lost, *failing* to mention that it was *him* that took the map away, and that *maybe* I didn't know how to navigate the town we've only been living in for four months. \n\nHis family also thinks that my \"opening up\" socially has just been drunkenness. That I've just gotten hammered every time I go over there and *that's* why I'm talking more. \n\nAnd rather then defend me or point out my progress or do *any fucking thing* else, my bf *brings it back to me* as though it's *my* issue to correct their misperception. I got so upset when he told me that I need to open up *even more*, and then snapped at me when I got upset because \"no one is asking you to change\". Like ???? You're asking me to change a fundamental aspect of how and who I am to make your miserable family....what? Not satisfied, because they weren't happy with the original changes I made. \n\nI have been working so hard to change myself for the better, for *me*, and now I find out that in doing so I have actually made their perception of me worse. At the end of the day I don't need their approval. They can fuck all the way off. But am I wrong to want a partner who will stand up for me? Am I wrong to want my partner to notice the improvements that I *think* I've been making? Be assured, from here on out I will not touch a *drop* of alcohol in their presence. \n\n This has nothing to do with gender and everything to do with reciprocal efforts. I've defended him to my family countless times.",

Rejecting medical interventions in some contexts (eg childbirth) has become far more mainstream.\n\nSo do you trust experts? If not, why not? If so, why? What gives you confidence that an expert is giving you trustworthy information? How do you determine that a fact you come across is believable or not?",

The new apartment manager and I have bumped heads a few times because during COVID I was late on my rent a few times but she could  not evicted me because my city created a ordinance that we couldn’t be evicted during the pandemic. So she eventually tried not to fix stuff around my apartment . So I called the city inspector and they told them to fix the stuff or they have to be fined.\nSo anytime I have to go to the office for stuff she always has an attitude with me. Like she hates me and she rolls her eyes. \nOne of the maintenance workers there mentioned that she is gossiping about me to one of my neighbors that lives below me. I did not believe him at first but that same neighbor that used to talk to me all the time. She stopped talking to me and the grandkids also stopped talking to me. One time she did say “you young girls think y’all cute” but I thought she was joking so I laughed it off. I feel silly now! \nI should also mentioned that the neighbor used to work with my mom in the 80s. That’s why we used to be cool\n\nApparently what was said that I walk around like I’m “all that” and I ain’t that “cute” but I’m broke and a joke. Apparently my love life came up also. \n\nThe neighbor does not know anything about so these are all assumptions. I am quiet and keep to myself. I can be standoffish but that’s because I have ADHD and anxiety and private.. \n\nYes I plan on moving I’m currently looking for a places. It has not been easy because no one movie in the wintertime here. And 1 bedrooms go quickly. \n\nMy question is; what should I do about all this? How should I protect myself? Until I move? Do I have the right to be nervous about all of this. \nThe apartment manger is in her late 40s/early 50s \nThe neighbor is 62 years old \nI’m 30",

In one case we were seeing a couples therapist and this issue came up and she point blank told him he was taking too much ownership of the situation…that he could help me but I had to do the work.

I’ve tried my best to be a helpful person. \n\nI’m used to living alone and having a broken relationship with my parents. I’m not used to big family gatherings or visitors so it’s been a lot. Particularly in a Greek family. \n\nThe last few days I’ve been crumbling. Crying from pmdd, hashimotos flare up and just a feeling I want to be home where no one can judge me or see this. \n\nMy grandma has been amazing and I have shared a lot of my tears and trauma with her. \n\nBut my other family have been giving off some pretty awful cold vibes. It’s like I have done something but I don’t know what it is, and no one will tell me what it is so I’m just picking up on this uncomfortable interactions. \n\nI have excused myself to go and rest and I plan to stay as quiet as possible. But it really bothers me when I am left wondering what is happening. \n\nI try to believe it’s nothing to do with me. But then I wonder if my mum is calling and telling them how horrible I am for not contacting her.  It’s none of their business. I have my reasons for being low contact.

I told my cousin I wasn’t sure what I was going to do. She sounded super relaxed about it and I knew she would be at work so I would’ve been on my own. I decided to fly home direct at the advice of my grandmother and I wanted to be considerate to my cousin and her space. \nI didn’t tell her immediately of my direct flight because I was going to be seeing her in person a few days later. I also didn’t think it mattered. It was a causal invite and not like we would be spending time together. \n\nI overheard my aunt discussing my plans with my grandmother. For some reason it seems like I’ve offended my cousin or something because now they are acting different. \n\nThis is the sort of situation I find myself in when I’m here. And I end up mind reading into everything to determine if I’ve done something wrong. \n\nI just feel crazy. Maybe I am.",

She’s gone through a few but they’re all kind of lacking and, as a result, she’s become increasingly needy with me, constantly messaging me seeking validation for various things and seemingly using me to replace her old therapist.\n\nMeanwhile? I have my own shit. Everyone has their own shit. I cannot respond (and don’t respond) to upwards of 15 texts a day ranging from “my dad emailed my husband” (they’re no contact) to “the barista at LOCAL COFFEE SHOP was acting weird, what did I do wrong?”\n\nI feel exhausted every time I see a text come in. I kept trying to give her the benefit of the doubt that she’d find a therapist she’d click with but it just hasn’t happened. We’ve had a conversation where she’s acknowledged that she leans on me more than she probably should, but that was a year ago and it hasn’t stopped. If anything, she’s become more neurotic and the “trauma bombing” has just increased. \n\nThe worst part is that I know based on how she’s been reacting to literally everything lately that even gently suggesting she tone it down is going to be a meltdown situation because she’s constantly hanging on by a single thread. \n\nHave you ever had to have a conversation like this? I know there’s a better way to put it than “you’re annoying the shit out of me” and “please just send everything you send me to Better Help” but I can’t ignore it anymore and feel like I’m going to hit my brink soon.",

I have no examples in my life of people who are actually happy in long-term relationships, and it leaves me wondering: is this just the natural result of years spent together? My parents are at best roommates/friends, and have both independently admitted to me that they wanted to leave when they were younger, but never found the courage. All of their friends and my extended family seem to simply tolerate their spouses, coping by living pretty independent lives. Several of my friends who gave me the most hope have divorced in recent years, and the ones who are still together seem unhappy more often than they are happy. \n\nI'm not a starry-eyed romantic who believes in \"the one\" and fireworks and honeymoon phase forever. I understand that relationships are hard work. But I guess I have a hard time measuring *how* hard it should be. I'm not even totally sure what I'm asking here, but I guess I just want to understand what a realistic expectation for long-term happiness and compatibility looks like.

I was arranged to sit next to her brother, who was introduced to us as a respectable senior doctor with a big practice now retired and moved to my state. He talked to me for a bit and I left early and did not feel anything weird, mostly because the whole time I was talking to my other coworker who sat on my other side. \n\nAfter that party, I met C at work and she said her brother liked me a lot (C is 2 levels higher than me in the organization; we barely interact. Outside of work, she’s a powerful and well connected person (think city commissioner, etc, I don’t want to be too specific).\n\nI didn’t think much about it , and the old guy (let’s call him F) came to visit C at work a few more times, whenever I ran into him at the hall way he would say stuff about him used to have with 5 assistants all Asian women. Okay weird, but I let it go, mainly because C is leaving the position for 1 year long sabbatical.\n\nLast week, I went to help C wrapping up her projects on her last day. The older guy was there hanging out on her office and he started telling me sexual stories about his old clients when I was doing my tasks.\n\nHe made a few more inappropriate jokes about me being Asian and at this time I got very uncomfortable, but I was done with my tasks and C told him to stop. It was her last day so I just let it go.\n\nTwo days ago I was shorting her left behind documents to run through the shredder, and found a folder containing the whole profile of F, revealing that he was a profiled sexual predator, C moved him to my state during his probation (is this even possible??), and he’s not a doctor or own any practice there was also bills from his counseling sessions that c paid for, letters to judge… everything. How the hell she left that behind in her piles of papers is beyond me\n\nToday, I went had lunch with a coworker who sit on the cubicle outside of c office who was there during the uncomfortable encounter between me and F. I told her F made me very uncomfortable and she was like OMG after you left he said all the weird thing about him having a thing for Asian women, and how C chimed in and said F always thought I was cute and he has always dated Asian women.\n\nI’m sick to the stomach right now. Am I being over dramatic when I’m worried that he might target me, given that c will be in and out of the office this whole year and there are work functions where they might show up together. What would you guys do in this situation?\n\n(I cannot reveal the fact that I saw the folder to anyone in my company)\n\nI apologize for my long post and bad grammar.\n\nThank you!",

They have been discussing marriage within the next year or two. \n\nWithin the last year, one of them told me (we'll call them \"A\") that they had been developing an attraction to a friend of theirs. From what \"A\" explained, it initially was a crush and what I consider to be harmless mild flirting (banter, inside jokes but still  definably platonic.) It then evolved into texting, but still platonic in nature with mostly sharing memes and TikToks for laughs. \n\nThe frequency of texting increased and \"A\" then confided in me that it had taken a turn including confiding in each other about issues within each of their own relationships. \"A\" they admitted it had also gotten sexual on more than one occasion via text, but \"A\" swears it has never crossed the line into physical and it never would.\n\nI have my view and have decided what I will do as a friend to both parties, but I would love to hear from everyone about their thoughts and how they'd handle it if they were me.",

I now also use my social media to talk about self care etc, so a lot of people engage in a positive way to my mental health content; and hence the 15k followers\n\nWe have been dating a year, and have been exclusive for 7 months. She’s had a history of being insecure around social media; which I empathize with; I get insecure too. I’m sure we all do.\n\nThis morning someone (a female) sent her a follow request on Instagram whom follows me and whom I follow back. So she asked me who It was (as this persons account is also private); again, I follow 4k people and 15k follow me so I wasn’t really sure who the person was and I told her so. Her response was; “one of your weird girls”. So I said “why does she have to be weird?”, then I changed the subject because I don’t want to get in a fight.\n\nShe didn’t want to let it go though. She wanted me to admit that the person is weird or that that’s “weird” or “stalker” behavior. I told her I don’t want to invalidate her experience and I realize we have different experiences and ways we use social media so in MY experience it’s not weird; but also I’m not a mindreader, I don’t know this persons motive. But following someone on Instagram seems kinda normal to me. \n\nShe then said “unfollow this person NOW or we’re  over”. Mind you this isn’t a follower I engage with; and I could care less about unfollowing someone. But also my partner has a history of having emotionally abusive/manipulative behavior in our relationship. She says by not unfollowing this person I’m not “protecting her feelings or the relationship”. Do I unfollow this person so she feels more comfortable, or is giving me an ultimatum that if I don’t they’ll end the relationship” manipulative and a sign of how toxic and unhealthy this relationship actually is?",

        "text": "Hello! Couldn’t decide what title to use, but basically, I find myself let down by people often.\n\nI’m pretty sure it comes back to a lack of self respect and self love.\n\nI just find myself being used and unappreciated and then discarded so easily by people - both friends and partners.\n\nI’m seeing a therapist and use a DV hotline often, and I seem to be attracted to narcissistic and psychopathic people.\n\nLately, I was heartbroken by a situationship. I was upfront after 5 months asking if we were exclusive - we were acting like  we were in a relationship (talking every day, having sex, long dates, confiding in each other etc.), only for him to tell me he didn’t want anything serious. So I walked away from that (after a few slip ups in seeing him).\n\nThen I met another guy; he seemed a complete gentleman, always had exciting dates planned, always texting and calling, seemed super into me - though maybe a little too much. He told me I gave him a new lease on life so he was losing weight, renovating his house, overall trying to be better… wanted to be exclusive with me… until I found out he was seeing someone else.\n\nThen, a “good friend” I had, we were super close before, especially when Covid first hit, we were both going through breakups. I would spend up to 6 hours talking to her on the phone about her breakup, and texting constantly - whilst I too was dealing with a broken heart, plus my uncle died, I lost my job and couldn’t get a new one, and then my car broke.\n\nAnyway, she found a new man during Covid which obviously took precedent over the relationship - which is fine. They had babies, and so I understand her difficulties with getting out to catch up and not responding to messages, so I would offer to see her, but she would often ghost. We finally caught up a few months ago when I was going through the situationship issue, and she said to me that she wanted me to be a bridesmaid.\n\nThen she went quiet again over Xmas and ny (fair enough). Today, I found out all over social media, she had asked 3 other friends instead , and I’m no longer a contender.\n\nI just feel so rejected lately - like I’m never the chosen one, and I can’t figure out why.\n\nI’m usually pretty positive and happy, don’t ask for much from people, I’ll always make time for them. But as soon as their problems are over they ditch me.\n\nSituationship guy - I was his therapist/ rebound girl from his second marriage breakup\n\nOther guy - had low self esteem, him dating me gave him confidence to date others (he always said I was way out of his league and I guess superficially I am) \n\nGirlfriend - not just the above, but in general I’m the go to girl for any problems they have, then I’m ditched when they’ve resolved them\n\n\nI’ve been trying to be ok in my own self and do affirmations and manifestations to have more hope for the future, but I just feel like I never seem to belong anywhere or be wanted",

I never do that because I can just bring something from home.\n\nHe has what I consider a pretty big car payment (450/mo). I refuse to have a car payment and will drive my 20 year old paid off car til the wheels fall off.\n\nSometimes I get annoyed with his spending. Even though I think it’s pretty normal.\n\nWe both got raises in the last year and I’d really like to push to pay our house off. It’s something I’ve always wanted to do. But I know he won’t be into that. \n\nWhen you and your spouse have different views on spending habits, how do you find common ground? I feel like I get these low key smug feeling about this and I don’t want to be that way.\n\nAnd just in case anyone comments that we should have talked about this before getting married, I’ll add that my views changed after several years of marriage. I’ve gotten more conservative with money since I’ve gotten older. My husband is about the same as he ever was.",

So during the time we've been working Tho she was nice and sort of a friend with me but I don't really like her work ethics even some of my colleagues didn't like her as well. She likes to gossip about everybody, she is someone u can't really trust, she also likes to throw you out of the bus every time shit happens at work, I had an experience that she talk loudly about my mistake making me look bad inf ront of everyone. So after we got laid off from that company we still keep in touch coz she is like a friend but like what I said I don't trust her and Don't really invest my time with her, so anyway since I started working for other companies she always try her best to apply wherever I am. How did she know where I work everytime!? Its through my LinkedIn account, I see her couple of times a month checking ny profile. She even copied my Position and my headline. I wanted to block her but we have a lot of common friends. So  in my last 2 companies she will always ask me if there is any hiring yet, I even referred her beforw to my boss but it seems like they didn't wanna hire her I just couldn't tell her coz I feel sorry. But this time I think its getting worse, I remember when I lost my job few months ago she told me that she will forward my resume to her ex boss so I sent it to her, and now I am working in a new company, she keeps bothering me about the current role that is hiring so I asked her to send me her resume and I'll see what I can do, to my surprise she copied everything in my resume even the color, font etc. the funny thing is we don't have the same experiences in all jobs but she managed to put it also in her resume, and she also added all my colleaugues and bosses in her linkedi. Account, I haven't even added a single person in my current company. Im really getting very annoyed with her and until today she will always bother me about the latest news and vacancies in my company which I don't even know about. I feel like she is only being nosy and just wants to try hard so she can be part of my team. How should I deal with this kind of person?",
