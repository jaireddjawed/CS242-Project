        "text": "I just joined a small team at rather a large and prestigious company. This small team consists mostly of systems engineers, as distinct from software engineers—they stick mostly to MATLAB, eschewing C++ wherever possible. \n\nYesterday, I discovered why. \n\n    Matrix&lt;6, 6, Float64&gt; mat =\n        (6.5, 2.8, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0,\n        3.7, 9.4, 10.3, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0,\n        0.0, 0.3, 5.8, 4.2, 0.0, 0.0,\n        0.0, 0.0, 7.6, 8.1, 5.7, 0.0,\n        0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.7, 4.2, 8.0, \n        0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 9.9, 0.0);\n\nTo someone who programs in MATLAB, I presume, this looks like it initializes the matrix to those values. To someone who programs in C++, it looks initially like a syntax error. \n\nTurns out, due to the way the `Matrix` class was defined, it's neither of those. This is a perfectly legal line of code that silently fills the matrix with zeros. \n\nMore damning than the fact that this line was written and allowed to exist, I suppose, is the fact that no one noticed the discrepancy over the year or so since it was initially written. \n\nAnd as of four months ago, the line is dead code anyway. \n\nIt's going to be a fun project, I think.",

You know the ones I mean.\n\n4 hours and 30 breakpoints later (was not something the intellisense could detect), I finally work my way to the root of the issue and I realise there must be a line missing.  I get to the home of said line, and what do you know?  It's actually there!  But commented out.  And next to it?  A comment saying that it's commented out.  Like so:\n\n    //List&lt;object&gt; ImportantThings;    //Commented out for testing\n\nWTF?!?\n\nThe worse part is that it was done 2 months ago and the code has been broken since then (I came on board two weeks ago). Would trout-slap responsible developer in person but (un)fortunately he is no longer with us (I hear he got a better offer at another company, god help us all...)\n\nI guess the theory was, hey if nothing breaks maybe we didn't need it?  By all means run that locally for a while, but...\n\nDO NOT CHECK SHIT LIKE THIS IN!!",

It has to by volatile semantics... (It's actually worse than that, as it has to conditionally do 1-4 loads depending...) And this happens _everywhere_. SetX followed immediately by GetX, etc, etc.\n\nBonus: I have stripped away the 3-7 layers of indirection here. In actuality e.g. getC is actually a function calling function (casting enum to boolean) calling function (casting boolean to an enum) calling a class method (through a pointer) (even though there is exactly one instance of said class), and the someRegister pointer is an instance variable of that class (even though the address never changes) (but the pointer isn't set in the constructor, it's set in a separate init function instead) (and [NULL is a valid pointer](https://www.reddit.com/r/programminghorror/comments/62ihu4/ignorance_is_bliss_or_null_is_fine_right/), which causes amusements if you inadvertently call things before init...). A sufficiently advanced compiler helps somewhat with this, sometimes. Nonetheless...",

This list is copy-pasted from an email I sent to my client this morning - whose code I was tasked to *improve* - where I point out some issues with the main structure, which is all stuffed into a grotesque 1800-line beast. This list is not exhaustive, as there are **many** smaller issues which the client, who does not know much about software development, wouldn't really understand. These are just the basics:\n\n* no comments apart from commented-out test code,\n\n* extensive use of “magic numbers”,\n\n* no use of constants but many hard-coded values,\n\n* no adherence to nor consistency with regards to code formatting practices,\n\n* using names for variables and functions which conflict with their intent or purpose,\n\n* misleading or contradictory error and debug messages,\n\n* renaming global variables in odd places for no reason,\n\n* segments of working code repeatedly copy-pasted in stead of encapsulating it as a function,\n\n* conditional tests where the conditions cannot ever be met,\n\n* the use of [potentially infinite] “while loops” with no time-out or termination escapes built in,\n\n* large sequential “if-then-else” blocks where basic techniques such as “switch” or loops would be more appropriate,\n\n* performing the same tasks repeatedly in loops without any changes between repeats,\n\n* deeply multi-level nested loops and functions nested within conditional trains,\n\n* branching off to dead ends and cliff edges,\n\n* large tracts of unrelated code grouped inside of generic “try-catch” blocks with cryptic error messages,\n\n* abusive use of language features such as functions-inside-functions and object-member/array-element ambiguities,\n\n* unexpected re-declaration or re-instantiation of variables/objects in unusual places,\n\n* ghost variables and functions that are never used or called,\n\n* processes going through great effort to accomplish some thing only to undo or disregard everything at the end,\n\n* variables declared and then implemented across different files,\n\n* production code and test code is finely interleaved with no apparent distinction and\n\n* it is obvious that large swathes of code has been copy-pasted from sources on the internet, as-is, modified in places only to suite the immediate need with little regard for the knock-on effects.\n\n*edit:* Oh, forgot to mention, this is active **production code**...\n\n**Update 17/07/17:** I've just received their response and I have stated my case well.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/programminghorror/comments/6lporb/how_to_sabotage_production_with_a_simple_select/",
        "text": "I work as a developer in a tiny team that is supporting, upgrading and gradually rewriting the warehouse management system [wms].\nThere are many things here that can qualify as /r/programminghorror but I want to share the one that caused almost a year of our workers' suffering and for which I feel responsible.\nSo the main setup is this: we use MSSQL as the main component of the wms. The database doesn't just store data but processes the whole lot of it by means of dozens of jobs and hundreds of stored procedures and functions. The interface is served by IIS6 + PHP5 on the very same server and the personal data terminals [pdt] connect to the database and execute series of procedures, each responding with tags that pdt client draws screen from and values+next procedure to pass it to.\n\nThis is how the whole package was bought from the original developer ~10 years ago and we can't change the setup drastically as we aren't viewed as competent enough and \"if it works...\". But we do push constant changes and minor updates as the business needs keep changing during that timespan. As you can imagine - vastly expanded functionality on predefined setup leads to hiccups in performance and overall gradual slowdown. So we improve or ditch the parts of the system that are bottlenecking and rewrite them from scratch focusing on performance - this is a neverending circle, but it keeps business in business, us employed and system ever expanding.\n\nThe icing on the cake is the fact that we aren't provided with any mirroring server or test platform and every update is done on the production database/filesystem while the warehouse (one or all of them) is working with the same system (24/7). At least it provides us with rather instantaneous feedback when we do forget to put a semicolon in place. As a downside - not once the whole tables have been wiped due to someone's temporarily mental incapacity.\n\nSo here comes the horror I am to tell you about - it starts slowly creeping more that a year ago as we start getting calls about pdt freezing or crashing to desktop as any new picking pallet is being scanned. Luckily only the first warehouse is affected but it's the oldest one and actually the one where we test all the good new stuff so it's hardly surprising that this warehouse takes the most hits.\nUnfortunately the issue is not consistent: every time we check - everything works. Maybe slightly slower that usual but nothing that could point to any specific bug.\nTime passes and we get more of the same calls but eventually we just decide to wipe the whole process of setting up new picking tare and write it anew someday later. The way the original code is written is definitely ugly and non optimal so almost always rewriting the whole chunks takes less time and yields more results. As the issue is not critical (warehouse staff claims they still can work yet much inconveniently) and the chunk to rewrite is quite a massive one - we keep prioritizing other things over it again and again.\n\nAlmost a year passes by and the current project I was working on is the new pdt client program. The legacy pdt program is effectively a black box - we can see what sql procedures output to it but we can't see how the client processes the data and how the screen is being drawn. But the legacy client doesn't support new winCE versions and the hardware supplier has stopped manufacturing pdt with old winCE on board so we are tasked to create a compatible client program. With a bit of reverse engineering and even lesser amount of wits - I manage to produce a working prototype using C# and it really does work despite a few empty catch{} blocks that keep it from cdt constantly (I had no idea how to properly access the hardware barcode reader nor how to write programs in C# so you may forgive me this yet another /r/programminghorror bit).\n\nNow you have struggled through my mess of a writing and got to an actual juicy part. I send my client to that very first warehouse to test it in all the operations. Including the problematic one that we've been getting complaints about for a year. Of course it freezes and then crashes and is totally unable to handle that operation. And you bet that the warehouse need new pdt set and ready exactly for that operation. So I visit the warehouse to see the problem personally and devise a solution. The pdt with my program really does freeze for solid 5 minutes and becomes inoperable for that time unless I pull the battery. Old program behaves similarly but it crashes much sooner, after about a minute or two. And the every other time it does complete the requested operation on the server side, I am being told.\n\nSo there I was - trying to find out how does that black box program handle the unknown issue better (or worse?) than my own abomination.\nAs trying to win a stare contest with a C# is always a futile enterprise - I've decided to tackle the other side of the issue and dived down in a sea of shitty sql queries.\nAt first glance everything was in order - as it was at a tenth and hundredth glances throughout the year as well, so as a last resort I started simulating pdt request directly in sql, writing every one of them by hand until I got to that problematic procedure.\n\nIt did work fine. It did work surprisingly fast (which explains why we couldn't find any slowdowns by analyzing all of the queries). It has supplied all of the necessary tags the pdt was expecting. And on top of all that it did supply a few billion records from the log table.\n\nWhat really happened was that someone's must have used the same tab with the procedure listing to view the logs and forgot to edit out that query before altering the changes in code. It's quite easy to do if the procedure spans a great distance vertically so it is best to use other tabs to view any accessory information even if it's just basic [select * from log]. And we do use the other tabs and we do keep an eye for such things. But someone from our tiny team did it nonetheless and year ago it just as well could've been me.\n\nWhy was basic select causing such issues? Well it wasn't causing any trouble for the database, but as the log grew - it did spew out more and more garbage information to the pdt client. And all of that data had to be downloaded via weak WiFi every time and even worse - the pdt program had to parse through billions of rows to actually disregard them as garbage. The pdt hardware is not exactly state of the art despite it's very much rare-art-like cost.\n\nSo the workers at the warehouse have been dealing with hundreds to thousands hangups and cdt's every day for about a year just because someone from our team was too lazy to press alt+n and too careless to leave a garbage query in the production procedure.\n\nSome time has passed since and I still feel quite bad about this whole thing, but I'd like to think that it did teach me something. If not to dig a little deeper when the issue seems complicated then at least to look for some simple stray code instead of analyzing complex queries for poor performance and deadlocks.\n\n/*I apologize in advance for my poor writing as you could've guessed - english isn't my first language.\nAnd this is my first big post on reddit and first in this subreddit, so I hope I didn't break any rules and the topic was at least a wee bit interesting.

Hooking up two different softwares so they could communicate.\n\nWe'd been waiting for some documentation to a public(but licensed) API, so work could start. The API was a bit like an add-on that could be purchased separately.\n\nAfter a while, we got a response. But it wasn't what we were expecting.\n\n&gt; A document outlining what can be done using our API will not be available. It would be too dangerous as someone could write software to replace --productname-- if they had the documentation.\n\nIf it was up to me, I would have stopped using --productname--, but sadly, it wasn't, so we were integrating with an API almost blindly. \n\nNot knowing what requests are possible and just trying to guess/hack the original software to see what's really going on. is it a POST or a PUT to 127.0.0.1/object ? What does the property \"I\" mean in the GET response to /objects ? Ah, it's the limit that has a default value of 20 and is used for pagination, so you can make a GET request to /objects?l=40. But if there's a limit, there should be an offset as well? yep, /objects?l=40&amp;off=15 seems to do something, might be it.\n\nOk, So objects have pagination, but otherObjects?\n\n    GET /other-objects?l=40&amp;off=15\n\nNope, OtherObjects don't have pagination. Pure trial and error for ~40 API endpoints.\n\nOf-course, in the end we had a document that outlined what can be done and what can't be done. Also the client ended up paying around 4x more for our work.\n\ntl;dr: Companies publishing API docs are making a Serious mistake and jeopardising their business model.",

The Pro Git book is 550+ pages long.\n\nSo why, you, as a developer would use Git? What happen to \"the best tool for the job\"?

Or your company is forcing you to?\n\nI apologize for my first post being a rant, but recently I was forced to use Git in a new repository and it has been nothing but pain, for almost every simple step my old trusty GitHub GUI started throwing errors.\n\nLooking online, it’s like a rash – it’s not only me getting into issues.

        "text": "I think you guys might enjoy this:  \nEarlier today, I was talking with my boss about one of the CMS systems that we run for our users (students). For a little background, my boss used to be a .NET developer like 10 years ago, but has little to no experience in modern stuff, he's mainly an IT director for myself and some infrastructure/IT staff. In the process of discussing the need for a new plugin for the CMS, he off-handedly mentions the fact that he tried to _edit the CMS_ before to cover the problem that we were trying to figure out how to solve. That terrified me a bit, so I asked for a bit of clarification, hoping that he just meant editing a template file somewhere or something. No. _He live edited a plugin built in with the CMS that he knew nothing about the side effects of, in a language that he had never touched before, on a live production server that hosted what is pretty handily the most important service that we have._ And he told no one about it until just now, months after the fact. This is the story of the death of my afternoon.",
