What is the actual basis for this belief?  How do we know that churches didn’t paint there walls with buff naked people to draw in the pubescent+ crowd and keep them in the building staring at the art?  \n\nWhere else would average people have seen perfectly executed representations of naked people with god bodies flexing around and stuff, other than in church?   Who is to say that the church and everyone else that cared about maintaining public support and attendance didn’t use nude art in the same way that comedy movies in the 80s used gratuitous topless scenes to bring people in?",

However, it also spurred the development of seismological research. How did the disaster contribute to scientific advancements?",

        "text": "Looking for a more detailed explanation of this blurb on a website I found, with more sources:\n\n&gt;\"While religious interpretations of the disaster were widespread, the earthquake also sparked interest in emerging scientific explanations of seismic activity. The discoveries and debates of the emerging discipline of seismology had been filtering into Ottoman intellectual circles from the mid-19th century onward, and in the aftermath of the 1894 earthquake, many newspapers and journals printed articles discussing the causes of earthquakes in scientific terms.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The 1894 earthquake served as a major impetus for the development of seismological research in the Ottoman Empire. Sultan Abdülhamid II commissioned Demetrius Eginitis, the director of the Greek National Observatory, to come to Istanbul and produce a report on the causes of the earthquake, which Eginitis completed in August.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Ottoman ambassadors in Europe were ordered to write reports about the state of seismological research and instrumentation in the countries where they were posted, and a committee in Istanbul drew on this information to plan the creation of a local seismological service.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Shortly thereafter, the government authorized funding for the foundation of Istanbul’s first seismological observatory, in Maçka, and hired the prominent Italian seismologist Giovanni Agamenonne to be its director.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Agamenonne’s successor, Salih Zeki Bey, and the group of researchers they trained became the founding scholars of seismology in the Ottoman Empire and the Turkish Republic. The seismic observatory was eventually relocated to Kandilli after the founding of the Republic, and is now the Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Source: Bein, Amit. “The Istanbul Earthquake of 1894 and Science in the Late Ottoman Empire.” *Middle Eastern Studies*, vol. 44, no. 6, 2008, pp. 909–24. JSTOR.\n\nMy main question is: \"How did the 1894 Istanbul earthquake affect seismology, and the early history of seismology, as a whole? How important was it, compared to other earthquakes, in advancing seismology? Was it primarily a localized impact, confined to the Ottoman Empire (Turkey), or an international impact?\"\n\nAnother question is: \"Following the 1894 Istanbul earthquake, Alexander Vallaury (1850–1921), a French-Ottoman architect, who founded architectural education, was appointed to work on various commissions for city planning in rebuilding Istanbul. Remembered by Osman Hamdi Bey as the 'City Architect' (*Mimar-ı Şehir*), Vallaury was almost invariably the architect chosen by the upper echelons of Ottoman high officials. In 1896, he was awarded France's Legion of Honour, along with many other medals from the French and Ottoman governments, in recognition for his services. How much did Vallaury's architecture influence post-1894 Istanbul, and did Vallaury incorporate more earthquake-resistant architecture?\"\n\nFor the latter question, Wikipedia only states the following: \"In a *Scientific American* article from May 1884, 'Buildings that Resist Earthquakes' described early engineering efforts, such as Shōsōin, \\[a wooden Japanese building in the *azekura* (log-cabin) style with a raised floor\\]. \\[As a result of assembling the storehouse without bolts or nails, the structure of Shōsōin became very flexible, and able to withstand earthquakes.\\]\"\n\nPer the article \"Seismic retrofitting\": \"Prior to the introduction of modern seismic codes in the late 1960s for developed countries (US, Japan etc.) and late 1970s for many other parts of the world (**Turkey**, China etc.), many structures were designed without adequate detailing and reinforcement for seismic protection. In view of the imminent problem, various research work has been carried out.\"\n\nHowever, further down in the article, there's also this line: \"Wood is one of the best materials for earthquake-resistant construction, since it is lightweight and more flexible than masonry. It is easy to work with and less expensive than steel, masonry, or concrete. \\[...\\] Wooden framing is efficient when combined with masonry, if the structure is properly designed. In **Turkey**, the traditional houses (*bagdadi*) are made with this technology.\" *(No citations.)*\n\n*Lastly: I'm aware that the government of Turkey has requested that people refer to the country as \"Türkiye\", but for search bar purposes, I decided to stick with \"Turkey\" for the time being.*",

However, the more I read the article the more confused I became.\n\nFirstly, it suggests the manorial seat in question was not Saxon at all but Viking, having been founded in the Danelaw (and it is oddly translated as 'Lord of Viking's Iron', when on [other websites](http://wikimapia.org/5878019/Saxons-Lode) 'lode' is simply defined a river fording place). Secondly, it seems to imply it is some great and prestigious seat, and yet Saxons Lode today is just a farmhouse, as far as I can work out. And thirdly there's the matter of the terrifying looking coat of arms, for which the article doesn't state any provenance or history behind it.\n\nIs there some reason why Saxons Lode is singled out with a dedicated article, when so many manorial territories pass without comment? Or is there something sinister behind this article?",

It seems as if it's just forgotten about by the rest of the nation, and the living conditions there now often resemble that of a developing country. A few weeks ago, I drove through some rural areas of northern West Virginia, just to see mostly shanty mobile home communities, barn buildings that seemed to have been deserted for years, and small towns that clearly teetered on the edge of poverty. However, driving through the state, it was clear that at some point, there was some amount of wealth among the citizens. All those deserted barns and houses had to have been inhabited at *some* point, and I always hear the term \"decline\" when associated with the region, whether it be in terms of population, income, or quality of life.\n\nWas there ever a time where Appalachia was a profitable region? I know that coal mining was generally a low-paying job with high health risks, but it did make money, and people were sure to benefit off of it. I'm also aware of several famous old celebrities and figures and from West Virginia, but it seems that nothing has come out of the state in decades. \n\nWas West Virginia a tourist destination due to its mountains? How much money did citizens make and did they live comfortable lives? What would citizens do for leisure before the Opioid Epidemic? Was there ever a time when the state was beheld among the nation for some metric?\n\nI'm sorry if this is a confusing and perhaps vague question, but I'm just shocked as to how little reputation the state has nowadays, and I'd like to know if there was a point where West Virginia was regarded as more than just wilderness.\n\nThank you!

Did he have to share the power with the people  as oposed to just deciding himself or what did the people actually achieve at this point???\n\nSecond: In 1792 king Philip XVI and his wife are executed. One of the audioguides says that this marked the moment ‘monarchy was abolished’. How the heck was it ‘abolished’ if in 1830(another french revolution) France still had a king(Charles X) which was even replaced by yet another king????

        "text": "I recently read/watched up on Cu Chulainns exploits, including his wise-master tutelage (and saucy development) under the female martial artist Scáthach.\n\nLater, I was playing Total War Attilla, and pondering/reading the bios for the all-female units. One, the Scatha's Teachers, suggested that martial arts in Celtic society were usually taught by women, not just once or twice in legend.\n\n\"It is notable that the Celtic martial arts were usually taught by women, some believing that the teachers were also priestesses, and that they conferred additional powers to their chosen students when in battle.\"\n\nhttps://totalwar.fandom.com/wiki/Scatha%27s_Teachers_(Total_War:_Attila)\n\nI'm wondering if this is true, and if so what documentation is there?\n\nThere's a degree of controversy nowadays when discussing historical female warriors; the truth that males get the big end of the stick in terms physical sexual dimorphism, and that this combined with the mechanics of population growth means that most soldiers in history were male as a matter of practicality, is often taken as offensive, or demeaning.\n\nAnd fair enough, there are plenty of people who do say true things timed specifically to undermine or hurt people; and I wouldn't expect anyone with self-respect to swallow a truth served in that style. That's not what I'm getting at here. No boys vs. girls clubhouse nonsense.\n\nI'm interested in the social, and societal implications; and how they would affect day-to-day life.\n\nI've read of Norse cultures with defined gender roles, where females while not typically given to leadership roles were deferred to in the areas of prophesy and magic. And while the various Danish tribes had legends of warrior Goddesses, and Valkyries; they seemed to be more a shared flight of fancy than a reflection of day-to-day life. IOW, just because Freyja was a badass godess, didn't mean your average nordic woman was going out a-viking on the regular.\n\nFor the Celts though, widespread female martial arts teachers would imply a different dynamic. That the knowledge of combat was female in origin, only practiced and elevated by male students. And there's social implications there too about the nature of a Celtic warrior - that a man must first be attractive or chivalrous, or else never receive from a woman the attentions that would make him a real warrior.\n\nAnyway; I want to know - is there more documentation about this, or is this just a game company exaggerating a one-off legend for fancy or inclusivity appeal?",

Scanned? Left as-is? It depends? I assume the local government contacts the local university for the archaeological examination, but how does the university choose a team to do this work?), but I wanted to ask specifically about one thing: How is information \"extracted\" from it? \n\nIn the case of an artifact that can provide new information about a given area in a specific period of time, at what point in the process is that information exposed to the field, and how? Do archaeologists write a paper on their process to extract the sword, venturing a guess about new ideas it may raise? Do museum personnel write about the restoration and the details with respect to other similar artifacts? Is an independent researcher responsible for the analysis taking other's data into account? Does the artifact simply end in a collection until someone decides to make an analysis that involves it?",

However, despite the relevance of said Indo-European languages, there are \"outliers\", languages that were developed independently from this main \"phylum\", such as the Etruscan language. \n\nQuoting the Metropolitan museum (https:// www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/etla/hd_etla.htm)\n\n\"The Etruscan language is a unique, non-Indo-European outlier in the ancient Greco-Roman world. There are no known parent languages to Etruscan, nor are there any modern descendants, as Latin gradually replaced it, along with other Italic languages, as the Romans gradually took control of the Italian peninsula\"\n\n\"We have no surviving histories or literature in Etruscan, and the only extant writing that can be considered a text, as opposed to an inscription, was painted in ink on linen, preserved through the fortuitous reuse of the linen as wrappings for an Egyptian mummy now in Zagreb. The existence of such objects like an Etruscan abecedarium in the form of an inkwell (24.97.21a,b), as well as artistic representations of books or scrolls, confirms a written tradition on perishable materials\"\n\n\"While there is still much we do not know about the Etruscan language, the corpus of inscriptions continues to grow through new discoveries, affording us new insights into the literary world of the Etruscans that was lost under the rising tide of Roman influence and power.\"\n\nBeside this information,  has there been any recent development within this field, and if so, are there any sources/ informations/ publications that I am not aware of? \nOther than the study material itself, is there a way to learn more about the language itself (alphabet, basic structure, etc..)?\nThanks in advance for any possible answer.",

I started thinking about some potential candidates and want to know if I’m on the right track. Obviously the method of killing gives us wildly large estimates, so for the purposes of this thought exercise let’s keep it anything including a sniper or below. So for example, the pilot of the bomber that dropped a nuke on Hiroshima does not count, nor do drone pilots, artillery, submarine captains, helicopter pilots, etc. Here are my candidates:\n\n1.\tA serial killer.   According to Wikipedia the most prolific serial killer is Luis Garavito with a 193 proven victims.  Wikipedia states that this does not include any serial killers before 1900 so we may be missing one but still, 200 sounds like a reasonable cap.\n2.\tAn executioner. I listen to a few history podcasts and remember an episode of Hardcore History about executioners who had supposedly executed hundreds of people during their lifetimes during the Middle Ages when executions were public spectacles and paid for by the State, but wondering if any historians here have more accurate numbers.\n3.\tPerhaps a soldier/warrior. Not sure whether an ancient solder or modern soldier would have more kills, according to Wikipedia Chuck Mawhinney has the most confirmed kills of any US soldier with 103, and 216 probable kills. \n4.\tCult Leader.  Obviously Jonestown is the most famous but technically they were suicides (unknown to the victims at the time) so I’m not sure if this counts. A total of 909 people died.\n5.\tcombination soldier/executioner. Again something I heard on an episode of hardcore history. Apparently Mongol soldiers would be responsible not only for killing in battle, but also served as executioners afterwards. Dan Carlin mentioned that some of these soldiers may have executed hundreds of people per day after a city was captured, but unsure if we have any reliable numbers.\n6.\tsomething I’ve missed. Maybe a crazy doctor/scientist that experimented on people? Or an arsonist who set fire to a large building? \n\nAnyways, if any historians have any good answers to this question, I would really appreciate the insight!",

My aunt Veta was sixteen when she joined a resistance and would smuggle information on her person in the same house as Nazi soldiers. She and some other girls even killed a few guys. Her brothers would be killed during the war. People in their village would be shot dead as punishment and then others would be charged for the bullets used. My dad interviewed Veta for a paper he was doing for Harvard and he’s told me all about her. She’s an idol to the family. \n\nI have memories of happily talking about my mothers side of the family participating or living through WW2 during school and being called a liar because greece never fought in WW2. It always frustrated me and it happened again in my honors history class during a discussion. \n\nWhat are some cases of Greece, or greeks, during WW2? Who were the resistance fighters? What were the movements? What happened outside of the actual German occupation, which people still seem to deny? I’m so tired of being called a liar about my own history and can’t find much information.",

        "text": "There seems to be a lot of discrepency in the figures given for the revenue of ancient states to the point they do not add up. The one that makes sense the least is during the war of the Diadochi, Demetrius of Phaleron who was appointed govenor of Athens by Cassander at the time, squandered most of Athen's yearly revenue which was supposedly 1200 talents. This seems like a ridiculous amount for a single city when I saw a comment by Iphikrates in an old post that revenue of Persia under Darius was 14,500 talents a year. This seems even more ridiculous of an amount when looking at wikipedia for the economics of the Byzantine Empire it says \"By the end of Marcian's reign, the annual revenue for the Eastern empire was 7,800,000 solidi, thus allowing him to amass about 100,000 pounds/45 tonnes of gold or 7,200,000 solidi for the imperial treasury\". Compare this to 100,00 pounds of gold revenue of the eastern roman empire, to the 1200 yearly talents of a subhugated Athens that is far from its golden age, which is just under 70 thousands pounds of silver.\n\nAre these figures reliable? And If not what would be the revenue of ancient greek states like Athens, Sparta and Macedon?",
