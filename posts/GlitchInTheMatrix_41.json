        "text": "A lot of times in conversations with my sister, we would mention things from TV episodes of different shows that would relate to events in our lives.\n\nFor example, we had just bought a couch and had to carry it up the stairs to our second floor, and while doing so, I made the joke about [\"Pivot\"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5DHU8SwYJ0) from Friends.\n\nAbout a year later, we were discussing how difficult it was to carry the couch up the stairs, and I brought up that pivot joke again. Later on that day, a Friends rerun comes on TV and it is that exact episode.\n\nThis happens frequently, but a lot of times a thought of a specific scene pops into my head, and that episode comes on the same day. I usually never tell anyone, but it's kinda cool when that happens.",

As we're driving we hear on the radio that a famous actor has been in a terrible accident and more is to follow.\n\nAs we get to the mall the newscaster comes back and announces that (and this is where it gets fucking weird) Pierce Brosnan has died in a horrible accident. The announcer says that Pierce was out hiking he got caught in a sudden storm and he was struck by lightning killing him and injuring someone else. Now, the reason I remember it so well as Pierce Brosnan was that A. I loved Goldeneye, and B. My mom really likes Pierce Brosnan. So we were both aghast. \n\nWe went into the mall, did whatever shopping we had to do.\n\nCame back to the car and turned the radio on hoping to hear more about the story: nothing. Got home hoping to hear about it on the news: nothing. Went on AOL to see if there was anything: nothing.\n\nReally freaked us out and the both of us still remember it to this day. ",

I decide to go downstairs to a cooler 60 degrees and sleep on the couch. Before  I explain the rest, it was late at night, 2AM, and my family was already asleep. \nSo, I turn the small tower fan in my room off, shut the door, and go downstairs. I used the bathroom, washed my hands, got a glass of sunny-D, put the glass in the sink, and laying down on the couch with my favorite blanket and pillow. \nNow, this probably sounds like a sleepwalking case, but I assure you, it isn't. I couldn't have fallen asleep in my room because I literally turned off my Xbox, sat down on my bed, and decided it was time to go downstairs. I then did all of those things.\nOnce again, I wake up and the door to the stairwell in my house was shut, as was the door to my room, which was also locked! My fan was off, and my glass was in the sink right where I had left it.\nThis freaked me out so much for a few reasons: Things like this have happened before, however minor; and my favorite blanket was on top of me when I awoke. I woke up drenched in sweat, and felt awful. I am honestly afraid to sleep anywhere but my bed. Can anyone explain this to me?",

The chair was red with flowery patterns. Pretty strange design. Whenever I sat in this chair I would be swirling around the room or I would see the room as upside down. It was always something strange and it felt like a parallel universe. It wasn't normal. Now that I'm older I thought it was my imagination as a child, but it isn't. My brother took that chair to college and he never sits in it. He said something along the lines of \"it's a great and comfortable, but I can't sit in it. I just don't like it, it makes me feel strange, I don't know what it is.\" \n\nThe chair is gone out of the family now. I don't know what was wrong with the chair, but it was definitely paranormal. \n\n",

Here's some back story to my life around this time: I was in a serious relationship and hardly saw any of my friends. I woke up one morning and thought I had one of the weirdest dreams ever. I called my friend and explained the dream to her. I told her that I was at some house playing Xbox 360 while drinking some beer. I'm playing the game, a basketball one, and in come 3 girls through the door. One of the girls wants to play and I say sure. There we are playing the game, talking and drinking. She ends up beating me and then she kisses me. Once I finished telling my friend the dream, I tell her that I have no idea why I would dream something like that. We laugh about me playing Xbox360 because I play PS3, and I never played a basketball game. Now around 6 months later, two of my friends end up getting an apparent together. They had kickbacks and people over mostly every night. I didn't see my friends at all. It was just my girlfriend and I the whole time. I decided to go out and check out my friends' new place. When I got there, all my friends were hanging out and having a good time. I was happy to see them. I then went into the living room and picked up a controller. My friend told me to play but that he only had one game: a basketball game. At this point, I'm oblivious to what's happening. I'm having fun. So, I'm there playing trying to learn this game and in come 3 girls. The one said that she wanted to play. I replied sure. We started playing and talking. I noticed she was very flirty. I then got a weird flashback of a feeling that this happened already. And it had. I dreamt it. In my dream, she ends up kissing me after she beats me. I'm trying hard to win and end up losing. I look at her and got up and left. I didn't say bye to anyone. I went home and I was a bit scared. My girlfriend asked how the night went and I told her it was fun. I never mentioned my dream to her. \n\nSorry for the long story and grammar. I'm officially 10 minutes late. I need to go clock back in. ",

They were my closest and oldest friends, and my mother even trusted them to \"babysit\" me for a few minutes at a time. They'd always keep me in the yard and make sure I didn't get into trouble. They let me use them as horses and tolerated me drawing on them with markers. I was homeschooled my entire life, so those dogs were quite literally some of my only and best friends.\n\nDuke was a cheerful, silly dork of a black lab, and when I was around 10 years old he was an old man. He was blind, deaf, and spent the majority of his days laying on the floor wagging his tail and grinning at nothing in particular. I spent HOURS with Duke - I'd use him as a pillow while I read books and dressed him up for various sessions of make believe. So when he fell ill due to old dog cancer, it was pretty devastating.\n\nDuke went downhill fast. It was my first experience with mortality and death, and it was scary. But I knew he was suffering, and I knew it was his time. One cold spring night Duke wasn't doing particularly well, so my parents banished me to the upstairs while they put an IV in him in the garage and hoped for the best. I was sitting in the loft reading a book, cuddling with Daisy and our new Chocolate Labrador Nessie, when something compelled me to look up from the pages. There was Duke, coming from the stairs, wagging his tail and grinning at me in his usual manner. \n\nConfused, I closed my book and watched as he walked into my dark bedroom, turning to look at me one time before he trotted into the blackness. I got up and went into my bedroom, flipping on the light switch, and Duke was nowhere to be found. A profound sadness overcame me, and I called out: \"Duke?\"\n\nAt that moment my mother opened the garage door and in a choked, sobbing voice yelled up to me: \"Molly, we just lost Duke. Come say goodbye.\"",

I drive along and a few moments later when I get to the intersection, I see the SAME CAR pull up, slow down, and make the same left turn driving away from me. It was literally the same exact scene I had just lucidly witnessed maybe 15 seconds earlier. Same car, same detail, same timing, etc. The car was totally unassuming and I don't know why it happened. There were no other cars on the road. I felt totally normal, not like the hazy feeling you sometimes get with Déjà vu, when you know your brain is playing tricks on you. This time my mind was totally clear and cognizant. I knew what I was seeing.\n\nTo this day I still think about it and wonder what it was.\n\nEDIT: Talking about this more has jogged my memory. Perhaps I should be more specific. When I say 'saw' I mean, in my mind's eye, I visualized the event before it happened. THEN I physically saw it. When it happened, I kind of felt like I knew I was seeing the future. I'm sorry if this sounds really weird, the whole thing is very strange to me and I can't make sense of it.\n",

        "text": "* Some Background Before this starts:\n\nI was raised in the little place in North Idaho, pretty much all woods and lots of lakes. Lived with my mom until 8-9 then moved in with my grandparents who I saw every weekend. My mother was not the best ( she was nice never mean) but lets just say \" Not on the right path \" in and out of jail. But all considering life wasn't bad. \n\n* The Start:\nSo 2nd grade is when things started to get weird. It all started with something that I saw in my kitchen making food ( I cooked for myself a lot since my mom wasnt \"Up to it\"). There was a huge thunder and lightning storm going on and a lightning bolt plain as day struck the field next to my house ( there was a park with a large soccer field in my back-yard). It scarred me so bad that I ran up to my room and jumped in bed and fell asleep ( after awhile ). So I woke up around 7:15pm... Thinking it was morning because of the sun I rushed and got ready to go! Then all of a sudden my mom yells and asks me where I am going, and I said \" School\" she told me it was night and it blew my mind. So a little while goes by and I don't remember much ( a lot of second hand \"stuff\"). Moved in with my grandparents in 3rd grade and started normally. Then I started having these real weird dreams, where I couldn't wake up... Like my brain was awake and I could tell, but I was stuck! Literally the scariest thing in my life. So then I taught myself how to wake up from these( What I know now is a Night Terror ) I had to scare myself awake by just kinda like jumping ( or moving my eyes funny ). Then one night, I was sitting in bed for hour or two ( Like usual since this made me scared to sleep ) I looked at my window which was pretty much a peep hole 5 or 6 feet up and probably 24length x 12in High... and I swear to this day I saw a face. Someone was peeping in on me, this still gives me chills to this day. So I rushed got up and woke up my grandma and told her about the person ( Or thing ) that looked in on me. We looked outside turned on the lights and didn't see anything, so they called me a \"woos\" told me to go back to sleep. Well I finally fell asleep and had crazy dreams ( I had taught myself how not to have nightmares by thinking of specific dreams when things come on, usually cupcakes ) . Then I started having Night Terrors again... But my trick to wake up wasnt working, but these were different, I was always by my house ( There was a public dock down the road, and I had a beach and a lake  right out front not a big lake but it was decent enough for boating ). There was always something in the sky, or something to do with the sky in these dreams... and I could tell the faces of people very very distinctly. I was always trying to save people but I could not. There would I always appear this figure ( Pretty sure the thing from my window ). And it would chase me till it could corner me in my own house. It would beat me up ( I could feel all of ) and I would never wake up then it would just stand there in front of me. But here is the weirdest part.... Since I was conscious ( at least my brain was aware of my outsides ) I could hear my grandparents talking about the news and cooking breakfast and all that. The when I finally woke up I would go out in the kitchen and they were there cooking breakfast and talking about the news. Then these dreams/night terrors got so real that I would have full days in them, I would start to pass out on the couch and have them. Where my night terror would be like to universe colliding, I knew I was laying on the couch but at the same time I felt as if I was getting up and walking into the kitchen, to only all of a sudden be back asleep on the couch..... Then after this happened on a regular basis it all just stopped I had a major panic attack when I was in 6th grade in mid day, I kinda dosed off sitting on the couch and pictured the whole universe just ending, and it was everything Time, Existence... Just ending and it scared me... then from that day on I never had a dream with this \" Thing\" in it again... No more dreams of recognizable people. But I still had the occasional cant move in my sleep ( usually I was just super tired from practice or something ) but it was very rare. Its been probably 2 years since anything remotely like that. Last summer I was visiting my grandparents when my grandma asked me this \" Do you remember when you sleep talked? \" I was like no... ( In my night terrors I never ever remember talking ( which scared the shit out of me, I couldnt speak )\" She said \" You used to yell HELP ME GRANDMA! HELP! \" and I never have any recognition of this ever! But the weird part is this she said my eyes were open so she thought since I was afraid of the dark I was just trying to get her attention....\n\n* recent:\nSometimes when I wake up I have to immediately eat or shower or do something strange like count my clock or repeatedly check my phone to make sure I am actually awake.\n\n\n**TL;DR Randomly started having Night Terrors and Sleep Paralysis, Stopped as quick as it started!**",

Otherwise, I'd say my brain just likes to work against me.\n\nI spent the night at my friend's house, let's call her Summer with my other friend Marie. I have always hated Summer's house because I have an unrational fear of ghosts and she loves to tell me tales about the benevolent beings in her house. Especially in the attic, where her new room is. \n\nWe turn in relatively early, around 12 because we have a festival to go to in the morning. Now, because of my fears and weird dreams, I ALWAYS try to sleep with noise and light otherwise my dreams go from weird to /r/nosleep worthy. So, I feel slightly comfortable, being that I'm sleeping in the same room as Marie on a couch and Summer is in the very next room. I have a clear view of the only entrance to the attic(very important to my paranoia) and Marie can clearly see Summer's door. Which is closed. Note this.\n\nBoth the girls fall asleep and I get freaked out as usual so I turn on the TV in that room and turn down the volume out of courtesy. I feel better and eventually fall asleep. I continually have to get up every two hours or so to change the channel, because if I don't the TV turns to static. Once, I remember regaining consciousness, sitting up, turning the lamp on and turning the TV back ON. I just walked over and did my thing once again. I just suspected that Marie turned if off, when I sat down her eyes opened and I simply apologized and got back in bed, and turned off the lamp. Soon the sun went up and I felt much better.\n\nNothing weird happened. Till Marie told me what she saw. She said she woke up from the static and saw that I wasn't on the couch anymore. She was so damn comfy she decided to wait until I came back so rather that get up herself to turn off the TV. She said she waited for like 10 minutes and I didn't return. She dismissed it knowing I'm paranoid and probably crawled into bed with Summer, she gets up and turns off the TV. It's pitch black now and she decides to wait up abit longer to see if I return. Next thing she knows I'm standing up, turning on the lamp and turning on the TV. I sit back down. Apologize. And turn off the lamp.\n\nNever do I remember getting off the couch or walking around her house. Over and over, I asked Marie if she was actually awake and she said yes. However, she doesn't know where I came from. I even asked Summer and her mother if they saw me that night and both said no. They being light sleepers and I've been known to have late night discussions with her mom.\n\nOne thing that bothers me the most is that I remember the feeling of raising up the top part of my body to turn on the lamp. But Marie insists I was standing. I don't like my brain telling me lies. Or Marie's.\n\nTL;DR I slept walk SOMEWHERE while I was at a haunted friend's house. Hopefully.",

        "text": "I just posted this in a thread about personal mysteries which led me to finding this subreddit.  Figured it may get more traction here due to relevance and I'd really be interested to hear any similar stories. \n\nWhen I was young I was notorious for trying my damndest to catch Santa Claus delivering gifts on Christmas. It wasn't that I doubted his existence, I just wanted to meet the man. Even after I'd be put to bed, usually supervised to make sure I was asleep, I would usually wake up and run out to the tree to see if he had come yet. One year when I was maybe 5 and my sister 7, my parents got us big kid bicycles. The bicycles were kept next door in our neighbor's garage until Christmas eve because while I wanted to meet Santa my sister's Christmas vice was that she was the worst snooper and would look all over the house for hidden presents and the bikes would be too difficult to hide. That year they asked my Grandfather to come over and watch to make sure I didn't wake up while they were bringing in the bikes from next door.\n\nAll went according to plan and I managed to stay asleep during the night but when my eyes opened and I saw the sun already up I ran out to the living room and was so excited to see all of the presents under the tree and my new bike. We did the normal Christmas morning ritual, opened all the gifts, and then it was time for breakfast which was usually pancakes as a special treat.\n\nEven though my sister and I were both too old for it we still had a high chair in the kitchen pushed into the corner. On the seat of the high chair was a cassette tape/booklet combo of [Mickey Mouse Disco](http://imgur.com/6Pm29pq). It was unwrapped but still in the plastic. I grabbed it and brought it to my Mom and asked her if it was for me. She looked at it confused and said she guessed so, but she didn't have any idea where it came from. I had guessed that maybe Santa had forgotten to wrap it and left it in the kitchen because he was running late or since the kitchen was between the room where we had the tree and the room where the fire place was he dropped it by mistake on his way back up the chimney. I overheard my parents discussing where it came from which is something that stuck with me because to a child it was obviously from Santa so why would they question this one gift over any of the others.\n\nWhen I was older, past the age of knowing Santa wasn't real, I brought it up again and got more information about from my parents. They questioned my Grandfather about it when he came back on Christmas day and thought he must have left it there. He didn't, and it wasn't in his personality to let a joke go on for years, even if he had. Nor was it in my Mom's or my Dad's personality to have never fessed up to it if it had been a joke one of them played on the other. So to this day there's still no explanation where that Mickey Mouse Disco cassette tape came from. But I played the hell out that tape as a kid.\n",

The door slams, i hear him yell hey, i yell hey back, nothing out of the ordinary. Then, i hear a pop. Like the kind when you go on a plane or in the mountains. I ask my dad what he brought home for dinner, and there's silence. I ask again, with no reply. i go downstairs and look for him, but he's not inside. i thought \" oh he must be just getting stuff from his car\" and i opened my garage door. His car wasn't even there. I was freaked the fuck out and called my dad. He was still at work, 45 minutes away at a military base. \n**tl;dr** I thought my dad was home and talked to him, when he wasn't there. ",

The first is rather small, I can predict when I am going to get a phone call or text and will be reaching for my phone before it ever rings or vibrates. Not such a big deal but it still makes me think. The next thing is that I will be thinking about a movie that I haven't seen in years, like some shitty movie that should for no reason be relevant. Then within 2-3 hours I will find it on TV playing. And its not something I can just be like oh hey I wanna see this movie, boom its on. A movie scene, title, or quote will pop into my head at random and without any context and then the movie will be on TV. This freaks me out more than anything and makes me wonder what the hell is going on. No DVR or on screen guide, no TV guide so there is no real way I could have seen the schedule somewhere else. There are a few other smaller things with me remembering things that wasnt from my memory but are from my parents memories. I will describe something and my dad will be like I've never told you about that how did you know I did this or that when I was a kid? or something insignificant.\n**TL;DR I can predict phone calls, texts, television programming, and remember things that happened long before I was born.**",

        "text": "Well, just a few months ago I went to Cuba. There was no English TV and no internet that i could use and yet I had a dream. This dream was full of detail and i thought it was so original that i was going to write a book about it as soon as i returned to Canada. In the dream i was infected by a fast-acting plague while walking outside of a library in my hometown and blacked out. When i awoke i was in a crowded funeral home in line to be burnt in a cremator. Void of rational thought, i could only feel a ravenous hunger. Me, and several other seemingly \"dead\" bodies leapt out of our coffins and set upon the mourners, biting and scratching them with super-human strength. I then bit the ministers wife before he bashed me over the head with a crucifix. When i came too a second time i saw my family as well as my crush cornered by the undead and my fever broke. I started to tear the corpses apart savagely, using my recovered intelligence and my newly received strength, to outsmart and outmaneuver them, getting the remainders away from my family. As they are lead away one of the pipes full of gas for the cremator bursts, spraying fire throughout the building. Using a piece of the pipe as a club I am able to incapacitate all of the zombies surrounding me and make my way back to my family, leading them safely out of the building now engulfed in flame. The rest of the dream is inconsequential, although it still pertains to the basic idea. Anyway, upon arriving home i quickly found out that an almost identical idea, under different circumstances is the plot of the movie \"warm bodies\", a movie about how a zombie is able to slowly become human again to save someone he loves. You may not find much connection between the two but from my point of view they are very similar.",

I'm not the most articulate person, so I'm just going to try to get across what I'm pretty sure I experienced before.\n\nMy mom and I used to go on rides a lot in our Dodge Neon. This had to be around the late nineties or early 2000s, and I was six or so. I used to look out the window for entertainment. I remember in the next town over I'd used to see this little shack that almost seemed like a farm stand. It had trusses and framing around it, with a little shack in the center. I remember seeing workmen building it a few times.\n\nA few years later, and a change of custody, my dad and I drove by the area, and it surprised me how old and decrepit it looked. The lot was completely grown over, and the wood seemed dilapidated to the point of nearly collapsing. This was surprising because it had only been three or so years since I saw it being built. I wish I remembered more about it, but that's one of my main experiences with a \"glitch\".\n\nI'm pretty sure my dad told me about a similar occurrence. He's a carpenter, and he's worked in a lot of old houses. He told me about a time he was working in this old house, and when on break, he saw it as it was in it's prime. The old wall-paper, furnishings, everything. I'm going to ask him more about it when he gets home.",

        "text": "Hi everyone, first topic in this subreddit, bear with me (or bare with me as I recently learned I used this word wrong for 27 years)\n\nWhen I was a kid, absolutely every time I wanted to fall asleep, I had to imagine a certain thing. It was a HUGE disk shaped floor like thing that would slide under me (I always pictured myself flying when I closed my eyes). This thing was immense and I never got to see the actual size of it, as by the time the first half of the said disk would slide under me I would fall asleep. It was a very light brown color full of circular lines running all the way around it. I remember using this every time I wanted to sleep fast (took me about 30 seconds after I started imagining this to actually falling asleep). \n\nAfter this, my parents used to tell me that I would wake up in the morning or after my nap, and start telling them how I traveled in my invisible car to a distant city and worked there. It was a thing that went on for years yet my parents didn't do anything about this other than be amused and remind me every now and again. I never ever remember said invisible car, dreaming about going to work anywhere OR telling them anything about this. EVER! Yet they claimed I always did this. Please note that this started when I was about 5 years old and then after 3-4 years my parents stopped talking about this so I figured my \"sleeptalking\" stopped as well.. \n\nAs a side note, deja-vu's are a regular part of my life, and not a day goes by without me going like \"fk, I can swear that already happened before\" and VERY rarely I remember those things exactly before they happen. My most incredible deja-vu yet was saving a friend from being hit by a car that was speeding from behind the corner. 15-20 seconds before we saw the car I pulled him as he tried to cross the street and just said \"WAIT!\" I was maybe 12-14... I don't remember exactly, but this left a very deep encrusted memory in my brain. ",

I'm riding in a car from my grandma's house to my house, and my older brother notices a cowboy hat in my grandpa's car, and my grandpa lets him have it.\n\nI know this part of my day really happened. The rest is even foggier in my memory. My brother and mom both left the house. I decided to wear the cowboy hat and go play outside. For some reason I can't figure out, I grabbed a VCR of home videos from a drawer on my way out. \n\nWhen I went outside, around 3 PM, I met up with one of my friends and a few people he was with that I didn't know. The wind seemed to pick up out of nowhere and there was a lot of leaves and dirt being pushed around. I don't really remember anything from the next few minutes. Next thing I know, I  wind gets really strong and I just faint and fall but I don't really remember hitting the floor.\n\nI wake up in my bed at home, around 5 PM. My mom is in the kitchen cooking something, and I look around the house for the hat and VCR and both of them are missing. The whole thing is really creeping me out at this point and I don't even ask my mom about it, but she, or anyone else, never mentions anything about it. \n\nShortly after I forgot about the whole thing, but when I came back to the house after living in the US for 5 years I happened to find the VCR while looking through drawers.\n\nTLDR: Passed out and lost somethings on a very mysterious day. The whole thing seems like it never happened but it felt too real. Later found one of the things I lost in the same place it always was. ",

She woke up immediately and found nobody in the room. At the same moment my brother had an accident with his motorcycle and we found out that only later.\n\nOn another occasion, my grandfather was in bed, some days before dying, and he told us he dreamt of his older brother, and that he said to him that they would meet soon and not to worry. The fact is that we hadn't told to my grandfather that his brother died only few days earlier. My grandfather died a week later.\n\nA really scary things is that for a couple of months after the death of my grandfather I kept dreaming of him, I was unaware in the dream that he was dead, but he kept telling me that where he was, he was happy. The last time he said he really had to go, but that we would have met again in about (and here I can't remember clearly) 20-30 years. I was 15, now I'm 31. I haven't dreamt of him anymore since.\n\nWhen I was younger I usually had vivid deja-vus that would span from a couple of seconds to several dozens of seconds. I would recall the dreams in the morning but don't know what they meant since they had no context. After some time the deja-vu would happen exactly as I dreamed them, even the long sequences, and I could clearly remember the day I dreamt them as the pieces finally got together.\n\nOnce I got to 15 yo, those deja-vus became really frequent and each one was very long, I could remember entire conversations rolling up before me, so I decided: fuck this, I don't want to play a script and I started to not to do what happened in my dreams. After that moment I started having deja-vu of things that didn't happen. An alternate reality in which, I assume, things went as they were supposed to. I was in a place where I was supposed to be, but different things were happening, I was with different people, and at the same time I had the clear memory of the deja-vu.\n\nThen things got even more complicated, as I started having 2 different deja-vu of the same event, the first from the \"original\" line, and the second that was the new story line. After a while I tried to get away from the second line too, but then a third line of deja-vus opened, letting me see three different story lines for the same things.\n\nThese deja-vus are now less frequent and more apart from each other, but still happen from time to time.\n\n**TL:DR: Dreams in my family are really weird and changing things from deja-vus lead only to more deja-vus, you can't escape. Also, I may die at the age of 35 of 45.**\n",

        "text": "This is an old story, but I never figured out a decent explanation, and it bothers me to this day. I just found this sub and I think it fits here.\n\nWhen I was about 9, my brother and I were flying paper airplanes around the living room. We never opened the windows in the summer because we had central air, and lived in the desert, so all the windows and doors in the house were closed. Our windows were single pane, but there were two of them, so basically you had the interior window with a spring-loaded latch, then an open space between it and the exterior window of about 3 inches. I guess it was like, a precursor to double paned windows or something.\n\nSo I threw my paper airplane and it curved sharply to the right, went around the wall into the dining room (a few feet away), and when I ran after it, I couldn't find it anywhere. The rooms in that house were really small--it was a 14 foot wide mobile home, so there really couldn't have been any place it could have gone that I wouldn't have seen it. I crawled out from under a table and looked up at the window and flipped out, because it was actually in between the two closed windows, nose down. I had to call my mom and brother in to look at it to make sure I wasn't hallucinating or something, and I remember slapping my hand on the glass. I had to actually work the spring-loaded latch and open the window to get it back out.\n\nIdeas? This has been bothering me for almost twenty years.",

It's only for a split second.  The vision is of a flat, fork-like, metal utensil being jammed into my top  row of teeth.  Instead of being jammed in from the front of my mouth, the \"fork\" is coming from the direction of the back of my throat.  The prongs of this \"fork\" are tightly hugging my teeth in the divot where the teeth meet the gums.  Then the \"fork\" is twisted and the vision ends.  \n\nImmediately I feel uneasy/anxious and inclined to grimace my face and this feeling lasts until I can take my mind off it.  Simply typing this up is giving me the feeling just as strong as when the vision happens.  \n\nOutside of the occasional lucid dream, I don't have a history of shit like this.

My entire family had noticed I was nowhere to be found for a few hours. My dad in his bellowing voice screamed my name, my mom and sister rummaged through the house looking for me. Tearing the covers, sheets, pillows off of every bed. Looking in cabinets, closets, bathrooms, under sinks, you name it. I was 14 so I could not have driven myself anywhere. So they called 911 for a missing person.\n\nI was there, and then hours later to them it seemed i had been kidnapped. My dad ended up driving through the neighborhood looking on the side of the road, in ditches, wooded areas, etc.\n\nAll I remember after falling asleep in my sister's room was dazily walking down the stairs. My dad and mom and sister swear they tore every room upstairs apart. While screaming, calling, shouting my name. Threatening me if I didn't show up.

My head was patted. They do that when the metal detector senses it on your head (bobby pins, etc?).

His parents were cool with us using the place during the cold months, but when it warmed up and they used the pool they also used the pool house in order to throw parties and such. After one Such party, we were given the task of cleaning up the pool house in order to have our band practice there later that day. We spent a good 3 hours cleaning up, it was an awful mess. We had to mop and wipe up everything, someone had spilled some Sunkist or something, and we had to collect all of the garbage. While we worked, we just talked about dumb things like girls and music. When we were finally done, we each grabbed one of the huge industrial sized garbage bags (these people *really* like to party) an stepped outside of the pool house to go dispose of them. We were deep in discussion about a new band's album that had just come out, and we never discussed a place to dispose of these bags. So we stepped outside of the pool house an then... That was it. The conversation never missed a beat, it never halted or stalled but all of a sudden we were in front of the pool house without any garbage bags. I didn't even notice they were gone at first, until he asked me 'wait, what did we do with that trash?'\n\nI genuinely didn't know. \n\nWe assumed we had just gotten lost in conversation and had put them somewhere, so we started looking. They were nowhere to be found. Absolutely no where. \n\nI just texted him to confirm this story, and even though it happened over a year ago and we don't even speak any more, he says he still remembers it clearly because it was so weird. \n\nIs this a glitch or some sort of shared hallucination or what?

        "text": "So this is a 100% true story that I have never told anyone because I didn't want to be thought of as crazy.  To be honest, I thought I was going crazy myself and that is a horrible feeling.  Reading some of the stories here have made me feel better but also slightly terrified all over again.\n\nA year and a half ago I went on a bicycle trip by myself from Boston to Seattle.  Now I don't know if this is relevant information or not, but in the two weeks before I left there were a lot of strange coincidences that all complicated my life and made me question whether or not to even go on the trip.  As I list them now I feel silly... like it is irrelevant.  I can't deny, though, that at the time I felt like the universe was trying to stop me.  I had to replace my phone and a few parts of my bike that suddenly broke.  My backpack got ruined in the worlds smallest electrical fire in my apartment.  The guy who was subletting my room couldn't pay me until I had already left because his credit union leaked a bunch of credit card numbers and they had to freeze his account.  At the time it just seemed like too much.  My friends and family know about this stuff, though. \n\nWhat they don't know is that in the time leading up to this I was getting very interested in [simulation theory.](http://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html)  You guys should all be familiar with that paper, to be honest.  But anyway I just had a nagging feeling that something was wrong for a long time.  Here's where it gets weird.\n\nWhen I was 37 days into my ride (I kept a journal) I was in the middle of North Dakota.  At this point I was in the best shape of my life and I was confident in changing flats and carrying enough food and water.  I was pretty much cruising.  It was so flat that I was averaging about 100 miles a day and my days felt way easier than going through hilly New York state at the beginning.  The only problem was that there was flooding in Minot that summer and all of the motels were packed full of flood refugees.  Not a problem, my tent worked fine.\n\nDay 37 was pretty minimal in terms of my interaction with other people.  It was a day where I had camped the night before and would camp again that evening.  You have to picture what it looks like out there, flat as a desktop and wheat fields everywhere.  the As I was riding on route 2 at about 3:30 pm that day, I hit a patch of locusts.  It's pretty crazy to ride through these things, it had happened to me before, though.  Just thousands and thousands of these grasshoppers all standing around on the road.  Of course they are in the fields on either side of the road too, but you only notice them when they are on the road.  The thing is, when you get close to them on the bike they jump up out of your way.  The other thing is, they don't actually jump out of your way, they just jump randomly.  Into your legs as often as away from you.\n\nSo as I'm cruising along, these things start to jump all over the place as I am passing them.  I had seen this before, and I am completely not afraid of bugs.  The sheer number makes it a little worse, though, but all in all the bugs themselves don't bother me.  They were accumulating in my shoes from jumping into my legs and falling down, but I was going to wait until I cleared the patch to shake them out.  They don't jump high enough to hit me in the face, so it's really no worry as I cruise through them.  Until, that is, I start to notice the pattern.  With my eyes on the road ahead of me, I can see the locusts jumping up out of the way.  The thing is, I notice that what I am seeing is the **exact** same thing over and over again.  I mean I am seeing a small locust jump low to the left, a big locust high to the right, I feel 2 taps on my left leg, 1 tap on the right leg, one locust jumps right into my wheel, and then it all repeats itself.  I catch onto the pattern subconsciously at first, but then my inner monologue starts to say each thing as it happens, and suddenly I am saying out loud \"1-2...3...1-2...3\" and tapping on my handle bars in this sort of rhythm, and I become completely aware that I am going through a texture that was never supposed to be observed like this.  Remember the locust that gets caught in my wheel every time?  I stop in the middle of the swarm and step off of my bike.  I look at my front wheel and there is a golf ball sized pile of grasshoppers bunched up in one spot between two spokes.  There are no other locusts in the front wheel.\n\nI throw my leg over the bike to continue going through the pattern and all of the sudden I'm not on the road anymore.  I am surrounded by wheat about 20 feet off the side of the road.  It seems so strange that I didn't throw up or something at the time.  I don't know why.  I just pulled my leg back off of the bike and walked my bike back to the road.  My bike is heavy with my bags, even when I'm not on it.  It leaves a track when I walk it to the road.  There was no track to the spot I was at.  I was so disoriented that I wasn't sure which side of the road I was on.  It's easy though, in the afternoon, just go towards the sunset.  I remember saying out loud \"OK, now, which side are going to be on?\"",

I was four,and mum and I were visiting a large city. We trying to find an old friend of hers house, and it was starting to rain. \n\nWe were walking along, and I randomly look down an alley way and say 'The man's gone, mummy.' Mum looks, there's a random bogan hobo asleep on the ground. She pulls me past it, and we pass the next alley way. 'The man's back, mummy.'\n\nThere was no one there. \n\nFeeling sufficiently creeped out, mum and I eventually find the house, and we spend a few hours there. Because it is raining, the friend offers to drive us back. In the car, we are driving along when I say 'Mummy, do you see the monster?' When mum looks out the window, the hobo is walking along the side of the road.\n\n\nThis sufficiently creeped us both out when she brought it up again when I was 16.",

I'm not even sure if it qualifies as a glitch, but man was it weird.  \n\nI had just parked my car and was walking across the parking lot to class, and off to my left I hear some noise, loud but not alarming, you know?  Rather than turn my head to identify the sound, some fucking muscles that don't exist tried to activate behind and below my left ear to rotate it toward the sound.  Like I was a damn dog or something.  It was completely subconscious, I could literally feel nerves firing for muscles that didn't exist, had never existed, will never exist and I subconsciously knew were the 'rotate the ear' muscles.  My conscious brain of course was going 'BZUH, WOT??'  \n\nAs soon as it was all over (which, seriously was probably like 1/60th of a second; it was just a reflex) and the world didn't stop or anything, I just shook my head and laughed about it.  I still have no idea what happened there, but it was completely, totally, not under my control in any way.  I never did identify what the sound was, I was so conf/amused, I just went to class without ever checking.",

        "text": "I'm not sure if this was a glitch in reality or simply a case of extraordinary animal intelligence, but here's my story. Four or five years ago, I was visiting my family in New Orleans. I was with my family, and we were staying at my grandparents' house. My grandfather, parents, brothers and myself all went to pay a visit to my aunt and uncle who lived across town. My aunt and uncle had a dog named Barnie, a grizzled old black Scottish Terrier who was probably around 16 or 17 at the time. Anyway, we were all sitting around in the family room, chatting about work, life, etc. Eventually the conversation moved to the topic of Barnie. We talked about his health issues and his diet (homemade Cuban food) and were generally surprised that he had lived as long as he had. \n\nAt this point, my grandfather commented on the gate to the yard being open on our way in, and asked if my uncle was worried that Barnie would get out. My uncle said nah, he wanders the neighborhood all the time, we're not too worried about him. My grandfather was surprised at this, and noted that Barnie wasn't even wearing a collar. Before my uncle could even respond, Barnie casually lifted his head to expose the collar that was hiding under his fur. We were stunned. Nobody had made any move towards him or called his attention; he simply lifted his head to show his collar, then put it back down and continued snoozing. Sadly, Barnie died later that year but no one in my family will ever forget the time we glimpsed his surprising human intelligence.",

        "text": "So this happened to me my freshman year of college (about 2 years ago). I've never thought much about it, I always just considered it a lapse in memory or something of that sort. But to this day I'm still not sure what exactly I saw.\n\nMy freshman year I was living in a dorm on campus. My room was on the 3rd floor, and I had a two-room double, which basically means I had a roommate, and we shared a small common area, but we each had our own rooms.\n\nBack then I liked to study at my desk, which faced the one window in my room. Sitting there, I had a good, broad view of the one-way street in front of my window. \n\nOne day I was studying at my desk as usual, reading over some textbook. As I often do while studying, I looked up for a second to give myself a little break from the wall of text; and I saw across the street a man, middle-aged, perhaps a bit older (late 50's-early 60's). He was on the opposite side of the street, getting ready to cross. I can't recall seeing anyone else crossing the street or even being on the sidewalk, though it's fully possible there might have been; regardless, I honed in on this guy for some reason.\n\nAnyway, I watched the man start crossing, and he got about halfway across the street when my attention waned and I shifted my focus back to the book I was reading. Barely a second later, and I don't know why I did this, I looked up again from my book at the same spot I had seen the guy walking toward, and he was nowhere to be seen.\n\nNow, the street in front of my window was fairly wide - about thirty feet I would say, and the guy reached the middle of the road when I looked away. He was walking rather slowly, and perfectly perpendicular to the road. I looked away for one or two seconds, tops, and when I looked back, I couldn't see the guy at all--not on the sidewalk, or anywhere else along the road or on either side. From the third story, my window gave me a pretty wide view of the street, and there were no bushes or trees or cars obstructing my view. I was so unnerved by this seemingly minor incident that to this day it still sticks out in my mind as one of the weirdest glitches I've experienced.",

        "text": "My first clear memory of when I was a child is the day I lost my favorite stuffed animal. I threw an absolute fit, wailed around and wouldn't give my parents a break until they helped me find that fucking dog. We tore the house apart room by room for hours, and long story short, I went back to my room in defeat and saw the stuffed dog sitting dead center in the middle of my neatly made bed (which was not normal). Of course that fact flew right over my head, I was insanely happy and ran back to my parents to thank them for finding the toy.\n\nI was speaking with my mother today about life's oddities in general and she brought up this incident. I was surprised, since the memory was so clear in my head, that I had never thought to ask the obvious questions, like why didn't they just tell me they had found it to shut me the hell up? It sure as shit wasn't just sitting there before when we were tearing up my room.\n\nMy mom told me that her and my dad had gotten into a fight that night because she hadn't found the dog, and my dad wouldn't admit to it, either. She said it was the second time he'd messed with her and scaring us like that wasn't funny.\n\nOf course, I phoned my dad for his side of the story. My dad is a serious man when the time comes for it, and his honest answer was that he didn't know what had happened. He was just irritated that my mother and I had wasted his entire Sunday looking for a stupid toy.\n\nI went back to my mom and asked about this \"second time\" comment. When I was a baby, I would cry and cry for hours on end. One night, my mother hadn't slept in well over a day. She couldn't find either of my pacifiers and my toy boxes were in storage along with most of our things, because they had just moved into a new apartment (and my dad wasn't even present for this incident). She told me I had been crying non stop all night long, but when she came out of the bathroom down the hallway and she did not hear my cries from the living room. She ran over terrified to see what had caused me to stop so abruptly.\n\nThere next to me, on the floor, was one of those vibrating toy balls with the rubber feet. It was turned on, lightly bouncing around, my head turned and eyes curiously watching.\n\nIs there a super hero time traveler out there giving parents a goddamn break? Was there a glitch in the matrix? Did a timeline where I had more toys cross over to the timeline where my parents were broke? Was it a fucking ghost? I don't know, but... thank you.",

(I'm a big fan of horror movies and have quite a good memory of the shows I've watched). I went to check its release date and found out that it was released in the states one+month before the release in my country.  Thus, it was impossible that I've seen the movie so soon on HBO. \n\nThinking that I has probably remembered the wrong movie, I bought the tickets for the movie and went ahead with it. Not even halfway through the show, I realised it was the exact plot, right down to even the characters' names.\n\nA friend told me this happened sometimes.. a movie would sometimes be released a few years earlier in its home country before being premiered abroad. I went back to double check the release date again, which was indeed only one month ago.\n\nhas anyone else experienced something like that?? Or was it really my memory playing tricks on me??",

This story happened to me when I was in the 7th grade (8 or 9 years ago) and I this is the best place I know to share it.\n\n\nEveryone in my 7th grade math class were assigned the same books (obviously), they were the same type/publisher as [this guy](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JW88v1aBJCk/T1qWtPDzf3I/AAAAAAAAAKs/UvfeuhFAyJ0/s1600/alg-geometry.jpg), although some lower level math stuff, the ones we had were meant for 7th graders. They were sort of interactive books, really story-based when it came to the problem sets with lots of illustrations and stuff to help us kids understand better. Usually, assignments were a few pages long, so there would be blocks of text with illustrations nearby over 3-4 pages. These drawings were scattered around the page spread, but always near enough to the story that you knew which drawing applied to which problem. I distinctly remember doing a problem set in class one day when I came across an illustration near the middle of the spread that just didn't make any sense. It depicted a redhead girl in jeans and a shortsleeve button-up plaid shirt. She was facing forwards, eyes closed, pulling the bottom of her shirt tails apart, the buttons of the shirt flying off as she was pulling. I thought it must relate to some problem coming up, but as I looked around and then slowly perused every problem, not a single one applied to this illustration. I pointed it out to a friend, but he didn't seem to care. I have always wondered how exactly that got into our math books/how the illustrator got it past publishers.",

Lights remained off (as was the setting it had been shut off with). I had JUST engaged the power for the fixture and it was suddenly going on top speed.
