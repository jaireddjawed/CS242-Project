Graduated in chemeng in Australia. Worked as a grad mining engineer in coal for 1 year. Trying to find a job in Melbourne as partner is there.\n\nThree offers are:\n- Grad engineer at a company producing flotation equipment - travel 50% in 1st year - 25% onwards - permanent - $80k - 30min drive\n- Grad project engineer at a train manufacturing company - permanent - $86k - near home.\n\nThese are the best I in Melbourne as my partner is there. I really appreciate your opinion.\n\nThank u guys.",

        "text": "Context: \n\nI've been working in my current job as a Plastics Engineer for an aerospace manufacturer for 1 year and 8 months now. When I first hired on in April 2021, I was offered $60k salary and decent benefits/PTO. In December '21 I was given a 4% pay increase, and just a couple weeks ago I was given a 3% pay increase. Accounting for inflation, I'm making less now than I was when I started. At the same time, it's been made very clear by my supervisors that I fulfill all of the duties and responsibilities of my role very well. My major goal for this year was to take over NPI activities from my boss so he would have more bandwidth for bigger projects. Things like scheduling personnel, equipment, and resources and managing our whole process for producing proprietary plastics for us to make and sell parts with. I also handle inspection/characterization of these proprietary materials on a per lot basis.  \n\nWhen I was told I would be getting a 3% pay increase this year, I made it known that I felt I deserved more. I made reference to the above, and how those activities go beyond the job description I was hired for, that I function more as an Engineer II than an Engineer I, that I manage and bring more value now, etc. \n\nTheir response was that they feel I am paid enough, that I am at the range they have in mind for my position, and for me to make a move upward in compensation would require for an opening to come available above me, or for me to contribute so much to the company in my current role that they make a new role for me. \n\nI've got interest from another local aerospace manufacturer, and they want to interview me this week for an entry level Manufacturing Engineer position. My main question is, if they make me an offer, how would I know whether to accept or stay with my current job? How do you know when to jump ship?",

        "text": "I've always been curious, how do automotive engineers determine an engine's preferred oil viscosity during design? It's well understood that thinner oils provide less drag for more efficiency and offer better cold-weather flow, yet some cars to this day still require relatively thick 5w30 oil, whereas others are using 0w20, 0w16, or oddballs like 5w40 in some Euro cars.\n\nI've noticed some Euro manufacturers even offer a *range* of acceptable viscosities depending on the climate, which suggests that the \"best\" oil viscosity for an engine may be a concept with some nuance. Enthusiasts often have competing opinions on what the best viscosity for their particular car model is - usually with anecdotal rather than scientific evidence. Even the companies seem to have their own preferences - Ford was using 5w20 in everything at one point, whereas Chevy preferred 5w30 across most of its lineup for a long time.\n\nIs there a set of engineering parameters that is used to determine this? Or is this just some trial-and-error \"best guesstimate\" thing that each manufacturer weighs differently?",

Total time in the house was 10-15 minutes.\n\nI've never used a SE before, so maybe it's that easy to get all the relevant information, but hearing \"oops\" from someone who will be calculating how to keep my house structurally sound was disconcerting.\n\nAs a side note, how likely would it be that there are no interior load bearing walls on a roof span that size? There don't appear to be any supports or piers in the basement directly below any part of the two walls to be removed, so I'm having trouble visualizing how they are carrying and dispersing a load.\n\nThanks for any input.\n\nSide note: the contractor wants to deviate from the SE report and \"shave\" a small portion of the beam down so it will fit into the roof plane and avoid a small bump-out from the wall for a support post.

I'm very good at math and ELA and maybe it's a little dumb but I still can't understand why my friend (who is beyond horrible at math and flunked English twice) gets encouraged and all I get is questioned. So all that to say why? Why am I the only one who gets practically interrogated on why I want to be an engineer and he gets a pat on the back?",

        "text": "So I just got an offer for a summer internship that I am fairly interested in, only a day after interviewing for it. They put a deadline of December 23rd on accepting the offer. However, I'm in the process of interviewing for another position at NASA, which I would rather take for a few reasons: pay, the opportunity to move to California for the summer, and a few more minor ones. The interview is scheduled for the 20th.\n\nI've never been in this situation before, so I just wanted to ask: would it be weird to be honest with the first company and ask them to extend their offer until I have fleshed out all my options? In the same vein, would it also be acceptable to ask for an accelerated decision (&lt; 3 days) by NASA, so I can potentially weigh both opportunities as the same time? I feel like both these options make me look bad to the employer, but I don't really know what else to do in this situation.\n\nFor context on the nasa interview, I will potentially be working under a systems engineer there, and I feel like I have a very good chance getting the position as I've already been through a few steps of the interviewing / vetting process.",

My question is, are there any commercial camera systems that can be organized into an array? I want about 6-9 cameras for my photogrammetry setup, I don't need any rear LCDs or other consumer features. I need to be able to control all of the cameras at once with some kind of remote trigger. It would help if the cameras are compact, about the size of a go-pro. In fact, go-pros would be great but I don't think I can control them all at once. Any help would be appreciated, thank you.",

University of Houston - Victoria is cheaper and more convenient for me as it is closer to home but is a much smaller school.  I once drove by, and it looked like it consisted of only a few buildings.\n\nThis is a huge decision for me so I would like some opinions.
