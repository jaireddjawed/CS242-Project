        "text": "Hi, I'll (try) to keep it brief.\n\nI'm having trouble uploading an image to Wikipedia. \n\nI was asked to upload an image on behalf of its copyright holder. I followed the instructions Wikipedia provided by first uploading the image and tagging it accordingly. I then asked the copyright holder to release the copyright by sending an email to  [permissions-commons@wikimedia.org](mailto:permissions-commons@wikimedia.org) , using the template found here:  [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Email\\_templates](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Email_templates) \n\nThey got a response from the Volunteer Team asking who created the image and how they came to be the copyright holder of it. The owner of the image replied that they are the sole copyright holder (they are,  as previously stated), and that they took the photo themself (they did) , touching it up slightly in GIMP afterwards. \n\nThe Volunteer Team didn't think this was good enough though. They replied back with \"Please elaborate how you created the photograph by yourself\" and \"Please also provide the unprocessed original in full resolution for verification. \"\n\nThe copyright holder already explained how they took the photo. They used a still, timed camera, and then later touched it up in GIMP. The image that I uploaded was already of large size. \n\nWhy is the volunteer giving us such a hard time here? I've uploaded images on the behalf of others before without issue. Why are they asking to elaborate on how the image was taken? What else could we even say? Do they need the camera model? The room temperature? How high the camera was off the floor? \n\nWhy do they want a full size unedited image for \"verification\" purposes? \n\nI don't understand. I'm just lost here.",

        "text": "So i got into a rabbit hole and found two mentions of this event, one in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrospray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrospray) under history the year 1750 about Jean-Antoine (Abbé) Nollet and the other one in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Antoine\\_Nollet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Antoine_Nollet) under Scientific Work again under the mention of 1750.\n\nThe source of the Electrospray Artikel send me to the Thesis Paper of Grimm,Ronald L. Published in 2006. [https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/3992/12/complete\\_thesis.pdf](https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/3992/12/complete_thesis.pdf) \n\nThere in the Pages 2-2 to 2-3 the event gets again mentioned as an observation of Jean-Antoine  “a person, electrified by connection to a  \nhigh-voltage generator, would not bleed normally if he were to cut himself; blood would spray from the wound.”1 the cited source is mentioned under page 2-18 as  (1) ORNL Review, State of the Laboratory. vol. 29 no. 1-2 1995. http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev29-12/text/environ.htm (accessed June 16, 2005). \n\nThis is the source the wiki articel of jean-antoine\\_nollet points toward, but you cannot find it anymore in the link mentioned in the thesis but in the link from the wiki artikel that sends you to the google books database that has the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Review vol 29 Nos 1-2, 1996 avaibel.\n\nHere its wierd that the year is different from the cited thesis and that in the ORNL review mentioned the company just started existing on its own starting january 1 1996.\n\nAnyway on page 34 of the Reviews Number one and two, 1996, Nollet is mentioned again that he pointed out as an example \" a perso, electrified by connection to a high-voltage generator, would not bleed normally if he were to cut himself; blood would spray from the wound\" and that a portrayal of this even is found as a woodcut in Diderot's encyclopedia. \n\nThis is where i couldnt find any direct citations anymore and started to search for pictures of this woodcut online.\n\nI found two websites that have an extensive databases about encyclopedia where Diderot's was a co-autor.\n\nOne in englisch that contains transcriptes of the encyclopedia: [https://encyclopedie.uchicago.edu/](https://encyclopedie.uchicago.edu/)\n\nAnd one in french that contains transcriptes and pictures of one of the original copies: [https://enccre-diffusion.huma-num.fr/encyclopedie/](https://enccre-diffusion.huma-num.fr/encyclopedie/)\n\nThats where i m stuck, i cannot find any woodcut pictures and there are no mentions of electricity \"électriques\" connected to blood \"sang\", wound \"plaie\" or \"blessure\", aerosolize \"aerosol\" or \"particuliéres\" or spray \"jailir\" or \"arroser\". Especially not connected to Diderot as autor.\n\nI'm guessing that the woodcut pictures are under copyright or something that they wont show them in the databases but i cannot figure out for the life of me how to search for them.\n\nI would really appreaciate any tips or help finding the mentioned woodcut and help me burry this freaking rabithole",
