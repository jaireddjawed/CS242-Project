        "text": "Take a solid short (ie ratio of length to diameter of order unity) cylindrical column made of some elasitic material, with flat parallel faces perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder. Then, compress this column axially between two planes making full contact with the ends. Take the rigidity of the planes as infinite relative to the material of the cylinder: ie the indentation of them in this process is negligible. Also (and this is pretty crucial) the coefficient of sliding friction between the rigid planes doing the squeezing is infinite, so that there is no slippage of the end-faces of the cylinder, &amp; they remain the same size. Also, assume, @ least to begin with, that the bulk modulus of the material of the cylinder is vastly larger than any of the stresses occuring, so that there is no volume-change of the column.\n\nObviously, the column will contract axially-wise ... and it will also belly out. And assume, again @least to begin with, that we're talking about _in the limit of small strain_ .\n\nSo ... finally ... the query is - _what is the stress/strain throughout the cylinder in this scenario_ ? Particularly, what is the pressure on a face as a function of radius?\n\nIt's really frustrating that I _just cannot_  find a treatment of this problem - and I've tried _really_  hard! I have a vague recollection of seeing it treated in a certain physical book years ago ... and I seem to recall it said that the pressure on a face is  _decreasing exponential_  with radius. I just thought I would look this up online, to confirm what I fancy I remember ... but _I just cannot_  find anything!!",

        "text": " So I'm either overcomplicating this question or I might need a Fourier transform. So this relates technically to an Arduino project but this is something that can be applied in a more general sense. I plan to hook up a sensor to an Arduino and some batteries. If the batteries are rated some milliamp hours (maH) then the maximum time my circuit could be active will be the milliamp-hour rating of the battery divided by the current drawn in the circuit. Now this will quickly drain the batteries so it's kind of inefficient now the sensor I'm using doesn't need to take a measurement constantly (it will measure the temp where I live not like it will change fast anyway). So the new plan would be to take measurements once every t seconds then put the Arduino in low power mode for another t seconds (I have yet to learn if I can even do this with an Arduino). This will probably increase the battery life powering the circuit longer since I don't need constant measurements I thought for fun to try and calculate how long the time could last based on the frequency of which the Arduino is on high power than low power. Now here is me assuming a bunch of stuff (perhaps overcomplicating it). The area of the entire square wave should equal the mAH of the battery and the amplitude of the square wave should be around the current needed for the sensor, in order to then find the time before the battery dies would we need a Fourier transform? I have virtually no knowledge about Fourier since I have yet to cover it in any of my classes (In differential eqn's we only covered Laplace). I'm actually curious if this would be the case if Fourier would be needed since I'm aware it is an important thing for engineers and It would be kinda cool if I stumbled on an application that needed one.",

This means that Outlet pressure is 0 (since air), so no issues with using a pilot operated one, since Pressure differential == inlet pressure\n\n**Problem Case** \n\n   2) Final Faucet is closed but \"our valve\" is open.

Is it possible to find a design role if I build up a few years of experience in manufacturing?  Or will they just see someone with no relevant experience and pass me by, causing me to get stuck in a role I'm less interested in?\n\nThis design position has notoriously poor growth potential so I can't just bite the bullet for now and earn my way up in that company. They would be purely for experience and cool work projects.\n\nCan anyone that has been in a similar position advise?",

I'm looking at an application where I'm being asked to resistance spot weld on a steel case containing a large battery. I have lots of concerns, but the one I'm not confident I have all the information about is inductance. When we resistance spot weld we pass a lot of current in a very short amount of time and induce a pretty substantial field, one that can pull steel out of your hands or ruin watches with magnetic components. It's also large enough  that we lose current into nearby steel tools, just for context. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy question is if these fields pose a danger to the battery, both from a performance and a safety standpoint. If there's even a small chance that inducing this field can cause a fire I'd much prefer to shoot down the application entirely, I'm very cautious about large batteries in general.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

Unfortunately, pretty much all the switches I know, such as ones usually used in CNC machines / 3D printers (such as  D2F-L) rely on two conductors inside touching one another. Unfortunately, the water will short it out, creating a premature continuity in the switch. If I fill switch will non-conducting oil to keep water out, oil film will prevent continuity even when conductors touch.\n\nIs there a way to build an endstop switch that will work when filled with water? It would be very difficult to try and make a sealed switch with air inside - that would require enclosures, tight fittings, o-rings and so on, making them bulky and adding lots of points of failure.\n\nAs an alternative, I considered monitoring DC motor current to detect when it stalls and shut it off, but I would like to explore endstop switch option as well.

Encased in 3000 psi concrete.\n\nPainted rebar frame, in maybe 14 flat sections of 4 feet (so not really a cylinder but a tetradecahedron)\n\nForms made out of 2 inch thick 12 foot planks laid out vertically and many horizontal cross brace.\n\nWall thickness 6 inches\n\nTank exterior spray 2 inch closed cell polyurethane  foam, then surrounded by 36*48*90 inch upright desiccated haybales (R72 equivalent insulation)\n\nTank interior \"h-seal\" high temperature resistant sealer, sprayed\n\nTank cover 1/8 hot roll steel sheets, epoxy painted with 1 inch square tubing reinforcements, then haybales on top of that. Sheet steel conical roof on top of that.\n\nThis is seasonal thermal storage, heated using excess solar electrical energy, cold water warmed in hose coils to about 30C and then heat pump running on solar electric. When production exceeds heat pump capacity, direct heat using water tank heaters.\n\nThe hope is that this system would contain in September enough 90C water to replace current electrical heat of 35'000kWh/year.\n\nWhat I'm the least sure about is, foundation strong enough to hold this 166 to 273 tons of water plus 60 tons of concrete. Will the foam boards get crushed. Will too much heat leak out of the bottom.",

Doesn't have to be a reference type book, or strictly mechanically related (he's interested in electrical stuff too). Has anyone any recommendations for interesting books on engineering, or closely related that might also be useful?\n\nAny suggestions welcome, thanks!",
