With the rapid pace and progress of AI, will we see AGI and Singularity event in our life time? I did [write an in-depth article](https://dangtheory.wordpress.com/2023/03/08/rate-of-progress-in-artificial-intelligence-and-the-impending-singularity-weve-been-wrong-before-are-we-right-this-time/) on this topic and do believe we will see it sooner than most expect and agree with Kurzweil's predictions with his support evidence in technology trends.\n\nI recently listened to a [conversation between Naval Ravikant and David Deustch on AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyxepLfH1ZU) and other topics, and Deustch's perspective is we're not on the right direction of AGI, since AGI would be to learn and develop knowledge of things without the need of supervised learning and rules and information that it wasn't trained or programmed on. Human's also need supervised learning from other humans. I think we'll get there soon but perhaps he's right that supervised learning may only go so far. [Deustch also had an interesting conversation with Sam Harris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5FBdYsCmLk) about AI concerns and he thinks they're overblown and we'll have time to work with AGI, to help mitigate any AI apocalyptic risks.\n\nWith more insight into GPT-4's capabilities, it's hard to say we're not headed in the right direction overall.",

I can only come up with few things human might be able to justifies its existence. (giving the current understanding of physics)\n\nhumans are analog, harder to hack than robots or interfere with its signals the way robots can. social manipulation will took more time than taking over a rival robot. \n\nhumans are self contained to a extant, we somewhat energy efficient, somewhat self repair body. we can carry our entire being around. ASI might choose to scale its hardware to prefer performance while trade off its mobility.   maybe like how human trade to have smarter intelligence over a weaker body, maybe AIs will make similar trade offs that make them more fragile, more it choice to be more resiliency at a cost of efficiency.\n\n AI might run into some problem even themselves hard to fix. for example a sub module of AI decide to do paper clip maximum and the main AI have to fight the cancer it created.\n\nI am out of Ideas hope you guys who know the field better come up with something",

The ML system wouldn’t be perfect by any means so I guess it would also need a database of published menu info from restaurant chains. Not sure how feasible it would be for an indie developer to tackle but would be a perfect killer app for Apple to bundle if and when they build their first mixed reality headset. I suspect though that Apple would never take the risk of releasing an imperfect system. Thoughts?",

        "text": "\"BuT ThAt'S hOw HuMaNs ArE LiKe As WeLl!\"\n\nWhy do people think that this is a clever response or a valid point? If you point out that \"AI\" is actually unoriginal and only regurgitating whatever the humans have already made, then they will retort that neither are most humans original. It's like they're lowering the standards of what the humans are capable of, and if the \"AI\" reach that low standard, then bam! AI has magically reached human-level intelligence! Genius!\n\nActually, that is not only a stupid way of looking at things, but also wrong. The fact is that humans are capable of a *general* intelligence, meaning that humans are capable *any* kind of intelligence that is possible. The fact is that humans can be both original *and* unoriginal. If the AI is only capable of the unoriginal part, then that's not a general intelligence, and hence, it's not human-level intelligence.\n\nSure, you can say that AI is capable of a small part of human intelligence, but you can't say that they have reached the level of general, human-level intelligence. Not until we have created an AGI, which isn't likely to happen anytime soon at this rate.",
